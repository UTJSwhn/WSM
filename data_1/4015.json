                "SCENE I",
                "SCENE -- The firemen's forecastle of a transatlantic liner an hour after\nsailing from New York for the voyage across. Tiers of narrow, steel\nbunks, three deep, on all sides. An entrance in rear. Benches on the\nfloor before the bunks. The room is crowded with men, shouting,\ncursing, laughing, singing -- a confused, inchoate uproar swelling into a\nsort of unity, a meaning -- the bewildered, furious, baffled defiance of\na beast in a cage. Nearly all the men are drunk. Many bottles are\npassed from hand to hand. All are dressed in dungaree pants, heavy ugly\nshoes. Some wear singlets, but the majority are stripped to the waist.",
                "The treatment of this scene, or of any other scene in the play, should\nby no means be naturalistic. The effect sought after is a cramped space\nin the bowels of a ship, imprisoned by white steel. The lines of bunks,\nthe uprights supporting them, cross each other like the steel framework\nof a cage. The ceiling crushes down upon the men's heads. They cannot\nstand upright. This accentuates the natural stooping posture which\nshovelling coal and the resultant over-development of back and shoulder\nmuscles have given them. The men themselves should resemble those\npictures in which the appearance of Neanderthal Man is guessed at. All\nare hairy-chested, with long arms of tremendous power, and low,\nreceding brows above their small, fierce, resentful eyes. All the\ncivilized white races are represented, but except for the slight\ndifferentiation in color of hair, skin, eyes, all these men are alike.",
                "The curtain rises on a tumult of sound. YANK is seated in the\nforeground. He seems broader, fiercer, more truculent, more powerful,\nmore sure of himself than the rest. They respect his superior\nstrength -- the grudging respect of fear. Then, too, he represents to\nthem a self-expression, the very last word in what they are, their most\nhighly developed individual.",
                "VOICES -- Gif me trink dere, you!\n\n'Ave a wet!\n\nSalute!\n\nGesundheit!\n\nSkoal!\n\nDrunk as a lord, God stiffen you!\n\nHere's how!\n\nLuck!\n\nPass back that bottle, damn you!\n\nPourin' it down his neck!\n\nHo, Froggy!

Where d'yuh get dat beer stuff? Beer, hell!\nBeer's for goils -- and Dutchmen. Me for somep'n wit a kick to it! Gimme\na drink, one of youse guys. [Several bottles are eagerly offered. He\ntakes a tremendous gulp at one of them; then, keeping the bottle in his\nhand, glares belligerently at the owner, who hastens to acquiesce in\nthis robbery by saying:] All righto, Yank. Keep it and have another.\"\n[Yank contemptuously turns his back on the crowd again. For a second\nthere is an embarrassed silence. Then -- ]",
                "VOICES -- We must be passing the Hook. She's beginning to roll to it. Six\ndays in hell -- and then Southampton. Py Yesus, I vish somepody take my\nfirst vatch for me!

Where's Paddy? Going asleep. Sing us that whiskey song, Paddy.\n[They all turn to an old, wizened Irishman who is dozing, very drunk,\non the benches forward. His face is extremely monkey-like with all the\nsad, patient pathos of that animal in his small eyes.] Singa da song,\nCaruso Pat! He's gettin' old. The drink is too much for him. He's too\ndrunk.",
                "PADDY -- [Blinking about him, starts to his feet resentfully, swaying,\nholding on to the edge of a bunk.] I'm never too drunk to sing. 'Tis\nonly when I'm dead to the world I'd be wishful to sing at all. [With a\nsort of sad contempt.] \"Whiskey Johnny,\" ye want? A chanty, ye want?\nNow that's a queer wish from the ugly like of you, God help you. But no\nmatther. [He starts to sing in a thin, nasal, doleful tone:]",
                "Oh, whiskey is the life of man!\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whiskey! O Johnny!",

Take it easy, see. Give us a\nrest. Nix on de loud noise. [With a cynical grin.] Can't youse see\nI'm tryin' to t'ink?",
                "ALL -- [Repeating the word after him as one with same cynical amused\nmockery.] Think! [The chorused word has a brazen metallic quality as\nif their throats were phonograph horns. It is followed by a general\nuproar of hard, barking laughter.]",
                "VOICES -- Don't be cracking your head wid ut, Yank.\n\nYou gat headache, py yingo!\n\nOne thing about it -- it rhymes with drink!\n\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nDrink, don't think!\n\nDrink, don't think!\n\nDrink, don't think!",
                "[A whole chorus of voices has taken up this refrain, stamping on the\nfloor, pounding on the benches with fists.]",
                "YANK -- [Taking a gulp from his bottle -- good-naturedly.] Aw right. Can\nde noise. I got yuh de foist time. [The uproar subsides. A very\ndrunken sentimental tenor begins to sing:]",
                "\"Far away in Canada,\n    Far across the sea,\n    There's a lass who fondly waits\n    Making a home for me -- \"",
                "YANK -- [Fiercely contemptuous.] Shut up, yuh lousey boob! Where d'yuh\nget dat tripe? Home? Home, hell! I'll make a home for yuh! I'll knock\nyuh dead. Home! T'hell wit home! Where d'yuh get dat tripe? Dis is\nhome, see? What d'yuh want wit home? [Proudly.] I runned away from\nmine when I was a kid. On'y too glad to beat it, dat was me. Home was\nlickings for me, dat's all. But yuh can bet your shoit noone ain't\nnever licked me since! Wanter try it, any of youse? Huh! I guess not.\n[In a more placated but still contemptuous tone.] Goils waitin' for\nyuh, huh? Aw, hell! Dat's all tripe. Dey don't wait for noone. Dey'd\ndouble-cross yuh for a nickel. Dey're all tarts, get me? Treat 'em\nrough, dat's me. To hell wit 'em. Tarts, dat's what, de whole bunch of\n'em.",
                "LONG -- [Very drunk, jumps on a bench excitedly, gesticulating with a\nbottle in his hand.] Listen 'ere, Comrades! Yank 'ere is right. 'E\nsays this 'ere stinkin' ship is our 'ome.

We wasn't born this rotten way. All men is born free and\nekal. That's in the bleedin' Bible, maties. But what d'they care for\nthe Bible -- them lazy, bloated swine what travels first cabin? Them's\nthe ones. They dragged us down 'til we're on'y wage slaves in the\nbowels of a bloody ship, sweatin', burnin' up, eatin' coal dust! Hit's\nthem's ter blame -- the damned capitalist clarss! [There had been a\ngradual murmur of contemptuous resentment rising among the men until\nnow he is interrupted by a storm of catcalls, hisses, boos, hard\nlaughter.]",

De Cap'tlist class, huh? Aw nix on dat\nSalvation Army-Socialist bull. Git a soapbox! Hire a hall! Come and be\nsaved, huh? Jerk us to Jesus, huh? Aw g'wan! I've listened to lots of\nguys like you, see, Yuh're all wrong. Wanter know what I t'ink? Yuh\nain't no good for noone. Yuh're de bunk. Yuh ain't got no noive, get\nme? Yuh're yellow, dat's what. Yellow, dat's you. Say! What's dem slobs\nin de foist cabin got to do wit us? We're better men dan dey are, ain't\nwe? Sure! One of us guys could clean up de whole mob wit one mit. Put\none of 'em down here for one watch in de stokehole, what'd happen?\nDey'd carry him off on a stretcher. Dem boids don't amount to nothin'.\nDey're just baggage. Who makes dis old tub run? Ain't it us guys? Well\nden, we belong, don't we? We belong and dey don't. Dat's all. [A loud\nchorus of approval. Yank goes on] As for dis bein' hell -- aw, nuts! Yuh\nlost your noive, dat's what. Dis is a man's job, get me? It belongs. It\nruns dis tub. No stiffs need apply. But yuh're a stiff, see? Yuh're\nyellow, dat's you.",
                "VOICES -- [With a great hard pride in them.]\n\nRighto!\n\nA man's job!\n\nTalk is cheap, Long.\n\nHe never could hold up his end.\n<\nDivil take him!\n\nYank's right.

                "YANK -- [Half good-natured again -- contemptuously.] Aw, take it easy.\nLeave him alone. He ain't woith a punch. Drink up. Here's how, whoever\nowns dis. [He takes a long swallow from his bottle. All drink with\nhim. In a flash all is hilarious amiability again, back-slapping, loud\ntalk, etc.]",
                "PADDY -- [Who has been sitting in a blinking, melancholy daze -- suddenly\ncries out in a voice full of old sorrow.] We belong to this, you're\nsaying? We make the ship to go, you're saying? Yerra then, that\nAlmighty God have pity on us! [His voice runs into the wail of a keen,\nhe rocks back and forth on his bench. The men stare at him, startled\nand impressed in spite of themselves.] Oh, to be back in the fine days\nof my youth, ochone! Oh, there was fine beautiful ships them\ndays -- clippers wid tall masts touching the sky -- fine strong men in\nthem -- men that was sons of the sea as if 'twas the mother that bore\nthem. Oh, the clean skins of them, and the clear eyes, the straight\nbacks and full chests of them! Brave men they was, and bold men surely!\nWe'd be sailing out, bound down round the Horn maybe. We'd be making\nsail in the dawn, with a fair breeze, singing a chanty song wid no care\nto it. And astern the land would be sinking low and dying out, but we'd\ngive it no heed but a laugh, and never a look behind. For the day that\nwas, was enough, for we was free men -- and I'm thinking 'tis only slaves\ndo be giving heed to the day that's gone or the day to come -- until\nthey're old like me. [With a sort of religious exaltation.] Oh, to be\nscudding south again wid the power of the Trade Wind driving her on\nsteady through the nights and the days! Full sail on her! Nights and\ndays! Nights when the foam of the wake would be flaming wid fire, when\nthe sky'd be blazing and winking wid stars. Or the full of the moon\nmaybe. Then you'd see her driving through the gray night, her sails\nstretching aloft all silver and white, not a sound on the deck, the lot\nof us dreaming dreams, till you'd believe 'twas no real ship at all you\nwas on but a ghost ship like the Flying Dutchman they say does be\nroaming the seas forevermore widout touching a port. And there was the\ndays, too. A warm sun on the clean decks. Sun warming the blood of you,\nand wind over the miles of shiny green ocean like strong drink to your\nlungs. Work -- aye, hard work -- but who'd mind that at all? Sure, you\nworked under the sky and 'twas work wid skill and daring to it. And wid\nthe day done, in the dog watch, smoking me pipe at ease, the lookout\nwould be raising land maybe, and we'd see the mountains of South\nAmericy wid the red fire of the setting sun painting their white tops\nand the clouds floating by them! [His tone of exaltation ceases. He\ngoes on mournfully.] Yerra, what's the use of talking? 'Tis a dead\nman's whisper. [To Yank resentfully.] 'Twas them days men belonged to\nships, not now. 'Twas them days a ship was part of the sea, and a man\nwas part of a ship, and the sea joined all together and made it one.\n[Scornfully.] Is it one wid this you'd be, Yank -- black smoke from the\nfunnels smudging the sea, smudging the decks -- the bloody engines\npounding and throbbing and shaking -- wid divil a sight of sun or a\nbreath of clean air -- choking our lungs wid coal dust -- breaking our\nbacks and hearts in the hell of the stokehole -- feeding the bloody\nfurnace -- feeding our lives along wid the coal, I'm thinking -- caged in\nby steel from a sight of the sky like bloody apes in the Zoo! [With a\nharsh laugh.] Ho-ho, divil mend you! Is it to belong to that you're\nwishing? Is it a flesh and blood wheel of the engines you'd be?",
                "YANK -- [Who has been listening with a contemptuous sneer, barks out the\nanswer.] Sure ting! Dat's me! What about it?",
                "PADDY -- [As if to himself -- with great sorrow.] Me time is past due.\nThat a great wave wid sun in the heart of it may sweep me over the side\nsometime I'd be dreaming of the days that's gone!",
                "YANK -- Aw, yuh crazy Mick! [He springs to his feet and advances on\nPaddy threateningly -- then stops, fighting some queer struggle within\nhimself -- lets his hands fall to his sides -- contemptuously.] Aw, take\nit easy. Yuh're aw right, at dat. Yuh're bugs, dat's all -- nutty as a\ncuckoo. All dat tripe yuh been pullin' -- Aw, dat's all right. On'y it's\ndead, get me? Yuh don't belong no more, see. Yuh don't get de stuff.\nYuh're too old. [Disgustedly.] But aw say, come up for air onct in a\nwhile, can't yuh? See what's happened since yuh croaked. [He suddenly\nbursts forth vehemently, growing more and more excited.] Say! Sure!\nSure I meant it! What de hell -- Say, lemme talk! Hey! Hey, you old Harp!\nHey, youse guys! Say, listen to me -- wait a moment -- I gotter talk, see.\nI belong and he don't. He's dead but I'm livin'. Listen to me! Sure I'm\npart of de engines! Why de hell not! Dey move, don't dey? Dey're speed,\nain't dey? Dey smash trou, don't dey? Twenty-five knots a hour! Dat's\ngoin' some! Dat's new stuff! Dat belongs! But him, he's too old. He\ngets dizzy. Say, listen. All dat crazy tripe about nights and days; all\ndat crazy tripe about stars and moons; all dat crazy tripe about suns\nand winds, fresh air and de rest of it -- Aw hell, dat's all a dope\ndream! Hittin' de pipe of de past, dat's what he's doin'. He's old and\ndon't belong no more. But me, I'm young! I'm in de pink! I move wit it!\nIt, get me! I mean de ting dat's de guts of all dis. It ploughs trou\nall de tripe he's been sayin'. It blows dat up! It knocks dat dead! It\nslams dat off en de face of de oith! It, get me! De engines and de coal\nand de smoke and all de rest of it! He can't breathe and swallow coal\ndust, but I kin, see? Dat's fresh air for me! Dat's food for me! I'm\nnew, get me? Hell in de stokehole? Sure! It takes a man to work in\nhell. Hell, sure, dat's my fav'rite climate. I eat it up! I git fat on\nit! It's me makes it hot! It's me makes it roar! It's me makes it move!\nSure, on'y for me everyting stops. It all goes dead, get me? De noise\nand smoke and all de engines movin' de woild, dey stop. Dere ain't\nnothin' no more! Dat's what I'm sayin'. Everyting else dat makes de\nwoild move, somep'n makes it move. It can't move witout somep'n else,\nsee? Den yuh get down to me. I'm at de bottom, get me! Dere ain't\nnothin' foither. I'm de end! I'm de start! I start somep'n and de woild\nmoves! It -- dat's me! -- de new dat's moiderin' de old! I'm de ting in\ncoal dat makes it boin; I'm steam and oil for de engines; I'm de ting\nin noise dat makes yuh hear it; I'm smoke and express trains and\nsteamers and factory whistles; I'm de ting in gold dat makes it money!\nAnd I'm what makes iron into steel! Steel, dat stands for de whole\nting! And I'm steel -- steel -- steel! I'm de muscles in steel, de punch\nbehind it! [As he says this he pounds with his fist against the steel\nbunks. All the men, roused to a pitch of frenzied self-glorification by\nhis speech, do likewise. There is a deafening metallic roar, through\nwhich Yank's voice can be heard bellowing.] Slaves, hell! We run de\nwhole woiks. All de rich guys dat tink dey're somep'n, dey ain't\nnothin'! Dey don't belong. But us guys, we're in de move, we're at de\nbottom, de whole ting is us! [Paddy from the start of Yank's speech\nhas been taking one gulp after another from his bottle, at first\nfrightenedly, as if he were afraid to listen, then desperately, as if\nto drown his senses, but finally has achieved complete indifferent,\neven amused, drunkenness. Yank sees his lips moving. He quells the\nuproar with a shout.] Hey, youse guys, take it easy! Wait a moment! De\nnutty Harp is sayin' someth'n.",
                "PADDY -- [Is heard now -- throws his head back with a mocking burst of\nlaughter.] Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho -- -",
                "YANK -- [Drawing back his fist, with a snarl.] Aw! Look out who yuh're\ngivin' the bark!",

                "\"I care for nobody, no, not I,\n    And nobody cares for me.\"",
                "YANK -- [Good-natured himself in a flash, interrupts PADDY with a slap\non the bare back like a report.] Dat's de stuff! Now yuh're gettin'\nwise to somep'n. Care for nobody, dat's de dope! To hell wit 'em all!\nAnd nix on nobody else carin'. I kin care for myself, get me! [Eight\nbells sound, muffled, vibrating through the steel walls as if some\nenormous brazen gong were imbedded in the heart of the ship. All the\nmen jump up mechanically, file through the door silently close upon each\nother's heels in what is very like a prisoners lockstep. YANK slaps\nPADDY on the back.] Our watch, yuh old Harp! [Mockingly.] Come on\ndown in hell. Eat up de coal dust. Drink in de heat. It's it, see! Act\nlike yuh liked it, yuh better -- or croak yuhself.",
                "PADDY -- [With jovial defiance.] To the divil wid it! I'll not report\nthis watch. Let thim log me and be damned. I'm no slave the like of\nyou. I'll be sittin' here at me ease, and drinking, and thinking, and\ndreaming dreams.",

But we drive trou dat, don't we? We split\ndat up and smash trou -- twenty-five knots a hour! [Turns his back on\nPaddy scornfully.] Aw, yuh make me sick! Yuh don't belong!

The former is a\ngirl of twenty, slender, delicate, with a pale, pretty face marred by a\nself-conscious expression of disdainful superiority. She looks fretful,\nnervous and discontented, bored by her own anemia. Her aunt is a\npompous and proud -- and fat -- old lady. She is a type even to the point\nof a double chin and lorgnettes. She is dressed pretentiously, as if\nafraid her face alone would never indicate her position in life.\nMILDRED is dressed all in white.",
                "The impression to be conveyed by this scene is one of the beautiful,\nvivid life of the sea all about -- sunshine on the deck in a great flood,\nthe fresh sea wind blowing across it. In the midst of this, these two\nincongruous, artificial figures, inert and disharmonious, the elder\nlike a gray lump of dough touched up with rouge, the younger looking as\nif the vitality of her stock had been sapped before she was conceived,\nso that she is the expression not of its life energy but merely of the\nartificialities that energy had won for itself in the spending.",
                "MILDRED -- [Looking up with affected dreaminess.] How the black smoke\nswirls back against the sky! Is it not beautiful?",
                "AUNT -- [Without looking up.] I dislike smoke of any kind.",

                "AUNT -- [With a bitter laugh.] Merci for your candor. But since I am\nand must be your chaperone -- in appearance, at least -- let us patch up\nsome sort of armed truce.

Well, I hope Whitechapel will provide the needed nerve\ntonic. Do not ask me to chaperone you there, however. I told your\nfather I would not. I loathe deformity. We will hire an army of\ndetectives and you may investigate everything -- they allow you to see.",

Give me\ncredit for some sort of groping sincerity in that at least. I would\nlike to help them. I would like to be some use in the world. Is it my\nfault I don't know how? I would like to be sincere, to touch life\nsomewhere. [With weary bitterness.] But I'm afraid I have neither the\nvitality nor integrity. All that was burnt out in our stock before I\nwas born. Grandfather's blast furnaces, flaming to the sky, melting\nsteel, making millions -- then father keeping those home fires burning,\nmaking more millions -- and little me at the tail-end of it all. I'm a\nwaste product in the Bessemer process -- like the millions. Or rather, I\ninherit the acquired trait of the by-product, wealth, but none of the\nenergy, none of the strength of the steel that made it. I am sired by\ngold and darned by it, as they say at the race track -- damned in more\nways than one, [She laughs mirthlessly].",
                "AUNT -- [Unimpressed -- superciliously.] You seem to be going in for\nsincerity to-day. It isn't becoming to you, really -- except as an\nobvious pose. Be as artificial as you are, I advise. There's a sort of\nsincerity in that, you know. And, after all, you must confess you like\nthat better.",
                "MILDRED -- [Again affected and bored.] Yes, I suppose I do. Pardon me\nfor my outburst. When a leopard complains of its spots, it must sound\nrather grotesque. [In a mocking tone.] Purr, little leopard. Purr,\nscratch, tear, kill, gorge yourself and be happy -- only stay in the\njungle where your spots are camouflage. In a cage they make you\nconspicuous.",
                "AUNT -- I don't know what you are talking about.",
                "MILDRED -- It would be rude to talk about anything to you. Let's just\ntalk. [She looks at her wrist watch.] Well, thank goodness, it's\nabout time for them to come for me. That ought to give me a new thrill,\nAunt.",
                "AUNT -- [Affectedly troubled.] You don't mean to say you're really\ngoing? The dirt -- the heat must be frightful --",
                "MILDRED -- Grandfather started as a puddler. I should have inherited an\nimmunity to heat that would make a salamander shiver. It will be fun to\nput it to the test.",
                "AUNT -- But don't you have to have the captain's -- or\nsomeone's -- permission to visit the stokehole?",
                "MILDRED -- [With a triumphant smile.] I have it -- both his and the chief\nengineer's. Oh, they didn't want to at first, in spite of my social\nservice credentials. They didn't seem a bit anxious that I should\ninvestigate how the other half lives and works on a ship. So I had to\ntell them that my father, the president of Nazareth Steel, chairman of\nthe board of directors of this line, had told me it would be all right.",
                "AUNT -- He didn't.",
                "MILDRED -- How naive age makes one! But I said he did, Aunt. I even said\nhe had given me a letter to them -- which I had lost. And they were\nafraid to take the chance that I might be lying. [Excitedly.] So it's\nho! for the stokehole. The second engineer is to escort me. [Looking\nat her watch again.] It's time. And here he comes, I think. [The\nSECOND ENGINEER enters, He is a husky, fine-looking man of thirty-five\nor so. He stops before the two and tips his cap, visibly embarrassed\nand ill-at-ease.]",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- Miss Douglas?",
                "MILDRED -- Yes. [Throwing off her rugs and getting to her feet.] Are we\nall ready to start?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- In just a second, ma'am. I'm waiting for the Fourth.\nHe's coming along.",
                "MILDRED -- [With a scornful smile.] You don't care to shoulder this\nresponsibility alone, is that it?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [Forcing a smile.] Two are better than one.\n[Disturbed by her eyes, glances out to sea -- blurts out.] A fine day\nwe're having.",
                "MILDRED -- Is it?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- A nice warm breeze --",
                "MILDRED -- It feels cold to me.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- But it's hot enough in the sun --",
                "MILDRED -- Not hot enough for me. I don't like Nature. I was never\nathletic.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [Forcing a smile.] Well, you'll find it hot enough\nwhere you're going.",
                "MILDRED -- Do you mean hell?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [Flabbergasted, decides to laugh.] Ho-ho! No, I mean\nthe stokehole.",
                "MILDRED -- My grandfather was a puddler. He played with boiling steel.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [All at sea -- uneasily.] Is that so? Hum, you'll\nexcuse me, ma'am, but are you intending to wear that dress.",
                "MILDRED -- Why not?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- You'll likely rub against oil and dirt. It can't be\nhelped.",
                "MILDRED -- It doesn't matter. I have lots of white dresses.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- I have an old coat you might throw over --",
                "MILDRED -- I have fifty dresses like this. I will throw this one into the\nsea when I come back. That ought to wash it clean, don't you think?",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [Doggedly.] There's ladders to climb down that are\nnone too clean -- and dark alleyways --",
                "MILDRED -- I will wear this very dress and none other.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- No offence meant. It's none of my business. I was only\nwarning you --",
                "MILDRED -- Warning? That sounds thrilling.",
                "SECOND ENGINEER -- [Looking down the deck -- with a sigh of\nrelief.] -- There's the Fourth now. He's waiting for us. If you'll come --",
                "MILDRED -- Go on. I'll follow you. [He goes. Mildred turns a mocking\nsmile on her aunt.] An oaf -- but a handsome, virile oaf.",

                "AUNT -- Yes, for a fresh pose I have no doubt you would drag the name of\nDouglas in the gutter!",

                "SCENE III",
                "SCENE -- The stokehole. In the rear, the dimly-outlined bulks of the\nfurnaces and boilers. High overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds\njust enough light through the murky air laden with coal dust to pile up\nmasses of shadows everywhere. A line of men, stripped to the waist, is\nbefore the furnace doors. They bend over, looking neither to right nor\nleft, handling their shovels as if they were part of their bodies, with\na strange, awkward, swinging rhythm. They use the shovels to throw open\nthe furnace doors. Then from these fiery round holes in the black a\nflood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are\noutlined in silhouette in the crouching, inhuman attitudes of chained\ngorillas. The men shovel with a rhythmic motion, swinging as on a pivot\nfrom the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into\nthe flaming mouths before them. There is a tumult of noise -- the brazen\nclang of the furnace doors as they are flung open or slammed shut, the\ngrating, teeth-gritting grind of steel against steel, of crunching\ncoal. This clash of sounds stuns one's ears with its rending\ndissonance. But there is order in it, rhythm, a mechanical regulated\nrecurrence, a tempo. And rising above all, making the air hum with the\nquiver of liberated energy, the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces,\nthe monotonous throbbing beat of the engines.",
                "As the curtain rises, the furnace doors are shut. The men are taking a\nbreathing spell. One or two are arranging the coal behind them, pulling\nit into more accessible heaps. The others can be dimly made out leaning\non their shovels in relaxed attitudes of exhaustion.",

Open her up! [At this last all the\nmen, who have followed his movements of getting into position, throw\nopen their furnace doors with a deafening clang. The fiery light floods\nover their shoulders as they bend round for the coal. Rivulets of sooty\nsweat have traced maps on their backs. The enlarged muscles form\nbunches of high light and shadow.]",

She starts, turns paler, her pose is\ncrumbling, she shivers with fright in spite of the blazing heat, but\nforces herself to leave the Engineers and take a few steps nearer the\nmen. She is right behind Yank. All this happens quickly while the men\nhave their backs turned.]",
                "YANK -- Come on, youse guys! [He is turning to get coal when the whistle\nsounds again in a peremptory, irritating note. This drives Yank into a\nsudden fury. While the other men have turned full around and stopped\ndumfounded by the spectacle of Mildred standing there in her white\ndress, Yank does not turn far enough to see her. Besides, his head is\nthrown back, he blinks upward through the murk trying to find the owner\nof the whistle, he brandishes his shovel murderously over his head in\none hand, pounding on his chest, gorilla-like, with the other,\nshouting:] Toin off dat whistle!

He sees Mildred,\nlike a white apparition in the full light from the open furnace doors.\nHe glares into her eyes, turned to stone. As for her, during his speech\nshe has listened, paralyzed with horror, terror, her whole personality\ncrushed, beaten in, collapsed, by the terrific impact of this unknown,\nabysmal brutality, naked and shameless. As she looks at his gorilla\nface, as his eyes bore into hers, she utters a low, choking cry and\nshrinks away from him, putting both hands up before her eyes to shut\nout the sight of his face, to protect her own. This startles Yank to a\nreaction. His mouth falls open, his eyes grow bewildered.]",
                "MILDRED -- [About to faint -- to the Engineers, who now have her one by\neach arm -- whimperingly.] Take me away! Oh, the filthy beast! [She\nfaints. They carry her quickly back, disappearing in the darkness at\nthe left, rear. An iron door clangs shut. Rage and bewildered fury rush\nback on Yank. He feels himself insulted in some unknown fashion in the\nvery heart of his pride. He roars:] God damn yuh! [And hurls his\nshovel after them at the door which has just closed. It hits the steel\nbulkhead with a clang and falls clattering on the steel floor. From\noverhead the whistle sounds again in a long, angry, insistent command.]",

A general atmosphere of clean, well-tidied, wide\nstreet; a flood of mellow, tempered sunshine; gentle, genteel breezes.\nIn the rear, the show windows of two shops, a jewelry establishment on\nthe corner, a furrier's next to it. Here the adornments of extreme\nwealth are tantalizingly displayed. The jeweler's window is gaudy with\nglittering diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls, etc., fashioned in\nornate tiaras, crowns, necklaces, collars, etc. From each piece hangs\nan enormous tag from which a dollar sign and numerals in intermittent\nelectric lights wink out the incredible prices. The same in the\nfurrier's. Rich furs of all varieties hang there bathed in a downpour\nof artificial light. The general effect is of a background of\nmagnificence cheapened and made grotesque by commercialism, a\nbackground in tawdry disharmony with the clear light and sunshine on\nthe street itself.",

A fireman's cap with black peak is cocked defiantly on\nthe side of his head. He has not shaved for days and around his fierce,\nresentful eyes -- as around those of Long to a lesser degree -- the black\nsmudge of coal dust still sticks like make-up. They hesitate and stand\ntogether at the corner, swaggering, looking about them with a forced,\ndefiant contempt.",

I know an old boiler down to de docks we kin\ncrawl into. [The lady stalks by without a look, without a change of\npace. YANK turns to others -- insultingly.] Holy smokes, what a mug! Go\nhide yuhself before de horses shy at yuh. Gee, pipe de heinie on dat\none! Say, youse, yuh look like de stoin of a ferryboat. Paint and\npowder! All dolled up to kill!

[But as they\nseem neither to see nor hear him, he flies into a fury.] Bums! Pigs!\nTarts! Bitches! [He turns in a rage on the men, bumping viciously into\nthem but not jarring them the least bit. Rather it is he who recoils\nafter each collision. He keeps growling.] Git off de oith! G'wan, yuh\nbum! Look where yuh're goin,' can't yuh? Git outa here! Fight, why\ndon't yuh? Put up yer mits! Don't be a dog! Fight or I'll knock yuh\ndead! [But, without seeming to see him, they all answer with\nmechanical affected politeness:] I beg your pardon. [Then at a cry\nfrom one of the women, they all scurry to the furrier's window.]",
                "THE WOMAN -- [Ecstatically, with a gasp of delight.] Monkey fur! [The\nwhole crowd of men and women chorus after her in the same tone of\naffected delight.] Monkey fur!",
                "YANK -- [With a jerk of his head back on his shoulders, as if he had\nreceived a punch full in the face -- raging.] I see yuh, all in white! I\nsee yuh, yuh white-faced tart, yuh! Hairy ape, huh? I'll hairy ape yuh!\n[He bends down and grips at the street curbing as if to pluck it out\nand hurl it. Foiled in this, snarling with passion, he leaps to the\nlamp-post on the corner and tries to pull it up for a club. Just at\nthat moment a bus is heard rumbling up. A fat, high-hatted, spatted\ngentleman runs out from the side street. He calls out plaintively:\n\"Bus! Bus! Stop there!\" and runs full tilt into the bending, straining\nYANK, who is bowled off his balance.]",
                "YANK -- [Seeing a fight -- with a roar of joy as he springs to his feet.]\nAt last! Bus, huh? I'll bust yuh! [He lets drive a terrific swing, his\nfist landing full on the fat gentleman's face. But the gentleman stands\nunmoved as if nothing had happened.]",
                "GENTLEMAN -- I beg your pardon. [Then irritably.] You have made me lose\nmy bus. [He claps his hands and begins to scream:] Officer! Officer!\n[Many police whistles shrill out on the instant and a whole platoon of\npolicemen rush in on YANK from all sides. He tries to fight but is\nclubbed to the pavement and fallen upon. The crowd at the window have\nnot moved or noticed this disturbance. The clanging gong of the patrol\nwagon approaches with a clamoring din.]",

Moonlight on the narrow street, buildings massed in\nblack shadow. The interior of the room, which is general assembly room,\noffice, and reading room, resembles some dingy settlement boys club. A\ndesk and high stool are in one corner. A table with papers, stacks of\npamphlets, chairs about it, is at center. The whole is decidedly cheap,\nbanal, commonplace and unmysterious as a room could well be. The\nsecretary is perched on the stool making entries in a large ledger. An\neye shade casts his face into shadows. Eight or ten men, longshoremen,\niron workers, and the like, are grouped about the table. Two are\nplaying checkers. One is writing a letter. Most of them are smoking\npipes. A big signboard is on the wall at the rear, \"Industrial Workers\nof the World -- Local No. 57.\"",

He comes to a point opposite the\ndoor; tiptoes softly up to it, listens, is impressed by the silence\nwithin, knocks carefully, as if he were guessing at the password to\nsome secret rite. Listens. No answer. Knocks again a bit louder. No\nanswer. Knocks impatiently, much louder.]",
                "SECRETARY -- [Turning around on his stool.] What the devil is\nthat -- someone knocking? [Shouts:] Come in, why don't you? [All the\nmen in the room look up. YANK opens the door slowly, gingerly, as if\nafraid of an ambush. He looks around for secret doors, mystery, is\ntaken aback by the commonplaceness of the room and the men in it,\nthinks he may have gotten in the wrong place, then sees the signboard\non the wall and is reassured.]",

                "SECRETARY -- [Stepping away from YANK.] Very interesting. [He gives a\nsignal. The men, huskies all, throw themselves on YANK and before he\nknows it they have his legs and arms pinioned. But he is too\nflabbergasted to make a struggle, anyway. They feel him over for\nweapons.]",
                "MAN -- No gat, no knife. Shall we give him what's what and put the boots\nto him?",
                "SECRETARY -- No. He isn't worth the trouble we'd get into. He's too\nstupid.

No, by God, you're such a\nbonehead I'll bet you're in the Secret Service! Well, you dirty spy,\nyou rotten agent provocator, you can go back and tell whatever skunk is\npaying you blood-money for betraying your brothers that he's wasting\nhis coin. You couldn't catch a cold. And tell him that all he'll ever\nget on us, or ever has got, is just his own sneaking plots that he's\nframed up to put us in jail. We are what our manifesto says we are,\nneither more or less -- and we'll give him a copy of that any time he\ncalls. And as for you -- [He glares scornfully at YANK, who is sunk in\nan oblivious stupor.] Oh, hell, what's the use of talking? You're a\nbrainless ape.",

                "SECRETARY -- Throw him out, boys. [In spite of his struggles, this is\ndone with gusto and eclat. Propelled by several parting kicks, YANK\nlands sprawling in the middle of the narrow cobbled street. With a\ngrowl he starts to get up and storm the closed door, but stops\nbewildered by the confusion in his brain, pathetically impotent. He\nsits there, brooding, in as near to the attitude of Rodin's \"Thinker\"\nas he can get in his position.]",
                "YANK -- [Bitterly.] So dem boids don't tink I belong, neider. Aw, to\nhell wit 'em! Dey're in de wrong pew -- de same old bull -- soapboxes and\nSalvation Army -- no guts!

Now I ain't steel, and de woild owns me. Aw, hell! I\ncan't see -- it's all dark, get me? It's all wrong!

YANK walks up to the gorilla's\ncage and, leaning over the railing, stares in at its occupant, who\nstares back at him, silent and motionless. There is a pause of dead\nstillness. Then YANK begins to talk in a friendly confidential tone,\nhalf-mockingly, but with a deep undercurrent of sympathy.] Say, yuh're\nsome hard-lookin' guy, ain't yuh?

Yuh're de on'y one in de woild dat does, yuh lucky stiff! [The\ngorilla growls proudly.] And dat's why dey gotter put yuh in a cage,\nsee? [The gorilla roars angrily.] Sure! Yuh get me. It beats it when\nyou try to tink it or talk it -- it's way down -- deep -- behind -- you 'n' me\nwe feel it. Sure! Bot' members of dis club! [He laughs -- then in a\nsavage tone.] What de hell! T' hell wit it! A little action, dat's our\nmeat! Dat belongs! Knock 'em down and keep bustin' 'em till dey croaks\nyuh wit a gat -- wit steel! Sure! Are yuh game? Dey've looked at youse,\nain't dey -- in a cage? Wanter git even? Wanter wind up like a sport\n'stead of croakin' slow in dere? [The gorilla roars an emphatic\naffirmative. YANK goes on with a sort of furious exaltation.] Sure!\nYuh're reg'lar! Yuh'll stick to de finish! Me 'n' you, huh? -- bot'\nmembers of this club! We'll put up one last star bout dat'll knock 'em\noffen deir seats! Dey'll have to make de cages stronger after we're\ntrou! [The gorilla is straining at his bars, growling, hopping from\none foot to the other. YANK takes a jimmy from under his coat and\nforces the lock on the cage door. He throws this open.] Pardon from de\ngovernor! Step out and shake hands! I'll take yuh for a walk down Fif'\nAvenoo. We'll knock 'em offen de oith and croak wit de band playin'.\nCome on, Brother. [The gorilla scrambles gingerly out of his cage.\nGoes to YANK and stands looking at him. YANK keeps his mocking\ntone -- holds out his hand.] Shake -- de secret grip of our order.\n[Something, the tone of mockery, perhaps, suddenly enrages the animal.\nWith a spring he wraps his huge arms around YANK in a murderous hug.\nThere is a crackling snap of crushed ribs -- a gasping cry, still\nmocking, from YANK.] Hey, I didn't say, kiss me. [The gorilla lets\nthe crushed body slip to the floor; stands over it uncertainly,\nconsidering; then picks it up, throws it in the cage, shuts the door,\nand shuffles off menacingly into the darkness at left. A great uproar\nof frightened chattering and whimpering comes from the other cages.\nThen YANK moves, groaning, opening his eyes, and there is silence. He\nmutters painfully.] Say -- dey oughter match him -- wit Zybszko. He got\nme, aw right. I'm trou. Even him didn't tink I belonged. [Then, with\nsudden passionate despair.] Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I\nfit in? [Checking himself as suddenly.] Aw, what de hell! No\nsquakin', see! No quittin', get me! Croak wit your boots on! [He grabs\nhold of the bars of the cage and hauls himself painfully to his\nfeet -- looks around him bewilderedly -- forces a mocking laugh.] In de\ncage, huh? [In the strident tones of a circus barker.] Ladies and\ngents, step forward and take a slant at de one and only -- [His voice\nweakening] -- one and original -- Hairy Ape from de wilds of -- [He slips\nin a heap on the floor and dies. The monkeys set up a chattering,\nwhimpering wail. And, perhaps, the Hairy Ape at last belongs.]",
