                "I. LIFE OF SAINT MAEL",
                "Mael, a scion of a royal family of Cambria, was sent in his ninth year to\n      the Abbey of Yvern so that he might there study both sacred and profane\n      learning. At the age of fourteen he renounced his patrimony and took a vow\n      to serve the Lord. His time was divided, according to the rule, between\n      the singing of hymns, the study of grammar, and the meditation of eternal\n      truths.",
                "A celestial perfume soon disclosed the virtues of the monk throughout the\n      cloister, and when the blessed Gal, the Abbot of Yvern, departed from this\n      world into the next, young Mael succeeded him in the government of the\n      monastery. He established therein a school, an infirmary, a guest-house, a\n      forge, work-shops of all kinds, and sheds for building ships, and he\n      compelled the monks to till the lands in the neighbourhood. With his own\n      hands he cultivated the garden of the Abbey, he worked in metals, he\n      instructed the novices, and his life was gently gliding along like a\n      stream that reflects the heaven and fertilizes the fields.",
                "At the close of the day this servant of God was accustomed to seat himself\n      on the cliff, in the place that is to-day still called St. Mael's chair.\n      At his feet the rocks bristling with green seaweed and tawny wrack seemed\n      like black dragons as they faced the foam of the waves with their\n      monstrous breasts. He watched the sun descending into the ocean like a red\n      Host whose glorious blood gave a purple tone to the clouds and to the\n      summits of the waves. And the holy man saw in this the image of the\n      mystery of the Cross, by which the divine blood has clothed the earth with\n      a royal purple. In the offing a line of dark blue marked the shores of the\n      island of Gad, where St. Bridget, who had been given the veil by St. Malo,\n      ruled over a convent of women.",
                "Now Bridget, knowing the merits of the venerable Mael, begged from him\n      some work of his hands as a rich present. Mael cast a hand-bell of bronze\n      for her and, when it was finished, he blessed it and threw it into the\n      sea. And the bell went ringing towards the coast of Gad, where St.\n      Bridget, warned by the sound of the bell upon the waves, received it\n      piously, and carried it in solemn procession with singing of psalms into\n      the chapel of the convent.",
                "Thus the holy Mael advanced from virtue to virtue. He had already passed\n      through two-thirds of the way of life, and he hoped peacefully to reach\n      his terrestrial end in the midst of his spiritual brethren, when he knew\n      by a certain sign that the Divine wisdom had decided otherwise, and that\n      the Lord was calling him to less peaceful but not less meritorious\n      labours."

                "II. THE APOSTOLICAL VOCATION OF SAINT MAEL",
                "One day as he walked in meditation to the furthest point of a tranquil\n      beach, for which rocks jutting out into the sea formed a rugged dam, he\n      saw a trough of stone which floated like a boat upon the waters.",
                "It was in a vessel similar to this that St. Guirec, the great St. Columba,\n      and so many holy men from Scotland and from Ireland had gone forth to\n      evangelize Armorica. More recently still, St. Avoye having come from\n      England, ascended the river Auray in a mortar made of rose-coloured\n      granite into which children were afterwards placed in order to make them\n      strong; St. Vouga passed from Hibernia to Cornwall on a rock whose\n      fragments, preserved at Penmarch, will cure of fever such pilgrims as\n      place these splinters on their heads. St. Samson entered the Bay of St.\n      Michael's Mount in a granite vessel which will one day be called St.\n      Samson's basin. It is because of these facts that when he saw the stone\n      trough the holy Mael understood that the Lord intended him for the\n      apostolate of the pagans who still peopled the coast and the Breton\n      islands.",
                "He handed his ashen staff to the holy Budoc, thus investing him with the\n      government of the monastery. Then, furnished with bread, a barrel of fresh\n      water, and the book of the Holy Gospels, he entered the stone trough which\n      carried him gently to the island of Hoedic.",
                "This island is perpetually buffeted by the winds. In it some poor men\n      fished among the clefts of the rocks and labouriously cultivated\n      vegetables in gardens full of sand and pebbles that were sheltered from\n      the wind by walls of barren stone and hedges of tamarisk. A beautiful\n      fig-tree raised itself in a hollow of the island and thrust forth its\n      branches far and wide. The inhabitants of the island used to worship it.",
                "And the holy Mael said to them: \"You worship this tree because it is\n      beautiful. Therefore you are capable of feeling beauty. Now I come to\n      reveal to you the hidden beauty.\" And he taught them the Gospel. And after\n      having instructed them, he baptized them with salt and water.",
                "The islands of Morbihan were more numerous in those times than they are\n      to-day. For since then many have been swallowed up by the sea. St. Mael\n      evangelized sixty of them. Then in his granite trough he ascended the\n      river Auray. And after sailing for three hours he landed before a Roman\n      house. A thin column of smoke went up from the roof. The holy man crossed\n      the threshold on which there was a mosaic representing a dog with its hind\n      legs outstretched and its lips drawn back. He was welcomed by an old\n      couple, Marcus Combabus and Valeria Moerens, who lived there on the\n      products of their lands. There was a portico round the interior court the\n      columns of which were painted red, half their height upwards from the\n      base. A fountain made of shells stood against the wall and under the\n      portico there rose an altar with a niche in which the master of the house\n      had placed some little idols made of baked earth and whitened with\n      whitewash. Some represented winged children, others Apollo or Mercury, and\n      several were in the form of a naked woman twisting her hair. But the holy\n      Mael, observing those figures, discovered among them the image of a young\n      mother holding a child upon her knees.",
                "Immediately pointing to that image he said:",
                "\"That is the Virgin, the mother of God. The poet Virgil foretold her in\n      Sibylline verses before she was born and, in angelical tones he sang Jam\n      redit et virgo. Throughout heathendom prophetic figures of her have been\n      made, like that which you, O Marcus, have placed upon this altar. And\n      without doubt it is she who has protected your modest household. Thus it\n      is that those who faithfully observe the natural law prepare themselves\n      for the knowledge of revealed truths.\"",
                "Marcus Combabus and Valeria Moerens, having been instructed by this\n      speech, were converted to the Christian faith. They received baptism\n      together with their young freedwoman, Caelia Avitella, who was dearer to\n      them than the light of their eyes. All their tenants renounced paganism\n      and were baptized on the same day.",
                "Marcus Combabus, Valeria Moerens, and Caelia Avitella led thenceforth a\n      life full of merit. They died in the Lord and were admitted into the canon\n      of the saints.",
                "For thirty-seven years longer the blessed Mael evangelized the pagans of\n      the inner lands. He built two hundred and eighteen chapels and\n      seventy-four abbeys.",
                "Now on a certain day in the city of Vannes, when he was preaching the\n      Gospel, he learned that the monks of Yvern had in his absence declined\n      from the rule of St. Gal. Immediately, with the zeal of a hen who gathers\n      her brood, he repaired to his erring children. He was then towards the end\n      of his ninety-seventh year; his figure was bent, but his arms were still\n      strong, and his speech was poured forth abundantly like winter snow in the\n      depths of the valleys.",
                "Abbot Budoc restored the ashen staff to St. Mael and informed him of the\n      unhappy state into which the Abbey had fallen. The monks were in\n      disagreement as to the date an which the festival of Easter ought to be\n      celebrated. Some held for the Roman calendar, others for the Greek\n      calendar, and the horrors of a chronological schism distracted the\n      monastery.",
                "There also prevailed another cause of disorder. The nuns of the island of\n      Gad, sadly fallen from their former virtue, continually came in boats to\n      the coast of Yvern. The monks received them in the guesthouse and from\n      this there arose scandals which filled pious souls with desolation.",
                "Having finished his faithful report, Abbot Budoc concluded in these terms:",
                "\"Since the coming of these nuns the innocence and peace of the monks are\n      at an end.\"",
                "\"I readily believe it,\" answered the blessed Mael. \"For woman is a\n      cleverly constructed snare by which we are taken even before we suspect\n      the trap. Alas! the delightful attraction of these creatures is exerted\n      with even greater force from a distance than when they are close at hand.\n      The less they satisfy desire the more they inspire it. This is the reason\n      why a poet wrote this verse to one of them:",
                "'When present I avoid thee, but when away I find thee.'",
                "\"Thus we see, my son, that the blandishments of carnal love have more\n      power over hermits and monks than over men who live in the world. All\n      through my life the demon of lust has tempted me in various ways, but his\n      strongest temptations did not come to me from meeting a woman, however\n      beautiful and fragrant she was. They came to me from the image of an\n      absent woman. Even now, though full of days and approaching my\n      ninety-eighth year, I am often led by the Enemy to sin against chastity,\n      at least in thought. At night when I am cold in my bed and my frozen old\n      bones rattle together with a dull sound I hear voices reciting the second\n      verse of the third Book of the Kings: 'Wherefore his servants said unto\n      him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her\n      stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy\n      bosom, that my lord the king may get heat,' and the devil shows me a girl\n      in the bloom of youth who says to me: 'I am thy Abishag; I am thy\n      Shunamite. Make, O my lord, room for me in thy couch.'",
                "\"Believe me,\" added the old man, \"it is only by the special aid of Heaven\n      that a monk can keep his chastity in act and in intention.\"",
                "Applying himself immediately to restore innocence and peace to the\n      monastery, he corrected the calendar according to the calculations of\n      chronology and astronomy and he compelled all the monks to accept his\n      decision; he sent the women who had declined from St. Bridget's rule back\n      to their convent; but far from driving them away brutally, he caused them\n      to be led to their boat with singing of psalms and litanies.",
                "\"Let us respect in them,\" he said, \"the daughters of Bridget and the\n      betrothed of the Lord. Let us beware lest we imitate the Pharisees who\n      affect to despise sinners. The sin of these women and not their persons\n      should be abased, and they should be made ashamed of what they have done\n      and not of what they are, for they are all creatures of God.\"",
                "And the holy man exhorted his monks to obey faithfully the rule of their\n      order.",
                "\"When it does not yield to the rudder,\" said he to them, \"the ship yields\n      to the rock.\""

                "The blessed Mael had scarcely restored order in the Abbey of Yvern before\n      he learned that the inhabitants of the island of Hoedic, his first\n      catechumens and the dearest of all to his heart, had returned to paganism,\n      and that they were hanging crowns of flowers and fillets of wool to the\n      branches of the sacred fig-tree.",
                "The boatman who brought this sad news expressed a fear that soon those\n      misguided men might violently destroy the chapel that had been built on\n      the shore of their island.",
                "The holy man resolved forthwith to visit his faithless children, so that\n      he might lead them back to the faith and prevent them from yielding to\n      such sacrilege. As he went down to the bay where his stone trough was\n      moored, he turned his eyes to the sheds, then filled with the noise of\n      saws and of hammers, which, thirty years before, he had erected on the\n      fringe of that bay for the purpose of building ships.",
                "At that moment, the Devil, who never tires, went out from the sheds and,\n      under the appearance of a monk called Samsok, he approached the holy man\n      and tempted him thus:",
                "\"Father, the inhabitants of the island of Hoedic commit sins unceasingly.\n      Every moment that passes removes them farther from God. They are soon\n      going to use violence towards the chapel that you have raised with your\n      own venerable hands on the shore of their island. Time is pressing. Do you\n      not think that your stone trough would carry you more quickly towards them\n      if it were rigged like a boat and furnished with a rudder, a mast, and a\n      sail, for then you would be driven by the wind? Your arms are still strong\n      and able to steer a small craft. It would be a good thing, too, to put a\n      sharp stem in front of your apostolic trough. You are much too\n      clear-sighted not to have thought of it already.\"",
                "\"Truly time is pressing,\" answered the holy man. \"But to do as you say,\n      Samson, my son, would it not be to make myself like those men of little\n      faith who do not trust the Lord? Would it not be to despise the gifts of\n      Him who has sent me this stone vessel without rigging or sail?\"",
                "This question, the Devil, who is a great theologian, answered by another.",
                "\"Father, is it praiseworthy to wait, with our arms folded, until help\n      comes from on high, and to ask everything from Him who can do all things,\n      instead of acting by human prudence and helping ourselves?",
                "\"It certainly is not,\" answered the holy Mael, \"and to neglect to act by\n      human prudence is tempting God.\"",
                "\"Well,\" urged the Devil, \"is it not prudence in this case to rig the\n      vessel?\"",

                "\"It is, father. A granite trough that floats on the water like a cork is a\n      miraculous trough. There is not the slightest doubt about it. What\n      conclusion do you draw from that?\"",
                "\"I am greatly perplexed. Is it right to perfect so miraculous a machine by\n      human and natural means?\"",
                "\"Father, if you lost your right foot and God restored it to you, would not\n      that foot be miraculous?\"",
                "\"Without doubt, my son.\"",
                "\"Would you put a shoe on it?\"",

That is clear. Alas! Why must the holiest persons have\n      their moments of weakness and despondency? The most illustrious of the\n      apostles of Brittany could accomplish works worthy of eternal glory . . .\n      But his spirit is tardy and his hand is slothful. Farewell then, father!\n      Travel by short and slow stages and when at last you approach the coast of\n      Hoedic you will see the smoking ruins of the chapel that was built and\n      consecrated by your own hands. The pagans will have burned it and with it\n      the deacon you left there. He will be as thoroughly roasted as a black\n      pudding.\"",
                "\"My trouble is extreme,\" said the servant of God, drying with his sleeve\n      the sweat that gathered upon his brow. \"But tell me, Samson, my son, would\n      not rigging this stone trough be a difficult piece of work? And if we\n      undertook it might we not lose time instead of gaining it?\"",

We shall find the necessary rigging in this shed that\n      you have formerly built here on the coast and in those store-houses\n      abundantly stocked through your care.

The old man steered to the south so as to double\n      the Land's End, but an irresistible current carried him to the south-west.\n      He went along the southern coast of Ireland and turned sharply towards the\n      north. In the evening the wind freshened. In vain did Mael attempt to furl\n      the sail. The vessel flew distractedly towards the fabulous seas.",
                "By the light of the moon the immodest sirens of the North came around him\n      with their hempen-coloured hair, raising their white throats and their\n      rose-tinted limbs out of the sea; and beating the water into foam with\n      their emerald tails, they sang in cadence:",

                "For a moment their harmonious laughter followed him beneath the stars, but\n      the vessel fled on, a hundred times more swiftly than the red ship of a\n      Viking. And the petrels, surprised in their flight, clung with their feet\n      to the hair of the holy man.",
                "Soon a tempest arose full of darkness and groanings, and the trough,\n      driven by a furious wind, flew like a sea-mew through the mist and the\n      surge.",
                "After a night of three times twenty-four hours the darkness was suddenly\n      rent and the holy man discovered on the horizon a shore more dazzling than\n      diamond. The coast rapidly grew larger, and soon by the glacial light of a\n      torpid and sunken sun, Mael saw, rising above the waves, the silent\n      streets of a white city, which, vaster than Thebes with its hundred gates,\n      extended as far as the eye could see the ruins of its forum built of snow,\n      its palaces of frost, its crystal arches, and its iridescent obelisks.",
                "The ocean was covered with floating ice-bergs around which swam men of the\n      sea of a wild yet gentle appearance. And Leviathan passed by hurling a\n      column of water up to the clouds.",
                "Moreover, on a block of ice which floated at the same rate as the stone\n      trough there was seated a white bear holding her little one in her arms,\n      and Mael heard her murmuring in a low voice this verse of Virgil, Incipe\n      parve puer.",
                "And full of sadness and trouble, the old man wept.",
                "The fresh water had frozen and burst the barrel that contained it. And\n      Mael was sucking pieces of ice to quench his thirst, and his food was\n      bread dipped in dirty water. His beard and his hair were broken like\n      glass. His habit was covered with a layer of ice and cut into him at every\n      movement of his limbs. Huge waves rose up and opened their foaming jaws at\n      the old man. Twenty times the boat was filled by masses of sea. And the\n      ocean swallowed up the book of the Holy Gospels which the apostle guarded\n      with extreme care in a purple cover marked with a golden cross.",
                "Now on the thirtieth day the sea calmed. And lo! with a frightful clamour\n      of sky and waters a mountain of dazzling whiteness advanced towards the\n      stone vessel. Mael steered to avoid it, but the tiller broke in his hands.\n      To lessen the speed of his progress towards the rock he attempted to reef\n      the sails, but when he tried to knot the reef-points the wind pulled them\n      away from him and the rope seared his hands. He saw three demons with\n      wings of black skin having hooks at their ends, who, hanging from the\n      rigging, were puffing with their breath against the sails.",
                "Understanding from this sight that the Enemy had governed him in all these\n      things, he guarded himself by making the sign of the Cross. Immediately a\n      furious gust of wind filled with the noise of sobs and howls struck the\n      stone trough, carried off the mast with all the sails, and tore away the\n      rudder and the stem.",

                "\"What relation do you claim to establish between the baptism of a bird and\n      the marriage of a eunuch? There is none at all. Marriage is, if I may say\n      so, a conditional, a contingent sacrament. The priest blesses an event\n      beforehand; it is evident that if the act is not consummated the\n      benediction remains without effect. That is obvious. I have known on\n      earth, in the town of Antrim, a rich man named Sadoc, who, living in\n      concubinage with a woman, caused her to be the mother of nine children. In\n      his old age, yielding to my reproofs, he consented to marry her, and I\n      blessed their union. Unfortunately Sadoc's great age prevented him from\n      consummating the marriage. A short time afterwards he lost all his\n      property, and Germaine (that was the name of the woman), not feeling\n      herself able to endure poverty, asked for the annulment of a marriage\n      which was no reality. The Pope granted her request, for it was just. So\n      much for marriage. But baptism is conferred without restrictions or\n      reserves of any kind. There is no doubt about it, what the penguins have\n      received is a sacrament.\"",
                "Called to give his opinion, Pope St. Damascus expressed himself in these\n      terms:",

In truth, the sanctifying virtue of this sacrament\n      results from the exterior act by which it is conferred, without the\n      baptized person cooperating in his own sanctification by any personal act;\n      if it were otherwise it would not be administered to the newly born. And\n      there is no need, in order to baptize, to fulfil any special condition; it\n      is not necessary to be in a state of grace; it is sufficient to have the\n      intention of doing what the Church does, to pronounce the consecrated\n      words and to observe the prescribed forms. Now we cannot doubt that the\n      venerable Mael has observed these conditions. Therefore the penguins are\n      baptized.\"",
                "\"Do you think so?\" asked St. Guenole. \"And what then do you believe that\n      baptism really is? Baptism is the process of regeneration by which man is\n      born of water and of the spirit, for having entered the water covered with\n      crimes, he goes out of it a neophyte, a new creature, abounding in the\n      fruits of righteousness; baptism is the seed of immortality; baptism is\n      the pledge of the resurrection; baptism is the burying with Christ in His\n      death and participation in His departure from the sepulchre. That is not a\n      gift to bestow upon birds. Reverend Fathers, let us consider. Baptism\n      washes away original sin; now the penguins were not conceived in sin. It\n      removes the penalty of sin; now the penguins have not sinned. It produces\n      grace and the gift of virtues, uniting Christians to Jesus Christ, as the\n      members to the body, and it is obvious to the senses that penguins cannot\n      acquire the virtues of confessors, of virgins, and of widows, or receive\n      grace and be united to -- \"",
                "St. Damascus did not allow him to finish.",
                "\"That proves,\" said he warmly, \"that the baptism was useless; it does not\n      prove that it was not effective.\"",
                "\"But by this reasoning,\" said St. Guenole, \"one might baptize in the name\n      of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by aspersion or\n      immersion, not only a bird or a quadruped, but also an inanimate object, a\n      statue, a table, a chair, etc. That animal would be Christian, that idol,\n      that table would be Christian! It is absurd!\"",
                "St. Augustine began to speak. There was a great silence.",
                "\"I am going,\" said the ardent bishop of Hippo, \"to show you, by an\n      example, the power of formulas. It deals, it is true, with a diabolical\n      operation. But if it be established that formulas taught by the Devil have\n      effect upon unintelligent animals or even on inanimate objects, how can we\n      longer doubt that the effect of the sacramental formulas extends to the\n      minds of beasts and even to inert matter?",
                "\"This is the example. There was during my lifetime in the town of Madaura,\n      the birthplace of the philosopher Apuleius, a witch who was able to\n      attract men to her chamber by burning a few of their hairs along with\n      certain herbs upon her tripod, pronouncing at the same time certain words.\n      Now one day when she wished by this means to gain the love of a young man,\n      she was deceived by her maid, and instead of the young man's hairs, she\n      burned some hairs pulled from a leather bottle, made out of a goatskin\n      that hung in a tavern. During the night the leather bottle, full of wine,\n      capered through the town up to the witch's door. This fact is undoubted.\n      And in sacraments as in enchantments it is the form which operates. The\n      effect of a divine formula cannot be less in power and extent than the\n      effect of an infernal formula.\"",
                "Having spoken in this fashion the great St. Augustine sat down amidst\n      applause.",
                "One of the blessed, of an advanced age and having a melancholy appearance,\n      asked permission to speak. No one knew him. His name was Probus, and he\n      was not enrolled in the canon of the saints.",
                "\"I beg the company's pardon,\" said he, \"I have no halo, and I gained\n      eternal blessedness without any eminent distinction. But after what the\n      great St. Augustine has just told you I believe it right to impart a cruel\n      experience, which I had, relative to the conditions necessary for the\n      validity of a sacrament. The bishop of Hippo is indeed right in what he\n      said. A sacrament depends on the form; its virtue is in its form; its vice\n      is in its form. Listen, confessors and pontiffs, to my woeful story. I was\n      a priest in Rome under the rule of the Emperor Gordianus. Without desiring\n      to recommend myself to you for any special merit, I may say that I\n      exercised my priesthood with piety and zeal. For forty years I served the\n      church of St. Modestus-beyond-the-Walls. My habits were regular. Every\n      Saturday I went to a tavern-keeper called Barjas, who dwelt with his\n      wine-jars under the Porta Capena, and from him I bought the wine that I\n      consecrated daily throughout the week. During that long space of time I\n      never failed for a single morning to consecrate the holy sacrifice of the\n      mass. However, I had no joy, and it was with a heart oppressed by sorrow\n      that, on the steps of the altar I used to ask, 'Why art thou so heavy, O\n      my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me?' The faithful whom I\n      invited to the holy table gave me cause for affliction, for having, so to\n      speak, the Host that I administered still upon their tongues, they fell\n      again into sin just as if the sacrament had been without power or\n      efficacy. At last I reached the end of my earthly trials, and failing\n      asleep in the Lord, I awoke in this abode of the elect. I learned then\n      from the mouth of the angel who brought me here, that Barjas, the\n      tavern-keeper of the Porta Capena, had sold for wine a decoction of roots\n      and barks in which there was not a single drop of the juice of the grape.\n      I had been unable to transmute this vile brew into blood, for it was not\n      wine, and wine alone is changed into the blood of Jesus Christ. Therefore\n      all my consecrations were invalid, and unknown to us, my faithful and\n      myself had for forty years been deprived of the sacrament and were in fact\n      in a state of excommunication. This revelation threw me into a stupor\n      which overwhelms me even to-day in this abode of bliss. I go all through\n      Paradise without ever meeting a single one of those Christians whom\n      formerly I admitted to the holy table in the basilica of the blessed\n      Modestus. Deprived of the bread of angels, they easily gave way to the\n      most abominable vices, and they have all gone to hell. It gives me some\n      satisfaction to think that Barjas, the tavern-keeper, is damned. There is\n      in these things a logic worthy of the author of all logic. Nevertheless my\n      unhappy example proves that it is sometimes inconvenient that form should\n      prevail over essence in the sacraments, and I humbly ask, Could not,\n      eternal wisdom remedy this?\"",
                "\"No,\" answered the Lord. \"The remedy would be worse than the disease. It\n      would be the ruin of the priesthood if essence prevailed over form in the\n      laws of salvation.\"",
                "\"Alas! Lord,\" sighed the humble Probus. \"Be persuaded by my humble\n      experience; as long as you reduce your sacraments to formulas your justice\n      will meet with terrible obstacles.\"",
                "\"I know that better than you do,\" replied the Lord. \"I see in a single\n      glance both the actual problems which are difficult, and the future\n      problems which will not be less difficult. Thus I can foretell that when\n      the sun will have turned round the earth two hundred and forty times more.",
                "\"Sublime language,\" exclaimed the angels.",
                "\"And worthy of the creator of the world,\" answered the pontiffs.",
                "\"It is,\" resumed the Lord, \"a manner of speaking in accordance with my old\n      cosmogony and one which I cannot give up without losing my immutability. .\n      . .",
                "\"After the sun, then, will have turned another two hundred and forty times\n      round the earth, there will not be a single cleric left in Rome who knows\n      Latin. When they sing their litanies in the churches people will invoke\n      Orichel, Roguel, and Totichel, and, as you know, these are devils and not\n      angels. Many robbers desiring to make their communions, but fearing that\n      before obtaining pardon they would be forced to give up the things they\n      had robbed to the Church, will make their confessions to travelling\n      priests, who, ignorant of both Italian and Latin, and only speaking the\n      patois of their village, will go through cities and towns selling the\n      remission of sins for a base price, often for a bottle of wine. Probably\n      we shall not be inconvenienced by those absolutions as they will want\n      contrition to make them valid, but it may be that their baptisms will\n      cause us some embarrassment. The priests will become so ignorant that they\n      will baptize children in nomine patria et filia et spirita sancta, as\n      Louis de Potter will take a pleasure in relating in the third volume of\n      his 'Philosophical, Political, and Critical History of Christianity.' It\n      will be an arduous question to decide on the validity of such baptisms;\n      for even if in my sacred writings I tolerate a Greek less elegant than\n      Plato's and a scarcely Ciceronian Latin, I cannot possibly admit a piece\n      of pure patois as a liturgical formula. And one shudders when one thinks\n      that millions of new-born babes will be baptized by this method. But let\n      us return to our penguins.\"",
                "\"Your divine words, Lord, have already led us back to them,\" said St. Gal.\n      \"In the signs of religion and the laws of salvation form necessarily\n      prevails over essence, and the validity of a sacrament solely depends upon\n      its form.

How can they succeed? The habits of birds are, in\n      many points, contrary to the commandments of the Church, and the penguins\n      have no reason for changing theirs. I mean that they are not intelligent\n      enough to give up their present habits and assume better.\"",

I\n      shall only remark to the doctors, confessors, and pontiffs gathered in\n      this assembly that the separation between man and animal is not complete\n      since there are monsters who proceed from both. Such are chimeras -- half\n      nymphs and half serpents; such are the three Gorgons and the Capripeds;\n      such are the Scyllas and the Sirens who sing in the sea. These have a\n      woman's breast and a fish's tail. Such also are the Centaurs, men down to\n      the waist and the remainder horses. They are a noble race of monsters. One\n      of them, as you know, was able, guided by the light of reason alone, to\n      direct his steps towards eternal blessedness, and you sometimes see his\n      heroic bosom prancing on the clouds. Chiron, the Centaur, deserved for his\n      works on the earth to share the abode of the blessed; he it was who gave\n      Achilles his education; and that young hero, when he left the Centaur's\n      hands, lived for two years, dressed as a young girl, among the daughters\n      of King Lycomedes. He shared their games and their bed without allowing\n      any suspicion to arise that he was not a young virgin like them. Chiron,\n      who taught him such good morals, is, with the Emperor Trajan, the only\n      righteous man who obtained celestial glory by following the law of nature.\n      And yet he was but half human.",
                "\"I think I have proved by this example that, to reach eternal blessedness,\n      it is enough to possess some parts of humanity, always on the condition\n      that they are noble. And what Chiron, the Centaur, could obtain without\n      having been regenerated by baptism, would not the penguins deserve too, if\n      they became half penguins and half men? That is why, Lord, I entreat you\n      to give old Mael's penguins a human head and breast so that they can\n      praise you worthily. And grant them also an immortal soul -- but one of\n      small size.\"",

The clamour of the\n      monsters prevented me from listening to the teaching of the Abbot St.\n      Paul, and we ate birds' dung with our bread and lettuces.

But do you not think, father, that it would\n      be better to leave them naked? Why clothe them? When they wear clothes and\n      are under the moral law they will assume an immense pride, a vile\n      hypocrisy, and an excessive cruelty.\"",

                "\"The moral law,\" answered Magis, \"forces men who are beasts to live\n      otherwise than beasts, a thine that doubtless puts a constraint upon them,\n      but that also flatters and reassures them; and as they are proud,\n      cowardly, and covetous of pleasure, they willingly submit to restraints\n      that tickle their vanity and on which they found both their present\n      security and the hope of their future happiness. That is the principle of\n      all morality. . . . But let us not mislead ourselves. My companions are\n      unloading their cargo of stuffs and skins on the island. Think, father,\n      while there is still time I To clothe the penguins is a very serious\n      business. At present when a penguin desires a penguin he knows precisely\n      what he desires and his lust is limited by an exact knowledge of its\n      object. At this moment two or three couples of penguins are making love on\n      the beach. See with what simplicity! No one pays any attention and the\n      actors themselves do not seem to be greatly preoccupied. But when the\n      female penguins are clothed, the male penguin will not form so exact a\n      notion of what it is that attracts him to them. His indeterminate desires\n      will fly out into all sorts of dreams and illusions; in short, father, he\n      will know love and its mad torments. And all the time the female penguins\n      will cast down their eyes and bite their lips, and take on airs as if they\n      kept a treasure under their clothes! . . . what a pity!",
                "\"The evil will be endurable as long as these people remain rude and poor;\n      but only wait for a thousand years and you will see, father, with what\n      powerful weapons you have endowed the daughters of Alca. If you will allow\n      me, I can give you some idea of it beforehand. I have some old clothes in\n      this chest. Let us take at hazard one of these female penguins to whom the\n      male penguins give such little thought, and let us dress her as well as we\n      can.",

You cannot help seeing, father, that she has narrow shoulders,\n      clumsy breasts, a stout figure, and short legs. Her reddish knees pucker\n      at every step she takes, and there is, at each of her joints, what looks\n      like a little monkey's head. Her broad and sinewy feet cling to the rock\n      with their four crooked toes, while the great toes stick up like the heads\n      of two cunning serpents. She begins to walk, all her muscles are engaged\n      in the task, and, when we see them working, we think of her as a machine\n      intended for walking rather than as a machine intended for making love,\n      although visibly she is both, and contains within herself several other\n      pieces of machinery, besides. Well, venerable apostle, you will see what I\n      am going to make of her.\"",

                "As the penguin tied on her sandals she threw a curious look towards the\n      open coffer, and seeing that it was full of jewels and finery, she smiled\n      through her tears.",
                "The monk twisted her hair on the back of her head and covered it with a\n      chaplet of flowers. He encircled her wrist with golden bracelets and\n      making her stand upright, he passed a large linen band beneath her\n      breasts, alleging that her bosom would thereby derive a new dignity and\n      that her sides would be compressed to the greater glory of her hips.",

                "Magis asked her if she did not think the dress a little long, but she\n      answered with assurance that it was not -- she would hold it up.",
                "Immediately, taking the back of her skirt in her left hand, she drew it\n      obliquely across her hips, taking care to disclose a glimpse of her heels.\n      Then she went away, walking with short steps and swinging her hips.",
                "She did not turn her head, but as she passed near a stream she glanced out\n      of the corner of her eye at her own reflection.",
                "A male penguin, who met her by chance, stopped in surprise, and retracing\n      his steps began to follow her. As she went along the shore, others coming\n      back from fishing, went up to her, and after looking at her, walked behind\n      her. Those who were lying on the sand got up and joined the rest.",
                "Unceasingly, as she advanced, fresh penguins, descending from the paths of\n      the mountain, coming out of clefts of the rocks, and emerging from the\n      water, added to the size of her retinue.",
                "And all of them, men of ripe age with vigorous shoulders and hairy\n      breasts, agile youths, old men shaking the multitudinous wrinkles of their\n      rosy, and white-haired skins, or dragging their legs thinner and drier\n      than the juniper staff that served them as a third leg, hurried on,\n      panting and emitting an acrid odour and hoarse gasps. Yet she went on\n      peacefully and seemed to see nothing.",
                "\"Father,\" cried Magis, \"notice how each one advances with his nose pointed\n      towards the centre of gravity of that young damsel now that the centre is\n      covered by a garment. The sphere inspires the meditations of geometers by\n      the number of its properties. When it proceeds from a physical and living\n      nature it acquires new qualities, and in order that the interest of that\n      figure might be fully revealed to the penguins it was necessary that,\n      ceasing to see it distinctly with their eyes, they should be led to\n      represent it to themselves in their minds. I myself feel at this moment\n      irresistibly attracted towards that penguin. Whether it be because her\n      skirt gives more importance to her hips, and that in its simple\n      magnificence it invests them with a synthetic and general character and\n      allows only the pure idea, the divine principle, of them to be seen,\n      whether this be the cause I cannot say, but I feel that if I embraced her\n      I would hold in my hands the heaven of human pleasure. It is certain that\n      modesty communicates an invincible attraction to women. My uneasiness is\n      so great that it would be vain for me to try to conceal it.\"",
                "He spoke, and, gathering up his habit, he rushed among the crowd of\n      penguins, pushing, jostling, trampling, and crushing, until he reached the\n      daughter of Alca, whom he seized and suddenly carried in his arms into a\n      cave that had been hollowed out by the sea.",
                "Then the penguins felt as if the sun had gone out. And the holy Mael knew\n      that the Devil had taken the features of the monk, Magis, in order that he\n      might give clothes to the daughter of Alca. He was troubled in spirit, and\n      his soul was sad. As with slow steps he went towards his hermitage he saw\n      the little penguins of six and seven years of age tightening their waists\n      with belts made of sea-weed and walking along the shore to see if anybody\n      would follow them."

They were not so beautiful, their shape was\n      uncouth and without art, and no attention was paid to them since every\n      woman bad one. As they prepared the meals and worked in the fields they\n      soon had nothing but slovenly bodices and soiled petticoats.",

They knew nothing of the troubles of the\n      heart and the disorders of passion. Their habits were innocent. Incest,\n      though frequent, was a sign of rustic simplicity and if drunkenness led a\n      youth to commit some such crime he thought nothing more about it the day\n      afterwards."

                "The island did not preserve the rugged appearance that it had formerly,\n      when, in the midst of floating icebergs it sheltered a population of birds\n      within its rocky amphitheatre. Its snow-clad peak had sunk down into a\n      hill from the summit of which one could see the coasts of Armorica\n      eternally covered with mist, and the ocean strewn with sullen reefs like\n      monsters half raised out of its depths.",
                "Its coasts were now very extensive and clearly defined and its shape\n      reminded one of a mulberry leaf. It was suddenly covered with coarse\n      grass, pleasing to the flocks, and with willows, ancient figtrees, and\n      mighty oaks. This fact is attested by the Venerable Bede and several other\n      authors worthy of credence.",
                "To the north the shore formed a deep bay that in after years became one of\n      the most famous ports in the universe. To the east, along a rocky coast\n      beaten by a foaming sea, there stretched a deserted and fragrant heath. It\n      was the Beach of Shadows, and the inhabitants of the island never ventured\n      on it for fear of the serpents that lodged in the hollows of the rocks and\n      lest they might encounter the souls of the dead who resembled livid\n      flames. To the south, orchards and woods bounded the languid Bay of\n      Divers. On this fortunate shore old Mael built a wooden church and a\n      monastery. To the west, two streams, the Clange and the Surelle, watered\n      the fertile valleys of Dalles and Dombes.",
                "Now one autumn morning, as the blessed Mael was walking in the valley of\n      Clange in company with a monk of Yvern called Bulloch, he saw bands of\n      fierce-looking men loaded with stones passing along the roads. At the same\n      time he heard in all directions cries and complaints mounting up from the\n      valley towards the tranquil sky.",
                "And he said to Bulloch:",
                "\"I notice with sadness, my son, that since they became men the inhabitants\n      of this island act with less wisdom than formerly. When they were birds\n      they only quarrelled during the season of their love affairs. But now they\n      dispute all the time; they pick quarrels with each other in summer as well\n      as in winter. How greatly have they fallen from that peaceful majesty\n      which made the assembly of the penguins look like the Senate of a wise\n      republic!",
                "\"Look towards Surelle, Bulloch, my son. In yonder pleasant valley a dozen\n      men penguins are busy knocking each other down with the spades and picks\n      that they might employ better in tilling the ground. The women, still more\n      cruel than the men, are tearing their opponents' faces with their nails.\n      Alas! Bulloch, my son, why are they murdering each other in this way?\"",
                "\"From a spirit of fellowship, father, and through forethought for the\n      future,\" answered Bulloch. \"For man is essentially provident and sociable.\n      Such is his character and it is impossible to imagine it apart from a\n      certain appropriation of things. Those penguins whom you see are dividing\n      the ground among themselves.\"",
                "\"Could they not divide it with less violence?\" asked the aged man. \"As\n      they fight they exchange invectives and threats. I do not distinguish\n      their words, but they are angry ones, judging from the tone.\"",
                "\"They are accusing one another of theft and encroachment,\" answered\n      Bulloch. \"That is the general sense of their speech.\"",
                "At that moment the holy Mael clasped his hands and sighed deeply.",
                "\"Do you see, my son,\" he exclaimed, \"that madman who with his teeth is\n      biting the nose of the adversary he has overthrown and that other one who\n      is pounding a woman's head with a huge stone?\"",
                "\"I see them,\" said Bulloch. \"They are creating law; they are founding\n      property; they are establishing the principles of civilization, the basis\n      of society, and the foundations of the State.\"",
                "\"How is that?\" asked old Mael.",

                "Whilst the monk, Bulloch, was pronouncing these words a big penguin with a\n      fair skin and red hair went down into the valley carrying a trunk of a\n      tree upon his shoulder. He went up to a little penguin who was watering\n      his vegetables in the heat of the sun, and shouted to him:",
                "\"Your field is mine!\"",
                "And having delivered himself of this stout utterance he brought down his\n      club on the head of the little penguin, who fell dead upon the field that\n      his own hands had tilled.",
                "At this sight the holy Mael shuddered through his whole body and poured\n      forth a flood of tears.",
                "And in a voice stifled by horror and fear he addressed this prayer to\n      heaven:",
                "\"O Lord, my God, O thou who didst receive young Abel's sacrifices, thou\n      who didst curse Cain, avenge, O Lord, this innocent penguin sacrificed\n      upon his own field and make the murderer feel the weight of thy arm. Is\n      there a more odious crime, is there a graver offence against thy justice,\n      O Lord, than this murder and this robbery?\"",
                "\"Take care, father,\" said Bulloch gently, \"that what you call murder and\n      robbery may not really be war and conquest, those sacred foundations of\n      empires, those sources of all human virtues and all human greatness.\n      Reflect, above all, that in blaming the big penguin you are attacking\n      property in its origin and in its source. I shall have no trouble in\n      showing you how. To till the land is one thing, to possess it is another,\n      and these two things must not be confused; as regards ownership the right\n      of the first occupier is uncertain and badly founded. The right of\n      conquest, on the other hand, rests on more solid foundations. It is the\n      only right that receives respect since it is the only one that makes\n      itself respected. The sole and proud origin of property is force. It is\n      born and preserved by force. In that it is august and yields only to a\n      greater force. This is why it is correct to say that he who possesses is\n      noble. And that big red man, when he knocked down a labourer to get\n      possession of his field, founded at that moment a very noble house upon\n      this earth. I congratulate him upon it.\"",
                "Having thus spoken, Bulloch approached the big penguin, who was leaning\n      upon his club as he stood in the blood-stained furrow:",
                "\"Lord Greatauk, dreaded Prince,\" said he, bowing to the ground, \"I come to\n      pay you the homage due to the founder of legitimate power and hereditary\n      wealth. The skull of the vile Penguin you have overthrown will, buried in\n      your field, attest for ever the sacred rights of your posterity over this\n      soil that you have ennobled. Blessed be your suns and your sons' sons!\n      They shall be Greatauks, Dukes of Skull, and they shall rule over this\n      island of Alca.\"",

                "Mael remained silent and motionless, with his eyes raised towards heaven;\n      he felt a painful uncertainty in judging the monk Bulloch's doctrine. It\n      was, however, the doctrine destined to prevail in epochs of advanced\n      civilization. Bulloch can be considered as the creator of civil law in\n      Penguinia."

All the elders\n      of the people are ready, like me, to sacrifice their goods, and no one can\n      doubt their absolute devotion to their country and their creed. We have,\n      then, only to consider the public interest and to do what it requires.\n      Now, Father, what it requires, what it demands, is not to ask much from\n      those who possess much, for then the rich would be less rich and the poor\n      still poorer. The poor live on the wealth of the rich and that is the\n      reason why that wealth is sacred. Do not touch it, to do so would be an\n      uncalled for evil. You will get no great profit by taking from the rich,\n      for they are very few in number; on the contrary you will strip yourself\n      of all your resources and plunge the country into misery. Whereas if you\n      ask a little from each inhabitant without regard to his wealth, you will\n      collect enough for the public necessities and you will have no need to\n      enquire into each citizen's resources, a thing that would be regarded by\n      all as a most vexatious measure. By taxing all equally and easily you will\n      spare the poor, for you Will leave them the wealth of the rich. And how\n      could you possibly proportion taxes to wealth? Yesterday I had two hundred\n      oxen, to-day I have sixty, to-morrow I shall have a hundred. Clunic has\n      three cows, but they are thin; Nicclu has only two, but they are fat.\n      Which is the richer, Clunic or Nicclu? The signs of opulence are\n      deceitful.

He was called Kraken, and had his\n      dwelling on the Beach of Shadows whither the inhabitants never ventured\n      for fear of serpents that lodged in the hollows of the rocks and lest they\n      might encounter the souls of Penguins that had died without baptism.\n      These, in appearance like livid flames, and uttering doleful groans,\n      wandered night and day along the deserted beach. For it was generally\n      believed, though without proof, that among the Penguins that had been\n      changed into men at the blessed Mael's prayer, several had not received\n      baptism and returned after their death to lament amid the tempests. Kraken\n      dwelt on this savage coast in an inaccessible cavern. The only way to it\n      was through a natural tunnel a hundred feet long, the entrance of which\n      was concealed by a thick wood. One evening as Kraken was walking through\n      this deserted plain he happened to meet a young and charming woman\n      Penguin. She was the one that the monk Magis had clothed with his own\n      hands and thus was the first to have worn the garments of chastity. In\n      remembrance of the day when the astonished crowd of Penguins had seen her\n      moving gloriously in her robe tinted like the dawn, this maiden had\n      received the name of Orberosia.*",

He carried off\n      fifty sheep, twelve pigs, and three young boys. Every family was in\n      mourning and the island was full of lamentations. In order to remove the\n      scourge, the Elders of the unfortunate villages watered by the Clange and\n      the Surelle resolved to assemble and together go and ask the help of the\n      blessed Mael.",

Why do you raise towards\n      heaven the smoke of those herbs? What calamity do you expect that I can\n      avert from your heads? Why do you beseech me? I am ready to give my life\n      for you.

But such an occurrence is not unique, for we find in\n      books several tales of very fierce dragons. The monsters are oftenest\n      found in caverns, by the brinks of waters, and, in preference, among pagan\n      peoples. Perhaps there are some among you who, although they have received\n      holy baptism and been incorporated into the family of Abraham, have yet\n      worshipped idols, like the ancient Romans, or hung up images, votive\n      tablets, fillets of wool, and garlands of flowers on the branches of some\n      sacred tree. Or perhaps some of the women Penguins have danced round a\n      magic stone and drunk water from the fountains where the nymphs dwell. If\n      it be so, believe, O Penguins, that the Lord has sent this dragon to\n      punish all for the crimes of some, and to lead you, O children of the\n      Penguins, to exterminate blasphemy, superstition, and impiety from amongst\n      you. For this reason I advise, as a remedy against the great evil from\n      which you suffer, that you carefully search your dwellings for idolatry,\n      and extirpate it from them. I think it would be also efficacious to pray\n      and do penance.\"",

Every night he\n      found his companion more good-humoured and more beautiful, exhaling\n      pleasure and perfuming the nuptial bed with a delicious odour of fennel\n      and vervain.

And in the wooden monastery old Mael, seated on a bench in the\n      shade of an old fig-tree, accompanied by a pious monk called Regimental,\n      kept asking himself anxiously and sadly how it was that there was not in\n      Alca a single virgin fit to overthrow the monster.",

In this\n      respect the story of the dragons of St. Riok and of St. Pol de Leon seems\n      to me particularly instructive. The dragon of St. Riok was six fathoms\n      long; his head was derived from the cock and the basilisk, his body from\n      the ox and the serpent; he ravaged the banks of the Elorn in the time of\n      King Bristocus. St. Riok, then aged two years, led him by a leash to the\n      sea, in which the monster drowned himself of his own accord. St. Pol's\n      dragon was sixty feet long and not less terrible. The blessed apostle of\n      Leon bound him with his stole and allowed a young noble of great purity of\n      life to lead him. These examples prove that in the eyes of God a chaste\n      young man is as agreeable as a chaste girl. Heaven makes no distinction\n      between them. For this reason, my son, if you believe what I say, we will\n      both go to the Coast of Shadows; when we reach the dragon's cavern we will\n      call the monster in a loud voice, and when he comes forth I will tie my\n      stole round his neck and you will lead him to the sea, where he will not\n      fail to drown himself.\"",
                "At the old man's words Samuel cast down his head and did not answer.",

                "\"There is at least cause for some hesitation,\" said he. \"St. Riok was only\n      two years old when he overcame the dragon. Who says that nine or ten years\n      later he could have done as much? Remember, father, that the dragon who is\n      devastating our island has devoured little Elo and four or five other\n      young boys. Brother Samuel is not go presumptuous as to believe that at\n      nineteen years of age he is more innocent than they were at twelve and\n      fourteen.",
                "\"Alas!\" added the monk, with a groan, \"who can boast of being chaste in\n      this world, where everything gives the example and model of love, where\n      all things in nature, animals, and plants, show us the caresses of love\n      and advise us to share them? Animals are eager to unite in their own\n      fashion, but the various marriages of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and\n      reptiles are far from equalling in lust the nuptials of the trees. The\n      greatest extremes of lewdness that the pagans have imagined in their\n      fables are outstripped by the simple flowers of the field, and, if you\n      knew the irregularities of lilies and roses you would take those chalices\n      of impurity, those vases of scandal, away from your altars.\"",
                "\"Do not speak in this way, Brother Regimental,\" answered old Mael. \"Since\n      they are subject to the law of nature, animals and plants are always\n      innocent. They have no souls to save, whilst man -- \"",
                "\"You are right,\" replied Brother Regimental, \"it is quite a different\n      thing. But do not send young Samuel to the dragon -- the dragon might\n      devour him. For the last five years Samuel is not in a state to show his\n      innocence to monsters. In the year of the comet, the Devil in order to\n      seduce him, put in his path a milkmaid, who was lifting up her petticoat\n      to cross a ford. Samuel was tempted, but he overcame the temptation. The\n      Devil, who never tires, sent him the image of that young girl in a dream.\n      The shade did what the reality was unable to accomplish, and Samuel\n      yielded. When he awoke be moistened his couch with his tears, but alas!\n      repentance did not give him back his innocence.\"",
                "As he listened to this story Samuel asked himself how his secret could be\n      known, for he was ignorant that the Devil had borrowed the appearance of\n      Brother Regimental, so as to trouble the hearts of the monks of Alca.",

                "However, the inhabitants of Alca began to take courage. The labourers of\n      Dombes and the neatherds of Belmont swore that they themselves would be of\n      more avail than a girl against the ferocious beast, and they exclaimed as\n      they stroked the muscles on their arms, \"Let the dragon come!\" Many men\n      and women had seen him. They did not agree about his form and his figure,\n      but all now united in saying that he was not as big as they had thought,\n      and that his height was not much greater than a man's. The defence was\n      organised; towards nightfall watches were stationed at the entrances of\n      the villages ready to give the alarm; and during the night companies armed\n      with pitchforks and scythes protected the paddocks in which the animals\n      were shut up. Indeed, once in the village of Anis some plucky labourers\n      surprised him as he was scaling Morio's wall, and, as they had flails,\n      scythes, and pitchforks, they fell upon him and pressed him hard. One of\n      them, a very quick and courageous man, thought to have run him through\n      with his pitchfork; but he slipped in a pool and so let him escape. The\n      others would certainly have caught him had they not waited to pick up the\n      rabbits and fowls that he dropped in his flight.",

I carried away hens and rabbits in my bag; I drove sheep and\n      pigs, cows, and oxen before me. To-day these clod-hoppers keep a good\n      guard; they sit up at night. Just now I was pursued in the village of Anis\n      by doughty labourers armed with flails and scythes and pitchforks. I had\n      to drop the hens and rabbits, put my tail under my arm, and run as fast as\n      I could. Now I ask you, is it seemly for a dragon of Cappadocia to run\n      away like a robber with his tail under his arm? Further, incommoded as I\n      was by crests, horns, hooks, claws, and scales, I barely escaped a brute\n      who ran half an inch of his pitchfork into my left thigh.\"",

To make it more terrible I have put\n      on it the horns of a bull and I have given it a boar's jaws; I have hung\n      from it a horse's tail dyed vermilion. When in the gloomy twilight I threw\n      it over my shoulders no inhabitant of this island had courage to withstand\n      its sight. Women and children, young men and old men fled distracted at\n      its approach, and I carried terror among the whole race of Penguins. By\n      what advice does that insolent people lose its earlier fears and dare\n      to-day to behold these horrible jaws and to attack this terrible crest?\"",

To one extremity of the skeleton Orberosia sewed\n      the fierce crest and the hideous mask that Kraken used to wear in his\n      plundering expeditions, and to the other end she fastened the tail with\n      twisted folds which the hero was wont to trail behind him. And when the\n      work was finished they showed little Elo and the other five children who\n      waited on them how to get inside this machine, how to make it walk, how to\n      blow horns and burn tow in it so as to send forth smoke and flames through\n      the dragon's mouth."

                "II. DRACO THE GREAT (Translation of the Relics of St. Orberosia)",
                "The direct posterity of Brian the Good was extinguished about the year 900\n      in the person of Collic of the Short Nose. A cousin of that prince, Bosco\n      the Magnanimous, succeeded him, and took care, in order to assure himself\n      of the throne, to put to death all his relations. There issued from him a\n      long line of powerful kings.",
                "One of them, Draco the Great, attained great renown as a man of war. He\n      was defeated more frequently than the others. It is by this constancy in\n      defeat that great captains are recognized. In twenty years he burned down\n      more than a hundred thousand hamlets, market towns, unwalled towns,\n      villages, walled towns, cities, and universities. He set fire impartially\n      to his enemies' territory and to his own domains. And he used to explain\n      his conduct by saying:",
                "\"War without fire is like tripe without mustard: it is an insipid thing.\"",
                "His justice was rigorous. When the peasants whom he made prisoners were\n      unable to raise the money for their ransoms he had them hanged from a\n      tree, and if any unhappy woman came to plead for her destitute husband he\n      dragged her by the hair at his horse's tail. He lived like a soldier\n      without effeminacy. It is satisfactory to relate that his manner of life\n      was pure. Not only did he not allow his kingdom to decline from its\n      hereditary glory, but, even in his reverses he valiantly supported the\n      honour of the Penguin people.",
                "Draco the Great caused the relics of St. Orberosia to be transferred to\n      Alca.",
                "The body of the blessed saint had been buried in a grotto on the Coast of\n      Shadows at the end of a scented heath. The first pilgrims who went to\n      visit it were the boys and girls from the neighbouring villages. They used\n      to go there in the evening, by preference in couples, as if their pious\n      desires naturally sought satisfaction in darkness and solitude. They\n      worshipped the saint with a fervent and discreet worship whose mystery\n      they seemed jealously to guard, for they did not like to publish too\n      openly the experiences they felt. But they were heard to murmur one to\n      another words of love, delight, and rapture with which they mingled the\n      name of Orberosia. Some would sigh that there they forgot the world;\n      others would say that they came out of the grotto in peace and calm; the\n      young girls among them used to recall to each other the joy with which\n      they had been filled in it.",
                "Such were the marvels that the virgin of Alca performed in the morning of\n      her glorious eternity; they had the sweetness and indefiniteness of the\n      dawn. Soon the mystery of the grotto spread like a perfume throughout the\n      land; it was a ground of joy and edification for pious souls, and corrupt\n      men endeavoured, though in vain, by falsehood and calumny, to divert the\n      faithful from the springs of grace that flowed from the saint's tomb. The\n      Church took measures so that these graces should not remain reserved for a\n      few children, but should be diffused throughout all Penguin Christianity.\n      Monks took up their quarters in the grotto, they built a monastery, a\n      chapel, and a hostelry on the coast, and pilgrims began to flock thither.",
                "As if strengthened by a longer sojourn in heaven, the blessed Orberosia\n      now performed still greater miracles for those who came to lay their\n      offerings on her tomb. She gave hopes to women who had been hitherto\n      barren, she sent dreams to reassure jealous old men concerning the\n      fidelity of the young wives whom they had suspected without cause, and she\n      protected the country from plagues, murrains, famines, tempests, and\n      dragons of Cappadocia.",
                "But during the troubles that desolated the kingdom in the time of King\n      Collic and his successors, the tomb of St. Orberosia was plundered of its\n      wealth, the monastery burned down, and the monks dispersed. The road that\n      had been so long trodden by devout pilgrims was overgrown with furze and\n      heather, and the blue thistles of the sands. For a hundred years the\n      miraculous tomb had been visited by none save vipers, weasels, and bats,\n      when, one day the saint appeared to a peasant of the neighbourhood,\n      Momordic by name.",
                "\"I am the virgin Orberosia,\" said she to him; \"I have chosen thee to\n      restore my sanctuary. Warn the inhabitants of the country that if they\n      allow my memory to be blotted out, and leave my tomb without honour and\n      wealth, a new dragon will come and devastate Penguinia.\"",
                "Learned churchmen held an inquiry concerning this apparition, and\n      pronounced it genuine, and not diabolical but truly heavenly, and in later\n      years it was remarked that in France, in like circumstances, St. Foy and\n      St. Catherine had acted in the same way and made use of similar language.",
                "The monastery was restored and pilgrims flocked to it anew. The virgin\n      Orberosia worked greater and greater miracles. She cured divers hurtful\n      maladies, particularly club-foot, dropsy, paralysis, and St. Guy's\n      disease. The monks who kept the tomb were enjoying an enviable opulence,\n      when the saint, appearing to King Draco the Great, ordered him to\n      recognise her as the heavenly patron of the kingdom and to transfer her\n      precious remains to the cathedral of Alca.",
                "In consequence, the odoriferous relics of that virgin were carried with\n      great pomp to the metropolitan church and placed in the middle of the\n      choir in a shrine made of gold and enamel and ornamented with precious\n      stones.",
                "The chapter kept a record of the miracles wrought by the blessed\n      Orberosia.",
                "Draco the Great, who had never ceased to defend and exalt the Christian\n      faith, died fulfilled with the most pious sentiments and bequeathed his\n      great possessions to the Church."

                "His son, Chum, who was lame, failed to increase the territory of the\n      Penguins. Bolo, the son of Chum, was assassinated by the palace guards at\n      the age of nine, just as he was ascending the throne. His brother Gun\n      succeeded him. He was only seven years old and allowed himself to be\n      governed by his mother, Queen Crucha.",

But she offers in her person certain\n      singularities that will appear beautiful or uncomely according to the\n      contradictory opinions of men and the varying judgments of the world. She\n      has on her forehead two small horns which she conceals in the abundant\n      folds of her golden hair; one of her eyes is blue and one is black; her\n      neck is bent towards the left side; and, like Alexander of Macedon, she\n      has six fingers on her right hand, and a stain like a little monkey's head\n      upon her skin.",
                "\"Her gait is majestic and her manner affable. She is magnificent in her\n      expenses, but she is not always able to rule desire by reason.",
                "\"One day, having noticed in the palace stables, a young groom of great\n      beauty, she immediately fell violently in love with him, and entrusted to\n      him the command of her armies. What one must praise unreservedly in this\n      great queen is the abundance of gifts that she makes to the churches,\n      monasteries, and chapels in her kingdom, and especially to the holy house\n      of Beargarden, where, by the grace of the Lord, I made my profession in my\n      fourteenth year. She has founded masses for the repose of her soul in such\n      great numbers that every priest in the Penguin Church is, so to speak,\n      transformed into a taper lighted in the sight of heaven to draw down the\n      divine mercy upon the august Crucha.\"",
                "From these lines and from some others with which have enriched my text the\n      reader can judge of the historical and literary value of the \"Gesta\n      Penguinorum.\" Unhappily, that chronicle suddenly comes suddenly to an end\n      at third year of Draco the Simple, the successor of Gun the Weak. Having\n      reached that point of my history, I deplore the loss of an agreeable and\n      trustworthy guide.",
                "During the two centuries that followed, the Penguins remained plunged in\n      blood-stained disorder. All the arts perished. In the midst of the general\n      ignorance, the monks in the shadow of their cloister devoted themselves to\n      study, and copied the Holy Scriptures with indefatigable zeal. As\n      parchment was scarce, they scraped the writing off old manuscripts in\n      order to transcribe upon them the divine word. Thus throughout the breadth\n      of Penguinia Bibles blossomed forth like roses on a bush.",
                "A monk of the order of St. Benedict, Ermold the Penguin, had himself alone\n      defaced four thousand Greek and Latin manuscripts so as to copy out the\n      Gospel of St. John four thousand times. Thus the masterpieces of ancient\n      poetry and eloquence were destroyed in great numbers. Historians are\n      unanimous in recognising that the Penguin convents were the refuge of\n      learning during the Middle Ages.",
                "Unending wars between the Penguins and the Porpoises filled the close of\n      this period. It is extremely difficult to know the truth concerning these\n      wars, not because accounts are wanting, but because there are so many of\n      them. The Porpoise Chronicles contradict the Penguin Chronicles at every\n      point. And, moreover, the Penguins contradict each other as well as the\n      Porpoises. I have discovered two chronicles that are in agreement, but one\n      has copied from the other. A single fact is certain, namely, that\n      massacres, rapes, conflagrations, and plunder succeeded one another\n      without interruption.",
                "Under the unhappy prince Bosco IX. the kingdom was at the verge of ruin.\n      On the news that the Porpoise fleet, composed of six hundred great ships,\n      was in sight of Alca, the bishop ordered a solemn procession. The\n      cathedral chapter, the elected magistrates, the members of Parliament, and\n      the clerics of the University entered the Cathedral and, taking up St.\n      Orberosia's shrine, led it in procession through the town, followed by the\n      entire people singing hymns. The holy patron of Penguinia was not invoked\n      in vain. Nevertheless, the Porpoises besieged the town both by land and\n      sea, took it by assault, and for three days and three nights killed,\n      plundered, violated, and burned, with all the indifference that habit\n      produces.",
                "Our astonishment cannot be too great at the fact that, during those iron\n      ages, the faith was preserved intact among the Penguins. The splendour of\n      the truth in those times illumined all souls that had not been corrupted\n      by sophisms. This is the explanation of the unity of belief. A constant\n      practice of the Church doubtless contributed also to maintain this happy\n      communion of the faithful -- every Penguin who thought differently from\n      the others was immediately burned at the stake."

                "IV. LETTERS: JOHANNES TALPA",
                "During the minority of King Gun, Johannes Talpa, in the monastery of\n      Beargarden, where at the age of fourteen he had made his profession and\n      from which he never departed for a single day throughout his life,\n      composed his celebrated Latin chronicle in twelve books called \"De Gestis\n      Penguinorum.\"",
                "The monastery of Beargarden lifts its high walls on the summit of an\n      inaccessible peak. One sees around it only the blue tops of mountains,\n      divided by the clouds.",
                "When he began to write his \"Gesta Penguinorum,\" Johannes Talpa was already\n      old. The good monk has taken care to tell us this in his book: \"My head\n      has long since lost,\" he says, \"its adornment of fair hair, and my scalp\n      resembles those convex mirrors of metal which the Penguin ladies consult\n      with so much care and zeal. My stature, naturally small, has with years\n      become diminished and bent. My white beard gives warmth to my breast.\"",
                "With a charming simplicity, Talpa informs us of certain circumstances in\n      his life and some features in his character. \"Descended,\" he tells us,\n      \"from a noble family, and destined from childhood for the ecclesiastical\n      state, I was taught grammar and music. I learnt to read under the guidance\n      of a master who was called Amicus, and who would have been better named\n      Inimicus. As I did not easily attain to a knowledge of my letters, he beat\n      me violently with rods so that I can say that he printed the alphabet in\n      strokes upon my back.\"",
                "In another passage Talpa confesses his natural inclination towards\n      pleasure. These are his expressive words: \"In my youth the ardour of my\n      senses was such that in the shadow of the woods I experienced a sensation\n      of boiling in a pot rather than of breathing the fresh air. I fled from\n      women, but in vain, for every object recalled them to me.\"",
                "While he was writing his chronicle, a terrible war, at once foreign and\n      domestic, laid waste the Penguin land. The soldiers of Crucha came to\n      defend the monastery of Beargarden against the Penguin barbarians and\n      established themselves strongly within its walls. In order to render it\n      impregnable they pierced loop-holes through the walls and they took the\n      lead off the church roof to make balls for their slings. At night they\n      lighted huge fires in the courts and cloisters and on them they roasted\n      whole oxen which they spitted upon the ancient pine-trees of the mountain.\n      Sitting around the flames, amid smoke filled with a mingled odour of resin\n      and fat, they broached huge casks of wine and beer. Their songs, their\n      blasphemies, and the noise of their quarrels drowned the sound of the\n      morning bells.",
                "At last the Porpoises, having crossed the defiles, laid siege to the\n      monastery. They were warriors from the North, clad in copper armour. They\n      fastened ladders a hundred and fifty fathoms long to the sides of the\n      cliffs and sometimes in the darkness and storm these broke beneath the\n      weight of men and arms, and bunches of the besiegers were hurled into the\n      ravines and precipices. A prolonged wail would be heard going down into\n      the darkness, and the assault would begin again. The Penguins poured\n      streams of burning wax upon their assailants, which made them blaze like\n      torches. Sixty times the enraged Porpoises attempted to scale the\n      monastery and sixty times they were repulsed.",
                "For six months they had closely invested the monastery, when, on the day\n      of the Epiphany, a shepherd of the valley showed them a hidden path by\n      which they climbed the mountain, penetrated into the vaults of the abbey,\n      ran through the cloisters, the kitchens, the church, the chapter halls,\n      the library, the laundry, the cells, the refectories, and the dormitories,\n      and burned the buildings, killing and violating without distinction of age\n      or sex. The Penguins, awakened unexpectedly, ran to arms, but in the\n      darkness and alarm they struck at one another, whilst the Porpoises with\n      blows of their axes disputed the sacred vessels, the censers, the\n      candlesticks, dalmatics, reliquaries, golden crosses, and precious stones.",
                "The air was filled with an acrid odour of burnt flesh. Groans and\n      death-cries arose in the midst of the flames, and on the edges of the\n      crumbling roofs monks ran in thousands like ants, and fell into the\n      valley. Yet Johannes Talpa kept on writing his Chronicle. The soldiers of\n      Crucha retreated speedily and filled up all the issues from the monastery\n      with pieces of rock so as to shut up the Porpoises in the burning\n      buildings. And to crush the enemy beneath the ruin they employed the\n      trunks of old oaks as battering-rams. The burning timbers fell in with a\n      noise like thunder and the lofty arches of the naves crumbled beneath the\n      shock of these giant trees when moved by six hundred men together. Soon\n      there was left nothing of the rich and extensive abbey but the cell of\n      Johannes Talpa, which, by a marvellous chance, hung from the ruin of a\n      smoking gable. The old chronicler still kept writing.",
                "This admirable intensity of thought may seem excessive in the case of an\n      annalist who applies himself to relate the events of his own time. However\n      abstracted and detached we may be from surrounding things, we nevertheless\n      resent their influence. I have consulted the original manuscript of\n      Johannes Talpa in the National Library, where it is preserved (Monumenta\n      Peng., K. L6., 12390 four). It is a parchment manuscript of 628 leaves.\n      The writing is extremely confused, the letters instead of being in a\n      straight line, stray in all directions and are mingled together in great\n      disorder, or, more correctly speaking, in absolute confusion. They are so\n      badly formed that for the most part it is impossible not merely to say\n      what they are, but even to distinguish them from the splashes of ink with\n      which they are plentifully interspersed. Those inestimable pages bear\n      witness in this way to the troubles amid which they were written. To read\n      them is difficult. On the other hand, the monk of Beargarden's style shows\n      no trace of emotion. The tone of the \"Gesta Penguinorum\" never departs\n      from simplicity. The narration is rapid and of a conciseness that\n      sometimes approaches dryness. The reflections are rare and, as a rule,\n      judicious."

                "The Penguin critics vie with one another in affirming that Penguin art has\n      from its origin been distinguished by a powerful and pleasing originality,\n      and that we may look elsewhere in vain for the qualities of grace and\n      reason that characterise its earliest works. But the Porpoises claim that\n      their artists were undoubtedly the instructors and masters of the\n      Penguins. It is difficult to form an opinion on the matter, because the\n      Penguins, before they began to admire their primitive painters, destroyed\n      all their works.",
                "We cannot be too sorry for this loss. For my own part I feel it cruelly,\n      for I venerate the Penguin antiquities and I adore the primitives. They\n      are delightful. I do not say the are all alike, for that would be untrue,\n      but they have common characters that are found in all schools -- I mean\n      formulas from which they never depart -- and there is besides something\n      finished in their work, for what they know they know well. Luckily we can\n      form a notion of the Penguin primitives from the Italian, Flemish, and\n      Dutch primitives, and from the French primitives, who are superior to all\n      the rest; as M. Gruyer tells us they are more logical, logic being a\n      peculiarly French quality. Even if this is denied it must at least be\n      admitted that to France belongs the credit of having kept primitives when\n      the other nations knew them no longer. The Exhibition of French Primitives\n      at the Pavilion Marsan in 1904 contained several little panels\n      contemporary with the later Valois kings and with Henry IV.",
                "I have made many journeys to see the pictures of the brothers Van Eyck, of\n      Memling, of Roger van der Weyden, of the painter of the death of Mary, of\n      Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and of the old Umbrian masters. It was, however,\n      neither Bruges, nor Cologne, nor Sienna, nor Perugia, that completed my\n      initiation; it was in the little town of Arezzo that I became a conscious\n      adept in primitive painting. That was ten years ago or even longer. At\n      that period of indigence and simplicity, the municipal museums, though\n      usually kept shut, were always opened to foreigners. One evening an old\n      woman with a candle showed me, for half a lira, the sordid museum of\n      Arezzo, and in it I discovered a painting by Margaritone, a \"St. Francis,\"\n       the pious sadness of which moved me to tears. I was deeply touched, and\n      Margaritone, of Arezzo became from that day my dearest primitive.",
                "I picture to myself the Penguin primitives in conformity with the works of\n      that master. It will not therefore be thought superfluous if in this place\n      I consider his works with some attention, if not in detail, at least under\n      their more general and, if I dare say so, most representative aspect.",
                "We possess five or six pictures signed with his hand. His masterpiece,\n      preserved in the National Gallery of London, represents the Virgin seated\n      on a throne and holding the infant Jesus in her arms. What strikes one\n      first when one looks at this figure is the proportion. The body from the\n      neck to the feet is only twice as long as the head, so that it appears\n      extremely short and podgy. This work is not less remarkable for its\n      painting than for its drawing. The great Margaritone had but a limited\n      number of colours in his possession, and he used them in all their purity\n      without ever modifying the tones. From this it follows that his colouring\n      has more vivacity than harmony. The cheeks of the Virgin and those of the\n      Child are of a bright vermilion which the old master, from a naive\n      preference for clear definitions, has placed on each face in two\n      circumferences as exact as if they had been traced out by a pair of\n      compasses.",
                "A learned critic of the eighteenth century, the Abbe Lanzi, has treated\n      Margaritone's works with profound disdain. \"They are,\" he says, \"merely\n      crude daubs. In those unfortunate times people could neither draw nor\n      paint.\" Such was the common opinion of the connoisseurs of the days of\n      powdered wigs. But the great Margaritone and his contemporaries were soon\n      to be avenged for this cruel contempt. There was born in the nineteenth\n      century, in the biblical villages and reformed cottages of pious England,\n      a multitude of little Samuels and little St. Johns, with hair curling like\n      lambs, who, about 1840, and 1850, became spectacled professors and founded\n      the cult of the primitives.",
                "That eminent theorist of Pre-Raphaelitism, Sir James Tuckett, does not\n      shrink from placing the Madonna of the National Gallery on a level with\n      the masterpieces of Christian art. \"By giving to the Virgin's head,\" says\n      Sir James Tuckett, \"a third of the total height of the figure, the old\n      master attracts the spectator's attention and keeps it directed towards\n      the more sublime parts of the human figure, and in particular the eyes,\n      which we ordinarily describe as the spiritual organs. In this picture,\n      colouring and design conspire to produce an ideal and mystical impression.\n      The vermilion of the cheeks does not recall the natural appearance of the\n      skin; it rather seems as if the old master has applied the roses of\n      Paradise to the faces of the Mother and the Child.\"",
                "We see, in such a criticism as this, a shining reflection, so to speak, of\n      the work which it exalts; yet MacSilly, the seraphic aesthete of\n      Edinburgh, has expressed in a still more moving and penetrating fashion\n      the impression produced upon his mind by the sight of this primitive\n      painting. \"The Madonna of Margaritone,\" says the revered MacSilly,\n      \"attains the transcendent end of art. It inspires its beholders with\n      feelings of innocence and purity; it makes them like little children. And\n      so true is this, that at the age of sixty-six, after having had the joy of\n      contemplating it closely for three hours, I felt myself suddenly\n      transformed into a little child. While my cab was taking me through\n      Trafalgar Square I kept laughing and prattling and shaking my\n      spectacle-case as if it were a rattle. And when the maid in my\n      boarding-house had served my meal I kept pouring spoonfuls of soup into my\n      ear with all the artlessness of childhood.\"",
                "\"It is by such results,\" adds MacSilly, \"that the excellence of a work of\n      art is proved.\"",
                "Margaritone, according to Vasari, died at the age of seventy-seven,\n      \"regretting that he had lived to see a new form of art arising and the new\n      artists crowned with fame.\"",
                "These lines, which I translate literally, have inspired Sir James Tuckett\n      with what are perhaps the finest pages in his work. They form part of his\n      \"Breviary for Aesthetes\"; all the Pre-Raphaelites know them by heart. I\n      place them here as the most precious ornament of this book. You will agree\n      that nothing more sublime has been written since the days of the Hebrew\n      prophets.",
                "MARGARITONE'S VISION",
                "Margaritone, full of years and labours, went one day to visit the studio\n      of a young painter who had lately settled in the town. He noticed in the\n      studio a freshly painted Madonna, which, although severe and rigid,\n      nevertheless, by a certain exactness in the proportions and a devilish\n      mingling of light and shade, assumed an appearance of relief and life. At\n      this sight the artless and sublime worker of Arezzo perceived with horror\n      what the future of painting would be. With his brow clasped in his hands\n      he exclaimed:",
                "\"What things of shame does not this figure show forth! I discern in it the\n      end of that Christian art which paints the soul and inspires the beholder\n      with an ardent desire for heaven. Future painters will not restrain\n      themselves as does this one to portraying on the side of a wall or on a\n      wooden panel the cursed matter of which our bodies are formed; they will\n      celebrate and glorify it. They will clothe their figures with dangerous\n      appearances of flesh, and these figures will seem like real persons. Their\n      bodies will be seen; their forms will appear through their clothing. St.\n      Magdalen will have a bosom. St. Martha a belly, St. Barbara hips, St.\n      Agnes buttocks; St. Sebastian will unveil his youthful beauty, and St.\n      George will display beneath his armour the muscular wealth of a robust\n      virility; apostles, confessors, doctors, and God the Father himself will\n      appear as ordinary beings like you and me; the angels will affect an\n      equivocal, ambiguous, mysterious beauty which will trouble hearts. What\n      desire for heaven will these representations impart? None; but from them\n      you will learn to take pleasure in the forms of terrestrial life. Where\n      will painters stop in their indiscreet inquiries? They will stop nowhere.\n      They will go so far as to show men and women naked like the idols of the\n      Romans. There will be a sacred art and a profane art, and the sacred art\n      will not be less profane than the other.\"",
                "\"Get ye behind me, demons,\" exclaimed the old master. For in prophetic\n      vision he saw the righteous and the saints assuming the appearance of\n      melancholy athletes. He saw Apollos playing the lute on a flowery hill, in\n      the midst of the Muses wearing light tunics. He saw Venuses lying under\n      shady myrtles and the Danae exposing their charming sides to the golden\n      rain. He saw pictures of Jesus under the pillar's of the temple amidst\n      patricians, fair ladies, musicians, pages, negroes, dogs, and parrots. He\n      saw in an inextricable confusion of human limbs, outspread wings, and\n      flying draperies, crowds of tumultuous Nativities, opulent Holy Families,\n      emphatic Crucifixions. He saw St. Catherines, St. Barbaras, St. Agneses\n      humiliating patricians by the sumptuousness of their velvets, their\n      brocades, and their pearls, and by the splendour of their breasts. He saw\n      Auroras scattering roses, and a multitude of naked Dianas and Nymphs\n      surprised on the banks of retired streams. And the great Margaritone died,\n      strangled by so horrible a presentiment of the Renaissance and the\n      Bolognese School."

                "We possess a precious monument of the Penguin literature of the fifteenth\n      century. It is a narrative of a journey to hell undertaken by the monk\n      Marbodius, of the order of St. Benedict, who professed a fervent\n      admiration for the poet Virgil. This narrative, written in fairly good\n      Latin, has been published by M. du Clos des Limes. It is here translated\n      for the first time. I believe that I am doing a service to my\n      fellow-countrymen in making them acquainted with these pages, though\n      doubtless they are far from forming a unique example of this class of\n      mediaeval Latin literature. Among the fictions that may be compared with\n      them we may mention \"The Voyage of St. Brendan,\" \"The Vision of\n      Albericus,\" and \"St. Patrick's Purgatory,\" imaginary descriptions, like\n      Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy,\" of the supposed abode of the dead. The\n      narrative of Marbodius is one of the latest works dealing with this theme,\n      but it is not the least singular.",
                "THE DESCENT OF MARBODIUS INTO HELL",
                "In the fourteen hundred and fifty-third year of the incarnation of the Son\n      of God, a few days before the enemies of the Cross entered the city of\n      Helena and the great Constantine, it was given to me, Brother Marbodius,\n      an unworthy monk, to see and to hear what none had hitherto seen or heard.\n      I have composed a faithful narrative of those things so that their memory\n      may not perish with me, for man's time is short.",
                "On the first day of May in the aforesaid year, at the hour of vespers, I\n      was seated in the Abbey of Corrigan on a stone in the cloisters and, as my\n      custom was, I read the verses of the poet whom I love best of all, Virgil,\n      who has sung of the labours: of the field, of shepherds, and of heroes.\n      Evening was hanging its purple folds from the arches of the cloisters and\n      in a voice of emotion I was murmuring the verses which describe how Dido,\n      the Phoenician queen, wanders with her ever-bleeding wound beneath the\n      myrtles of hell. At that moment Brother Hilary happened to pass by,\n      followed by Brother Jacinth, the porter.",
                "Brought up in the barbarous ages before the resurrection of the Muses,\n      Brother Hilary has not been initiated into the wisdom of the ancients;\n      nevertheless, the poetry of the Mantuan has, like a subtle torch, shed\n      some gleams of light into his understanding.",
                "\"Brother Marbodius,\" he asked me, \"do those verses that you utter with\n      swelling breast and sparkling eyes -- do they belong to that great\n      'Aeneid' from which morning or evening your glances are never withheld?\"",
                "I answered that I was reading in Virgil how the son of Anchises perceived\n      Dido like a moon behind the foliage.*",
                "* The text runs\n\n     . . .qualem primo qui syrgere mense\n     Aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam.",
                "Brother Marbodius, by a strange misunderstanding, substitutes an entirely\n      different image for the one created by the poet.",
                "\"Brother Marbodius,\" he replied, \"I am certain that on all occasions\n      Virgil gives expression to wise maxims and profound thoughts. But the\n      songs that he modulates on his Syracusan flute hold such a lofty meaning\n      and such exalted doctrine that I am continually puzzled by them.\"",
                "\"Take care, father,\" cried Brother Jacinth, in an agitated voice. \"Virgil\n      was a magician who wrought marvels by the help of demons. It is thus he\n      pierced through a mountain near Naples and fashioned a bronze horse that\n      had power to heal all the diseases of horses. He was a necromancer, and\n      there is still shown, in a certain town in Italy, the mirror in which he\n      made the dead appear. And yet a woman deceived this great sorcerer. A\n      Neapolitan courtesan invited him to hoist himself up to her window in the\n      basket that was used to bring the provisions, and she left him all night\n      suspended between two storeys.\"",
                "Brother Hilary did not appear to hear these observations.",
                "\"Virgil is a prophet,\" he replied, \"and a prophet who leaves far behind\n      him the sibyls with their sacred verses as well as the daughter of King\n      Priam, and that great diviner of future things, Plato of Athens. You will\n      find in the fourth of his Syracusan cantos the birth of our Lord foretold\n      in a lancune that seems of heaven rather than of earth.* In the time of my\n      early studies, when I read for the first time JAM REDIT ET VIRGO, I felt\n      myself bathed in an infinite delight, but I immediately experienced\n      intense grief at the thought that, for ever deprived of the presence of\n      God, the author of this prophetic verse, the noblest that has come from\n      human lips, was pining among the heathen in eternal darkness. This cruel\n      thought did not leave me. It pursued me even in my studies, my prayers, my\n      meditations, and my ascetic labours. Thinkin that Virgil was deprived of\n      the sight of God and that possibly he might even be suffering the fate of\n      the reprobate in hell, I could neither enjoy peace nor rest, and I went so\n      far as to exclaim several times a day with my arms outstretched to heaven:",
                "\"'Reveal to me, O Lord, the lot thou hast assigned to him who sang on\n      earth as the angels sing in heaven!'",

                "\"After some years my anguish ceased when I read in an old book that the\n      great apostle St. Paul, who called the Gentiles into the Church of Christ,\n      went to Naples and sanctified with his tears the tomb of the prince of\n      poets.* This was some ground for believing that Virgil, like the Emperor\n      Trajan, was admitted to Paradise because even in error he had a\n      presentiment of the truth. We are not compelled to believe it, but I can\n      easily persuade myself that it is true.\"",

                "Having thus spoken, old Hilary wished me the peace of a holy night and\n      went away with Brother Jacinth.",
                "I resumed the delightful study of my poet. Book in hand, I meditated upon\n      the way in which those whom Love destroys with its cruel malady wander\n      through the secret paths in the depth of the myrtle forest, and, as I\n      meditated, the quivering reflections of the stars came and mingled with\n      those of the leafless eglantines in the waters of the cloister fountain.\n      Suddenly the lights and the perfumes and the stillness of the sky were\n      overwhelmed, a fierce Northwind charged with storm and darkness burst\n      roaring upon me. It lifted me up and carried me like a wisp of straw over\n      fields, cities, rivers, and mountains, and through the midst of\n      thunder-clouds, during a long night composed of a whole series of nights\n      and days. And when, after this prolonged and cruel rage, the hurricane was\n      at last stilled, I found myself far from my native land at the bottom of a\n      valley bordered by cypress trees. Then a woman of wild beauty, trailing\n      long garments behind her, approached me. She placed her left hand on my\n      shoulder, and, pointing her right arm to an oak with thick foliage:",
                "\"Look!\" said she to me.",
                "Immediately I recognised the Sibyl who guards the sacred wood of Avernus,\n      and I discerned the fair Proserpine's beautiful golden twig amongst the\n      tufted boughs of the tree to which her finger pointed.",
                "\"O prophetic Virgin,\" I exclaimed, \"thou hast comprehended my desire and\n      thou hast satisfied it in this way. Thou hast revealed to me the tree that\n      bears the shining twig without which none can enter alive into the\n      dwelling-place of the dead. And in truth, eagerly did I long to converse\n      with the shade of Virgil.\"",
                "Having said this, I snatched the golden branch from its ancient trunk and\n      I advanced without fear into the smoking gulf that leads to the miry banks\n      of the Styx, upon which the shades are tossed about like dead leaves. At\n      sight of the branch dedicated to Proserpine, Charon took me in his bark,\n      which groaned beneath my weight, and I alighted on the shores of the dead,\n      and was greeted by the mute baying of the threefold Cerberus. I pretended\n      to throw the shade of a stone at him, and the vain monster fled into his\n      cave. There, amidst the rushes, wandered the souls of those children whose\n      eyes had but opened and shut to the kindly light of day, and there in a\n      gloomy cavern Minos judges men. I penetrated into the myrtle wood in which\n      the victims of love wander languishing, Phaedra, Procris, the sad\n      Eriphyle, Evadne, Pasiphae, Laodamia, and Cenis, and the Phoenician Dido.\n      Then I went through the dusty plains reserved for famous warriors. Beyond\n      them open two ways. That to the left leads to Tartarus, the abode of the\n      wicked. I took that to the right, which leads to Elysium and to the\n      dwellings of Dis. Having hung the sacred branch at the goddess's door, I\n      reached pleasant fields flooded with purple light. The shades of\n      philosophers and poets hold grave converse there. The Graces and the Muses\n      formed sprightly choirs upon the grass. Old Homer sang, accompanying\n      himself upon his rustic lyre. His eyes were closed, but divine images\n      shone upon his lips. I saw Solon, Democritus, and Pythagoras watching the\n      games of the young men in the meadow, and, through the foliage of an\n      ancient laurel, I perceived also Hesiod, Orpheus, the melancholy\n      Euripides, and the masculine Sappho. I passed and recognised, as they sat\n      on the bank of a fresh rivulet, the poet Horace, Varius, Gallus, and\n      Lycoris. A little apart, leaning against the trunk of a dark holm-oak,\n      Virgil was gazing pensively at the grove. Of lofty stature, though spare,\n      he still preserved that swarthy complexion, that rustic air, that\n      negligent bearing, and unpolished appearance which during his lifetime\n      concealed his genius. I saluted him piously and remained for a long time\n      without speech.",
                "At last when my halting voice could proceed out of my throat:",
                "\"O thou, so dear to the Ausonian Muses, thou honour of the Latin name,\n      Virgil,\" cried I, \"it is through thee I have known what beauty is, it is\n      through thee I have known what the tables of the gods and the beds of the\n      goddesses are like. Suffer the praises of the humblest of thy adorers.\"",
                "\"Arise, stranger,\" answered the divine poet. \"I perceive that thou art a\n      living being among the shades, and that thy body treads down the grass in\n      this eternal evening. Thou art not the first man who has descended before\n      his death into these dwellings, although all intercourse between us and\n      the living is difficult. But cease from praise; I do not like eulogies and\n      the confused sounds of glory have always offended my ears. That is why I\n      fled from Rome, where I was known to the idle and curious, and laboured in\n      the solitude of my beloved Parthenope. And then I am not so convinced that\n      the men of thy generation understand my verses that should be gratified by\n      thy praises. Who art thou?\"",
                "\"I am called Marbodius of the Kingdom of Alca. I made my profession in the\n      Abbey of Corrigan. I read thy poems by day and I read them by night. It is\n      thee whom I have come to see in Hell; I was impatient to know what thy\n      fate was. On earth the learned often dispute about it. Some hold it\n      probable that, having lived under the power of demons, thou art now\n      burning in inextinguishable flames; others, more cautious, pronounce no\n      opinion, believing that all which is said concerning the dead is uncertain\n      and full of lies; several, though not in truth the ablest, maintain that,\n      because thou didst elevate the tone of the Sicilian Muses and foretell\n      that a new progeny would descend from heaven, thou wert admitted, like the\n      Emperor Trajan, to enjoy eternal blessedness in the Christian heaven.\"",
                "\"Thou seest that such is not the case,\" answered the shade, smiling.",
                "\"I meet thee in truth, O Virgil, among the heroes and sages in those\n      Elysian Fields which thou thyself hast described. Thus, contrary to what\n      several on earth believe, no one has come to seek thee on the part of Him\n      who reigns on high?\"",
                "After a rather long silence:",
                "\"I will conceal nought from thee. He sent for me; one of his messengers, a\n      simple man, came to say that I was expected, and that, although I had not\n      been initiated into their mysteries, in consideration of my prophetic\n      verses, a place had been reserved for me among those of the new sect. But\n      I refused to accept that invitation; I had no desire to change my lace. I\n      did so not because I share the admiration of the Greeks for the Elysian\n      fields, or because I taste here those joys which caused Proserpine to lose\n      the remembrance of her mother. I never believed much myself in what I say\n      about these things in the 'Aeneid.' I was instructed by philosophers and\n      men of science and I had a correct foreboding of the truth. Life in hell\n      is extremely attenuated; we feel neither pleasure nor pain; we are as if\n      we were not. The dead have no existence here except such as the living\n      lend them. Nevertheless I prefer to remain here.\"",
                "\"But what reason didst thou give, O Virgil, for so strange a refusal?\"",
                "\"I gave excellent ones. I said to the messenger of the god that I did not\n      deserve the honour he brought me, and that a meaning had been given to my\n      verses which they did not bear. In truth I have not in my fourth Eclogue\n      betrayed the faith of my ancestors. Some ignorant Jews alone have\n      interpreted in favour of a barbarian god a verse which celebrates the\n      return of the golden age predicted by the Sibylline oracles. I excused\n      myself then on the ground that I could not occupy a place which was\n      destined for me in error and to which I recognised that I had no right.\n      Then I alleged my disposition and my tastes, which do not accord with the\n      customs of the new heavens.",
                "\"'I am not unsociable,' said I to this man. 'I have shown in life a\n      complaisant and easy disposition, although the extreme simplicity of my\n      habits caused me to be suspected of avarice. I kept nothing for myself\n      alone. My library was open to all and I have conformed my conduct to that\n      fine saying of Euripides, \"all ought to be common among friends.\" Those\n      praises that seemed obtrusive when I myself received them became agreeable\n      to me when addressed to Varius or to Macer. But at bottom I am rustic and\n      uncultivated. I take pleasure in the society of animals; I was so zealous\n      in observing them and took so much care of them that I was regarded, not\n      altogether wrongly, as a good veterinary surgeon. I am told that the\n      people of thy sect claim an immortal soul for themselves, but refuse one\n      to the animals. That is a piece of nonsense that makes me doubt their\n      judgment. Perhaps I love the flocks and the shepherds a little too much.\n      That would not seem right amongst you. There is a maxim to which I\n      endeavour to conform my actions, \"Nothing too much.\" More even than my\n      feeble health my philosophy teaches me to use things with measure. I am\n      sober; a lettuce and some olives with a drop of Falernian wine form all my\n      meals. I have, indeed, to some extent gone with strange women, but I have\n      not delayed over long in taverns to watch the young Syrians dance to the\n      sound of the crotalum.* But if I have restrained my desires it was for my\n      own satisfaction and for the sake of good discipline. To fear pleasure and\n      to fly from joy appears to me the worst insult that one can offer to\n      nature. I am assured that during their lives certain of the elect of thy\n      god abstained from food and avoided women through love of asceticism, and\n      voluntarily exposed themselves to useless sufferings. I should be afraid\n      of meeting those, criminals whose frenzy horrifies me. A poet must not be\n      asked to attach himself too strictly to any scientific or moral doctrine.\n      Moreover, I am a Roman, and the Romans, unlike the Greeks, are unable to\n      pursue profound speculations in a subtle manner. If they adopt a\n      philosophy it is above all in order to derive some practical advantages\n      from it. Siro, who enjoyed great renown among us, taught me the system of\n      Epicurus and thus freed me from vain terrors and turned me aside from the\n      cruelties to which religion persuades ignorant men. I have embraced the\n      views of Pythagoras concerning the souls of men and animals, both of which\n      are of divine essence; this invites us to look upon ourselves without\n      pride and without shame. I have learnt from the Alexandrines how the\n      earth, at first soft and without form, hardened in proportion as Nereus\n      withdrew himself from it to dig his humid dwellings; I have learned how\n      things were formed insensibly; in what manner the rains, falling from the\n      burdened clouds, nourished the silent forests, and by what progress a few\n      animals at last began to wander over the nameless mountains. I could not\n      accustom myself to your cosmogony either, for it seems to me fitter for a\n      camel-driver on the Syrian sands than for a disciple of Aristarchus of\n      Samos. And what would become of me in the abode of your beatitude if I did\n      not find there my friends, my ancestors, my masters, and my gods, and if\n      it is not given to me to see Rhea's noble son, or Venus, mother of Aeneas,\n      with her winning smile, or Pan, or the young Dryads, or the Sylvans, or\n      old Silenus, with his face stained by Aegle's purple mulberries.' These\n      are the reasons which I begged that simple man to plead before the\n      successor of Jupiter.\"",

He was of high stature, thin, with an\n      aquiline nose, sharp chin, and hollow cheeks. His dark eyes shot forth\n      fire; a red hood girt with a crown of laurels bound his lean brows. His\n      bones pierced through the tight brown cloak that descended to his heels.\n      He saluted me with deference, tempered by a sort of fierce pride, and\n      addressed me in a speech more obscure and incorrect than that of those\n      Gauls with whom the divine Julius filled both his legions and the Curia.\n      At last I understood that he had been born near Fiesole, in an ancient\n      Etruscan colony that Sulla had founded on the banks of the Arno, and which\n      had prospered; that he had obtained municipal honours, but that he had\n      thrown himself vehemently into the sanguinary quarrels which arose between\n      the senate, the knights, and the people, that he had been defeated and\n      banished, and now he wandered in exile throughout the world. He described\n      Italy to me as distracted by more wars and discords than in the time of my\n      youth, and as sighing anew for a second Augustus. I pitied his misfortune,\n      remembering what I myself had formerly endured.",
                "\"An audacious spirit unceasingly disquieted him, and his mind harboured\n      great thoughts, but alas! his rudeness and ignorance displayed the triumph\n      of barbarism. He knew neither poetry, nor science, nor even the tongue of\n      the Greeks, and he was ignorant, too, of the ancient traditions concerning\n      the origin of the world and the nature of the gods. He bravely repeated\n      fables which in my time would have brought smiles to the little children\n      who were not yet old enough to pay for admission at the baths. The vulgar\n      easily believe in monsters. The Etruscans especially peopled hell with\n      demons, hideous as a sick man's dreams. That they have not abandoned their\n      childish imaginings after so many centuries is explained by the\n      continuation and progress of ignorance and misery, but that one of their\n      magistrates whose mind is raised above the common level should share these\n      popular illusions and should be frightened by the hideous demons that the\n      inhabitants of that country painted on the walls of their tombs in the\n      time of Porsena -- that is something which might sadden even a sage. My\n      Etruscan visitor repeated verses to me which he had composed in a new\n      dialect, called by him the vulgar tongue, the sense of which I could not\n      understand. My ears were more surprised than charmed as I heard him repeat\n      the same sound three or four times at regular intervals in his efforts to\n      mark the rhythm. That artifice did not seem ingenious to me; but it is not\n      for the dead to judge of novelties.",
                "\"But I do not reproach this colonist of Sulla, born in an unhappy time,\n      for making inharmonious verses or for being, if it be possible, as bad a\n      poet as Bavius or Maevius. I have grievances against him which touch me\n      more closely. The thing is monstrous and scarcely credible, but when this\n      man returned to earth he disseminated the most odious lies about me. He\n      affirmed in several passages of his barbarous poems that I had served him\n      as a guide in the modern Tartarus, a place I know nothing of. He\n      insolently proclaimed that I had spoken of the gods of Rome as false and\n      lying gods, and that I held as the true God the present successor of\n      Jupiter. Friend, when thou art restored to the kindly light of day and\n      beholdest again thy native land, contradict those abominable falsehoods.\n      Say to thy people that the singer of the pious Aeneas has never worshipped\n      the god of the Jews. I am assured that his power is declining and that his\n      approaching fall is manifested by undoubted indications.

Then I understood the\n      meaning of the words, \"The dead have no life, but that which the living\n      lend them,\" and I walked slowly through the pale meadow to the gate of\n      horn.",

He gave his nights to\n      mathematics and music, which he called the two adorable sisters, the\n      harmonious daughters of Number and Imagination.

Aegidius Aucupis fled, and reached the island\n      of Ireland, where he lived for thirty studious years. He went from\n      monastery to monastery, searching for and copying the Greek and Latin\n      manuscripts which they contained. He also studied physics and alchemy. He\n      acquired a universal knowledge and discovered notable secrets concerning\n      animals, plants, and stones. He was found one day in the company of a very\n      beautiful woman who sang to her own accompaniment on the lute, and who was\n      afterwards discovered to be a machine which he had himself constructed.",

During one of these crossings, as\n      he remained during the night on the bridge of the ship, he saw beneath the\n      waters two sturgeons swimming side by side.

Men\n      no longer pursued the nymphs of the fountains, of the woods, and of the\n      mountains with their insults.

But that great man mistook the elegances of\n      the humanists for softness of manners, and he did not foresee the effects\n      that the awaking of intelligence would have amongst the Penguins. It\n      brought about the religious Reformation; Catholics massacred Protestants\n      and Protestants massacred Catholics. Such were the first results of\n      liberty of thought. The Catholics prevailed in Penguinia. But the spirit\n      of inquiry had penetrated among them without their knowing it. They joined\n      reason to faith, and claimed that religion had been divested of the\n      superstitious practices that dishonoured it, just as in later days the\n      booths that the cobblers, hucksters, and dealers in old clothes had built\n      against the walls of the cathedrals were cleared away. The word, legend,\n      which at first indicated what the faithful ought to read, soon suggested\n      the idea of pious fables and childish tales.",
                "The saints had to suffer from this state of mind. An obscure canon called\n      Princeteau, a very austere and crabbed man, designated so great a number\n      of them as not worthy of having their days observed, that he was surnamed\n      the exposer of the saints. He did not think, for instance, that if St.\n      Margaret's prayer were applied as a poultice to a woman in travail that\n      the pains of childbirth would be softened.",
                "Even the venerable patron saint of Penguinia did not escape his rigid\n      criticism. This is what he says of her in his \"Antiquities of Alca\":",

An ancient anonymous annalist, a monk of Dombes, relates that a\n      woman called Orberosia was possessed by the devil in a cavern where, even\n      down to his own days, the little boys and girls of the village used to\n      play at a sort of game representing the devil and the fair Orberosia. He\n      adds that this woman became the concubine of a horrible dragon, who\n      ravaged the country. Such a statement is hardly credible, but the history\n      of Orberosia, as it has since been related, seems hardly more worthy of\n      belief. The life of that saint by the Abbot Simplicissimus is three\n      hundred years later than the pretended events which it relates and that\n      author shows himself excessively credulous and devoid of all critical\n      faculty.\"",
                "Suspicion attacked even the supernatural origin of the Penguins. The\n      historian Ovidius Capito went so far as to deny the miracle of their\n      transformation. He thus begins his \"Annals of Penguinia\":",
                "\"A dense obscurity envelopes this history, and it would be no exaggeration\n      to say that it is a tissue of puerile fables and popular tales.

They hold that, situated at first in the frozen ocean, their\n      island, floating like Delos, was brought to anchor in these\n      heaven-favoured seas, of which it is to-day the queen.

                "In the following century, which was that of the philosophers, scepticism\n      became still more acute. No further evidence of it is needed than the\n      following celebrated passage from the \"Moral Essay\":",
                "\"Arriving we know not from whence (for indeed their origins are not very\n      clear), and successively invaded and conquered by four or five peoples\n      from the north, south, east, and west, miscegenated, interbred,\n      amalgamated, and commingled, the Penguins boast of the purity of their\n      race, and with justice, for they have become a pure race. This mixture of\n      all mankind, red, black, yellow, and white, round-headed and long-headed,\n      as formed in the course of ages a fairly homogeneous human family, and one\n      which is recognisable by certain features due to a community of life and\n      customs.",
                "\"This idea that they belong to the best race in the world, and that they\n      are its finest family, inspires them with noble pride, indomitable\n      courage, and a hatred for the human race.",
                "\"The life of a people is but a succession of miseries, crimes, and\n      follies. This is true of the Penguin nation, as of all other nations. Save\n      for this exception its history is admirable from beginning to end.\"",
                "The two classic ages of the Penguins are too well-known for me to lay\n      stress upon them. But what has not been sufficiently noticed is the way in\n      which the rationalist theologians such as Canon Princeteau called into\n      existence the unbelievers of the succeeding age. The former employed their\n      reason to destroy what did not seem to them, essential to their religion;\n      they only left untouched the most rigid article of faith. Their\n      intellectual successors, being taught by them how to make use of science\n      and reason, employed them against whatever beliefs remained. Thus rational\n      theology engendered natural philosophy.",
                "That is why (if I may turn from the Penguins of former days to the\n      Sovereign Pontiff, who, to-day governs the universal Church) we cannot\n      admire too greatly the wisdom of Pope Pius X. in condemning the study of\n      exegesis as contrary to revealed truth, fatal to sound theological\n      doctrine, and deadly to the faith. Those clerics who maintain the rights\n      of science in opposition to him are pernicious doctors and pestilent\n      teachers, and the faithful who approve of them are lacking in either\n      mental or moral ballast.",
                "At the end of the age of philosophers, the ancient kingdom of Penguinia\n      was utterly destroyed, the king put to death, the privileges of the nobles\n      abolished, and a Republic proclaimed in the midst of public misfortunes\n      and while a terrible war was raging. The assembly which then governed\n      Penguinia ordered all the metal articles contained in the churches to be\n      melted down. The patriots even desecrated the tombs of the kings. It is\n      said that when the tomb of Draco the Great was opened, that king presented\n      an appearance as black as ebony and so majestic that those who profaned\n      his corpse fled in terror. According to other accounts, these churlish men\n      insulted him by putting a pipe in his mouth and derisively offering him a\n      glass of wine.",
                "On the seventeenth day of the month of Mayflowers, the shrine of St.\n      Orberosia, which had for five hundred years been exposed to the veneration\n      of the faithful in the Church of St. Mael, was transported into the\n      town-hall and submitted to the examination of a jury of experts appointed\n      by the municipality. It was made of gilded copper in shape like the nave\n      of a church, entirely covered with enamels and decorated with precious\n      stones, which latter were perceived to be false. The chapter in its\n      foresight had removed the rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and great balls of\n      rock-crystal, and had substituted pieces of glass in their place. It\n      contained only a little dust and a piece of old linen, which were thrown\n      into a great fire that had been lighted on the Place de Greve to burn the\n      relics of the saints. The people danced around it singing patriotic songs.",
                "From the threshold of their booth, which leant against the town-hall, a\n      man called Rouquin and his wife were watching this group of madmen.\n      Rouquin clipped dogs and gelded cats; he also frequented the inns. His\n      wife was a ragpicker and a bawd, but she had plenty of shrewdness.",

                "After a succession of amazing vicissitudes, the memory of which is in\n      great part lost by the wrongs of time and the bad style of historians, the\n      Penguins established the government of the Penguins by themselves. They\n      elected a diet or assembly, and invested it with the privilege of naming\n      the Head of the State. The latter, chosen from among the simple Penguins,\n      wore no formidable monster's crest upon his head and exercised no absolute\n      authority over the people. He was himself subject to the laws of the\n      nation. He was not given the title of king, and no ordinal number followed\n      his name. He bore such names as Paturle, Janvion, Traffaldin, Coquenhot,\n      and Bredouille. These magistrates did not make war. They were not suited\n      for that.",
                "The new state received the name of Public Thing or Republic. Its partisans\n      were called republicanists or republicans. They were also named\n      Thingmongers and sometimes Scamps, but this latter name was taken in ill\n      part.",
                "The Penguin democracy did not itself govern. It obeyed a financial\n      oligarchy which formed opinion by means of the newspapers, and held in its\n      hands the representatives, the ministers, and the president. It controlled\n      the finances of the republic, and directed the foreign affairs of the\n      country as if it were possessed of sovereign power.",
                "Empires and kingdoms in those days kept up enormous fleets. Penguinia,\n      compelled to do as they did, sank under the pressure of her armaments.\n      Everybody deplored or pretended to deplore so grievous a necessity.\n      However, the rich, and those engaged in business or affairs, submitted to\n      it with a good heart through a spirit of patriotism, and because they\n      counted on the soldiers and sailors to defend their goods at home and to\n      acquire markets and territories abroad. The great manufacturers encouraged\n      the making of cannons and ships through a zeal for the national defence\n      and in order to obtain orders. Among the citizens of middle rank and of\n      the liberal professions some resigned themselves to this state of affairs\n      without complaining, believing that it would last for ever; others waited\n      impatiently for its end and thought they might be able to lead the powers\n      to a simultaneous disarmament.",
                "The illustrious Professor Obnubile belonged to this latter class.",
                "\"War,\" said he, \"is a barbarity to which the progress of civilization will\n      put an end. The great democracies are pacific and will soon impose their\n      will upon the aristocrats.\"",
                "Professor Obnubile, who had for sixty years led a solitary and retired\n      life in his laboratory, whither external noises did not penetrate,\n      resolved to observe the spirit of the peoples for himself. He began his\n      studies with the greatest of all democracies and set sail for New\n      Atlantis.",
                "After a voyage of fifteen days his steamer entered, during the night, the\n      harbour of Titanport, where thousands of ships were anchored. An iron\n      bridge thrown across the water and shining with lights, stretched between\n      two piers so far apart that Professor Obnubile imagined he was sailing on\n      the seas of Saturn and that he saw the marvellous ring which girds the\n      planet of the Old Man. And this immense conduit bore upon it more than a\n      quarter of the wealth of the world. The learned Penguin, having\n      disembarked, was waited on by automatons in a hotel forty-eight stories\n      high. Then he took the great railway that led to Gigantopolis, the capital\n      of New Atlantis. In the train there were restaurants, gaming-rooms,\n      athletic arenas, telegraphic, commercial, and financial offices, a\n      Protestant Church, and the printing-office of a great newspaper, which\n      latter the doctor was unable to read, as he did not know the language of\n      the New Atlantans. The train passed along the banks of great rivers,\n      through manufacturing cities which concealed the sky with the smoke from\n      their chimneys, towns black in the day, towns red at night, full of noise\n      by day and full of noise also by night.",
                "\"Here,\" thought the doctor, \"is a people far too much engaged in industry\n      and trade to make war. I am already certain that the New Atlantans pursue\n      a policy of peace. For it is an axiom admitted by all economists that\n      peace without and peace within are necessary for the progress of commerce\n      and industry.\"",
                "As he surveyed Gigantopolis, he was confirmed in this opinion. People went\n      through the streets so swiftly propelled by hurry that they knocked down\n      all who were in their way. Obnubile was thrown down several times, but\n      soon succeeded in learning how to demean himself better; after an hour's\n      walking he himself knocked down an Atlantan.",
                "Having reached a great square he saw the portico of a palace in the\n      Classic style, whose Corinthian columns reared their capitals of\n      arborescent acanthus seventy metres above the stylobate.",
                "As he stood with his head thrown back admiring the building, a man of\n      modest appearance approached him and said in Penguin:",
                "\"I see by your dress that you are from Penguinia. I know your language; I\n      am a sworn interpreter. This is the Parliament palace. At the present\n      moment the representatives of the States are in deliberation. Would you\n      like to be present at the sitting?\"",
                "The doctor was brought into the hall and cast his looks upon the crowd of\n      legislators who were sitting on cane chairs with their feet upon their\n      desks.",
                "The president arose and, in the midst of general inattention, muttered\n      rather than spoke the following formulas which the interpreter immediately\n      translated to the doctor.",
                "\"The war for the opening of the Mongol markets being ended to the\n      satisfaction of the States, I propose that the accounts be laid before the\n      finance committee . . . .\"",

                "\"The proposal is carried.\"",

                "\"Is there any opposition? . . .\"",
                "\"The proposal is carried.\"",
                "\"Have I heard aright?\" asked Professor Obnubile. \"What? you an industrial\n      people and engaged in all these wars!\"",
                "\"Certainly,\" answered the interpreter, \"these are industrial wars. Peoples\n      who have neither commerce nor industry are not obliged to make war, but a\n      business people is forced to adopt a policy of conquest. The number of\n      wars necessarily increases with our productive activity. As soon as one of\n      our industries fails to find a market for its products a war is necessary\n      to open new outlets. It is in this way we have had a coal war, a copper\n      war, and a cotton war. In Third-Zealand we have killed two-thirds of the\n      inhabitants in order to compel the remainder to buy our umbrellas and\n      braces.\"",
                "At that moment a fat man who was sitting in the middle of the assembly\n      ascended the tribune.",
                "\"I claim,\" said he, \"a war against the Emerald Republic, which insolently\n      contends with our pigs for the hegemony of hams and sauces in all the\n      markets of the universe.\"",
                "\"Who is that legislator?\" asked Doctor Obnubile.",
                "\"He is a pig merchant.\"",
                "\"Is there any opposition?\" said the President. \"I put the proposition to\n      the vote.\"",
                "The war against the Emerald Republic was voted with uplifted hands by a\n      very large majority.",
                "\"What?\" said Obnubile to the interpreter; \"you have voted a war with that\n      rapidity and that indifference!\"",
                "\"Oh! it is an unimportant war which will hardly cost eight million\n      dollars.\"",
                "\"And men . . .\"",
                "\"The men are included in the eight million dollars.\"",
                "Then Doctor Obnubile bent his head in bitter reflection.",
                "\"Since wealth and civilization admit of as many causes of wars as poverty\n      and barbarism, since the folly and wickedness of men are incurable, there\n      remains but one good action to be done. The wise man will collect enough\n      dynamite to blow up this planet. When its fragments fly through space an\n      imperceptible amelioration will be accomplished in the universe and a\n      satisfaction will be given to the universal conscience. Moreover, this\n      universal conscience does not exist.\""

                "Every system of government produces people who are dissatisfied. The\n      Republic or Public Thing produced them at first from among the nobles who\n      had been despoiled of their ancient privileges. These looked with regret\n      and hope to Prince Crucho, the last of the Draconides, a prince adorned\n      both with the grace of youth and the melancholy of exile. It also produced\n      them from among the smaller traders, who, owing to profound economic\n      causes, no longer gained a livelihood. They believed that this was the\n      fault of the republic which they had at first adored and from which each\n      day they were now becoming more detached. The financiers, both Christians\n      and Jews, became by their insolence and their cupidity the scourge of the\n      country, which they plundered and degraded, as well as the scandal of a\n      government which they never troubled either to destroy or preserve, so\n      confident were they that they could operate without hindrance under all\n      governments. Nevertheless, their sympathies inclined to absolute power as\n      the best protection against the socialists, their puny but ardent\n      adversaries. And just as they imitated the habits of the aristocrats, so\n      they imitated their political and religious sentiments. Their women, in\n      particular, loved the Prince and had dreams of appearing one day at his\n      Court.",
                "However, the Republic retained some partisans and defenders. If it was not\n      in a position to believe in the fidelity of its own officials it could at\n      least still count on the devotion of the manual labourers, although it had\n      never relieved their misery. These came forth in crowds from their\n      quarries and their factories to defend it, and marched in long\n      processions, gloomy, emaciated, and sinister. They would have died for it\n      because it had given them hope.",
                "Now, under the Presidency of Theodore Formose, there lived in a peaceable\n      suburb of Alca a monk called Agaric, who kept a school and assisted in\n      arranging marriages. In his school he taught fencing and riding to the\n      sons of old families, illustrious by their birth, but now as destitute of\n      wealth as of privilege. And as soon as they were old enough he married\n      them to the daughters of the opulent and despised caste of financiers.",
                "Tall, thin, and dark, Agaric used to walk in deep thought, with his\n      breviary in his hand and his brow loaded with care, through the corridors\n      of the school and the alleys of the garden. His care was not limited to\n      inculcating in his pupils abstruse doctrines and mechanical precepts and\n      to endowing them afterwards with legitimate and rich wives. He entertained\n      political designs and pursued the realisation of a gigantic plan. His\n      thought of thoughts and labour of labours was to overthrow the Republic.\n      He was not moved to this by any personal interest. He believed that a\n      democratic state was opposed to the holy society to which body and soul he\n      belonged. And all the other monks, his brethren, thought the same. The\n      Republic was perpetually at strife with the congregation of monks and the\n      assembly of the faithful. True, to plot the death of the new government\n      was a difficult and perilous enterprise. Still, Agaric was in a position\n      to carry on a formidable conspiracy. At that epoch, when the clergy guided\n      the superior classes of the Penguins, this monk exercised a tremendous\n      influence over the aristocracy of Alca.",
                "All the young men whom he had brought up waited only for a favourable\n      moment to march against the popular power. The sons of the ancient\n      families did not practise the arts or engage in business. They were almost\n      all soldiers and served the Republic. They served it, but they did not\n      love it; they regretted the dragon's crest. And the fair Jewesses shared\n      in these regrets in order that they might be taken for Christians.",
                "One July as he was walking in a suburban street which ended in some dusty\n      fields, Agaric heard groans coming from a moss-grown well that had been\n      abandoned by the gardeners. And almost immediately he was told by a\n      cobbler of the neighbourhood that a ragged man who had shouted out \"Hurrah\n      for the Republic!\" had been thrown into the well by some cavalry officers\n      who were passing, and had sunk up to his ears in the mud. Agaric was quite\n      ready to see a general significance in this particular fact. He inferred a\n      great fermentation in the whole aristocratic and military caste, and\n      concluded that it was the moment to act.",
                "The next day he went to the end of the Wood of Conils to visit the good\n      Father Cornemuse. He found the monk in his laboratory pouring a\n      golden-coloured liquor into a still. He was a short, fat, little man, with\n      vermilion-tinted cheeks and an elaborately polished bald head. His eyes\n      had ruby-coloured pupils like a guinea-pig's. He graciously saluted his\n      visitor and offered him a glass of the St. Orberosian liqueur, which he\n      manufactured, and from the sale of which he gained immense wealth.",
                "Agaric made a gesture of refusal. Then, standing on his long feet and\n      pressing his melancholy hat against his stomach, he remained silent.",
                "\"Take a seat,\" said Cornemuse to him.",
                "Agaric sat down on a rickety stool, but continued mute.",
                "Then the monk of Conils inquired:",
                "\"Tell me some news of your young pupils. Have the dear children sound\n      views?\"",
                "\"I am very satisfied with them,\" answered the teacher. \"It is everything\n      to be nurtured in sound principles. It is necessary to have sound views\n      before having any views at all, for afterwards it is too late. . . . Yes,\n      I have great grounds for comfort. But we live in a sad age.\"",
                "\"Alas!\" sighed Cornemuse.",
                "\"We are passing through evil days. . . .\"",
                "\"Times of trial.\"",
                "\"Yet, Cornemuse, the mind of the public is not so entirely corrupted as it\n      seems.\"",
                "\"Perhaps you are right.\"",
                "\"The people are tired of a government that ruins them and does nothing for\n      them. Every day fresh scandals spring up. The Republic is sunk in shame.\n      It is ruined.\"",
                "\"May God grant it!\"",
                "\"Cornemuse, what do you think of Prince Crucho?\"",
                "\"He is an amiable young man and, I dare say, a worthy scion of an august\n      stock. I pity him for having to endure the pains of exile at so early an\n      age. Spring has no flowers for the exile, and autumn no fruits. Prince\n      Crucho has sound views; he respects the clergy; he practises our religion;\n      besides, he consumes a good deal of my little products.\"",
                "\"Cornemuse, in many homes, both rich and poor, his return is hoped for.\n      Believe me, he will come back.\"",
                "\"May I live to throw my mantle beneath his feet!\" sighed Cornemuse.",
                "Seeing that he held these sentiments, Agaric depicted to him the state of\n      people's minds such as he himself imagined them. He showed him the nobles\n      and the rich exasperated against the popular government; the army refusing\n      to endure fresh insults; the officials willing to betray their chiefs; the\n      people discontented, riot ready to burst forth, and the enemies of the\n      monks, the agents of the constituted authority, thrown into the wells of\n      Alca. He concluded that it was the moment to strike a great blow.",
                "\"We can,\" he cried, \"save the Penguin people, we can deliver it from its\n      tyrants, deliver it from itself, restore the Dragon's crest, re-establish\n      the ancient State, the good State, for the honour of the faith and the\n      exaltation of the Church. We can do this if we will. We possess great\n      wealth and we exert secret influences; by our evangelistic and outspoken\n      journals we communicate with all the ecclesiastics in towns and county\n      alike, and we inspire them with our own eager enthusiasm and our own\n      burning faith. They will kindle their penitents and their congregations. I\n      can dispose of the chiefs of the army; I have an understanding with the\n      men of the people. Unknown to them I sway the minds of umbrella sellers,\n      publicans, shopmen, gutter merchants, newspaper boys, women of the\n      streets, and police agents. We have more people on our side than we need.\n      What are we waiting for? Let us act!\"",
                "\"What do you think of doing?\" asked Cornemuse.",
                "\"Of forming a vast conspiracy and overthrowing the Republic, of\n      re-establishing Crucho on the throne of the Draconides.\"",
                "Cornemuse moistened his lips with his tongue several times. Then he said\n      with unction:",
                "\"Certainly the restoration of the Draconides is desirable; it is eminently\n      desirable; and for my part, desire it with all my heart. As for the\n      Republic, you know what I think of it. . . . But would it not te better to\n      abandon it to its fate and let it die of the vices of its own\n      constitution? Doubtless, Agaric, what you propose is noble and generous.\n      It would be a fine thing to save this great and unhappy country, to\n      re-establish it in its ancient splendour. But reflect on it, we are\n      Christians before we are Penguins. And we must take heed not to compromise\n      religion in political enterprises.\"",
                "Agaric replied eagerly:",
                "\"Fear nothing. We shall hold all the threads of the plot, but we ourselves\n      shall remain in the background. We shall not be seen.\"",
                "\"Like flies in milk,\" murmured the monk of Conils.",
                "And turning his keen ruby-coloured eyes towards his brother monk:",
                "\"Take care. Perhaps the Republic is stronger than it seems. Possibly, too,\n      by dragging it out of the nerveless inertia in which it now rests we may\n      only consolidate its forces. Its malice is great; if we attack it, it will\n      defend itself. It makes bad laws which hardly affect us; if it is\n      frightened it will make terrible ones against us. Let us not lightly\n      engage in an adventure in which we may get fleeced. You think the\n      opportunity a good one. I don't, and I am going to tell you why. The\n      present government is not yet known by everybody, that is to say, it is\n      known by nobody. It proclaims that it is the Public Thing, the common\n      thing. The populace believes it and remains democratic and Republican. But\n      patience! This same people will one day demand that the public thing be\n      the people's thing. I need not tell you how insolent, unregulated, and\n      contrary to Scriptural polity such claims seem to me. But the people will\n      make them, and enforce them, and then there will be an end of the present\n      government. The moment cannot now be far distant; and it is then that we\n      ought to act in the interests of our august body. Let us wait. What\n      hurries us? Our existence is not in peril. It has not been rendered\n      absolutely intolerable to us. The Republic fails in respect and submission\n      to us; it does not give the priests the honours it owes them. But it lets\n      us live. And such is the excellence of our position that with us to live\n      is to prosper. The Republic is hostile to us, but women revere us.\n      President Formose does not assist at the celebration of our mysteries, but\n      I have seen his wife and daughters at my feet. They buy my phials by the\n      gross. I have no better clients even among the aristocracy. Let us say\n      what there is to be said for it. There is no country in the world as good\n      for priests and monks as Penguinia. In what other country would you find\n      our virgin wax, our virile incense, our rosaries, our scapulars, our holy\n      water, and our St. Orberosian liqueur sold in such great quantities? What\n      other people would, like the Penguins, give a hundred golden crowns for a\n      wave of our hands, a sound from our mouths, a movement of our lips? For my\n      part, I gain a thousand times more, in this pleasant, faithful, and docile\n      Penguinia, by extracting the essence from a bundle of thyme, than I could\n      make by tiring my lungs with preaching the remission of sins in the most\n      populous states of Europe and America. Honestly, would Penguinia be better\n      off if a police officer came to take me away from here and put me on a\n      steamboat bound for the Islands of Night?\"",
                "Having thus spoken, the monk of Conils got up and led his guest into a\n      huge shed where hundreds of orphans clothed in blue were packing bottles,\n      nailing up cases, and gumming tickets. The ear was deafened by the noise\n      of hammers mingled with the dull rumbling of bales being placed upon the\n      rails.",
                "\"It is from here that consignments are forwarded,\" said Cornemuse. \"I have\n      obtained from the government a railway through the Wood and a station at\n      my door. Every three days I fill a truck with my own products. You see\n      that the Republic has not killed all beliefs.\"",
                "Agaric made a last effort to engage the wise distiller in his enterprise.\n      He pointed him to a prompt, certain, dazzling success.",

                "The prince belonged to the highest nobility. The Torticol des Boscenos\n      went back to Brian the Good, and under the Draconides had held the highest\n      offices in the kingdom. In 1179, Philip Torticol, High Admiral of\n      Penguinia, a brave, faithful, and generous, but vindictive man, delivered\n      over the port of La Crique and the Penguin fleet to the enemies of the\n      kingdom, because he suspected that Queen Crucha, whose lover he was, had\n      been unfaithful to him and loved a stable-boy. It was that great queen who\n      gave to the Boscenos the silver warming-pan which they bear in their arms.\n      As for their motto, it only goes back to the sixteenth century. The story\n      of its origin is as follows: One gala night, as he mingled with the crowd\n      of courtiers who were watching the fire-works in the king's garden, Duke\n      John des Boscenos approached the Duchess of Skull and put his hand under\n      the petticoat of that lady, who made no complaint at the gesture. The\n      king, happening to pass, surprised them and contented himself with saying,\n      \"And thus I find you.\" These four words became the motto of the Boscenos.",
                "Prince Adelestan had not degenerated from his ancestors. He preserved an\n      unalterable fidelity for the race of the Draconides and desired nothing so\n      much as the restoration of Prince Crucho, an event which was in his eyes\n      to be the fore-runner of the restoration of his own fortune. He therefore\n      readily entered into the Reverend Father Agaric's plans. He joined himself\n      at once to the monk's projects, and hastened to put him into communication\n      with the most loyal Royalists of his acquaintance, Count Clena, M. de La\n      Trumelle, Viscount Olive, and M. Bigourd. They met together one night in\n      the Duke of Ampoule's country house, six miles eastward of Alca, to\n      consider ways and means.",
                "M. de La Trumelle was in favour of legal action.",
                "\"We ought to keep within the law,\" said he in substance. \"We are for\n      order. It is by an untiring propaganda that we shall best pursue the\n      realisation of our hopes. We must change the feeling of the country. Our\n      cause will conquer because it is just.\"",
                "The Prince des Boscenos expressed a contrary opinion. He thought that, in\n      order to triumph, just causes need force quite as much and even more than\n      unjust causes require it.",
                "\"In the present situation,\" said he tranquilly, \"three methods of action\n      present themselves: to hire the butcher boys, to corrupt the ministers,\n      and to kidnap President Formose.\"",
                "\"It would be a mistake to kidnap Formose,\" objected M. de La Trumelle.\n      \"The President is on our side.\"",
                "The attitude and sentiments of the President of the Republic are explained\n      by the fact that one Dracophil proposed to seize Formose while another\n      Dracophil regarded him as a friend. Formose showed himself favourable to\n      the Royalists, whose habits he admired and imitated. If he smiled at the\n      mention of the Dragon's crest it was at the thought of putting it on his\n      own head. He was envious of sovereign power, not because he felt himself\n      capable of exercising it, but because he loved to appear so. According to\n      the expression of a Penguin chronicler, \"he was a goose.\"",
                "Prince des Boscenos maintained his proposal to march against Formose's\n      palace and the House of Parliament.",

At last he consented to discuss it.",

                "\"Gentlemen, the Penguins are dissatisfied with the new order because it\n      exists, and it is natural for men to complain of their condition. But at\n      the same time the Penguins are afraid to change their government because\n      new things alarm them. They have not known the Dragon's crest and,\n      although they sometimes say that they regret it, we must not believe them.\n      It is easy to see that they speak in this way either without thought or\n      because they are in an ill-temper. Let us not have any illusions about\n      their feelings towards ourselves. They do not like us. They hate the\n      aristocracy both from a base envy and from a generous love of equality.\n      And these two united feelings are very strong in a people. Public opinion\n      is not against us, because it knows nothing about us. But when it knows\n      what we want it will not follow us. If we let it be seen that we wish to\n      destroy democratic government and restore the Dragon's crest, who will be\n      our partisans? Only the butcher-boys and the little shopkeepers of Alca.\n      And could we even count on them to the end? They are dissatisfied, but at\n      the bottom of their hearts they are Republicans. They are more anxious to\n      sell their cursed wares than to see Crucho again. If we act openly we\n      shall only cause alarm.",
                "\"To make people sympathise with us and follow us we must make them believe\n      that we want, not to overthrow the Republic, but, on the contrary, to\n      restore it, to cleanse, to purify, to embellish, to adorn, to beautify,\n      and to ornament it, to render it, in a word, glorious and attractive.\n      Therefore, we ought not to act openly ourselves. It is known that we are\n      not favourable to the present order. We must have recourse to a friend of\n      the Republic, and, if we are to do what is best, to a defender of this\n      government. We have plenty to choose from. It would be well to prefer the\n      most popular and, if I dare say so, the most republican of them. We shall\n      win him over to us by flattery, by presents, and above all by promises.\n      Promises cost less than presents, and are worth more. No one gives as much\n      as he who gives hopes. It is not necessary for the man we choose to be of\n      brilliant intellect. I would even prefer him to be of no great ability.\n      Stupid people show an inimitable grace in roguery. Be guided by me,\n      gentlemen, and overthrow the Republic by the agency of a Republican. Let\n      us be prudent. But prudence does not exclude energy. If you need me you\n      will find me at your disposal.\"",

But each of them was anxious\n      to appoint himself to a position of honour and profit. A secret government\n      was organised of which all those present were elected active members.

                "As the workman, astride on his coping, showed no sign of budging, the\n      prince climbed quickly up the staircase of the tower and attacked the\n      singer. He gave him a blow that broke his jaw-bone and sent him rolling\n      into a water-spout. At that moment seven or eight carpenters, who were\n      working on the rafters, heard their companion's cry and looked through the\n      window. Seeing the prince on the coping they climbed along a ladder that\n      was leaning on the slates and reached him just as he was slipping into the\n      tower. They sent him, head foremost, down the one hundred and thirty-seven\n      steps of the spiral staircase."

The smallest amount of\n      thought will prevent any surprise at this. For all armies are the finest\n      in the world. The second finest army, if one could exist, would be in a\n      notoriously inferior position; it would be certain to be beaten. It ought\n      to be disbanded at once. Therefore, all armies are the finest in the\n      world. In France the illustrious Colonel Marchand understood this when,\n      before the passage of the Yalou, being questioned by some journalists\n      about the Russo-Japanese war, he did not hesitate to describe the Russian\n      army as the finest in the world, and also the Japanese. And it should be\n      noticed that even after suffering the most terrible reverses an army does\n      not fall from its position of being the finest in the world. For if\n      nations ascribe their victories to the ability of their generals and the\n      courage of their soldiers, they always attribute their defeats to an\n      inexplicable fatality. On the other hand, navies are classed according to\n      the number of their ships. There is a first, a second, a third, and so on.\n      So that there exists no doubt as to the result of naval wars.",

But for some minutes he thought her\n      extremely pretty, and he felt this impression still more when two bare\n      arms and the rosy palms of two delicate hands touched him lightly. He\n      yielded almost immediately. Olive was slow in fastening the ribbon. Then\n      when it was done she made a low courtesy and saluted Chatillon with the\n      title of Constable.",

                "Morning and evening the newspapers that had been bought by the Dracophils\n      proclaimed Chatillon's praises and hurled shame and opprobrium upon the\n      Ministers of the Republic. Chatillon's portrait was sold through the\n      streets of Alca. Those young descendants of Remus who carry plaster\n      figures on their heads, offered busts of Chatillon for sale upon the\n      bridges.",
                "Every evening Chatillon rode upon his white horse round the Queen's\n      Meadow, a place frequented by the people of fashion. The Dracophils posted\n      along the Emiral's route a crowd of needy Penguins who kept shouting: \"It\n      is Chatillon we want.\" The middle classes of Alca conceived a profound\n      admiration for the Emiral. Shopwomen murmured: \"He is good-looking.\" Women\n      of fashion slackened the speed of their motor-cars and kissed hands to him\n      as they passed, amidst the hurrahs of an enthusiastic populace.",
                "One day, as he went into a tobacco shop, two Penguins who were putting\n      letters in the box recognized Chatillon and cried at the top of their\n      voices: \"Hurrah for the Emiral! Down with the Republicans.\" All those who\n      were passing stopped in front of the shop. Chatillon lighted his cigar\n      before the eyes of a dense crowd of frenzied citizens who waved their hats\n      and cheered. The crowd kept increasing, and the whole town, singing and\n      marching behind its hero, went back with him to the Admiralty.",
                "The Emiral had an old comrade in arms, Under-Emiral Vulcanmould, who had\n      served with great distinction, a man as true as gold and as loyal as his\n      sword. Vulcanmould plumed himself on his thoroughgoing independence and he\n      went among the partisans of Crucho and the Minister of the Republic\n      telling both parties what he thought of them. M. Bigourd maliciously\n      declared that he told each party what the other party thought of it. In\n      truth he had on several occasions been guilty of regrettable\n      indiscretions, which were overlooked as being the freedoms of a soldier\n      who knew nothing of intrigue. Every morning he went to see Chatillon, whom\n      he treated with the cordial roughness of a brother in arms.",
                "\"Well, old buffer, so you are popular,\" said he to him. \"Your phiz is sold\n      on the heads of pipes and on liqueur bottles and every drunkard in Alca\n      spits out your name as he rolls in the gutter. . . . Chatillon, the hero\n      of the Penguins! Chatillon, defender of the Penguin glory! . . . Who would\n      have said it? Who would have thought it?\"",
                "And he laughed with his harsh laugh. Then changing his tone: \"But, joking\n      aside, are you not a bit surprised at what is happening to you?\"",
                "\"No, indeed,\" answered Chatillon.",
                "And out went the honest Vulcanmould, banging the door behind him.",
                "In the mean time Chatillon had taken a little flat at number 18\n      Johannes-Talpa Street, so that he might receive Viscountess Olive. They\n      met there every day. He was desperately in love with her. During his\n      martial and neptunian life he had loved crowds of women, red, black,\n      yellow, and white, and some of them had been very beautiful. But before he\n      met the Viscountess he did not know what a woman really was. When the\n      Viscountess Olive called him her darling, her dear darling, he felt in\n      heaven and it seemed to him that the stars shone in her hair.",
                "She would come a little late, and, as she put her bag on the table, she\n      would ask pensively:",
                "\"Let me sit on your knee.\"",
                "And then she would talk of subjects suggested by the pious Agaric,\n      interrupting the conversation with sighs and kisses. She would ask him to\n      dismiss such and such an officer, to give a command to another, to send\n      the squadron here or there. And at the right moment she would exclaim:",
                "\"How young you are, my dear!\"",
                "And he did whatever she wished, for he was simple, he was anxious to wear\n      the Constable's sword, and to receive a large grant; he did not dislike\n      playing a double part, he had a vague idea of saving Penguinia, and he was\n      in love.",
                "This delightful woman induced him to remove the troops that were at La\n      Cirque, the port where Crucho was to land. By this means it was made\n      certain that there would be no obstacle to prevent the prince from\n      entering Penguinia.",
                "The pious Agaric organised public meetings so as to keep up the agitation.\n      The Dracophils held one or two every day in some of the thirty-six\n      districts of Alca, and preferably in the poorer quarters. They desired to\n      win over the poor, for they are the most numerous. On the fourth of May a\n      particularly fine meeting was held in an old cattle-market, situated in\n      the centre of a populous suburb filled with housewives sitting on the\n      doorsteps and children playing in the gutters. There were present about\n      two thousand people, in the opinion of the Republicans, and six thousand\n      according to the reckoning of the Dracophils. In the audience was to be\n      seen the flower of Penguin society, including Prince and Princess des\n      Boscenos, Count Clena, M. de La Trumelle, M. Bigourd, and several rich\n      Jewish ladies.",
                "The Generalissimo of the national army had come in uniform. He was\n      cheered.",
                "The committee had been carefully formed. A man of the people, a workman,\n      but a man of sound principles, M. Rauchin, the secretary of the yellow\n      syndicate, was asked to preside, supported by Count Clena and M. Michaud,\n      a butcher.",
                "The government which Penguinia had freely given itself was called by such\n      names as cesspool and drain in several eloquent speeches. But President\n      Formose was spared and no mention was made of Crucho or the priests.",
                "The meeting was not unanimous. A defender of the modern State and of the\n      Republic, a manual labourer, stood up.",
                "\"Gentlemen,\" said M. Rauchin, the chairman, \"we have told you that this\n      meeting would not be unanimous. We are not like our opponents, we are\n      honest men. I allow our opponent to speak. Heaven knows what you are going\n      to hear. Gentlemen, I beg of you to restrain as long as you can the\n      expression of your contempt, your disgust, and your indignation.\"",
                "\"Gentlemen,\" said the opponent. . . .",
                "Immediately he was knocked down, trampled beneath the feet of the\n      indignant crowd, and his unrecognisable remains thrown out of the hall.",
                "The tumult was still resounding when Count Clena ascended the tribune.\n      Cheers took the place of groans and when silence was restored the orator\n      uttered these words:",
                "\"Comrades, we are going to see whether you have blood in your veins. What\n      we have got to do is to slaughter, disembowel, and brain all the\n      Republicans.\"",
                "This speech let loose such a thunder of applause that the old shed rocked\n      with it, and a cloud of acrid and thick dust fell from its filthy walls\n      and worm-eaten beams and enveloped the audience.",
                "A resolution was carried vilifying the government and acclaiming\n      Chatillon. And the audience departed singing the hymn of the liberator:\n      \"It is Chatillon we want.\"",
                "The only way out of the old market was through a muddy alley shut in by\n      omnibus stables and coal sheds. There was no moon and a cold drizzle was\n      coming down. The police, who were assembled in great numbers, blocked the\n      alley and compelled the Dracophils to disperse in little groups. These\n      were the instructions they had received from their chief, who was anxious\n      to check the enthusiasm of the excited crowd.",
                "The Dracophils who were detained in the alley kept marking time and\n      singing, \"It is Chatillon we want.\" Soon, becoming impatient of the delay,\n      the cause of which they did not know, they began to push those in front of\n      them. This movement, propagated along the alley, threw those in front\n      against the broad chests of the police. The latter had no hatred for the\n      Dracophils. In the bottom of their hearts they liked Chatillon. But it is\n      natural to resist aggression and strong men are inclined to make use of\n      their strength. For these reasons the police kicked the Dracophils with\n      their hob-nailed boots. As a result there were sudden rushes backwards and\n      forwards. Threats and cries mingled with the songs.",
                "\"Murder! Murder! . . . It is Chatillon we want! Murder! Murder!\"",
                "And in the gloomy alley the more prudent kept saying, \"Don't push.\" Among\n      these latter, in the darkness, his lofty figure rising above the moving\n      crowd, his broad shoulders and robust body noticeable among the trampled\n      limbs and crushed sides of the rest, stood the Prince des Boscenos, calm,\n      immovable, and placid. Serenely and indulgently he waited. In the mean\n      time, as the exit was opened at regular intervals between the ranks of the\n      police, the pressure of elbows against the chests of those around the\n      prince diminished and people began to breathe again.",
                "\"You see we shall soon be able to go out,\" said that kindly giant, with a\n      pleasant smile. \"Time and patience . . .\"",
                "He took a cigar from his case, raised it to his lips and struck a match.\n      Suddenly, in the light of the match, he saw Princess Anne, his wife,\n      clasped in Count Clena's arms. At this sight he rushed towards them,\n      striking both them and those around with his cane. He was disarmed, though\n      not without difficulty, but he could not be separated from his opponent.\n      And whilst the fainting princess was lifted from arm to arm to her\n      carriage over the excited and curious crowd, the two men still fought\n      furiously. Prince des Boscenos lost his hat, his eye-glass, his cigar, his\n      necktie, and his portfolio full of private letters and political\n      correspondence; he even lost the miraculous medals that he had received\n      from the good Father Cornemuse. But he gave his opponent so terrible a\n      kick in the stomach that the unfortunate Count was knocked through an iron\n      grating and went, head foremost, through a glass door and into a\n      coal-shed.",
                "Attracted by the struggle and the cries of those around, the police rushed\n      towards the prince, who furiously resisted them. He stretched three of\n      them gasping at his feet and put seven others to flight, with,\n      respectively, a broken jaw, a split lip, a nose pouring blood, a fractured\n      skull, a torn ear, a dislocated collar-bone, and broken ribs. He fell,\n      however, and was dragged bleeding and disfigured, with his clothes in\n      rags, to the nearest police-station, where, jumping about and bellowing,\n      he spent the night.",
                "At daybreak groups of demonstrators went about the town singing, \"It is\n      Chatillon we want,\" and breaking the windows of the houses in which the\n      Ministers of the Republic lived."

After having remained isolated from each other for a\n      long time, without help and without support, they had formed themselves\n      into unions. The coffers of the unions were empty, as it was not the habit\n      of the unionists to pay their subscriptions. There were unions numbering\n      thirty thousand members, others with a thousand, five hundred, two\n      hundred, and so forth. Several numbered two or three members only, or even\n      a few less. But as the lists of adherents were not published, it was not\n      easy to distinguish the great unions from the small ones.",
                "After some dark and indirect steps the pious Agaric was put into\n      communication in a room in the Moulin de la Galette, with comrades\n      Dagobert, Tronc, and Balafille, the secretaries of three unions of which\n      the first numbered fourteen members, the second twenty-four, and the third\n      only one.

In front of the legislative palace women\n      passed to market with their baskets; hawkers cried their peaches, pears,\n      and grapes; cab horses with their noses in their bags munched their hay.\n      Nobody expected anything, not because the secret had been kept but because\n      it met with nothing but unbelievers. Nobody believed in a revolution, and\n      from this fact we may conclude that nobody desired one. About two o'clock\n      the deputies began to pass, few and unnoticed, through the side-door of\n      the palace. At three o'clock a few groups of badly dressed men had formed.\n      At half past three black masses coming from the adjacent streets spread\n      over Revolution Square. This vast expanse was soon covered by an ocean of\n      soft hats, and the crowd of demonstrators, continually increased by\n      sight-seers, having crossed the bridge, struck its dark wave against the\n      walls of the legislative enclosure. Cries, murmurs, and songs went up to\n      the impassive sky. \"It is Chatillon we want!\" \"Down with the Deputies!\"\n       \"Down with the Republicans!\" \"Death to the Republicans!\" The devoted band\n      of Dracophils, led by Prince des Boscenos, struck up the august canticle:",

                "This silence and the absence of guards encouraged and at the same time\n      frightened the crowd. Suddenly a formidable voice cried out:",
                "\"Attack!\"",
                "And Prince des Boscenos was seen raising his gigantic form to the top of\n      the wall, which was covered with barbs and iron spikes. Behind him rushed\n      his companions, and the people followed. Some hammered against the wall to\n      make holes in it; others endeavoured to tear down the spikes and to pull\n      out the barbs. These defences had given way in places and some of the\n      invaders had stripped the wall and were sitting astride on the top. Prince\n      des Boscenos was waving an immense green flag. Suddenly the crowd wavered\n      and from it came a long cry of terror. The police and the Republican\n      carabineers issuing out of all the entrances of the palace formed\n      themselves into a column beneath the wall and in a moment it was cleared\n      of its besiegers. After a long moment of suspense the noise of arms was\n      heard, and the police charged the crowd with fixed bayonets. An instant\n      afterwards and on the deserted square strewn with hats and walking-sticks\n      there reigned a sinister silence. Twice again the Dracophils attempted to\n      form, twice they were repulsed. The rising was conquered. But Prince des\n      Boscenos, standing on the wall of the hostile palace, his flag in his\n      hand, still repelled the attack of a whole brigade. He knocked down all\n      who approached him. At last he, too, was thrown down, and fell on an iron\n      spike, to which he remained hooked, still clasping the standard of the\n      Draconides.",
                "On the following day the Ministers of the Republic and the Members of\n      Parliament determined to take energetic measures. In vain, this time, did\n      President Formose attempt to evade his responsibilities. The government\n      discussed the question of depriving Chatillon of his rank and dignities\n      and of indicting him before the High Court as a conspirator, an enemy of\n      the public good, a traitor, etc.",
                "At this news the Emiral's old companions in arms, who the very evening\n      before had beset him with their adulations, made no effort to conceal\n      their joy. But Chatillon remained popular with the middle classes of Alca\n      and one still heard the hymn of the liberator sounding in the streets, \"It\n      is Chatillon we want.\"",
                "The Ministers were embarrassed. They intended to indict Chatillon before\n      the High Court. But they knew nothing; they remained in that total\n      ignorance reserved for those who govern men. They were incapable of\n      advancing any grave charges against Chatillon. They could supply the\n      prosecution with nothing but the ridiculous lies of their spies.\n      Chatillon's share in the plot and his relations with Prince Crucho\n      remained the secret of the thirty thousand Dracophils. The Ministers and\n      the Deputies had suspicions and even certainties, but they had no proofs.\n      The Public Prosecutor said to the Minister of justice: \"Very little is\n      needed for a political prosecution! but I have nothing at all and that is\n      not enough.\" The affair made no progress. The enemies of the Republic were\n      triumphant.",
                "On the eighteenth of September the news ran in Alca that Chatillon had\n      taken flight. Everywhere there was surprise and astonishment. People\n      doubted, for they could not understand.",

                "\"Don't deny it,\" answered Vulcanmould. \"You don't know how to get rid of\n      Chatillon. You do not dare to indict him before the High Court because you\n      are not sure of being able to bring forward a strong enough charge.\n      Bigourd will defend him, and Bigourd is a clever advocate. . . . You are\n      right, M. Barbotan, you are right. It would be a dangerous trial.\"",
                "\"Ah! my friend,\" said the Minister, in a careless tone, \"if you knew how\n      satisfied we are. . . . I receive the most reassuring news from my\n      prefects. The good sense of the Penguins will do justice to the intrigues\n      of this mutinous soldier.

                "The Minister and the Under-Emiral looked at each other for a moment in\n      silence. Then Barbotan said with authority:",
                "\"Under-Emiral Vulcanmould, get rid of this seditious soldier. You will\n      render a great service to Penguinia, and the Minister of Home Affairs will\n      see that your gambling debts are paid.\"",

                "Preceded by the black flag of misery and the red flag of revolt,\n      deputations of workmen walked in the procession, their aspect one of grim\n      protection.",
                "President, Ministers, Deputies, officials, heads of the magistracy and of\n      the army, each, in their own names and in the name of the sovereign\n      people, renewed the ancient oath to live in freedom or to die. It was an\n      alternative upon which they were resolutely determined. But they preferred\n      to live in freedom. There were games, speeches, and songs.",

Prince des Boscenos was quietly smoking a cigar in the\n      Queen's Meadow when the State procession passed by. The prince approached\n      the Minister's carriage and said in a loud voice: \"Death to the\n      Republicans!\" He was immediately apprehended by the police, to whom he\n      offered a most desperate resistance. He knocked them down in crowds, but\n      he was conquered by numbers, and, bruised, scratched, swollen, and\n      unrecognisable even to the eyes of his wife, he was dragged through the\n      joyous streets into an obscure prison.",
                "The magistrates carried on the case against Chatillon in a peculiar style.\n      Letters were found at the Admiralty which revealed the complicity of the\n      Reverend Father Agaric in the plot. Immediately public opinion was\n      inflamed against the monks, and Parliament voted, one after the other, a\n      dozen laws which restrained, diminished, limited, prescribed, suppressed,\n      determined, and curtailed, their rights, immunities, exemptions,\n      privileges, and benefits, and created many invalidating disqualifications\n      against them.",
                "The Reverend Father Agaric steadfastly endured the rigour of the laws\n      which struck himself personally, as well as the terrible fall of the\n      Emiral of which he was the chief cause. Far from yielding to evil fortune,\n      he regarded it as but a bird of passage. He was planning new political\n      designs more audacious than the first.",

A thrush sang in a tree and a little hedgehog crossed the stony\n      path in front of him with awkward steps. Agaric walked with great strides,\n      muttering fragments of sentences to himself.",
                "When he reached the door of the laboratory in which, for so many years,\n      the pious manufacturer bad distilled the golden liqueur of St. Orberosia,\n      he found the place deserted and the door shut. Having walked around the\n      building he saw in the backyard the venerable Cornemuse, who, with his\n      habit pinned up, was climbing a ladder that leant against the wall.",

                "The red pupils of his eyes no longer imitated the triumph and brilliance\n      of the ruby, they flashed mournful and troubled glances. His countenance\n      had lost its happy fulness. His shining head was no longer pleasant to the\n      sight; perspiration and inflamed blotches bad altered its inestimable\n      perfection.",

You see the consequences of your plot.\n      Although a multitude of laws are directed against me I have managed to\n      elude the greater number of them. Some, however, have struck me. These\n      vindictive men have closed my laboratories and my shops, and confiscated\n      my bottles, my stills, and my retorts. They have put seals on my doors and\n      now I am compelled to go in through the window. I am barely able to\n      extract in secret and from time to time the juice of a few plants and that\n      with an apparatus which the humblest labourer would despise.\"",

                "\"Our defeat is only momentary,\" replied Agaric eagerly. \"It is due to\n      purely accidental causes; it results from mere contingencies. Chatillon\n      was a fool; he has drowned himself in his own ineptitude. Listen to me,\n      Brother Cornemuse. We have not a moment to lose. We must free the Penguin\n      people, we must deliver them from their tyrants, save them from\n      themselves, restore the Dragon's crest, reestablish the ancient State, the\n      good State, for the honour of religion and the exaltation of the Catholic\n      faith. Chatillon was a bad instrument; he broke in our hands. Let us take\n      a better instrument to replace him. I have the man who will destroy this\n      impious democracy.

                "All Penguinia heard with horror of Pyrot's crime; at the same time there\n      was a sort of satisfaction that this embezzlement combined with treachery\n      and even bordering on sacrilege, had been committed by a Jew. In order to\n      understand this feeling it is necessary to be acquainted with the state of\n      public opinion regarding the Jews both great and small. As we have had\n      occasion to say in this history, the universally detested and all powerful\n      financial caste was composed of Christians and of Jews. The Jews who\n      formed part of it and on whom the people poured all their hatred were the\n      upper-class Jews. They possessed immense riches and, it was said, held\n      more than a fifth part of the total property of Penguinia. Outside this\n      formidable caste there was a multitude of Jews of a mediocre condition,\n      who were not more loved than the others and who were feared much less. In\n      every ordered State, wealth is a sacred thing: in democracies it is the\n      only sacred thing. Now the Penguin State was democratic. Three or four\n      financial companies exercised a more extensive, and above all, more\n      effective and continuous power, than that of the Ministers of the\n      Republic. The latter were puppets whom the companies ruled in secret, whom\n      they compelled by intimidation or corruption to favour themselves at the\n      expense of the State, and whom they ruined by calumnies in the press if\n      they remained honest. In spite of the secrecy of the Exchequer, enough\n      appeared to make the country indignant, but the middle-class Penguins had,\n      from the greatest to the least of them, been brought up to hold money in\n      great reverence, and as they all had property, either much or little, they\n      were strongly impressed with the solidarity of capital and understood that\n      a small fortune is not safe unless a big one is protected. For these\n      reasons they conceived a religious respect for the Jews' millions, and\n      self-interest being stronger with them than aversion, they were as much\n      afraid as they were of death to touch a single hair of one of the rich\n      Jews whom they detested. Towards the poorer Jews they felt less\n      ceremonious and when they saw any of them down they trampled on them. That\n      is why the entire nation learnt with thorough satisfaction that the\n      traitor was a Jew. They could take vengeance on all Israel in his person\n      without any fear of compromising the public credit.",
                "That Pyrot had stolen the eighty thousand trusses of hay nobody hesitated\n      for a moment to believe. No one doubted because the general ignorance in\n      which everybody was concerning the affair did not allow of doubt, for\n      doubt is a thing that demands motives. People do not doubt without reasons\n      in the same way that people believe without reasons. The thing was not\n      doubted because it was repeated everywhere and, with the public, to repeat\n      is to prove. It was not doubted because people wished to believe Pyrot\n      guilty and one believes what one wishes to believe. Finally, it was not\n      doubted because the faculty of doubt is rare amongst men; very few minds\n      carry in them its germs and these are not developed without cultivation.\n      Doubt is singular, exquisite, philosophic, immoral, transcendent,\n      monstrous, full of malignity, injurious to persons and to property,\n      contrary to the good order of governments, and to the prosperity of\n      empires, fatal to humanity, destructive of the gods, held in horror by\n      heaven and earth. The mass of the Penguins were ignorant of doubt: it\n      believed in Pyrot's guilt and this conviction immediately became one of\n      its chief national beliefs and an essential truth in its patriotic creed.",
                "Pyrot was tried secretly and condemned.",
                "General Panther immediately went to the Minister of War to tell him the\n      result.",
                "\"Luckily,\" said he, \"the judges were certain, for they had no proofs.\"",
                "\"Proofs,\" muttered Greatauk, \"Proofs, what do they prove? There is only\n      one certain, irrefragable proof -- the confession of the guilty person.\n      Has Pyrot confessed?\"",
                "\"No, General.\"",
                "\"He will confess, he ought to. Panther, we must induce him; tell him it is\n      to his interest. Promise him that, if he confesses, he will obtain\n      favours, a reduction of his sentence, full pardon; promise him that if he\n      confesses his innocence will be admitted, that he will be decorated.\n      Appeal to his good feelings. Let him confess from patriotism, for the\n      flag, for the sake of order, from respect for the hierarchy, at the\n      special command of the Minister of War militarily. . . . But tell me,\n      Panther, has he not confessed already? There are tacit confessions;\n      silence is a confession.\"",
                "\"But, General, he is not silent; he keeps on squealing like a pig that he\n      is innocent.\"",
                "\"Panther, the confessions of a guilty man sometimes result from the\n      vehemence of his denials. To deny desperately is to confess. Pyrot has\n      confessed; we must have witnesses of his confessions, justice requires\n      them.\"",
                "There was in Western Penguinia a seaport called La Cirque, formed of three\n      small bays and formerly greatly frequented by ships, but now solitary and\n      deserted. Gloomy lagoons stretched along its low coasts exhaling a\n      pestilent odour, while fever hovered over its sleepy waters. Here, on the\n      borders of the sea, there was built a high square tower, like the old\n      Campanile at Venice, from the side of which, close to the summit hung an\n      open cage which was fastened by a chain to a transverse beam. In the times\n      of the Draconides the Inquisitors of Alca used to put heretical clergy\n      into this cage. It had been empty for three hundred years, but now Pirot\n      was imprisoned in it under the guard of sixty warders, who lived in the\n      tower and did not lose sight of him night or day, spying on him for\n      confessions that they might afterwards report to the Minister of War. For\n      Greatauk, careful and prudent, desired confessions and still further\n      confessions. Greatauk, who was looked upon as a fool, was in reality a man\n      of great ability and full of rare foresight.",
                "In the mean time Pyrot, burnt by the sun, eaten by mosquitoes, soaked in\n      the rain, hail and snow, frozen by the cold, tossed about terribly by the\n      wind, beset by the sinister croaking of the ravens that perched upon his\n      cage, kept writing down his innocence on pieces torn off his shirt with a\n      tooth-pick dipped in blood. These rags were lost in the sea or fell into\n      the hands of the gaolers. But Pyrot's protests moved nobody because his\n      confessions had been published."

                "III. COUNT DE MAUBEC DE LA DENTDULYNX",
                "The morals of the Jews were not always pure; in most cases they were\n      averse from none of the vices of Christian civilization, but they retained\n      from the Patriarchal age a recognition of family, ties and an attachment\n      to the interests of the tribe. Pyrot's brothers, half-brothers, uncles,\n      great-uncles, first, second, and third cousins, nephews and great-nephews,\n      relations by blood and relations by marriage, and all who were related to\n      him to the number of about seven hundred, were at first overwhelmed by the\n      blow that had struck their relative, and they shut themselves up in their\n      houses, covering themselves with ashes and blessing the hand that had\n      chastised them. For forty days they kept a strict fast. Then they bathed\n      themselves and resolved to search, without rest, at the cost of any toil\n      and at the risk of eve danger, for the demonstration of an innocence which\n      they did not doubt. And how could they have doubted? Pyrot's innocence had\n      been revealed to them in the same way that his guilt had been revealed to\n      Christian Penguinia's; for these things, being hidden, assume a mystic\n      character and take on the authority of religious truths. The seven hundred\n      Pyrotists set to work with as much zeal as prudence, and made the most\n      thorough inquiries in secret. They were everywhere; they were seen\n      nowhere. One would have said that, like the pilot of Ulysses, they\n      wandered freely over the earth. They penetrated into the War Office and\n      approached, under different disguises, the judges, the registrars, and the\n      witnesses of the affair. Then Greatauk's cleverness was seen. The\n      witnesses knew nothing; the judges and registrars knew nothing. Emissaries\n      reached even Pyrot and anxiously questioned him in his cage amid the\n      prolonged moanings of the sea and the hoarse croaks of the ravens. It was\n      in vain; the prisoner knew nothing. The seven hundred Pyrotists could not\n      subvert the proofs of the accusation because they could not know what they\n      were, and they could not know what they were because there were none.\n      Pyrot's guilt was indefeasible through its very nullity. And it was with a\n      legitimate pride that Greatauk, expressing himself as a true artist, said\n      one day to General Panther: \"This case is a master-piece: it is made out\n      of nothing.\" The seven hundred Pyrotists despaired of ever clearing up\n      this dark business, when suddenly they discovered, from a stolen letter,\n      that the eighty thousand trusses of hay had never existed, that a most\n      distinguished nobleman, Count de Maubec, had sold them to the State, that\n      he had received the price but had never delivered them. Indeed seeing that\n      he was descended from the richest landed proprietors of ancient Penguinia,\n      the heir of the Maubecs of Dentdulynx, once the possessors of four\n      duchies, sixty counties, and six hundred and twelve marquisates, baronies,\n      and viscounties, he did not possess as much land as he could cover with\n      his hand, and would not have been able to cut a single day's mowing of\n      forage off his own domains. As to his getting a single rush from a\n      land-owner or a merchant, that would have been quite impossible, for\n      everybody except the Ministers of State and the Government officials knew\n      that it would be easier to get blood from a stone than a farthing from a\n      Maubec.",
                "The seven hundred Pyrotists made a minute inquiry concerning the Count\n      Maubec de la Dentdulynx's financial resources, and they proved that that\n      nobleman was chiefly supported by a house in which some generous ladies\n      were ready to furnish all comers with the most lavish hospitality. They\n      publicly proclaimed that he was guilty of the theft of the eighty thousand\n      trusses of straw for which an innocent man had been condemned and was now\n      imprisoned in the cage.",
                "Maubec belonged to an illustrious family which was allied to the\n      Draconides. There is nothing that a democracy esteems more highly than\n      noble birth. Maubec had also served in the Penguin army, and since the\n      Penguins were all soldiers, they loved their army to idolatry. Maubec, on\n      the field of battle, had received the Cross, which is a sign of honour\n      among the Penguins and which they valued even more highly than the\n      embraces of their wives. All Penguinia declared for Maubec, and the voice\n      of the people which began to assume a threatening tone, demanded severe\n      punishments for the seven hundred calumniating Pyrotists.",
                "Maubec was a nobleman; he challenged the seven hundred Pyrotists to combat\n      with either sword, sabre, pistols, carabines, or sticks.",
                "\"Vile dogs,\" he wrote to them in a famous letter, \"you have crucified my\n      God and you want my life too; I warn you that I will not be such a duffer\n      as He was and that I will cut off your fourteen hundred ears. Accept my\n      boot on your seven hundred behinds.\"",
                "The Chief of the Government at the time was a peasant called Robin\n      Mielleux, a man pleasant to the rich and powerful, but hard towards the\n      poor, a man of small courage and ignorant of his own interests. In a\n      public declaration he guaranteed Maubec's innocence and honour, and\n      presented the seven hundred Pyrotists: to the criminal courts where they\n      were condemned, as libellers, to imprisonment, to enormous fines, and to\n      all the damages that were claimed by their innocent victim.",
                "It seemed as if Pyrot was destined to remain for ever shut in the cage on\n      which the ravens perched. But all the Penguins being anxious to know and\n      prove that this Jew was guilty, all the proofs brought forward were found\n      not to be good, while some of them were also contradictory. The officers\n      of the Staff showed zeal but lacked prudence. Whilst Greatauk kept an\n      admirable silence, General Panther made inexhaustible speeches and every\n      morning demonstrated in the newspapers that the condemned man was guilty.\n      He would have done better, perhaps, if he had said nothing. The guilt was\n      evident and what is evident cannot be demonstrated. So much reasoning\n      disturbed people's minds; their faith, though still alive, became less\n      serene. The more proofs one gives a crowd the more they ask for.",
                "Nevertheless the danger of proving too much would not have been great if\n      there had not been in Penguinia, as there are, indeed, everywhere, minds\n      framed for free inquiry, capable of studying a difficult question, and\n      inclined to philosophic doubt. They were few; they were not all inclined\n      to speak, and the public was by no means inclined to listen to them.\n      Still, they did not always meet with deaf ears. The great Jews, all the\n      Israelite millionaires of Alca, when spoken to of Pyrot, said: \"We do not\n      know the man\"; but they thought of saving him. They preserved the prudence\n      to which their wealth inclined them and wished that others would be less\n      timid. Their wish was to be gratified."

                "Some weeks after the conviction of the seven hundred Pyrotists, a little,\n      gruff, hairy, short-sighted man left his house one morning with a\n      paste-pot, a ladder, and a bundle of posters and went about the streets\n      pasting placards to the walls on which might be read in large letters:\n      Pyrot is innocent, Maubec is guilty. He was not a bill-poster; his name\n      was Colomban, and as the author of sixty volumes on Penguin sociology he\n      was numbered among the most laborious and respected writers in Alca.\n      Having given sufficient thought to the matter and no longer doubting\n      Pyrot's innocence, he proclaimed it in the manner which he thought would\n      be most sensational. He met with no hindrance while posting his bills in\n      the quiet streets, but when he came to the populous quarters, every time\n      he mounted his ladder, inquisitive people crowded round him and,\n      dumbfounded with surprise and indignation, threw at him threatening looks\n      which he received with the calm that comes from courage and\n      short-sightedness. Whilst caretakers and tradespeople tore down the bills\n      he had posted, he kept on zealously placarding, carrying his tools and\n      followed by little boys who, with their baskets under their arms or their\n      satchels on their backs, were in no hurry to reach school. To the mute\n      indignation against him, protests and murmurs were now added. But Colomban\n      did not condescend to see or hear anything. As, at the entrance to the Rue\n      St. Orberosia, he was posting one of his squares of paper bearing the\n      words: Pyrot is innocent, Maubec is guilty, the riotous crowd showed signs\n      of the most violent anger. They called after him, \"Traitor, thief, rascal,\n      scoundrel.\" A woman opened a window and emptied a vase full of filth over\n      his head, a cabby sent his hat flying from one end of the street to the\n      other by a blow of his whip amid the cheers of the crowd who now felt\n      themselves avenged. A butcher's boy knocked Colomban with his paste-pot,\n      his brush, and his posters, from the top of his ladder into the gutter,\n      and the proud Penguins then felt the greatness of their country. Colomban\n      stood up, covered with filth, lame, and with his elbow injured, but\n      tranquil and resolute.",
                "\"Low brutes,\" he muttered, shrugging his shoulders.",
                "Then he went down on all-fours in the gutter to look for his glasses which\n      he had lost in his fall. It was then seen that his coat was split from the\n      collar to the tails and that his trousers were in rags. The rancour of the\n      crowd grew stronger.",
                "On the other side of the street stretched the big St. Orberosian Stores.\n      The patriots seized whatever they could lay their hands on from the shop\n      front, and hurled at Colomban oranges, lemons, pots of jam, pieces of\n      chocolate, bottles of liqueurs, boxes of sardines, pots of foie gras,\n      hams, fowls, flasks of oil, and bags of haricots. Covered with the debris\n      of the food, bruised, tattered, lame, and blind, he took to flight,\n      followed by the shop-boys, bakers, loafers, citizens, and hooligans whose\n      number increased each moment and who kept shouting: \"Duck him! Death to\n      the traitor! Duck him!\" This torrent of vulgar humanity swept along the\n      streets and rushed into the Rue St. Mael. The police did their duty. From\n      all the adjacent streets constables proceeded and, holding their scabbards\n      with their left hands, they went at full speed in front of the pursuers.\n      They were on the point of grabbing Colomban in their huge hands when he\n      suddenly escaped them by falling through an open man-hole to the bottom of\n      a sewer.",
                "He spent the night there in the darkness, sitting close by the dirty water\n      amidst the fat and slimy rats. He thought of his task, and his swelling\n      heart filled with courage and pity. And when the dawn threw a pale ray of\n      light into the air-hole he got up and said, speaking to himself:",
                "\"I see that the fight will be a stiff one.\"",
                "Forthwith he composed a memorandum in which he clearly showed that Pyrot\n      could not have stolen from the Ministry of War the eighty thousand trusses\n      of hay which it had never received, for the reason that Maubec had never\n      delivered them, though he had received the money. Colomban caused this\n      statement to be distributed in the streets of Alca. The people refused to\n      read it and tore it up in anger. The shop-keepers shook their fists at the\n      distributers, who made off, chased by angry women armed with brooms.\n      Feelings grew warm and the ferment lasted the whole day. In the evening\n      bands of wild and ragged men went about the streets yelling: \"Death to\n      Colomban!\" The patriots snatched whole bundles of the memorandum from the\n      newsboys and burned them in the public squares, dancing wildly round these\n      bon-fires with girls whose petticoats were tied up to their waists.",
                "Some of the more enthusiastic among them went and broke the windows of the\n      house in which Colomban had lived in perfect tranquillity during his forty\n      years of work.",
                "Parliament was roused and asked the Chief of the Government what measures\n      he proposed to take in order to repel the odious attacks made by Colomban\n      upon the honour of the National Arm and the safety of Penguinia. Robin\n      Mielleux denounced Colomban's impious audacity and proclaimed amid the\n      cheers of the legislators that the man would be summoned before the Courts\n      to answer for his infamous libel.",
                "The Minister of War was called to the tribune and appeared in it\n      transfigured. He had no longer the air, as in former days, of one of the\n      sacred geese of the Penguin citadels. Now, bristling, with outstretched\n      neck and hooked beak, he seemed the symbolical vulture fastened to the\n      livers of his country's enemies.",

                "Colomban bore with meekness and surprise the weight of the general\n      reprobation. He could not go out without being stoned, so he did not go\n      out. He remained in his study with a superb obstinacy, writing new\n      memoranda in favour of the encaged innocent. In the mean time among the\n      few readers that he found, some, about a dozen, were struck by his reasons\n      and began to doubt Pyrot's guilt. They broached the subject to their\n      friends and endeavoured to spread the light that had arisen in their\n      minds. One of them was a friend of Robin Mielleux and confided to him his\n      perplexities, with the result that he was no longer received by that\n      Minister. Another demanded explanations in an open letter to the Minister\n      of War. A third published a terrible pamphlet. The latter, whose name was\n      Kerdanic, was a formidable controversialist. The public was unmoved. It\n      was said that these defenders of the traitor had been bribed by the rich\n      Jews; they were stigmatized by the name of Pyrotists and the patriots\n      swore to exterminate them. There were only a thousand or twelve hundred\n      Pyrotists in the whole vast Republic, but it was believed that they were\n      everywhere. People were afraid of finding them in the promenades, at\n      meetings, at receptions, in fashionable drawing-rooms, at the\n      dinner-table, even in the conjugal couch. One half of the population was\n      suspected by the other half. The discord set all Alca on fire.",
                "In the mean time Father Agaric, who managed his big school for young\n      nobles, followed events with anxious attention. The misfortunes of the\n      Penguin Church had not disheartened him. He remained faithful to Prince\n      Crucho and preserved the hope of restoring the heir of the Draconides to\n      the Penguin throne. It appeared to him that the events that were happening\n      or about to happen in the country, the state of mind of which they were at\n      once the effect and the cause, and the troubles that necessarily resulted\n      from them might -- if they were directed, guided, and led by the\n      profound wisdom of a monk -- overthrow the Republic and incline the\n      Penguins to restore Prince Crucho, from whose piety the faithful hoped for\n      so much solace. Wearing his huge black hat, the brims of which looked like\n      the wings of Night, he walked through the Wood of Conils towards the\n      factory where his venerable friend, Father Cornemuse, distilled the\n      hygienic St. Orberosian liqueur, The good monk's industry, so cruelly\n      affected in the time of Emiral Chatillon, was being restored from its\n      ruins. One heard goods trains rumbling through the Wood and one saw in the\n      sheds hundreds of orphans clothed in blue, packing bottles and nailing up\n      cases.",
                "Agaric found the venerable Cornemuse standing before his stoves and\n      surrounded by his retorts. The shining pupils of the old man's eyes had\n      again become as rubies, his skull shone with its former elaborate and\n      careful polish.",
                "Agaric first congratulated the pious distiller on the restored activity of\n      his laboratories and workshops.",
                "\"Business is recovering. I thank God for it,\" answered the old man of\n      Conils. \"Alas! it had fallen into a bad state, Brother Agaric. You raw the\n      desolation of this establishment. I need say no more.\"",
                "Agaric turned away his head.",
                "\"The St. Orberosian liqueur,\" continued Cornemuse, \"is making fresh\n      conquests. But none the less my industry remains uncertain and precarious.\n      The laws of ruin and desolation that struck it have not been abrogated,\n      they have only been suspended.\"",
                "And the monk of Conils lifted his ruby eyes to heaven.",
                "Agaric put his hand on his shoulder.",
                "\"What a sight, Cornemuse, does unhappy Penguinia present to us! Everywhere\n      disobedience, independence, liberty! We seethe proud, the haughty, the men\n      of revolt rising up. After having braved the Divine laws they now rear\n      themselves against human laws, so true is it that in order to be a good\n      citizen a man must be a good Christian. Colomban is trying to imitate\n      Satan. Numerous criminals are following his fatal example. They want, in\n      their rage, to put aside all checks, to throw off all yokes, to free\n      themselves from the most sacred bonds, to escape from the most salutary\n      restraints. They strike their country to make it obey them. But they will\n      be overcome by the weight of public animadversion, vituperation,\n      indignation, fury, execration, and abomination. That is the abyss to which\n      they have been led by atheism, free thought, and the monstrous claim to\n      judge for themselves and to form their own opinions.\"",
                "\"Doubtless, doubtless,\" replied Father Cornemuse, shaking his head, \"but I\n      confess that the care of distilling these simples has prevented me from\n      following public affairs. I only know that people are talking a great deal\n      about a man called Pyrot. Some maintain that he is guilty, others affirm\n      that he is innocent, but I do not clearly understand the motives that\n      drive both parties to mix themselves up in a business that concerns\n      neither of them.\"",

                "\"You do not doubt Pyrot's guilt?\"",
                "\"I cannot doubt it, dear Agaric,\" answered the monk of Conils. \"That would\n      be contrary to the laws of my country which we ought to respect as long as\n      they are not opposed to the Divine laws. Pyrot is guilty, for he has been\n      convicted. As to saying more for or against his guilt, that would be to\n      erect my own authority against that of the judges, a thing which I will\n      take good care not to do. Besides, it is useless, for Pyrot has been\n      convicted. If he has not been convicted because he is guilty, he is guilty\n      because he has been convicted; it comes to the same thing. I believe in\n      his guilt as every good citizen ought to believe in it; and I will believe\n      in it as long as the established jurisdiction will order me to believe in\n      it, for it is not for a private person but for a judge to proclaim the\n      innocence of a convicted person. Human justice is venerable even in the\n      errors inherent in its fallible and limited nature. These errors are never\n      irreparable; if the judges do not repair them on earth, God will repair\n      them in Heaven. Besides I have great confidence in general Greatauk, who,\n      though he certainly does not look it, seems to me to be an abler man than\n      all those who are attacking him.\"",
                "\"Dearest Cornemuse,\" cried the pious Agaric, \"the Pyrot affair, if pushed\n      to the point whither we can lead it by the help of God and the necessary\n      funds, will produce the greatest benefits. It will lay bare the vices of\n      this Anti-Christian Republic and will incline the Penguins to restore the\n      throne of the Draconides and the prerogatives of the Church. But to do\n      that it is necessary for the people to see the clergy in the front rank of\n      its defenders. Let us march against the enemies of the army, against those\n      who insult our heroes, and everybody will follow us.\"",
                "\"Everybody will be too many,\" murmured the monk of Conils, shaking his\n      head. \"I see that the Penguins want to quarrel. If we mix ourselves up in\n      their quarrel they will become reconciled at our expense and we shall have\n      to pay the cost of the war. That is why, if you are guided by me, dear\n      Agaric, you will not engage the Church in this adventure.\"",
                "\"You know my energy; you know my prudence. I will compromise nothing. . .\n      . Dear Cornemuse, I only want from you the funds necessary for us to begin\n      the campaign.\"",
                "For a long time Cornemuse refused to bear the expenses of what he thought\n      was a fatal enterprise. Agaric was in turn pathetic and terrible. At last,\n      yielding to his prayers and threats, Cornemuse, with banging head and\n      swinging arms, went to the austere cell that concealed his evangelical\n      poverty. In the whitewashed wall under a branch of blessed box, there was\n      fixed a safe. He opened it, and with a sigh took out a bundle of bills\n      which, with hesitating hands, he gave to the pious Agaric.",
                "\"Do not doubt it, dear Cornemuse,\" said the latter, thrusting the papers\n      into the pocket of his overcoat, \"this Pyrot affair has been sent us by\n      God for the glory and exaltation of the Church of Penguinia.\"",
                "\"I pray that you may be right!\" sighed the monk of Conils.",
                "And, left alone in his laboratory, he gazed, through his exquisite eyes,\n      with an ineffable sadness at his stoves and his retorts."

                "VI. THE SEVEN HUNDRED PYROTISTS",
                "The seven hundred Pyrotists inspired the public with an increasing\n      aversion. Every day two or three of them were beaten to death in the\n      streets. One of them was publicly whipped, another thrown into the river,\n      a third tarred and feathered and led through a laughing crowd, a fourth\n      had his nose cut off by a captain of dragoons. They did not dare to show\n      themselves at their clubs, at tennis, or at the races; they put on a\n      disguise when they went to the Stock Exchange. In these circumstances the\n      Prince des Boscenos thought it urgent to curb their audacity and repress\n      their insolence. For this purpose he joined with Count Clena, M. de La\n      Trumelle, Viscount Olive, and M. Bigourd in founding a great anti-Pyrotist\n      association to which citizens in hundreds of thousands, soldiers in\n      companies, regiments, brigades, divisions, and army corps, towns,\n      districts, and provinces, all gave their adhesion.",
                "About this time the Minister of War happening to visit one day his Chief\n      of Staff, saw with surprise that the large room where General Panther\n      worked, which was formerly quite bare, had now along each wall from floor\n      to ceiling in sets of deep pigeon-holes, triple and quadruple rows of\n      paper bundles of every as form and colour. These sudden and monstrous\n      records had in a few days reached the dimensions of a pile of archives\n      such as it takes centuries to accumulate.",
                "\"What is this?\" asked the astonished minister.",
                "\"Proofs against Pyrot,\" answered General Panther with patriotic\n      satisfaction. \"We had not got them when we convicted him, but we have\n      plenty of them now.\"",
                "The door was open, and Greatauk saw coming up the stair-case a long file\n      of porters who were unloading heavy bales of papers in the hall, and he\n      saw the lift slowly rising heavily loaded with paper packets.",
                "\"What are those others?\" said he.",
                "\"They are fresh proofs against Pyrot that are now reaching us,\" said\n      Panther. \"I have asked for them in every county of Penguinia, in every\n      Staff Office and in every Court in Europe. I have ordered them in every\n      town in America and in Australia, and in every factory in Africa, and I am\n      expecting bales of them from Bremen and a ship-load from Melbourne.\" And\n      Panther turned towards the Minister of War the tranquil and radiant look\n      of a hero. However, Greatauk, his eye-glass in his eye, was looking at the\n      formidable pile of papers with less satisfaction than uneasiness.",
                "\"Very good,\" said he, \"very good! but I am afraid that this Pyrot business\n      may lose its beautiful simplicity. It was limpid; like a rock-crystal its\n      value lay in its transparency. You could have searched it in vain with a\n      magnifying-glass for a straw, a bend, a blot, for the least fault. When it\n      left my hands it was as pure as the light. Indeed it was the light. I give\n      you a pearl and you make a mountain out of it. To tell you the truth I am\n      afraid that by wishing to do too well you have done less well. Proofs! of\n      course it is good to have proofs, but perhaps it is better to have none at\n      all. I have already told you, Panther, there is only one irrefutable\n      proof, the confession of the guilty person (or if the innocent what\n      matter!). The Pyrot affair, as I arranged it, left no room for criticism;\n      there was no spot where it could be touched. It defied assault. It was\n      invulnerable because it was invisible. Now it gives an enormous handle for\n      discussion. I advise you, Panther, to use your paper packets with great\n      reserve. I should be particularly grateful if you would be more sparing of\n      your communications to journalists. You speak well, but you say too much.\n      Tell me, Panther, are there any forged documents among these?\"",
                "\"There are some adapted ones.\"",
                "\"That is what I meant. There are some adapted ones. So much the better. As\n      proofs, forged documents, in general, are better than genuine ones, first\n      of all because they have been expressly made to suit the needs of the\n      case, to order and measure, and therefore they are fitting and exact. They\n      are also preferable because they carry the mind into an ideal world and\n      turn it aside from the reality which, alas! in this world is never without\n      some alloy. . . . Nevertheless, I think I should have preferred, Panther,\n      that we had no proofs at all.\"",
                "The first act of the Anti-Pyrotist Association was to ask the Government\n      immediately to summon the seven hundred Pyrotists and their accomplices\n      before the High Court of Justice as guilty of high treason. Prince des\n      Boscenos was charged to speak on behalf of the Association and presented\n      himself before the Council which had assembled to hear him. He expressed a\n      hope that the vigilance and firmness of the Government would rise to the\n      height of the occasion. He shook hands with each of the ministers and as\n      he passed General Greatauk he whispered in his ear:",
                "\"Behave properly, you ruffian, or I will publish the Maloury dossier!\"",
                "Some days later by a unanimous vote of both Houses, on a motion proposed\n      by the Government, the Anti-Pyrotist Association was granted a charter\n      recognising it as beneficial to the public interest.",
                "The Association immediately sent a deputation to Chitterlings Castle in\n      Porpoisia, where Crucho was eating the bitter bread of exile, to assure\n      the prince of the love and devotion of the Anti-Pyrotist members.",
                "However, the Pyrotists grew in numbers, and now counted ten thousand. They\n      had their regular cafes on the boulevards. The patriots had theirs also,\n      richer and bigger, and every evening glasses of beer, saucers,\n      match-stands, jugs, chairs, and tables were hurled from one to the other.\n      Mirrors were smashed to bits, and the police ended the struggles by\n      impartially trampling the combatants of both parties under their\n      hob-nailed shoes.",
                "On one of these glorious nights, as Prince des Boscenos was leaving a\n      fashionable cafe in the company of some patriots, M. de La Trumelle\n      pointed out to him a little, bearded man with glasses, hatless, and having\n      only one sleeve to his coat, who was painfully dragging himself along the\n      rubbish-strewn pavement.",
                "\"Look!\" said he, \"there is Colomban!\"",
                "The prince had gentleness as well as strength; he was exceedingly mild;\n      but at the name of Colomban his blood boiled. He rushed at the little\n      spectacled man, and knocked him down with one blow of his fist on the\n      nose.",
                "M. de La Trumelle then perceived that, misled by an undeserved\n      resemblance, he had mistaken for Colomban, M. Bazile, a retired lawyer,\n      the secretary of the Anti-pyrotist Association, and an ardent and generous\n      patriot. Prince des Boscenos was one of those antique souls who never\n      bend. However, he knew how to recognise his faults.",
                "\"M. Bazile,\" said he, raising his hat, \"if I have touched your face with\n      my hand you will excuse me and you will understand me, you will approve of\n      me, nay, you will compliment me, you will congratulate me and felicitate\n      me, when you know the cause of that act. I took you for Colomban.\"",
                "M. Bazile, wiping his bleeding nostrils with his handkerchief and\n      displaying an elbow laid bare by the absence of his sleeve:",
                "\"No, sir,\" answered he drily, \"I shall not felicitate you, I shall not\n      congratulate you, I shall not compliment you, for your action was, at the\n      very least, superfluous; it was, I will even say, supererogatory. Already\n      this evening I have been three times mistaken for Colomban and received a\n      sufficient amount of the treatment he deserves. The patriots have knocked\n      in my ribs and broken my back, and, sir, I was of opinion that that was\n      enough.\"",
                "Scarcely had he finished this speech than a band of Pyrotists appeared,\n      and misled in their turn by that insidious resemblance, they believed that\n      the patriots were killing Colomban. They fell on Prince des Boscenos and\n      his companions with loaded canes and leather thongs, and left them for\n      dead. Then seizing Bazile they carried him in triumph, and in spite of his\n      protests, along the boulevards, amid cries of: \"Hurrah for Colomban!\n      Hurrah for Pyrot!\" At last the police, who had been sent after them,\n      attacked and defeated them and dragged them ignominiously to the station,\n      where Bazile, under the name of Colomban, was trampled on by an\n      innumerable quantity of thick, hob-nailed shoes."

                "Whilst the wind of anger and hatred blew in Alca, Eugine Bidault-Coquille,\n      poorest and happiest of astronomers, installed in an old steam-engine of\n      the time of the Draconides, was observing the heavens through a bad\n      telescope, and photographing the paths of the meteors upon some damaged\n      photographic plates. His genius corrected the errors of his instruments\n      and his love of science triumphed over the worthlessness of his apparatus.\n      With an inextinguishable ardour he observed aerolites, meteors, and\n      fire-balls, and all the glowing ruins and blazing sparks which pass\n      through the terrestrial atmosphere with prodigious speed, and as a reward\n      for is studious vigils he received the indifference of the public, the\n      ingratitude of the State and the blame of the learned societies. Engulfed\n      in the celestial spaces he knew not what occurred upon the surface of the\n      earth. He never read the newspapers, and when he walked through the town\n      his mind was occupied with the November asteroids, and more than once he\n      found himself at the bottom of a pond in one of the public parks or\n      beneath the wheels of a motor omnibus.",
                "Elevated in stature as in thought he respected himself and others. This\n      was shown by his cold politeness as well as by a very thin black frock\n      coat and a tall hat which gave to his person an appearance at once\n      emaciated and sublime. He took his meals in a little restaurant from which\n      all customers less intellectual than himself had fled, and thenceforth his\n      napkin bound by its wooden ring rested alone in the abandoned rack.",
                "In this cook-shop his eyes fell one evening upon Colomban's memorandum in\n      favour of Pyrot. He read it as he was cracking some bad nuts and suddenly,\n      exalted with astonishment, admiration, horror, and pity, he forgot all\n      about falling meteors and shooting stars and saw nothing but the innocent\n      man hanging in his cage exposed to the winds of heaven and the ravens\n      perching upon it.",
                "That image did not leave him. For a week he had been obsessed by the\n      innocent convict, when, as he was leaving his cook-shop, he saw a crowd of\n      citizens entering a public-house in which a public meeting was going on.\n      He went in. The meeting was disorderly; they were yelling, abusing one\n      another and knocking one another down in the smoke-laden hall. The\n      Pyrotists and the Anti-Pyrotists spoke in turn and were alternately\n      cheered and hissed at. An obscure and confused enthusiasm moved the\n      audience. With the audacity of a timid and retired man Bidault-Coquille\n      leaped upon the platform and spoke for three-quarters of an hour. He spoke\n      very quickly, without order, but with vehemence, and with all the\n      conviction of a mathematical mystic. He was cheered. When he got down from\n      the platform a big woman of uncertain age, dressed in red, and wearing an\n      immense hat trimmed with heroic feathers, throwing herself into his arms,\n      embraced him, and said to him:",
                "\"You are splendid!\"",
                "He thought in his simplicity that there was some truth in the statement.",
                "She declared to him that henceforth she would live but for Pyrot's defence\n      and Colomban's glory. He thought her sublime and beautiful. She was\n      Maniflore, a poor old courtesan, now forgotten and discarded, who had\n      suddenly become a vehement politician.",
                "She never left him. They spent glorious hours together in doss-houses and\n      in lodgings beautified by their love, in newspaper offices, in\n      meeting-halls and in lecture-halls. As he was an idealist, he persisted in\n      thinking her beautiful, although she gave him abundant opportunity of\n      seeing that she had preserved no charm of any kind. From her past beauty\n      she only retained a confidence in her capacity for pleasing and a lofty\n      assurance in demanding homage. Still, it must be admitted that this Pyrot\n      affair, so fruitful in prodigies, invested Maniflore with a sort of civic\n      majesty, and transformed her, at public meetings, into an august symbol of\n      justice and truth.",
                "Bidault-Coquille and Maniflore did not kindle the least spark of irony or\n      amusement in a single Anti-Pyrotist, a single defender of Greatauk, or a\n      single supporter of the army. The gods, in their anger, had refused to\n      those men the precious gift of humour. They gravely accused the courtesan\n      and the astronomer of being spies, of treachery, and of plotting against\n      their country. Bidault-Coquille and Maniflore grew visibly greater beneath\n      insult, abuse, and calumny.",
                "For long months Penguinia had been divided into two camps and, though at\n      first sight it may appear strange, hitherto the socialists had taken no\n      part in the contest. Their groups comprised almost all the manual workers\n      in the country, necessarily scattered, confused, broken up, and divided,\n      but formidable. The Pyrot affair threw the group leaders into a singular\n      embarrassment. They did not wish to place themselves either on the side of\n      the financiers or on the side of the army. They regarded the Jews, both\n      great and small, as their uncompromising opponents. Their principles were\n      not at stake, nor were their interests concerned in the affair. Still the\n      greater number felt how difficult it was growing for them to remain aloof\n      from struggles in which all Penguinia was engaged.",
                "Their leaders called a sitting of their federation at the Rue de la\n      Queue-du-diable-St. Mael, to take into consideration the conduct they\n      ought to adopt in the present circumstances and in future eventualities.",
                "Comrade Phoenix was the first to speak.",
                "\"A crime,\" said he, \"the most odious and cowardly of crimes, a judicial\n      crime, has been committed. Military judges, coerced or misled by their\n      superior officers, have condemned an innocent man to an infamous and cruel\n      punishment. Let us not say that the victim is not one of our own party,\n      that he belongs to a caste which was, and always will be, our enemy. Our\n      party is the party of social justice; it can look upon no iniquity with\n      indifference.",
                "\"It would be a shame for us if we left it to Kerdanic, a radical, to\n      Colomban, a member of the middle classes, and to a few moderate\n      Republicans, alone to proceed against the crimes of the army. If the\n      victim is not one of us, his executioners are our brothers' executioners,\n      and before Greatauk struck down this soldier he shot our comrades who were\n      on strike.",
                "\"Comrades, by an intellectual, moral and material effort you must rescue\n      Pyrot from his torment, and in performing this generous act you are not\n      turning aside from the liberating and revolutionary task you have\n      undertaken, for Pyrot his become the symbol of the oppressed and of all\n      the social iniquities that now exist; by destroying one you make all the\n      others tremble.\"",
                "When Phoenix ended, comrade Sapor spoke in these terms:",
                "\"You are advised to abandon your task in order to do something with which\n      you have no concern. Why throw yourselves into a conflict where, on\n      whatever side you turn, you will find none but your natural,\n      uncompromising, even necessary opponents? Are the financiers to be less\n      hated by us than the army? What inept and criminal generosity is it that\n      hurries you to save those seven hundred Pyrotists whom you will always\n      find confronting you in the social war?",
                "\"It is proposed that you act the part of the police for your enemies, and\n      that you are to re-establish for them the order which their own crimes\n      have disturbed. Magnanimity pushed to this degree changes its name.",
                "\"Comrades, there is a point at which infamy becomes fatal to a society.\n      Penguin society is being strangled by its infamy, and you are requested to\n      save it, to give it air that it can breathe. This is simply turning you\n      into ridicule.",
                "\"Leave is to smother itself and let us gaze at its last convulsions with\n      joyful contempt, only regretting that it has so entirely corrupted the\n      soil on which it has been built that we shall find nothing but poisoned\n      mud on which to lay the foundations of a new society.\"",
                "When Sapor had ended his speech comrade Lapersonne pronounced these few\n      words:",
                "\"Phoenix calls us to Pyrot's help for the reason that Pyrot is innocent.\n      It seems to me that that is a very bad reason. If Pyrot is innocent he has\n      behaved like a good soldier and has always conscientiously worked at his\n      trade, which principally consists in shooting the people. That is not a\n      motive to make the people brave all dangers in his defence. When it is\n      demonstrated to me that Pyrot is guilty and that he stole the army hay, I\n      shall be on his side.\"",
                "Comrade Larrivee afterwards spoke.",
                "\"I am not of my friend, Phoenix's opinion but I am not with my friend\n      Sapor either. I do not believe that the party is bound to embrace a cause\n      as soon as we are told that that cause is just. That, I am afraid, is a\n      grievous abuse of words and a dangerous equivocation. For social justice\n      is not revolutionary justice. They are both in perpetual antagonism: to\n      serve the one is to oppose the other. As for me, my choice is made. I am\n      for revolutionary justice as against social justice. Still, in the present\n      case I am against abstention. I say that when a lucky chance brings us an\n      affair like this we should be fools not to profit by it.",
                "\"How? We are given an opportunity of striking terrible, perhaps fatal,\n      blows against militarism. And am I to fold my arms? I tell you, comrades,\n      I am not a fakir, I have never been a fakir, and if there are fakirs here\n      let them not count on me. To sit in meditation is a policy without results\n      and one which I shall never adopt.",
                "\"A party like ours ought to be continually asserting itself. It ought to\n      prove its existence by continual action. We will intervene in the Pyrot\n      affair but we will intervene in it in a revolutionary manner; we will\n      adopt violent action. . . . Perhaps you think that violence is\n      old-fashioned and superannuated, to be scrapped along with diligences,\n      hand-presses and aerial telegraphy. You are mistaken. To-day as yesterday\n      nothing is obtained except by violence; it is the one efficient\n      instrument. The only thing necessary is to know how to use it. You ask\n      what will our action be? I will tell you: it will be to stir up the\n      governing classes against one another, to put the army in conflict with\n      the capitalists, the government with the magistracy, the nobility and\n      clergy with the Jews, and if possible to drive them all to destroy one\n      another. To do this would be to carry on an agitation which would weaken\n      government in the same way that fever wears out the sick.",
                "\"The Pyrot affair, little as we know how to turn it to advantage, will put\n      forward by ten years the growth of the Social party and the emancipation\n      of the proletariat, by disarmament, the general strike, and revolution.\"",
                "The leaders of the party having each expressed a different opinion, the\n      discussion was continued, not without vivacity. The orators, as always\n      happens in such a case, reproduced the arguments they had already brought\n      forward, though with less order and moderation than before. The dispute\n      was prolonged and none changed his opinion. These opinions, in the final\n      analysis, were reduced to two: that of Sapor and Lapersonne who advised\n      abstention, and that of Phoenix and Larrivee, who wanted intervention.\n      Even these two contrary opinions were united in a common hatred of the\n      heads of the army and of their justice, and in a common belief in Pyrot's\n      innocence. So that public opinion was hardly mistaken in regarding all the\n      Socialist leaders as pernicious Anti-Pyrotists.",
                "As for the vast masses in whose name they spoke and whom they represented\n      as far as speech can express the impossible -- as for the proletarians\n      whose thought is difficult to know and who do not know it themselves, it\n      seemed that the Pyrot affair did not interest them. It was too literary\n      for them, it was in too classical a style, and had an upper-middle-class\n      and high-finance tone about it that did not please them much."

                "VIII. THE COLOMBAN TRIAL",
                "When the Colomban trial began, the Pyrotists were not many more than\n      thirty thousand, but they were every where and might be found even among\n      the priests and millionaires. What injured them most was the sympathy of\n      the rich Jews. On the other hand they derived valuable advantages from\n      their feeble number. In the first place there were among them fewer fools\n      than among their opponents, who were over-burdened with them. Comprising\n      but a feeble minority, they co-operated easily, acted with harmony, and\n      had no temptation to divide and thus counteract one another's efforts.\n      Each of them felt the necessity of doing the best possible and was the\n      more careful of his conduct as he found himself more in the public eye.\n      Finally, they had every reason to hope that they would gain fresh\n      adherents, while their opponents, having had everybody with them at the\n      beginning, could only decrease.",
                "Summoned before the judges at a public sitting, Colomban immediately\n      perceived that his judges were not anxious to discover the truth. As soon\n      as he opened his mouth the President ordered him to be silent in the\n      superior interests of the State. For the same reason, which is the supreme\n      reason, the witnesses for the defence were not heard. General Panther, the\n      Chief of the Staff, appeared in the witness-box, in full uniform and\n      decorated with all his orders. He deposed as follows:",
                "\"The infamous Colomban states that we have no proofs against Pyrot. He\n      lies; we have them. I have in my archives seven hundred and thirty-two\n      square yards of them which at five hundred pounds each make three hundred\n      and sixty-six thousand pounds.\"",
                "That superior officer afterwards gave, with elegance and ease, a summary\n      of those proofs.",
                "\"They are of all colours and all shades,\" said he in substance, \"they are\n      of every form -- pot, crown, sovereign, grape, dove-cot, grand eagle,\n      etc. The smallest is less than the hundredth part of a square inch, the\n      largest measures seventy yards long by ninety yards broad.\"",
                "At this revelation the audience shuddered with horror.",
                "Greatauk came to give evidence in his turn. Simpler, and perhaps greater,\n      he wore a grey tunic and held his hands joined behind his back.",
                "\"I leave,\" said he calmly and in a slightly raised voice, \"I leave to M.\n      Colomban the responsibility for an act that has brought our country to the\n      brink of ruin. The Pyrot affair is secret; it ought to remain secret. If\n      it were divulged the cruelest ills, wars, pillages, depredations, fires,\n      massacres, and epidemics would immediately burst upon Penguinia. I should\n      consider myself guilty of high treason if I uttered another word.\"",
                "Some persons known for their political experience, among others M.\n      Bigourd, considered the evidence of the Minister of War as abler and of\n      greater weight than that of his Chief of Staff.",
                "The evidence of Colonel de Boisjoli made a great impression.",
                "\"One evening at the Ministry of War,\" said that officer, \"the attache of a\n      neighbouring Power told me that while visiting his sovereign's stables he\n      had once admired some soft and fragrant hay, of a pretty green colour, the\n      finest hay he had ever seen! 'Where did it come from?' I asked him. He did\n      not answer, but there seemed to me no doubt about its origin. It was the\n      hay Pyrot had stolen. Those qualities of verdure, softness, and aroma, are\n      those of our national hay. The forage of the neighbouring Power is grey\n      and brittle; it sounds under the fork and smells of dust. One can draw one\n      own conclusions.\"",
                "Lieutenant-Colonel Hastaing said in the witness-box, amid hisses, that he\n      did not believe Pyrot guilty. He was immediately seized by the police and\n      thrown into the bottom of a dungeon where, amid vipers, toads, and broken\n      glass, he remained insensible both to promises and threats.",
                "The usher called:",
                "\"Count Pierre Maubec de la Dentdulynx.\"",
                "There was deep silence, and a stately but ill-dressed nobleman, whose\n      moustaches pointed to the skies and whose dark eyes shot forth flashing\n      glances, was seen advancing toward the witness-box.",
                "He approached Colomban and casting upon him a look of ineffable disdain:",
                "\"My evidence,\" said he, \"here it is: you excrement!\"",
                "At these words the entire hall burst into enthusiastic applause and jumped\n      up, moved by one of those transports that stir men's hearts and rouse them\n      to extraordinary actions. Without another word Count Maubec de la\n      Dentdulynx withdrew.",
                "All those present left the Court and formed a procession behind him.\n      Prostrate at his feet, Princess des Boscenos held his legs in a close\n      embrace, but he went on, stern and impassive, beneath a shower of\n      handkerchiefs and flowers. Viscountess Olive, clinging to his neck, could\n      not be removed, and the calm hero bore her along with him, floating on his\n      breast like a light scarf.",
                "When the court resumed its sitting, which it had been compelled to\n      suspend, the President called the experts.",
                "Vermillard, the famous expert in handwriting, gave the results of his\n      researches.",
                "\"Having carefully studied,\" said he, \"the papers found in Pyrot's house,\n      in particular his account book and his laundry books, I noticed that,\n      though apparently not out of the common, they formed an impenetrable\n      cryptogram, the key to which, however, I discovered. The traitor's infamy\n      is to be seen in every line. In this system of writing the words 'Three\n      glasses of beer and twenty francs for Adele' mean 'I have delivered thirty\n      thousand trusses of hay to a neighbouring Power! From these documents I\n      have even been able to establish the composition of the hay delivered by\n      this officer. The words waistcoat, drawers, pocket handkerchief, collars,\n      drink, tobacco, cigars, mean clover, meadowgrass, lucern, burnet, oats,\n      rye-grass, vernal-grass, and common cat's tail grass. And these are\n      precisely the constituents of the hay furnished by Count Maubec to the\n      Penguin cavalry. In this way Pyrot mentioned his crimes in a language that\n      he believed would always remain indecipherable. One is confounded by so\n      much astuteness and so great a want of conscience.\"",
                "Colomban, pronounced guilty without any extenuating circumstances, was\n      condemned to the severest penalty. The judges immediately signed a warrant\n      consuming him to solitary confinement.",
                "In the Place du Palais on the sides of a river whose banks had during the\n      course of twelve centuries seen so great a history, fifty thousand persons\n      were tumultuously awaiting the result of the trial. Here were the heads of\n      the Anti-Pyrotist Association, among whom might be seen Prince des\n      Boscenos, Count Clena, Viscount Olive, and M. de La Trumelle; here crowded\n      the Reverend Father Agaric and the teachers of St. Mael College with their\n      pupils; here the monk Douillard and General Caraguel, embracing each\n      other, formed a sublime group. The market women and laundry women with\n      spits, shovels, tongs, beetles, and kettles full of water might be seen\n      running across the Pont-Vieux. On the steps in front of the bronze gates\n      were assembled all the defenders of Pyrot in Alca, professors, publicists,\n      workmen, some conservatives, others Radicals or Revolutionaries, and by\n      their negligent dress and fierce aspect could be recognised comrades\n      Phoenix, Larrivee, Lapersonne, Dagobert, and Varambille. Squeezed in his\n      funereal frock-coat and wearing his hat of ceremony, Bidault-Coquille\n      invoked the sentimental mathematics on behalf of Colomban and Colonel\n      Hastaing. Maniflore shone smiling and resplendent on the topmost step,\n      anxious, like Leaena, to deserve a glorious monument, or to be given, like\n      Epicharis, the praises of history.",
                "The seven hundred Pyrotists disguised as lemonade sellers,\n      utter-merchants, collectors of odds and ends, or anti-Pyrotists, wandered\n      round the vast building.",
                "When Colomban appeared, so great an uproar burst forth that, struck by the\n      commotion of air and water, birds fell from the trees and fishes floated\n      on the surface of the stream.",
                "On all sides there were yells:",
                "\"Duck Colomban, duck him, duck him!\"",
                "There were some cries of \"Justice and truth!\" and a voice was even heard\n      shouting:",
                "\"Down with the Army!\"",
                "This was the signal for a terrible struggle. The combatants fell in\n      thousands, and their bodies formed howling and moving mounds on top of\n      which fresh champions gripped each other by the throats. Women, eager,\n      pale, and dishevelled, with clenched teeth and frantic nails, rushed on\n      the man, in transports that, in the brilliant light of the public square,\n      gave to their faces expressions unsurpassed even in the shade of curtains\n      and in the hollows of pillows. They were going to seize Colomban, to bite\n      him, to strangle, dismember and rend him, when Maniflore, tall and\n      dignified in her red tunic, stood forth, serene and terrible, confronting\n      these furies who recoiled from before her in terror. Colomban seemed to be\n      saved; his partisans succeeded in clearing a passage for him through the\n      Place du Palais and in putting him into a cab stationed at the corner of\n      the Pont-Vieux. The horse was already in full trot when Prince des\n      Boscenos, Count Clena, and M. de La Trumelle knocked the driver off his\n      seat. Then, making the animal back and pushing the spokes of the wheels,\n      they ran the vehicle on to the parapet of the bridge, whence they\n      overturned it into the river amid the cheers of the delirious crowd. With\n      a resounding splash a jet of water rose upwards, and then nothing but a\n      slight eddy was to be seen on the surface of the stream.",
                "Almost immediately comrades Dagobert and Varambille, with the help of the\n      seven hundred disguised Pyrotists, sent Prince des Boscenos head foremost\n      into a river-laundry in which he was lamentably swallowed up.",
                "Serene night descended over the Place du Palais and shed silence and peace\n      upon the frightful ruins with which it was strewed. In the mean time,\n      Colomban, three thousand yards down the stream, cowering beside a lame old\n      horse on a bridge, was meditating on the ignorance and injustice of\n      crowds.",
                "\"The business,\" said he to himself, \"is even more troublesome than I\n      believed. I foresee fresh difficulties.\"",
                "He got up and approached the unhappy animal.",
                "\"What have you, poor friend, done to them?\" said he. \"It is on my account\n      they have used you so cruelly.\"",
                "He embraced the unfortunate beast and kissed the white star on his\n      forehead. Then he took him by the bridle and led him, both of them\n      limping, trough the sleeping city to his house, where sleep soon allowed\n      them to forget mankind."

                "The ceremony took place on the fifteenth of June. General Caraguel,\n      surrounded by his staff, occupied the churchwarden's pew. The congregation\n      was numerous and brilliant. According to M. Bigourd's expression it was\n      both crowded and select. In the front rank was to be seen M. de la\n      Bertheoseille, Chamberlain to his Highness Prince Crucho. Near the pulpit,\n      which was to be ascended by the Reverend Father Douillard, of the Order of\n      St. Francis, were gathered, in an attitude of attention with their hands\n      crossed upon their wands of office, the great dignitaries of the\n      Anti-Pyrotist association, Viscount Olive, M. de La Trumelle, Count Clena,\n      the Duke d'Ampoule, and Prince des Boscenos. Father Agaric was in the apse\n      with the teachers and pupils of St. Mael College. The right-hand transept\n      and aisle were reserved for officers and soldiers in uniform, this side\n      being thought the more honourable, since the Lord leaned his head to the\n      right when he died on the Cross. The ladies of the aristocracy, and among\n      them Countess Clena, Viscountess Olive, and Princess des Boscenos,\n      occupied reserved seats. In the immense building and in the square outside\n      were gathered twenty thousand clergy of all sorts, as well as thirty\n      thousand of the laity.",
                "After the expiatory and propitiatory ceremony the Reverend Father\n      Douillard ascended the pulpit. The sermon had at first been entrusted to\n      the Reverend Father Agaric, but, in spite of his merits, he was thought\n      unequal to the occasion in zeal and doctrine, and the eloquent Capuchin\n      friar, who for six months had gone through the barracks preaching against\n      the enemies of God and authority, had been chosen in his place.",
                "The Reverend Father Douillard, taking as his text, \"He hath put down the\n      mighty from their seat,\" established that all temporal power has God as\n      its principle and its end, and that it is ruined and destroyed when it\n      turns aside from the path that Providence has traced out for it and from\n      the end to which He has directed it.",
                "Applying these sacred rules to the government of Penguinia, he drew a\n      terrible picture of the evils that the country's rulers had been unable\n      either to prevent or to foresee.",
                "\"The first author of all these miseries and degradations, my brethren,\"\n       said he, \"is only too well known to you. He is a monster whose destiny is\n      providentially proclaimed by his name, for it is derived from the Greek\n      word, pyros, which means fire. Eternal wisdom warns us by this etymology\n      that a Jew was to set ablaze the country that had welcomed him.\"",

                "At these words a prolonged shudder passed through the assembly.",
                "The powerful orator excited still greater indignation when he described\n      the proud and crime-stained Colomban, plunged into the stream, all the\n      waters of which could not cleanse him. He gathered up all the humiliations\n      and all the perils of the Penguins in order to reproach the President of\n      the Republic and his Prime Minister with them.",
                "\"That Minister,\" said he, \"having been guilty of degrading cowardice in\n      not exterminating the seven hundred Pyrotists with their allies and\n      defenders, as Saul exterminated the Philistines at Gibeah, has rendered\n      himself unworthy of exercising the power that God delegated to him, and\n      every good citizen ought henceforth to insult his contemptible government.\n      Heaven will look favourably on those who despise him. 'He hath put down\n      the mighty from their seat.' God will depose these pusillanimous chiefs\n      and will put in their place strong men who will call upon Him. I tell you,\n      gentlemen, I tell you officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers\n      who listen to me, I tell you General of the Penguin armies, the hour has\n      come! If you do not obey God's orders, if in His name you do not depose\n      those now in authority, if you do not establish a religious and strong\n      government in Penguinia, God will none the less destroy what He has\n      condemned, He will none the less save His people. He will save them, but,\n      if you are wanting, He will do so by means of a humble artisan or a simple\n      corporal. Hasten! The hour will soon be past.\"",
                "Excited by this ardent exhortation, the sixty thousand people present rose\n      up trembling and shouting: \"To arms! To arms! Death to the Pyrotists!\n      Hurrah for Crucho!\" and all of them, monks, women, soldiers, noblemen,\n      citizens, and loafers, who were gathered beneath the superhuman arm\n      uplifted in the pulpit, struck up the hymn, \"Let us save Penguinia!\" They\n      rushed impetuously from the basilica and marched along the quays to the\n      Chamber of Deputies.",

MM. de La Trumelle\n      and d'Ampoule were taken to the police station. Prince des Boscenos, after\n      a valiant struggle, fell upon the bloody pavement with a fractured skull.",
                "In the enthusiasm of victory, the comrades, mingled with an innumerable\n      crowd of paper-sellers and gutter-merchants, ran through the boulevards\n      all night, carrying, Maniflore in triumph, and breaking the mirrors of the\n      cafes and the glasses of the street lamps amid cries of \"Down with Crucho!\n      Hurrah for the Social Revolution!\" The Anti-Pyrotists in their turn upset\n      the newspaper kiosks and tore down the hoardings.",
                "These were spectacles of which cool reason cannot approve and they were\n      fit causes for grief to the municipal authorities, who desired to preserve\n      the good order of the roads and streets. But, what was sadder for a man of\n      heart was the sight or the canting humbugs, who, from fear of blows, kept\n      at an equal distance from the two camps, and who, although they allowed\n      their selfishness and cowardice to be visible, claimed admiration for the\n      generosity of their sentiments and the nobility of their souls. They\n      rubbed their eyes with onions, gaped like whitings, blew violently into\n      their handkerchiefs, and, bringing their voices out of the depths of their\n      stomachs, groaned forth: \"O Penguins, cease these fratricidal struggles;\n      cease to rend your mother's bosom!\" As if men could live in society\n      without disputes and without quarrels, and as if civil discords were not\n      the necessary conditions of national life and progress. They showed\n      themselves hypocritical cowards by proposing a compromise between the just\n      and the unjust, offending the just in his rectitude and the unjust in his\n      courage. One of these creatures, the rich and powerful Machimel, a\n      champion coward, rose upon the town like a colossus of grief; his tears\n      formed poisonous lakes at his feet and his sighs capsized the boats of the\n      fishermen.",

A caricature of him in\n      company with those of Colomban, Kerdanic, and Colonel Hastaing was to be\n      seen in the newspaper kiosks. The Anti-Pyrotists proclaimed that he had\n      received fifty thousand francs from the big Jewish financiers. The\n      reporters of the militarist sheets held interviews regarding his\n      scientific knowledge with official scholars, who declared he had no\n      knowledge of the stars, disputed his most solid observations, denied his\n      most certain discoveries, and condemned his most ingenious and most\n      fruitful hypotheses. He exulted under these flattering blows of hatred and\n      envy.",
                "He contemplated the black immensity pierced by a multitude of lights,\n      without giving a thought to all the heavy slumbers, cruel insomnias, vain\n      dreams, spoilt pleasures, and infinitely diverse miseries that a great\n      city contains.",
                "\"It is in this enormous city,\" said he to himself, \"that the just and the\n      unjust are joining battle.\"",

                "Hitherto blinded by fear, incautious and stupid before the bands of Friar\n      Douillard and the partisans of Prince Crucho, the Republicans at last\n      opened their eyes and grasped the real meaning of the Pyrot affair. The\n      deputies who had for two years turned pale at the shouts of the patriotic\n      crowds became, not indeed more courageous, but altered their cowardice and\n      blamed Robin Mielleux for disorders which their own compliance had\n      encouraged, and the instigators of which they had several times slavishly\n      congratulated. They reproached him for having imperilled the Republic by a\n      weakness which was really theirs and a timidity which they themselves had\n      imposed upon him. Some of them began to doubt whether it was not to their\n      interest to believe in Pyrot's innocence rather than in his guilt, and\n      thenceforward they felt a bitter anguish at the thought that the unhappy\n      man might have been wrongly convicted and that in his aerial cage he might\n      be expiating another man's crimes. \"I cannot sleep on account of it!\" was\n      what several members of Minister Guillaumette's majority used to say. But\n      these were ambitious to replace their chief.",
                "These generous legislators overthrew the cabinet, and the President of the\n      Republic put in Robin Mielleux's place, a patriarchal Republican with a\n      flowing beard, La Trinite by name, who, like most of the Penguins,\n      understood nothing about the affair, but thought that too many monks were\n      mixed up in it.",
                "General Greatauk before leaving the Ministry of War, gave his final advice\n      to Pariler, the Chief of the Staff.",
                "\"I go and you remain,\" said he, as he shook hands with him. \"The Pyrot\n      affair is my daughter; I confide her to you, she is worthy of your love\n      and your care; she is beautiful. Do not forget that her beauty loves the\n      shade, is leased with mystery, and likes to remain veiled. Great her\n      modesty with gentleness. Too many indiscreet looks have already profaned\n      her charms. . . . Panther, you desired proofs and you obtained them. You\n      have many, perhaps too many, in your possession. I see that there will be\n      many tiresome interventions and much dangerous curiosity. If I were in\n      your place I would tear up all those documents. Believe me, the best of\n      proofs is none at all. That is the only one which nobody discusses.\"",
                "Alas! General Panther did not realise the wisdom of this advice. The\n      future was only too thoroughly to justify Greatauk's perspicacity. La\n      Trinite demanded the documents belonging, to the Pyrot affair. Peniche,\n      his Minister of War, refused them in the superior interests of the\n      national defence, telling him that the documents under General Panther's\n      care formed the hugest mass of archives in the world. La Trinite studied\n      the case as well as he could, and, without penetrating to the bottom of\n      the matter, suspected it of irregularity. Conformably to his rights and\n      prerogatives he then ordered a fresh trial to be held. Immediately,\n      Peniche, his Minister of War, accused him of insulting the army and\n      betraying the country and flung his portfolio at his head. He was replaced\n      by a second, who did the same. To him succeeded a third, who imitated\n      these examples, and those after him to the number of seventy acted like\n      their predecessors, until the venerable La Trinite groaned beneath the\n      weight of bellicose portfolios. The seventy-first Minister of War, van\n      Julep, retained office. Not that he was in disagreement with so many and\n      such noble colleagues, but he had been commissioned by them generously to\n      betray his Prime Minister, to cover him with shame and opprobrium, and to\n      convert the new trial to the glory of Greatauk, the satisfaction of the\n      Anti-Pyrotists, the profit of the monks, and the restoration of Prince\n      Crucho.",
                "General van Julep, though endowed with high military virtues, was not\n      intelligent enough to employ the subtle conduct and exquisite methods of\n      Greatauk. He thought, like General Panther, that tangible proofs against\n      Pyrot were necessary, that they could never ave too many of them, that\n      they could never have even enough. He expressed these' sentiments to his\n      Chief of Staff, who was only too inclined to agree with them.",
                "\"Panther,\" said he, \"we are at the moment when we need abundant and\n      superabundant proofs.\"",
                "\"You have said enough, General,\" answered Panther, \"I will complete my\n      piles of documents.\"",
                "Six months later the proofs against Pyrot filled two storeys of the\n      Ministry of War. The ceiling fell in beneath the weight of the bundles,\n      and the avalanche of falling documents crushed two head clerks, fourteen\n      second clerks, and sixty copying clerks, who were at work upon the ground\n      floor arranging a change in the fashion of the cavalry gaiters. The walls\n      of the huge edifice had to be propped. Passers-by saw with amazement\n      enormous beams and monstrous stanchions which reared themselves obliquely\n      against the noble front of the building, now tottering and disjointed, and\n      blocked up the streets, stopped the carriages, and presented to the\n      motor-omnibuses an obstacle against which they dashed with their loads of\n      passengers.",
                "The judges who had condemned Pyrot were not, properly speaking, judges but\n      soldiers. The judges who had condemned Colomban were real judges, but of\n      inferior rank, wearing seedy black clothes like church vergers, unlucky\n      wretches of judges, miserable judgelings. Above them were the superior\n      judges who wore ermine robes over their black gowns. These, renowned for\n      their knowledge and doctrine, formed a court whose terrible name expressed\n      power. It was called the Court of Appeal (Cassation) so as to make it\n      clear that it was the hammer suspended over the judgments and decrees of\n      all other jurisdictions.",
                "One of these superior red Judges of the Supreme Court, called Chaussepied,\n      led a modest and tranquil life in a suburb of Alca. His soul was pure, his\n      heart honest, his spirit just. When he had finished studying his documents\n      he used to play the violin and cultivate hyacinths. Every Sunday he dined\n      with his neighbours the Mesdemoiselles Helbivore. His old age was cheerful\n      and robust and his friends often praised the amenity of his character.",
                "For some months, however, he had been irritable and touchy, and when he\n      opened a newspaper his broad and ruddy face would become covered with\n      dolorous wrinkles and darkened with an angry purple. Pyrot was the cause\n      of it. Justice Chaussepied could not understand how an officer could have\n      committed so black a crime as to hand over eighty thousand trusses of\n      military hay to a neighbouring and hostile Power. And he could still less\n      conceive how a scoundrel should have found official defenders in\n      Penguinia. The thought that there existed in his country a Pyrot, a\n      Colonel Hastaing, a Colomban, a Kerdanic, a Phoenix, spoilt his hyacinths,\n      his violin, his heaven, and his earth, all nature, and even his dinner\n      with the Mesdemoiselles Helbivore!",
                "In the mean time the Pyrot case, having been presented to the Supreme\n      Court by the Keeper of Seals, it fell to Chaussepied to examine it and\n      cover its defects, in case any existed. Although as upright and honest as\n      a man can be, and trained by long habit to exercise his magistracy without\n      fear or favour, he expected to find in the documents he submitted to him\n      proofs of certain guilt and obvious criminality. After lengthened\n      difficulties and repeated refusals on the part of General Julep, Justice\n      Chaussepied was allowed to examine the documents. Numbered and initialed\n      they ran to the number of fourteen millions six hundred and twenty-six\n      thousand three hundred and twelve. As he studied them the judge was at\n      first surprised, then astonished, then stupefied, amazed, and, if I dare\n      say so, flabbergasted. He found among the documents prospectuses of new\n      fancy shops, newspapers, fashion-plates, paper bags, old business letters,\n      exercise books, brown paper, green paper for rubbing parquet floors,\n      playing cards, diagrams, six thousand copies of the \"Key to Dreams,\" but\n      not a single document in which any mention was made of Pyrot."

Greatauk, in this second affair, surpassed himself. He\n      obtained a second conviction; he obtained it by declaring that the proofs\n      communicated to the Supreme Court were worth nothing, and that great care\n      had been taken to keep back the good ones, since they ought to remain\n      secret. In the opinion of connoisseurs he had never shown so much address.\n      On leaving the court, as he passed through the vestibule with a tranquil\n      step, and his hands behind his back, amidst a crowd of sight-seers, a\n      woman dressed in red and with her face covered by a black veil rushed at\n      him, brandishing a kitchen knife.",
                "\"Die, scoundrel!\" she cried. It was Maniflore. Before those present could\n      understand what was happening, the general seized her by the wrist, and\n      with apparent gentleness, squeezed it so forcibly that the knife fell from\n      her aching hand.",
                "Then he picked it up and handed it to Maniflore.",
                "\"Madam,\" said he with a bow, \"you have dropped a household utensil.\"",
                "He could not prevent the heroine from being taken to the police-station;\n      but he had her immediately released and afterwards he employed all his\n      influence to stop the prosecution.",
                "The second conviction of Pyrot was Greatauk's last victory.",
                "Justice Chaussepied, who had formerly liked soldiers so much, and esteemed\n      their justice so highly, being now enraged with the military judges,\n      quashed their judgments as a monkey cracks nuts. He rehabilitated Pyrot a\n      second time; he would, if necessary, have rehabilitated him five hundred\n      times.",
                "Furious at having been cowards and at having allowed themselves to be\n      deceived and made game of, the Republicans turned against the monks and\n      clergy. The deputies passed laws of expulsion, separation, and spoliation\n      against them. What Father Cornemuse had foreseen took place. That good\n      monk was driven from the Wood of Conils. Treasury officers confiscated his\n      retorts and his stills, and the liquidators divided amongst them his\n      bottles of St. Oberosian liqueur. The pious distiller lost the annual\n      income of three million five hundred thousand francs that his products\n      procured for him. Father Agaric went into exile, abandoning his school\n      into the hands of laymen, who soon allowed it to fall into decay.\n      Separated from its foster-mother, the State, the Church of Penguinia\n      withered like a plucked flower.",
                "The victorious defenders of the innocent man now abused each other and\n      overwhelmed each other reciprocally with insults and calumnies. The\n      vehement Kerdanic hurled himself upon Phoenix as if ready to devour him.\n      The wealthy Jews and the seven hundred Pyrotists turned away with disdain\n      from the socialist comrades whose aid they had humbly implored in the\n      past.",

Gentlemen, those who, as I am, are anxious for reform,\n      ought to apply themselves before everything else to cure this agitation\n      which enfeebles government just as fever exhausts those who are ill. It is\n      time to reassure honest people.\"",
                "This speech was received with applause.

Consumed with a desire for fresh devotions and\n      fresh sacrifices, she had gone in company with a young Bulgarian to bear\n      justice and vengeance to Sofia. He did not regret her, having perceived\n      after the Affair, that she was less beautiful in form and in thought than\n      he had at first imagined. His impressions had been modified in the same\n      direction concerning many other forms and many other thoughts.

But\n      three-fourths of those who defended Greatauk against the attacks of the\n      seven hundred Pyrotists knew that better than you. Of what then did you\n      show yourself so proud? Of having dared to say what you thought? That is\n      civic courage, and, like military courage, it is a mere result of\n      imprudence. You have been imprudent. So far so good, but that is no reason\n      for praising yourself beyond measure. Your imprudence was trifling; it\n      exposed you to trifling perils; you did not risk your head by it. The\n      Penguins have lost that cruel and sanguinary pride which formerly gave a\n      tragic grandeur to their revolutions; it is the fatal result of the\n      weakening of beliefs and character. Ought one to look upon oneself as a\n      superior spirit for having shown a little more clear-sightedness than the\n      vulgar? I am very much afraid, on the contrary, Bidault-Coquille, that you\n      have given proof of a gross misunderstanding of the conditions of the\n      moral and intellectual development of a people. You imagined that social\n      injustices were threaded together like pearls and that it would be enough\n      to pull off one in order to unfasten the whole necklace. That is a very\n      ingenuous conception. You flattered yourself that at one stroke you were\n      establishing justice in your own country and in the universe. You were a\n      brave man, an honest idealist, though without much experimental\n      philosophy. But go home to your own heart and you will recognise that you\n      had in you a spice of malice and that our ingenuousness was not without\n      cunning. You believed you were performing a fine moral action. You said to\n      yourself: 'Here am I, just and courageous once for all. I can henceforth\n      repose in the public esteem and the praise of historians.' And now that\n      you have lost your illusions, now that you know how hard it is to redress\n      wrongs, and that the task must ever be begun afresh, you are going back to\n      your asteroids. You are right; but go back to them with modesty,\n      Bidault-Coquille!\""

                "I. MADAME CLARENCE'S DRAWING-ROOM",
                "Madame Clarence, the widow of an exalted functionary of the Republic,\n      loved to entertain. Every Thursday she collected together some friends of\n      modest condition who took pleasure in conversation. The ladies who went to\n      see her, very different in age and rank, were all without money, and had\n      all suffered much. There was a duchess who looked like a fortune-teller\n      and a fortune-teller who looked like a duchess. Madame Clarence was pretty\n      enough to maintain some old liaisons, but not to form new ones, and she\n      generally inspired a quiet esteem. She had a very pretty daughter, who,\n      since she had no dower, caused some alarm among the male guests; for the\n      Penguins were as much afraid of portionless girls as they were of the\n      devil himself. Eveline Clarence, noticing their reserve and perceiving its\n      cause, used to hand them their tea with an air of disdain. Moreover, she\n      seldom appeared at the parties and talked only to the ladies or the very\n      young people. Her discreet and retiring presence put no restraint upon the\n      conversation, since those who took part in it thought either that as she\n      was a young girl she would not understand it, or that, being twenty-five\n      years old, she might listen to everything.",
                "One Thursday therefore, in Madame Clarence's drawing-room, the\n      conversation turned upon love. The ladies spoke of it with pride,\n      delicacy, and mystery, the men with discretion and fatuity; everyone took\n      an interest in the conversation, for each one was interested in what he or\n      she said. A great deal of wit flowed; brilliant apostrophes were launched\n      forth and keen repartees were returned. But when Professor Haddi began to\n      speak he overwhelmed everybody.",
                "\"It is the same with our ideas on love as with our ideas on everything\n      else,\" said he, \"they rest upon anterior habits whose very memory has been\n      effaced. In morals, the limitations that have lost their grounds for\n      existing, the most useless obligations, the cruelest and most injurious\n      restraints, are because of their profound antiquity and the mystery of\n      their origin, the least disputed and the least disputable as well as the\n      most respected, and they are those that cannot be violated without\n      incurring the most severe blame. All morality relative to the relations of\n      the sexes is founded on this principle: that a woman once obtained belongs\n      to the man, that she is his property like his horse or his weapons. And\n      this having ceased to be true, absurdities result from it, such as the\n      marriage or contract of sale of a woman to a man, with clauses restricting\n      the right of ownership introduced as a consequence of the gradual\n      diminution of the claims of the possessor.",
                "\"The obligation imposed on a girl that she should bring her virginity to\n      her husband comes from the times when girls were married immediately they\n      were of a marriageable age. It is ridiculous that a girl who marries at\n      twenty-five or thirty should be subject to that obligation. You will,\n      perhaps, say that it is a present with which her husband, if she gets one\n      at last, will be gratified; but every moment we see men wooing married\n      women and showing themselves perfectly satisfied to take them as they find\n      them.",
                "\"Still, even in our own day, the duty of girls is determined in religious\n      morality by the old belief that God, the most powerful of warriors, is\n      polygamous, that he has reserved all maidens for himself, and that men can\n      only take those whom he has left. This belief, although traces of it exist\n      in several metaphors of mysticism, is abandoned to-day, by most civilised\n      peoples. However, it still dominates the education of girls not only among\n      our believers, but even among our free-thinkers, who, as a rule, think\n      freely for the reason that they do not think at all.",
                "\"Discretion means ability to separate and discern. We say that a girl is\n      discreet when she knows nothing at all. We cultivate her ignorance. In\n      spite of all our care the most discreet know something, for we cannot\n      conceal from them their own nature and their own sensations. But they know\n      badly, they know in a wrong way. That is all we obtain by our careful\n      education. . . .\"",
                "\"Sir,\" suddenly said Joseph Boutourle, the High Treasurer of Alca,\n      \"believe me, there are innocent girls, perfectly innocent girls, and it is\n      a great pity. I have known three. They married, and the result was\n      tragical.\"",
                "\"I have noticed,\" Professor Haddock went on, \"that Europeans in general\n      and Penguins in particular occupy themselves, after sport and motoring,\n      with nothing so much as with love. It is giving a great deal of importance\n      to a matter that has very little weight.\"",
                "\"Then, Professor,\" exclaimed Madame Cremeur in a choking voice, \"when a\n      woman has completely surrendered herself to you, you think it is a matter\n      of no importance?\"",
                "\"No, Madame; it can have its importance,\" answered Professor Haddock, \"but\n      it is necessary to examine if when she surrenders herself to us she offers\n      us a delicious fruit-garden or a plot of thistles and dandelions. And\n      then, do we not misuse words? In love, a woman lends herself rather than\n      gives herself. Look at the pretty Madame Pensee. . . .\"",
                "\"She is my mother,\" said a tall, fair young man.",
                "\"Sir, I have the greatest respect for her,\" replied Professor Haddock; \"do\n      not be afraid that I intend to say anything in the least offensive about\n      her. But allow me to tell you that, as a rule, the opinions of sons about\n      their mothers are not to be relied on. They do not bear enough in mind\n      that a mother is a mother only because she loved, and that she can still\n      love. That, however, is the case, and it would be deplorable were it\n      otherwise. I have noticed, on the contrary, that daughters do not deceive\n      themselves about their mothers' faculty for loving or about the use they\n      make of it; they are rivals; they have their eyes upon them.\"",
                "The insupportable Professor spoke a great deal longer, adding indecorum to\n      awkwardness, and impertinence to incivility, accumulating incongruities,\n      despising what is respectable, respecting what is despicable; but no one\n      listened to him further.",
                "During this time in a room that was simple without grace, a room sad for\n      the want of love, a room which, like all young girls' rooms, had something\n      of the cold atmosphere of a place of waiting about it, Eveline Clarence\n      turned over the pages of club annuals and prospectuses of charities in\n      order to obtain from them some acquaintance with society. Being convinced\n      that her mother, shut up in her own intellectual but poor world, could\n      neither bring her out or push her into prominence, she decided that she\n      herself would seek the best means of winning a husband. At once calm and\n      obstinate, without dreams or illusions, and regarding marriage as but a\n      ticket of admission or a passport, she kept before her mind a clear notion\n      of the hazards, difficulties, and chances of her enterprise. She had the\n      art of pleasing and a coldness of temperament that enabled her to turn it\n      to its fullest advantage. Her weakness lay in the fact that she was\n      dazzled by anything that had an aristocratic air.",
                "When she was alone with her mother she said:",

It was also intended to draw down\n      upon so man noble and illustrious families the benediction of L.\n      Orberosia, who loves the Penguins. The Reverend Father Douillard strove\n      for the completion of his task with a truly apostolical zeal.

She preserved them in a jam-pot, and when\n      religion was again restored, brought them to the venerable Cure of St.\n      Maels.

                "It is certain that in the time of Father Douillard, although faith was\n      declining, the cult of St. Orberosia, which for three hundred years had\n      fallen under the criticism of Canon Princeteau and the silence of the\n      Doctors of the Church, recovered, and was surrounded with more pomp, more\n      splendour, and more fervour than ever. The theologians did not now\n      subtract a single iota from the legend. They held as certainly established\n      all the facts related by Abbot Simplicissimus, and in particular declared,\n      on the testimony of that monk, that the devil, assuming a monk's form had\n      carried off the saint to a cave and had there striven with her until she\n      overcame him. Neither places nor dates caused them any embarrassment. They\n      paid no heed to exegesis and took good care not to grant as much to\n      science as Canon Princeteau had formerly conceded. They knew too well\n      whither that would lead.",
                "The church shone with lights and flowers. An operatic tenor sang the\n      famous canticle of St. Orberosia:",
                "Virgin of Paradise\n     Come, come in the dusky night\n     And on us shed\n     Thy beams of light.",
                "Mademoiselle Clarence sat beside her mother and in front of Viscount\n      Clena. She remained kneeling during a considerable time, for the attitude\n      of prayer is natural to discreet virgins and it shows off their figures.",
                "The Reverend Father Douillard ascended the pulpit. He was a powerful\n      orator and could, at once melt, surprise, and rouse his hearers. Women\n      complained only that he fulminated against vice with excessive harshness\n      and in crude terms that made them blush. But they liked him none the less\n      for it.",
                "He treated in his sermon of the seventh trial of St. Orberosia, who was\n      tempted by the dragon which she went forth to combat. But she did not\n      yield, and she disarmed the monster. The orator demonstrated without\n      difficulty that we, also, by the aid of St. Orberosia, and strong in the\n      virtue which she inspires, can in our turn overthrow the dragons that dart\n      upon us and are waiting to devour us, the dragon of doubt, the dragon of\n      impiety, the dragon of forgetfulness of religious duties. He proved that\n      the charity of St. Orberosia was a work of social regeneration, and he\n      concluded by an ardent appeal to the faithful \"to become instruments of\n      the Divine mercy, eager upholders and supporters of the charity of St.\n      Orberosia, and to furnish it with all the means which it required to take\n      its flight and bear its salutary fruits.\" *",

                "After the ceremony, the Reverend Father Douillard remained in the sacristy\n      at the disposal of those of the faithful who desired information\n      concerning the charity, or who wished to bring their contributions.\n      Mademoiselle Clarence wished to speak to Father Douillard, so did Viscount\n      Clena. The crowd was large, and a queue was formed. By chance Viscount\n      Clena and Mademoiselle Clarence were side by side and possibly they were\n      squeezed a little closely to each other by the crowd. Eveline had noticed\n      this fashionable young man, who was almost as well known as his father in\n      the world of sport. Clena had noticed her, and, as he thought her pretty,\n      he bowed to her, then apologised and pretended to believe that he had been\n      introduced to the ladies, but could not remember where. They pretended to\n      believe it also.",
                "He presented himself the following week at Madame Clarence's, thinking\n      that her house was a bit fast -- a thing not likely to displease him -- and\n      when he saw Eveline again he felt he had not been mistaken and that she\n      was an extremely pretty girl.",
                "Viscount Clena had the finest motor-car in Europe. For three months he\n      drove the Clarences every day over hills and plains, through woods and\n      valleys; they visited famous sites and went over celebrated castles. He\n      said to Eveline all that could be said and did all that could be done to\n      overcome her resistance. She did not conceal from him that she loved him,\n      that she would always love him, and love no one but him. She remained\n      grave and trembling by his side. To his devouring passion she opposed the\n      invincible defence of a virtue conscious of its danger. At the end of\n      three months, after having gone uphill and down hill, turned sharp\n      corners, and negotiated level crossings, and experienced innumerable\n      break-downs, he knew her as well as he knew the fly-wheel of his car, but\n      not much better. He employed surprises, adventures, sudden stoppages in\n      the depths of forests and before hotels, but he had advanced no farther.\n      He said to himself that it was absurd; then, taking her again in his car\n      he set off at fifty miles an hour quite prepared to upset her in a ditch\n      or to smash himself and her against a tree.",
                "One day, having come to take her on some excursion, he found her more\n      charming than ever, and more provoking. He darted upon her as a storm\n      falls upon the reeds that border a lake. She bent with adorable weakness\n      beneath the breath of the storm, and twenty times was almost carried away\n      by its strength, but twenty times she arose, supple and, bowing to the\n      wind. After all these shocks one would have said that a light breeze had\n      barely touched her charming stem; she smiled as if ready to be plucked by\n      a bold hand. Then her unhappy aggressor, desperate, enraged, and three\n      parts mad, fled so as not to kill her, mistook the door, went into the\n      bedroom of Madame Clarence, whom he found putting on her hat in front of a\n      wardrobe, seized her, flung her on the bed, and possessed her before she\n      knew what had happened.",
                "The same day Eveline, who had been making inquiries, learned that Viscount\n      Clena had nothing but debts, lived on money given him by an elderly lady,\n      and promoted the sale of the latest models of a motor-car manufacturer.\n      They separated with common accord and Eveline began again disdainfully to\n      serve tea to her mother's guests."

                "\"It seems to me,\" said he, \"that the Penguin ladies have made a great fuss\n      since, through St. Mael's agency, they became viviparous. But there is\n      nothing to be particularly proud of in that, for it is a state they share\n      in common with cows and pigs, and even with orange and lemon trees, for\n      the seeds of these plants germinate in the pericarp.\"",
                "\"The self-importance which the Penguin ladies give themselves does not go\n      so far back as that,\" answered M. Boutourle. \"It dates from the day when\n      the holy apostle gave them clothes. But this self-importance was long kept\n      in restraint, and displayed itself fully only with increased luxury of\n      dress and in a small section of society. For go only two leagues from Alca\n      into the country at harvest time, and you will see whether women are\n      over-precise or self-important.\"",
                "On that day M. Hippolyte Ceres paid his first call. He was a Deputy of\n      Alca, and one of the youngest members of the House. His father was said to\n      have kept a dram shop, but he himself was a lawyer of robust physique, a\n      good though prolix speaker, with a self-important air and a reputation for\n      ability.",
                "\"M. Ceres,\" said the mistress of the house, \"your constituency is one of\n      the finest in Alca.\"",

                "\"Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a stroll through it any longer,\"\n       said M. Boutourle.",

                "\"Do not give them a bad name,\" answered the Deputy. \"They are our great\n      national industry.\"",
                "\"I know. The Penguins of to-day make me think of the ancient Egyptians.\n      According to Clement of Alexandria, Taine tells us -- though he\n      misquotes the text -- the Egyptians worshipped the crocodiles that\n      devoured them. The Penguins to-day worship the motors that crush them.\n      Without a doubt the future belongs to the metal beast. We are no more\n      likely to go back to cabs than we are to go back to the diligence. And the\n      long martyrdom of the horse will come to an end. The motor, which the\n      frenzied cupidity of manufacturers hurls like a juggernaut's car upon the\n      bewildered people and of which the idle and fashionable make a foolish\n      though fatal elegance, will soon begin to perform its true function, and\n      putting its strength at the service of the entire people, will behave like\n      a docile, toiling monster. But in order that the motor may cease to be\n      injurious and become beneficent we must build roads suited to its speed,\n      roads which it cannot tear up with its ferocious tyres, and from which it\n      will send no clouds of poisonous dust into human lungs. We ought not to\n      allow slower vehicles or mere animals to go upon those roads, and we\n      should establish garages upon them and foot-bridges over them, and so\n      create order and harmony among the means of communication of the future.\n      That is the wish of every good citizen.\"",
                "Madame Clarence led the conversation back to the improvements in M. Ceres' \n      constituency. M. Ceres showed his enthusiasm for demolitions, tunnelings,\n      constructions, reconstructions, and all other fruitful operations.",
                "\"We build to-day in an admirable style,\" said he; \"everywhere majestic\n      avenues are being reared. Was ever anything as fine as our arcaded bridges\n      and our domed hotels!\"",
                "\"You are forgetting that big palace surmounted an immense melon-shaped\n      dome,\" grumbled by M. Daniset, an old art amateur, in a voice of\n      restrained rage. \"I am amazed at the degree of ugliness which a modern\n      city can attain. Alca is becoming Americanised. Everywhere we are\n      destroying all that is free, unexpected, measured, restrained, human, or\n      traditional among the things that are left us. Everywhere we are\n      destroying that charming object, a piece of an old wall that bears up the\n      branches of a tree. Everywhere we are suppressing some fragment of light\n      and air, some fragment of nature, some fragment of the associations that\n      still remain with us, some fragment of our fathers, some fragment of\n      ourselves. And we are putting up frightful, enormous, infamous houses,\n      surmounted in Viennese style by ridiculous domes, or fashioned after the\n      models of the 'new art' without mouldings, or having profiles with\n      sinister corbels and burlesque pinnacles, and such monsters as these\n      shamelessly peer over the surrounding buildings. We see bulbous\n      protuberances stuck on the fronts of buildings and we are told they are\n      'new art' motives. I have seen the 'new art' in other countries, but it is\n      not so ugly as with us; it has fancy and it has simplicity. It is only in\n      our own country that by a sad privilege we may behold the newest and most\n      diverse styles of architectural ugliness. Not an enviable privilege!\"",
                "\"Are you not afraid,\" asked M. Ceres severely, \"are you not afraid that\n      these bitter criticisms tend to keep out of our capital the foreigners who\n      flow into it from all arts of the world and who leave millions behind\n      them?\"",
                "\"You may set your mind at rest about that,\" answered M. Daniset.\n      \"Foreigners do not come to admire our buildings; they come to see our\n      courtesans, our dressmakers, and our dancing saloons.\"",
                "\"We have one bad habit,\" sighed M. Ceres, \"it is that we calumniate\n      ourselves.\"",
                "Madame Clarence as an accomplished hostess thought it was time to return\n      to the subject of love and asked M. Jumel his opinion of M. Leon Blum's\n      recent book in which the author complained. . . .",
                "\". . . That an irrational custom,\" went on Professor Haddock, \"prevents\n      respectable young ladies from making love, a thing they would enjoy doing,\n      whilst mercenary girls do it too much and without getting any enjoyment\n      out of it. It is indeed deplorable. But M. Leon Blum need not fret too\n      much. If the evil exists, as he says it does, in our middle-class society,\n      I can assure him that everywhere else he would see a consoling spectacle.\n      Among the people, the mass of the people through town and country, girls\n      do not deny themselves that pleasure.\"",
                "\"It is depravity!\" said Madame Cremeur.",
                "And she praised the innocence of young girls in terms full of modesty and\n      grace. It was charming to hear her.",
                "Professor Haddock's views on the same subject were, on the contrary,\n      painful to listen to.",
                "\"Respectable young girls,\" said he, \"are guarded and watched over.\n      Besides, men do not, as a rule, pursue them much, either through probity,\n      or from a fear of grave responsibilities, or because the seduction of a\n      young girl would not be to their credit. Even then we do not know what\n      really takes place, for the reason that what is hidden is not seen. This\n      is a condition necessary to the existence of all society. The scruples of\n      respectable young girls could be more easily overcome than those of\n      married women if the same pressure were brought to bear on them, and for\n      this there are two reasons: they have more illusions, and their curiosity\n      has not been satisfied. Women, for the most part, have been so\n      disappointed by their husbands that they have not courage enough to begin\n      again with somebody else. I myself have been met by this obstacle several\n      times in my attempts at seduction.\"",
                "At the moment when Professor Haddock ended his unpleasant remarks,\n      Mademoiselle Eveline Clarence entered the drawing-room and listlessly\n      handed about tea with that expression of boredom which gave an oriental\n      charm to her beauty.",
                "\"For my part,\" said Hippolyte Ceres, looking at her, \"I declare myself the\n      young ladies' champion.\"",
                "\"He must be a fool,\" thought the girl.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres, who had never set foot outside of his political world of\n      electors and elected, thought Madame Clarence's drawing-room most select,\n      its mistress exquisite, and her daughter amazingly beautiful. His visits\n      became frequent and he paid court to both of them. Madame Clarence, who\n      now liked attention, thought him agreeable. Eveline showed no friendliness\n      towards him, and treated him with a hauteur and disdain that he took for\n      aristocratic behaviour and fashionable manners, and he thought all the\n      more of her on that account. This busy man taxed his ingenuity to please\n      them, and he sometimes succeeded. He got them cards for fashionable\n      functions and boxes at the Opera. He furnished Mademoiselle Clarence with\n      several opportunities of appearing to great advantage and in particular at\n      a garden party which, although given by a Minister, was regarded as really\n      fashionable, and gained its first success in society circles for the\n      Republic.",
                "At that party Eveline had been much noticed and had attracted the special\n      attention of a young diplomat called Roger Lambilly who, imagining that\n      she belonged to a rather fast set, invited her to his bachelor's flat. She\n      thought him handsome and believed him rich, and she accepted. A little\n      moved, almost disquieted, she very nearly became the victim of her daring,\n      and only avoided defeat by an offensive measure audaciously carried out.\n      This was the most foolish escapade in her unmarried life.",
                "Being now on friendly terms with Ministers and with the President, Eveline\n      continued to wear her aristocratic and pious affectations, and these won\n      for her the sympathy of the chief personages in the anti-clerical and\n      democratic Republic. M. Hippolyte Ceres, seeing that she was succeeding\n      and doing him credit, liked her still more. He even went so far as to fall\n      madly in love with her.",
                "Henceforth, in spite of everything, she began to observe him with\n      interest, being curious to see if his passion would increase. He appeared\n      to her without elegance or grace, and not well bred, but active,\n      clear-sighted, full of resource, and not too great a bore. She still made\n      fun of him, but he had now won her interest.",
                "One day she wished to test him. It was during the elections, when members\n      of Parliament were, as the phrase runs, requesting a renewal of their\n      mandates. He had an opponent, who, though not dangerous at first and not\n      much of an orator, was rich and was reported to be gaining votes every\n      day. Hippolyte Ceres, banishing both dull security and foolish alarm from\n      his mind, redoubled his care. His chief method of action was by public\n      meetings at which he spoke vehemently against the rival candidate. His\n      committee held huge meetings on Saturday evenings and at three o'clock on\n      Sunday afternoons. One Sunday, as he called on the Clarences, he found\n      Eveline alone in the drawing-room. He had been chatting for about twenty\n      or twenty-five minutes, when, taking out his watch, he saw that it was a\n      quarter to three. The young girl showed herself amiable, engaging,\n      attractive, and full of promises. Ceres was fascinated, but he stood up to\n      go.",
                "\"Stay a little longer,\" said she in a pressing and agreeable voice which\n      made him promptly sit down again.",
                "She was full of interest, of abandon, curiosity, and weakness. He blushed,\n      turned pale, and again got up.",
                "Then, in order to keep him still longer, she looked at him out of two grey\n      and melting eyes, and though her bosom was heaving, she did not say\n      another word. He fell at her feet in distraction, but once more looking at\n      his watch, he jumped up with a terrible oath.",
                "\"D -- ! a quarter to four! I must be off.\"",
                "And immediately he rushed down the stairs.",

She was, moreover, very reserved with him, and that not solely from\n      any want of inclination to be otherwise, since in affairs of love some\n      things are due to indifference, to inattention, to woman's instinct, to\n      traditional custom and feeling, to a desire to try one's power, and to\n      satisfaction at seeing its results. The reason of her prudence was that\n      she knew him to be very much infatuated and capable of taking advantage of\n      any familiarities she allowed as well as of reproaching her coarsely\n      afterwards if she discontinued them.",
                "As he was a professed anti-clerical and free-thinker, she thought it a\n      good plan to affect an appearance of piety in his presence and to be seen\n      with prayer-books bound in red morocco, such as Queen Marie Leczinska's or\n      the Dauphiness Marie Josephine's \"The Last Two Weeks of Lent.\" She lost no\n      opportunity, either, of showing him the subscriptions that she collected\n      for the endowment of the national cult of St. Orberosia. Eveline did not\n      act in this way because she wished to tease him. Nor did it spring from a\n      young girl's archness, or a spirit of constraint, or even from\n      snobbishness, though there was more than a suspicion of this latter in her\n      behaviour. It was but her way of asserting herself, of stamping herself\n      with a definite character, of increasing her value. To rouse the Deputy's\n      courage she wrapped herself up in religion, just as Brunhild surrounded\n      herself with flames so as to attract Sigurd. Her audacity was successful.\n      He thought her still more beautiful thus. Clericalism was in his eyes a\n      sign of good form.",
                "Ceres was re-elected by an enormous majority and returned to a House which\n      showed itself more inclined to the Left, more advanced, and, as it seemed,\n      more eager for reform than its predecessor. Perceiving at once that so\n      much zeal was but intended to hide a fear of change, and a sincere desire\n      to do nothing, he determined to adopt a policy that would satisfy these\n      aspirations. At the beginning of the session he made a great speech,\n      cleverly thought out and well arranged, dealing with the idea that all\n      reform ought to be put off for a long time. He showed himself heated, even\n      fervid; holding the principle that an orator should recommend moderation\n      with extreme vehemence. He was applauded by the entire assembly. The\n      Clarences listened to him from the President's box and Eveline trembled in\n      spite of herself at the solemn sound of the applause. On the same bench\n      the fair Madame Pensee shivered at the intonations of his virile voice.",
                "As soon as he descended from the tribune, Ceres, even while the audience\n      were still clapping, went without a moment's delay to salute the Clarences\n      in their box. Eveline saw in him the beauty of success, and as he leaned\n      towards the ladies, wiping his neck with his handkerchief and receiving\n      their congratulations with an air of modesty though not without a tinge of\n      self-conceit, the young girl glanced towards Madame Pensee and saw her,\n      palpitating and breathless, drinking in the hero's applause with her head\n      thrown backwards. It seemed as if she were on the point of fainting.\n      Eveline immediately smiled tenderly on M. Ceres.",
                "The Alcan deputy's speech had a great vogue. In political \"spheres\" it was\n      regarded as extremely able. \"We have at last heard an honest\n      pronouncement,\" said the chief Moderate journal. \"It is a regular\n      programme!\" they said in the House. It was agreed that he was a man of\n      immense talent.",

He thus found\n      himself marked out for office in the next ministerial combination.",
                "After a long hesitation Eveline Clarence accepted the idea of marrying M.\n      Hippolyte Ceres. The great man was a little common for her taste. Nothing\n      had yet proved that he would one day reach the point where politics bring\n      in large sums of money. But she was entering her twenty-seventh year and\n      knew enough of life to see that she must not be too fastidious or show\n      herself too difficult to please.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres was celebrated; Hippolyte Ceres was happy. He was no\n      longer recognisable; the elegance of his clothes and deportment had\n      increased tremendously. He wore an undue number of white gloves. Now that\n      he was too much of a society man, Eveline began to doubt if it was not\n      worse than being too little of one.

Hippolyte\n      Ceres, tolerant but a free-thinker, wanted only a civil marriage. There\n      were many discussions and even some violent scenes upon the subject. The\n      last took place in the young girl's room at the moment when the\n      invitations were being written. Eveline declared that if she did not go to\n      church she would not believe herself married. She spoke of breaking off\n      the engagement, and of going abroad with her mother, or of retiring into a\n      convent. Then she became tender, weak, suppliant. She sighed, and\n      everything in her virginal chamber sighed in chorus, the holy-water font,\n      the palm-branch above her white bed, the books of devotion on their little\n      shelves, and the blue and white statuette of St. Orberosia chaining the\n      dragon of Cappadocia, that stood upon the marble mantelpiece. Hippolyte\n      Ceres was moved, softened, melted.",
                "Beautiful in her grief, her eyes shining with tears, her wrists girt by a\n      rosary of lapis lazuli and, so to speak, chained by her faith, she\n      suddenly flung herself at Hippolyte's feet, and dishevelled, almost dying,\n      she embraced his knees.",

Still I'll explain it to them . . . toleration, social\n      necessities . . . .

Now that she is persecuted, the\n      shadow of the crypts and the recesses of the catacombs are in better\n      accord with her festivals. Mademoiselle, when you have performed the civil\n      formalities come here to my private chapel in costume with M. Ceres. I\n      will marry you, a observe the most absolute discretion.

                "V. THE VISIRE CABINET",
                "The Ceres household was established with modest decency in a pretty flat\n      situated in a new building. Ceres loved his wife in a calm and tranquil\n      fashion. He was often kept late from home by the Commission on the Budget\n      and he worked more than three nights a week at a report on the postal\n      finances of which he hoped to make a masterpiece. Eveline thought she\n      could twist him round her finger, and this did not displease him. The bad\n      side of their situation was that they had not much money; in truth they\n      had very little. The servants of the Republic do not grow rich in her\n      service as easily as people think. Since the sovereign is no longer there\n      to distribute favours, each of them takes what he can, and his\n      depredations, limited by the depredations of all the others, are reduced\n      to modest proportions. Hence that austerity of morals that is noticed in\n      democratic leaders. They can only grow rich during periods of great\n      business activity and then they find themselves exposed to the envy of\n      their less favoured colleagues. Hippolyte Ceres had for a long time\n      foreseen such a period. He was one of those who had made preparations for\n      its arrival. Whilst waiting for it he endured his poverty with dignity,\n      and Eveline shared that poverty without suffering as much as one might\n      have thought. She was in close intimacy with the Reverend Father Douillard\n      and frequented the chapel of St. Orberosia, where she met with serious\n      society and people in a position to render her useful services. She knew\n      how to choose among them and gave her confidence to none but those who\n      deserved it. She had gained experience since her motor excursions with\n      Viscount Clena, and above all she had now acquired the value of a married\n      woman.",
                "The deputy was at first uneasy about these pious practices, which were\n      ridiculed by the demagogic newspapers, but he was soon reassured, for he\n      saw all around him democratic leaders joyfully becoming reconciled to the\n      aristocracy and the Church.",
                "They found that they had reached one of those periods (which often recur)\n      when advance had been carried a little too far. Hippolyte Ceres gave a\n      moderate support to this view. His policy was not a policy of persecution\n      but a policy of tolerance. He had laid its foundations in his splendid\n      speech on the preparations for reform. The Prime Minister was looked upon\n      as too advanced. He proposed schemes which were admitted to be dangerous\n      to capital, and the great financial companies were opposed to him. Of\n      course it followed that the papers of all views supported the companies.\n      Seeing the danger increasing, the Cabinet abandoned its schemes, its\n      programme, and its opinions, but it was too late. A new administration was\n      already ready. An insidious question by Paul Visire which was immediately\n      made the subject of a resolution, and a fine speech by Hippolyte Ceres,\n      overthrew the Cabinet.",
                "The President of the Republic entrusted the formation of a new Cabinet to\n      this same Paul Visire, who, though still very young, had been a Minister\n      twice. He was a charming man, spending much of his time in the green-rooms\n      of theatres, very artistic, a great society man, of amazing ability and\n      industry. Paul Visire formed a temporary ministry intended to reassure\n      public feeling which had taken alarm, and Hippolyte Ceres was invited to\n      hold office in it.",
                "The new ministry, belonging to all the groups in the majority, represented\n      the most diverse and contrary opinions, but they were all moderate and\n      convinced conservatives.* The Minister of Foreign Affairs was retained\n      from the former cabinet. He was a little dark man called Crombile, who\n      worked fourteen hours a day with the conviction that he dealt with\n      tremendous questions. He refused to see even his own diplomatic agents,\n      and was terribly uneasy, though he did not disturb anybody else, for the\n      want of foresight of peoples is infinite and that of governments is just\n      as great.",
                "* As this ministry exercised considerable influence upon the\n     destinies of the country and of the world, we think it well\n     to give its composition: Minister of the Interior and Prime\n     Minister, Paul Visire; Minister of Justice, Pierre Bouc;\n     Foreign Affairs, Victor Crombile; Finance, Terrasson;\n     Education, Labillette; Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs,\n     Hippolyte Ceres; Agriculture, Aulac; Public Works,\n     Lapersonne; War, General Debonnaire; Admiralty, Admiral\n     Vivier des Murenes.",
                "The office of Public Works was given to a Socialist, Fortune Lapersonne.\n      It was then a political custom and one of the most solemn, most severe,\n      most rigorous, and if I may dare say so, the most terrible and cruel of\n      all political customs, to include a member of the Socialist party in each\n      ministry intended to oppose Socialism, so that the enemies of wealth and\n      property should suffer the shame of being attacked by one of their own\n      party, and so that they could not unite against these forces without\n      turning to some one who might possibly attack themselves in the future.\n      Nothing but a profound ignorance of the human heart would permit the\n      belief that it was difficult to find a Socialist to occupy these\n      functions. Citizen Fortune Lapersonne entered the Visire cabinet of his\n      own free will and without any constraint; and he found those who approved\n      of his action even among his former friends, so great was the fascination\n      that power exercised over the Penguins!",
                "General Debonnaire went to the War Office. He was looked upon as one of\n      the ablest generals in the army, but he was ruled by a woman, the Baroness\n      Bildermann, who, though she had reached the age of intrigue, was still\n      beautiful. She was in the pay of a neighbouring and hostile Power.",
                "The new Minister of Marine, the worthy Admiral Vivier des Murenes, was\n      generally regarded as an excellent seaman. He displayed a piety that would\n      have seemed excessive in an anti-clerical minister, if the Republic had\n      not recognised that religion was of great maritime utility. Acting on the\n      instruction of his spiritual director, the Reverend Father Douillard, the\n      worthy Admiral had dedicated his fleet to St. Orberosia and directed\n      canticles in honour of the Alcan Virgin to be composed by Christian bards.\n      These replaced the national hymn in the music played by the navy.",
                "Prime Minister Visire declared himself to be distinctly anticlerical but\n      ready to respect all creeds; he asserted that he was a sober-minded\n      reformer. Paul Visire and his colleagues desired reforms, and it was in\n      order not to compromise reform that they proposed none; for they were true\n      politicians and knew that reforms are compromised the moment they are\n      proposed. The government was well received, respectable people were\n      reassured, and the funds rose.",
                "The administration announced that four new ironclads would be put into\n      commission, that prosecutions would be undertaken against the Socialists,\n      and it formally declared its intention to have nothing to do with any\n      inquisitorial income-tax. The choice of Terrasson as Minister of Finance\n      was warmly approved by the press. Terrasson, an old minister famous for\n      his financial operations, gave warrant to all the hopes of the financiers\n      and shadowed forth a period of great business activity. Soon those three\n      udders of modern nations, monopolies, bill discounting, and fraudulent\n      speculation, were swollen with the milk of wealth. Already whispers were\n      heard of distant enterprises, and of planting colonies, and the boldest\n      put forward in the newspapers the project of a military and financial\n      protectorate over Nigritia.",
                "Without having yet shown what he was capable of, Hippolyte Ceres was\n      considered a man of weight. Business people thought highly of him. He was\n      congratulated on all sides for having broken with the extreme sections,\n      the dangerous men, and for having realised the responsibilities of\n      government.",
                "Madame Ceres shone alone amid the Ministers' wives. Crombile withered away\n      in bachelordom. Paul Visire had married money in the person of\n      Mademoiselle Blampignon, an accomplished, estimable, and simple lady who\n      was always ill, and whose feeble health compelled her to stay with her\n      mother in the depths of a remote province. The other Ministers' wives were\n      not born to charm the sight, and people smiled when they read that Madame\n      Labillette had appeared at the Presidency Ball wearing a headdress of\n      birds of paradise. Madame Vivier des Murenes, a woman of good family, was\n      stout rather than tall, had a face like a beef-steak and the voice of a\n      newspaper-seller. Madame Debonnaire, tall, dry, and florid, was devoted to\n      young officers. She ruined herself by her escapades and crimes and only\n      regained consideration by dint of ugliness and insolence.",
                "Madame Ceres was the charm of the Ministry and its tide to consideration.\n      Young, beautiful, and irreproachable, she charmed alike society and the\n      masses by her combination of elegant costumes and pleasant smiles.",
                "Her receptions were thronged by the great Jewish financiers. She gave the\n      most fashionable garden parties in the Republic. The newspapers described\n      her dresses and the milliners did not ask her to pay for them. She went to\n      Mass; she protected the chapel of St. Orberosia from the ill-will of the\n      people; and she aroused in aristocratic hearts the hope of a fresh\n      Concordat.",
                "With her golden hair, grey eyes, and supple and slight though rounded\n      figure, she was indeed pretty. She enjoyed an excellent reputation and she\n      was so adroit, and calm, so much mistress of herself, that she would have\n      preserved it intact even if she had been discovered in the very act of\n      ruining it.",
                "The session ended with a victory for the cabinet which, amid the almost\n      unanimous applause of the House, defeated a proposal for an inquisitorial\n      tax, and with a triumph for Madame Ceres who gave parties in honour of\n      three kings who were at the moment passing through Alca."

                "The Prime Minister invited Monsieur and Madame Ceres to spend a couple of\n      weeks of the holidays in a little villa that he had taken in the\n      mountains, and in which he lived alone. The deplorable health of Madame\n      Paul Visire did not allow her to accompany her husband, and she remained\n      with her relatives in one of the southern provinces.",
                "The villa had belonged to the mistress of one of the last Kings of Alca:\n      the drawing-room retained its old furniture, and in it was still to be\n      found the Sofa of the Favourite. The country was charming; a pretty blue\n      stream, the Aiselle, flowed at the foot of the hill that dominated the\n      villa. Hippolyte Ceres loved fishing; when engaged at this monotonous\n      occupation he often formed his best Parliamentary combinations, and his\n      happiest oratorical inspirations. Trout swarmed in the Aiselle; he fished\n      it from morning till evening in a boat that the Prime Minister readily\n      placed at is disposal.",
                "In the mean time, Eveline and Paul Visire sometimes took a turn together\n      in the garden, or had a little chat in the drawing-room. Eveline, although\n      she recognised the attraction that Visire had for women, had hitherto\n      displayed towards him only an intermittent and superficial coquetry,\n      without any deep intentions or settled design. He was a connoisseur and\n      saw that she was pretty. The House and the Opera had deprived him of all\n      leisure, but, in a little villa, the grey eyes and rounded figure of\n      Eveline took on a value in his eyes. One day as Hippolyte Ceres was\n      fishing in the Aiselle, he made her sit beside him on the Sofa of the\n      Favourite. Long rays of gold struck Eveline like arrows from a hidden\n      Cupid through the chinks of the curtains which protected her from the heat\n      and glare of a brilliant day. Beneath her white muslin dress her rounded\n      yet slender form was outlined in its grace and youth. Her skin was cool\n      and fresh, and had the fragrance of freshly mown hay. Paul Visire behaved\n      as the occasion warranted, and for her part, she was opposed neither to\n      the games of chance or of society. She believed it would be nothing or a\n      trifle; she was mistaken.",
                "\"There was,\" says the famous German ballad, \"on the sunny side of the town\n      square, beside a wall whereon the creeper grew, a pretty little\n      letter-box, as blue as the corn-flowers, smiling and tranquil.",
                "\"All day long there came to it, in their heavy shoes, small shop-keepers,\n      rich farmers, citizens, the tax-collector and the policeman, and they put\n      into it their business letters, their invoices, their summonses their\n      notices to pay taxes, the judges' returns, and orders for the recruits to\n      assemble. It remained smiling and tranquil.",
                "\"With joy, or in anxiety, there advanced towards it workmen and farm\n      servants, maids and nursemaids, accountants, clerks, and women carrying\n      their little children in their arms; they put into it notifications of\n      births, marriages, and deaths, letters between engaged couples, between\n      husbands and wives, from mothers to their sons, and from sons to their\n      mothers. It remained smiling and tranquil.",
                "\"At twilight, young lads and young girls slipped furtively to it, and put\n      in love-letters, some moistened with tears that blotted the ink, others\n      with a little circle to show the place to kiss, all of them very long. It\n      remained smiling and tranquil.",
                "\"Rich merchants came themselves through excess of carefulness at the hour\n      of daybreak, and put into it registered letters, and letters with five red\n      seals, full of bank notes or cheques on the great financial establishments\n      of the Empire. It remained smiling and tranquil.",
                "\"But one day, Gaspar, whom it had never seen, and whom it did not know\n      from Adam, came to put in a letter, of which nothing is known but that it\n      was folded like a little hat. Immediately the pretty letter-box fell into\n      a swoon. Henceforth it remains no longer in its place; it runs through\n      streets, fields, and woods, girdled with ivy, and crowned with roses. It\n      keeps running up hill and down dale; the country policeman surprises it\n      sometimes, amidst the corn, in Gaspar's arms kissing him upon the mouth.\"",
                "Paul Visire had recovered all his customary nonchalance. Eveline remained\n      stretched on the Divan of the Favourite in an attitude of delicious\n      astonishment.",
                "The Reverend Father Douillard, an excellent moral theologian, and a man\n      who in the decadence of the Church has preserved his principles, was very\n      right to teach, in conformity with the doctrine of the Fathers, that while\n      a woman commits a great sin by giving herself for money, she commits a\n      much greater one by giving herself for nothing. For, in the first case she\n      acts to support her life, and that is sometimes not merely excusable but\n      pardonable, and even worthy of the Divine Grace, for God forbids suicide,\n      and is unwilling that his creatures should destroy themselves. Besides, in\n      giving herself in order to live, she remains humble, and derives no\n      pleasure from it a thing which diminishes the sin. But a woman who gives\n      herself for nothing sins with pleasure and exults in her fault. The pride\n      and delight with which she burdens her crime increase its load of moral\n      guilt.",
                "Madame Hippolyte Ceres' example shows the profundity of these moral\n      truths. She perceived that she had senses. A second was enough to bring\n      about this discovery, to change her soul, to alter her whole life. To have\n      learned to know herself was at first a delight. The {greek here} of the\n      ancient philosophy is not a precept the moral fulfilment of which procures\n      any pleasure, since one enjoys little satisfaction from knowing one's\n      soul. It is not the same with the flesh, for in it sources of pleasure may\n      be revealed to us. Eveline immediately felt an obligation to her revealer\n      equal to the benefit she had received, and she imagined that he who had\n      discovered these heavenly depths was the sole possessor of the key to\n      them. Was this an error, and might she not be able to find others who also\n      had the golden key? It is difficult to decide; and Professor Haddock, when\n      the facts were divulged (which happened without much delay as we shall\n      see), treated the matter from an experimental point of view, in a\n      scientific review, and concluded that the chances Madame C --  would\n      have of finding the exact equivalent of M. V --  were in the proportion\n      of 305 to 975008. This is as much as to say that she would never find it.\n      Doubtless her instinct told her the same, for she attached herself\n      distractedly to him.",
                "I have related these facts with all the circumstances which seemed to me\n      worthy of attracting the attention of meditative and philosophic minds.\n      The Sofa of the Favourite is worthy of the majesty of history; on it were\n      decided the destinies of a great people; nay, on it was accomplished an\n      act whose renown was to extend over the neighbouring nations both friendly\n      and hostile, and even over all humanity. Too often events of this nature\n      escape the superficial minds and shallow spirits who inconsiderately\n      assume the task of writing history. Thus the secret springs of events\n      remain hidden from us. The fall of Empires and the transmission of\n      dominions astonish us and remain incomprehensible to us, because we have\n      not discovered the imperceptible point, or touched the secret spring which\n      when put in movement has destroyed and overthrown everything. The author\n      of this great history knows better than anyone else his faults and his\n      weaknesses, but he can do himself this justice -- that he has always\n      kept the moderation, the seriousness, the austerity, which an account of\n      affairs of State demands, and that he has never departed from the gravity\n      which is suitable to a recital of human actions."

He had had a good deal to do\n      with women and knew that they readily say these things to men in order to\n      make them more in love with them. Thus his experience, as sometimes\n      happens, made him disregard the truth. Incredulous, but gratified all the\n      same, he soon felt love and something more for her. This state at first\n      seemed favourable to his intellectual faculties. Visire delivered in the\n      chief town of his constituency a speech full of grace, brilliant and\n      happy, which was considered to be a masterpiece.",
                "The re-opening of Parliament was serene. A few isolated jealousies, a few\n      timid ambitions raised their heads in the House, and that was all. A smile\n      from the Prime Minister was enough to dissipate these shadows. She and he\n      saw each other twice a day, and wrote to each other in the interval. He\n      was accustomed to intimate relationships, was adroit, and knew how to\n      dissimulate; but Eveline displayed a foolish imprudence: she made herself\n      conspicuous with him in drawing-rooms, at the theatre, in the House, and\n      at the Embassies; she wore her love upon her face, upon her whole person,\n      in her moist glances, in the languishing smile of her lips, in the heaving\n      of her breast, in all her heightened, agitated, and distracted beauty.\n      Soon the entire country knew of their intimacy. Foreign Courts were\n      informed of it. The President of the Republic and Eveline's husband alone\n      remained in ignorance. The President became acquainted with it in the\n      country, through a misplaced police report which found its way, it is not\n      known how, into his portmanteau.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres, without being either very subtle, or very perspicacious,\n      noticed that there was something different in his home. Eveline, who quite\n      lately had interested herself in his affairs, and shown, if not\n      tenderness, at least affection, towards him, displayed henceforth nothing\n      but indifference and repulsion. She had always had periods of absence, and\n      made prolonged visits to the Charity of St. Orberosia; now, she went out\n      in the morning, remained out all day, and sat down to dinner at nine\n      o'clock in the evening with the face of a somnambulist. Her husband\n      thought it absurd; however, he might perhaps have never known the reason\n      for this; a profound ignorance of women, a crass confidence in his own\n      merit, and in his own fortune, might perhaps have always hidden the truth\n      from him, if the two lovers had not, so to speak, compelled him to\n      discover it.",
                "When Paul Visire went to Eveline's house and found her alone, they used to\n      say, as they embraced each other; \"Not here! not here!\" and immediately\n      they affected an extreme reserve. That was their invariable rule. Now, one\n      day, Paul Visire went to the house of his colleague Ceres, with whom he\n      had an engagement. It was Eveline who received him, the Minister of\n      Commerce being delayed by a commission.",
                "\"Not here!\" said the lovers, smiling.",
                "They said it, mouth to mouth, embracing, and clasping each other. They\n      were still saying it, when Hippolyte Ceres entered the drawing-room.",
                "Paul Visire did not lose his presence of mind. He declared to Madame Ceres\n      that he would give up his attempt to take the dust out of her eye. By this\n      attitude he did not deceive the husband, but he was able to leave the room\n      with some dignity.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres was thunderstruck. Eveline's conduct appeared\n      incomprehensible to him; he asked her what reasons she had for it.",
                "\"Why? why?\" he kept repeating continually, \"why?\"",
                "She denied everything, not to convince him, for he had seen them, but from\n      expediency and good taste, and to avoid painful explanations. Hippolyte\n      Ceres suffered all the tortures of jealousy. He admitted it to himself, he\n      kept saying inwardly, \"I am a strong man; I am clad in armour; but the\n      wound is underneath, it is in my heart,\" and turning towards his wife, who\n      looked beautiful in her guilt, he would say:",
                "\"It ought not to have been with him.\"",
                "He was right -- Eveline ought not to have loved in government circles.",
                "He suffered so much that he took up his revolver, exclaiming: \"I will go\n      and kill him!\" But he remembered that a Minister of Commerce cannot kill\n      his own Prime Minister, and he put his revolver back into his drawer.",
                "The weeks passed without calming his sufferings. Each morning he buckled\n      his strong man's armour over his wound and sought in work and fame the\n      peace that fled from him. Every Sunday he inaugurated busts, statues,\n      fountains, artesian wells, hospitals, dispensaries, railways, canals,\n      public markets, drainage systems, triumphal arches, and slaughter houses,\n      and delivered moving speeches on each of these occasions. His fervid\n      activity devoured whole piles of documents; he changed the colours of the\n      postage stamps fourteen times in one week. Nevertheless, he gave vent to\n      outbursts of grief and rage that drove him insane; for whole days his\n      reason abandoned him. If he had been in the employment of a private\n      administration this would have been noticed immediately, but it is much\n      more difficult to discover insanity or frenzy in the conduct of affairs of\n      State. At that moment the government employees were forming themselves\n      into associations and federations amid a ferment that was giving alarm\n      both to the Parliament and to public feeling. The postmen were especially\n      prominent in their enthusiasm for trade unions.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres informed them in a circular that their action was strictly\n      legal. The following day he sent out a second circular forbidding all\n      associations of government employees as illegal. He dismissed one hundred\n      and eighty postmen, reinstated them, reprimanded them -- and awarded\n      them gratuities. At Cabinet councils he was always on the point of\n      bursting forth. The presence of the Head of the State scarcely restrained\n      him within the limits of the decencies, and as he did not dare to attack\n      his rival he consoled himself by heaping invectives upon General\n      Debonnaire, the respected Minister of War. The General did not hear them,\n      for he was deaf and occupied himself in composing verses for the Baroness\n      Bildermann. Hippolyte Ceres offered an indistinct opposition to everything\n      the Prime Minister proposed. In a word, he was a madman. One faculty alone\n      escaped the ruin of his intellect: he retained his Parliamentary sense,\n      his consciousness of the temper of majorities, his thorough knowledge of\n      groups, and his certainty of the direction in which affairs were moving."

                "VIII. FURTHER CONSEQUENCES",
                "The session ended calmly, and the Ministry saw no dangerous signs upon the\n      benches where the majority sat. It was visible, however, from certain\n      articles in the Moderate journals, that the demands of the Jewish and\n      Christian financiers were increasing daily, that the patriotism of the\n      banks required a civilizing expedition to Nigritia, and that the steel\n      trusts, eager in the defence of our coasts and colonies, were crying out\n      for armoured cruisers and still more armoured cruisers. Rumours of war\n      began to be heard. Such rumours sprang up every year as regularly as the\n      trade winds; serious people paid no heed to them and the government\n      usually let them die away from their own weakness unless they grew\n      stronger and spread. For in that case the country would be alarmed. The\n      financiers only wanted colonial wars and the people did not want any wars\n      at all. It loved to see its government proud and even insolent, but at the\n      least suspicion that a European war was brewing, its violent emotion would\n      quickly have reached the House. Paul Visire was not uneasy. The European\n      situation was in his view completely reassuring. He was only irritated by\n      the maniacal silence of his Minister of Foreign Affairs. That gnome went\n      to the Cabinet meetings with a portfolio bigger than himself stuffed full\n      of papers, said nothing, refused to answer all questions, even those asked\n      him by the respected President of the Republic, and, exhausted by his\n      obstinate labours, took a few moments' sleep in his arm-chair in which\n      nothing but the top of his little black head was to be seen above the\n      green tablecloth.",
                "In the mean time Hippolyte Ceres became a strong man again. In company\n      with his colleague Lapersonne he formed numerous intimacies with ladies of\n      the theatre. They were both to be seen at night entering fashionable\n      restaurants in the company of ladies whom they over-topped by their lofty\n      stature and their new hats, and they were soon reckoned amongst the most\n      sympathetic frequenters of the boulevards. Fortune Lapersonne had his own\n      wound beneath his armour, His wife, a young milliner whom he carried off\n      from a marquis, had gone to live with a chauffeur. He loved her still, and\n      could not console himself for her loss, so that very often in the private\n      room of a restaurant, in the midst of a group of girls who laughed and ate\n      crayfish, the two ministers exchanged a look full of their common sorrow\n      and wiped away an unbidden tear.",
                "Hippolyte Ceres, although wounded to the heart, did not allow himself to\n      be beaten. He swore that he would be avenged.",
                "Madame Paul Visire, whose deplorable health forced her to live with her\n      relatives in a distant province, received an anonymous letter specifying\n      that M. Paul Visire, who had not a half-penny when he married her, was\n      spending her dowry on a married woman, E --  C -- , that he gave\n      this woman thirty-thousand-franc motor-cars, and pearl necklaces costing\n      twenty-five thousand francs, and that he was going straight to dishonour\n      and ruin. Madame Paul Visire read the letter, fell into hysterics, and\n      handed it to her father.",
                "\"I am going to box your husband's ears,\" said M. Blampignon; \"he is a\n      blackguard who will land you both in the workhouse unless we look out. He\n      may be Prime Minister, but he won't frighten me.\"",
                "When he stepped off the train M. Blampignon presented himself at the\n      Ministry of the Interior, and was immediately received. He entered the\n      Prime Minister's room in a fury.",
                "\"I have something to say to you, sir!\" And he waved the anonymous letter.",
                "Paul Visire welcomed him smiling.",
                "\"You are welcome, my dear father. I was going to write to you. . . . Yes,\n      to tell you of your nomination to the rank of officer of the Legion of\n      Honour. I signed the patent this morning.\"",
                "M. Blampignon thanked his son-in-law warmly and threw the anonymous letter\n      into the fire.",
                "He returned to his provincial house and found his daughter fretting and\n      agitated.",
                "\"Well! I saw your husband. He is a delightful fellow. But then, you don't\n      understand how to deal with him.\"",
                "About this time Hippolyte Ceres learned through a little scandalous\n      newspaper (it is always through the newspapers that ministers are informed\n      of the affairs of State) that the Prime Minister dined every evening with\n      Mademoiselle Lysiane of the Folies Dramatiques, whose charm seemed to have\n      made a great impression on him. Thenceforth Ceres took a gloomy joy in\n      watching his wife. She came in every evening to dine or dress with an air\n      of agreeable fatigue and the serenity that comes from enjoyment.",
                "Thinking that she knew nothing, he sent her anonymous communications. She\n      read them at the table before him and remained still listless and smiling.",
                "He then persuaded himself that she gave no heed to these vague reports,\n      and that in order to disturb her it would be necessary to enable her to\n      verify her lover's infidelity and treason for herself. There were at the\n      Ministry a number of trustworthy agents charged with secret inquiries\n      regarding the national defence. They were then employed in watching the\n      spies of a neighbouring and hostile Power who had succeeded in entering\n      the Postal and Telegraphic service. M. Ceres ordered them to suspend their\n      work for the present and to inquire where, when, and how, the Minister of\n      the Interior saw Mademoiselle Lysiane. The agents performed their missions\n      faithfully and told the minister that they had several times seen the\n      Prime Minister with a woman, but that she was not Mademoiselle Lysiane.\n      Hippolyte Ceres asked them nothing further. He was right; the loves of\n      Paul Visire and Lysiane were but an alibi invented by Paul Visire himself,\n      with Eveline's approval, for his fame was rather inconvenient to her, and\n      she sighed for secrecy and mystery.",
                "They were not shadowed by the agents of the Ministry of Commerce alone.\n      They were also followed by those of the Prefect of Police, and even by\n      those of the Minister of the Interior, who disputed with each other the\n      honour of protecting their chief. Then there were the emissaries of\n      several royalist, imperialist, and clerical organisations, those of eight\n      or ten blackmailers, several amateur detectives, a multitude of reporters,\n      and a crowd of photographers, who all made their appearance wherever these\n      two took refuge in their perambulating love affairs, at big hotels, small\n      hotels, town houses, country houses, private apartments, villas, museums,\n      palaces, hovels. They kept watch in the streets, from neighbouring houses,\n      trees, walls, stair-cases, landings, roofs, adjoining rooms, and even\n      chimneys. The Minister and his friend saw with alarm all round their bed\n      room, gimlets boring through doors and shutters, and drills making holes\n      in the walls. A photograph of Madame Ceres in night attire buttoning her\n      boots was the utmost that had been obtained.",
                "Paul Visire grew impatient and irritable, and often lost his good humour\n      and agreeableness. He came to the cabinet meetings in a rage and he, too,\n      poured invectives upon General Debonnaire -- a brave man under fire but\n      a lax disciplinarian -- and launched his sarcasms at against the\n      venerable admiral Vivier des Murenes whose ships went to the bottom\n      without any apparent reason.",
                "Fortune Lapersonne listened open-eyed, and grumbled scoffingly between his\n      teeth:",
                "\"He is not satisfied with robbing Hippolyte Ceres of his wife, but he must\n      go and rob him of his catchwords too.\"",
                "These storms were made known by the indiscretion of some ministers and by\n      the complaints of the two old warriors, who declared their intention of\n      flinging their portfolios at the beggar's head, but who did nothing of the\n      sort. These outbursts, far from injuring the lucky Prime Minister, had an\n      excellent effect on Parliament and public opinion, who looked on them as\n      signs of a keen solicitude for the welfare of the national army and navy.\n      The Prime Minister was the recipient of general approbation.",
                "To the congratulations of the various groups and of notable personages, he\n      replied with simple firmness: \"Those are my principles!\" and he had seven\n      or eight Socialists put in prison.",
                "The session ended, and Paul Visire, very exhausted, went to take the\n      waters. Hippolyte Ceres refused to leave his Ministry, where the trade\n      union of telephone girls was in tumultuous agitation. He opposed it with\n      an unheard of violence, for he had now become a woman-hater. On Sundays he\n      went into the suburbs to fish along with his colleague Lapersonne, wearing\n      the tall hat that never left him since he had become a Minister. And both\n      of them, forgetting the fish, complained of the inconstancy of women and\n      mingled their griefs.",
                "Hippolyte still loved Eveline and he still suffered. However, hope had\n      slipped into his heart. She was now separated from her lover, and,\n      thinking to win her back, he directed all his efforts to that end. He put\n      forth all his skill, showed himself sincere, adaptable, affectionate,\n      devoted, even discreet; his heart taught him the delicacies of feeling. He\n      said charming and touching things to the faithless one, and, to soften\n      her, he told her all that he had suffered.",
                "Crossing the band of his trousers upon his stomach.",
                "\"See,\" said he, \"how thin I have got.\"",
                "He promised her everything he thought could gratify a woman, country\n      parties, hats, jewels.",
                "Sometimes he thought she would take pity on him.",
                "She no longer displayed an insolently happy countenance. Being separated\n      from Paul, her sadness had an air of gentleness. But the moment he made a\n      gesture to recover her she turned away fiercely and gloomily, girt with\n      her fault as if with a golden girdle.",
                "He did not give up, making himself humble, suppliant, lamentable.",
                "One day he went to Lapersonne and said to him with tears in his eyes:",
                "\"Will you speak to her?\"",
                "Lapersonne excused himself, thinking that his intervention would be\n      useless, but he gave some advice to his friend.",
                "\"Make her think that you don't care about her, that you love another, and\n      she will come back to you.\"",
                "Hippolyte, adopting this method, inserted in the newspapers that he was\n      always to be found in the company of Mademoiselle Guinaud of the Opera. He\n      came home late or did not come home at all, assumed in Eveline's presence\n      an appearance of inward joy impossible to restrain, took out of his\n      pocket, at dinner, a letter on scented paper which he pretended to read\n      with delight, and his lips seemed as in a dream to kiss invisible lips.\n      Nothing happened. Eveline did not even notice the change. Insensible to\n      all around her, she only came out of her lethargy to ask for some louis\n      from her husband, and if he did not give them she threw him a look of\n      contempt, ready to upbraid him with the shame which she poured upon him in\n      the sight of the whole world. Since she had loved she spent a great deal\n      on dress. She needed money, and she had only her husband to secure it for\n      her; she was so far faithful to him.",
                "He lost patience, became furious, and threatened her with his revolver. He\n      said one day before her to Madame Clarence:",
                "\"I congratulate you, Madame; you have brought up your daughter to be a\n      wanton hussy.\"",
                "\"Take me away, Mamma,\" exclaimed Eveline. \"I will get a divorce!\"",
                "He loved her more ardently than ever. In his jealous rage, suspecting her,\n      not without probability, of sending and receiving letters, he swore that\n      he would intercept them, re-established a censorship over the post, threw\n      private correspondence into confusion, delayed stock-exchange quotations,\n      prevented assignations, brought about bankruptcies, thwarted passions, and\n      caused suicides. The independent press gave utterance to the complaints of\n      the public and indignantly supported them. To justify these arbitrary\n      measures, the ministerial journals spoke darkly of plots and public\n      dangers, and promoted a belief in a monarchical conspiracy. The less\n      well-informed sheets gave more precise information, told of the seizure of\n      fifty thousand guns, and the landing of Prince Crucho. Feeling grew\n      throughout the country, and the republican organs called for the immediate\n      meeting of Parliament. Paul Visire returned to Paris, summoned his\n      colleagues, held an important Cabinet Council, and proclaimed through his\n      agencies that a plot had been actually formed against the national\n      representation, but that the Prime Minister held the threads of it in his\n      hand, and that a judicial inquiry was about to be opened.",
                "He immediately ordered the arrest of thirty Socialists, and whilst the\n      entire country was acclaiming him as its saviour, baffling the\n      watchfulness of his six hundred detectives, he secretly took Eveline to a\n      little house near the Northern railway station, where they remained until\n      night. After their departure, the maid of their hotel, as she was putting\n      their room in order, saw seven little crosses traced by a hairpin on the\n      wall at the head of the bed.",
                "That is all that Hippolyte Ceres obtained as a reward of his efforts."

                "IX. THE FINAL CONSEQUENCES",
                "Jealousy is a virtue of democracies which preserves them from tyrants.\n      Deputies began to envy the Prime Minister his golden key. For a year his\n      domination over the beauteous Madame Ceres had been known to the whole\n      universe. The provinces, whither news and fashions only arrive after a\n      complete revolution of the earth round the sun, were at last informed of\n      the illegitimate loves of the Cabinet. The provinces preserve an austere\n      morality; women are more virtuous there than they are in the capital.",
                "Various reasons have been alleged for this: Education, example, simplicity\n      of life. Professor Haddock asserts that this virtue of provincial ladies\n      is solely due to the fact that the heels of their shoes are low. \"A\n      woman,\" said he, in a learned article in the \"Anthropological Review\", \"a\n      woman attracts a civilized man in proportion as her feet make an angle\n      with the ground. If this angle is as much as thirty-five degrees, the\n      attraction becomes acute. For the position of the feet upon the ground\n      determines the whole carriage of the body, and it results that provincial\n      women, since they wear low heels, are not very attractive, and preserve\n      their virtue with ease.\" These conclusions were not generally accepted. It\n      was objected that under the influence of English and American fashions,\n      low heels had been introduced generally without producing the results\n      attributed to them by the learned Professor; moreover, it was said that\n      the difference he pretended to establish between the morals of the\n      metropolis and those of the provinces is perhaps illusory, and that if it\n      exists, it is apparently due to the fact that great cities offer more\n      advantages and facilities for love than small towns provide. However that\n      may be, the provinces began to murmur against the Prime Minister, and to\n      raise a scandal. This was not yet a danger, but there was a possibility\n      that it might become one.",
                "For the moment the peril was nowhere and yet everywhere. The majority\n      remained solid; but the leaders became stiff and exacting. Perhaps\n      Hippolyte Ceres would never have intentionally sacrificed his interests to\n      his vengeance. But thinking that he could henceforth, without compromising\n      his own fortune, secretly damage that of Paul Visire, he devoted himself\n      to the skilful and careful preparation of difficulties and perils for the\n      Head of the Government. Though far from equalling his rival in talent,\n      knowledge, and authority, he greatly surpassed him in his skill as a\n      lobbyist. The most acute parliamentarians attributed the recent\n      misfortunes of the majority to his refusal to vote. At committees, by a\n      calculated imprudence, he favoured motions which he knew the Prime\n      Minister could not accept. One day his intentional awkwardness provoked a\n      sudden and violent conflict between the Minister of the Interior, and his\n      departmental Treasurer. Then Ceres became frightened and went no further.\n      It would have been dangerous for him to overthrow the ministry too soon.\n      His ingenious hatred found an issue by circuitous paths. Paul Visire had a\n      poor cousin of easy morals who bore his name. Ceres, remembering this\n      lady, Celine Visire, brought her into prominence, arranged that she should\n      become intimate with several foreigners, and procured her engagements in\n      the music-halls. One summer night, on a stage in the Champs Elysees before\n      a tumultuous crowd, she performed risky dances to the sounds of wild music\n      which was audible in the gardens where the President of the Republic was\n      entertaining Royalty. The name of Visire, associated with these scandals,\n      covered the walls of the town, filled the newspapers, was repeated in the\n      cafes and at balls, and blazed forth in letters of fire upon the\n      boulevards.",
                "Nobody regarded the Prime Minister as responsible for the scandal of his\n      relatives, but a bad idea of his family came into existence, and the\n      influence of the statesman was diminished.",
                "Almost immediately he was made to feel this in a pretty sharp fashion. One\n      day in the House, on a simple question, Labillette, the Minister of\n      Religion and Public Worship, who was suffering from an attack of liver,\n      and beginning to be exasperated by the intentions and intrigues of the\n      clergy, threatened to close the Chapel of St. Orberosia, and spoke without\n      respect of the National Virgin. The entire Right rose up in indignation;\n      the Left appeared to give but a half-hearted support to the rash Minister.\n      The leaders of the majority did not care to attack a popular cult which\n      brought thirty millions a year into the country. The most moderate of the\n      supporters of the Right, M. Bigourd, made the question the subject of a\n      resolution and endangered the Cabinet. Luckily, Fortune Lapersonne, the\n      Minister of Public Works, always conscious of the obligations of power,\n      was able in the Prime Minister's absence to repair the awkwardness and\n      indecorum of his colleague, the Minister of Public Worship. He ascended\n      the tribune and bore witness to the respect in which the Government held\n      the heavenly Patron of the country, the consoler of so many ills which\n      science admitted its powerlessness to relieve.",
                "When Paul Visire, snatched at last from Eveline's arms, appeared in the\n      House, the administration was saved; but the Prime Minister saw himself\n      compelled to grant important concessions to the upper classes. He proposed\n      in Parliament that six armoured cruisers should be laid down, and thus won\n      the sympathies of the Steel Trust; he gave new assurances that the income\n      tax would not be imposed, and he had eighteen Socialists arrested.",
                "He was soon to find himself opposed by more formidable obstacles. The\n      Chancellor of the neighbouring Empire in an ingenious and profound speech\n      upon the foreign relations of his sovereign, made a sly allusion to the\n      intrigues that inspired the policy of a great country. This reference,\n      which was receive with smiles by the Imperial Parliament, was certain to\n      irritate a punctilious republic. It aroused the national susceptibility,\n      which directed its wrath against its amorous Minister. The Deputies seized\n      upon a frivolous pretext to show their dissatisfaction. A ridiculous\n      incident, the fact that the wife of a subprefect had danced at the Moulin\n      Rouge, forced the minister to face a vote of censure, and he was within a\n      few votes of being defeated. According to general opinion, Paul Visire had\n      never been so weak, so vacillating, or so spiritless, as on that occasion.",
                "He understood that he could only keep himself in office by a great\n      political stroke, and he decided on the expedition to Nigritia. This\n      measure was demanded by the great financial and industrial corporations\n      and was one which would bring concessions of immense forests to the\n      capitalists, a loan of eight millions to the banking companies, as well as\n      promotions and decorations to the naval and military officers. A pretext\n      presented itself; some insult needed to be avenged, or some debt to be\n      collected. Six battleships, fourteen cruisers, and eighteen transports\n      sailed up the mouth of the river Hippopotamus. Six hundred canoes vainly\n      opposed the landing of the troops. Admiral Vivier des Murenes' cannons\n      produced an appalling effect upon the blacks, who replied to them with\n      flights of arrows, but in spite of their fanatical courage they were\n      entirely defeated. Popular enthusiasm was kindled by the newspapers which\n      the financiers subsidised, and burst into a blaze. Some Socialists alone\n      protested against this barbarous, doubtful, and dangerous enterprise. They\n      were at once arrested.",
                "At that moment when the Minister, supported by wealth, and now beloved by\n      the poor, seemed unconquerable, the light of hate showed Hippolyte Ceres\n      alone the danger, and looking with a gloomy joy at his rival, he muttered\n      between his teeth, \"He is wrecked, the brigand!\"",
                "Whilst the country intoxicated itself with glory, the neighbouring Empire\n      protested against the occupation of Nigritia by a European power, and\n      these protests following one another at shorter and shorter intervals\n      became more and more vehement. The newspapers of the interested Republic\n      concealed all causes for uneasiness; but Hippolyte Ceres heard the growing\n      menace, and determined at last to risk everything, even the fate of the\n      ministry, in order to ruin his enemy. He got men whom he could trust to\n      write and insert articles in several of the official journals, which,\n      seeming to express Paul Visire's precise views, attributed warlike\n      intentions to the Head of the Government.",
                "These articles roused a terrible echo abroad, and they alarmed the public\n      opinion of a nation which, while fond of soldiers, was not fond of war.\n      Questioned in the House on the foreign policy of his government, Paul\n      Visire made a re-assuring statement, and promised to maintain a face\n      compatible with the dignity of a great nation. His Minister of Foreign\n      Affairs, Crombile, read a declaration which was absolutely unintelligible,\n      for the reason that it was couched in diplomatic language. The Minister\n      obtained a large majority.",
                "But the rumours of war did not cease, and in order to avoid a new and\n      dangerous motion, the Prime Minister distributed eighty thousand acres of\n      forests in Nigritia among the Deputies, and had fourteen Socialists\n      arrested. Hippolyte Ceres went gloomily about the lobbies, confiding to\n      the Deputies of his group that he was endeavouring to induce the Cabinet\n      to adopt a pacific policy, and that he still hoped to succeed. Day by day\n      the sinister rumours grew in volume, and penetrating amongst the public,\n      spread uneasiness and disquiet. Paul Visire himself began to take alarm.\n      What disturbed him most were the silence and absence of the Minister of\n      Foreign Affairs. Crombile no longer came to the meetings of the Cabinet.\n      Rising at five o'clock in the morning, he worked eighteen hours at his\n      desk, and at last fell exhausted into his waste-paper basket, from whence\n      the registrars removed him, together with the papers which they were going\n      to sell to the military attaches of the neighbouring Empire.",
                "General Debonnaire believed that a campaign was imminent, and prepared for\n      it. Far from fearing war, he prayed for it, and confided his generous\n      hopes to Baroness Bildermann, who informed the neighbouring nation, which,\n      acting on her information, proceeded to a rapid mobilization.",
                "The Minister of Finance unintentionally precipitated events. At the\n      moment, he was speculating for a fall, and in order to bring about a panic\n      on the Stock Exchange, he spread the rumour that war was now inevitable.\n      The neighbouring Empire, deceived by this action, and expecting to see its\n      territory invaded, mobilized its troops in all haste. The terrified\n      Chamber overthrew the Visire ministry by an enormous majority (814 votes\n      to 7, with 28 abstentions). It was too late. The very day of this fall the\n      neighbouring and hostile nation recalled its ambassador and flung eight\n      millions of men into Madame Ceres' country. War became universal, and the\n      whole world was drowned in a torrent of blood.",
                "THE ZENITH OF PENGUIN CIVILIZATION",
                "Half a century after the events we have just related, Madame Ceres died\n      surrounded with respect and veneration, in the eighty-ninth year of her\n      age. She had long been the widow of a statesman whose name she bore with\n      dignity. Her modest and quiet funeral was followed by the orphans of the\n      parish and the sisters of the Sacred Compassion.",
                "The deceased left all her property to the Charity of St. Orberosia.",
                "\"Alas!\" sighed M. Monnoyer, a canon of St. Mael, as he received the pious\n      legacy, \"it was high time for a generous benefactor to come to the relief\n      of our necessities. Rich and poor, learned and ignorant are turning away\n      from us. And when we try to lead back these misguided souls, neither\n      threats nor promises, neither gentleness nor violence, nor anything else\n      is now successful. The Penguin clergy pine in desolation; our country\n      priests, reduced to following the humblest of trades, are shoeless, and\n      compelled to live upon such scraps as they can pick up. In our ruined\n      churches the rain of heaven falls upon the faithful, and during the holy\n      offices they can hear the noise of stones falling from the arches. The\n      tower of the cathedral is tottering and will soon fall. St. Orberosia is\n      forgotten by the Penguins, her devotion abandoned, and her sanctuary\n      deserted. On her shrine, bereft of its gold and precious stones, the\n      spider silently weaves her web.\"",
                "Hearing these lamentations, Pierre Mille, who at the age of ninety-eight\n      years had lost nothing of his intellectual and moral power, asked, the\n      canon if he did not think that St. Orberosia would one day rise out of\n      this wrongful oblivion.",
                "\"I hardly dare to hope so,\" sighed M. Monnoyer.",
                "\"It is a pity!\" answered Pierre Mille. \"Orberosia is a charming figure and\n      her legend is a beautiful one. I discovered the other day by the merest\n      chance, one of her most delightful miracles, the miracle of Jean Violle.\n      Would you like to hear it, M. Monnoyer?\"",
                "\"I should be very pleased, M. Mille.\"",
                "\"Here it is, then, just as I found it in a fifteenth-century manuscript",
                "\"Cecile, the wife of Nicolas Gaubert, a jeweller on the Pont-au-Change,\n      after having led an honest and chaste life for many years, and being now\n      past her prime, became infatuated with Jean Violle, the Countess de\n      Maubec's page, who lived at the Hotel du Paon on the Place de Greve. He\n      was not yet eighteen years old, and his face and figure were attractive.\n      Not being able to conquer her passion, Cecile resolved to satisfy it. She\n      attracted the page to her house, loaded him with caresses, supplied him\n      with sweetmeats and finally did as she wished with him.",
                "\"Now one day, as they were together in the jeweller's bed, Master Nicholas\n      came home sooner than he was expected. He found the bolt drawn, and heard\n      his wife on the other side of the door exclaiming, 'My heart! my angel! my\n      love!' Then suspecting that she was shut up with a gallant, he struck\n      great blows upon the door and began to shout 'Slut! hussy! wanton! open so\n      that I may cut off your nose and ears!' In this peril, the jeweller's wife\n      besought St. Orberosia, and vowed her a large candle if she helped her and\n      the little page, who was dying of fear beside the bed, out of their\n      difficulty.",
                "\"The saint heard the prayer. She immediately changed Jean Violle into a\n      girl. Seeing this, Cecile was completely reassured, and began to call out\n      to her husband: 'Oh! you brutal villain, you jealous wretch! Speak gently\n      if you want the door to be opened.' And scolding in this way, she ran to\n      the wardrobe and took out of it an old hood, a pair of stays, and a long\n      grey petticoat, in which she hastily wrapped the transformed page. Then\n      when this was done, 'Catherine, dear Catherine,' said she, loudly, 'open\n      the door for your uncle; he is more fool than knave, and won't do you any\n      harm.' The boy who had become a girl, obeyed. Master Nicholas entered the\n      room and found in it a young maid whom he did not know, and his wife in\n      bed. 'Big booby,' said the latter to him, 'don't stand gaping at what you\n      see, just as I had come to bed because had a stomach ache, I received a\n      visit from Catherine, the daughter of my sister Jeanne de Palaiseau, with\n      whom we quarrelled fifteen years ago. Kiss your niece. She is well worth\n      the trouble.' The jeweller gave Violle a hug, and from that moment wanted\n      nothing so much as to be alone with her a moment, so that he might embrace\n      her as much as he liked. For this reason he led her without any delay down\n      to the kitchen, under the pretext of giving her some walnuts and wine, and\n      he was no sooner there with her than he began to caress her very\n      affectionately. He would not have stopped at that if St. Orberosia had not\n      inspired his good wife with the idea of seeing what he was about. She\n      found him with the pretended niece sitting on his knee. She called him a\n      debauched creature, boxed his ears, and forced him to beg her pardon. The\n      next day Violle resumed his previous form.\"",
                "Having heard this story the venerable Canon Monnoyer thanked Pierre Mille\n      for having told it, and, taking up his pen, began to write out a list of\n      horses that would win at the next race meeting. For he was a book-maker's\n      clerk.",
                "In the mean time Penguinia gloried in its wealth. Those who produced the\n      things necessary for life, wanted them; those who did not produce them had\n      more than enough. \"But these,\" as a member of the Institute said, \"are\n      necessary economic fatalities.\" The great Penguin people had no longer\n      either traditions, intellectual culture, or arts. The progress of\n      civilisation manifested itself among them by murderous industry, infamous\n      speculation, and hideous luxury. Its capital assumed, as did all the great\n      cities of the time, a cosmopolitan and financial character. An immense and\n      regular ugliness reigned within it. The country enjoyed perfect\n      tranquillity. It had reached its zenith."

                "The houses were never high enough to satisfy them; they kept on making\n      them still higher and built them of thirty or forty storeys: with offices,\n      shops, banks, societies one above another; they dug cellars and tunnels\n      ever deeper downwards.",
                "Fifteen millions of men laboured in a giant town by the light of beacons\n      which shed forth their glare both day and night. No light of heaven\n      pierced through the smoke of the factories with which the town was girt,\n      but sometimes the red disk of a rayless sun might be seen riding in the\n      black firmament through which iron bridges ploughed their way, and from\n      which there descended a continual shower of soot and cinders. It was the\n      most industrial of all the cities in the world and the richest. Its\n      organisation seemed perfect. None of the ancient aristocratic or\n      democratic forms remained; everything was subordinated to the interests of\n      the trusts. This environment gave rise to what anthropologists called the\n      multi-millionaire type. The men of this type were at once energetic and\n      frail, capable of great activity in forming mental combinations and of\n      prolonged labour in offices, but men whose nervous irritability suffered\n      from hereditary troubles which increased as time went on.",
                "Like all true aristocrats, like the patricians of republican Rome or the\n      squires of old England, these powerful men affected a great severity in\n      their habits and customs. They were the ascetics of wealth. At the\n      meetings of the trusts an observer would have noticed their smooth and\n      puffy faces, their lantern cheeks, their sunken eyes and wrinkled brows.\n      With bodies more withered, complexions yellower, lips drier, and eyes\n      filled with a more burning fanaticism than those of the old Spanish monks,\n      these multimillionaires gave themselves up with inextinguishable ardour to\n      the austerities of banking and industry. Several, denying themselves all\n      happiness, all pleasure, and all rest, spent their miserable lives in\n      rooms without light or air, furnished only with electrical apparatus,\n      living on eggs and milk, and sleeping on camp beds. By doing nothing\n      except pressing nickel buttons with their fingers, these mystics heaped up\n      riches of which they never even saw the signs, and acquired the vain\n      possibility of gratifying desires that they never experienced.",
                "The worship of wealth had its martyrs. One of these multi-millionaires,\n      the famous Samuel Box, preferred to die rather than surrender the smallest\n      atom of his property. One of his workmen, the victim of an accident while\n      at work, being refused any indemnity by his employer, obtained a verdict\n      in the courts, but repelled by innumerable obstacles of procedure, he fell\n      into the direst poverty. Being thus reduced to despair, he succeeded by\n      dint of cunning and audacity in confronting his employer with a loaded\n      revolver in his hand, and threatened to blow out his brains if he did not\n      give him some assistance. Samuel Box gave nothing, and let himself be\n      killed for the sake of principle.",
                "Examples that come from high quarters are followed. Those who possessed\n      some small capital (and they were necessarily the greater number),\n      affected the ideas and habits of the multi-millionaires, in order that\n      they might be classed among them. All passions which injured the increase\n      or the preservation of wealth, were regarded as dishonourable; neither\n      indolence, nor idleness, nor the taste for disinterested study, nor love\n      of the arts, nor, above all, extravagance, was ever forgiven; pity was\n      condemned as a dangerous weakness. Whilst every inclination to\n      licentiousness excited public reprobation, the violent and brutal\n      satisfaction of an appetite was, on the contrary, excused; violence, in\n      truth, was regarded as less injurious to morality, since it manifested a\n      form of social energy. The State was firmly based on two great public\n      virtues: respect for the rich and contempt for the poor. Feeble spirits\n      who were still moved by human suffering had no other resource than to take\n      refuge in a hypocrisy which it was impossible to blame, since it\n      contributed to the maintenance of order and the solidity of institutions.",
                "Thus, among the rich, all were devoted to their social order, or seemed to\n      be so; all gave good examples, if all did not follow them. Some felt the\n      gravity of their position cruelly; but they endured it either from pride\n      or from duty. Some attempted, in secret and by subterfuge, to escape from\n      it for a moment. One of these, Edward Martin, the President, of the Steel\n      Trust, sometimes dressed himself as a poor man, went: forth to beg his\n      bread, and allowed himself to be jostled by the passers-by. One day, as he\n      asked alms on a bridge, he engaged in a quarrel with a real beggar, and\n      filled with a fury of envy, he strangled him.",
                "As they devoted their whole intelligence to business, they sought no\n      intellectual pleasures. The theatre, which had formerly been very\n      flourishing among them, was now reduced to pantomimes and comic dances.\n      Even the pieces in which women acted were given up; the taste for pretty\n      forms and brilliant toilettes had been lost; the somersaults of clowns and\n      the music of negroes were preferred above them, and what roused enthusiasm\n      was the sight of women upon the stage whose necks were bedizened with\n      diamonds, or processions carrying golden bars in triumph. Ladies of wealth\n      were as much compelled as the men to lead a respectable life. According to\n      a tendency common to all civilizations, public feeling set them up as\n      symbols; they were, by their austere magnificence, to represent both the\n      splendour of wealth and its intangible. The old habits of gallantry had\n      been reformed, Tut fashionable lovers were now secretly replaced by\n      muscular labourers or stray grooms. Nevertheless, scandals were rare, a\n      foreign journey concealed nearly all of them, and the Princesses of the\n      Trusts remained objects of universal esteem.",
                "The rich formed only a small minority, but their collaborators, who\n      composed the entire people, had been completely won over or completely\n      subjugated by them. They formed two classes, the agents of commerce or\n      banking, and workers in the factories. The former contributed an immense\n      amount of work and received large salaries. Some of them succeeded in\n      founding establishments of their own; for in the constant increase of the\n      public wealth the more intelligent and audacious could hope for anything.\n      Doubtless it would have been possible to find a certain number of\n      discontented and rebellious persons among the immense crowd of engineers\n      and accountants, but this powerful society had imprinted its firm\n      discipline even on the minds of its opponents. The very anarchists were\n      laborious and regular.",
                "As for the workmen who toiled in the factories that surrounded the town,\n      their decadence, both physical and moral, was terrible; they were examples\n      of the type of poverty as it is set forth by anthropology. Although the\n      development among them of certain muscles, due to the particular nature of\n      their work, might give a false idea of their strength, they presented sure\n      signs of morbid debility. Of low stature, with small heads and narrow\n      chests, they were further distinguished from the comfortable classes by a\n      multitude of physiological anomalies, and, in particular, by a common want\n      of symmetry between the head and the limbs. And they were destined to a\n      gradual and continuous degeneration, for the State made soldiers of the\n      more robust among them, and the health of these did not long withstand the\n      brothels and the drink-shops that sprang up around their barracks. The\n      proletarians became more and more feeble in mind. The continued weakening\n      of their intellectual faculties was not entirely due to their manner of\n      life; it resulted also from a methodical selection carried out by the\n      employers. The latter, fearing that workmen of too great ability might be\n      inclined to put forward legitimate demands, took care to eliminate them by\n      every possible means, and preferred to engage ignorant and stupid\n      labourers, who were incapable of defending their rights, but were yet\n      intelligent enough to perform their toil, which highly perfected machines\n      rendered extremely simple. Thus the proletarians were unable to do\n      anything to improve their lot. With difficulty did they succeed by means\n      of strikes in maintaining the rate of their wages. Even this means began\n      to fail them. The alternations of production inherent in the capitalist\n      system caused such cessations of work that, in several branches of\n      industry, as soon as a strike was declared, the accumulation of products\n      allowed the employers to dispense with the strikers. In a word, these\n      miserable employees were plunged in a gloomy apathy that nothing\n      enlightened and nothing exasperated. They were necessary instruments for\n      the social order and well adapted to their purpose.",
                "Upon the whole, this social order seemed the most firmly established that\n      had yet been seen, at least amon kind, for that of bees and ants is\n      incomparably more stable. Nothing could foreshadow the ruin of a system\n      founded on what is strongest in human nature, pride and cupidity. However,\n      keen observers discovered several grounds for uneasiness. The most\n      certain, although the least apparent, were of an economic order, and\n      consisted in the continually increasing amount of over-production, which\n      entailed long and cruel interruptions of labour, though these were, it is\n      true, utilized by the manufacturers as a means of breaking the power of\n      the workmen, by facing them with the prospect of a lock-out. A more\n      obvious peril resulted from the physiological state of almost the entire\n      population. \"The health of the poor is what it must be,\" said the experts\n      in hygiene, \"but that of the rich leaves much to be desired.\" It was not\n      difficult to find the causes of this. The supply of oxygen necessary for\n      life was insufficient in the city, and men breathed in an artificial air.\n      The food trusts, by means of the most daring chemical syntheses, produced\n      artificial wines, meat, milk, fruit, and vegetables, and the diet thus\n      imposed gave rise to stomach and brain troubles. The multi-millionaires\n      were bald at the age of eighteen; some showed from time to time a\n      dangerous weakness of mind. Over-strung and enfeebled, they gave enormous\n      sums to ignorant charlatans; and it was a common thing for some\n      bath-attendant or other trumpery who turned healer or prophet, to make a\n      rapid fortune by the practice of medicine or theology. The number of\n      lunatics increased continually; suicides multiplied in the world of\n      wealth, and many of them were accompanied by atrocious and extraordinary\n      circumstances, which bore witness to an unheard o perversion of\n      intelligence and sensibility.",
                "Another fatal symptom created a strong impression upon average minds.\n      Terrible accidents, henceforth periodical and regular, entered into\n      people's calculations, and kept mounting higher and higher in statistical\n      tables. Every day, machines burst into fragments, houses fell down, trains\n      laden with merchandise fell on to the streets, demolishing entire\n      buildings and crushing hundreds of passers-by. Through the ground,\n      honey-combed with tunnels, two or three storeys of work-shops would often\n      crash, engulfing all those who worked in them.",
                "S. 2",
                "In the southwestern district of the city, on an eminence which had\n      preserved its ancient name of Fort Saint-Michel, there stretched a square\n      where some old trees still spread their exhausted arms above the\n      greensward. Landscape gardeners had constructed a cascade, grottos, a\n      torrent, a lake, and an island, on its northern slope. From this side one\n      could see the whole town with its streets, its boulevards, its squares,\n      the multitude of its roofs and domes, its air-passages, and its crowds of\n      men, covered with a veil of silence, and seemingly enchanted by the\n      distance. This square was the healthiest place in the capital; here no\n      smoke obscured the sky, and children were brought here to play. In summer\n      some employees from the neighbouring offices and laboratories used to\n      resort to it for a moment after their luncheons, but they did not disturb\n      its solitude and peace.",
                "It was owing to this custom that, one day in June, about mid-day, a\n      telegraph clerk, Caroline Meslier, came and sat down on a bench at the end\n      of a terrace. In order to refresh her eyes by the sight of a little green,\n      she turned her back to the town. Dark, with brown eyes, robust and placid,\n      Caroline appeared to be from twenty-five to twenty-eight years of age.\n      Almost immediately, a clerk in the Electricity Trust, George Clair, took\n      his place beside her. Fair, thin, and supple, he had features of a\n      feminine delicacy; he was scarcely older than she, and looked still\n      younger. As they met almost every day in this place, a comradeship had\n      sprung up between them, and they enjoyed chatting together. But their\n      conversation had never been tender, affectionate, or even intimate.\n      Caroline, although it had happened to her in the past to repent of her\n      confidence, might perhaps have been less reserved had not George Clair\n      always shown himself extremely restrained in his expressions and\n      behaviour. He always gave a purely intellectual character to the\n      conversation, keeping it within the realm of general ideas, and, moreover,\n      expressing himself on all subjects with the greatest freedom. He spoke\n      frequently of the organization of society, and the conditions of labour.",
                "\"Wealth,\" said he, \"is one of the means of living happily; but people have\n      made it the sole end of existence.\"",
                "And this state of things seemed monstrous to both of them.",
                "They returned continually to various scientific subjects with which they\n      were both familiar.",
                "On that day they discussed the evolution of chemistry.",
                "\"From the moment,\" said Clair, \"that radium was seen to be transformed\n      into helium, people ceased to affirm the immutability of simple bodies; in\n      this way all those old laws about simple relations and about the\n      indestructibility of matter were abolished.\"",
                "\"However,\" said she, \"chemical laws exist.\"",
                "For, being a woman, she had need of belief.",
                "He resumed carelessly:",
                "\"Now that we can procure radium in sufficient quantities, science\n      possesses incomparable means of analysis; even at present we get glimpses,\n      within what are called simple bodies, of extremely diversified complex\n      ones, and we discover energies in matter which seem to increase even by\n      reason of its tenuity.\"",
                "As they talked, they threw bits of bread to the birds, and some children\n      played around them.",
                "Passing from one subject to another:",
                "\"This hill, in the quaternary epoch,\" said Clair, \"was inhabited by wild\n      horses. Last year, as they were tunnelling for the water mains, they found\n      a layer of the bones of primeval horses.\"",
                "She was anxious to know whether, at that distant epoch, man had yet\n      appeared.",
                "He told her that man used to hunt the primeval horse long before he tried\n      to domesticate him.",
                "\"Man,\" he added, \"was at first a hunter, then he became a shepherd, a\n      cultivator, a manufacturer . . . and these diverse civilizations succeeded\n      each other at intervals of time that the mind cannot conceive.\"",
                "He took out his watch.",
                "Caroline asked if it was already time to go back to the office.",
                "He said it was not, that it was scarcely half-past twelve.",
                "A little girl was making mud pies at the foot of their bench; a little boy\n      of seven or eight years was playing in front of them. Whilst his mother\n      was sewing on an adjoining bench, he played all alone at being a run-away\n      horse, and with that power of illusion, of which children are capable, he\n      imagined that he was at the same time the horse, and those who ran after\n      him, and those who fled in terror before him. He kept struggling with\n      himself and shouting: \"Stop him, Hi! Hi! This is an awful horse, he has\n      got the bit between his teeth.\"",
                "Caroline asked the question:",
                "\"Do you think that men were happy formerly?\"",
                "Her companion answered:",
                "\"They suffered less when they were younger. They acted like that little\n      boy: they played; they played at arts, at virtues, at vices, at heroism,\n      at beliefs, at pleasures; they had illusions which entertained them; they\n      made a noise; they amused themselves. But now. . . .\"",
                "He interrupted himself, and looked again at his watch.",
                "The child, who was running, struck his foot against the little girl's\n      pail, and fell his full length on the gravel. He remained a moment\n      stretched out motionless, then raised himself up on the palms of his\n      hands. His forehead puckered, his mouth opened, and he burst into tears.\n      His mother ran up, but Caroline had lifted him from the ground and was\n      wiping his eyes and mouth with her handkerchief.",
                "The child kept on sobbing and Clair took him in his arms.",
                "\"Come, don't cry, my little man! I am going to tell you a story.",
                "\"A fisherman once threw his net into the sea and drew out a little,\n      sealed, copper pot, which he opened with his knife. Smoke came out of it,\n      and as it mounted up to the clouds the smoke grew thicker and thicker and\n      became a giant who gave such a terrible yawn that the whole world was\n      blown to dust.\"",
                "Clair stopped himself, gave a dry laugh, and handed the child back to his\n      mother. Then he took out his watch again, and kneeling on the bench with\n      his elbows resting on its back he gazed at the town. As far as the eye\n      could reach, the multitude of houses stood out in their tiny immensity.",
                "Caroline turned her eyes in the same direction.",
                "\"What splendid weather it is!\" said she. \"The sun's rays change the smoke\n      on the horizon into gold. The worst thing about civilization is that it\n      deprives one of the light of day.\"",
                "We did not answer; his looks remained fixed on a place in the town.",
                "After some seconds of silence they saw about half a mile away, in the\n      richer district on the other side of the river, a sort of tragic fog\n      rearing itself upwards. A moment afterwards an explosion was heard even\n      where they were sitting, and an immense tree of smoke mounted towards the\n      pure sky. Little by little the air was filled with an imperceptible murmur\n      caused by the shouts of thousands of men. Cries burst forth quite close to\n      the square.",
                "\"What has been blown up?\"",
                "The bewilderment was great, for although accidents were common, such a\n      violent explosion as this one had never been seen, and everybody perceived\n      that something terribly strange had happened.",
                "Attempts were made to locate the place of the accident; districts,\n      streets, different buildings, clubs, theatres, and shops were mentioned.\n      Information gradually became more precise and at last the truth was known.",
                "\"The Steel Trust has just been blown up.\"",
                "Clair put his watch back into his pocket.",
                "Caroline looked at him closely and her eyes filled with astonishment.",
                "At last she whispered in his ear:",
                "\"Did you know it? Were you expecting it? Was it you . . . ?\"",
                "He answered very calmly:",
                "\"That town ought to be destroyed.\"",
                "She replied in a gentle and thoughtful tone:",
                "\"I think so too.\"",
                "And both of them returned quietly to their work.",
                "S. 3",
                "From that day onward, anarchist attempts followed one another every week\n      without interruption. The victims were numerous, and almost all of them\n      belonged to the poorer classes. These crimes roused public resentment. It\n      was among domestic servants, hotel-keepers, and the employees of such\n      small shops as the Trusts still allowed to exist, that indignation burst\n      forth most vehemently. In popular districts women might be heard demanding\n      unusual punishments for the dynamitards. (They were called by this old\n      name, although it was hardly appropriate to them, since, to these unknown\n      chemists, dynamite was an innocent material only fit to destroy ant-hills,\n      and they considered it mere child's play to explode nitro-glycerine with a\n      cartridge made of fulminate of mercury.) Business ceased suddenly, and\n      those who were least rich were the first to feel the effects. They spoke\n      of doing justice themselves to the anarchists. In the mean time the\n      factory workers remained hostile or indifferent to violent action. They\n      were threatened, as a result of the decline of business, with a likelihood\n      of losing their work, or even a lock-out in all the factories. The\n      Federation of Trade Unions proposed a general strike as the most powerful\n      means of influencing the employers, and the best aid that could be given\n      to the revolutionists, but all the trades with the exception of the\n      gliders refused to cease work.",
                "The police made numerous arrests. Troops summoned from all parts of the\n      National Federation protected the offices of the Trusts, the houses of the\n      multi-millionaires, the public halls, the banks, and the big shops. A\n      fortnight passed without a single explosion, and it was concluded that the\n      dynamitards, in all probability but a handful of persons, perhaps even\n      Still fewer, had all been killed or captured, or that they were in hiding,\n      or had taken flight. Confidence returned; it returned at first among the\n      poorer classes. Two or three hundred thousand soldiers, who bad been\n      lodged in the most closely populated districts, stimulated trade, and\n      people began to cry out: \"Hurrah for the army!\"",
                "The rich, who had not been so quick to take alarm, were reassured more\n      slowly. But at the Stock Exchange a group of \"bulls\" spread optimistic\n      rumours and by a powerful effort put a brake upon the fall in prices.\n      Business improved. Newspapers with big circulations supported the\n      movement. With patriotic eloquence they depicted capital as laughing in\n      its impregnable position at the assaults of a few dastardly criminals, and\n      public wealth maintaining its serene ascendency in spite of the vain\n      threats made against it. They were sincere in their attitude, though at\n      the same time they found it benefited them. Outrages were forgotten or\n      their occurrence denied. On Sundays, at the race-meetings, the stands were\n      adorned by women covered with pearls and diamonds. It was observed with\n      joy that the capitalists had not suffered. Cheers were given for the\n      multi-millionaires in the saddling rooms.",
                "On the following day the Southern Railway Station, the Petroleum Trust,\n      and the huge church built at the expense of Thomas Morcellet were all\n      blown up. Thirty houses were in flames, and the beginning of a fire was\n      discovered at the docks. The firemen showed amazing intrepidity and zeal.\n      They managed their tall fire-escapes with automatic precision, and climbed\n      as high as thirty storeys to rescue the luckless inhabitants from the\n      flames. The soldiers performed their duties with spirit, and were given a\n      double ration of coffee. But these fresh casualties started a panic.\n      Millions of people, who wanted to take their money with them and leave the\n      town at once, crowded the great banking houses. These establishments,\n      after paying out money for three days, closed their doors amid mutterings\n      of a riot. A crowd of fugitives, laden with their baggage, besieged the\n      railway stations and took the town by storm. Many who were anxious to lay\n      in a stock of provisions and take refuge in the cellars, attacked the\n      grocery stores, although they were guarded by soldiers with fixed\n      bayonets. The public authorities displayed energy. Numerous arrests were\n      made and thousands of warrants issued against suspected persons.",
                "During the three weeks that followed no outrage was committed. There was a\n      rumour that bombs had been found in the Opera House, in the cellars of the\n      Town Hall, and beside one of the Pillars of the Stock Exchange. But it was\n      soon known that these were boxes of sweets that had been put in those\n      places by practical jokers or lunatics. One of the accused, when\n      questioned by a magistrate, declared that he was the chief author of the\n      explosions, and said that all his accomplices had lost their lives. These\n      confessions were published by the newspapers and helped to reassure public\n      opinion. It was only towards the close of the examination that the\n      magistrates saw they had to deal with a pretender who was in no way\n      connected with any of the crimes.",
                "The experts chosen by the courts discovered nothing that enabled them to\n      determine the engine employed in the work of destruction. According to\n      their conjectures the new explosive emanated from a gas which radium\n      evolves, and it was supposed that electric waves, produced by a special\n      type of oscillator, were propagated through space and thus caused the\n      explosion. But even the ablest chemist could say nothing precise or\n      certain. At last two policemen, who were passing in front of the Hotel\n      Meyer, found on the pavement, close to a ventilator, an egg made of white\n      metal and provided with a capsule at each end. They picked it up\n      carefully, and, on the orders of their chief, carried it to the municipal\n      laboratory. Scarcely had the experts assembled to examine it, than the egg\n      burst and blew up the amphitheatre and the dome. All the experts perished,\n      and with them Collin, the General of Artillery, and the famous Professor\n      Tigre.",
                "The capitalist society did not allow itself to be daunted by this fresh\n      disaster. The great banks re-opened their doors, declaring that they would\n      meet demands partly in bullion and partly in paper money guaranteed by the\n      State: The Stock Exchange and the Trade Exchange, in spite of the complete\n      cessation of business, decided not to suspend their sittings.",
                "In the mean time the magisterial investigation into the case of those who\n      had been first accused had come to an end. Perhaps the evidence brought\n      against them might have appeared insufficient under other circumstances,\n      but the zeal both of the magistrates and the public made up for this\n      insufficiency. On the eve of the day fixed for the trial the Courts of\n      justice were blown up and eight hundred people were killed, the greater\n      number of them being judges and lawyers. A furious crowd broke into the\n      prison and lynched the prisoners. The troops sent to restore order were\n      received with showers of stones and revolver shots; several soldiers being\n      dragged from their horses and trampled underfoot. The soldiers fired on\n      the mob and many persons were killed. At last the public authorities\n      succeeded in establishing tranquillity. Next day the Bank was blown up.",
                "From that time onwards unheard-of things took place. The factory workers,\n      who had refused to strike, rushed in crowds into the town and set fire to\n      the houses. Entire regiments, led by their officers, joined the workmen,\n      went with them through the town singing revolutionary hymns, and took\n      barrels of petroleum from the docks with which to feed the fires.\n      Explosions were continual. One morning a monstrous tree of smoke, like the\n      ghost of a huge palm tree half a mile in height, rose above the giant\n      Telegraph Hall which suddenly fell into a complete ruin.",
                "Whilst half the town was in flames, the other half pursued its accustomed\n      life. In the mornings, milk pails could be heard jingling in the dairy\n      carts. In a deserted avenue some old navvy might be seen seated against a\n      wall slowly eating hunks of bread with perhaps a little meat. Almost all\n      the presidents of the trusts remained at their posts. Some of them\n      performed their duty with heroic simplicity. Raphael Box, the son of a\n      martyred multi-millionaire, was blown up as he was presiding at the\n      general meeting of the Sugar Trust. He was given a magnificent funeral and\n      the procession on its way to the cemetery had to climb six times over\n      piles of ruins or cross upon planks over the uprooted roads.",
                "The ordinary helpers of the rich, the clerks, employees, brokers, and\n      agents, preserved an unshaken fidelity. The surviving clerks of the Bank\n      that had been blown up, made their way along the ruined streets through\n      the midst of smoking houses to hand in their bills of exchange, and\n      several were swallowed up in the flames while endeavouring to present\n      their receipts.",
                "Nevertheless, any illusion concerning the state of affairs was impossible.\n      The enemy was master of the town. Instead of silence the noise of\n      explosions was now continuous and produced an insurmountable feeling of\n      horror. The lighting apparatus having been destroyed, the city was plunged\n      in darkness all through the night, and appalling crimes were committed.\n      The populous districts alone, having suffered the least, still preserved\n      measures of protection. The were paraded by patrols of volunteers who shot\n      the robbers, and at every street corner one stumbled over a body lying in\n      a pool of blood, the hands bound behind the back, a handkerchief over the\n      face, and a placard pinned upon the breast.",
                "It became impossible to clear away the ruins or to bury the dead. Soon the\n      stench from the corpses became intolerable. Epidemics raged and caused\n      innumerable deaths, while they also rendered the survivors feeble and\n      listless. Famine carried off almost all who were left. A hundred and one\n      days after the first outrage, whilst six army corps with field artillery\n      and siege artillery were marching, at night, into the poorest quarter of\n      the city, Caroline and Clair, holding each other's hands, were watching\n      from the roof a lofty house, the only one still left standing, but now\n      surrounded by smoke and flame, joyous songs ascended from the street,\n      where the crowd was dancing in delirium.",
                "\"To-morrow it will be ended,\" said the man, \"and it will be better.\"",
                "The young woman, her hair loosened and her face shining with the\n      reflection of the flames, gazed with a pious joy at the circle of fire\n      that was growing closer around them.",
                "\"It will be better,\" said she also.",
                "And throwing herself into the destroyer's arms she pressed a passionate\n      kiss upon his lips.",
                "S. 4",
                "The other towns of the federation also suffered from disturbances and\n      outbreaks, and then order was restored. Reforms were introduced into\n      institutions and great changes took place in habits and customs, but the\n      country never recovered the loss of its capital, and never regained its\n      former prosperity. Commerce and industry dwindled away, and civilization\n      abandoned those countries which for so long it bad preferred to all\n      others. They became insalubrious and sterile; the territory that had\n      supported so many millions of men became nothing more than a desert. On\n      the hill of Fort St. Michel wild horses cropped the coarse grass.",
                "Days flowed by like water from the fountains, and the centuries passed\n      like drops falling from the ends of stalactites. Hunters came to chase the\n      bears upon the hills that covered the forgotten city; shepherds led their\n      flocks upon them; labourers turned up the soil with their ploughs;\n      gardeners cultivated their lettuces and grafted their pear trees. They\n      were not rich, and they had no arts. The walls of their cabins were\n      covered with old vines and roses, A goat-skin clothed their tanned limbs,\n      while their wives dressed themselves with the wool that they themselves\n      had spun. The goat-herds moulded little figures of men and animals out of\n      clay, or sang songs about the young girl who follows her lover through\n      woods or among the browsing goats while the pine trees whisper together\n      and the water utters its murmuring sound. The master of the house grew\n      angry with the beetles who devoured his figs; he planned snares to protect\n      his fowls from the velvet-tailed fox, and he poured out wine for his\n      neighbours saying:",
                "\"Drink! The flies have not spoilt my vintage; the vines were dry before\n      they came.\"",
                "Then in the course of ages the wealth of the villages and the corn that\n      filled the fields were pillaged by barbarian invaders. The country changed\n      its masters several times. The conquerors built castles upon the hills;\n      cultivation increased; mills, forges, tanneries, and looms were\n      established; roads were opened through the woods and over the marshes; the\n      river was covered with boats. The hamlets became large villages and\n      joining together formed a town which protected itself by deep trenches and\n      lofty walls. Later, becoming the capital of a great State, it found itself\n      straitened within its now useless ramparts and it converted them into\n      grass-covered walks.",
                "It grew very rich and large beyond measure. The houses were never high\n      enough to satisfy the people; they kept on making them still higher and\n      built them of thirty or forty storeys, with offices, shops, banks,\n      societies one above another; they dug cellars and tunnels ever deeper\n      downwards. Fifteen millions of men laboured in the giant town."
