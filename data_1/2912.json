                "ACT I",
                "The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat. There are two doors, one\n        open into the hall, the other shut and curtained. Through a large bay\n        window, the curtains of which are not yet drawn, the towers of\n        Westminster can be seen darkening in a summer sunset; a grand piano\n        stands across one corner. The man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and\n        discreet, is arranging two tables for Bridge. BURNEY, the maid, a girl\n        with one of those flowery Botticellian faces only met with in England,\n        comes in through the curtained door, which she leaves open, disclosing\n        the glimpse of a white wall. PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her\n        head, with an expression of concern.",
                "PAYNTER. Where's she gone?",
                "BURNEY. Just walks about, I fancy.",
                "PAYNTER. She and the Governor don't hit it! One of these days she'll flit -- you'll\n      see. I like her -- she's a lady; but these thoroughbred 'uns -- it's\n      their skin and their mouths. They'll go till they drop if they like the\n      job, and if they don't, it's nothing but jib -- jib -- jib. How was\n      it down there before she married him?",
                "BURNEY. Oh! Quiet, of course.",
                "PAYNTER. Country homes -- I know 'em. What's her father, the old\n      Rector, like?",
                "BURNEY. Oh! very steady old man. The mother dead long before I took the\n      place.",
                "PAYNTER. Not a penny, I suppose?",
                "BURNEY. [Shaking her head] No; and seven of them.",
                "PAYNTER. [At sound of the hall door] The Governor!",
                "BURNEY withdraws through the curtained door. GEORGE DEDMOND enters from\n        the hall. He is in evening dress, opera hat, and overcoat; his face is\n        broad, comely, glossily shaved, but with neat moustaches. His eyes,\n        clear, small, and blue-grey, have little speculation. His hair is well\n        brushed.",
                "GEORGE. [Handing PAYNTER his coat and hat] Look here, Paynter! When I send\n      up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a black waistcoat as\n      well.",
                "PAYNTER. I asked the mistress, sir.",
                "GEORGE. In future -- see?",
                "PAYNTER. Yes, sir. [Signing towards the window] Shall I leave the sunset,\n      sir?",
                "But GEORGE has crossed to the curtained door; he opens it and says:\n        \"Clare!\" Receiving no answer, he goes in. PAYNTER switches up the\n        electric light. His face, turned towards the curtained door, is\n        apprehensive.",
                "GEORGE. [Re-entering] Where's Mrs. Dedmond?",
                "PAYNTER. I hardly know, sir.",
                "GEORGE. Dined in?",
                "PAYNTER. She had a mere nothing at seven, sir.",
                "GEORGE. Has she gone out, since?",
                "PAYNTER. Yes, sir -- that is, yes. The -- er -- mistress was not\n      dressed at all. A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir.",
                "GEORGE. What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?",
                "PAYNTER. Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine; and\n      Captain Huntingdon, too -- Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton might be a bit late,\n      sir.",
                "GEORGE. It's that now. Your mistress said nothing?",
                "PAYNTER. Not to me, sir.",
                "GEORGE. Send Burney.",
                "PAYNTER. Very good, sir. [He withdraws.]",
                "GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables. BURNEY comes in front the\n        hall.",
                "GEORGE. Did your mistress say anything before she went out?",
                "BURNEY. Yes, sir.",
                "GEORGE. Well?",
                "BURNEY. I don't think she meant it, sir.",
                "GEORGE. I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact.",
                "BURNEY. Yes, sir. The mistress said: \"I hope it'll be a pleasant evening,\n      Burney!\"",
                "GEORGE. Oh! -- Thanks.",
                "BURNEY. I've put out the mistress's things, sir.",
                "GEORGE. Ah!",
                "BURNEY. Thank you, sir. [She withdraws.]",
                "GEORGE. Damn!",
                "He again goes to the curtained door, and passes through. PAYNTER, coming\n        in from the hall, announces: \"General Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond.\" SIR\n        CHARLES is an upright, well-groomed, grey-moustached, red-faced man of\n        sixty-seven, with a keen eye for molehills, and none at all for\n        mountains. LADY DEDMOND has a firm, thin face, full of capability and\n        decision, not without kindliness; and faintly weathered, as if she had\n        faced many situations in many parts of the world. She is fifty five.\n        PAYNTER withdraws.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Hullo! Where are they? H'm!",
                "As he speaks, GEORGE re-enters.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [Kissing her son] Well, George. Where's Clare?",
                "GEORGE. Afraid she's late.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Are we early?",
                "GEORGE. As a matter of fact, she's not in.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Oh?",
                "SIR CHARLES. H'm! Not -- not had a rumpus?",
                "GEORGE. Not particularly. [With the first real sign of feeling] What I\n      can't stand is being made a fool of before other people. Ordinary friction\n      one can put up with. But that --  --",
                "SIR CHARLES. Gone out on purpose? What!",
                "LADY DEDMOND. What was the trouble?",
                "GEORGE. I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge. Appears\n      she'd asked that fellow Malise, for music.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Without letting you know?",
                "GEORGE. I believe she did tell me.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. But surely --  --",
                "GEORGE. I don't want to discuss it. There's never anything in particular.\n      We're all anyhow, as you know.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I see. [She looks shrewdly at her son] My dear, I should be\n      rather careful about him, I think.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Who's that?",
                "LADY DEDMOND. That Mr. Malise.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Oh! That chap!",
                "GEORGE. Clare isn't that sort.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I know. But she catches up notions very easily. I think it's\n      a great pity you ever came across him.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Where did you pick him up?",
                "GEORGE. Italy -- this Spring -- some place or other where they\n      couldn't speak English.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Um! That's the worst of travellin'.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I think you ought to have dropped him. These literary people -- -[Quietly]\n      From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't very far, George.",
                "SIR CHARLES. We'll make him play Bridge. Do him good, if he's that sort of\n      fellow.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Is anyone else coming?",
                "GEORGE. Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [Softly] You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to speak\n      to you for a long time. It is such a pity you and Clare -- What is it?",
                "GEORGE. God knows! I try, and I believe she does.",
                "SIR CHARLES. It's distressin' -- for us, you know, my dear fellow -- \n      distressin'.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I know it's been going on for a long time.",
                "GEORGE. Oh! leave it alone, mother.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a point -- put\n      ideas into her head.",
                "GEORGE. You can't dislike him more than I do. But there's nothing one can\n      object to.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home? Brothers\n      sometimes --  --",
                "GEORGE. I can't bear my affairs being messed about --  --",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be supposed to\n      be out together, than for her to be out alone. Go quietly into the\n      dining-room and wait for her.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Good! Leave your mother to make up something. She'll do it!",
                "LADY DEDMOND. That may be he. Quick!",
                "[A bell sounds.] GEORGE goes out into the hall, leaving the door open in\n        his haste. LADY DEDMOND, following, calls \"Paynter!\" PAYNTER enters.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Don't say anything about your master and mistress being out.\n      I'll explain.",
                "PAYNTER. The master, my lady?",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Yes, I know. But you needn't say so. Do you understand?",
                "PAYNTER. [In polite dudgeon] Just so, my lady.",
                "[He goes out.]",
                "SIR CHARLES. By Jove! That fellow smells a rat!",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Be careful, Charles!",
                "SIR CHARLES. I should think so.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I shall simply say they're dining out, and that we're not to\n      wait Bridge for them.",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Listening] He's having a palaver with that man of George's.",
                "PAYNTER, reappearing, announces: \"Captain Huntingdon.\" SIR CHARLES and\n        LADY DEDMOND turn to him with relief.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Ah! It's you, Reginald!",
                "HUNTINGDON. [A tall, fair soldier, of thirty] How d'you do? How are you,\n      sir? What's the matter with their man?",
                "SHE CHARLES. What!",
                "HUNTINGDON. I was going into the dining-room to get rid of my cigar; and\n      he said: \"Not in there, sir. The master's there, but my instructions are\n      to the effect that he's not.\"",
                "SHE CHARLES. I knew that fellow --  --",
                "LADY DEDMOND. The fact is, Reginald, Clare's out, and George is waiting\n      for her. It's so important people shouldn't --  --",
                "HUNTINGDON. Rather!",
                "They draw together, as people do, discussing the misfortunes of members\n        of their families.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. It's getting serious, Reginald. I don't know what's to\n      become of them. You don't think the Rector -- you don't think your\n      father would speak to Clare?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough. He takes anything of\n      that sort to heart so -- especially Clare.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Can't you put in a word yourself?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Don't know where the mischief lies.",
                "SIR CHARLES. I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road. Very\n      steady-goin' fellow, old George.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Oh, yes; George is all right, sir.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. They ought to have had children.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't. I really don't\n      know what to say, ma'am.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often noticed\n      parsons' daughters grow up queer. Get too much morality and rice puddin'.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [With a clear look] Charles!",
                "SIR CHARLES. What was she like when you were kids?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Oh, all right. Could be rather a little devil, of course, when\n      her monkey was up.",
                "SIR CHARLES. I'm fond of her. Nothing she wants that she hasn't got, is\n      there?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Never heard her say so.",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Dimly] I don't know whether old George is a bit too matter\n      of fact for her. H'm?",
                "[A short silence.]",
                "LADY DEDMOND. There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night. I forget if you\n      know him.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Yes. Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. He's literary. [With hesitation] You -- you don't think\n      he -- puts -- er -- ideas into her head?",
                "HUNTINGDON. I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a bit of\n      an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows. Can't see Clare --  --",
                "LADY DEDMOND. No. Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be\n      encouraged. Listen! -- It is her-coming in. I can hear their voices.\n      Gone to her room. What a blessing that man isn't here yet! [The door bell\n      rings] Tt! There he is, I expect.",
                "SIR CHARLES. What are we goin' to say?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for them.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Good!",
                "The door is opened, and PAYNTER announces \"Mr. Kenneth Malise.\" MALISE\n        enters. He is a tall man, about thirty-five, with a strongly marked,\n        dark, irregular, ironic face, and eyes which seem to have needles in\n        their pupils. His thick hair is rather untidy, and his dress clothes not\n        too new.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. How do you do? My son and daughter-in-law are so very sorry.\n      They'll be here directly.",
                "[MALISE bows with a queer, curly smile.]",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Shaking hands] How d'you do, sir?",
                "HUNTINGDON. We've met, I think.",
                "He gives MALISE that peculiar smiling stare, which seems to warn the\n        person bowed to of the sort of person he is. MALISE'S eyes sparkle.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Clare will be so grieved. One of those invitations",
                "MALISE. On the spur of the moment.",
                "SIR CHARLES. You play Bridge, sir?",
                "MALISE. Afraid not!",
                "SIR CHARLES. Don't mean that? Then we shall have to wait for 'em.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. I forget, Mr. Malise -- you write, don't you?",
                "MALISE. Such is my weakness.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Delightful profession.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Doesn't tie you! What!",
                "MALISE. Only by the head.",
                "SIR CHARLES. I'm always thinkin' of writin' my experiences.",
                "MALISE. Indeed!",
                "[There is the sound of a door banged.]",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Hastily] You smoke, Mr. MALISE?",
                "MALISE. Too much.",
                "SIR CHARLES. Ah! Must smoke when you think a lot.",
                "MALISE. Or think when you smoke a lot.",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Genially] Don't know that I find that.",

                "The door is opened. CLARE DEDMOND in a cream-coloured evening frock\n        comes in from the hall, followed by GEORGE. She is rather pale, of\n        middle height, with a beautiful figure, wavy brown hair, full, smiling\n        lips, and large grey mesmeric eyes, one of those women all vibration,\n        iced over with a trained stoicism of voice and manner.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Well, my dear!",
                "SIR CHARLES. Ah! George. Good dinner?",

                "CLARE. [Smiling-in a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp] Yes, we\n      met on the door-mat. [Pause.]",
                "SIR CHARLES. Deuce you did! [An awkward pause.]",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [Acidly] Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears. Afraid\n      we shall be rather in the way of music.",
                "SIR CHARLES. What! Aren't we goin' to get a game? [PAYNTER has entered\n      with a tray.]",
                "GEORGE. Paynter! Take that table into the dining room.",

                "SIR CHARLES. Very fine sunset!",
                "Quite softly CLARE begins to laugh. All look at her first with surprise,\n        then with offence, then almost with horror. GEORGE is about to go up to\n        her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Bring the tray along, old man.",
                "GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows HUNTINGDON\n        to shepherd him out.",

                "SIR CHARLES. What? [He marches out.]",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [Meeting MALISE in the doorway] Now you will be able to have\n      your music.",
                "[She follows the GENERAL out] [CLARE stands perfectly still, with her\n        eyes closed.]",
                "MALISE. Delicious!",
                "CLARE. [In her level, clipped voice] Perfectly beastly of me! I'm so\n      sorry. I simply can't help running amok to-night.",
                "MALISE. Never apologize for being fey. It's much too rare.",
                "CLARE. On the door-mat! And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully! Poor\n      dears! I wonder if I ought --  -- [She looks towards the door.]",
                "MALISE. Don't spoil it!",
                "CLARE. I'd been walking up and down the Embankment for about three hours.\n      One does get desperate sometimes.",
                "MALISE. Thank God for that!",
                "CLARE. Only makes it worse afterwards. It seems so frightful to them, too.",
                "MALISE. [Softly and suddenly, but with a difficulty in finding the right\n      words] Blessed be the respectable! May they dream of -- me! And blessed\n      be all men of the world! May they perish of a surfeit of -- good form!",
                "CLARE. I like that. Oh, won't there be a row! [With a faint movement of\n      her shoulders] And the usual reconciliation.",
                "MALISE. Mrs. Dedmond, there's a whole world outside yours. Why don't you\n      spread your wings?",

Moving forward, he rests his hand on the deserted\n        card table, clutching its edge, and muttering. Then he crosses to the\n        door into the hall and switches off the light.

On a smallish table close by, are sheets of paper,\n        cigarette ends, and two claret bottles. There are many books on shelves,\n        and on the floor, an overflowing pile, whereon rests a soft hat, and a\n        black knobby stick. MALISE sits in his armchair, garbed in trousers,\n        dressing-gown, and slippers, unshaved and uncollared, writing. He\n        pauses, smiles, lights a cigarette, and tries the rhythm of the last\n        sentence, holding up a sheet of quarto MS.",
                "MALISE. \"Not a word, not a whisper of Liberty from all those excellent\n      frock-coated gentlemen -- not a sign, not a grimace. Only the\n      monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant Tyranny.\"",
                "While he speaks, a substantial woman, a little over middle-age, in old\n        dark clothes and a black straw hat, enters from the corridor. She goes\n        to a cupboard, brings out from it an apron and a Bissell broom. Her\n        movements are slow and imperturbable, as if she had much time before\n        her. Her face is broad and dark, with Chinese eyebrows.",
                "MALISE. Wait, Mrs. Miller!",
                "MRS. MILER. I'm gettin' be'ind'and, sir.",
                "She comes and stands before him. MALISE writes.",
                "MRS. MILER. There's a man 'angin' about below.",
                "MALISE looks up; seeing that she has roused his attention, she stops.\n        But as soon as he is about to write again, goes on.",
                "MRS. MILER. I see him first yesterday afternoon. I'd just been out to get\n      meself a pennyworth o' soda, an' as I come in I passed 'im on the second\n      floor, lookin' at me with an air of suspicion. I thought to meself at the\n      time, I thought: You're a'andy sort of 'ang-dog man.",
                "MALISE. Well?",
                "MRS. MILER. Well-peekin' down through the balusters, I see 'im lookin' at\n      a photograft. That's a funny place, I thinks, to look at pictures -- it's\n      so dark there, ye 'ave to use yer eyesight. So I giv' a scrape with me\n      'eel [She illustrates] an' he pops it in his pocket, and puts up 'is 'and\n      to knock at number three. I goes down an' I says: \"You know there's no one\n      lives there, don't yer?\" \"Ah!\" 'e says with an air of innercence, \"I wants\n      the name of Smithers.\" \"Oh!\" I says, \"try round the corner, number ten.\"\n      \"Ah!\" 'e says tactful, \"much obliged.\" \"Yes,\" I says, \"you'll find 'im in\n      at this time o' day. Good evenin'!\" And I thinks to meself [She closes one\n      eye] Rats! There's a good many corners hereabouts.",
                "MALISE. [With detached appreciation] Very good, Mrs. Miler.",
                "MRS. MILER. So this mornin', there e' was again on the first floor with\n      'is 'and raised, pretendin' to knock at number two. \"Oh! you're still\n      lookin' for 'im?\" I says, lettin' him see I was 'is grandmother. \"Ah!\" 'e\n      says, affable, \"you misdirected me; it's here I've got my business.\"\n      \"That's lucky,\" I says, \"cos nobody lives there neither. Good mornin'!\"\n      And I come straight up. If you want to see 'im at work you've only to go\n      downstairs, 'e'll be on the ground floor by now, pretendin' to knock at\n      number one. Wonderful resource!",
                "MALISE. What's he like, this gentleman?",
                "MRS. MILER. Just like the men you see on the front page o' the daily\n      papers. Nasty, smooth-lookin' feller, with one o' them billycock hats you\n      can't abide.",
                "MALISE. Isn't he a dun?",
                "MRS. MILER. They don't be'ave like that; you ought to know, sir. He's\n      after no good. [Then, after a little pause] Ain't he to be put a stop to?\n      If I took me time I could get 'im, innercent-like, with a jug o' water.",
                "[MALISE, smiling, shakes his head.]",
                "MALISE. You can get on now; I'm going to shave.",
                "He looks at the clock, and passes out into the inner room. MRS. MILER,\n        gazes round her, pins up her skirt, sits down in the armchair, takes off\n        her hat and puts it on the table, and slowly rolls up her sleeves; then\n        with her hands on her knees she rests. There is a soft knock on the\n        door. She gets up leisurely and moves flat-footed towards it. The door\n        being opened CLARE is revealed.",

[She brings forward a chair and rubs it with her apron.\n      Then goes to the door of the inner room and speaks through it] A lady to\n      see you. [Returning she removes some cigarette ends] This is my hour. I\n      shan't make much dust. [Noting CLARE's eyebrows raised at the debris round\n      the armchair] I'm particular about not disturbin' things.",

                "She lifts a green paper screw of tobacco from the debris round the\n        armchair and taps on the door. It opens. CLARE moves restlessly across\n        the room.",

                "CLARE. Yes.",
                "MALISE. Ah! Proud to have given you that advice. When?",
                "CLARE. The morning after you gave it me...",
                "MALISE. Well?",
                "CLARE. I went down to my people. I knew it would hurt my Dad frightfully,\n      but somehow I thought I could make him see. No good. He was awfully sweet,\n      only -- he couldn't.",

                "CLARE. It was horrible. There were the children -- and my old nurse. I\n      could never live at home now. They'd think I was --  -- . Impossible\n       -- utterly! I'd made up my mind to go back to my owner -- And then -- \n      he came down himself. I couldn't d it. To be hauled back and begin all\n      over again; I simply couldn't. I watched for a chance; and ran to the\n      station, and came up to an hotel.",
                "MALISE. Bravo!",
                "CLARE. I don't know -- no pluck this morning! You see, I've got to earn\n      my living -- no money; only a few things I can sell. All yesterday I\n      was walking about, looking at the women. How does anyone ever get a\n      chance?",
                "MALISE. Sooner than you should hurt his dignity by working, your husband\n      would pension you off.",
                "CLARE. If I don't go back to him I couldn't take it.",
                "MALISE. Good!",
                "CLARE. I've thought of nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate\n      watching pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I\n      came to ask you about the stage.",
                "MALISE. Have you ever acted? [CLARE shakes her head] You mightn't think\n      so, but I've heard there's a prejudice in favour of training. There's\n      Chorus -- I don't recommend it. How about your brother?",
                "CLARE. My brother's got nothing to spare, and he wants to get married; and\n      he's going back to India in September. The only friend I should care to\n      bother is Mrs. Fullarton, and she's -- got a husband.",

[He pauses for an answer, and, not\n      getting one, goes on] Your disappearance has given your husband great\n      anxiety. Really, my dear madam, you must forgive us for this -- attempt\n      to get into communication.",

                "TWISDEN. I'm afraid the answer is that we appear to have been justified.\n      [At the expression on CLARE'S face he goes on hastily] Now, Mrs. Dedmond,\n      I'm a lawyer and I know that appearances are misleading. Don't think I'm\n      unfriendly; I wish you well. [CLARE raises her eyes.

                "SIR CHARLES. Good God!",
                "TWISDEN. Yes! Mrs. Dedmond! There's the bedrock difficulty. As you haven't\n      money, you should never have been pretty. You're up against the world, and\n      you'll get no mercy from it. We lawyers see too much of that. I'm putting\n      it brutally, as a man of the world.",
                "CLARE. Thank you. Do you think you quite grasp the alternative?",
                "TWISDEN. [Taken aback] But, my dear young lady, there are two sides to\n      every contract. After all, your husband's fulfilled his.",

                "LADY DEDMOND. But, my dear, you must live.",

                "SIR CHARLES. But, my dear girl, what the devil's to become of George?",
                "CLARE. He can do what he likes -- it's nothing to me.",
                "TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I say without hesitation you've no notion of what\n      you're faced with, brought up to a sheltered life as you've been. Do\n      realize that you stand at the parting of the ways, and one leads into the\n      wilderness.",
                "CLARE. Which?",

                "LADY DEDMOND. But, my good girl, if you'd let us know where you were, like\n      a reasonable being. You can't possibly be left to yourself without money\n      or position of any kind. Heaven knows what you'd be driven to!",

                "CLARE. I came to Mr. Malise because he's the only person I know with\n      imagination enough to see what my position is; I came to him a quarter of\n      an hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly\n      suspect him. That is disgusting.",

                "CLARE. His woman.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. Will you listen to Reginald?",

                "LADY DEDMOND. Haven't you any religious sense at all, Clare?",
                "CLARE. None, if it's religion to live as we do.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. It's terrible -- this state of mind! It's really\n      terrible!",
                "CLARE breaks into the soft laugh of the other evening. As if galvanized\n        by the sound, SIR CHARLES comes to life out of the transfixed\n        bewilderment with which he has been listening.",

                "CLARE. Right? Whatever else is right -- our life is not. [She puts her\n      hand on her heart] I swear before God that I've tried and tried. I swear\n      before God, that if I believed we could ever again love each other only a\n      little tiny bit, I'd go back. I swear before God that I don't want to hurt\n      anybody.",
                "LADY DEDMOND. But you are hurting everybody. Do -- do be reasonable!",
                "CLARE. [Losing control] Can't you see that I'm fighting for all my life to\n      come -- not to be buried alive -- not to be slowly smothered. Look\n      at me! I'm not wax -- I'm flesh and blood. And you want to prison me\n      for ever -- body and soul.",
                "[They stare at her]",
                "SIR CHARLES. [Suddenly] By Jove! I don't know, I don't know! What!",
                "LADY DEDMOND. [To MALISE] If you have any decency left, sir, you will\n      allow my son, at all events, to speak to his wife alone. [Beckoning to her\n      husband] We'll wait below.",
                "SIR CHARLES. I -- I want to speak. [To CLARE] My dear, if you feel like\n      this, I can only say -- as a -- as a gentleman --  --",

                "GEORGE. You try me pretty high, don't you, forcing me to come here, and\n      speak before this fellow? Most men would think the worst, finding you like\n      this.",
                "CLARE. You need not have come -- or thought at all.",

                "CLARE. I know all those \"certain things.\" \"You must come back. It is your\n      duty. You have no money. Your friends won't help you. You can't earn your\n      living. You are making a scandal.\" You might even say for the moment:\n      \"Your room shall be respected.\"",
                "GEORGE. Well, it's true and you've no answer.",
                "CLARE. Oh! [Suddenly] Our life's a lie. It's stupid; it's disgusting. I'm\n      tired of it! Please leave me alone!",
                "GEORGE. You rather miss the point, I'm afraid. I didn't come here to tell\n      you what you know perfectly well when you're sane. I came here to say\n      this: Anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing.\n      It wouldn't take a baby in. If you think that a gentleman like that [His\n      stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on MALISE]\n      champions a pretty woman for nothing, you make a fairly bad mistake.",

                "CLARE. [Under her breath] Facts!",
                "GEORGE. Oh! for goodness' sake drop that hifalutin' tone. It doesn't suit\n      you. Look here! If you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters\n      until the autumn, I'll let the flat and go to the Club.",
                "CLARE. Put the fire out with a penny hose. [Slowly] I am not coming back\n      to you, George. The farce is over.",
                "GEORGE. [Taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone, suddenly\n      fronts MALISE] Then there is something between you and this fellow.",

                "CLARE. That is noble.",

But\n      on my honour, as a gentleman, I came here this morning for your sake, to\n      warn you of what you're doing. [He turns suddenly on MALISE] And I tell\n      this precious friend of yours plainly what I think of him, and that I'm\n      not going to play into his hands.",

                "MALISE resigns the stick, and the two men, perfectly still, glare at\n        each other. CLARE, letting the stick fall, puts her foot on it. Then\n        slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on the table.",
                "CLARE. Now will you go! [There is silence]",
                "GEORGE. [Staring at her hat] You mad little fool! Understand this; if\n      you've not returned home by three o'clock I'll divorce you, and you may\n      roll in the gutter with this high-souled friend of yours. And mind this,\n      you sir -- I won't spare you -- by God! Your pocket shall suffer.\n      That's the only thing that touches fellows like you.",
                "Turning, he goes out, and slams the door. CLARE and MALISE remain face\n        to face. Her lips have begun to quiver.",
                "CLARE. Horrible!",
                "She turns away, shuddering, and sits down on the edge of the armchair,\n        covering her eyes with the backs of her hands. MALISE picks up the\n        stick, and fingers it lovingly. Then putting it down, he moves so that\n        he can see her face. She is sitting quite still, staring straight before\n        her.",
                "MALISE. Nothing could be better.",

                "She gets up and stands with face averted. Then swiftly turning to him.",

                "MALISE. [Bitterly] Quite right. You've had enough of that.",
                "There is a long silence. Without looking at him she takes up her hat,\n        and puts it on.",

                "HUNTINGDON. I apologize, sir; can I come in a minute?",
                "[MALISE bows with ironical hostility]",
                "HUNTINGDON. I don't know if you remember me -- Clare Dedmond's brother.",
                "MALISE. I remember you.",
                "[He motions to the stolid Boy to go outside again]",
                "HUNTINGDON. I've come to you, sir, as a gentleman --  --",
                "MALISE. Some mistake. There is one, I believe, on the first floor.",
                "HUNTINGDON. It's about my sister.",
                "MALISE. D -- n you! Don't you know that I've been shadowed these last\n      three months? Ask your detectives for any information you want.",
                "HUNTINGDON. We know that you haven't seen her, or even known where she is.",
                "MALISE. Indeed! You've found that out? Brilliant!",
                "HUNTINGDON. We know it from my sister.",
                "MALISE. Oh! So you've tracked her down?",
                "HUNTINGDON. Mrs. Fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big\n      shops -- selling gloves.",
                "MALISE. Mrs. Fullarton the lady with the husband. Well! you've got her.\n      Clap her back into prison.",
                "HUNTINGDON. We have not got her. She left at once, and we don't know where\n      she's gone.",
                "MALISE. Bravo!",
                "HUNTINGDON. [Taking hold of his bit] Look here, Mr. Malise, in a way I\n      share your feeling, but I'm fond of my sister, and it's damnable to have\n      to go back to India knowing she must be all adrift, without protection,\n      going through God knows what! Mrs. Fullarton says she's looking awfully\n      pale and down.",
                "MALISE. [Struggling between resentment and sympathy] Why do you come to\n      me?",
                "HUNTINGDON. We thought --  --",
                "MALISE. Who?",
                "HUNTINGDON. My -- my father and myself.",
                "MALISE. Go on.",
                "HUNTINGDON. We thought there was just a chance that, having lost that job,\n      she might come to you again for advice. If she does, it would be really\n      generous of you if you'd put my father in touch with her. He's getting\n      old, and he feels this very much. [He hands MALISE a card] This is his\n      address.",
                "MALISE. [Twisting the card] Let there be no mistake, sir; I do nothing\n      that will help give her back to her husband. She's out to save her soul\n      alive, and I don't join the hue and cry that's after her. On the contrary -- if\n      I had the power. If your father wants to shelter her, that's another\n      matter. But she'd her own ideas about that.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Perhaps you don't realize how unfit my sister is for rough and\n      tumble. She's not one of this new sort of woman. She's always been looked\n      after, and had things done for her. Pluck she's got, but that's all, and\n      she's bound to come to grief.",
                "MALISE. Very likely -- the first birds do. But if she drops half-way\n      it's better than if she'd never flown. Your sister, sir, is trying the\n      wings of her spirit, out of the old slave market. For women as for men,\n      there's more than one kind of dishonour, Captain Huntingdon, and worse\n      things than being dead, as you may know in your profession.",
                "HUNTINGDON. Admitted -- but --  --",
                "MALISE. We each have our own views as to what they are. But they all come\n      to -- death of our spirits, for the sake of our carcases. Anything\n      more?",
                "HUNTINGDON. My leave's up. I sail to-morrow. If you do see my sister I\n      trust you to give her my love and say I begged she would see my father.",
                "MALISE. If I have the chance -- yes.",
                "He makes a gesture of salute, to which HUNTINGDON responds. Then the\n        latter turns and goes out.",

                "He stands at the window, through which the evening sunlight is powdering\n        the room with smoky gold. The stolid Boy has again come in.

In the\n        doorway he shies violently at the figure of CLARE, standing there in a\n        dark-coloured dress, skids past her and goes. CLARE comes into the gleam\n        of sunlight, her white face alive with emotion or excitement. She looks\n        round her, smiles, sighs; goes swiftly to the door, closes it, and comes\n        back to the table. There she stands, fingering the papers on the table,\n        smoothing MALISE's hat wistfully, eagerly, waiting.",

                "CLARE. My nerves have gone funny lately. It's being always on one's guard,\n      and stuffy air, and feeling people look and talk about you, and dislike\n      your being there.",
                "MALISE. Yes; that wants pluck.",
                "CLARE. [Shaking her head] I curl up all the time. The only thing I know\n      for certain is, that I shall never go back to him. The more I've hated\n      what I've been doing, the more sure I've been. I might come to anything -- but\n      not that.",
                "MALISE. Had a very bad time?",
                "CLARE. [Nodding] I'm spoilt. It's a curse to be a lady when you have to\n      earn your living. It's not really been so hard, I suppose; I've been\n      selling things, and living about twice as well as most shop girls.",
                "MALISE. Were they decent to you?",

[Suddenly looking up at him] Don't think me\n      worse than I am-please! It's working under people; it's having to do it,\n      being driven. I have tried, I've not been altogether a coward, really! But\n      every morning getting there the same time; every day the same stale\n      \"dinner,\" as they call it; every evening the same \"Good evening, Miss\n      Clare,\" \"Good evening, Miss Simpson,\" \"Good evening, Miss Hart,\" \"Good\n      evening, Miss Clare.\" And the same walk home, or the same 'bus; and the\n      same men that you mustn't look at, for fear they'll follow you. [She\n      rises] Oh! and the feeling-always, always -- that there's no sun, or\n      life, or hope, or anything. It was just like being ill, the way I've\n      wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country.

I was\n      doin' my work in there [She points to the room on the right] an' the door\n      open, so I 'earl 'em. Now you've 'ung them curtains, you can't 'elp it.",
                "CLARE. Yes?",
                "MRS. MILER. It's about your divorce case. This 'ere \"Watchfire,\" ye see,\n      belongs to some fellers that won't 'ave their men gettin' into the papers.\n      So this 'ere friend of Mr. Malise -- very nice 'e spoke about it: \"If\n      it comes into Court,\" 'e says, \"you'll 'ave to go,\" 'e says. \"These\n      beggars, these dogs, these dogs,\" 'e says, \"they'll 'oof you out,\" 'e\n      says. An' I could tell by the sound of his voice, 'e meant it -- proper\n      upset 'e was. So that's that!",

                "MRS. MILER. That's what I thinks; but it don't 'elp, do it? \"'Tain't the\n      circulation,\" 'e says, \"it's the principle,\" 'e says; and then 'e starts\n      in swearin' horrible. 'E's a very nice man. And Mr. Malise, 'e says:\n      \"Well, that about does for me!\" 'e says.",
                "CLARE. Thank you, Mrs. Miler -- I'm glad to know.",
                "MRS. MILER. Yes; I don't know as I ought to 'ave told you. [Desperately\n      uncomfortable] You see, I don't take notice of Mr. MALISE, but I know 'im\n      very well. 'E's a good 'arted gentleman, very funny, that'll do things to\n      help others, and what's more, keep on doin' 'em, when they hurt 'im; very\n      obstinate 'e is. Now, when you first come 'ere, three months ago, I says\n      to meself: \"He'll enjoy this 'ere for a bit, but she's too much of a lady\n      for 'im.\" What 'e wants about 'im permanent is a woman that thinks an'\n      talks about all them things he talks about. And sometimes I fancy 'e don't\n      want nothin' permanent about 'im at all.",

                "MRS. MILER. [With another sudden sniff] Gawd knows I don't want to upset\n      ye. You're situated very hard; an' women's got no business to 'urt one\n      another -- that's what I thinks.",
                "CLARE. Will you go out and do something for me? [MRS. MILER nods]",
                "[CLARE takes up the sheaf of papers and from the leather box a note and\n        an emerald pendant]",
                "Take this with the note to that address -- it's quite close. He'll give\n      you thirty pounds for it. Please pay these bills and bring me back the\n      receipts, and what's over.",
                "MRS. MILER. [Taking the pendant and note] It's a pretty thing.",
                "CLARE. Yes. It was my mother's.",
                "MRS. MILER. It's a pity to part with it; ain't you got another?",

                "MRS. FULLARTON. [Disconcerted by the strange greeting] I brought Mr.\n      Twisden to tell you something. May I stay?",
                "CLARE. Yes. [She points to the chair at the same table: MRS. FULLARTON\n      sits down] Now!",
                "[TWISDEN comes forward]",
                "TWISDEN. As you're not defending this case, Mrs. Dedmond, there is nobody\n      but yourself for me to apply to.",

                "TWISDEN. [Bowing slightly] I am instructed by Mr. Dedmond to say that if\n      you will leave your present companion and undertake not to see him again,\n      he will withdraw the suit and settle three hundred a year on you. [At\n      CLARE's movement of abhorrence] Don't misunderstand me, please -- it is\n      not -- it could hardly be, a request that you should go back. Mr.\n      Dedmond is not prepared to receive you again. The proposal -- forgive\n      my saying so -- remarkably Quixotic -- is made to save the scandal\n      to his family and your own. It binds you to nothing but the abandonment of\n      your present companion, with certain conditions of the same nature as to\n      the future. In other words, it assures you a position -- so long as you\n      live quietly by yourself.",
                "CLARE. I see. Will you please thank Mr. Dedmond, and say that I refuse?",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Clare, Clare! For God's sake don't be desperate.",
                "[CLARE, deathly still, just looks at her]",
                "TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I am bound to put the position to you in its naked\n      brutality. You know there's a claim for damages?",
                "CLARE. I have just learnt it.",
                "TWISDEN. You realize what the result of this suit must be: You will be\n      left dependent on an undischarged bankrupt. To put it another way, you'll\n      be a stone round the neck of a drowning man.",
                "CLARE. You are cowards.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Clare, Clare! [To TWISDEN] She doesn't mean it; please be\n      patient.",
                "CLARE. I do mean it. You ruin him because of me. You get him down, and\n      kick him to intimidate me.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. My dear girl! Mr. Twisden is not personally concerned. How\n      can you?",
                "CLARE. If I were dying, and it would save me, I wouldn't take a penny from\n      my husband.",
                "TWISDEN. Nothing could be more bitter than those words. Do you really wish\n      me to take them back to him?",
                "CLARE. Yes. [She turns from them to the fire]",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. [In a low voice to TWISDEN] Please leave me alone with\n      her, don't say anything to Mr. Dedmond yet.",
                "TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I told you once that I wished you well. Though you\n      have called me a coward, I still do that. For God's sake, think -- before\n      it's too late.",
                "CLARE. [Putting out her hand blindly] I'm sorry I called you a coward.\n      It's the whole thing, I meant.",
                "TWISDEN. Never mind that. Think!",
                "With the curious little movement of one who sees something he does not\n        like to see, he goes. CLARE is leaning her forehead against the\n        mantel-shelf, seemingly unconscious that she is not alone. MRS.\n        FULLARTON approaches quietly till she can see CLARE'S face.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. My dear sweet thing, don't be cross with met [CLARE turns\n      from her. It is all the time as if she were trying to get away from words\n      and people to something going on within herself] How can I help wanting to\n      see you saved from all this ghastliness?",
                "CLARE. Please don't, Dolly! Let me be!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. I must speak, Clare! I do think you're hard on George.\n      It's generous of him to offer to withdraw the suit --  considering. You\n      do owe it to us to try and spare your father and your sisters and -- and\n      all of us who care for you.",
                "CLARE. [Facing her] You say George is generous! If he wanted to be that\n      he'd never have claimed these damages. It's revenge he wants -- I heard\n      him here. You think I've done him an injury. So I did -- when I married\n      him. I don't know what I shall come to, Dolly, but I shan't fall so low as\n      to take money from him. That's as certain as that I shall die.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Do you know, Clare, I think it's awful about you! You're\n      too fine, and not fine enough, to put up with things; you're too sensitive\n      to take help, and you're not strong enough to do without it. It's simply\n      tragic. At any rate, you might go home to your people.",
                "CLARE. After this!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. To us, then?",
                "CLARE. \"If I could be the falling bee, and kiss thee all the day!\" No,\n      Dolly!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON turns from her ashamed and baffled, but her quick eyes\n        take in the room, trying to seize on some new point of attack.",

                "CLARE. Aren't I?",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Oh! Clare! Save yourself -- and all of us!",
                "CLARE. [Very still] You see, I love him.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. You used to say you'd never love; did not want it -- \n      would never want it.",
                "CLARE. Did I? How funny!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Oh! my dear! Don't look like that, or you'll make me cry.",
                "CLARE. One doesn't always know the future, does one? [Desperately] I love\n      him! I love him!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. [Suddenly] If you love him, what will it be like for you,\n      knowing you've ruined him?",
                "CLARE. Go away! Go away!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Love! -- you said!",
                "CLARE. [Quivering at that stab-suddenly] I must -- I will keep him.\n      He's all I've got.",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. Can you -- can you keep him?",
                "CLARE. Go!",
                "MRS. FULLARTON. I'm going. But, men are hard to keep, even when you've not\n      been the ruin of them. You know whether the love this man gives you is\n      really love. If not -- God help you! [She turns at the door, and says\n      mournfully] Good-bye, my child! If you can --  --",
                "Then goes. CLARE, almost in a whisper, repeats the words: \"Love! you\n        said!\" At the sound of a latchkey she runs as if to escape into the\n        bedroom, but changes her mind and stands blotted against the curtain of\n        the door. MALISE enters. For a moment he does not see her standing there\n        against the curtain that is much the same colour as her dress. His face\n        is that of a man in the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent.\n        Then, seeing her, he pulls himself together, walks to his armchair, and\n        sits down there in his hat and coat.",
                "CLARE. Well? \"The Watchfire?\" You may as well tell me.",
                "MALISE. Nothing to tell you, child.",
                "At that touch of tenderness she goes up to his chair and kneels down\n        beside it. Mechanically MALISE takes off his hat.",
                "CLARE. Then you are to lose that, too? [MALISE stares at her] I know about\n      it -- never mind how.",
                "MALISE. Sanctimonious dogs!",
                "CLARE. [Very low] There are other things to be got, aren't there?",
                "MALISE. Thick as blackberries. I just go out and cry, \"MALISE,\n      unsuccessful author, too honest journalist, freethinker, co-respondent,\n      bankrupt,\" and they tumble!",
                "CLARE. [Quietly] Kenneth, do you care for me? [MALISE stares at her] Am I\n      anything to you but just prettiness?",
                "MALISE. Now, now! This isn't the time to brood! Rouse up and fight.",
                "CLARE. Yes.",
                "MALISE. We're not going to let them down us, are we? [She rubs her cheek\n      against his hand, that still rests on her shoulder] Life on sufferance,\n      breath at the pleasure of the enemy! And some day in the fullness of his\n      mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe\n      again. [His gesture sums up the rage within him] Fine! [He puts his hat on\n      and rises] That's the last groan they get from me.",
                "CLASS. Are you going out again? [He nods] Where?",
                "MALISE. Blackberrying! Our train's not till six.",
                "He goes into the bedroom. CLARE gets up and stands by the fire, looking\n        round in a dazed way. She puts her hand up and mechanically gathers\n        together the violets in the little vase. Suddenly she twists them to a\n        buttonhole, and sinks down into the armchair, which he must pass. There\n        she sits, the violets in her hand. MALISE comes out and crosses towards\n        the outer door. She puts the violets up to him. He stares at them,\n        shrugs his shoulders, and passes on. For just a moment CLARE sits\n        motionless.",
                "CLARE. [Quietly] Give me a kiss!",
                "He turns and kisses her. But his lips, after that kiss, have the furtive\n        bitterness one sees on the lips of those who have done what does not\n        suit their mood. He goes out. She is left motionless by the armchair,\n        her throat working. Then, feverishly, she goes to the little table,\n        seizes a sheet of paper, and writes. Looking up suddenly she sees that\n        MRS. MILER has let herself in with her latchkey.",
                "MRS. MILER. I've settled the baker, the milk, the washin' an' the\n      groceries -- this 'ere's what's left.",
                "She counts down a five-pound note, four sovereigns, and two shillings on\n        to the little table. CLARE folds the letter into an envelope, then takes\n        up the five-pound note and puts it into her dress.",
                "CLARE. [Pointing to the money on the table] Take your wages; and give him\n      this when he comes in. I'm going away.",
                "MRS. MILER. Without him? When'll you be comin' back?",
                "CLARE. [Rising] I shan't be coming back. [Gazing at MRS. MILER'S hands,\n      which are plaiting at her dress] I'm leaving Mr. Malise, and shan't see\n      him again. And the suit against us will be withdrawn -- the divorce\n      suit -- you understand?",
                "MRS. MILER. [Her face all broken up] I never meant to say anything to yer.",
                "CLARE. It's not you. I can see for myself. Don't make it harder; help me.\n      Get a cab.",

And even after the\n        PORTER has shouldered the trunk outside, and marched away, and MRS.\n        MILER has come back into the room, CLARE still stands there.",

                "Supper-time in a small room at \"The Gascony\" on Derby Day. Through the\n        windows of a broad corridor, out of which the door opens, is seen the\n        dark blue of a summer night. The walls are of apricot-gold; the carpets,\n        curtains, lamp-shades, and gilded chairs, of red; the wood-work and\n        screens white; the palms in gilded tubs. A doorway that has no door\n        leads to another small room. One little table behind a screen, and one\n        little table in the open, are set for two persons each. On a\n        service-table, above which hangs a speaking-tube, are some dishes of\n        hors d'ouvres, a basket of peaches, two bottles of champagne in\n        ice-pails, and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub. ARNAUD, the\n        waiter, slim, dark, quick, his face seamed with a quiet, soft irony, is\n        opening oysters and listening to the robust joy of a distant\n        supper-party, where a man is playing the last bars of: \"Do ye ken John\n        Peel\" on a horn. As the sound dies away, he murmurs: \"Tres Joli!\" and\n        opens another oyster. Two Ladies with bare shoulders and large hats pass\n        down the corridor. Their talk is faintly wafted in: \"Well, I never like\n        Derby night! The boys do get so bobbish!\" \"That horn -- vulgar, I\n        call it!\" ARNAUD'S eyebrows rise, the corners of his mouth droop. A Lady\n        with bare shoulders, and crimson roses in her hair, comes along the\n        corridor, and stops for a second at the window, for a man to join her.\n        They come through into the room. ARNAUD has sprung to attention, but\n        with: \"Let's go in here, shall we?\" they pass through into the further\n        room. The MANAGER, a gentleman with neat moustaches, and buttoned into a\n        frock-coat, has appeared, brisk, noiseless, his eyes everywhere; he\n        inspects the peaches.",
                "MANAGER. Four shillin' apiece to-night, see?",
                "ARNAUD. Yes, Sare.",
                "From the inner room a young man and his partner have come in. She is\n        dark, almost Spanish-looking; he fair, languid, pale, clean-shaved,\n        slackly smiling, with half-closed eyes-one of those who are bred and\n        dissipated to the point of having lost all save the capacity for hiding\n        their emotions. He speaks in a --  --",

Seeing them safely landed, the\n        MANAGER, brisk and noiseless, moves away. In the corridor a lady in\n        black, with a cloak falling open, seems uncertain whether to come in.\n        She advances into the doorway. It is CLARE.",
                "ARNAUD. [Pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes] Nice table,\n      Madame.",
                "CLARE moves to the corner of it. An artist in observation of his\n        clients, ARNAUD takes in her face -- very pale under her wavy,\n        simply-dressed hair; shadowy beneath the eyes; not powdered; her lips\n        not reddened; without a single ornament; takes in her black dress,\n        finely cut, her arms and neck beautifully white, and at her breast three\n        gardenias.

Will you have supper with me here to-morrow night?\"\n        Startled out of her reverie, CLARE looks up. She sees those eyes, she\n        sees beyond him the eyes of his companion-sly, malevolent,\n        amused-watching; and she just sits gazing, without a word. At that\n        regard, so clear, the BLOND ONE does not wince. But rather suddenly he\n        says: \"That's arranged then. Half-past eleven. So good of you.\n        Good-night!\" He replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion,\n        and in a low voice says: \"Pay up!\" Then at a languid \"Hullo, Charles!\"\n        they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen. CLARE has\n        not moved, nor changed the direction of her gaze. Suddenly she thrusts\n        her hand into the, pocket of the cloak that hangs behind her, and brings\n        out the little blue bottle which, six months ago, she took from MALISE.\n        She pulls out the cork and pours the whole contents into her champagne.\n        She lifts the glass, holds it before her -- smiling, as if to call a\n        toast, then puts it to her lips and drinks. Still smiling, she sets the\n        empty glass down, and lays the gardenia flowers against her face. Slowly\n        she droops back in her chair, the drowsy smile still on her lips; the\n        gardenias drop into her lap; her arms relax, her head falls forward on\n        her breast. And the voices behind the screen talk on, and the sounds of\n        joy from the supper-party wax and wane. The waiter, ARNAUD, returning\n        from the corridor, passes to his service-table with a tall, beribboned\n        basket of fruit. Putting it down, he goes towards the table behind the\n        screen, and sees. He runs up to CLARE.",
