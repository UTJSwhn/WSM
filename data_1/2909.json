                "ACT I",
                "SCENE I",
                "The scene is a well-lighted, and large, oak-panelled hall, with an air\n        of being lived in, and a broad, oak staircase. The dining-room,\n        drawing-room, billiard-room, all open into it; and under the staircase a\n        door leads to the servants' quarters. In a huge fireplace a log fire is\n        burning. There are tiger-skins on the floor, horns on the walls; and a\n        writing-table against the wall opposite the fireplace. FREDA STUDDENHAM,\n        a pretty, pale girl with dark eyes, in the black dress of a lady's-maid,\n        is standing at the foot of the staircase with a bunch of white roses in\n        one hand, and a bunch of yellow roses in the other. A door closes above,\n        and SIR WILLIAM CHESHIRE, in evening dress, comes downstairs. He is\n        perhaps fifty-eight, of strong build, rather bull-necked, with grey\n        eyes, and a well-coloured face, whose choleric autocracy is veiled by a\n        thin urbanity. He speaks before he reaches the bottom.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Well, Freda! Nice roses. Who are they for?",
                "FREDA. My lady told me to give the yellow to Mrs. Keith, Sir William, and\n      the white to Miss Lanfarne, for their first evening.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Capital. [Passing on towards the drawing-room] Your father\n      coming up to-night?",
                "FREDA. Yes.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Be good enough to tell him I specially want to see him here\n      after dinner, will you?",
                "FREDA. Yes, Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. By the way, just ask him to bring the game-book in, if he's\n      got it.",
                "He goes out into the drawing-room; and FREDA stands restlessly tapping\n        her foot against the bottom stair. With a flutter of skirts CHRISTINE\n        KEITH comes rapidly down. She is a nice-looking, fresh-coloured young\n        woman in a low-necked dress.",
                "CHRISTINE. Hullo, Freda! How are YOU?",
                "FREDA. Quite well, thank you, Miss Christine -- Mrs. Keith, I mean. My\n      lady told me to give you these.",
                "CHRISTINE. [Taking the roses] Oh! Thanks! How sweet of mother!",
                "FREDA. [In a quick, toneless voice] The others are for Miss Lanfarne. My\n      lady thought white would suit her better.",
                "CHRISTINE. They suit you in that black dress.",
                "[FREDA lowers the roses quickly.]",
                "What do you think of Joan's engagement?",
                "FREDA. It's very nice for her.",
                "CHRISTINE. I say, Freda, have they been going hard at rehearsals?",
                "FREDA. Every day. Miss Dot gets very cross, stage-managing.",
                "CHRISTINE. I do hate learning a part. Thanks awfully for unpacking. Any\n      news?",
                "FREDA. [In the same quick, dull voice] The under-keeper, Dunning, won't\n      marry Rose Taylor, after all.",
                "CHRISTINE. What a shame! But I say that's serious. I thought there was -- she\n      was -- I mean --  --",
                "FREDA. He's taken up with another girl, they say.",
                "CHRISTINE. Too bad! [Pinning the roses] D'you know if Mr. Bill's come?",
                "FREDA. [With a swift upward look] Yes, by the six-forty.",
                "RONALD KEITH comes slowly down, a weathered firm-lipped man, in evening\n        dress, with eyelids half drawn over his keen eyes, and the air of a\n        horseman.",
                "KEITH. Hallo! Roses in December. I say, Freda, your father missed a\n      wigging this morning when they drew blank at Warnham's spinney. Where's\n      that litter of little foxes?",
                "FREDA. [Smiling faintly] I expect father knows, Captain Keith.",
                "KEITH. You bet he does. Emigration? Or thin air? What?",
                "CHRISTINE. Studdenham'd never shoot a fox, Ronny. He's been here since the\n      flood.",
                "KEITH. There's more ways of killing a cat -- eh, Freda?",
                "CHRISTINE. [Moving with her husband towards the drawing-room] Young\n      Dunning won't marry that girl, Ronny.",
                "KEITH. Phew! Wouldn't be in his shoes, then! Sir William'll never keep a\n      servant who's made a scandal in the village, old girl. Bill come?",
                "As they disappear from the hall, JOHN LATTER in a clergyman's evening\n        dress, comes sedately downstairs, a tall, rather pale young man, with\n        something in him, as it were, both of heaven, and a drawing-room. He\n        passes FREDA with a formal little nod. HAROLD, a fresh-cheeked,\n        cheery-looking youth, comes down, three steps at a time.",
                "HAROLD. Hallo, Freda! Patience on the monument. Let's have a sniff! For\n      Miss Lanfarne? Bill come down yet?",
                "FREDA. No, Mr. Harold.",
                "HAROLD crosses the hall, whistling, and follows LATTER into the\n        drawing-room. There is the sound of a scuffle above, and a voice crying:\n        \"Shut up, Dot!\" And JOAN comes down screwing her head back. She is\n        pretty and small, with large clinging eyes.",
                "JOAN. Am I all right behind, Freda? That beast, Dot!",
                "FREDA. Quite, Miss Joan.",
                "DOT's face, like a full moon, appears over the upper banisters. She too\n        comes running down, a frank figure, with the face of a rebel.",
                "DOT. You little being!",
                "JOAN. [Flying towards the drawing-roam, is overtaken at the door] Oh! Dot!\n      You're pinching!",
                "As they disappear into the drawing-room, MABEL LANFARNE, a tall girl\n        with a rather charming Irish face, comes slowly down. And at sight of\n        her FREDA's whole figure becomes set and meaningfull.",
                "FREDA. For you, Miss Lanfarne, from my lady.",
                "MABEL. [In whose speech is a touch of wilful Irishry] How sweet!\n      [Fastening the roses] And how are you, Freda?",
                "FREDA. Very well, thank you.",
                "MABEL. And your father? Hope he's going to let me come out with the guns\n      again.",
                "FREDA. [Stolidly] He'll be delighted, I'm sure.",
                "MABEL. Ye-es! I haven't forgotten his face-last time.",
                "FREDA. You stood with Mr. Bill. He's better to stand with than Mr. Harold,\n      or Captain Keith?",
                "MABEL. He didn't touch a feather, that day.",
                "FREDA. People don't when they're anxious to do their best.",
                "A gong sounds. And MABEL LANFARNE, giving FREDA a rather inquisitive\n        stare, moves on to the drawing-room. Left alone without the roses, FREDA\n        still lingers. At the slamming of a door above, and hasty footsteps, she\n        shrinks back against the stairs. BILL runs down, and comes on her\n        suddenly. He is a tall, good-looking edition of his father, with the\n        same stubborn look of veiled choler.",
                "BILL. Freda! [And as she shrinks still further back] what's the matter?\n      [Then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away from her]\n      Aren't you glad to see me?",
                "FREDA. I've something to say to you, Mr. Bill. After dinner.",
                "BILL. Mister --  -- ?",
                "She passes him, and rushes away upstairs. And BILL, who stands frowning\n        and looking after her, recovers himself sharply as the drawing-room door\n        is opened, and SIR WILLIAM and MISS LANFARNE come forth, followed by\n        KEITH, DOT, HAROLD, CHRISTINE, LATTER, and JOAN, all leaning across each\n        other, and talking. By herself, behind them, comes LADY CHESHIRE, a\n        refined-looking woman of fifty, with silvery dark hair, and an\n        expression at once gentle, and ironic. They move across the hall towards\n        the dining-room.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Ah! Bill.",
                "MABEL. How do you do?",
                "KEITH. How are you, old chap?",
                "DOT. [gloomily] Do you know your part?",
                "HAROLD. Hallo, old man!",
                "CHRISTINE gives her brother a flying kiss. JOAN and LATTER pause and look\n      at him shyly without speech.",
                "BILL. [Putting his hand on JOAN's shoulder] Good luck, you two! Well\n      mother?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Well, my dear boy! Nice to see you at last. What a long\n      time!",
                "She draws his arm through hers, and they move towards the dining-room.\n        The curtain falls. The curtain rises again at once.",
                "SCENE II",
                "CHRISTINE, LADY CHESHIRE, DOT, MABEL LANFARNE, and JOAN, are returning\n        to the hall after dinner.",
                "CHRISTINE. [in a low voice] Mother, is it true about young Dunning and\n      Rose Taylor?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid so, dear.",
                "CHRISTINE. But can't they be --  --",
                "DOT. Ah! ah-h! [CHRISTINE and her mother are silent.] My child, I'm not\n      the young person.",
                "CHRISTINE. No, of course not -- only -- [nodding towards JOAN and\n      Mable].",
                "DOT. Look here! This is just an instance of what I hate.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. My dear? Another one?",
                "DOT. Yes, mother, and don't you pretend you don't understand, because you\n      know you do.",
                "CHRISTINE. Instance? Of what?",
                "JOAN and MABEL have ceased talking, and listen, still at the fire.",
                "DOT. Humbug, of course. Why should you want them to marry, if he's tired\n      of her?",
                "CHRISTINE. [Ironically] Well! If your imagination doesn't carry you as far\n      as that!",
                "DOT. When people marry, do you believe they ought to be in love with each\n      other?",
                "CHRISTINE. [With a shrug] That's not the point.",
                "DOT. Oh? Were you in love with Ronny?",
                "CHRISTINE. Don't be idiotic!",
                "DOT. Would you have married him if you hadn't been?",
                "CHRISTINE. Of course not!",
                "JOAN. Dot! You are! --  --",
                "DOT. Hallo! my little snipe!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Dot, dear!",
                "DOT. Don't shut me up, mother! [To JOAN.] Are you in love with John? [JOAN\n      turns hurriedly to the fire.] Would you be going to marry him if you were\n      not?",
                "CHRISTINE. You are a brute, Dot.",
                "DOT. Is Mabel in love with -- whoever she is in love with?",
                "MABEL. And I wonder who that is.",
                "DOT. Well, would you marry him if you weren't?",
                "MABEL. No, I would not.",
                "DOT. Now, mother; did you love father?",
                "CHRISTINE. Dot, you really are awful.",
                "DOT. [Rueful and detached] Well, it is a bit too thick, perhaps.",
                "JOAN. Dot!",
                "DOT. Well, mother, did you -- I mean quite calmly?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Yes, dear, quite calmly.",
                "DOT. Would you have married him if you hadn't? [LADY CHESHIRE shakes her\n      head] Then we're all agreed!",
                "MABEL. Except yourself.",
                "DOT. [Grimly] Even if I loved him, he might think himself lucky if I\n      married him.",
                "MABEL. Indeed, and I'm not so sure.",
                "DOT. [Making a face at her] What I was going to --  --",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. But don't you think, dear, you'd better not?",
                "DOT. Well, I won't say what I was going to say, but what I do say is -- Why\n      the devil --  --",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Quite so, Dot!",
                "DOT. [A little disconcerted.] If they're tired of each other, they ought\n      not to marry, and if father's going to make them --  --",
                "CHRISTINE. You don't understand in the least. It's for the sake of the --  --",
                "DOT. Out with it, Old Sweetness! The approaching infant! God bless it!",
                "There is a sudden silence, for KEITH and LATTER are seen coming from the\n        dining-room.",
                "LATTER. That must be so, Ronny.",
                "KEITH. No, John; not a bit of it!",
                "LATTER. You don't think!",
                "KEITH. Good Gad, who wants to think after dinner!",
                "DOT. Come on! Let's play pool. [She turns at the billiard-room door.] Look\n      here! Rehearsal to-morrow is directly after breakfast; from \"Eccles enters\n      breathless\" to the end.",
                "MABEL. Whatever made you choose \"Caste,\" DOT? You know it's awfully\n      difficult.",
                "DOT. Because it's the only play that's not too advanced. [The girls all go\n      into the billiard-room.]",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Where's Bill, Ronny?",
                "KEITH. [With a grimace] I rather think Sir William and he are in Committee\n      of Supply -- Mem-Sahib.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Oh!",
                "She looks uneasily at the dining-room; then follows the girls out.",
                "LATTER. [In the tone of one resuming an argument] There can't be two\n      opinions about it, Ronny. Young Dunning's refusal is simply indefensible.",
                "KEITH. I don't agree a bit, John.",
                "LATTER. Of course, if you won't listen.",
                "KEITH. [Clipping a cigar] Draw it mild, my dear chap. We've had the whole\n      thing over twice at least.",
                "LATTER. My point is this --  --",
                "KEITH. [Regarding LATTER quizzically with his halfclosed eyes] I know -- I\n      know -- but the point is, how far your point is simply professional.",
                "LATTER. If a man wrongs a woman, he ought to right her again. There's no\n      answer to that.",
                "KEITH. It all depends.",
                "LATTER. That's rank opportunism.",
                "KEITH. Rats! Look here -- Oh! hang it, John, one can't argue this out\n      with a parson.",
                "LATTER. [Frigidly] Why not?",
                "HAROLD. [Who has entered from the dining-room] Pull devil, pull baker!",
                "KEITH. Shut up, Harold!",
                "LATTER. \"To play the game\" is the religion even of the Army.",
                "KEITH. Exactly, but what is the game?",
                "LATTER. What else can it be in this case?",
                "KEITH. You're too puritanical, young John. You can't help it -- line of\n      country laid down for you. All drag-huntin'! What!",
                "LATTER. [With concentration] Look here!",
                "HAROLD. [Imitating the action of a man pulling at a horse's head] 'Come\n      hup, I say, you hugly beast!'",
                "KEITH. [To LATTER] You're not going to draw me, old chap. You don't see\n      where you'd land us all. [He smokes calmly]",
                "LATTER. How do you imagine vice takes its rise? From precisely this sort\n      of thing of young Dunning's.",
                "KEITH. From human nature, I should have thought, John. I admit that I\n      don't like a fellow's leavin' a girl in the lurch; but I don't see the use\n      in drawin' hard and fast rules. You only have to break 'em. Sir William\n      and you would just tie Dunning and the girl up together, willy-nilly, to\n      save appearances, and ten to one but there'll be the deuce to pay in a\n      year's time. You can take a horse to the water, you can't make him drink.",
                "LATTER. I entirely and absolutely disagree with you.",
                "HAROLD. Good old John!",
                "LATTER. At all events we know where your principles take you.",
                "KEITH. [Rather dangerously] Where, please? [HAROLD turns up his eyes, and\n      points downwards] Dry up, Harold!",
                "LATTER. Did you ever hear the story of Faust?",
                "KEITH. Now look here, John; with all due respect to your cloth, and all\n      the politeness in the world, you may go to-blazes.",
                "LATTER. Well, I must say, Ronny -- of all the rude boors --  -- [He\n      turns towards the billiard-room.]",
                "KEITH. Sorry I smashed the glass, old chap.",
                "LATTER passes out. There comes a mingled sound through the opened door,\n        of female voices, laughter, and the click of billiard balls, dipped of\n        by the sudden closing of the door.",
                "KEITH. [Impersonally] Deuced odd, the way a parson puts one's back up!\n      Because you know I agree with him really; young Dunning ought to play the\n      game; and I hope Sir William'll make him.",
                "The butler JACKSON has entered from the door under the stairs followed\n        by the keeper STUDDENHAM, a man between fifty and sixty, in a\n        full-skirted coat with big pockets, cord breeches, and gaiters; he has a\n        steady self respecting weathered face, with blue eyes and a short grey\n        beard, which has obviously once been red.",
                "KEITH. Hullo! Studdenham!",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Touching his forehead] Evenin', Captain Keith.",
                "JACKSON. Sir William still in the dining-room with Mr. Bill, sir?",
                "HAROLD. [With a grimace] He is, Jackson.",
                "JACKSON goes out to the dining-room.",
                "KEITH. You've shot no pheasants yet, Studdenham?",
                "STUDDENHAM. No, Sir. Only birds. We'll be doin' the spinneys and the home\n      covert while you're down.",
                "KEITH. I say, talkin' of spinneys --  --",
                "He breaks off sharply, and goes out with HAROLD into the billiard-room.\n        SIR WILLIAM enters from the dining-room, applying a gold toothpick to\n        his front teeth.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Ah! Studdenham. Bad business this, about young Dunning!",
                "STUDDENHAM. Yes, Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. He definitely refuses to marry her?",
                "STUDDENHAM. He does that.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. That won't do, you know. What reason does he give?",
                "STUDDENHAM. Won't say other than that he don't want no more to do with\n      her.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. God bless me! That's not a reason. I can't have a keeper of\n      mine playing fast and loose in the village like this. [Turning to LADY\n      CHESHIRE, who has come in from the billiard-room] That affair of young\n      Dunning's, my dear.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! Yes! I'm so sorry, Studdenham. The poor girl!",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Respectfully] Fancy he's got a feeling she's not his equal,\n      now, my lady.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [To herself] Yes, I suppose he has made her his superior.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What? Eh! Quite! Quite! I was just telling Studdenham the\n      fellow must set the matter straight. We can't have open scandals in the\n      village. If he wants to keep his place he must marry her at once.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [To her husband in a low voice] Is it right to force them?\n      Do you know what the girl wishes, Studdenham?",
                "STUDDENHAM. Shows a spirit, my lady -- says she'll have him -- willin'\n      or not.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. A spirit? I see. If they marry like that they're sure to be\n      miserable.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What! Doesn't follow at all. Besides, my dear, you ought to\n      know by this time, there's an unwritten law in these matters. They're\n      perfectly well aware that when there are consequences, they have to take\n      them.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Some o' these young people, my lady, they don't put two and\n      two together no more than an old cock pheasant.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I'll give him till to-morrow. If he remains obstinate, he'll\n      have to go; he'll get no character, Studdenham. Let him know what I've\n      said. I like the fellow, he's a good keeper. I don't want to lose him. But\n      this sort of thing I won't have. He must toe the mark or take himself off.\n      Is he up here to-night?",
                "STUDDENHAM. Hangin' partridges, Sir William. Will you have him in?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Hesitating] Yes -- yes. I'll see him.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Good-night to you, my lady.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Freda's not looking well, Studdenham.",
                "STUDDENHAM. She's a bit pernickitty with her food, that's where it is.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I must try and make her eat.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Oh! Studdenham. We'll shoot the home covert first. What did\n      we get last year?",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Producing the game-book; but without reference to it] Two\n      hundred and fifty-three pheasants, eleven hares, fifty-two rabbits, three\n      woodcock, sundry.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Sundry? Didn't include a fox did it? [Gravely] I was\n      seriously upset this morning at Warnham's spinney --  --",
                "SUDDENHAM. [Very gravely] You don't say, Sir William; that four-year-old\n      he du look a handful!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a sharp look] You know well enough what I mean.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Unmoved] Shall I send young Dunning, Sir William?",
                "SIR WILLIAM gives a short, sharp nod, and STUDDENHAM retires by the door\n        under the stairs.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Old fox!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Don't be too hard on Dunning. He's very young.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Patting her arm] My dear, you don't understand young\n      fellows, how should you?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [With her faint irony] A husband and two sons not counting.\n      [Then as the door under the stairs is opened] Bill, now do --  --",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I'll be gentle with him. [Sharply] Come in!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE retires to the billiard-room. She gives a look back and a\n        half smile at young DUNNING, a fair young man dressed in broom cords and\n        leggings, and holding his cap in his hand; then goes out.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Evenin', Dunning.",
                "DUNNING. [Twisting his cap] Evenin', Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Studdenham's told you what I want to see you about?",
                "DUNNING. Yes, Sir.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. The thing's in your hands. Take it or leave it. I don't put\n      pressure on you. I simply won't have this sort of thing on my estate.",
                "DUNNING. I'd like to say, Sir William, that she [He stops].",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Yes, I daresay-Six of one and half a dozen of the other.\n      Can't go into that.",
                "DUNNING. No, Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I'm quite mild with you. This is your first place. If you\n      leave here you'll get no character.",
                "DUNNING. I never meant any harm, sir.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. My good fellow, you know the custom of the country.",
                "DUNNING. Yes, Sir William, but --  --",
                "SIR WILLIAM. You should have looked before you leaped. I'm not forcing\n      you. If you refuse you must go, that's all.",
                "DUNNING. Yes. Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Well, now go along and take a day to think it over.",

                "DUNNING. Very good, Sir William. [He turns, fumbles, and turns again] My\n      old mother's dependent on me --  --",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Now, Dunning, I've no more to say. [Dunning goes sadly away\n        under the stairs.]",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Following] And look here! Just understand this [He too\n        goes out....] BILL, lighting a cigarette, has approached the\n        writing-table. He looks very glum. The billiard-room door is flung open.\n        MABEL LANFARNE appears, and makes him a little curtsey.",
                "MABEL. Against my will I am bidden to bring you in to pool.",
                "BILL. Sorry! I've got letters.",
                "MABEL. You seem to have become very conscientious.",
                "BILL. Oh! I don't know.",
                "MABEL. Do you remember the last day of the covert shooting?",
                "BITS. I do.",
                "MABEL. [Suddenly] What a pretty girl Freda Studdenham's grown!",
                "BILL. Has she?",
                "MABEL. \"She walks in beauty.\"",
                "BILL. Really? Hadn't noticed.",
                "MABEL. Have you been taking lessons in conversation?",
                "BILL. Don't think so.",
                "MABEL. Oh! [There is a silence] Mr. Cheshire!",
                "BILL. Miss Lanfarne!",
                "MABEL. What's the matter with you? Aren't you rather queer, considering\n      that I don't bite, and was rather a pal!",
                "BILL. [Stolidly] I'm sorry.",
                "Then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiard-room, he sits\n        down at the writing-table.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Mabel, dear, do take my cue. Won't you play too, Bill, and\n      try and stop Ronny, he's too terrible?",
                "BILL. Thanks. I've got these letters.",
                "MABEL taking the cue passes back into the billiard-room, whence comes out\n      the sound of talk and laughter.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Going over and standing behind her son's chair] Anything\n      wrong, darling?",
                "BILL. Nothing, thanks. [Suddenly] I say, I wish you hadn't asked that girl\n      here.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Mabel! Why? She's wanted for rehearsals. I thought you got\n      on so well with her last Christmas.",
                "BILL. [With a sort of sullen exasperation.] A year ago.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. The girls like her, so does your father; personally I must\n      say I think she's rather nice and Irish.",
                "BILL. She's all right, I daresay.",
                "He looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be left alone.\n        But LADY CHESHIRE, having seen that he is about to look at her, is not\n        looking at him.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid your father's been talking to you, Bill.",
                "BILL. He has.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Debts? Do try and make allowances. [With a faint smile] Of\n      course he is a little --  --",
                "BILL. He is.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I wish I could --  --",
                "BILL. Oh, Lord! Don't you get mixed up in it!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. It seems almost a pity that you told him.",
                "BILL. He wrote and asked me point blank what I owed.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! [Forcing herself to speak in a casual voice] I happen\n      to have a little money, Bill -- I think it would be simpler if --  --",
                "BILL. Now look here, mother, you've tried that before. I can't help\n      spending money, I never shall be able, unless I go to the Colonies, or\n      something of the kind.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Don't talk like that, dear!",
                "BILL. I would, for two straws!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. It's only because your father thinks such a lot of the\n      place, and the name, and your career. The Cheshires are all like that.\n      They've been here so long; they're all -- root.",
                "BILL. Deuced funny business my career will be, I expect!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Fluttering, but restraining herself lest he should see]\n      But, Bill, why must you spend more than your allowance?",
                "BILL. Why -- anything? I didn't make myself.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid we did that. It was inconsiderate, perhaps.",
                "BILL. Yes, you'd better have left me out.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. But why are you so -- Only a little fuss about money!",
                "BILL. Ye-es.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. You're not keeping anything from me, are you?",
                "BILL. [Facing her] No. [He then turns very deliberately to the writing\n      things, and takes up a pen] I must write these letters, please.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Bill, if there's any real trouble, you will tell me, won't\n      you?",
                "BILL. There's nothing whatever.",
                "He suddenly gets up and walks about. LADY CHESHIRE, too, moves over to\n        the fireplace, and after an uneasy look at him, turns to the fire. Then,\n        as if trying to switch of his mood, she changes the subject abruptly.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Isn't it a pity about young Dunning? I'm so sorry for Rose\n      Taylor.",
                "There is a silence. Stealthily under the staircase FREDA has entered,\n        and seeing only BILL, advances to speak to him.",
                "BILL. [Suddenly] Oh! well, -- you can't help these things in the\n      country.",
                "As he speaks, FREDA stops dead, perceiving that he is not alone; BILL,\n        too, catching sight of her, starts.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Still speaking to the fire] It seems dreadful to force\n      him. I do so believe in people doing things of their own accord. [Then\n      seeing FREDA standing so uncertainly by the stairs] Do you want me, Freda?",
                "FREDA. Only your cloak, my lady. Shall I -- begin it?",
                "At this moment SIR WILLIAM enters from the drawing-room.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Yes, yes.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Genially] Can you give me another five minutes, Bill?\n      [Pointing to the billiard-room] We'll come directly, my dear.",
                "FREDA, with a look at BILL, has gone back whence she came; and LADY\n        CHESHIRE goes reluctantly away into the billiard-room.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I shall give young Dunning short shrift. [He moves over to\n      the fireplace and divides hip coat-tails] Now, about you, Bill! I don't\n      want to bully you the moment you come down, but you know, this can't go\n      on. I've paid your debts twice. Shan't pay them this time unless I see a\n      disposition to change your mode of life. [A pause] You get your\n      extravagance from your mother. She's very queer -- [A pause] -- All\n      the Winterleighs are like that about money....",
                "BILL. Mother's particularly generous, if that's what you mean.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Drily] We will put it that way. [A pause] At the present\n      moment you owe, as I understand it, eleven hundred pounds.",
                "BILL. About that.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Mere flea-bite. [A pause] I've a proposition to make.",
                "BILL. Won't it do to-morrow, sir?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. \"To-morrow\" appears to be your motto in life.",
                "BILL. Thanks!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I'm anxious to change it to-day. [BILL looks at him in\n      silence] It's time you took your position seriously, instead of hanging\n      about town, racing, and playing polo, and what not.",
                "BILL. Go ahead!",
                "At something dangerous in his voice, SIR WILLIAM modifies his attitude.",
                "SIR, WILLIAM. The proposition's very simple. I can't suppose anything so\n      rational and to your advantage will appeal to you, but [drily] I mention\n      it. Marry a nice girl, settle down, and stand for the division; you can\n      have the Dower House and fifteen hundred a year, and I'll pay your debts\n      into the bargain. If you're elected I'll make it two thousand. Plenty of\n      time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal Rads.\n      Carpetbagger against you; if you go hard at it in the summer, it'll be odd\n      if you don't manage to get in your three days a week, next season. You can\n      take Rocketer and that four-year-old -- he's well up to your weight,\n      fully eight and a half inches of bone. You'll only want one other. And if\n      Miss -- if your wife means to hunt --  --",
                "BILL. You've chosen my wife, then?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a quick look] I imagine, you've some girl in your mind.",
                "BILL. Ah!",
                "SIR WILLIAM: Used not to be unnatural at your age. I married your mother\n      at twenty-eight. Here you are, eldest son of a family that stands for\n      something. The more I see of the times the more I'm convinced that\n      everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to, and save the landmarks\n      left. Unless we're true to our caste, and prepared to work for it, the\n      landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in\n      the air. The outlook's very serious. We're threatened in a hundred ways.\n      If you mean business, you'll want a wife. When I came into the property I\n      should have been lost without your mother.",
                "BILL. I thought this was coming.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a certain geniality] My dear fellow, I don't want to\n      put a pistol to your head. You've had a slack rein so far. I've never\n      objected to your sowing a few wild oats-so long as you  -- er -- [Unseen\n      by SIR WILLIAM, BILL makes a sudden movement] Short of that -- at all\n      events, I've not inquired into your affairs. I can only judge by the -- er -- pecuniary\n      evidence you've been good enough to afford me from time to time. I imagine\n      you've lived like a good many young men in your position -- I'm not\n      blaming you, but there's a time for all things.",
                "BILL. Why don't you say outright that you want me to marry Mabel Lanfarne?",
                "SITS WILLIAM. Well, I do. Girl's a nice one. Good family -- got a\n      little money -- rides well. Isn't she good-looking enough for you, or\n      what?",
                "BILL. Quite, thanks.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I understood from your mother that you and she were on good\n      terms.",
                "BILL. Please don't drag mother into it.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With dangerous politeness] Perhaps you'll be good enough to\n      state your objections.",
                "BILL. Must we go on with this?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I've never asked you to do anything for me before; I expect\n      you to pay attention now. I've no wish to dragoon you into this particular\n      marriage. If you don't care for Miss Lanfarne, marry a girl you're fond\n      of.",
                "BILL. I refuse.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. In that case you know what to look out for. [With a sudden\n      rush of choler] You young.... [He checks himself and stands glaring at\n      BILL, who glares back at him] This means, I suppose, that you've got some\n      entanglement or other.",
                "BILL. Suppose what you like, sir.",
                "SITS WILLIAM. I warn you, if you play the blackguard --  --",
                "BILL. You can't force me like young Dunning.",
                "Hearing the raised voices LADY CHESHIRE has come back from the\n        billiard-room.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Closing the door] What is it?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. You deliberately refuse! Go away, Dorothy.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Resolutely] I haven't seen Bill for two months.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What! [Hesitating] Well -- we must talk it over again.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Come to the billiard-room, both of you! Bill, do finish\n      those letters!",
                "With a deft movement she draws SIR WILLIAM toward the billiard-room, and\n        glances back at BILL before going out, but he has turned to the\n        writing-table. When the door is closed, BILL looks into the\n        drawing-room, them opens the door under the stairs; and backing away\n        towards the writing-table, sits down there, and takes up a pen. FREDA\n        who has evidently been waiting, comes in and stands by the table.",
                "BILL. I say, this is dangerous, you know.",
                "FREDA. Yes -- but I must.",
                "BILL. Well, then -- [With natural recklessness] Aren't you going to\n      kiss me?",
                "Without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry.",
                "BILL. Do you know you haven't seen me for eight weeks?",
                "FREDA. Quite -- long enough -- for you to have forgotten.",
                "BILL. Forgotten! I don't forget people so soon.",
                "FREDA. No?",
                "BILL. What's the matter with you, Freda?",
                "FREDA. [After a long look] It'll never be as it was.",
                "BILL. [Jumping up] How d'you mean?",
                "FREDA. I've got something for you. [She takes a diamond ring out of her\n      dress and holds it out to him] I've not worn it since Cromer.",
                "BILL. Now, look here",
                "FREDA. I've had my holiday; I shan't get another in a hurry.",
                "BILL. Freda!",
                "FREDA. You'll be glad to be free. That fortnight's all you really loved me\n      in.",
                "BILL. [Putting his hands on her arms] I swear --  --",
                "FREDA. [Between her teeth] Miss Lanfarne need never know about me.",

It is a pretty room, with white panelled walls; and\n        chrysanthemums and carmine lilies in bowls. A large bow window overlooks\n        the park under a sou'-westerly sky. A piano stands open; a fire is\n        burning; and the morning's correspondence is scattered on a\n        writing-table. Doors opposite each other lead to the maid's workroom,\n        and to a corridor. LADY CHESHIRE is standing in the middle of the room,\n        looking at an opera cloak, which FREDA is holding out.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Well, Freda, suppose you just give it up!",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. It's all very well to smile. You want bracing up. Now don't\n      be naughty. I shall give you a tonic. And I think you had better put that\n      cloak away.",

                "FREDA. Borrow a real one, Miss Joan. There are some that don't count much.",

                "BILL. Hadn't you better be a little careful?",
                "MABEL. And never to see the hedge until they're stuck in it. And then\n      straight from that hedge into the opposite one.",

                "BILL. No.",
                "MABEL, You always make me feel so Irish. Is it because you're so English,\n      d'you think? Ah! I can see him moving his ears. Now he's pawing the ground -- He's\n      started!",
                "BILL. Miss Lanfarne!",
                "MABEL. [Still backing away from him, and drawing him on with her eyes and\n      smile] You can't help coming after me! [Then with a sudden change to a\n      sort of sierra gravity] Can you? You'll feel that when I've gone.",
                "They stand quite still, looking into each other's eyes and FREDA, who\n        has opened the door of the workroom stares at them.",

                "FREDA. That will be clever.",
                "BILL. I wish to Heaven my affairs weren't in such a mess.",
                "FREDA. I shall be -- all -- right, thank you.",
                "BILL. You must think me a blackguard. [She shakes her head] Abuse me -- say\n      something! Don't look like that!",

                "BILL. Of course I was, I am now. Give me your hands.",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Solemnly] All such marriages end in wretchedness. You\n      haven't a taste or tradition in common. You don't know what marriage is.\n      Day after day, year after year. It's no use being sentimental -- for\n      people brought up as we are to have different manners is worse than to\n      have different souls. Besides, it's poverty. Your father will never\n      forgive you, and I've practically nothing. What can you do? You have no\n      profession. How are you going to stand it; with a woman who -- ? It's\n      the little things.",
                "BILL. I know all that, thanks.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Nobody does till they've been through it. Marriage is hard\n      enough when people are of the same class. [With a sudden movement towards\n      him] Oh! my dear-before it's too late!",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. For heaven's sake, child, don't call me that again,\n      whatever happens. [She walks to the window, and speaks from there] I know\n      well enough how love comes. I don't blame you. Don't cry. But, you see,\n      it's my eldest son. [FREDA puts her hand to her breast] Yes, I know. Women\n      always get the worst of these things. That's natural. But it's not only\n      you is it? Does any one guess?",
                "FREDA. No.",

                "FREDA. He's -- always -- behaved -- like -- a -- gentleman.",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. If men are like gunpowder, Freda, women are not. If you've\n      lost him it's been your own fault.",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Looking down, and speaking rapidly] Listen to me. I love\n      my son, but I know him -- I know all his kind of man. I've lived with\n      one for thirty years. I know the way their senses work. When they want a\n      thing they must have it, and then -- they're sorry.",

                "As LATTER appears from the billiard-room, he goes hurriedly out.",
                "LATTER. Was that Bill?",
                "HAROLD. Yes.",
                "LATTER. Well?",
                "HAROLD. [Pacing up and down in his turn] Rat in a cage is a fool to him.\n      This is the sort of thing you read of in books, John! What price your\n      argument with Runny now? Well, it's not too late for you luckily.",
                "LATTER. What do you mean?",
                "HAROLD. You needn't connect yourself with this eccentric family!",
                "LATTER. I'm not a bounder, Harold.",
                "HAROLD. Good!",
                "LATTER. It's terrible for your sisters.",
                "HAROLD. Deuced lucky we haven't a lot of people staying here! Poor mother!\n      John, I feel awfully bad about this. If something isn't done, pretty mess\n      I shall be in.",
                "LATTER. How?",
                "HAROLD. There's no entail. If the Governor cuts Bill off, it'll all come\n      to me.",
                "LATTER. Oh!",
                "HAROLD. Poor old Bill! I say, the play! Nemesis! What? Moral! Caste don't\n      matter. Got us fairly on the hop.",
                "LATTER. It's too bad of Bill. It really is. He's behaved disgracefully.",
                "HAROLD. [Warningly] Well! There are thousands of fellows who'd never dream\n      of sticking to the girl, considering what it means.",
                "LATTER. Perfectly disgusting!",
                "HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you any human sympathy? Don't you know how\n      these things come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.",
                "LATTER. One doesn't take lighted pipes into strawyards unless one's an\n      idiot, or worse.",
                "HAROLD. H'm! [With a grin] You're not allowed tobacco. In the good old\n      days no one would hive thought anything of this. My great-grandfather --  --",
                "LATTER. Spare me your great-grandfather.",
                "HAROLD. I could tell you of at least a dozen men I know who've been\n      through this same business, and got off scot-free; and now because Bill's\n      going to play the game, it'll smash him up.",
                "LATTER. Why didn't he play the game at the beginning?",
                "HAROLD. I can't stand your sort, John. When a thing like this happens, all\n      you can do is to cry out: Why didn't he -- ? Why didn't she -- ?\n      What's to be done -- that's the point!",
                "LATTER. Of course he'll have to --  -- .",
                "HAROLD. Ha!",
                "LATTER. What do you mean by -- that?",
                "HAROLD. Look here, John! You feel in your bones that a marriage'll be\n      hopeless, just as I do, knowing Bill and the girl and everything! Now\n      don't you?",
                "LATTER. The whole thing is -- is most unfortunate.",
                "HAROLD. By Jove! I should think it was!",
                "As he speaks CHRISTINE and KEITH Come in from the billiard-room. He is\n        still in splashed hunting clothes, and looks exceptionally weathered,\n        thin-lipped, reticent. He lights a cigarette and sinks into an armchair.\n        Behind them DOT and JOAN have come stealing in.",
                "CHRISTINE. I've told Ronny.",
                "JOAN. This waiting for father to be told is awful.",

                "KEITH. Clackenham. He'll be home in ten minutes.",
                "DOT. Mabel's going. [They all stir, as if at fresh consciousness of\n      discomfiture]. She walked into Gracely and sent herself a telegram.",
                "HAROLD. Phew!",
                "DOT. And we shall say good-bye, as if nothing had happened.",

                "DOT. I'm not a squeamy squirrel.",
                "KEITH. Anybody seen the girl since?",
                "DOT. Yes.",
                "HAROLD. Well?",
                "DOT. She's just sitting there.",
                "CHRISTINE. [In a hard voice] As we're all doing.",
                "DOT. She's so soft, that's what's so horrible. If one could only feel --  -- !",
                "KEITH. She's got to face the music like the rest of us.",
                "DOT. Music! Squeaks! Ugh! The whole thing's like a concertina, and some\n      one jigging it!",
                "They all turn as the door opens, and a FOOTMAN enters with a tray of\n        whiskey, gin, lemons, and soda water. In dead silence the FOOTMAN puts\n        the tray down.",
                "HAROLD. [Forcing his voice] Did you get a run, Ronny? [As KEITH nods] What\n      point?",
                "KEITH. Eight mile.",
                "FOOTMAN. Will you take tea, sir?",

                "KEITH. Great Scott! I'm not saying Bill ought to marry her. She's got to\n      stand the racket. But your Dad will have a tough job to take up that\n      position.",
                "DOT. Awfully funny!",
                "CHRISTINE. What on earth d'you mean, Dot?",
                "DOT. Morality in one eye, and your title in the other!",

                "CHRISTINE. But, mother, it's desperate.",
                "DOT. Shut up, Chris! Of course mother can't. We simply couldn't beg her to\n      let us off!",
                "CHRISTINE. There must be some way. What do you think in your heart,\n      mother?",

                "Hypnotised by their private longing for what CHRISTINE has been urging\n        they have all fixed their eyes on LADY CHESHIRE, who looks from, face to\n        face, and moves her hands as if in physical pain.",

                "LADY CHESHIRE suddenly rises, looking towards the billiard-room door,\n        listening. They all follow her eyes. She sits down again, passing her\n        hand over her lips, as SIR WILLIAM enters. His hunting clothes are\n        splashed; his face very grim and set. He walks to the fore without a\n        glance at any one, and stands looking down into it. Very quietly, every\n        one but LADY CHESHIRE steals away.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. What have you done?",

                "LADY CHESHIRE. [In a low voice] Bill, don't be harsh. It's all too\n      terrible.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Sit down, my dear. [She resumes her seat, and he turns back\n        to the fire.]",
                "SIR WILLIAM. In all my life I've never been face to face with a thing like\n      this. [Gripping the mantelpiece so hard that his hands and arms are seen\n      shaking] You ask me to be calm. I am trying to be. Be good enough in turn\n      not to take his part against me.",

                "SIR WILLIAM. I am trying to think. I understand that you've known this -- piece\n      of news since this morning. I've known it ten minutes. Give me a little\n      time, please. [Then, after a silence] Where's the girl?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. In the workroom.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Raising his clenched fist] What in God's name is he about?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. What have you said to him?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Nothing-by a miracle. [He breaks away from the fire and walks\n      up and down] My family goes back to the thirteenth century. Nowadays they\n      laugh at that! I don't! Nowadays they laugh at everything -- they even\n      laugh at the word lady. I married you, and I don't .... Married his\n      mother's maid! By George! Dorothy! I don't know what we've done to deserve\n      this; it's a death blow! I'm not prepared to sit down and wait for it. By\n      Gad! I am not. [With sudden fierceness] There are plenty in these days\n      who'll be glad enough for this to happen; plenty of these d -- -d\n      Socialists and Radicals, who'll laugh their souls out over what they\n      haven't the bowels to sees a -- tragedy. I say it would be a tragedy;\n      for you, and me, and all of us. You and I were brought up, and we've\n      brought the children up, with certain beliefs, and wants, and habits. A\n      man's past -- his traditions -- he can't get rid of them. They're -- they're\n      himself! [Suddenly] It shan't go on.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. What's to prevent it?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I utterly forbid this piece of madness. I'll stop it.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. But the thing we can't stop.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Provision must be made.",

                "SIR WILLIAM. What! [Suddenly perceiving what she is alluding to] You're\n      thinking of young -- young --  -- [Shortly] I don't see the\n      connection.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. What's so awful, is that the boy's trying to do what's\n      loyal -- and we -- his father and mother --  -- !",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I'm not going to see my eldest son ruin his life. I must\n      think this out.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Beneath her breath] I've tried that -- it doesn't help.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. This girl, who was born on the estate, had the run of the\n      house -- brought up with money earned from me -- nothing but\n      kindness from all of us; she's broken the common rules of gratitude and\n      decency -- she lured him on, I haven't a doubt!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [To herself] In a way, I suppose.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What! It's ruin. We've always been here. Who the deuce are we\n      if we leave this place? D'you think we could stay? Go out and meet\n      everybody just as if nothing had happened? Good-bye to any prestige,\n      political, social, or anything! This is the sort of business nothing can\n      get over. I've seen it before. As to that other matter -- it's soon\n      forgotten -- constantly happening -- Why, my own grandfather --  -- !",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Does he help?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Stares before him in silence-suddenly] You must go to the\n      girl. She's soft. She'll never hold out against you.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I did before I knew what was in front of her -- I said\n      all I could. I can't go again now. I can't do it, Bill.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What are you going to do, then -- fold your hands? [Then\n      as LADY CHESHIRE makes a move of distress.] If he marries her, I've done\n      with him. As far as I'm concerned he'll cease to exist. The title -- I\n      can't help. My God! Does that meet your wishes?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [With sudden fire] You've no right to put such an\n      alternative to me. I'd give ten years of my life to prevent this marriage.\n      I'll go to Bill. I'll beg him on my knees.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Then why can't you go to the girl? She deserves no\n      consideration. It's not a question of morality: Morality be d -- -d!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. But not self-respect....",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What! You're his mother!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. I've tried; I [putting her hand to her throat] can't get it\n      out.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Staring at her] You won't go to her? It's the only chance.\n      [LADY CHESHIRE turns away.]",
                "SIR WILLIAM. In the whole course of our married life, Dorothy, I've never\n      known you set yourself up against me. I resent this, I warn you -- I\n      resent it. Send the girl to me. I'll do it myself.",
                "With a look back at him LADY CHESHIRE goes out into the corridor.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. This is a nice end to my day!",
                "He takes a small china cup from of the mantel-piece; it breaks with the\n        pressure of his hand, and falls into the fireplace. While he stands\n        looking at it blankly, there is a knock.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Come in!",
                "FREDA enters from the corridor.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I've asked you to be good enough to come, in order that -- [pointing\n      to chair] -- You may sit down.",
                "But though she advances two or three steps, she does not sit down.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. This is a sad business.",
                "FREDA. [Below her breath] Yes, Sir William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Becoming conscious of the depths of feeling before him] I -- er -- are\n      you attached to my son?",
                "FREDA. [In a whisper] Yes.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. It's very painful to me to have to do this. [He turns away\n      from her and speaks to the fire.] I sent for you -- to -- ask -- \n      [quickly] How old are you?",
                "FREDA. Twenty-two.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [More resolutely] Do you expect me to sanction such a mad\n      idea as a marriage?",
                "FREDA. I don't expect anything.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. You know -- you haven't earned the right to be considered.",
                "FREDA. Not yet!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. What! That oughtn't to help you! On the contrary. Now brace\n      yourself up, and listen to me!",
                "She stands waiting to hear her sentence. SIR WILLIAM looks at her; and\n        his glance gradually wavers.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I've not a word to say for my son. He's behaved like a scamp.",
                "FREDA. Oh! no!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a silencing gesture] At the same, time -- What made\n      you forget yourself? You've no excuse, you know.",
                "FREDA. No.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. You'll deserve all you'll get. Confound it! To expect me to -- It's\n      intolerable! Do you know where my son is?",
                "FREDA. [Faintly] I think he's in the billiard-room with my lady.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With renewed resolution] I wanted to -- to put it to you -- as\n      a -- as a -- what! [Seeing her stand so absolutely motionless,\n      looking at him, he turns abruptly, and opens the billiard-room door] I'll\n      speak to him first. Come in here, please! [To FREDA] Go in, and wait!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE and BILL Come in, and FREDA passing them, goes into the\n        billiard-room to wait.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Speaking with a pause between each sentence] Your mother and\n      I have spoken of this -- calamity. I imagine that even you have some\n      dim perception of the monstrous nature of it. I must tell you this: If you\n      do this mad thing, you fend for yourself. You'll receive nothing from me\n      now or hereafter. I consider that only due to the position our family has\n      always held here. Your brother will take your place. We shall -- get on\n      as best we can without you. [There is a dead silence till he adds sharply]\n      Well!",
                "BILL. I shall marry her.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! Bill! Without love-without anything!",
                "BILL. All right, mother! [To SIR WILLIAM] you've mistaken your man, sir.\n      Because I'm a rotter in one way, I'm not necessarily a rotter in all. You\n      put the butt end of the pistol to Dunning's head yesterday, you put the\n      other end to mine to-day. Well! [He turns round to go out] Let the d -- -d\n      thing off!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Bill!",
                "BILL. [Turning to her] I'm not going to leave her in the lurch.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Do me the justice to admit that I have not attempted to\n      persuade you to.",
                "BILL. No! you've chucked me out. I don't see what else you could have done\n      under the circumstances. It's quite all right. But if you wanted me to\n      throw her over, father, you went the wrong way to work, that's all;\n      neither you nor I are very good at seeing consequences.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Do you realise your position?",
                "BILK. [Grimly] I've a fair notion of it.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a sudden outburst] You have none -- not the\n      faintest, brought up as you've been.",
                "BILL. I didn't bring myself up.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With a movement of uncontrolled anger, to which his son\n      responds] You -- ungrateful young dog!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. How can you -- both? [They drop their eyes, and stand\n      silent.]",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [With grimly suppressed emotion] I am speaking under the\n      stress of very great pain -- some consideration is due to me. This is a\n      disaster which I never expected to have to face. It is a matter which I\n      naturally can never hope to forget. I shall carry this down to my death.\n      We shall all of us do that. I have had the misfortune all my life to\n      believe in our position here -- to believe that we counted for\n      something -- that the country wanted us. I have tried to do my duty by\n      that position. I find in one moment that it is gone --  smoke -- gone.\n      My philosophy is not equal to that. To countenance this marriage would be\n      unnatural.",
                "BILL. I know. I'm sorry. I've got her into this -- I don't see any\n      other way out. It's a bad business for me, father, as well as for you --  --",
                "He stops, seeing that JACKSON has route in, and is standing there\n        waiting.",
                "JACKSON. Will you speak to Studdenham, Sir William? It's about young\n      Dunning.",
                "After a moment of dead silence, SIR WILLIAM nods, and the butler\n        withdraws.",
                "BILL. [Stolidly] He'd better be told.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. He shall be.",
                "STUDDENHAM enters, and touches his forehead to them all with a\n        comprehensive gesture.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Good evenin', my lady! Evenin', Sir William!",
                "STUDDENHAM. Glad to be able to tell you, the young man's to do the proper\n      thing. Asked me to let you know, Sir William. Banns'll be up next Sunday.\n      [Struck by the silence, he looks round at all three in turn, and suddenly\n      seeing that LADY CHESHIRE is shivering] Beg pardon, my lady, you're\n      shakin' like a leaf!",
                "BILL. [Blurting it out] I've a painful piece of news for you, Studdenham;\n      I'm engaged to your daughter. We're to be married at once.",
                "STUDDENHAM. I -- don't -- understand you -- sir.",
                "BILL. The fact is, I've behaved badly; but I mean to put it straight.",
                "STUDDENHAM. I'm a little deaf. Did you say -- my daughter?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. There's no use mincing matters, Studdenham. It's a\n      thunderbolt -- young Dunning's case over again.",
                "STUDDENHAM. I don't rightly follow. She's -- You've -- ! I must see\n      my daughter. Have the goodness to send for her, m'lady.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE goes to the billiard-room, and calls: \"FREDA, come here,\n        please.\"",
                "STUDDENHAM. [TO SIR WILLIAM] YOU tell me that my daughter's in the\n      position of that girl owing to your son? Men ha' been shot for less.",
                "BILL. If you like to have a pot at me, Studdenham you're welcome.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Averting his eyes from BILL at the sheer idiocy of this\n      sequel to his words] I've been in your service five and twenty years, Sir\n      William; but this is man to man -- this is!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I don't deny that, Studdenham.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [With eyes shifting in sheer anger] No -- 'twouldn't be\n      very easy. Did I understand him to say that he offers her marriage?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. You did.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Into his beard] Well -- that's something! [Moving his\n      hands as if wringing the neck of a bird] I'm tryin' to see the rights o'\n      this.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. [Bitterly] You've all your work cut out for you, Studdenham.",
                "Again STUDDENHAM makes the unconscious wringing movement with his hands.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Turning from it with a sort of horror] Don't, Studdenham!\n      Please!",
                "STUDDENHAM. What's that, m'lady?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. [Under her breath] Your -- your -- hands.",
                "While STUDDENHAM is still staring at her, FREDA is seen standing in the\n        doorway, like a black ghost.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Come here! You! [FREDA moves a few steps towards her father]\n      When did you start this?",
                "FREDA. [Almost inaudibly] In the summer, father.",
                "LADY CHESHIRE. Don't be harsh to her!",
                "STUDDENHAM. Harsh! [His eyes again move from side to side as if pain and\n      anger had bewildered them. Then looking sideways at FREDA, but in a\n      gentler voice] And when did you tell him about -- what's come to you?",
                "FREDA. Last night.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Oh! [With sudden menace] You young -- ! [He makes a\n      convulsive movement of one hand; then, in the silence, seems to lose grip\n      of his thoughts, and pits his hand up to his head] I want to clear me mind\n      a bit -- I don't see it plain at all. [Without looking at BILL] 'Tis\n      said there's been an offer of marriage?",
                "BILL. I've made it, I stick to it.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Oh! [With slow, puzzled anger] I want time to get the pith o'\n      this. You don't say anything, Sir William?",
                "SIR WILLIAM. The facts are all before you.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Scarcely moving his lips] M'lady?",
                "LADY CHESHIRE is silent.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Stammering] My girl was -- was good enough for any man.\n      It's not for him that's -- that's to look down on her. [To FREDA] You\n      hear the handsome offer that's been made you? Well? [FREDA moistens her\n      lips and tries to speak, but cannot] If nobody's to speak a word, we won't\n      get much forrarder. I'd like for you to say what's in your mind, Sir\n      William.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I -- If my son marries her he'll have to make his own way.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Savagely] I'm not puttin' thought to that.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. I didn't suppose you were, Studdenham. It appears to rest\n      with your daughter. [He suddenly takes out his handkerchief, and puts it\n      to his forehead] Infernal fires they make up here!",
                "LADY CHESHIRE, who is again shivering desperately, as if with intense\n      cold, makes a violent attempt to control her shuddering.",
                "STUDDENHAM. [Suddenly] There's luxuries that's got to be paid for. [To\n      FREDA] Speak up, now.",
                "FREDA turns slowly and looks up at SIR WILLIAM; he involuntarily raises\n        his hand to his mouth. Her eyes travel on to LADY CHESHIRE, who faces\n        her, but so deadly pale that she looks as if she were going to faint.\n        The girl's gaze passes on to BILL, standing rigid, with his jaw set.",
                "FREDA. I want -- [Then flinging her arm up over her eyes, she turns\n      from him] No!",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Ah!",
                "At that sound of profound relief, STUDDENHAM, whose eyes have been\n        following his daughter's, moves towards SIR WILLIAM, all his emotion\n        turned into sheer angry pride.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Don't be afraid, Sir William! We want none of you! She'll not\n      force herself where she's not welcome. She may ha' slipped her good name,\n      but she'll keep her proper pride. I'll have no charity marriage in my\n      family.",
                "SIR WILLIAM. Steady, Studdenham!",
                "STUDDENHAM. If the young gentleman has tired of her in three months, as a\n      blind man can see by the looks of him -- she's not for him!",
                "BILL. [Stepping forward] I'm ready to make it up to her.",
                "STUDDENHAM. Keep back, there? [He takes hold of FREDA, and looks around\n      him] Well! She's not the first this has happened to since the world began,\n      an' she won't be the last. Come away, now, come away!",
                "Taking FREDA by the shoulders, he guides her towards the door.",

BILL, following FREDA and STUDDENHAM, has stopped\n        at the shut door. LADY CHESHIRE moves swiftly close to him. The door of\n        the billiard-room is opened, and DOT appears. With a glance round, she\n        crosses quickly to her mother.",

DOT clasps her hands together, and standing there in the\n        middle of the room, looks from her brother to her father, from her\n        father to her brother.
