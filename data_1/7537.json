                "In the autumn of 1888 a Danish magazine published a few chapters of an\nautobiographical novel which instantly created the greatest stir in\nliterary circles throughout Europe. At that time Ibsen, Bj\u00f6rnson, Brandes,\nStrindberg, and other Scandinavian writers were at the height of their\ncosmopolitan fame, and it was only natural that the reading world should\nkeep in close touch with the literary production of the North. But even\nthe professional star-gazers, who maintained a vigilant watch on northern\nskies, had never come across the name of Knut Hamsun. He was unknown;\nwhatever slight attention his earlier struggles for recognition may have\nattracted was long ago forgotten. And now he blazed forth overnight, with\nmeteoric suddenness, with a strange, fantastic, intense brilliance which\ncould only emanate from a star of the first magnitude.\n",
                "Sudden as was Hamsun's recognition, however, it has proved lasting. The\nstory of his rise from obscurity to fame is one of absorbing interest.\nBehind that hour of triumph lay a long and bitter struggle, weary years of\nstriving, of constant and courageous battle with a destiny that strewed\nhis path with disappointments and defeats, overwhelming him with\nadversities that would have swamped a genius of less energy and real\npower.\n",
                "Knut Hamsun began life in one of the deep Norwegian valleys familiar to\nEnglish readers through Bj\u00f6rnson's earlier stories. He was born in August,\n1860. When he was four years old his poverty-stricken parents sent him to\nan uncle, a stern, unlovely man who made his home on one of the Lofoten\nIslands--that \"Drama in Granite\" which Norway's rugged coast-line flings\nfar into the Arctic night. Here he grew up, a taciturn, peculiar lad,\ninured to hardship and danger, in close communion with nature; dreaming\nthrough the endless northern twilight, revelling through the brief intense\nsummer, surrounded by influences and by an atmosphere which later were to\ngive to his production its strange, mystical colouring, its\npendulum-swings from extreme to extreme.\n",
                "At seventeen he was apprenticed to a cobbler, and while working at his\ntrade he wrote and, at the cost of no one knows what sacrifices, saved\nenough money to have his first literary efforts printed and published.\nThey consisted of a long, fantastic poem and a novel, \"Bj\u00f6rger\"--the\nlatter a grotesque conglomeration of intense self-analytical studies.\nThese attracted far less attention than they really deserved. However, the\ncobbler's bench saw no more of Knut Hamsun.\n",
                "During the next twelve years he led the life of a rover, but a rover with\na fixed purpose from which he never swerved. First he turned his face\ntoward Christiania, the capital and the intellectual centre of the\ncountry; and in order to get there he worked at anything that offered\nitself. He was a longshoreman on Bod\u00f6's docks, a road-labourer, a\nlumberjack in the mountains; a private tutor and court messenger. Finally\nhe reached the metropolis and enrolled as a student at the university. But\nthe gaunt, raw-boned youth, unpractical and improvident, overbearing of\nmanner, passionately independent in thought and conduct, failed utterly in\nhis attempts to realise whatever ambitions he had cherished. So it was\nhardly strange that this the first chapter of his Odyssey should end in\nthe steerage of an American-bound emigrant steamer.\n",
                "In America, where he landed penniless, he turned his strong and capable\nhands to whatever labour he could find. He had intended to become a\nUnitarian minister. Instead of doing so he had to work as a farm-hand on\nthe prairie, street-car conductor in Chicago, dairyman in Dakota; and he\nvaried these pursuits by giving a series of lectures on French literature\nin Minneapolis. By that time he probably imagined that he was equipped for\na more successful attack on the literary strongholds of his own country,\nand returned to Christiania. Disappointments and privations followed more\nbitter than any he had ever known. He starved and studied and dreamed;\nvainly he made the most desperate attempts to gain recognition. In despair\nhe once more abandoned the battle-field and fled to America again, with\nthe avowed purpose of gaining a reputation on the lecture platform.\n",
                "Once more he failed; his countrymen resident in the Northwest would have\nnone of him. Beaten back in every attempt, discouraged, perhaps feeling\nthe need of solitude and the opportunities for introspective thought which\nhe could not find in the larger cities, he exiled himself to that most\ndesolate of existences, a life on a Newfoundland fishing-smack. Three long\nyears he spent as one of a rude crew with whom he could have nothing in\ncommon save the daily death-struggle with the elements. But these years\nfinished the preparatory stage of Hamsun's education. During the solitary\nwatches he matured as an artist and as a man. In his very first effort\nupon his return to civilisation he proved that the days of aimless\nfumblings were over: in \"Hunger\" he stands suddenly revealed as a master\nof style and description, a bold and independent thinker, a penetrating,\nkeen psychologist, a realist of marked virility.\n",
                "Since \"Hunger\" was written Hamsun has published over thirty large works--\nnovels, dramas, travel descriptions, essays, and poems. Every one of them\nis of a high order. Each is unlike the rest; but through them all flash in\nvivid gleams a dazzling witchery of style, a bewildering originality, a\npassionate nature-worship, and an imagination which at times takes away\nthe breath.\n",
                "\"Shallow Soil,\" in some respects the most contained of Hamsun's works, is\nperhaps best suited as a medium for his introduction to Anglo-Saxon\nreaders. In a very complete analysis of Hamsun's authorship the German\nliterary critic, Professor Carl Morburger, thus refers to \"Shallow Soil\":\n",
                "\"Not only is this book Knut Hamsun's most significant work, but it gives\nthe very best description available of life in Christiania toward the\nclose of the century. A book of exquisite lyric beauty, of masterly\npsychology, and finished artistic form, it is so rich in idea and life\nthat one must refrain from touching on the contents in order to keep\nwithin the narrow limits of this essay. A most superbly delicate\ndelineation of the feminine soul is here given in the drawing of Hanka and\nAagot; nowhere else is woman's love in its dawn and growth described with\nsuch mastery, with a deftness and sureness of touch which reminds one of\nthe very greatest passages in that Danish classic, 'Niels Lyhne.'\"\n",
                "Hamsun is now in his fifty-fourth year. The expectations aroused by his\nfirst book have been more than fulfilled; the star that was born overnight\nstill shines with undimmed brilliance--nay, with a purer, warmer, steadier\nflame. The volcanic violence of earlier days has been mellowed and\nsubdued; the \"red eruptions of flame-tongued, primeval power\" have all but\nceased. In one of his latest works Hamsun himself notes this change in\nsaying: \"When a wanderer reaches fifty years he plays with muted strings.\"\nBut with or without the sordine Hamsun's production is equally seductive,\nequally entrancing and compelling. All over the continent of Europe he is\nknown and his writings treasured; in Russia his popularity exceeds that of\nmany of its own inimitable writers. It is to be expected that the\nEnglish-speaking world will accord him that appreciation which is the\nnatural tribute to genius, irrespective of language or clime.\n",

                "A faint, golden, metallic rim appears in the east where the sun is rising.\nThe city is beginning to stir; already can be heard an occasional distant\nrumble of trucks rolling into the streets from the country, large\nfarm-wagons heavily loaded with supplies for the markets--with hay and\nmeat and cordwood. And these wagons make more noise than usual because the\npavements are still brittle from nightly frosts. It is the latter part of\nMarch.\n",
                "Everything is quiet around the harbour. Here and there a sleepy sailor\ntumbles out of a forecastle; smoke is curling from the galleys. A skipper\nputs his head out of a companionway and sniffs toward the weather; the sea\nstretches in undisturbed calm; all the winches are at rest.\n",
                "The first wharf gate is thrown open. Through it one catches a glimpse of\nsacks and cases piled high, of cans and barrels; men with ropes and\nwheelbarrows are moving around, still half asleep, yawning openly with\nangular, bearded jaws. And barges are warped in alongside the docks;\nanother army begins the hoisting and stowing of goods, the loading of\nwagons, and the moving of freight.\n",
                "In the streets one door after another is opened; blinds are raised,\noffice-boys are sweeping floors and dusting counters. In the H. Henriksen\noffice the son is sitting at a desk, all alone; he is sorting mail. A\nyoung gentleman is strolling, tired and sleepy, toward the railway square;\nhe comes from a late party given in some comrade's den and is taking the\nmorning air. At Fire Headquarters he runs across an acquaintance who has\nalso been celebrating.\n",
                "\"Abroad so early, Ojen?\" asks the first stroller.\n",
                "\"Yes--that is to say, I haven't been in bed yet!\"\n",
                "\"Neither have I,\" laughs the first. \"Good night!\"\n",
                "And he wanders on, smiling in amusement over that good night on a bright\nand sunny morning. He is a young and promising man; his name had suddenly\nbecome famous two years ago when he published a lyric drama. His name is\nIrgens; everybody knows him. He wears patent-leather shoes and is\ngood-looking, with his curled moustache and his sleek, dark hair.\n",
                "He drifts from one market square to another; it amuses him, sleepy as he\nis, to watch the farmers who are invading the public squares with their\ntrucks. The spring sun has browned their faces; they wear heavy mufflers\naround their necks, and their hands are sinewy and dirty. They are in such\na hurry to sell their wares that they even hail him, a youth of\ntwenty-four without a family, a lyric writer who is simply loitering at\nrandom in order to divert himself.\n",
                "The sun climbs higher. Now people begin to swarm in all directions; shrill\nwhistles are heard, now from the factories in the city suburbs, now from\nthe railway stations and docks; the traffic increases. Busy workers dart\nhither and thither--some munching their breakfast from newspaper parcels.\nA man pushes an enormous load of bundles on a push-cart, he is delivering\ngroceries; he strains like a horse and reads addresses from a note-book as\nhe hurries along. A child is distributing morning papers; she is a little\ngirl who has Saint Vitus's dance; she jerks her angular body in all\ndirections, twitches her shoulders, blinks, hustles from door to door,\nclimbs the stairs in the high-storied houses, presses bells, and hurries\non, leaving papers on every doorstep. A dog follows her and makes every\ntrip with her.\n",
                "Traffic and noise increase and spread; beginning at the factories, the\nwharves, the shipyards, and the sawmills, they mingle with wagon rumblings\nand human voices; the air is rent by steam-whistles whose agonising wails\nrise skyward, meeting and blending above the large squares in a booming\ndiapason, a deep-throated, throbbing roar that enwraps the entire city.\nTelegraph messengers dart hither and yon, scattering orders and quotations\nfrom distant markets. The powerful, vitalising chant of commerce booms\nthrough the air; the wheat in India, the coffee in Java promise well; the\nSpanish markets are crying for fish--enormous quantities of fish during\nLent.\n",
                "It is eight o'clock; Irgens starts for home. He passes H. Henriksen's\nestablishment and decides to drop in a moment. The son of the house, a\nyoung man in a business suit of cheviot, is still busy at his desk. His\neyes are large and blue, although his complexion is rather dark otherwise;\na stray wisp of hair sags untidily over his forehead. The tall, somewhat\ngaunt and taciturn fellow looks about thirty years old. His comrades value\nhim highly because he helps them a good deal with money and articles of\ncommerce from the firm's cellars.\n",
                "\"Good morning!\" calls Irgens.\n",
                "The other looks up in surprise.\n",
                "\"What--you? Are you abroad so early?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. That is to say, I haven't been to bed yet.\"\n",
                "\"Oh--that's different. I have been at my desk since five; I have cabled to\nthree countries already.\"\n",
                "\"Good Lord--you know I am not the least interested in your trading! There\nis only one thing I want to discuss with you, Ole Henriksen; have you got\na drink of brandy?\"\n",
                "The two men leave the office and pass through the store down into the\ncellar. Ole Henriksen pulls a cork hurriedly; his father is expected any\nmoment, and for this reason he is in haste. The father is old, but that is\nno reason why he should be ignored.\n",
                "Irgens drinks and says: \"Can I take the bottle along?\" And Ole Henriksen\nnods.\n",
                "On their way back through the store he pulls out a drawer from the\ncounter, and Irgens, who understands the hint, takes something from the\ndrawer which he puts in his mouth. It is coffee, roasted coffee; good for\nthe breath.\n"

They chat and laugh\nin all manner of voices, greet each other, smile, nod, turn around, shout.\nCigar smoke and ladies' veils flutter in the air; a kaleidoscopic\nconfusion of light gloves and handkerchiefs, of bobbing hats and swinging\ncanes, glides down the street along which carriages drive with ladies and\ngentlemen in stylish attire.\n",
                "Several young gentlemen have taken their accustomed stand at \"The Corner.\"\nThey form a circle of acquaintances--a couple of artists, a couple of\nauthors, a business man, an undefinable--comrades all. They are dressed\nvariously: some have already dispensed with their overcoats, others wear\nlong ulsters with turned-up collars as in midwinter. Everybody knows \"the\nclique.\"\n",
                "Some join it while others depart; there remain a young, corpulent artist\nby the name of Milde, and an actor with a snub nose and a creamy voice;\nalso Irgens, and Attorney Grande of the prominent Grande family. The most\nimportant, however, is Paulsberg, Lars Paulsberg, the author of half a\ndozen novels and a scientific work on the Atonement. He is loudly referred\nto as the Poet, even though both Irgens and Ojen are present.\n",

                "\"The contrary here!\" exclaims the Attorney. \"I could shout all the time; I\nam neighing inwardly; my blood sings a hunting chorus!\" And the little\nstooping youth straightens his shoulders and glances secretly at\nPaulsberg.\n",
                "\"Listen to that!\" says the Actor sarcastically. \"A man is a man, as the\neunuch said.\"\n",

                "They spoke with practised ease about everything, had perfect control over\ntheir words, made quick sallies, and were skilled in repartee.\n",
                "A number of cadets were passing.\n",
                "\"Did you ever see anything as flabby as these military youths!\" said\nIrgens. \"Look at them; they do not walk past like other mortals, they\n_stalk_ past!\"\n",
                "Both Irgens and the Artist laughed at this, but the Attorney glanced\nquickly at Paulsberg, whose face remained immovable. Paulsberg made a few\nremarks about the Art Exhibition and was silent.\n",
                "The conversation drifted to yesterday's performance in Tivoli, and from\nthere to political subjects. Of course, they could refuse to pass all\nfinancial bills, but--And perhaps there was not even a sufficient\nmajority to defeat the government budget. It certainly looked dubious--\nrotten--They cited quotations from leading parliamentarians, they proposed\nto put the torch to the Castle and proclaim the republic without delay.\nThe Artist threatened a general revolt of the labouring classes. \"Do you\nknow what the Speaker told me in confidence? That he never, _never_\nwould agree to a compromise--rather let the Union sink or swim! 'Sink or\nswim,' these were his very words. And when one knows the Speaker--\"\n",
                "Still Paulsberg did not say anything, and as the comrades were eager to\nhear his opinion, the Attorney finally ventured to address him:\n",
                "\"And you, Paulsberg, you don't say a word?\"\n",
                "Paulsberg very seldom spoke; he had kept to himself and to his studies and\nhis literary tasks, and lacked the verbal facility of his comrades. He\nsmiled good-naturedly and answered:\n",
                "\"'Let your communication be Yea, yea, and Nay, nay,' you know!\" At this\nthey all laughed loudly. \"But otherwise,\" he added, \"apart from that I am\nseriously considering going home to my wife.\"\n",
                "And Paulsberg went. It was his wont to go when he said he would.\n",
                "But after Paulsberg's departure it seemed as if they might as well all go;\nthere was no reason to remain now. The Actor saluted and disappeared; he\nhurried off in order to catch up with Paulsberg. The Painter threw his\nulster around himself without buttoning it, drew up his shoulders, and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"I feel rotten! If a fellow could only afford a little dinner!\"\n",
                "\"You must try and strike a huckster,\" said Irgens. \"I struck one for a\nbrandy this morning.\"\n",
                "\"I am wondering what Paulsberg really meant by that remark,\" said the\nAttorney. \"'Your communication shall be Yea, yea, and Nay, nay'; it is\nevident it had a deeper meaning.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, very evident,\" said Milde. \"Did you notice, he laughed when he said\nit; something must have amused him.\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "A crowd of promenaders were sauntering continually up and down the street,\nback and forth, laughing and talking.\n",

                "\"I have often wished that we had just one more head like Paulsberg's here\nin Norway.\"\n",
                "\"And why, pray?\" asked Irgens stiffly.\n",
                "Milde stared at him, stared at the Attorney, and burst into a surprised\nlaugh.\n",
                "\"Listen to that, Grande! He asks why we need another head like Paulsberg's\nin this country!\"\n",
                "\"I do,\" said Irgens.\n",
                "But Grande did not laugh either, and Milde was unable to understand why\nhis words failed to provoke mirth. He decided to pass it off; he began to\nspeak about other things.\n",
                "\"You said you struck a huckster for brandy; you have got brandy, then?\"\n",
                "\"As for me, I place Paulsberg so high that I consider him _alone_\nable to do what is needed,\" said Irgens with thinly veiled sarcasm.\n",
                "This took Milde by surprise; he was not prepared to contradict Irgens; he\nnodded and said:\n",
                "\"Certainly--exactly. I only thought it might accelerate matters to have a\nlittle assistance, so to speak--a brother in arms. But of course I agree\nwith you.\"\n",

                "Irgens replied with a shrug of the shoulders which might mean anything.\n",
                "\"And they never consider that they are being imposed upon,\" continued\nMilde. \"On the contrary, they think they are highly favoured; it flatters\nthem. Treat them familiarly, drink their health, that is sufficient. Ha,\nha, ha! Isn't it true?\"\n",

                "Of course, they had almost forgotten about that. Certainly, Ojen was going\naway; something had to be done.\n",
                "The situation was this: Ojen had written two novels which had been\ntranslated into German; now his nerves were bothering him; he could not be\nallowed to kill himself with work--something had to be done to procure him\na highly needed rest. He had applied for a government subsidy and had\nevery expectation of receiving it; Paulsberg himself had recommended him,\neven if a little tepidly. The comrades had therefore united in an effort\nto get him to Torahus, to a little mountain resort where the air was\nsplendid for neurasthenics. Ojen was to go in about a week; the money had\nbeen raised; both Ole Henriksen and Tidemand had been exceedingly\ngenerous. It now only remained to arrange a little celebration to speed\nthe parting comrade.\n",
                "\"But where shall we find a battle-ground?\" asked Milde. \"At your house,\nGrande? You have plenty of room?\"\n",
                "Grande was not unwilling; it might be arranged; he would speak to his wife\nabout it. For Grande was married to Mrs. Liberia, and Mrs. Liberia simply\nhad to be consulted. It was agreed to invite Paulsberg and his wife; as\ncontributors Mr. and Mrs. Tidemand and Ole Henriksen were coming as a\nmatter of course. That was settled.\n",
                "\"Ask whom you like, but I refuse to open my doors to that fellow Norem,\"\nsaid the Attorney. \"He always gets drunk and sentimental; he is an awful\nbore. My wife wouldn't stand for him.\"\n",
                "Then the affair could not be held at Grande's house. It would never do to\nslight Norem. In the perplexity Milde offered his studio.\n",
                "The friends considered. It was not a bad idea; a better place would be\nhard to find. The studio was big and roomy as a barn, with two cosy\nadjoining rooms. Milde's studio, then--settled.\n",
                "The affair was coming off in a few days.\n",
                "The four gentlemen stopped at Irgens's place, drank his brandy, and went\nout again. The Attorney was going home; this decision about the studio did\nnot suit him; he felt slighted. He might decide to stay away altogether.\nAt any rate, he said good-bye now and went his own way.\n",
                "\"What about you, Irgens--I hope you will join us?\"\n",
                "Irgens did not say no; he did not at all refuse this invitation. To tell\nthe truth, he was not unduly eager to return to the Grand; this fat artist\nvexed him considerably with his familiar manners. However, he might be\nable to get away immediately after the dinner was over.\n",
                "In this desire Tidemand himself unconsciously assisted him; he left as\nsoon as he had paid the check. He was going somewhere.\n"

He liked to\nring whenever he wanted anything; he preferred his meals served at all\nhours, whenever he took a notion, no matter if it happened to be meal-time\nor not. And Tidemand went into details: he could not bear to have his wife\nserve him his soup, for instance--was it possible for a woman, even with\nthe best intention in the world, to divine how much soup he might want?\n",
                "And, on the other side, there was Mrs. Hanka, an artistic nature, two and\ntwenty, fond of life and audacious as a boy. Mrs. Hanka was greatly gifted\nand warmly interested in many things; she was a welcome guest wherever the\nyouthful assembled, whether in homes or bachelor dens; nobody could resist\nher. No, she did not greatly care for home life or house drudgery. She\ncould not help that; unfortunately she had not inherited these tastes. And\nthis unbearable blessing, of a child every year two years running, drove\nher almost to distraction. Good Lord! she was only a child herself, full\nof life and frivolity; her youth was ahead of her. But pursuant to the\narrangement the couple had made last year, Mrs. Hanka now found it\nunnecessary to place any restraint upon herself....\n",
                "Tidemand entered the warehouse. A cool and tart smell of tropical\nproducts, of coffee and oils and wines, filled the atmosphere. Tall piles\nof tea-boxes, bundles of cinnamon sewn in bast, fruits, rice, spices,\nmountains of flour-sacks--everything had its designated place, from floor\nto roof. In one of the corners a stairway led to the cellar, where\nvenerable hogsheads of wine with copper bands could be glimpsed in the\nhalf-light and where enormous metal tanks rested in massive repose.\n",
                "Tidemand nodded to the busy warehousemen, walked across the floor, and\npeeped through the pane into the little office. Ole was there. He was\nrevising an account on a slate.\n",
                "Ole put the slate down immediately and rose to meet his friend.\n",
                "These two men had known each other since childhood, had gone through the\nbusiness college together, and shared with each other their happiest\nmoments. Even now, when they were competitors, they continued to visit\neach other as often as their work would permit. They did not envy each\nother; the business spirit had made them broad-minded and generous; they\ntoyed with ship-loads, dealt in large amounts, had daily before their eyes\nenormous successes or imposing ruin.\n",
                "Once Tidemand had expressed admiration for a little yacht which Ole\nHenriksen owned. It was two years ago, when it was known that the Tidemand\nfirm had suffered heavy losses in a fish exportation. The yacht lay\nanchored just outside the Henriksen warehouse and attracted much attention\nbecause of its beautiful lines. The masthead was gilded.\n",
                "Tidemand said:\n",
                "\"This is the most beautiful little dream I have ever seen, upon my word!\"\n",
                "Ole Henriksen answered modestly:\n",
                "\"I do not suppose I could get a thousand for her if I were to sell her.\"\n",
                "\"I'll give you a thousand,\" offered Tidemand.\n",
                "Pause. Ole smiled.\n",
                "\"Cash?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"Yes; I happen to have it with me.\"\n",
                "And Tidemand took out his pocketbook and paid over the money.\n",
                "This occurred in the warehouse. The clerks laughed, whispered, and\nwondered.\n",
                "A few days later Ole went over to Tidemand's office and said:\n",
                "\"I don't suppose you would take two thousand for the yacht?\"\n",
                "\"Have you got the money with you?\"\n",
                "\"Yes; it just happens that I have.\"\n",
                "\"All right,\" said Tidemand.\n",
                "And the yacht was Ole's once more....\n",
                "Tidemand had called on Ole now in order to pass away an hour or so. The\ntwo friends were no longer children; they treated each other with the\ngreatest courtesy and were sincerely fond of each other.\n",
                "Ole got hold of Tidemand's hat and cane, which he put away, at the same\ntime pointing his friend to a seat on the little sofa.\n",
                "\"What may I offer you?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"Thanks--nothing,\" said Tidemand. \"I have just had my dinner at the\nGrand.\"\n",
                "Ole placed the flat box with Havanas before him and asked again:\n",
                "\"A little glass? An 1812?\"\n",
                "\"Well, thank you, yes. But never mind; it is too much trouble; you have to\ngo down-stairs for it.\"\n",
                "\"Nonsense; no trouble at all!\"\n",
                "Ole brought the bottle from the cellar; it was impossible to tell what it\nwas; the bottle appeared to be made of some coarse cloth, so deeply\ncovered with dust was it. The wine was chilled and sparkling, it beaded in\nthe glass, and Ole said:\n",
                "\"Here you are; drink hearty, Andreas!\"\n",
                "They drank. A pause ensued.\n",
                "\"I have really come to congratulate you,\" said Tidemand. \"I have never yet\nmade a stroke like that last one of yours!\"\n",
                "It was true that Ole had turned a trick lately. But he insisted that there\nreally was nothing in it that entitled him to any credit; it was just a\nbit of luck. And if there was any credit to bestow, then it belonged to\nthe firm, not to him. The operations in London had succeeded because of\nthe cleverness of his agent.\n",
                "The affair was as follows:\n",
                "An English freight-steamer, the _Concordia_, had left Rio with half a\ncargo of coffee; she touched at Bathurst for a deck-load of hides, ran\ninto the December gales on the north coast of Normandy, and sprung a leak;\nthen she was towed into Plymouth. The cargo was water-soaked; half of it\nwas coffee.\n",
                "This cargo of damaged coffee was washed out and brought to London; it was\nput on the market, but could not be sold; the combination of sea-water and\nhides had spoiled it. The owner tried all sorts of doctorings: he used\ncolouring matter--indigo, kurkuma, chrome, copper vitriol--he had it\nrolled in hogsheads with leaden bullets. Nothing availed; he had to sell\nit at auction. Henriksen's agent bid it in for a song.\n",
                "Ole went to London; he made tests with this coffee, washed out the\ncolouring matter, flushed it thoroughly, and dried it again. Finally he\nhad the entire cargo roasted and packed in hermetically sealed zinc boxes.\nThese boxes were brought to Norway after a month of storing; they were\nunloaded, taken to the warehouse, opened, and sold. The coffee was as good\nas ever. The firm made a barrel of money out of this enterprise.\n",
                "Tidemand said:\n",
                "\"I only learned the particulars a couple of days ago; I must confess that\nI was proud of you!\"\n",
                "\"My part of the business was simply the idea of roasting the coffee--\nmaking it sweat out the damage, so to speak. But otherwise, really--\"\n",
                "\"I suppose you were a little anxious until you knew the result?\"\n",
                "\"Yes; I must admit I was a little anxious.\"\n",
                "\"But what did your father say?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, he did not know anything until it was all over. I was afraid to tell\nhim; he might have disinherited me, cast me off, you know. Ha, ha!\"\n",
                "Tidemand looked at him.\n",
                "\"Hm. This is all very well, Ole. But if you want to give your father, the\nfirm, half the credit, then you should not at the same time tell me that\nyour father knew nothing until it was all over. I have you there!\"\n",
                "A clerk entered with another account on a slate; he bowed, placed the\nslate on the desk, and retired. The telephone rang.\n",
                "\"One moment, Andreas; it is probably only an order. Hello!\"\n",
                "Ole took down the order, rang for a clerk, and gave it to him..\n",
                "\"I am detaining you,\" said Tidemand. \"Let me take one of the slates; there\nis one for each now!\"\n",
                "\"Not much!\" said Ole; \"do you think I will let you work when you come to\nsee me?\"\n",
                "But Tidemand was already busy. He was thoroughly familiar with these\nstrange marks and figures in the many columns, and made out the account on\na sheet of paper. They stood at the desk opposite each other and worked,\nwith an occasional bantering remark.\n",
                "\"Don't let us forget the glasses altogether!\"\n",
                "\"No; you are right!\"\n",
                "\"This is the most enjoyable day I have had in a long time,\" said Ole.\n",
                "\"Do you think so? I was just going to say the same. I have just left the\nGrand--By the way, I have an invitation for you; we are both going to the\nfarewell celebration for Ojen--quite a number will be there.\"\n",
                "\"Is that so? Where is it going to be?\"\n",
                "\"In Milde's studio. You are going, I hope?\"\n",
                "\"Yes; I will be there.\"\n",
                "They went back to their accounts.\n",
                "\"Lord! do you remember the old times when we sat on the school bench\ntogether?\" said Tidemand. \"None of us sported a beard then. It seems as if\nit were only a couple of months ago, I remember it so distinctly.\"\n",
                "Ole put down his pen. The accounts were finished.\n",
                "\"I should like to speak to you about something--you mustn't be offended,\nAndreas--No; take another glass, old fellow, do! I'll get another bottle;\nthis wine is really not fit for company.\"\n",
                "And he hurried out; he looked quite confused.\n",
                "\"What is the matter with him?\" thought Tidemand.\n",
                "Ole returned with another bottle, downy as velvet, with trailing cobwebs;\nhe pulled the cork.\n",
                "\"I don't know how you'll like this,\" he said, and sniffed the glass. \"Try\nit, anyhow; it is really--I am sure you'll like it; I have forgotten the\nvintage, but it is ancient.\"\n",
                "Tidemand sniffed, sipped, put down his glass, and looked at Ole.\n",
                "\"It isn't half bad, is it?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" said Tidemand, \"it is not. You should not have done this, Ole.\"\n",
                "\"Ho! don't be silly--a bottle of wine!\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"I thought you wanted to speak to me about something,\" asked Tidemand.\n",
                "\"Yes, well--I don't know that I do, exactly.\" Ole went over and locked the\ndoor. \"I thought that, as you cannot possibly know anything about it, I\nhad perhaps better tell you that people are talking about you,\ncalumniating you, blackening your reputation, so to speak. And you hear\nnothing, of course.\"\n",
                "\"Are they blackening me? What are they saying?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, you can feel above anything they say. Never mind what they say. The\ngossip is that you neglect your wife; that you frequent restaurants\nalthough you have a home of your own; that you leave her to herself while\nyou enjoy life single-handed. You are above such insinuations, of course.\nBut, anyway, why do you eat away from home and live so much in\nrestaurants? Not that I have any business to--Say, this wine is not half\nbad, believe me! Take another glass; do me the favour--\"\n",
                "Tidemand's eyes had suddenly become clear and sharp. He got up, made a few\nturns across the floor, and went back to the sofa.\n",
                "\"I am not at all surprised that people are talking,\" he said. \"I myself\nhave done what I could to start the gossip; I know that only too well. But\nI have ceased to care about anything any more.\" Tidemand shrugged his\nshoulders and got up again. Drifting back and forth across the floor,\nstaring fixedly straight ahead, he murmured again that he had ceased to\ncare about anything.\n",
                "\"But listen, old friend, I told you you need not pay the slightest\nattention to such contemptible gossip,\" objected Ole.\n",
                "\"It is not true that I neglect Hanka, as people think,\" said Tidemand;\n\"the fact is that I don't want to bother her. You understand, she must be\nallowed to do as she pleases; it is an agreement, otherwise she will leave\nme.\" During the following sentences Tidemand got up and sat down again; he\nwas in a state of deep emotion. \"I want to tell you this, Ole; it is the\nfirst time I have ever mentioned it to anybody, and no one will ever hear\nme repeat it. But I want you to know that I do not go to restaurants\nbecause I like to. Where else can I go? Hanka is never at home; there is\nno dinner, not a soul in the whole house. We have had a friendly\nunderstanding; we have ceased to keep house. Do you understand now why I\nam often seen in restaurants? I am not wanted; I keep to my office and go\nto the Grand, I meet friends of whom she is one, we sit at a table and\nhave a good time. What should I do at home? Hanka is more likely to be at\nthe Grand; we sit at the same table, perhaps opposite each other; we hand\neach other a glass, a carafe. 'Andreas,' she says, 'please order a glass\nfor Milde, too.' And, of course, I order a glass for Milde. I like to do\nit; don't believe anything else! 'I have hardly seen you to-day,' she\nsometimes says; 'you left very early this morning. Oh, he is a fine\nhusband!' she tells the others and laughs. I am delighted that she is in\ngood spirits; I help her along and say: 'Who in the world could wait until\nyou have finished your toilet; I have business to attend to!' But the\ntruth is that perhaps I haven't seen her for a couple of days. Do you\nunderstand why I go to restaurants? I go in order to meet her after not\nhaving seen her for a couple of days; I go to spend a few moments with her\nand with my friends, who all are exceedingly nice to me. But, of course,\neverything has been arranged in the friendliest manner possible; don't\nthink otherwise. I am sure it is all for the best; I think the arrangement\nexcellent. It is all a matter of habit.\"\n",
                "Ole Henriksen sat with open mouth. He said in surprise:\n",
                "\"Is that how matters stand? I had no idea it was that way with you two--\nthat it was that bad.\"\n",
                "\"Why not? Do you find it strange that she prefers the clique? All of them\nare famous men, artists and poets, people who count for something. When\nyou come to look at it they are not like you and me, Ole; we like to be\nwith them ourselves. Bad, you say? No, understand me rightly, it is not at\nall bad. It is a good arrangement. I couldn't always get home on time from\nthe office, and so I went to a restaurant, naturally. Hanka could not make\nherself ridiculous and preside at table in solitary state, and so she went\nto a restaurant. We do not go to the same place always; sometimes we miss\neach other. But that is all right.\"\n",
                "There was a pause. Tidemand leaned his head in his hands. Ole asked:\n",
                "\"But who started this? Who proposed it?\"\n",
                "\"Ha, do you think for a moment it was I? Would I be likely to say to my\nwife: 'You will have to go to a restaurant, Hanka, so I can find the house\nempty when I get home to dinner!' Hardly. But all the same, things are not\nso bad as you might think--What would you say if I were to tell you\nthat she does not even regard herself as being married? Of course, you\ncannot realise that. I reasoned with her, said this and that, a married\nwoman, house and home, and she answered: 'Married, did you say? That is\nrather an exaggeration, don't you think?' How does _that_ strike you?\nFor this reason I am careful not to say anything to her; she isn't\nmarried; that is her affair. She lives occasionally where I live, we visit\nthe children, go in and out, and part again. It is all right as long as\nshe is satisfied.\"\n",
                "\"But this is ridiculous!\" exclaimed Ole suddenly. \"I can't imagine--Does\nshe think you are an old glove she can throw away when she is through with\nit? Why haven't you put your foot down?\"\n",
                "\"Of course, I have said something like that. Then she wanted a divorce.\nTwice. What could I do then? I am not made so that I can tear everything\nup all at once; I need a little time; it will come later. She is right\nabout the divorce; it is I who am against it; she is justified in blaming\nme for that. Why haven't I played the part of a man, showed her her place,\nmade her behave? But, my dear man, she would have left me! She said so\nplainly; there was no misunderstanding possible; it has happened twice.\nWhat could I do?\"\n",
                "The two men sat awhile in silence. Ole asked quietly:\n",
                "\"But has your wife, then--I mean, do you think she is in love with\nsomebody else?\"\n",
                "\"Of course,\" answered Tidemand. \"Such things are bound to happen; not\nintentionally, of course, but--\"\n",
                "\"And you do not know who it is?\"\n",
                "\"Don't you think I know? That is, I don't know really; how could I know\nfor sure? I am almost certain she is not really in love with anybody; it\nis hard to say. Do you think that I am jealous, perhaps? Don't for a\nmoment imagine anything, Ole; I am glad to say that I have a little sense\nleft; not much, perhaps, but a little. In short, she is not in love with\nanybody else, as people suspect; it is simply a whim, a fancy. In a little\nwhile she will probably come and propose that we shall begin housekeeping\nagain and live together; it is not at all impossible, I tell you, for I\nknow her thoroughly. She is, at any rate, very fond of the children; I\nhave never seen anybody so fond of children as she has been lately. You\nought to come and see us some time--Do you remember when we were married?\"\n",
                "\"I certainly do.\"\n",
                "\"She was a somewhat passable bride, what? Not at all one to be ashamed of,\ndon't you think? Ha, ha, ha, not at all, Ole! But you ought to see her\nnow, I mean at home, now that she is so very fond of the children again. I\ncannot describe her. She wears a black velvet gown--Be sure and come over\nsome time. Sometimes she is in red, a dark red velvet--This reminds me--\nperhaps she is at home now; I am going to drop in; I might be able to do\nsomething for her.\"\n",
                "The two friends emptied their glasses and stood facing each other.\n",
                "\"I hope everything will come out all right,\" said Ole.\n",
                "\"Oh, yes, it will,\" said Tidemand. \"I am grateful to you, Ole; you have\nbeen a good friend to me. I haven't had such a pleasant hour as long as I\ncan remember.\"\n",
                "\"Listen!\" Tidemand turned in the doorway and said: \"What we have discussed\nhere remains between us, eh? Not a hint on Thursday; everything is as it\nshould be as far as we are concerned, what? We are no mopes, I hope!\"\n",
                "And Tidemand departed.\n"

The winches are still\ngroaning along the docks; cabs roll through the streets. But inside the\nhidden offices one old business chief after another has finished his\naccounts and his planning; the grey-headed gentlemen close their ledgers,\ntake their hats from the rack, put out the lights, and go home.\n",

                "\"In God's own time, as the Bible says--Of course, if I ever get rich,\nthen--But I want you to go now. I must be alone.\"\n",
                "\"All right, good night. But listen, seriously speaking: if you have\nanother crown to spare--\"\n",

                "\"A thousand thanks! Oh, you poets, you poets! Where, for instance, may you\nbe going now?\"\n",
                "\"I think I'll walk here awhile, and look at houses. I can't sleep, so I\ncount the windows; it is not such a bad occupation at times. I take an\nexquisite pleasure in satiating my vision with squares and rectangles,\nwith pure lines. Of course, you cannot understand such things.\"\n",
                "\"I should say I did understand--no one better! But I prefer human beings.\nDon't you at times--flesh and blood, humans, eh--they have their\nattraction, don't you think?\"\n",
                "\"I am ashamed to say it, but people weary me. No; take for instance the\nsweep of a solitary, deserted street--have you never noticed the charm of\nsuch a view?\"\n",
                "\"Haven't I? I am not blind, not entirely. A desolate street, of course,\nhas its own beauty, its own charm, in its kind the highest charm\nimaginable. But everything in its place--Well, I must not detain you!\n_Au revoir_--Thursday!\"\n",
                "Milde saluted with his cane, turned, and strolled up the street. Ojen\ncontinued alone. He proved a few moments afterward that he had not lost\nall his interest in human beings; he had calumniated himself. To the very\nfirst hussy who hailed him he gave, absent-mindedly, every penny he had\nleft, and continued his way in silence. He had not spoken a word; his\nslender, nervous figure disappeared in the darkness before the girl could\neven manage to thank him--\n",
                "And at last everything is still; the winches fall to rest along the\nwharves; the town has turned in. From afar, nobody knows from where, comes\nthe sound of a single footfall; the gas flames flicker in the street\nlamps; two policemen talk to each other, occasionally stamping their feet\nto keep warm.\n",
                "Thus the night passes. Human footsteps here and there; now and then a\npoliceman who stamps his feet to keep warm.\n"

                "A barnlike room with blue walls and sliding windows, a sort of drying-loft\nwith a stove in the middle, and with stovepipes hanging in wires along the\nceiling. The walls are decorated with a number of sketches, painted fans,\nand palettes; several framed pictures lean against the wainscoting. Smell\nof paints and tobacco smoke; brushes, tubes, overcoats which the guests\nhad thrown aside; an old rubber shoe filled with nails and junk; on the\neasel in the corner a large, half-finished portrait of Paulsberg.\n",
                "This was Milde's studio.\n",
                "When Ole Henriksen entered about nine o'clock all the guests were\nassembled, also Tidemand and his wife. There were altogether ten or twelve\npeople. The three lamps were covered with opaque shades, and the heavy\ntobacco smoke did not make the room any lighter. This obscurity was\nevidently Mrs. Hanka's idea. A couple of very young gentlemen, beardless\nstudents with bachelor degrees, were of the party; they were poets who had\nput aside their studies last year. Their heads were so closely cropped as\nto be almost entirely naked. One of them carried a small compass on his\nwatch-chain. They were Ojen's comrades, his admirers and pupils; both\nwrote verses.\n",
                "Besides these, one noticed a man from the _Gazette_, Journalist\nGregersen, the literary member of the staff. He was a man who did his\nfriends many a favour and published in his paper many an item concerning\nthem. Paulsberg showed him the greatest deference, and conversed with him\nabout his series, \"New Literature,\" which he found admirable; and the\nJournalist was happy and proud because of this approbation. He had a\npeculiar habit of twisting words so that they sounded odd and absurd, and\nnobody could turn this trick as smartly as he.\n",
                "\"It is rather difficult to write such a series within reasonable limits,\"\nhe says. \"There are so many authors that have to be included--a veritable\nchoas!\"\n",
                "He makes Paulsberg smile over this \"choas,\" and they talk on in the best\nof harmony.\n",

                "\"So the Attorney is not coming,\" says Mrs. Hanka Tidemand, without\nreferring to his wife. Mrs. Liberia never came, anyway.\n",
                "\"He sulks,\" said Milde, and drank with Norem, the Actor. \"He did not want\nto come because Norem was invited.\"\n",
                "Nobody felt the least constraint; they chatted about everything, drank,\nand made plenty of noise. It was a splendid place, Milde's studio; as soon\nas one got inside the door one felt free to do or say anything one's\ninclination prompted.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka is seated on the sofa; Ojen sits beside her. On the other side\nof the table sits Irgens; the light falls across his narrow chest. Mrs.\nHanka hardly glances at him.\n",
                "She is in her red velvet gown; her eyes have a greenish sheen. Her upper\nlip is slightly raised. One glimpses her teeth and marvels at their\nwhiteness. The face is fresh and the complexion clear. Her beautiful\nforehead is not hidden beneath her hair; she carries it sweetly and\ncandidly, like a nun. A couple of rings flash on her fingers. She breathes\ndeeply and says to Irgens, across the table:\n",
                "\"How hot it is here, Irgens!\"\n",
                "Irgens gets up and goes over to open a window, but a voice is raised in\nprotest; it is Mrs. Paulsberg's. \"For Heaven's sake, no open windows. Come\naway from the sofa; it is cooler further back!\"\n",
                "And Mrs. Hanka gets up. Her movements are undulating. When she stands up\nshe is like a young girl, with bold shoulders. She does not glance into\nthe large, cracked mirror as she passes; she exhales no odours of\nperfumes; she takes, accidentally, her husband's arm and walks up and down\nwith him while the conversation and the refreshments keep the other guests\nat the table.\n",
                "Tidemand is talking, with somewhat forced liveliness, about a cargo of\ngrain, a certain F\u00fcrst in Riga, a raise in customs duties somewhere.\nSuddenly he says, bending toward her:\n",
                "\"Yes; I am very happy to-day. But, pardon me, you are hardly interested in\nthese things--Did you see Ida before you left? Wasn't she sweet in her\nwhite dress? We'll get her a carriage when spring comes!\"\n",
                "\"Yes; in the country! I am beginning to long for it already!\" Mrs. Hanka\nherself is animated. \"You must get the garden and the grove fixed up. It\nwill be fine.\"\n",
                "And Tidemand, who already has arranged to have the country-house put in\norder, although it is not April yet, is delighted because of his wife's\nsudden interest. His sombre eyes brighten and he presses her arm.\n",
                "\"I want you to know, Hanka, I am very happy to-day,\" he exclaims.\n\"Everything will be all right soon, I am sure.\"\n",
                "\"Are you--What will be all right, by the way?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, nothing,\" he says quickly. He turns the subject, looks down, and\ncontinues: \"Business is booming; I have given F\u00fcrst orders to buy!\"\n",
                "Fool that he was! There he had once more made a mistake and bothered his\nwife with his shop talk. But Mrs. Hanka was good enough to overlook it;\nnobody could have answered more patiently and sweetly than did she:\n",
                "\"I am very glad to hear it!\"\n",
                "These gentle words embolden him; he is grateful and wants to show it as\nbest he can; he smiles with dewy eyes and says in a low voice:\n",
                "\"I should like to give you a little present if you care--a sort of\nsouvenir of this occasion. If there is anything you would like--\"\n",

                "\"No, my dear. What are you thinking of? Though, perhaps--you might let me\nhave a couple of hundred crowns. Thanks, very much!\" Suddenly she spies\nthe old rubber shoe with nails and junk, and she cries, full of curiosity:\n\"Whatever is this?\" She lets go her husband's arm and brings the rubber\nover to the table. \"Whatever have you got here, Milde?\" She rummages in\nthe rubbish with her white fingers, calls Irgens over, finds one strange\nthing after another, and asks questions concerning them. \"Will somebody\nplease tell me what this is good for?\"\n",
                "She has fished out an umbrella-handle which she throws aside at once; then\na lock of hair enclosed in paper. \"Look--a lock of somebody's hair! Come\nand see!\"\n",

                "\"Leave that alone!\" he said and took his cigar out of his mouth. \"However\ndid that get in there? Did you ever--hair from my last love, so to speak!\"\n",
                "This was sufficient to make everybody laugh. The Journalist shouted:\n",
                "\"But have you seen Milde's collection of corsets? Out with the corsets,\nMilde!\"\n",
                "And Milde did not refuse; he went into one of the side rooms and brought\nforth his package. There were both white and brown ones; the white ones\nwere a little grey, and Mrs. Paulsberg asked in surprise:\n",
                "\"But--have they been used?\"\n",
                "\"Of course; why do you think Milde collects them? Where would be their\nsentimental value otherwise?\" And the Journalist laughed heartily, happy\nto be able to twist even this word around.\n",
                "But the corpulent Milde wrapped his corsets together and said:\n",
                "\"This is a little specialty of mine, a talent--But what the dickens are\nyou all gaping at? It is my own corsets; I have used them myself--don't\nyou understand? I used them when I began to grow stout; I laced and\nthought it would help. But it helped like fun!\"\n",
                "Paulsberg shook his head and said to Norem:\n",
                "\"Your health, Norem! What nonsense is this I hear, that Grande objects to\nyour company?\"\n",
                "\"God only knows,\" says Norem, already half drunk. \"Can you imagine why? I\nhave never offended him in my life!\"\n",

                "They all agreed. Paulsberg very seldom said that much; usually he sat,\ndistant and unfathomable, and listened without speaking; he was respected\nby all. Only Irgens thought he could defy him; he was always ready with\nhis objections.\n",
                "\"I cannot see that this is something Paulsberg can decide,\" he said.\n",
                "They looked at him in surprise. Was that so? So Paulsberg could not decide\nthat? He! he! so that was beyond him? But who, then, could decide it?\n",
                "\"Irgens,\" answered Paulsberg caustically.\n",
                "Irgens looked at him; they gazed fixedly at each other. Mrs. Hanka stepped\nbetween them, sat down on a chair, and began to speak to Ojen.\n",
                "\"Listen a moment!\" she called after a while. \"Ojen wants to read his\nlatest--a prose poem.\"\n",
                "And they settled down to listen.\n",
                "Ojen brought forth his prose poem from an inside pocket; his hands\ntrembled.\n",
                "\"I must ask your indulgence,\" said he.\n",
                "But at this the two young students, the close-cropped poets, laughed\nloudly, and the one with the compass in his fob said admiringly:\n",
                "\"And _you_ ask for _our_ indulgence? What about us, then?\"\n",
                "\"Quiet!\"\n",
                "\"The title of this is 'Sentenced to Death,'\" said Ojen, and began:\n",
                "    For a long time I have wondered: What if my secret guilt were\n    known?...\n",
                "    Sh....\n",
                "    Yes, sh....\n",
                "    For then I should be sentenced to death.\n",
                "    And I would sit in my prison and know that I should be calm and\n    indifferent when the supreme moment should arrive.\n",
                "    I would ascend the steps of the scaffold, I would smile and humbly beg\n    permission to say a word.\n",
                "    And then I would speak. I would implore everybody to learn something\n    good from my death. A speech from my inmost heart, and my last\n    farewell should be like a breath of flame....\n",
                "    Now my secret guilt is known.\n",
                "    Yes!\n",
                "    And I am sentenced to death. And I have languished in prison so long\n    that my spirit is broken.\n",
                "    I ascend the steps to the scaffold; but to-day the sun is shining and\n    my eyes fill with tears.\n",
                "    For I have languished so long in prison that I am weak. And then the\n    sun is shining so--I haven't seen it for nine months, and I haven't\n    heard the birds sing for nine months--until to-day.\n",
                "    I smile in order to hide my tears and I ask humbly if my guards will\n    permit me to speak a word.\n",
                "    But they will not permit me.\n",
                "    Still I want to speak--not to show my courage, but really I want to\n    say a few words from my heart so as not to die mutely--innocent words\n    that will harm nobody, a couple of hurried sentences before they clap\n    their hands across my lips: Friends, see how God's sun is shining....\n",
                "    And I open my lips, but I cannot speak.\n",
                "    Am I afraid? Does my courage fail? Alas, no, I am not afraid. But I am\n    weak, that I am, and I cannot speak because I look upon God's sun and\n    the trees for the last time....\n",
                "    What now? A horseman with a white flag?\n",
                "    Peace, my heart, do not tremble so!\n",
                "    No, it is a woman with a white veil, a handsome woman of my own age.\n    Her neck is bare like my own.\n",
                "    And I do not understand it, but I weep because of this white veil,\n    too, because I am weak and the white veil flutters beautifully against\n    the green background of the forest. But in a little while I shall see\n    it no more....\n",
                "    Perhaps, though, after my head has fallen I may still be able to see\n    the blessed sky for a few moments with my eyes. It is not impossible,\n    if I only open my eyes widely when the axe falls. Then the sky will be\n    the last I see.\n",
                "    But don't they tie a bandage across my eyes? Or won't they blindfold\n    me because I am so weak and tearful? But then everything will be dark,\n    and I shall lie blindly, unable even to count the threads in the cloth\n    before my eyes.\n",
                "    How stupidly mistaken I was when I hoped to be able to turn my eyes\n    upward and behold the blessed vault of heaven. They will turn me over,\n    on my stomach, with my neck in a clamp. And I shall be able to see\n    nothing because of my bandaged eyes.\n",
                "    Probably there will be a small box suspended below me; and I cannot\n    even see the little box which I know will catch my severed head.\n",
                "    Only night--a seething darkness around me. I blink my eyes and believe\n    myself still alive--I have life in my fingers, even--I cling\n    stubbornly to life. If they would only take off the bandage so I could\n    see something--I might enjoy looking at the dust grains in the bottom\n    of the box and see how tiny they were....\n",
                "    Silence and Darkness. Mute exhalations from the crowds....\n",
                "    Merciful God! Grant me one supplication--take off the bandage!\n    Merciful God! I am _Thy_ creature--take off the bandage!\n",
                "Everybody was silent when he was through. Ojen drank; Milde was busy with\na spot on his vest, and did not understand a word of what he had heard; he\nlifted his glass to the Journalist and whispered:\n",
                "\"Your health!\"\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka spoke first; she smiled to Ojen and said, out of the goodness\nof her heart:\n",
                "\"Oh, you Ojen, you Ojen! How everything you write seems evanescent,\nethereal! 'Mute exhalations from the crowds'--I can hear it; I can feel\nit! It is thrilling!\"\n",
                "Everybody thought so, too, and Ojen was happy. Happiness was very becoming\nto his girlish face.\n",
                "\"Oh, it is only a little thing, a mood,\" he said. He would have liked to\nhear Paulsberg's opinion, but Paulsberg remained sphinxlike and silent.\n",
                "\"How _do_ you think of such things? These prose poems are really\nexquisite!\"\n",
                "\"It is my temperament, I suppose. I have no taste for fiction. In me\neverything turns to poetry, with or without rhymes; but verses always. I\nhave entirely ceased to use rhymes lately.\"\n",
                "\"But tell me--in what manner does your nervousness really affect you?\"\nasked Mrs. Hanka in her gentle voice. \"It is so very sad; you must really\ntry to get well again.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I'll try. It is hard to explain; at times I will suddenly become\nexcited without the slightest reason. I shudder; I simply tear myself to\npieces. Then I cannot bear to walk on carpets; if I should lose anything I\nshould never find it again. I should not hear it drop, and consequently I\nshould never think of looking for it. Can you imagine anything more\ndistracting than to have something you have lost lying there without your\nknowing it? It tortures me, therefore, to walk on carpets; I am in\nconstant fear and I keep my hands over my pockets; I look at my vest\nbuttons to be sure of them. I turn around again and again to make sure\nthat I haven't by chance lost something or other--And there are other\nannoyances: I have the strangest ideas, the most peculiar hallucinations.\nI place a glass on the very edge of the table and imagine I have made a\nbet with some one--a bet involving enormous amounts. Then I blow on the\nglass; if it falls I lose--lose an amount large enough to ruin me for\nlife; if it remains I have won and can build myself a castle on the\nMediterranean. It is the same whenever I go up a strange stairway: should\nthere be sixteen steps I win, but if there are eighteen I lose. Into this,\nthough, there enter other intricate possibilities: Suppose there should be\ntwenty steps, have I lost or won? I do not yield; I insist on my rights in\nthe matter; I go to law and lose my case--Well, you mustn't laugh; it is\nreally annoying. Of course these are only minor matters. I can give other\nexamples: Let somebody sit in a room next to yours and sing a single verse\nof a certain song, sing it endlessly, without ceasing, sing it through and\nbegin again; tell me--would this not drive you crazy? Where I live there\nis such a person, a tailor; he sits and sings and sews, and his singing is\nunceasing. You cannot stand it; you get up in a fury and go out. Then you\nrun into another torture. You meet a man, an acquaintance, with whom you\nenter into a conversation. But during this conversation you suddenly\nhappen to think of something pleasant, something good that is in store for\nyou, perhaps--something you wish to return to later and thoroughly enjoy.\nBut while you stand there talking you forget that pleasant thought, forget\nit cleanly and cannot recall it at any cost! Then comes the pain, the\nsuffering; you are racked on the wheel because you have lost this\nexquisite, secret enjoyment to which you could have treated yourself at no\ncost or trouble.\"\n",
                "\"It _must_ be strange! But you are going to the country, to the pine\nwoods now; you will get well again,\" says Mrs. Hanka, and feels like a\nmother.\n",
                "Milde chimes in:\n",
                "\"Of course you will. And think of us when you are in your kingdom.\"\n",
                "Ole Henriksen had remained quietly in his chair; he said little and smoked\nhis cigar. He knew Torahus; he gave Ojen a hint about visiting the house\nof the county judge, which was a mile away. He had only to row across a\nlake; pine woods all around--the house looked like a little white marble\npalace in the green surroundings.\n",
                "\"How do you know all this?\" asked Irgens, quite surprised to hear Ole\nspeak.\n",
                "\"I went through there on a walking trip,\" answered Ole, embarrassed. \"We\nwere a couple of boys from the college. We stopped at the house and had a\nglass of milk.\"\n",
                "\"Your health, Mr. College Man!\" called the Journalist sarcastically.\n",
                "\"Be sure and row over,\" said Ole. \"County Judge Lynum's family is\ncharming. There is even a young girl in the house if you care to fall in\nlove,\" he added smilingly.\n",
                "\"He, he! No; whatever else one can accuse Ojen of, the ladies he leaves\nseverely alone!\" said Norem, good-natured and tipsy.\n",
                "\"Your health, Mr. College Man!\" shouted Gregersen again.\n",
                "Ole Henriksen looked at him.\n",
                "\"Do you mean me?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"Of course, I mean you, certainly I do! Haven't you attended college?\nWell, aren't you a college man, then?\"\n",
                "The Journalist, too, was a little tipsy.\n",
                "\"It was only a business college,\" said Ole quietly.\n",
                "\"Of course, you are a peddler, yes. But there is no reason why you should\nbe ashamed of that. Is there, Tidemand? I say there is no reason whatever!\nDoes anybody feel called upon to object?\"\n",
                "Tidemand did not answer. The Journalist kept obstinately to the question;\nhe frowned and thought of nothing else, afraid to forget what he had asked\nabout. He began to lose his temper; he demanded a reply in a loud voice.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka said suddenly:\n",
                "\"Silence, now. Ojen is going to read another poem.\"\n",
                "Both Paulsberg and Irgens made secretly a wry face, but they said nothing;\non the contrary, Paulsberg nodded encouragingly. When the noise had\nsubsided a little Ojen got up, stepped back, and said:\n",
                "\"I know this by heart. It is called 'The Power of Love.'\"\n",
                "    We rode in a railway carriage through a strange landscape--strange to\n    me, strange to her. We were also strangers to each other; we had never\n    met before. Why is she sitting so quietly? I wondered. And I bent\n    toward her and said, while my heart hammered:\n",
                "    \"Are you grieving for somebody, madam? Have you left a friend where\n    you come from--a very dear friend?\"\n",
                "    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"a very dear friend.\"\n",
                "    \"And now you sit here unable to forget this friend?\" I asked.\n",
                "    And she answered and shook her head sadly:\n",
                "    \"No, no--I can never forget him.\"\n",
                "    She was silent. She had not looked at me while she spoke.\n",
                "    \"May I lift your braid?\" I asked her. \"What a lovely braid--how very\n    beautiful it is!\"\n",
                "    \"My friend has kissed it,\" she said, and pushed back my hand.\n",
                "    \"Forgive me,\" I said then, and my heart pounded more and more. \"May I\n    not look at your ring--it shines so golden and is also so very\n    beautiful. I should like to look at it and admire it for your sake.\"\n",
                "    But to this she also said no and added:\n",
                "    \"My friend has given it to me.\"\n",
                "    Then she moved still further away from me.\n",
                "    \"Please forgive me,\" I said....\n",
                "    Time passes, the train rolls on, the journey is so long, so long and\n    wearisome, there is nothing we can do except listen to the rumbling of\n    the wheels. An engine flares past, it sounds like iron striking iron,\n    and I start, but she does not; she is probably entirely absorbed in\n    thoughts about her friend. And the train rolls on.\n",
                "    Then, for the first time, she glances at me, and her eyes are\n    strangely blue.\n",
                "    \"It grows darker?\" she says.\n",
                "    \"We are approaching a tunnel,\" I answer.\n",
                "    And we rode through the tunnel.\n",
                "    Some time passes. She glances at me, a trifle impatiently, and says:\n",
                "    \"It seems to me it grows dark again?\"\n",
                "    \"We are drawing near the second tunnel, there are three altogether,\" I\n    answer. \"Here is a map--do you want to see?\"\n",
                "    \"It frightens me,\" she says and moves closer to me. I say nothing. She\n    asks me smilingly:\n",
                "    \"Did you say three tunnels? Is there one more besides this one?\"\n",
                "    \"Yes--one more.\"\n",
                "    We enter the tunnel; I feel that she is very close to me, her hand\n    touches mine. Then it grows light again and we are once more in the\n    open.\n",
                "    We ride for a quarter of an hour. She is now so close to me that I\n    feel the warmth from her.\n",
                "    \"You are welcome to lift my braid if you wish to,\" she says, \"and if\n    you care to look at my ring--why, here it is!\"\n",
                "    I held her braid and did not take her ring because her friend had\n    given it to her. She smiled and did not offer it to me again.\n",
                "    \"Your eyes are so bright, and how white your teeth!\" she said and grew\n    confused. \"I am afraid of that last tunnel--please hold my hand when\n    we get to it. No--don't hold my hand; I didn't mean that, I was\n    jesting; but talk to me.\"\n",
                "    I promised to do what she asked me to.\n",
                "    A few moments later she laughed and said:\n",
                "    \"I was not afraid of the other tunnels; only this one frightens me.\"\n",
                "    She glanced at my face to see how I might answer, and I said:\n",
                "    \"This is the longest, too; it is exceedingly long.\"\n",
                "    Her confusion was now at its highest.\n",
                "    \"But we are not near any tunnel,\" she cried. \"You are deceiving me;\n    there is no tunnel!\"\n",
                "    \"Yes, there is, the last one--look!\"\n",
                "    And I pointed to my map. But she would see nothing and listen to\n    nothing.\n",
                "    \"No, no,--there is no tunnel, I tell you there is none! But speak to\n    me if there be one!\" she added.\n",
                "    She leaned back against the cushions, and smiled through half-closed\n    lids.\n",
                "    The engine whistled; I looked out; we were approaching the black\n    opening. I remembered that I had promised to speak to her; I bent\n    towards her, and in the darkness I felt her arms around my neck.\n",
                "    \"Speak to me, please do! I am so frightened!\" she whispered with\n    beating heart. \"Why don't you speak to me?\"\n",
                "    I felt plainly how her heart was beating, and I placed my lips close\n    to her ears and whispered:\n",
                "    \"But now you are forgetting your friend!\"\n",
                "    She heard me, she trembled and let me go quickly; she pushed me away\n    with both hands, and threw herself down in the seat. I sat there\n    alone. I heard her sobs through the darkness.\n",
                "\"This was The Power of Love,\" Ojen said.\n",
                "Everybody listened attentively; Milde sat with open mouth.\n",
                "\"Well--what more?\" he asked, evidently thinking there must be a climax yet\nto come. \"Is that all? But Heaven preserve us, man, what is it all about?\nNo; the so-called poetry you young writers are dishing out nowadays--I\ncall it arrant rot!\"\n",
                "They all laughed loudly. The effect was spoiled; the poet with the compass\nin his fob arose, pointed straight at Milde, and said furiously:\n",
                "\"This gentleman evidently lacks all understanding of modern poetry.\"\n",
                "\"Modern poetry! This sniffing at the moon and the sun, these filigree\nphrases and unintelligible fancies--There must, at least, be a point, a\nclimax, to everything!\"\n",
                "Ojen was pale and furious.\n",
                "\"You have then not the slightest understanding of my new intentions,\" said\nthe poor fellow, trembling with excitement. \"But, then, you are a brute,\nMilde; one could not expect intelligent appreciation from you.\"\n",
                "Only now did the fat painter realise how much he had offended; he had\nhardly expected this when he spoke.\n",
                "\"A brute?\" he answered good-naturedly. \"It seems we are beginning to\nexpress ourselves very plainly. I did not mean to insult you, anyway.\nDon't you think I enjoyed the poem? I did, I tell you; enjoyed it\nimmensely. I only thought it a little disembodied, so to speak, somewhat\nethereal. Understand me correctly: it is very beautiful, exceedingly\nartistic, one of the best things you have produced yet. Can't you take a\njoke any more?\"\n",
                "But it was of no avail that Milde tried to smooth things over; the\nseriousness of the moment had gone, they laughed and shouted more than\never, and cut loose in earnest. Norem opened one of the windows and sang\nto the street below.\n",
                "To mend matters a little and make Ojen feel better, Mrs. Hanka placed her\nhand on his shoulder and promised to come and see him off when he started\non his trip. Not she alone--they would all come. When was he going?\n",
                "She turned to Ole Henriksen: \"You'll come, won't you, and see Ojen off\nwhen he goes?\"\n",
                "Ole Henriksen then gave an unexpected reply which surprised even Mrs.\nHanka: He would not only go with Ojen to the station, he would go with him\nall the way to Torahus. Yes, he had suddenly made up his mind, he would\nmake this little trip; he had, in fact, a sort of reason for going--And\nhe was so much in earnest that he buttonholed Ojen at once and arranged\nthe day for the departure.\n",
                "The Journalist drank with Mrs. Paulsberg, who held her glass in a peculiar\nmasculine fashion. They moved over to the sofa on account of the draught,\nand told each other amusing anecdotes. Mrs. Paulsberg knew a story\nconcerning Grande and one of Pastor B.'s daughters. She had reached the\nclimax when she paused.\n",
                "\"Well--go on!\" the Journalist exclaimed eagerly.\n",
                "\"Wait a moment!\" answered Mrs. Paulsberg smilingly, \"you must at least\ngive me time to blush a little!\"\n",
                "And she recounted merrily the climax.\n",
                "Norem had retired to a corner and was fast asleep.\n",
                "\"Does anybody know the time?\" asked Mrs. Paulsberg.\n",
                "\"Don't ask me,\" said Gregersen, and fumbled at his vest pocket. \"It is\nmany a day since I carried a watch!\"\n",
                "It turned out that it was one o'clock.\n",
                "About half-past one Mrs. Hanka and Irgens had disappeared. Irgens had\nasked Milde for roasted coffee, and since then had not been seen. Nobody\nseemed to think it strange that the two had sneaked away, and no questions\nwere asked; Tidemand was talking to Ole Henriksen about his trip to\nTorahus.\n",
                "\"But have you time to run off like this?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"I'll take time,\" answered Ole. \"By the way, I want to tell you something\nby and by.\"\n",
                "Around Paulsberg's table the political situation was being discussed.\nMilde once more threatened to banish himself to Australia. But, thank\nHeaven, it now looked as if Parliament would do something before it was\ndissolved, would refuse to yield.\n",
                "\"It is a matter of indifference to me what it does,\" said Gregersen of the\n_Gazette_. \"As things have been going, Norway has assumed the\ncharacter of a beaten country. We are decidedly poverty-stricken, in every\nrespect; we lack power, both in politics and in our civic life. How sad to\ncontemplate the general decline! What miserable remnants are left of the\nintellectual life that once flamed up so brightly, that called loudly to\nHeaven in the seventies! The aged go the way of the flesh; who is there to\ntake their places? I am sick of this decadence; I cannot thrive in low\nintellectual altitudes!\"\n",
                "Everybody looked at the Journalist; what was the matter with the\never-merry chap? He was not so very drunk now; he spoke passably clearly,\nand did not twist any words. What did he mean? But when the witty dog\nreached the declaration that he could only thrive in a high spiritual\naltitude, then the guests broke into peals of merriment and understood\nthat it was a capital hoax. The merry blade--hadn't he almost fooled them\nall! \"Poor remnants of the intellectual life of the seventies!\" Didn't we\nhave Paulsberg and Irgens, and Ojen and Milde, and the two close-cropped\npoets, and an entire army of first-class, sprouting talents besides!\n",
                "The Journalist himself laughed and wiped his forehead and laughed again.\nIt was generally believed that this fellow was possessed of a literary\ntalent which had not entirely stagnated in his newspaper. A book might be\nexpected from him some day, a remarkable work.\n",
                "Paulsberg forced a smile. In reality he was offended because nobody had\nalluded to his novels or to his work on the Atonement during the entire\nevening. When therefore the Journalist asked him his opinion concerning\nthe intellectual life of the nation, his reply was brief:\n",
                "\"It seems to me I have had occasion to express an opinion somewhere in my\nworks.\"\n",
                "Of course, of course; when they came to think of it they certainly\nremembered it. It was true; a speech somewhere or other. Mrs. Paulsberg\nquoted from book and page.\n",
                "But Paulsberg made up his mind to leave now.\n",
                "\"I'll come and sit for you to-morrow,\" he said to Milde, with a glance at\nthe easel. He got up, emptied his glass, and found his overcoat. His wife\npressed everybody's hand vigorously. They met Mrs. Hanka and Irgens in the\ndoor.\n",
                "From now on the merriment knew no bounds; they drank like sponges; even\nthe two young poets kept up as well as they could, and talked with\nbloodshot eyes about Baudelaire. Milde demanded to know why Irgens had\nasked him for coffee. Why did he need coffee? He hoped he had not been\nmaking preparations to kiss Mrs. Hanka? Damn him, he would hate to trust\nhim.... Tidemand hears this and he laughs with the others, louder than the\nothers, and he says: \"You are right, he is not to be trusted, the sly\ndog!\" Tidemand was sober as always.\n",
                "They did not restrain themselves; the conversation was free and they swore\nliberally. When all was said and done, it was prudery that was Norway's\ncurse and Norway's bane; people preferred to let their young girls go to\nthe dogs in ignorance rather than enlighten them while there was time.\nPrudery was the nourishing vice of the moment. So help me, there ought to\nbe public men appointed for the sole purpose of shouting obscenity on the\nstreets just to make young girls acquainted with certain things while\nthere was still time. What, do you object, Tidemand?\n",
                "No, Tidemand did not object, and Ole Henriksen did not object. The idea\nwas original, to say the least. Ha, ha!\n",
                "Milde got Tidemand over in a corner.\n",
                "\"It is like this,\" he said, \"I wonder if you have got a couple of crowns?\"\n",
                "Yes; Tidemand was not entirely stripped. How much? A ten-spot?\n",
                "\"Thanks, old man, I'll give it back to you shortly,\" said Milde in all\nseriousness. \"Very soon, now. You are a brick! It is not more than a\ncouple of days since I said that you hucksters were great fellows. That is\nexactly what I said. Here is my hand!\"\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka got up at last; she wanted to leave. It was beginning to grow\nlight outside.\n",
                "Her husband kept close by her.\n",
                "\"Yes, Hanka, that is right--let us be going,\" he said. He was on the point\nof offering her his arm.\n",
                "\"Thank you, my friend, but I have an escort,\" she said with an indifferent\nglance.\n",
                "It took him a moment to recover himself.\n",
                "\"Oh, I see,\" he said with a forced smile. \"It is all right; I only\nthought--\"\n",
                "He walked over to the window and remained standing there.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka said good night to everybody. When she came to Irgens she\nwhispered eagerly, breathlessly: \"To-morrow, then, at three.\" She kept\nOjen's hand in hers and asked him when he was going. Had he remembered to\nmake reservations at Torahus? No; she might have known it; these poets\nwere always forgetting the most essential. He would have to telegraph at\nonce. Good-bye! And get well soon.... She was maternal to the last.\n",

You never heard anything so\nridiculous; we came there, two thirsty tourists, and they gave us milk;\nsince then I have met the family when they came to town last fall and this\nwinter. It is quite a family--seven altogether, including the tutor. The\noldest daughter's name is Aagot. I'll tell you more about them later.\nAagot was eighteen the 7th of December; ha, ha! she is in her nineteenth\nyear; I happen to remember that she told me.

                "\"Of course, that is perfectly true.\" Tidemand accepted this explanation.\nHe was happy because his wife was alone and was making straight for home.\nHe said, nervously glad: \"Do you know, to judge by a few words I had with\nher this evening it seems as if things were coming around more and more.\nShe even asked about the business, about the Russian customs duty; honest,\nshe wanted to know everything about F\u00fcrst.

Her blond\nhair and her frequent laughter gave an impression of extreme youthfulness.\nShe had a dimple in her left cheek and none in her right, and this\nsolitary dimple made her peculiar, characteristic.

She was often unable to understand\nhow Ole managed to keep all these accounts straight without getting the\namounts mixed; she had tried it herself, but in vain. The only thing she\ncan be trusted with is the entering of endless orders in the books, and\nthis she does carefully and conscientiously.\n",
                "Ole looks at her and says suddenly:\n",
                "\"Lord, what tiny hands you have, Aagot! He, he! they are next to nothing.\nI can't understand how you can get along with them.\"\n",
                "That is enough. Aagot throws down her pen and runs over to him. And they\nare happy and silly until the next slate arrives.\n",
                "\"Little Mistress!\" he says smilingly, and looks down into her eyes,\n\"Little Mistress!\"\n",
                "Time passes. At last the work is done, the accounts finished, and Ole\nsays, while he slams the ledger shut:\n",
                "\"Well, I have got to go and send some wires. Are you coming along?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, dear, if you'll let me!\" she answers. And she trips along, greatly\npleased.\n",
                "On the way Ole remembers that he has not as yet presented his sweetheart\nto Irgens. \"You ought to meet this fellow Irgens,\" he says; \"he is a great\nman, one of the deep talents; everybody says so.\" Suppose they went as far\nas the Grand; he might be there.\n",
                "They entered the Grand, passed by the tables where people sat drinking\nand smoking, and found Irgens far back in the room. Milde and Norem were\nwith him.\n",
                "\"So here you are!\" called Ole.\n",
                "Irgens gave him his left hand and did not get up. He glanced through\nhalf-closed lids at Aagot.\n",
                "\"This, Aagot, is the poet Irgens.\" Ole presented him, somewhat proud of\nhis intimate acquaintance with the great man. \"My fianc\u00e9e, Miss Lynum.\"\n",
                "Irgens got up and bowed deeply. Once more he looked at Aagot, looked\npersistently, even, and she looked back at him; she was evidently\nsurprised to find the poet different from what she had thought. It was\nover two years since she had read his book, the lyric drama which had\nbrought him so much fame. She had thought the master to be an elderly man.\n",
                "\"May I congratulate?\" said Irgens finally, and gave Ole his hand.\n",
                "They all sat down; each got a seidel and began a conversation. The spirits\naround the little table rose; even Irgens grew communicative and joined\nin. He addressed Aagot across the table, asked if she had been in the city\nbefore, in the theatre, in Tivoli, read this book or that, visited the\nExhibition of paintings? \"But, Miss Lynum, you must really see the\nExhibition! I should be delighted to show it to you if you cannot find a\nbetter guide--\" They conversed for about ten minutes across the table, and\nAagot replied rapidly to every question, sometimes laughing, now and then\nforgetting herself and asking questions with her head tilted sideways; her\neyes were wide open and sparkling; she was not the least bit embarrassed.\n",
                "Ole called the waiter. He had to leave; he was going to the telegraph\noffice. Aagot, too, got up.\n",
                "\"But there is no reason why you should go, Miss Lynum,\" said Milde. \"You\ncan come back for Miss Lynum when you have telegraphed, Ole.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I am going,\" said Aagot.\n",
                "\"But if you want to stay I'll call for you in a few moments,\" said Ole and\ntook his hat.\n",
                "She looked at him and answered almost in a whisper:\n",
                "\"Won't you let me come with you?\"\n",
                "\"Certainly, if you want to.\"\n",
                "Ole paid his check.\n",
                "\"Say,\" said Milde, \"be good enough to settle this check, too. None of us\nis very flush to-day.\" And he smiled and glanced at Aagot.\n",
                "Ole settled, said good-bye, and walked out with Aagot on his arm.\n",
                "The three gentlemen looked after her.\n",
                "\"The devil!\" murmured Irgens in sincere admiration. \"Did you notice her.\"\n",
                "\"Did we! How the dickens did that groceryman get hold of such a beauty?\"\n",
                "Milde agreed with the Actor; it was simply incomprehensible. What in the\nworld could she be thinking of!\n",
                "\"Don't talk so loud; they have stopped over by the entrance,\" said Irgens.\n",
                "They had run across the Attorney. The same introduction followed; a little\ntalk could not be avoided. They did not remove their hats and gloves and\nwere ready to go at a moment's notice. At last they left.\n",
                "That very moment a man got up from one of the farthest tables and\napproached the entrance.... He was a man in the forties, with greyish\nbeard and dark eyes; his clothes were a little shabby; he was partly bald.\n",
                "He walked straight over to the Attorney, bowed, and said:\n",
                "\"Do you mind if I sit down here? I noticed that Mr. Henriksen spoke to\nyou; you must know him, then. As for me, I am acquainted with Miss Lynum,\nwho was introduced to you. I am the tutor in her home; my name is\nColdevin.\"\n",
                "Something about the stranger appealed to the little Attorney's curiosity;\nhe made room for him at once and even offered him a cigar. The waiter\nbrought his glass over.\n",
                "\"I visit the city only very seldom,\" said Coldevin. \"I live in the\ncountry. During the last ten years I have hardly been anywhere with the\nexception of a trip to Copenhagen during the Exhibition. So I run around\nall day and look things over. There are many changes; the city grows\nbigger and bigger.\"\n",
                "\"It is a pleasure to walk around down by the docks and watch the traffic.\"\n",
                "His voice was well modulated; he spoke simply and quietly, although his\neyes at times glowed with a smouldering fire.\n",
                "The Attorney listened and answered cordially. Yes, one had to admit that\nthe city was making progress; an electric car line was being built;\nseveral more streets were going to be asphalted; the last census showed an\nenormous increase.... Wasn't it strange to live in the country always? No?\nBut in the winter--in the darkness and the snow?\n",
                "No; it was glorious! Dazzling snow everywhere; silent, wild woods,\nptarmigan, hares, and foxes. White, glittering white snow! But summer, of\ncourse, was more beautiful. It would be high summer when he returned; his\nintention was to stay a couple of months, perhaps even longer. That ought\nto suffice to see and hear most of what went on. What was happening,\nanyway? What was the situation?\n",
                "\"Well,\" answered the Attorney, \"the situation is serious. But we place our\nfaith in Parliament. Several of the leaders have given their ultimatum; if\nall signs do not fail, they surely will make short shrift this time.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, if the signs do not fail--\"\n",
                "\"You appear to have your doubts?\" asked the Attorney smilingly.\n",
                "\"No; only there seems to be too much confidence placed in the leaders and\nin their promises. I come from the country; we have our suspicions; it is\nhard to get rid of them. The leaders might fail us now as heretofore.\nIndeed, they might.\"\n",
                "Coldevin drank from his glass.\n",
                "\"I cannot say that I remember their failing us heretofore,\" said the\nAttorney. \"Do you refer to any particular occasion when the leaders have\nbetrayed us?\"\n",
                "\"Well, yes. Promises have been broken, promises have been interpreted,\npromises have been openly and dispassionately denied. We should not forget\nthese things. One should not rely too much on the leaders; the country's\nyouth should be our hope. No; a leader is apt to prove a broken reed. It\nis an old law that whenever a leader reaches a certain age he pauses--yes,\nhe even turns right about face and pushes the other way. Then it is up to\nthe young to march on, to drive him ahead or trample him down.\"\n",
                "The door opened and Lars Paulsberg entered. He nodded to the Attorney, who\nreturned his greeting. The Attorney pointed to a chair at his table, but\nPaulsberg shook his head and said:\n",
                "\"No, I am looking for Milde. He has not done a stroke on my picture\nto-day.\"\n",
                "\"Milde is over in the corner,\" said the Attorney. And he turned to\nColdevin and whispered: \"This is one of the most prominent of our young\nmen--their leader, so to speak, Lars Paulsberg. Do you know him? If only\nthe rest were like him.\"\n",
                "Yes, Coldevin knew his name. So this was Paulsberg? He could plainly see\nthat he was an important personality; people craned their necks, looked\nafter him and whispered. Yes, indeed, we had quite a number of writers, it\ncould not be denied--\"There came to Torahus, for instance, one of them\nbefore I left; his name was Stefan Ojen. I have read two of his books. He\nwas nervous, he told me; he spoke a good deal about a new school, a new\nintention within the realm of literature. His clothes were silk lined, but\nhe did not put himself forward much. Of course, people were curious and\nwanted to see him, but he appeared very modest. I met him one evening; his\nentire shirt-front was covered with writing, with verses--long and short\nlines, a poem in prose. He said that he had waked up in the morning and\nfound himself in the throes of an inspiration, and, as he had no paper\nhandy, he simply wrote on his shirt-front. He asked us not to mind it; he\nhad two more shirts with him, but as they were unlaundered he had to use\nthat one for his verses. He read something for us, things full of\nsentiment. He gave us the impression that he was very clever.\"\n",
                "The Attorney did not know if this were irony or not, for Coldevin smiled\none of his rare smiles. But he was probably serious.\n",
                "\"Yes, Ojen is one of our most significant ones,\" he said. \"He is beginning\nto create a school in Germany. There can be no doubt that his poetry is\nunique.\"\n",
                "\"Exactly. I, too, got that impression. A little childish, perhaps; a\nlittle immature, but--He, he! as we were sitting there that evening he\nsuddenly exclaimed: 'Do you know, gentlemen, why I use a capital R in\nGod?' 'A capital R in God!' we wondered and looked at each other blankly;\nno; we did not know why. But Ojen burst into a peal of laughter and left--\nIt was a good joke; it wasn't at all bad, he, he!\"\n",
                "And Coldevin smiled.\n",
                "The Attorney laughed with him. \"Oh, that fellow Ojen could surprise you\nwith far better inventions; that was nothing for him. But his writing was\neuphonious, his diction pure--Do you know Irgens?\"\n",
                "Yes, Coldevin knew his name. He hadn't written very much?\n",
                "\"He does not write for the masses, no,\" answered the Attorney. \"He writes\nfor the chosen few. But his friends know that he has many beautiful things\nunpublished. Good God, what a master! It is impossible to place one's\nfinger on a single thing he has done and say that it is below par. He is\nsitting in the corner now. Do you wish to meet him? I can arrange it for\nyou. I know him well; no preliminaries are necessary.\"\n",
                "But Coldevin asked to be excused. Some other time; then he could meet\nPaulsberg and the others also--\"So that is Paulsberg!\" he repeated. \"One\ncould tell it when he passed by; people were whispering about him. Nobody\nwhispered when Ole Henriksen passed by. By the way, I suppose Mr.\nHenriksen is going to get married now?\"\n",
                "\"I suppose so--Tell me--is it at all interesting to be a tutor? Isn't it\na somewhat tedious occupation at times?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, no,\" answered Coldevin smilingly. \"Of course, it depends a good deal\non both parents and children. It is all right if one happens to get among\ngood people. It is, of course, only a poor and modest situation, but--I\nwould not change even if I could.\"\n",
                "\"Are you a college man?\"\n",
                "\"Theology, yes. Unfortunately, a rather antiquated student now.\" And\nColdevin smiled once more.\n",
                "They continued the conversation for some time, told a couple of anecdotes\nabout a university professor, and drifted back to the situation. Finally\nthey discussed the grain prices. It looked bad; there was some talk of\ncrop failures in Russia.\n",
                "Coldevin was absolutely normal in his talk; he evidently was well informed\nand spoke quietly and thoughtfully. When he got up to leave he asked\ncasually:\n",
                "\"By the way, do you happen to know where Mr. Henriksen went?\"\n",
                "\"To the telegraph office. He told me he had some wires to send.\"\n",
                "\"Thank you. I trust you will pardon me for descending upon you so\ninformally. It is kind of you to allow me to make your acquaintance.\"\n",
                "\"If you are going to stay awhile I trust we shall meet again,\" said the\nAttorney amiably. Coldevin took his leave.\n",
                "He walked straight to the telegraph office. He remained outside awhile;\nthen he ascended the stairs and peeped through the glass doors. Then he\nturned, went back to the street, and made for the harbour. He sauntered\nback and forth outside the Henriksen warehouse and glanced furtively\ntoward the little office window. He did not take his eyes from the window\nfor a long time. One would have thought he was anxious to find Ole\nHenriksen but did not know whether he was in the warehouse or not.\n"

The elegant man whom nobody suspected of doing anything sat there\nin all secret and corrected proofs and slaved like a farmer. Who would\nhave believed it? He was the one in the clique who talked least about his\nwork; nobody could understand how he managed to live. It was more than two\nyears since his drama had been published, and he had apparently not done a\nstroke of work since. Of course, he might be working quietly, but nobody\nknew anything about it, nothing definitely. He owed a lot of money.\n",
                "Irgens had locked his door so as not to be disturbed; he was very\nsecretive. When he had finished his proof-reading he got up and looked out\nof the window. The weather was bright and sunny, a glorious day. He was\ngoing to take Miss Lynum to the Art Exhibition at three. He looked forward\nto this pleasure; it was really enjoyable to listen to this\nunsophisticated girl's chatter. She had burst upon him like a revelation;\nshe reminded him of the first bird notes in spring.\n",
                "There was a knock at the door. His first thought was to throw the proofs\nbeneath the table-cloth, but he refrained. He opened. He knew this knock;\nit was Mrs. Hanka's finger which knocked twice so resolutely. She entered,\nclosed the door, and glided over to him. She smiled, bent toward him, and\nlooked into his eyes.\n",
                "\"It isn't me at all!\" she said, and laughed quietly. \"I want you to know\nthat!\" She could not hide her embarrassment entirely and flushed deeply.\n",
                "She wore a grey woollen gown, and looked very young with her low lace\ncollar and her bare neck.\n",
                "He said:\n",

                "They sat down. He placed before her the proof-sheet, and she clapped her\nhands and cried: \"Didn't I tell you? I knew it! No; but you are\nwonderful!\" And she did not get tired of marvelling at him--that he was\nthat far already! Oh, but wouldn't it come like a thunderclap; not a soul\nsuspected anything! They all went around thinking that he did not work any\nmore. Oh, Heavens! but nobody in the wide world was half as happy as she.\nShe smuggled an envelope with something in it under the proof-sheet and\npulled him away from the table. She talked all the time.\n",
                "They sat down on the sofa. Her happiness, her violent joy, communicated\nitself to him, carried him away, and made him tender with gratitude. How\nshe loved him, how she sacrificed herself for him and did for him what she\ncould! He embraced her passionately, kissed her time and again, and held\nher close to his breast.\n",
                "\"I am so happy,\" she whispered. \"I knew something was going to make me\nglad; as I walked upstairs it seemed as if I were going into an embrace!\nDearest boy, no--the door--!\"\n",

                "\"Do you think so?\" he answered smilingly. He walked over to the window and\nbegan to pluck from his clothes the fine, grey woolly fuzz her dress had\nleft there. She sat still on the sofa, her eyes on the floor, blushing,\narranging her hair a little. A ring flashed on each of her hands.\n",
                "He could not remain there at the window so indifferently. She was\nbeginning to notice it; she looked up; and besides, she was remarkably\nbeautiful as she sat there fixing her hair. He stepped over to her and\nkissed her as warmly as he could.\n",
                "\"Don't kiss me, darling,\" she said; \"be careful! Look here--it is the\nspring air.\"\n",
                "She showed him a little red spot on her under lip. He asked her if it\nhurt, and she answered that it was not that, but she was afraid he might\ncatch it from her. Suddenly she asked:\n",
                "\"Listen, can you come to Tivoli to-night? There is an operatic\nperformance. Couldn't we meet there? Otherwise I'll die of loneliness.\"\n",
                "He remembered that he was going to the Art Exhibition. What might happen\nafterward was hard to tell; he had better not promise anything. No, he\nsaid, he was afraid it would be impossible; he had made certain\narrangements with Ole Henriksen.\n",

I am just like a compass-needle now: I oscillate, I may even\nswing all the way round, but I hark constantly back to one point--I point\ncontinually in one direction. It is you I am thinking of always.\"\n",
                "Her little bewildered heart trembled. He looked at her. He knew it only\ntoo well--there was nothing he could reproach her with; she had been more\nthan good to him. However, all he could promise was that he would come if\nat all possible.\n",

                "Mrs. Hanka had left. Irgens was ready to go out; he put his proof-sheets\nin his pocket and took his hat. Had he forgotten anything? He had the\nproofs; that was the most important thing at present--the beginning of a\nbook which was to startle the community with the suddenness of an\nexplosion. He was going to see if his quiet industry would be denied\nappreciation. He, too, was going to send in an application for the\ngovernment subsidy; he would delay until the very last day in order to\navoid having his name paraded in the daily press alongside all those\nnonentities who already were licking their chops in anticipation of this\nmodest emolument. His application should be brief and to the point,\nwithout recommendations, simply accompanied by his book. He would tell\nnobody, not even Mrs. Hanka. They should not be able to say that he had\nmoved heaven and earth in order to secure this well-earned encouragement.\nBut he was curious to see if they would ignore him. He knew all his fellow\napplicants, from Milde to Ojen; he did not fear any of them. He would have\npreferred to stand back and yield his right to this charity, but he could\nnot afford it; he was obliged to accept it.\n",
                "He brushed his clothes carefully all the way down the street; a little of\nthe grey wool still clung to him--what a provoking dress! He dropped into\na printing-office with his proofs. The foreman called his attention to a\nletter, an envelope with something enclosed, which he found between the\nsheets. Irgens turned in the door. A letter? Oh, yes; he had forgotten it.\nHe knew this envelope and he opened it at once. When he had seen what was\nin it he lifted his brows, greatly pleased. The envelope he put in his\npocket without further ado.\n",
                "Ole and Aagot were in the warehouse. She was sewing on some red plush\ncushions for the cabin of the _Aagot_--doll cushions, one would\nalmost think, they were so small. Irgens put his cheek to one of them,\nclosed his eyes, and said, \"Good night, good night.\"\n",
                "\"So you are going to the Art Exhibition!\" said Ole smilingly. \"Aagot has\nhardly spoken about anything else all day.\"\n",

                "It was the promenade-hour. Irgens proposed that they take the way through\nthe park; they could then hear a little music at the same time. Did she\nlike music?\n",
                "Aagot was in a dark suit and wore a cape with red silk lining. The\nsnug-fitting garment clung to her body without a wrinkle; around her neck\nshe simply wore a bit of lace. The cape fluttered at times with scarlet\nsilken flashes. She was sorry to say that she was not very musical. She\nliked to hear music, of course, but she lacked a thorough understanding of\nit.\n",
                "\"Exactly like myself,\" answered Irgens. \"That is funny; are you like that,\ntoo? To tell the truth, I understand music unpardonably poorly, but I show\nup in the park every day; it would never do to stay away.\" Much depended\nupon that; if one did not show oneself and keep abreast of the procession,\none would soon be lost, submerged, forgotten.\n",
                "\"Can one be forgotten so easily?\" she asked. \"But that does not apply to\nyou, surely.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, yes, to me as well as to the rest,\" he replied. \"Why shouldn't I be\nforgotten?\"\n",
                "She answered quite simply:\n",
                "\"I thought you were too well known.\"\n",
                "\"Known? Oh, as to that, Lord help us! I may not be so entirely unknown, of\ncourse, but--You must not think it is an easy matter to keep one's head\nabove water here; one friend is envious, another hateful and malicious, a\nthird simply despicable. No; as far as _that_ is concerned--\"\n",
                "\"It seems to me, however, that you are known, and well known, too,\" she\nsaid. \"We cannot walk two steps that somebody isn't whispering about you;\nI have noticed it all along.\" She stopped.\n",
                "\"No, it is unbearable; I just heard another remark! Rather let us go up to\nthe Exhibition at once!\"\n",
                "He laughed heartily, greatly flattered. How charming she was in her naive\nand unspoiled way! He said: Never mind; keep on! Pay no attention\nwhatever. One got used to this whispering; if it amused people, what of\nit? He himself never noticed it any more; honestly, it did not affect him\nin the least. Besides, he wanted to let her know that to-day _he_ was\nnot the only subject of conversation--what about her? She could believe\nhim or not; she was being thoroughly discussed. One could not come to a\ncity like this one and look as she did without attracting attention; she\ncould be very sure of that.\n",
                "It was not his intention to flatter her; he was sincere in what he said.\nStill she did not seem to believe him.\n",
                "They walked toward the park, where the band thundered Cherubini's\n\"Overture to the Water-Carrier\" across the place.\n",
                "\"It seems to me this is an altogether unnecessary noise,\" he said\nsmilingly.\n",
                "She laughed; she laughed often and heartily over his remarks. This\nlaughter from her fresh lips, the dimple in her left cheek, her many cute\nand childlike ways, drove his spirits still higher; even her nose, which\nwas somewhat irregular in profile and a little too large, made him almost\nfeel as if he were in love. Greek or Roman noses were not always the most\nbeautiful--not at all; it depended on the rest of the face. There was no\nsuch a thing as an authorised standard for noses.\n",
                "He chatted about one thing after another and made time fly; he proved\nhimself the poet who could interest those he addressed himself to, the\nhighly cultured man, the genius of scintillating words. Aagot listened\nattentively; he tried to amuse her and came back to the subject of music\nagain, to operatic music, which he simply abominated. He had, for\ninstance, never been to the opera that he didn't happen to get a seat\nright behind a lady with a sharply bulging corset line, and he was\ncondemned to stare at this ghastly back during three, four long\nintermissions. Then there was the performance itself, the brass\ninstruments close to the ear, and then the singers who tried with all\ntheir might to drown their blatant blare in a roar of noise. At first one\nwould appear who made strange contortions and meanwhile produced song;\nthen another would stalk forth who did not want to take a back seat\neither, and who likewise did his utmost; then a third, a fourth, men and\nwomen, long processions, an army; and all sang their questions and sang\ntheir answers and beat their arms in the air and rolled their eyes,\nexercising their vocal chords without a moment's pause. Wasn't it true?\nThey wept to music, sobbed to music, gritted teeth, sneezed, and fainted\nto music, and the conductor urged them on frantically with an ivory\nhammer-handle. She might laugh, but it was just that way. Then all of a\nsudden the conductor appears to become terror-stricken because of that\ninfernal noise he has inspired; he swings his hammer-handle as a sign that\nthere must be a change. Now the chorus starts in. This is not so bad; the\nchorus can pass muster; at least, it does not use such heartrending\ngestures. But in the midst of the singing another person strides forth,\nand he spoils the whole thing again; ah! it is the Prince; he has a solo--\nand when a prince has a solo of course everybody else has to keep still.\nBut imagine this more or less corpulent masculine person standing there,\nbellowing, with legs wide apart! One gets furious; one experiences a\nwell-nigh irrepressible desire to yell to this fellow to get out, to stop\nspoiling the evening for those who wanted to hear some music--hear the\nchorus sing!\n",
                "Irgens was not displeased with himself--he attained his object. Aagot\nlaughed incessantly and was hugely amused. How he did make things\ninteresting and give life and colour to the most commonplace!\n",
                "They finally got to the Exhibition, looked at what there was to see, and\ntalked about the pictures as they went along. Aagot's questions were fully\nanswered; Irgens knew everything and even told her anecdotes about the\nexhibiting painters. Here, too, they met curious people, who put their\nheads together and looked after them when they passed; but Irgens hardly\nglanced to the left or right; he seemed entirely indifferent to the\nattention accorded him. He only bowed a couple of times.\n",
                "When, after an hour or so, they started to leave, they did not notice in\nan obscure corner a greyish-bearded, somewhat bald person, nor did they\nperceive two fathomless, burning eyes that followed them as they departed.\n",
                "On the street Irgens said:\n",
                "\"I wonder--You are not going home at once, I hope?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am going right back.\"\n",
                "He asked her several times to stay a little longer, but Aagot thanked him\nand said that she wanted to get home. There was nothing to be done; she\ncould not be persuaded, and he had to let her have her way. But they could\nmake up for it some other time? There were both museums and galleries she\nought to see; he would gladly act as her guide. She smiled and thanked\nhim.\n",
                "\"I am admiring your walk,\" he said. \"It is the most perfect walk I have\never seen.\"\n",
                "She flushed and looked at him quickly.\n",
                "\"You cannot mean that,\" she said. \"I who have lived in the backwoods all\nmy life.\"\n",
                "\"Well, you may believe me or not, just as you please--You are altogether\nunusual, Miss Lynum, gloriously uncommon; in vain I seek words that would\ndescribe you. Do you know what you remind me of? I have carried this\nimpression around all day. You remind me of the first bird note, the\nearliest warm spring tones--you know what I mean--that surge through the\nheart when the snow is gone and the sun and the birds of passage are here!\nBut that isn't all about you. God help me, I cannot find the words I want,\npoet though I am supposed to be!\"\n",
                "\"But I have never heard anything like it!\" she cried, and laughed\nvivaciously. \"I am supposed to be like all that? I should like to be, that\nmuch is certain. If only it were true!\"\n",
                "\"You have come in here from the blue mountains; you are full of smiles,\"\nhe said. \"For this reason the description should call to mind the wild\nthings--should have a flavour of venison, so to speak. I am not sure,\nthough.\"\n",
                "They were at the warehouse. They stopped and shook hands.\n",
                "\"I am ever so much obliged,\" she said. \"Aren't you coming up? Ole must be\nin the office now.\"\n",
                "\"No, thanks--But listen, Miss Lynum, I would like to come soon and drag\nyou with me to some museum; may I?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she answered hesitatingly. \"That is very kind of you. I'll see--But\nI thank you for your company to-day.\"\n",
                "She went in.\n"

                "Irgens walked up the street. Where should he go now? He might go to\nTivoli; there was plenty of time; in fact, it was much too early; he would\nhave to kill an hour or so first. He felt in his pocket for the envelope;\nhe had money; he might as well go to the Grand.\n",
                "As he entered the door he was hailed by Journalist Gregersen, the literary\nmember of the _Gazette_ staff. Irgens did not like this fellow; he\ndid not care to cultivate his friendship in order to get an item published\nin the paper now and then. Paulsberg had now two days running had a\nparagraph concerning his excursion to Honefos: the first day about his\ngoing, the second about his return; Gregersen had in his usual\naccommodating manner concocted two very excellent little items about this\nexcursion. That such a man could descend to such coarse work! It was said\nthat the fellow was capable of greater things; he would surely blossom\nforth some day; all right, time enough then. Irgens did not care for him\nvery much nowadays.\n",
                "Unwillingly, he walked over to the Journalist's table. Milde was there,\nalso the Attorney and Coldevin, the grey tutor from the country. They were\nwaiting for Paulsberg. They had been discussing the situation again; it\ncommenced to look a little dubious now when several of the leading\nparliamentarians had shown symptoms of vacillation. \"Just as I have told\nyou,\" said Milde, \"it is beginning to be unbearable here!\"\n",
                "Mrs. Grande was not present. Mrs. Liberia stayed at home.\n",
                "The Journalist reported that the talk about crop failures in Russia\nevidently had something in it. It could not be concealed much longer in\nspite of the fact that the correspondent of the London _Times_ had\nbeen sharply contradicted by the Russian press.\n",
                "\"I had a letter from Ojen,\" said Milde. \"It looks as if he were coming\nback soon; he does not appear to enjoy himself out in the woods.\"\n",
                "All these matters did not interest Irgens in the least. He made up his\nmind to get away as soon as he could. Coldevin said nothing, but glanced\nfrom one to another with his sombre eyes. When he had been presented to\nIrgens he had murmured a few words, sat down again and remained silent.\nIrgens looked at him languidly and was silent too. When he had finished\nhis seidel he got up to go.\n",
                "\"Are you leaving us so soon?\"\n",
                "\"Yes; I have got to go home and dress. I am going to Tivoli. See you\nlater.\"\n",

                "\"There you see the famous Irgens,\" said the Attorney to Coldevin.\n",
                "\"Yes, indeed,\" answered Coldevin with a smile. \"I see so much greatness\nhere that I am getting altogether bewildered. I saw the Art Exhibition\nto-day--It seems to me that our poets are beginning to pay considerable\nattention to their personal appearance; I have seen a couple of them; they\nare so groomed and patent-leathered--one can hardly say they come\nthundering along with foam-flecked bridles.\"\n",
                "\"Why should they? The fashions have changed, you know.\"\n",
                "\"I suppose so.\"\n",

                "When Paulsberg at last showed up they made room for him with alacrity; the\nJournalist sat close by him and wanted to hear his opinion concerning the\nsituation. What did these events portend--what could be done now?\n",
                "Paulsberg, reserved and taciturn as always, gave a half reply, a\nfragmentary opinion: What could be done? Oh, one had to try to live even\nif a couple of parliamentarians were to fail the cause. All the same, he\nwas going to publish an article soon; it would be worth while observing\nwhat effect that would have. He was going to give it to the traitors good\nand proper.\n",
                "Goodness! Was he going to publish an article? That certainly would put\nmatters right. \"Not too gentle, now, Paulsberg; don't show them any\nconsideration.\"\n",
                "\"I imagine Paulsberg knows exactly how gentle he is going to be,\" said\nMilde reprovingly. \"You can safely leave that to him.\"\n",

                "He was a little offended, but Paulsberg smoothed matters over by saying:\n",
                "\"I thank you for the two notices, Gregersen. It is fortunate for us that\nyou keep an eye on us; otherwise people would entirely forget that we\nwriters existed.\"\n",
                "The Attorney ordered another round.\n",
                "\"I am waiting for my wife,\" said Paulsberg.\n",

                "Coldevin glanced from one to another.\n",
                "\"Indeed,\" he said, \"it is sad.\" A moment later he added: \"Well, one cannot\nsay things are much better out in the country. The struggle to live is\nbitter there, too.\"\n",
                "\"But, so help me, there is a difference between poets and peasants, I\nshould think!\"\n",
                "\"In the country people adjust themselves to the law that the weak must\nperish,\" said Coldevin quietly. \"For instance, people who cannot support a\nwife do not marry. If they do, and if they later on have to rely on others\nto discharge their obligations, then they are disgraced, branded with\nshame.\"\n",
                "Everybody looked at the bald fellow; even Paulsberg snatched his glasses\nthat were hanging on a cord across his breast, looked at him a moment, and\nasked in a stage whisper:\n",
                "\"What in the world--what kind of a phenomenon is that?\"\n",
                "This happy word made the friends smile; Paulsberg was asking what kind of\na phenomenon this was, a phenomenon--he, he! It was not often Paulsberg\nsaid that much. Coldevin looked unconcerned; he did not smile. A pause\nensued.\n",
                "Paulsberg looked out of the window, shivered a little, and murmured:\n",
                "\"Drat it, I cannot get anything accomplished these days; this eternal\nsunshine has played me the scurvy trick of paralysing my imagination. I am\nin the middle of a descriptive passage about a rainy season, a raw and\nchilly milieu, and I cannot get anywhere with it.\" He mumbled maledictions\nabout the weather.\n",
                "The Attorney was incautious enough to remark:\n",
                "\"Why don't you write about the sunshine, then?\"\n",
                "It was not many days since Paulsberg himself, in Milde's studio, had\nbluntly expressed an opinion to the effect that Attorney Grande had showed\nsymptoms of a certain arrogance lately. He was right, the Attorney was\nbecoming a little impertinent; it might be well to put him in his place\nonce and for all.\n",
                "\"You talk according to your lights!\" said the Journalist oracularly.\n",
                "This reproach was received in silence; but shortly afterward Grande got up\nand buttoned his coat.\n",
                "\"I don't suppose any of you are going my way?\" he asked in order not to\nshow any ill feeling. And as nobody answered he paid his check, said\ngoodbye and left.\n",
                "More drinks were ordered. Mrs. Paulsberg arrived in the company of Ole and\nhis fianc\u00e9e. Coldevin moved as far back as he could until he found himself\nalmost at another table.\n",
                "\"We had to accompany Mrs. Paulsberg,\" said Ole good-naturedly; \"we\ncouldn't let her go alone.\" And he slapped Paulsberg on the shoulder.\n",
                "Miss Aagot had let a joyous exclamation escape her and had walked straight\nover to Coldevin, to whom she gave her hand. But what in the world had\nbecome of him? Hadn't she kept a continuous lookout for him on the streets\nand asked Ole about him every day? She was at a loss to understand why she\nsaw him so rarely. She had had another letter from home, and everybody\nsent him their kindest regards. Why did he keep so entirely to himself?\n",
                "Coldevin stuttered many brief replies: there was no end of things to see\nand do, exhibitions and museums, Tivoli and Parliament; there were\nnewspapers to read, lectures to attend; he also had to look up a few old\nfriends. Furthermore, it was best not to disturb a newly engaged couple\ntoo much.\n",
                "Coldevin smiled archly; his lips trembled a little and he spoke with bowed\nhead.\n",
                "Ole came over, overwhelmed him with the same reproaches, and received the\nsame excuses. Coldevin was going to call on them to-morrow, though, they\ncould rely on it; he had made up his mind before he met them. Provided he\nwould not disturb them, of course.\n",
                "Disturb? He? What was he thinking of?\n",
                "Beer was served and everybody talked. Mrs. Paulsberg crossed her legs and\ngripped the glass in her masculine fashion. The Journalist monopolised her\nimmediately. Ole continued his conversation with Coldevin.\n",
                "\"I hope you are enjoying yourself here? Interesting people, these! There\nis Lars Paulsberg; have you met him?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I have met him. He is the third one of our authors I have met. No\ndoubt it is my fault; but, to tell the truth, none of them have made an\noverwhelming impression on me.\"\n",
                "\"No? That is because you do not know them well enough.\"\n",
                "\"But I know what they have written. It seems to me they do not exactly\nsoar to the solitary heights. It is probably my own fault, though--Lars\nPaulsberg uses perfumes.\"\n",
                "\"Does he? A little peculiarity. One must pardon such men a few oddities.\"\n",
                "\"But I notice that they treat each other with the greatest respect,\"\nColdevin continued. \"They talk about everything; they make excellent\nspeeches on every subject imaginable.\"\n",
                "\"Don't they, though? It is wonderful to listen to them, I must say.\"\n",
                "\"But how are you getting on--in the business, I mean?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, we take one day at a time. We have just turned a little trick in\nBrazil which I hope will prove satisfactory. I remember, you are\ninterested in business matters. When you come down tomorrow I will take\nyou around and show you how we do it. We will all go--you and Aagot and\nmyself--we three old friends.\"\n",
                "\"I thought I heard my name?\" said Aagot merrily and joined them. \"Yes, I\ndid; don't try to fool me, Ole. It seems to me it is my turn to speak a\nlittle with Coldevin; you have had him to yourself long enough, Ole.\"\n",
                "And she took Ole's chair and sat down.\n",
                "\"The letters from home are full of questions about you. Mamma asked me to\nsee that you were comfortable at your hotel.\"\n",
                "Coldevin's lips quivered again, and he said, with his eyes on the floor:\n",
                "\"How can you bother with such things now? Don't worry about me; I am very\ncomfortable. I hope you are enjoying yourself? Though I hardly need to ask\nyou that.\"\n",
                "\"But, do you know, there are times when I am longing for home, too. Can\nyou understand that?\"\n",
                "\"That is only the first few days--It will be a little hard never to see\nyou again, Miss Aagot--I mean a little--that is--\"\n",
                "\"You talk so strangely to-night,\" she said. \"You almost make me want to\ncry; honestly you do.\"\n",
                "\"But, dear Miss Aagot--\"\n",
                "\"To get married isn't the same as to die, I'm sure.\"\n",
                "Coldevin's manner instantly changed; he became jocular.\n",
                "\"Die! Well, I like that! But you are right in saying that I have been\nsitting here and depressing you with my talk. It was mostly your mother I\nwas thinking of. It was nobody else--Tell me, have you finished the\ncushions for the yacht?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" answered Aagot absently.\n",
                "\"But you have not been in Parliament yet? I imagine you have hardly had\ntime for that as yet. I have been there every day; but then I haven't\nanything else to do.\"\n",
                "\"Listen,\" she said suddenly; \"I may not have an opportunity to bid you\ngood night later, so I will do it now.\" She gave him her hand. \"And\nremember, you have promised to call to-morrow! I--You will make me very\nhappy if you come.\"\n",
                "She dropped his hand and got up.\n",
                "He sat there a moment as in a trance. He heard somebody say: \"What can\nMiss Aagot and Coldevin be so deeply absorbed in?\" He heard that Aagot\nwas on the point of answering, and he exclaimed hurriedly:\n",
                "\"I shake hands with Miss Aagot on a promise to call on her to-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"Be sure and keep your promise, now,\" he heard Ole say. \"Well, Aagot, I\nsuppose we ought to be getting home.\"\n",
                "Ole put his hand in his pocket to pay the waiter; the Journalist did the\nsame, but Milde seized his arm and said:\n",
                "\"Leave that to Ole Henriksen. Kindly pay for us, too, Ole.\"\n",
                "\"With pleasure.\"\n",
                "At the door Lars Paulsberg caught up with him and said:\n",
                "\"Don't go away without giving me the opportunity of shaking hands with\nyou. I hear you could lend me these rotten crowns.\"\n",
                "Ole and Aagot went. A little later Coldevin got up, too; he bowed to each\nof the clique and departed. He heard laughter behind his back and the word\n\"phenomenon\" several times. He hurried into the first gateway he passed\nand took out from his pocketbook a little silken bow, in the Norwegian\ncolours, carefully wrapped in paper. He kissed the bow, looked at it a\nlong time, and kissed it again, trembling in the grip of a silent, deep\nemotion.\n"

                "It was Ole Henriksen's habit to make his rounds through the business\nestablishment immediately after his early morning coffee. He was an early\nriser and had usually accomplished a great deal before breakfast,\ninspected store and cellars, read and answered mail, telegraphed, given\ninstructions to his clerks; everything devolved upon him. Aagot kept him\ncompany nowadays; she insisted on getting up as early as he, and her\nlittle hands lightened many a task for him. Ole Henriksen worked more\nenthusiastically than ever. The old man did nothing nowadays but make out\nan occasional bill and balance up the cash-book; he kept to himself\nup-stairs most of the time, and spent many an hour in the company of some\nold crony, some visiting ship's captain or business acquaintance. But\nbefore retiring old Henriksen always lit a lamp, shambled down-stairs to\nthe office, and took a last survey of the books. He took his time; and\nwhen he came up about midnight he retired immediately.\n",

Aagot did not\ndisturb him much; it was only down in the little warehouse office that she\nwas apt to delay him at times. Her youth and gaiety filled the little\nroom, glorified everything, and brightened the world.\n",
                "She was so cheerful that she carried away even the phlegmatic Ole. He was\nlost in her; he played little tricks on her and trembled with the\ntenderest affection for this hoydenish girl who wasn't even full grown.\nWhen in the company of others he appeared vastly superior--she was his\nlittle sweetheart; she was so young, much younger than he, it was up to\nhim to display his knowledge and experience. But when they were alone,\nalas! then he could not keep up this pretence; he lost his seriousness and\nwas a child with her. He stole many a glance from his books and papers,\ngazed at her secretly, lost in contemplation of her radiant figure and\nworshipping to distraction her dimpling smile. How she could make his\nheart pound when she would glance archly at him and then come over to him\nand whisper: \"So you are _my_ boy, are you?\" She had so many adorable\nways. At times she could sit and gaze at the floor, gaze fixedly at\nsomething which made her eyes dewy--memories, perhaps--some old memory--\n",
                "Ole asked her at last when she thought they ought to get married, and when\nhe saw her blush deeply, even to her neck, he regretted that he had been\ntoo abrupt. There was no hurry; she must decide that herself; no need to\nanswer now, not at all.\n",
                "But she answered:\n",

                "\"Look, he is getting mad, furious, ha, ha, ha! I fooled you that time,\nIrgens!\"\n",
                "Aagot got her hat and coat and went with Irgens. Ole called after her:\n",
                "\"Don't stay too late, Aagot! Remember, we have promised to go with\nTidemand to Tivoli.\"\n",
                "On the street Irgens glanced at his watch and said:\n",
                "\"I see it is a little too early yet. If you have no objections we might\ntake a walk up toward the Castle.\"\n",
                "And they walked toward the Castle. The band played; people strolled up and\ndown. Irgens talked again interestingly and facetiously about different\nmatters, and Aagot replied and laughed, listening curiously to his words;\nat times she would make some admiring little exclamation when he made a\nspecially striking remark. She could not refrain from looking at his\nface--a handsome face, rich, curly moustache, a somewhat broad, voluptuous\nmouth. He was in an entirely new suit to-day; she noticed it was bluish\nlike her own. He wore a silk shirt and grey gloves.\n",
                "As they passed Our Saviour's Church he asked her if she liked to go to\nchurch. She said yes--didn't he?\n",
                "\"Oh, no, not very often.\"\n",
                "That was not nice of him.\n",
                "He bowed smilingly. If she said so, of course. The fact of the matter was\nthat he had received a rude shock once; it sounded silly, it was only a\nbagatelle, but it proved of far-reaching effect. He was sitting in this\nvery church on an occasion; a high mass was being celebrated. The minister\nwas all right; he was doing splendidly. He was even eloquent; he spoke\nconvincingly, with feeling and pathos. But in the middle of a most\nstirring peroration in which he, carried away in an outburst of spiritual\nfervour, had meant to shout: \"Jews and Gentiles!\" his tongue had tripped\nand he had said: \"Gents and Jewtiles! _Gents and Jewtiles!_--Imagine\nthese silly words hurled over the heads of the congregation in a loud,\nsonorous voice! And the poor fellow stood there in full daylight and could\nnot get away from his miserable blunder. I assure you, it shocked me like\na cold shower!\"\n",
                "It sounded genuine as he spoke, not at all like an episode invented for\nthe occasion. Was it not possible that a particularly sensitive soul could\nbe seriously shaken by such a grotesque and silly mishap? Aagot could very\nwell understand it; and at the same time she had to laugh over that\nmiserable \"Gents and Jewtiles,\" which she repeated over and over.\n",
                "When they passed the Parliament buildings, Irgens pointed to the greystone\ncolossus and said:\n",
                "\"There we have Parliament; have you been there yet?\"\n",
                "\"No, not yet.\"\n",
                "Well, it wasn't a very cheerful place just now--wavering and treason all\nalong the line! The doughty parliamentarians lolled in their chairs and\nchewed tobacco and grew fat and lazy; they used sonorous phrases and\nchallenged Sweden to a fight with bare knuckles, but when time for action\ncame--where were they then? She had no idea how he and others were boiling\nwith indignation over this display of loathsome cowardice. And what was\nthe mighty adversary like? Sweden! That invincible world power full of\ndoddering senility! He must compare Sweden to an octogenarian who sat,\ndead drunk and feeble, and boasted of his warlike temper: \"I'll never\nyield--never!\" And when Parliament heard that quavering voice it grew\npalsied with fear. No, he, Irgens, should have been in Parliament!\n",
                "How manly and proudly he spoke! She looked at him and said: \"How zealous\nyou are now!\"\n",
                "\"You must pardon me; I always grow impatient when our sovereignty is\ndiscussed,\" he replied. \"I trust I haven't unwittingly offended you by\ntrespassing on your personal opinions? I am glad to hear that.\"\n",
                "They reached the Castle, turned aside, and entered the park; they forgot\nthat time was passing. He had started in to tell her a story from the\nday's news, a scene from one of the courts: A man was being tried for\nmurder and had confessed. The question of mitigating circumstances arose,\nand it was decided that there were mitigating circumstances. All right;\npenitentiary for life. \"Next case!\" Suddenly a voice is heard from among\nthe spectators; it is the murderer's sweetheart, who shouts: \"His\nconfession is untrue; he has not committed murder! How could he possibly\nhave done it; no one who knows him will believe it! And there are\nmitigating circumstances; you cannot sentence him, for it wasn't\npremeditated murder! No, Henry is innocent! Won't any of you who know him\nsay that he is innocent? Why are you all silent?\" And the lady was led out\nof the courtroom. That was love!\n",
                "Aagot, the little goose, was moved. How beautiful--sad and beautiful! And\nthey carried her out? What a tragedy!\n",
                "\"Well, probably the story is a little exaggerated,\" he said. \"Love as\nstrong as that does not grow on the bushes nowadays.\"\n",
                "\"But it does exist!\"\n",
                "\"Perhaps, somewhere--on the Isle of the Blest--\" But this expression awoke\nthe poet in him, and he rhapsodised. \"And the place was called Evenrest,\nbecause it was green and silent when the two arrived. A boy and a girl;\nshe fair, bright, shining like a white pinion against him who was dark--\ntwo souls who gazed smilingly into each other, who voicelessly implored\neach other, who closed rapturously around each other. And blue mountains\nlooked at them--\"\n",
                "He paused abruptly.\n",
                "\"I am making myself ridiculous,\" he said. \"Let us sit down awhile.\"\n",
                "They sat down. The sun sank, sank deeper; a tower-clock in the city\nsomewhere boomed forth the hour. Irgens continued to speak, impressively,\ndreamily, warmly. He might go into the solitudes this summer, he said;\nsettle down in a cabin by the water and row around at night. Imagine,\nwonderful nights in a rowboat!... But he had a feeling now that Aagot was\nbeginning to be uneasy because of the lateness of the hour, and in order\nto keep her mind occupied he said:\n",
                "\"You must not believe, Miss Lynum, that I go around and prate about blue\nmountains always; if I do it now it is only because of you. You impress me\ndeeply; you enrapture me when you are near me. I know what I am saying. It\nis the loveliness and brightness of your face, and when you tilt your head\nsideways--Of course, this is meant aesthetically, impersonally!\"\n",
                "Aagot had given him a quick glance, and this made him add the last words.\nShe did not understand him, perhaps; the reason for this last remark was\nnot quite clear to her, and she was on the point of saying something when\nhe resumed laughingly:\n",
                "\"I sincerely trust I haven't bored you too much with my nonsense? If I\nhave I'll go right down to the harbour and drown myself. Yes, you laugh,\nbut--I want to tell you, though, that your displeasure was charmingly\nbecoming to you, really. I saw that you were provoked. If I may be allowed\nto express myself aesthetically once more, I would say that for a moment\nyou looked as the slender, wild fawn must look when she lifts her head and\nsnorts.\"\n",
                "\"But now I want to tell _you_ something,\" she said and got up. \"What\ntime is it? But you must be crazy! Let us be off at once! If it is my\nfault that you have talked too much, it is certainly yours that I have\nlistened to you and forgotten the time entirely. This is awful!\"\n",
                "And they hurried away down the park slope.\n",
                "As they were going to turn toward the museum he wondered if there would be\ntime for a visit to-day. Perhaps they had better wait until some other\ntime? What did she think?\n",
                "She stopped and reflected a moment; then she laughed merrily and\nexclaimed:\n",
                "\"But we will have to go, if only for a moment! We must be able to say that\nwe have been there. No, this is simply terrible!\"\n",
                "And they hurried along.\n",
                "The fact that she was conspiring with him to hide this peccadillo, that\nfrom now on they would have a sort of secret together, filled him with a\nwarm pleasure. He wanted to keep on talking, to continue to keep her\ninterested; but she did not listen; she hurried along in order to get to\nthe museum before it should close. She skipped quickly up the many stairs,\nran past people going out, glanced quickly right and left in order to\nidentify the chief works of art, and asked breathlessly: \"Where is the\nLaoco\u00f6n Group? Quick! I must see that!\" They ran off in a wild search for\nthe Laoco\u00f6n Group. It turned out that they had at least ten minutes before\nclosing time, and they took things a little easier.\n",
                "Suddenly she imagined seeing Coldevin's dark eyes peering out from a\ncorner; but as she took a step forward to look closer the eyes disappeared\nand she forgot all about it.\n",
                "\"What a pity we are in such a hurry!\" she said several times.\n",
                "When they had rushed through the first floor their time was up and they\nhad to leave. She talked with Irgens on the way back and seemed as pleased\nas before; she gave him her hand at the door and thanked him, thanked him\ntwice. He begged her forgiveness because he had been responsible for her\nfailure to view the sculptures thoroughly, and she smiled amiably and said\nthat she had had a good time.\n",
                "\"I shall see you later at Tivoli,\" said Irgens.\n",
                "\"Are you going there?\" she asked in surprise.\n",
                "\"I have been asked to come; I am going with some friends.\"\n",
                "Aagot did not know that Irgens had received a pressing invitation from\nMrs. Hanka; she said all right, nodded, and went in.\n",
                "Ole was waiting for her; she threw herself on his neck and cried eagerly:\n",
                "\"It was glorious--the Laoco\u00f6n Group--everything! We did not have time to\nsee everything, that is, to see everything carefully; but you will take me\nthere some time, won't you? Promise! For I want you to take me.\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "When later on Ole and Aagot were going to Tidemand's house on their way to\nTivoli, Aagot remarked casually:\n",
                "\"It is a pity that you are not a poet, Ole.\"\n",
                "He looked at her in surprise. \"Do you think so?\" he asked.\n",
                "Then suddenly it dawned on her what a tactless thing she had said. As a\nmatter of fact, she had not meant it at all; it was just a thoughtless\nword, a thoughtless, thoughtless word. She repented it bitterly and would\nhave given anything to have it unsaid. She stopped, threw her arms around\nOle's neck right in the middle of the street, and said in agitation:\n",
                "\"And you believe it? It is easy to fool you, Ole! Listen--you don't for a\nmoment think--I swear I didn't mean it, Ole. It was so stupid of me to say\nit, but I didn't for a moment think you would take it seriously. I want to\nknow if you think I meant it; tell me if you do?\"\n",
                "\"Of course I don't,\" he said and patted her cheek; \"not at all, dearest.\nThat you can make so much of a little thing like that, you foolish child!\nHe, he!\"\n",
                "They continued their interrupted walk. She was so grateful to him because\nhe had taken it so nicely. Oh, he was so good and considerate, she loved\nhim; Heavens! how she adored him....\n",
                "But this little scene had its influence over her conduct all during the\nevening.\n"

The\nentire clique was there, even Mr. and Mrs. Paulsberg; later on Attorney\nGrande appeared, dragging with him Coldevin, who followed unwillingly and\nprotestingly; he wanted to be excused. The Attorney had met him outside\nand had thought it would be fun to bring him along.\n",
                "Everything under the sun had been discussed: literature and art, man and\nGod; they had settled the suffrage question, taken a fall out of Malthus,\nstrayed onto the political preserves. It had unfortunately turned out that\nPaulsberg's article in the _Gazette_ failed to have the desired\neffect on Parliament. With sixty-five votes to forty-four it had decided\nto postpone matters indefinitely; five representatives had suddenly been\ntaken ill and could not participate in the voting. Milde declared that he\nwas going to Australia.\n",

                "It was, however, a secret arrangement that the picture was not to be\nfinished until after the close of the Exhibition. Paulsberg had expressly\ndemanded it. He did not want to be exhibited in mixed company; he desired\nsolitude, veneration, a large window all to himself on the promenade. This\nwas just like Paulsberg.\n",
                "When, therefore, Milde said that he could finish the picture in a couple\nof days, Paulsberg answered curtly:\n",

                "Mrs. Hanka was again in her grey woollen dress with low lace collar; her\nneck was bare. Spring seemed to affect her; she looked a little played\nout. Her lips were cracked, and when she laughed her features were\ndistorted into wry grimaces because of these cracked lips.\n",
                "She told Aagot that they were going to the country shortly and hoped to\nsee her there. They were going to eat currants and rake hay and loll in\nthe grass. Suddenly she turned to her husband across the table and said:\n",

He seemed somewhat changed since his arrival; he answered boldly\nwhen he was addressed, and was not backward in expressing his opinions.\nJournalist Gregersen spoke again about the political situation. He had not\nheard Paulsberg say anything about it. What was going to happen? What were\nthey going to do?\n",
                "\"What can one do about an accomplished fact?\" asked Paulsberg. \"Simply\ntake it like men; that is all I can say.\"\n",

                "The discussion grew violent. Milde and the Journalist simultaneously\ndemanded the dismissal of the cabinet; others expressed their opinion\nabout the Swedish opera they had just attended; it appeared that not one\namong them understood music in the least, and they strayed back to\npolitics.\n",
                "\"So you were not seriously shaken by what occurred to-day, Mr. Coldevin?\"\nasked Paulsberg in order to be friendly, too. \"I am ashamed to confess\nthat I have sat at home and cursed all afternoon!\"\n",

                "\"Shaken? One can, of course, not avoid feeling disappointed when such\nthings happen. But the climax to-day was hardly unexpected by me. As I see\nit, it was only a last rite.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, you are a pessimist.\"\n",
                "\"Indeed, no, you are mistaken. I am not that.\"\n",
                "Beer and sandwiches were served, afterward coffee. Coldevin glanced at\nthose present; he met Aagot's eyes looking at him very gently, and this\nagitated him so that he suddenly spoke out loudly what was on his mind:\n",
                "\"Did this decision to-day surprise you so very much, then?\" And when he\nreceived a qualified affirmation he continued, in order to make himself\nunderstood: \"To me it appears to be entirely in harmony with conditions\notherwise prevailing.--People are saying to themselves: 'We have our\nliberty; the constitution guarantees it, and now we want to enjoy it for a\nwhile!' Behold--the sons of Norway have become freemen and the peers of\nanybody.\"\n",
                "Everybody agreed with him. Paulsberg nodded; this phenomenon from the\ncountry might not be entirely impossible, after all. But he would say no\nmore; he preserved an obstinate silence. At last the Attorney got him\nstarted again; he asked:\n",
                "\"When I met you at the Grand recently you insisted that it was wrong ever\nto forget, ever to forgive. Is that a principle, or how--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, you who are young should remember, should always remember, the\ndisappointment you have suffered to-day. You have put your faith in a man,\nand the man has betrayed your confidence; this you should never forget.\nOne should never forgive, never; such wrongs should be avenged. Once I saw\ntwo truck-horses maltreated; it was in a Catholic country, in France. The\ndriver sat high in his seat and swung his enormous whip; it was of no use,\nthe horses slipped and could not budge the heavy load, even though they,\nso to speak, dug their hoofs into the asphalt. The driver got down; he\nturned his whip around and used the handle; he beat the horses across\ntheir backs; they tried again, stumbled and fell, got up and made another\neffort. The driver became more and more enraged as people gathered around\nand witnessed his dilemma; he went forward and beat the horses across the\neyes; he went back and struck them on the tender spots beneath the flanks,\nand the horses squirmed and stumbled, and fell to their knees again, as if\nthey begged for mercy--Three times I tried to get at that brute, and every\ntime I was pushed back by the railing mob who wanted no interference. I\nhad no gun; I was helpless; I stood there with a penknife in my hands and\ncursed and swore to high Heaven at that barbaric beast. Then somebody next\nto me--a woman, a nun who carried on her breast the cross of Christ--said\nmildly and reproachfully: 'You are committing an awful sin, sir; the Lord\nis good; he forgives everything!' I turned to that unspeakably brutal\ncreature and said nothing, but glared at her and happened to spit in her\nface--\"\n",
                "This delighted the clique.\n",
                "\"In the face? How did it turn out? The devil you say! Did you get away\nwith it?\"\n",
                "\"No; I was arrested--But what I wanted to say is this: Never forgive; it\nis brutal; it turns justice into a farce. A kind act should be repaid with\na still kinder act, but a wicked wrong should be avenged. If one is struck\non one cheek and turns the other in forgiveness and submission, then\ngoodness and justice lose all value. I wish to point out that the\nresult in Parliament to-day is not altogether an illogical consequence\nof the conditions that have developed among us. We forgive and forget\ntreason in our leaders and excuse their vacillation and weakness in every\ncrisis. Now the youthful element should step forward, the young Norway,\ninvincible in its indignation and irresistible in its strength. But the\nyoung Norway does not step forward; indeed no, we have mollycoddled it\nwith hymns and rot about peace eternal; we have taught it to admire\ngentleness and submissiveness; above all, to emulate those who have\nreached the highest degree of neutral toothlessness. Behold the country's\nyouth, strapping and full-grown, six foot tall, sucking its bottle and\ngrowing fat and harmless. If some one smites it on one cheek it turns the\nother accommodatingly, and keeps its fists in its pockets with admirable\nself-control.\"\n",
                "Coldevin's speech attracted not a little attention; they all looked\nclosely at him. He sat there as usual and spoke quietly, without\nexcitement. But his eyes blazed, and his hands trembled as he awkwardly\nbent back his fingers until they cracked. He did not lift his voice above\nthe normal. Otherwise he did not look well; he wore a loose shirt-front,\nand this had become disarranged and hung lopsidedly so that one could\nglimpse a blue cotton shirt beneath. His beard straggled down his breast.\n",
                "The Journalist nodded and remarked to his neighbour:\n",
                "\"Not at all bad! He is almost one of us.\"\n",
                "Lars Paulsberg said jestingly, and still amiably:\n",
                "\"As I said before, I have done nothing but curse all day, so I guess I\nhave contributed considerably to the indignation of our youth.\"\n",
                "Attorney Grande, who enjoyed himself immensely, was quite proud over his\nidea of getting Coldevin to come. He told Milde once more how it had\nhappened: \"I thought it would not be very lively here, and just then I ran\nacross this fellow outside, standing there all by himself looking in. It\nkind of moved me, you know--\"\n",
                "Milde spoke up.\n",
                "\"You mentioned the conditions now prevailing. If by that you mean that we\nare entirely surrounded by weakness and submissiveness, let me inform you\nthat you are much mistaken--\"\n",
                "\"In that case I do not mean it, of course.\"\n",
                "\"But what do you mean, then? You cannot say that youth like ours, teeming\nwith talent and genius, is weak and of no account. Good God, man! there\nnever was a time when our youth was as rich in talent as at present.\"\n",
                "\"If there was, then I never heard of it,\" said even Norem, who had been\nsitting quietly at a corner of the table emptying glass upon glass.\n",
                "\"Talent? Now that is an entirely different question, you know,\" said\nColdevin quietly. \"But do you really think that the talents within our\nyouth are so sweepingly great?\"\n",
                "\"He--he asks if--So our talents at present do not amount to so very much,\nMr. Coldevin?\" Milde laughed contemptuously and turned to Irgens, who had\nkept aloof from the conversation. \"It looks bad for us, Irgens; the\nphenomenon does not approve of us.\"\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka now spoke; she wanted to smooth matters over. It could only be\na misunderstanding; Mr. Coldevin would surely explain himself\nsatisfactorily. Couldn't they listen to a man without losing their temper?\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Milde--\"\n",
                "\"You are not much impressed with us who are supposed to have a little\ntalent, then?\" asked Paulsberg, still indulgent.\n",
                "\"Impressed? I must admit that in my humble opinion things are a little on\nthe down grade with us,\" answered Coldevin. \"I confess that that is my\nopinion. And it is especially the country's youth I am thinking of. We\nhave begun a slow retrogression; in plain words, we are lowering our\nstandards, we are tapering down to a general zero. The young do not demand\nmuch from themselves or from others any more; they accept the diminutive\nand call it great; there is not much, not very much, needed to create a\nstir nowadays. That is what I meant when I referred to the general\nconditions.\"\n",
                "\"But, good Lord! what do you think of our younger writers, then?\" cried\nJournalist Gregersen, flushed and angry. \"Our poets, yes! Have you read\nany of them? Have you, for instance, ever come across the name of\nPaulsberg, the name of Irgens?\"\n",
                "Aagot could not refrain from observing her old tutor. She was surprised to\nnote that this man, who invariably used to yield when he was contradicted,\nnow sat there with a ready reply to every remark and did not look very\ntimid either.\n",
                "\"You must not take offence at what I say,\" he begged. \"I admit that I have\nno business to express such opinions here; I ought to leave that to others\nwho understand these matters better than I; but if you want to know what I\nthink, then I must say that, according to my lights, our younger writers\ndo not seem to improve the conditions greatly. Of course, there can be no\nfixed standard; everything depends on the point of view, and yours is not\nmine; we are bound to differ. But, anyway, our younger writers do not lift\nthe level greatly; hardly, according to my understanding. It would seem\nthey lack the ability. Of course, that is no fault of theirs; but then\nthey have no right to pose as being greater than they are. It is a pity\nthat we lose sight of the greater and make mediocrity take its place. Look\nat our youth; look at our authors; they are very clever, but--Yes, they\nare both clever and industrious; they labour and toil, _but they lack\nthe spark_. Good God, how far they are from squandering their\ntreasures! They are saving and calculating and prudent. They write a few\nverses and they print these few verses. They squeeze out a book now and\nthen; they delve into their inmost recesses and conscientiously scrape the\nbottom until they arrive at a satisfactory result. They do not scatter\nvalues broadcast; no, they do not fling gold along the highways. In former\ndays our poets could afford to be extravagant; there was wealth untold;\nthey towered rich and care-free and squandered their treasures with\nglorious unconcern. Why not? There was plenty left. Oh, no, our\npresent-day authors are clever and sensible; they do not show us, as did\nthe old, a flood, a tempest, a red eruption of flame-tongued, primeval\npower!\"\n",
                "Aagot's eyes were on him; he caught her glance of rapt attention, and she\nmade him understand with a warm smile that she had listened to his every\nword. She wanted to show Ole how little she had meant her thoughtless\nregret that he was no poet. She nodded to Coldevin and wished the poets\nall they got. Coldevin was grateful for her smile; she was the only one\nwho smiled at him, and he did not mind the violent interruptions, the\nshouts and rude questions: What kind of a phenomenon was he who could\nassume this superior pose? What world-subduing exploits had he performed?\nHe should not remain incognito any longer; what was his real name? They\nwanted to acclaim him!\n",
                "Irgens was least affected of them all; he twirled his moustache and looked\nat his watch to make everybody understand how this bored him. Glancing at\nColdevin, he whispered to Mrs. Hanka with an expression of disgust:\n",
                "\"It seems to me that this man is a little too untidy. Look at his collar,\nor bib, or whatever one may call it. I noticed that he put his\ncigar-holder in his vest-pocket a moment ago without first putting it in a\ncase. Who knows, there might be an old comb in the same pocket.\"\n",
                "But with his air of undisturbed serenity, with his eyes fixed on a point\nin the table, quietly indifferent, Coldevin listened to the exclamations\nfrom the gentlemen of the party. The Journalist asked him pointblank if he\nwere not ashamed of himself.\n",
                "\"Leave him alone!\" said Paulsberg. \"I don't see why you want to annoy\nhim.\"\n",
                "\"It certainly looks bad for our poor country!\" sneered the Journalist. \"No\ntalents, no youth, nothing only a 'general condition.' He, he! God only\nknows how it will all end! And we who have innocently assumed that a\npeople should honour and respect its young writers!\"\n",
                "Coldevin seized on this.\n",
                "\"Yes, but that is exactly what people are doing; nobody can justly\ncomplain on that score! People respect most highly a man who has written a\nbook or two; he is admired far more, for instance, than the ablest\nbusiness man or the most talented professional! To our people an author\nmeans a great deal; he is the essence of all that is distinguished and\nadmirable. There are probably very few countries in which the intellectual\nlife is dominated by authors to the degree it is here. As you probably\nwill admit, we have no statesmen; but our authors direct our politics, and\nthey do it well. It may have struck you that there are barren spots in our\nscientific attainments; however, with true intuition, our authors are not\nafraid to assume the burden and pose as scientists. It has surely not\nescaped your attention that in all our history we have never produced a\nthinker; never mind, our authors dabble in philosophy, and everybody\nthinks they do it splendidly. It seems highly unjust to complain because\nof a lack of appreciation of and admiration for our authors.\"\n",
                "Paulsberg, who in his works had repeatedly proven himself a thinker and\nphilosopher of rank, sat and toyed with his eye-glass and smiled\nsuperciliously. But when Coldevin added a few words and ended up with\nsaying that he had the greatest hope and faith in the country's practical\nyouth, in its young commercial talents, then a loud laugh greeted him, and\nboth the Journalist and Paulsberg shouted simultaneously that this was\ngreat, by all the saints the best ever, so help me! Commercial talents--\nwhatever could that be? Talents for trading--what? Glory be!\n",
                "\"In my opinion you will find really great talents within the ranks of our\nbusiness youth,\" Coldevin continued undisturbed. \"And I would advise you\nto pay a little attention to them. They are building ships, opening new\nmarkets, carrying on involved business enterprises on a hitherto undreamed\nof scale--\"\n",
                "Coldevin could not be heard; they laughed and shouted, although out of\nrespect for their good friends the business men present they endeavoured\nto change the subject. Ole Henriksen and Tidemand had listened in silence;\nthey were embarrassed and did not know how to take it, but began to speak\ntogether in low voices. Suddenly Tidemand whispered:\n",
                "\"Can I come over and see you to-morrow about a business matter? I would\nlike to come early, about ten, if you have time then? All right; thanks!\"\n",
                "At Milde's corner of the table the discussion had swung to wines--old\nwines, Johannisberger, Cabinet, Musigny. Milde understood the subject\nthoroughly and contradicted the Attorney violently, although Grande, of\nthe well-known Grande family, was supposed to have drunk such wines since\nhe was a child.\n",
                "\"There is no end to your assertiveness lately,\" said Milde.\n",
                "The Attorney glanced at him and muttered:\n",
                "\"Such a bit of an oil-painter will also presume to understand wines!\"\n",
                "Conversation strayed to the government art subsidies. Irgens listened\nwithout changing a feature when Milde asserted that Ojen was the worthiest\napplicant. It was exceedingly generous in Milde to express such views; he\nhimself had applied and needed the money as much as anybody. Irgens could\nhardly understand it.\n",
                "Interest in the preposterous tutor had entirely waned. Nobody spoke to him\nany more; he had got hold of his hat, which he sat and twirled. Mrs. Hanka\naddressed a couple of questions to him in order to be polite, but after\nanswering them he was entirely silent. It was strange that the man did not\nnotice how his shirt-front sagged; the slightest movement would correct\nit. But he did not adjust it.\n",
                "Paulsberg got up to take his leave. Before he went he manoeuvred the\nJournalist into a corner and whispered:\n",
                "\"You might do me the favour to mention that I have about half completed my\nnew book. It might interest people to know I am at it.\"\n",
                "Milde and the Attorney got up next; they awoke Norem, who was dozing after\nall the many glasses he had emptied, and they got him on his legs with\ndifficulty. He began to speak; he had not quite heard the last, the very\nlast of the discussion; how had the poets fared? Oh, there was Mrs. Hanka;\nso pleased to see her. But why had she arrived so late?\n",
                "He was finally led outside.\n",
                "\"This means a general departure, I suppose?\" asked Irgens, displeased. He\nhad tried to approach Miss Lynum once during the evening but without\nsuccess. She had plainly avoided him. He had noticed later on that\nColdevin's foolish remarks about the poets and the youth of the country\nhad amused her inordinately; what could that mean? Altogether it had been\nan unpleasant evening. Mrs. Hanka had sat there with her cracked lips\nunable to smile decently, and Mrs. Paulsberg was impossible. The evening\nwas simply wasted. And now the company was breaking up; no prospects for\nlivening up one's spirits with a little intimate half-hour.\n",
                "Irgens promised to take his revenge on the clique because of the\nindifference it seemed to show him. Perhaps next week....\n",
                "Outside Tivoli the company parted. Mrs. Hanka and Aagot walked together\ndown the street.\n"

                "Tidemand came to H. Henriksen's office at ten the next morning. Ole was\nstanding at his desk.\n",
                "Tidemand's errand was, as he had said, a matter of business only; he spoke\nin a low voice and placed before Ole a telegram couched in mysterious\nwords. Where it said \"Rising One,\" it really meant \"Ten,\" and where it\nsaid \"Baisse U. S.,\" it meant an exportation prohibition on the Black Sea\nand along the Danube, and a rise in America. The telegram was from\nTidemand's agent in Archangel.\n",
                "Ole Henriksen immediately grasped the situation: on account of the Russian\ncrop failure, in connection with the already low supplies, Russia was\npreparing to prohibit all grain exports. Hard times were coming. Norway,\ntoo, would feel the pressure, and grain would soar to incredible prices.\nIt was necessary to get hold of as much as possible at no matter what\nfigure. In spite of official Russian denials of the rumours in English\nnewspapers, it seemed as if America already had scented the danger, for\nAmerican wheat was rising daily. From eighty-seven and eighty-eight it had\nrisen until it now fluctuated between one hundred and ten and one hundred\nand fifteen. Nobody could predict to what heights it would climb.\n",
                "Tidemand's business with Ole was a proposition that the two friends and\ncolleagues join in a speculation in American rye while there still was\ntime. They were to join forces and import a mass of rye that should\nmaterially assist in keeping the country fed during the coming year. But\nit was a matter of urgency; rye, too, was soaring; in Russia it was almost\nunpurchasable.\n",
                "Ole left his desk and began to walk up and down. His mind was working; he\nhad intended to offer Tidemand some refreshment, but forgot it entirely.\nHe was greatly tempted, but he was up to his neck in other pressing\nengagements--that Brazilian affair had almost paralysed him for the\nmoment, and he did not expect to be able to take his profits until early\nsummer.\n",
                "\"There ought to be money in it,\" said Tidemand.\n",
                "No doubt; that was not why Ole hesitated. But he simply was not able to do\nit. He explained his circumstances and added that he was afraid to tackle\nanything more at present. The speculation appealed to him, notwithstanding\nhis inability to participate; his eyes gleamed, and he inquired eagerly\ninto all the details. He took a piece of paper, made estimates, and\nstudied the telegram afresh with a thoughtful air. Finally he declared\nthat he could do nothing.\n",
                "\"Of course I can operate alone,\" said Tidemand. \"I will do it on a smaller\nscale, that is all. But I should have liked you to be in on this; I would\nhave felt safer. I realise that you cannot go further. However, I'll\ntelegraph myself; have you got a blank?\"\n",
                "Tidemand wrote out his telegram and handed it to Ole.\n",
                "\"I guess that is clear enough?\"\n",

                "\"So much?\" he exclaimed. \"This is a big order, Andreas.\"\n",
                "\"It is big. But I hope the results will justify it,\" answered Tidemand\nquietly. And unable to control a feeling that overwhelmed him at the\nmoment, he looked toward the wall and whispered as if to himself: \"I don't\ncare how it turns out or about anything any more.\"\n",
                "Ole looked at him and asked:\n",
                "\"Any news?\"\n",
                "\"No--\"\n",
                "\"Well, we'll see how it turns out.\"\n",

                "\"I should have liked us both to be in this enterprise, Ole. I must confess\nthat I am in deep elsewhere, too, but--I have my ice to realise on. When\nthe warm weather comes I'll make money on that, don't you think?\"\n",
                "\"Decidedly! As good as ready money, ice is.\"\n",
                "\"So I am not altogether on my knees. And may the Lord keep that sad fate\nfrom me, both for my own sake and for the sake of mine!\"\n",
                "\"But could you not as a matter of safety--Wait a moment. Pardon me for not\noffering you a cigar; I know how you like to smoke while talking; I\nforgot. Sit down a moment; I'll be back directly.\"\n",
                "Tidemand knew that Ole was on his way to the cellar for the usual bottle\nof wine, and tried to call him back, but Ole did not hear and returned in\na moment with the old, fuzzy bottle. They sat on the sofa as usual and\ndrank to each other.\n",
                "\"I simply wanted to ask,\" continued Ole, \"are you sure you have considered\neverything in connection with this American affair? I do not flatter\nmyself that I can teach you anything, you know, but--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I fancy I have calculated all contingencies,\" answered Tidemand.\n\"You notice I am using the term 'Delivery within three days.' Success\ndepends on quick action. I haven't even forgotten to consider the effect\nof a possible presidential change in America.\"\n",
                "\"But wouldn't it be safer to place your limit a little closer? Perhaps you\nought not to buy over twelve.\"\n",
                "\"No; that would not be well. For you understand that if Russia closes,\nthen fifteen, or even twenty, is not too much. On the other hand, if she\ndoes not close, then a hundred, yes, ninety, is far too much. In that case\nI am done for.\"\n",
                "They both reflected.\n",
                "\"I believe this enterprise is going to be lucky,\" said Tidemand suddenly.\n\"Really, I feel it. You know what it means when we traders have a\npremonition of this kind.\"\n",
                "\"How are things otherwise?\" asked Ole.\n",
                "\"Well,\" Tidemand answered hurriedly, \"it does not look so bad just now,\nnot at all. Things are very much as usual at home.\"\n",
                "\"No change, then?\"\n",
                "\"Well, no--I must get back now.\"\n",
                "Tidemand got up. Ole followed him to the door and said:\n",

                "The awkward fellow! This was Ole Henriksen's way of stiffening a comrade's\nbackbone.\n",
                "But Tidemand did not go at once; he stood there with his hand on the\ndoor-knob and shifted his eyes nervously from place to place.\n",
                "\"It can hardly be thought strange if I get a little downhearted once in a\nwhile,\" he said. \"Things do not look very bright for me; I do my best to\nfix everything up, but I do not make much headway, not very much, no.\nWell, we'll have to wait and see how matters shape themselves. I think it\nis getting a little better, thank God.\"\n",
                "\"Does your wife keep at home more now? It seems to me that--\"\n",
                "\"Hanka has been a good mother to the children lately. I have been very\nhappy because of that; it has brought us closer together, as it were. She\nis busy fitting the children out for the country. It is wonderful the\nthings she gets together; I have never seen anything like it--blue and\nwhite and red dresses! They are lying home; I look at them whenever I am\nhome. Perhaps I shouldn't place too much faith in it. She does not\nconsider herself married yet, she continues to call herself Lange. That\nmay be only a whim. She calls herself Tidemand, too; she does not forget\nthat. You yourself heard last night in Tivoli how she asked me for a\nhundred. I am glad she does that; I don't mind, and shouldn't have\nmentioned it if you hadn't heard it yourself. But it happened to be the\nthird hundred crowns she had got from me in two days. Don't misunderstand\nme! But why does she ask me for money before people? Isn't that as if she\nwanted to give out the impression that that is the only way to take me,\notherwise she wouldn't get any? She uses a good deal of money; I hardly\nthink she uses it for herself; I am sure she doesn't, for Hanka was never\nextravagant. She must be giving it away; it is her affair if she helps\nsomebody. She gets quite a lot of money from me in a week's time;\nsometimes she gets it when she goes out, and she has nothing left when she\nreturns, although she has bought nothing. Well, that does not matter. As\nlong as I have anything it belongs to her as well as to me; that is only\nright and natural. I asked her jokingly once if she wanted to ruin me--\nmake a beggar out of me. It was only a joke, and I laughed heartily myself\nas I said it. But I shouldn't have said it; she offered to leave the house\nwhenever I wanted her to--in short, divorce. She has told me that often\nenough, but this time simply because of a joke. I said that I was sorry,\nand I asked her pardon; I had never for a moment thought of such a thing\nas that she might ruin me. 'Dear Andreas,' she asked me, 'can we never get\nfree from each other?' I do not know what I answered; I guess there was\nnot much sense to it, for she asked immediately for my key, as she had\nlost her own. I gave it to her, and then she smiled. 'Smile again,' I\nsaid, and she did it for my sake, and said smilingly that I was a big\nbaby. Yesterday morning I didn't see her before I got home from the\noffice. She was still working with the children's summer outfit and showed\nme everything. She took out her handkerchief, and as she pulled it out\nfrom her dress a tie fell out, a gentleman's red tie. I made out that I\ndid not see it; but I knew very well that the tie did not belong to me. I\nknew it only too well. That is--understand me correctly--I did not see it\nwell enough to be sure whom it might belong to. It might even have been\none of my own ties, some old rag I have ceased to use. It is a peculiarity\nof mine never to remember my own ties; I notice them so little, I\nimagine--So things are coming around, as I said. And if my big trade now\nsucceeds, perhaps that will bring luck for us all. It would be fun to show\nher that I am not such a dunce, ha, ha!\"\n",
                "The two friends talked a little further, after which Tidemand went to the\ntelegraph office. He was full of hope. His great idea was to discount the\ncrisis, to hold enormous supplies of grain when nobody else should have\nany. He would succeed! He walked with a springy step, like a youth, and\navoided meeting anybody who might detain him.\n",

This superior soul, who never took anybody\ninto his confidence, had, to the great surprise of everybody, put out a\ncharming volume of poems just when spring was in full blow. Was that not a\nsurprise? True, it was two years since his drama had appeared; but it was\nnow proven that he had not been idle; he had conceived one poem after\nanother, and quietly put them away, and when the heap had grown big enough\nhe had given it to the printer. It was thus a proud man should act; nobody\nexceeded Irgens in strong and warm discretion.\n",
                "His book was exhibited in the bookstore windows; people discussed it and\npredicted it would attract much attention; the ladies were enraptured with\nthe gently glowing love stanzas scattered through it. There were also many\nbold and courageous words, full of manliness and will: poems to Justice,\nto Liberty, to the Kings--God knows he did not spare the kings. But Irgens\nnoticed no more than ever that people admired him when he strolled down\nthe promenade. Gracious! if they enjoyed looking at him, that was their\naffair. He was frigidly indifferent, as ever.\n",
                "\"I must admit you are a foxy fellow!\" exclaimed even Norem, the Actor,\nwhen he ran across him on the street. \"Here you go along quietly and say\nnothing, and all of a sudden you set off a rocket right under our very\nnoses. You are unique!\"\n",
                "The Attorney, however, could not help giving him a little dig; he laughed\nand said: \"But you have enemies, Irgens. I was talking to a man today who\nrefused to see anything gigantic in the publishing of a small volume after\na lapse of nearly two years and a half!\"\n",

                "No, it was not Paulsberg.\n",
                "Irgens made a few more questions and guesses, but the pretentious Attorney\nrefused to betray his critic. He made a secret out of it, and irritated\nIrgens as much as he could. \"It seems you are not so altogether\nindifferent,\" he teased and chuckled gleefully.\n",
                "Irgens murmured contemptuously: \"Nonsense!\" But he was evidently\nconsiderably bothered by this defamer, this jealous fellow who had\ncriticised him, and tried to belittle his exploit. If not Paulsberg, who\nthen? Who among them had done better during the last two and a half years?\nIrgens knew nobody; among the younger writers he was absolutely paramount.\nSuddenly something struck him, and he said indifferently:\n",

A man who carries a cigar-holder and\na dirty comb in the same pocket! Well, I must be going; so long!\"\n",
                "Irgens walked off. If the enemy was this barbarian from the backwoods,\nwell and good! His mind was again relieved; he nodded to acquaintances and\nlooked quite cheerful. He had for a moment felt aggrieved that anybody\nshould be grumbling behind his back, but that was now forgotten; it would\nbe foolish to take offence at this old bushwhacker.\n",
                "Irgens intended to take a walk around the harbour so as to be left in\npeace; this more or less stupid talk about his book had really got on his\nnerves. Were people now beginning to prate about working hours and\nquantity in connection with poetry? In that case his book would be found\nwanting; it was not so very ponderous; it did not outweigh one of\nPaulsberg's novels, thank God!\n",
                "When he reached the harbour he suddenly caught a glimpse of Coldevin's\nhead behind a pile of packing-cases. Irgens noticed the direction of his\nglance, but this told him nothing; the old imbecile was evidently lost in\nsome crazy meditation or other. It was amusing to see him so altogether\nunconscious of his surroundings, standing there agape with his nose in the\nair. His eyes were almost in a direct line with the little office window\nat the end of Henriksen's warehouse; he stared unblinkingly and apparently\nunseeingly at that particular spot. Irgens was on the point of going over\nin order to inquire if he perhaps wanted to see Ole Henriksen; he would\nthen be able to turn the conversation to his book and get the old man to\nexpress an opinion. It would be quite entertaining; the oaf would be\nforced to admit that he valued poetry according to weight. But was it\nworth while? It was really of no account whatever what this person might\nthink. Irgens made a turn across the docks; he looked up--Coldevin had not\nmoved. Irgens sauntered past, crossed the street on his way up-town.\nSuddenly Ole Henriksen and Aagot came out of the warehouse and caught\nsight of him.\n",
                "\"Good day, good day, Irgens!\" called Ole with outstretched hand. \"Glad to\nsee you. I want to thank you for the book you sent us. You are a wonder;\nyou surprise your very best friends even--poet, master!\"\n",
                "Ole talked on, pleased and happy over his friend's accomplishment,\nadmiring now one stanza, now another, and thanking Irgens over and over.\n",
                "\"Aagot and I have read it with beating hearts!\" he said. \"I really believe\nAagot wept a little now and then--Yes; you did; no use denying it, Aagot.\nYou need not feel ashamed of that--What I wanted to say--come along to\nthe telegraph office, Irgens; then we'll drop in at Sara's afterward, if\nyou like. I have a little surprise for you.\"\n",
                "Aagot said nothing.\n",
                "\"You can walk up and down a little while I telegraph,\" said Ole. \"But\ndon't get impatient if it takes some time. I have got to catch a ship\nbefore it leaves Arendal!\"\n",
                "And Ole ran up the stairs and disappeared; Irgens looked after him.\n",
                "\"Listen--I want to thank you for your book!\" said Aagot quickly in a low\nvoice. \"You will never know how I have enjoyed it.\"\n",
                "\"Really? Truly? It is good to hear you say that,\" he replied, full of\ngratitude. That she should have waited until Ole had left in order to\nthank him was a charming and delicate tribute; she had done it now much\nmore genuinely and warmly; her words meant so much more now. She told him\nwhat had especially stirred her; it was that wonderful \"Song to Life\";\nnever had she read anything so beautiful. Then, as if she feared she had\nspoken too warmly and laid herself open to misunderstanding, she added in\nan ordinary tone of voice that Ole had been just as enchanted as she; he\nhad read most of it aloud to her.\n",
                "Irgens made a wry face. Did she care to have things read to her? Really?\n",
                "It was intentionally that Aagot had mixed Ole's name into the\nconversation. This afternoon he had once more asked her about the wedding,\nand she had left everything to him; there was no reason for delay. It had\nbeen decided to have the wedding after Ole had returned from London this\ncoming fall. Ole was as good as the day was long; he never grew impatient\nwith her and was almost absurdly fond of her. He had said that perhaps she\nhad better spend a little time in the house occasionally. She had flushed;\nshe could not help it; it was disgraceful not to have stirred a finger to\nmake herself a little useful instead of hanging around the office early\nand late. Suppose she began to think a little about their house, said Ole;\nshe might make up her mind about things they wanted, furniture and such.\nOf course, she should have all the help she needed, but--Yes, it was only\ntoo true; she had not given her new home a thought; she had simply hung\nabout the office with him. She had begun to cry, and had told him how\nsilly and useless she really was; she was a goose, a stupid little goose.\nBut Ole had taken her in his arms and had sat down with her on the sofa\nand told her that she was only a child, a charming, wonderful child, but\nshe was getting older and more sensible right along; time and life were\nbefore them. How he loved her! His eyes, too, were wet; he looked like a\nchild himself. Above all, there was no hurry; she had free hands to decide\nand arrange, just as she pleased. Yes; they were fully agreed....\n",
                "\"I must confess I feared you had lost interest in us poets,\" said Irgens.\n\"I was afraid we had forfeited your good-will in some way.\"\n",
                "She woke up and looked at him.\n",
                "\"Why do you say that?\"\n",
                "\"I had come to that conclusion. You remember that evening at Tivoli when\nyour old tutor was quite severe on us poor scribblers? You looked as if\nyou heartily approved of everything he said.\"\n",
                "\"No, you are mistaken.\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"I am very glad that I have met you, anyway,\" said Irgens as indifferently\nas he could. \"Only to see you is enough to put me in good spirits. It must\nbe wonderful to be able to bring happiness to others simply by appearing.\"\n",
                "She had not the heart to show displeasure over that; perhaps he really\nmeant it, strange though it sounded, and she answered smilingly:\n",
                "\"It would be hard on you if you depended on me to bring you good spirits.\"\nGod knows she had not meant to pain him; she had said it in all innocence,\nwithout any veiled thought or ulterior motive; but when Irgens's head\ndrooped and he said quietly, \"Yes, I understand!\" it occurred to her that\nseveral interpretations might be placed upon this sentence, and she added\nhurriedly: \"For you do not see me very often. By the way, I am going to\nthe country this summer; I shall probably be away until fall.\"\n",
                "He stopped.\n",
                "\"Are you going to the country?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. I am going with Mrs. Tidemand. I shall be with her until fall.\"\n",
                "Irgens was silent and thoughtful a few moments.\n",
                "\"Has it been decided that Tidemands are going to the country, then?\" he\nasked. \"I understood it was not settled yet.\"\n",
                "Aagot nodded and said that it had been decided.\n",
                "\"That pleasure has been denied me,\" he said with a wistful smile. \"No\ncountry joys for me.\"\n",
                "\"Why not?\"\n",
                "She regretted her question immediately; of course, he could not afford it.\nShe was always so indelicate and awkward! She added a few meaningless\nwords to save him the humiliation of a reply.\n",
                "\"When I want to go to the country I hire a boat and row over to the\nisland,\" he said with his sad smile. \"Anyway, it is better than nothing.\"\n",
                "The island? She grew 'attentive. \"Of course, the island! I haven't been\nthere yet. Is it pretty?\"\n",
                "\"Beautiful! There are some wonderful places. I know them all. If I only\ndared I would ask you to let me row you over some time?\"\n",
                "This was not said in simple courtesy; it was a request. She understood it\nperfectly. But she said, all the same, that she was not sure she had time;\nit would be interesting, but--\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"I wrote many of my poems there,\" continued Irgens. \"I should like to show\nyou the place.\"\n",
                "Aagot was silent.\n",
                "\"Come, please!\" he exclaimed suddenly, and wanted to take her hand.\n",
                "Just then Ole Henriksen appeared on the stairs and came toward them.\nIrgens remained in his pleading attitude; he said with outstretched hand:\n",
                "\"Do, please!\"\n",
                "She glanced at him hurriedly.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she whispered.\n",
                "Ole joined them; he had not been able to get hold of Arendal at once; he\ncould not get a reply until to-morrow. Off to Sara now! He really had a\nsurprise for them--he carried in his pocket Ojen's latest work. They just\nought to hear it!\n"

                "    \"You are calling me?\" said Jehovah.\n",

                "    And she was tall and white, and her eyes were like two blue flowers\n    which brushed my soul when she looked at me; and when she spoke to me\n    she entreated me and urged me toward her, and her voice was like a\n    sweet phosphorescence with a taste of the sea.\n",
                "    I rose from the earth and stretched forth my arms toward her, and when\n    I stretched both my arms toward her she again implored me, and her\n    body was odorous with rapture. And I was gloriously stirred in my\n    inmost being, and I rose and gave her my lips in the morning glow,\n    and my eyes fell.\n",
                "    When I looked up again the woman was old. And the woman was old and\n    hoary with years, and her body had shrunk with age, and she had very\n    little life left. But when I looked up the sky was darkling toward\n    night, yes dark like night, and the woman was without hair. I looked\n    to her and knew her not and knew not the sky, and when I looked toward\n    the woman she was gone.\n",
                "    \"This was Beauty!\" said Jehovah. \"Beauty wanes. I am Jehovah!\"\n",
                "    And Jehovah touched my eyes again, and I beheld:\n",
                "    I saw a terrace, high, beneath a castle. There were two people there,\n    and the two people on the terrace were young and full of joy. And the\n    sun shone on the castle, and on the terrace, and the sun shone on the\n    two people and on the gravel deep, deep down the abyss, on the hard\n    driveway. And the people were two, a man and a woman in the springtide\n    of youth, and both were speaking honeyed words, and both were tender\n    toward each other with desire.\n",
                "    \"See the flower on my breast!\" he said; \"can you hear what it is\n    saying?\" And he leaned backward toward the railing on the terrace\n    and said: \"This flower which you gave me stands here and murmurs\n    and whispers toward you, and it murmurs: 'Beloved, Queen, Alvilde,\n    Alvilde!' Do you hear it?\"\n",
                "    And she smiled and looked down, and she took his hand and placed his\n    hand against her heart and answered: \"But do you hear what my heart\n    says to you? My heart throbs toward you and it blushes with emotion\n    for your sake. And my heart babbles in joyful confusion and says:\n    'Beloved, I pause before you and almost perish when you look at me,\n    Beloved!'\"\n",
                "    He leaned toward the terrace-railing and gloriously his breast heaved\n    with love. And deep, deep below was the abyss and the hard driveway.\n    And he pointed his finger down the depths and said: \"Throw down your\n    fan, and I will follow it!\" And when he had spoken his breast rose and\n    sank, and he placed his hands on the railing and made ready for the\n    leap.\n",
                "    Then I cried out and closed my eyes....\n",
                "    But when I looked up I saw again the two people, and they were both\n    older and both in their prime. And the two did not speak to each\n    other, but were silent with their thoughts. And when I looked up the\n    sky was grey, and the two walked up the white castle-stairway, and she\n    was full of indifference, yes full of hate in her steely eyes, and\n    when I looked for the third time I saw also anger and hate in his\n    glance, and his hair was grey like the grey skies.\n",
                "    And as they ascended the stairs she dropped her fan, one step down it\n    dropped, and she said with quivering lips and pointed downward: \"I\n    dropped my fan--there it lies on the lower step--please hand it to me,\n    dear!\"\n",
                "    And he did not answer, but walked on and called a servant to pick up\n    the fan.\n",
                "    \"This was Love,\" said Jehovah. \"Love perishes. I am Jehovah!\"\n",
                "    And Jehovah touched my eyes for the last time, and I beheld:\n",
                "    I saw a town and a public square, and I saw a scaffold. And when I\n    listened I heard a seething sound of voices, and when I looked I saw\n    many people who talked and gritted their teeth with joy. And I saw a\n    man who was being bound, a malefactor who was being bound with leather\n    thongs, and the malefactor's countenance was haughty and proud, and\n    his eyes shone like stars. But his garment was torn and his feet stood\n    naked on the ground, and his clothes were almost gone, yes his cloak\n    was worn to almost nothing.\n",
                "    And I listened and heard a voice, and when I looked I saw that the\n    malefactor was speaking, and the malefactor spoke proudly and\n    gloriously. And they bade him be silent, but he spoke, he testified,\n    he shouted, and when they bade him be silent he did not cease with\n    fear. And when the malefactor spoke the mob ran up and silenced his\n    lips, and when he mutely pointed to the sky and to the sun, and when\n    he pointed to his heart which still beat warmly, the mob ran up and\n    struck him. And when the mob struck him the malefactor fell to his\n    knees, and he knelt and clasped his hands and testified mutely,\n    without words, in spite of the cruel blows.\n",
                "    And I looked at the malefactor and saw his eyes like stars, and I saw\n    the mob throw him down and hold him on the scaffold with their hands.\n    And when once more I looked I saw an axe-blade write in the air, and\n    when I listened I heard the stroke of the axe against the scaffolding\n    and the people joyfully shouting. And while I listened a\n    single-throated cry rose toward heaven from people groaning with\n    ecstasy.\n",
                "    But the malefactor's head rolled in the dirt and the mob ran up and\n    seized it and lifted it high by the hair. And the malefactor's head\n    still spoke, and it testified with unquenchable voice and spoke loudly\n    all the words it uttered. And the malefactor's head was not silent\n    even in death.\n",
                "    But the mob ran up and took hold of the malefactor's head by the\n    tongue and lifted it high by the tongue. And the vanquished tongue was\n    mute, and the tongue spoke no more. But the eyes were like stars, yes,\n    like gleaming stars to be seen by everybody....\n",
                "    Then Jehovah said: \"This was Truth. And Truth speaks even after its\n    head is severed. And with its tongue bound its eyes shine like stars.\n    I am Jehovah!\"\n",
                "    When Jehovah had spoken I fell on my face and spoke not, but was\n    silent with much thought. And I thought that Beauty was lovely ere\n    it waned and Love was sweet ere it perished, and I thought that Truth\n    endured like stars everlasting. And tremblingly I thought of Truth.\n",
                "    And Jehovah said: \"You wanted to know what to choose in life?\" And\n    Jehovah said then: \"Have you chosen?\"\n",
                "    I lay on my face and answered, full of many thoughts:\n",
                "    \"Beauty was lovely and Love was very sweet; and if I choose Truth,\n    it is like the stars, eternal.\"\n",
                "    And Jehovah spake once more and asked me:\n",
                "    \"Have you chosen?\"\n",
                "    And my thoughts were many, my thoughts warred mightily within me, and\n    I answered:\n",
                "    \"Beauty was like a morning glow.\" And when I had said this I whispered\n    and said: \"Love was also sweet and glorious like a little star in my\n    soul.\"\n",
                "    But then I felt Jehovah's eye on me, and Jehovah's eye read my\n    thoughts. And for the third time Jehovah asked and said:\n",
                "    \"Have you chosen?\"\n",
                "    And when He said for the third time: \"Have you chosen?\" my eyes stared\n    with terror, yes, all my strength had left me. And when He said for\n    the last time: \"Have you chosen?\" I remembered Beauty and Love and\n    remembered them both, and I answered Jehovah:\n",
                "    \"I choose Truth!\"\n",

                "Everybody was silent for a moment; then the Journalist said:\n",
                "\"I refrain from expressing an opinion; I notice Milde is going to say\nsomething.\"\n",
                "And Milde did not refrain; far from it; on the contrary, he had a remark\nto make. Could anybody tell him what it was all about? He admired Ojen as\nmuch as anybody, but was there any sense to all this \"Jehovah said\" and\n\"Jehovah said\"? He wanted to be enlightened.\n",
                "\"But why are you always so unkind to Ojen?\" asked Mrs. Hanka. \"Memories--\ncan't you understand? To me it seemed beautiful and full of feeling; don't\nspoil it for me now.\" And she turned to Aagot and said: \"Didn't you find\nit so, too?\"\n",
                "\"But, dear Mrs. Hanka,\" exclaimed Milde, \"don't say that I am always\nunkind to Ojen! Do I not wish him success with his application for the\nsubsidy, contrary to my own interests? But this blessed new 'intention' is\nbeyond me. Memories--all right. But where, in Heaven's name, is the point?\nJehovah has never visited him; it is an invention. And, furthermore, why\ndidn't he choose both Youth and Beauty, and Truth as well? That is what I\nshould have done. The point, I say!\"\n",
                "\"But that is just it--there is no definite point,\" replied Ole Henriksen.\n\"So Ojen says in a letter to me. Its effect lies in its euphony, he says.\"\n",
                "\"He does? No, that fellow is the same wherever he goes. That is the\ntrouble. Not even the mountains can do anything for him. Goats' milk and\npine woods and peasant girls have not the slightest effect on him, as it\nwere--I am still at a loss to understand why he sent _you_ his\nmanuscript, Ole; but if it is an offence to ask, of course, then--\"\n",
                "\"I really don't know why he sent it to me,\" said Ole quietly. \"He tells me\nthat he wanted me to see that he was doing something and not wasting his\ntime altogether. He is anxious to get back, though; he cannot stand\nTorahus any longer.\"\n",
                "Milde whistled.\n",
                "\"I understand! He asked you for carfare!\"\n",
                "\"I do not suppose he has much money left. That could hardly be expected,\"\nanswered Ole, and put the manuscript in his pocket. \"As for me, I think it\nis a remarkable poem, irrespective of your opinion.\"\n",
                "\"Surely, old fellow; but please don't talk about poetry,\" interrupted\nMilde. And as it dawned on him that he had been a little too rude to the\npoor peddler in Aagot's presence, he added hurriedly: \"I mean--Isn't it\ntoo much of a bore to talk about poetry and poetry all the time? Give us,\nfor a change, a little fishery talk, a little railway politics--Isn't it a\nfierce lot of rye you are storing, Tidemand?\"\n",
                "As Tidemand saw many eyes upon him, he could not entirely ignore the\nArtist's question, and he answered:\n",
                "\"Yes, I have tried to strike a modest blow; I cannot deny it. It all\ndepends now on how things turn out in Russia. If, in spite of everything\nthat had been forecasted, the crops should prove even middling, it does\nnot look any too bright for me and my rye. Rains in Russia now would\nmean--\"\n",
                "\"Rains are falling now,\" said Gregersen. \"The English papers have been\ninformed of a sufficient rainfall in the larger provinces. Are you selling\nyour rye already?\"\n",
                "Of course, Tidemand had bought to sell if he could get his price.\n",
                "Milde had moved over to Paulsberg, and spoke to him in a low whisper.\nOjen's prose poem had caused him some anxiety. Perhaps, after all, there\nwas something to this fellow, this competitor in the matter of the\nsubsidy. What was Paulsberg's opinion?\n",
                "\"You know I don't care to speak for or against in such a matter,\" said\nPaulsberg. \"But I have called at the ministry a few times and expressed my\npreference. I hope it may carry some weight.\"\n",
                "\"Of course, of course, I didn't mean--Well, the Exhibition closes\nto-morrow. We ought to get busy and finish that picture of yours. Can you\nsit tomorrow?\"\n",
                "Paulsberg nodded and turned away.\n",
                "Irgens had gradually lost his good spirits; it irritated him that no one\nhad mentioned his book. It was the latest event; why wasn't it even\nreferred to? Everybody was only too familiar with Ojen's filigree fancies.\nIrgens shrugged his shoulders. Paulsberg had not indicated approval of his\nbook by a single word. Perhaps he was waiting to be asked? But Irgens\ncould get along without Paulsberg's opinion.\n",
                "Irgens rose.\n",
                "\"Are you going?\" asked Mrs. Hanka.\n",
                "Irgens said good night to her and to Miss Aagot, nodded to the others, and\nleft Sara's.\n",
                "He had only gone a few steps when he heard somebody call him. Mrs. Hanka\nwas hurrying after him; she had left her wraps in the cafe and had\nfollowed in order to say good night properly. Wasn't that nice of her? She\nsmiled and was very happy.\n",
                "\"I have hardly seen you since I got your book. How I have enjoyed every\nword!\" she exclaimed, and put her hand in his coat pocket in order to be\nclose to him. He felt that she left an envelope in his pocket. \"Oh, your\nverses, your verses!\" she said again and again.\n",
                "He could not remain impassive in the presence of this warm admiration. He\nwanted to return it, to show her how fond he was of her, and while in this\nmood he confided to her that he, too, had applied for the subsidy. What\ndid she think of that? He had really applied, briefly and without\nenclosing any recommendations, simply sending his book. That ought to be\nsufficient.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka did not answer at once.\n",
                "\"You have suffered, then,\" she said; \"you have lacked--I mean, you have\nhad to apply like the others--\"\n",
                "\"Well, good Lord,\" he answered, and laughed, \"what are the subsidies for,\nanyway? I have not suffered want; but why not apply when one can do it\nwithout loss of prestige? And I did not humble myself; be sure of that. 'I\nhereby apply for the subsidy and enclose my last book'--that was all.\nThere was no kowtowing whatever. And when I survey my fellow applicants I\nhardly think I shall be entirely eclipsed. What is your opinion?\"\n",
                "She smiled and said:\n",
                "\"No, you will not be eclipsed.\"\n",
                "He put his arm around her and said:\n",
                "\"Now, Hanka, you must go back--I can endure it all as long as you are in\ntown, but when you go away it will look very dark for me! I shan't know\nwhat to do with myself then.\"\n",
                "\"I am only going to the country,\" she said.\n",
                "\"Isn't that enough? We shall be separated just the same, for you know I\ncannot leave the city. When are you going?\"\n",
                "\"I imagine in about a week.\"\n",
                "\"I wish you wouldn't go away, Hanka!\" he exclaimed, and stood still.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka reflected.\n",
                "\"Would it really please you so much if I stayed?\" she asked. \"All right;\nthen I'll stay. Yes, I will. It will be hard on the children, but--Anyway,\nit is enough for me that I make you glad.\"\n",
                "They had reached Sara's once more.\n",
                "\"Good night,\" he said happily. \"Thank you, Hanka! When shall I see you\nagain? I am longing--\"\n"

                "Three days later Irgens received a note from Mrs. Hanka.\n",
                "He was down-town; he had met a few acquaintances; he did not say much, but\nwas in a satisfied frame of mind. He had taken a look at Paulsberg's great\nportrait which was now exhibited in the Arrow, in the large window which\neverybody had to pass; people crowded in front of it continually. The\npainting was elegant and obtrusive; Paulsberg's well-groomed form looked\nvery distinguished in the plain cane-bottomed chair, and people wondered\nif that was the chair in which he had written his books. All the\nnewspapers had mentioned the picture in flattering terms.\n",
                "Irgens had a glass of wine in front of him and listened abstractedly to\nthe conversation. Tidemand was still optimistic; that bit of rain in\nRussia had not depressed his hopes. The prices were not soaring as yet,\nbut they surely would. Suddenly Irgens pricked up his ears: Tidemand was\ntalking about their summer plans.\n",
                "\"We are not going to the country after all,\" he said; \"Hanka thought--In\nfact, I told her plainly that if she wanted to go she would have to go\nalone; I was too busy to think of getting off. Hanka was very nice about\nit; she agreed to stay in the city.\"\n",
                "The door opened and Milde entered. The corpulent chap beamed happily and\nshouted, full of the great sensation he was going to spring:\n",
                "\"Congratulate me, good people, I have won the prize! Imagine, in its\ninscrutable wisdom the ministry has chosen to bestow the subsidy upon me!\"\n",
                "\"Have _you_ received the subsidy?\" asked Irgens slowly.\n",
                "\"Yes, can you understand it? How it happened I am at a loss to know. I got\nit from under your very noses! I hear that you, too, applied, Irgens?\"\n",
                "Silence fell upon the crowd at the table. Nobody had expected that, and\nthey were all wondering what influence had been brought to bear. Milde had\ngot the subsidy--what next?\n",
                "\"Well, I congratulate you!\" said Tidemand, and gave Milde his hand.\n",
                "\"Thank you,\" Milde replied. \"I want you to lend me some money now, so that\nI can celebrate properly; you'll get it back when I cash in.\"\n",
                "Irgens looked at his watch as if he suddenly remembered something and got\nup.\n",
                "\"I, too, congratulate you,\" he said. \"I am sorry to have to leave at once;\nI have to--No; my object in applying was an entirely different one; I'll\ntell you about it later,\" he added in order to hide his disappointment.\n",
                "Irgens went home. So Milde had been chosen! That was the way Norway\nrewarded her talents. Here he had hurled his inspired lyric in their\nfaces, and they did not even know what it was! _Whom_ had they\npreferred? None other than oil-painter Milde, collector of ladies'\ncorsets!\n",
                "Of course, he knew how it had happened; Paulsberg was behind it. Paulsberg\nhad supported Milde's application, and Milde had painted Paulsberg's\npicture. A simon-pure advertising conspiracy! And when Irgens passed the\nArrow and saw the painting he spat contemptuously on the pavement. He had\nseen through this hypocritical scurviness. However, he would find means to\nmake himself felt.\n",
                "But why in the world should Lars Paulsberg be allowed to dispose of these\nsubsidies? True, he had never let slip an opportunity to ingratiate\nhimself with the newspapers; he had his press-agents; he took good care\nthat his name shouldn't be forgotten. But apart from that? Alas, a few\nnovels in the style of the seventies, a popular and amateurish criticism\nof such a moss-grown dogma as the Atonement! What did it amount to when\none looked at it critically? But the fact that he had the press behind him\nmade his words carry weight. Yes, he was certainly a shrewd and thrifty\nsoul, a real backwoods bargain-hunter. He knew what he was doing when he\neven allowed his wife to accept Journalist Gregersen's beer-perfumed\nattentions! Faugh, what a sordid mess!\n",
                "Well, he was not going to gain success by employing such methods; he hoped\nhe would manage to get along without unfairness. He had one weapon--his\npen. That was the kind of man _he_ was.\n",
                "He went home and locked his door. There would still be time to regain his\ncomposure before Mrs. Hanka's arrival. He tried to write, but found it\nimpossible. He paced back and forth furiously, pale with anger, bitter and\nvindictive because of this defeat. He would, by Heaven, avenge this wrong;\nno gentle words were to flow from his pen henceforth!\n",
                "At last Mrs. Hanka arrived.\n",
                "No matter how often she had entered this apartment, she always felt a\ncertain embarrassment at first, and she usually said in order to hide it:\n\"Does Mr. Irgens live here?\"\n",
                "But she noticed at once that Irgens was not in a playful mood to-day, and\nshe asked what was the matter. When he had told her of the great calamity\nshe, too, was indignant: \"How unjust! What a scandal! Had Milde been\nselected?\"\n",
                "\"In payment for Paulsberg's portrait,\" said Irgens. \"Well, it cannot be\nhelped; don't let it irritate you; I am reconciled.\"\n",
                "\"You take it beautifully; I don't see how you can.\"\n",
                "\"The only effect it has on me is to make me a little bitter; it does not\nbreak my spirit.\"\n",
                "\"I simply cannot understand it; no, I can't. Did you send your book with\nyour application?\"\n",
                "\"Certainly--Oh, my book! I might as well not have written it; so far\nnobody seems to have noticed it. There has been no review of it so far in\nany of the papers.\" And, angry because of this newspaper neglect of his\nwork, he gritted his teeth and walked up and down.\n",
                "She looked sadly at him.\n",
                "\"Now, don't allow this to embitter you,\" she said. \"You have great\nprovocation, but all the same--You can live without that miserable\nsubsidy. You know that nobody is your equal!\"\n",
                "\"And what good does that do me? Judge for yourself; my book has not been\nmentioned in a single newspaper!\"\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka had for the first time--yes, for the very first time--a feeling\nthat her hero was not the superior being she had imagined. A shuddering\nthought pierced her heart: he did not carry his disappointment with more\nthan ordinary pride. She looked at him a little closer. His eyes were not\nso clear, his mouth was drawn and his nostrils dilated. But it was only a\nshuddering thought.\n",
                "Then he added: \"You might do me the favour to try to interest Gregersen in\nmy book, and see if he won't review it in the _Gazette_.\" And as he\nnoticed that she grew more and more thoughtful, that she even looked\ninterrogatingly straight into his eyes, he added: \"Of course, you need not\nask him directly--only give him a little hint, a reminder.\"\n",
                "Could this be Irgens? But she remembered at once his painful position,\nalone as he was, fighting a conspiracy single-handed; and she excused him.\nShe ought to have thought of giving Gregersen a little hint herself and\nspared her Poet this humiliation. Yes, she certainly would speak to\nGregersen at once.\n",
                "And Irgens thanked her; his bitterness vanished slowly. They sat silently\non the sofa some time; then she said:\n",
                "\"Listen! An awful thing happened with that red tie of yours--you remember\nthe one I took from you once? He saw it!\"\n",
                "\"How could you be so careless? What did he say?\"\n",
                "\"Nothing; he never says anything. It fell out as I opened my dress. Well,\ndon't let that worry you; it doesn't matter. When can I see you again?\"\n",
                "Ever, _ever_ her tenderness was the same! Irgens took her hand and\ncaressed it. How fortunate he was to have her! She was the only one in all\nthe world who understood him, who was good to him--How about that stay in\nthe country? Had she given it up?\n",
                "Yes; she was not going. She told him frankly that she had had no trouble\nchanging her husband's mind; he had given in at once. But she was sorry\nfor the children.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" answered Irgens sympathetically. And suddenly he asked in a\nwhisper:\n",
                "\"Did you lock the door as you came in?\"\n",
                "She glanced at him, lowered her eyes and whispered: \"Yes.\"\n"

And as he walks along, the city begins to stir; a shade is\nraised here and there; flags are flung from the windows. It is the 17th of\nMay.\n",
                "All stores and schools are closed; the roar from the wharves and factories\nis stilled. Only the winches rattle; they shatter the air with their\ncheerful noise this bright morning. Departing steamers blow white clouds\nof steam from their exhausts; the docks are busy, the harbour is alive.\n",
                "And letter-carriers and telegraph messengers have already commenced their\nrounds, bringing news, scattering information through the doors, whirling\nup in the hearts of men emotions and feelings like leaves in an autumn\nwind.\n",
                "A stray dog with his nose on the pavement lopes through the streets, hot\non a scent and without a thought for anything else. Suddenly he stops,\njumps up and whines; he has found a little girl who is leaving on every\nstoop newspapers full of 17th-of-May freedom and bold, ringing phrases.\nThe little girl jerks her tiny body in all directions, twitches her\nshoulders, blinks and hurries from door to door. She is pale and\nemaciated; she has Saint Vitus's dance.\n",
                "The coal-heaver continues his walk with a heavy, long stride. He has\nearned a good night's wage; these enormous English coal-steamers and the\nmany merchantmen from all over the world are indeed a blessing to such as\nhe! His shovel is shiny with wear; he shifts it to his other shoulder and\nit glitters with every step he takes, signals to heaven with gleaming\nflashes; it cuts the air like a weapon and shines like silver. The\ncoal-heaver runs foul of a gentleman coming out of a gateway; the\ngentleman smells of liquor and looks a little shaky; his clothes are\nsilk-lined. As soon as he has lit a cigar he saunters down the street and\ndisappears.\n",
                "The gentleman's face is small and round, like a girl's; he is young and\npromising; it is Ojen, leader and model for all youthful poets.

                "\"The fact of the matter is that I have hardly been in bed a single night\nsince my return. I am in the hands of my friends.

                "\"Yes,\" said Ojen, \"one does not altogether forget the teachings of\nchildhood days.\"\n",
                "Coldevin stood there and looked after him. _He_ was only waiting for\nthe processions to start. His coat was beginning to be rather shiny; it\nwas carefully brushed, but shabby; in the left lapel was fastened securely\na little silk bow in the Norwegian colours.\n",
                "He shivered, for the air was still chilly; he walked rapidly in order to\nget down to the harbour whence sounded the energetic rattle of anchor\nchains. He nodded and glanced at the waving flags, counted them, and\nfollowed their graceful billowing against the blue sky. Here and there a\nfew pale theatre bills were posted on pillars; he went from one to another\nand read great and famous names--masterpieces from earlier periods. He\nhappened to think of Irgens's lyric drama, but he looked for it in vain.\nAnd he turned his face toward the sea; the rattle of chains reached his\nears refreshingly.\n",
                "The ships were dressed in bunting; the entire harbour scintillated with\nthese bright colours against the blue. Coldevin breathed deeply and stood\nstill. The odour of coal and tar, of wine and fruit, of fish and oils; the\nroar from engines and traffic, the shouts, the footfalls on the decks, the\nsong from a young sailor who was shining shoes in his shirtsleeves--it all\nstirred him with a violent joy which almost made his eyes moisten. What a\npower was here! What ships! The harbour gleamed; far away he saw Miss\nAagot's little yacht with the shining masthead.\n",
                "He lost himself in this spectacle. Time passed; suddenly he dived into a\nbasement restaurant that had opened up and asked for a sandwich for\nbreakfast. When he emerged a little later there were many people in the\nstreets; it was getting along toward the time for the boys' parade to\nstart. He had to hurry; it would never do to miss the processions.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Along toward three o'clock a few members of the clique had occupied a\nvantage-point at the corner, in order to see the big procession pass by\ntoward the Royal Castle. None of them marched in the parade. Suddenly one\nof them called out:\n",
                "\"Look, there is Coldevin!\"\n",
                "They saw him march now under one, now under another banner; it was as if\nhe wanted to belong to them all; he was almost too enthusiastic to keep in\nstep. Attorney Grande crossed over and joined the procession; he caught up\nwith Coldevin and started a conversation.\n",
                "\"And where is the young Norway?\" asked Coldevin, \"the poets, the artists--\nwhy aren't they marching? They ought to; it would not hurt their talent.\nIt might not help it much, either; I don't say that, but I am sure it\nwould never hurt. The trouble is, they don't care! They are indifferent;\nbut it is surely wrong to be so indifferent.\"\n",
                "Coldevin had grown still more absurd, although he spoke with his usual\ncalm deliberation. He was obstinate; he talked about the suffrage\nmovement, and even hinted that it would be better if women should be a\nlittle more anxious to make their homes attractive. It was wrong, he said,\nthat women should think too little of their home life and prefer a\nhall-room in order to become what they called \"independent.\" They had to\n\"study\" until they, too, could wear glasses; they went to a business\nschool if they could do no better. And they did their things so\nexcellently that they were graduated, and if they were lucky they would\nfinally secure a position at twenty crowns a month. Fine! But they had to\npay twenty-seven for the hall-room and meals. Then they were\n\"independent\"!\n",
                "\"But you cannot say that it is the fault of the women if their work is\npaid so poorly,\" objected the Attorney, whose wife was liberal.\n",
                "Certainly, these arguments were familiar; they were old and tried. They\nhad been answered, but.... In fact, they had been riddled several thousand\ntimes. But the worst of it was that the home was simply destroyed by the\ncorroding influence of these ideas. Coldevin accentuated this. He had\nnoticed that a great many people here in the city mainly lived in the\nrestaurants. He had looked for acquaintances in their homes, but in vain;\nhowever, he met them when he occasionally went to a caf\u00e9. He did not want\nto speak about artists and authors; they simply did not have nor did they\nwant any other home than the caf\u00e9s, and he did not understand how they\ncould accomplish anything under these circumstances. But women nowadays\nwere lacking in ambition and heart; they were satisfied with the mixed\ncompany they found in these hang-outs. They did not extend themselves in\nany one direction; they were not occupied with any single idea; they\nbecame simply roundheaded. God, how rarely one nowadays saw real race!\n",
                "Somebody in the procession called for cheers and was answered with\nscattering hurrahs. Coldevin cheered enthusiastically, although he did not\nhear what the cheers were for. He looked resentfully down the ranks and\nswung his hat, urging the marchers to shout still louder.\n",
                "\"These people don't know how to cheer!\" he said. \"They shout in a whisper;\nnobody can hear them. Help me, Mr. Attorney, and we'll liven them up!\"\n",
                "The Attorney thought it fun and shouted with him until they succeeded in\nstirring up the dying hurrahs.\n",
                "\"Once again!\" shouted Coldevin.\n",
                "And again the cheers rolled down the ranks.\n",
                "The Attorney said smilingly:\n",
                "\"That you should _care_ to do this!\"\n",
                "Coldevin looked at him. He said seriously:\n",
                "\"You should not say that. We should all care to do this; it would not hurt\nus. Of course, this parading has not in itself great significance; but\nthere will be opportunities to cheer for Norway, for the flag, and then we\nought to be present. Who knows--these booming cheers may have their effect\non Parliament; it may be reminded of a few things it has begun to forget--\na little loyalty, a little steadfastness. People should not be so\nunconcerned; now is the time for the young to step forward. Perhaps, if\nthe youth of the country had shown up occasionally and met together and\nhurrahed at times, Parliament might have settled a few things differently\nlately. And, if you had cared to take a walk along the docks to-day and\nwitnessed the nation's life throb so mightily, then, by Heaven, you would\nhave felt that the country is worth our cheers--\"\n",
                "The Attorney spied Ojen on the sidewalk; he excused himself and stepped\nout of the procession. He looked back a moment later and saw that Coldevin\nhad changed places again; he was marching under the business-men's banner,\nerect, grey-bearded, and shabby, with the glint of the Norwegian colours\non his lapel.\n"

                "Aagot was dressed for the excursion; she pulled on her gloves and was\nready.\n",
                "It had not been at all difficult to arrange this little trip; Ole had only\nrequested that she be careful and dress warmly; it was only May.\n",
                "And they started.\n",
                "It was calm, warm, and bright; not a cloud in the skies. Irgens had the\nboat ready; they had only to go aboard. He spoke intentionally about\nindifferent matters; he wanted to make her forget that she had originally\nagreed to this island trip with a whispered yes, a sudden submission right\nbefore Ole's very eyes. She was reassured. Irgens had not invested her\nsudden consent with a deeper significance than she had intended; he walked\nalong as unconcernedly as possible and talked about the weather and almost\nhad to be hurried along. Just as they were on the verge of starting she\ncaught a glimpse of Coldevin, who stood on the dock half hidden behind a\npile of boxes. She jumped out of the boat and called:\n",
                "\"Coldevin! I want to see you!\"\n",
                "It was impossible to avoid her; he stepped forward and took off his hat.\n",
                "She gave him her hand. Where in the world had he kept himself all this\ntime? Dear me, why was he never to be seen? It began to look a little\nstrange--really it did.\n",
                "He stammered an excuse, spoke about library work, a translation from a\nbook, an absolutely necessary bit of work....\n",
                "But she interrupted and asked where he lived now. She had looked for him\nat the hotel but was told that he had left; nobody knew where he had gone.\nShe had also had a glimpse of him on the seventeenth; she was in the Grand\nand saw him march by in the parade.\n",
                "He repeated his excuses and trotted out the old joke about the impropriety\nof disturbing sweethearts too much. He smiled good-naturedly as he spoke.\n",
                "She observed him carefully. His clothes were threadbare, his face had\nbecome thinner, and she wondered suddenly if he were in want. Why had he\nleft the hotel, and where did he live? He said something about a friend, a\ncollege chum--honest, a teacher, a splendid fellow.\n",
                "Aagot asked when he was going back to Torahus, but he did not know\nexactly; he was unable to say. As long as he had this library work and was\nso busy....\n",
                "Well, he simply must promise to come before he went away; she insisted.\nAnd she asked suddenly: \"When I saw you on the seventeenth, didn't you\nhave a bow in your buttonhole?\"\n",
                "Certainly, he had a bow; one had to show the colours on such a day! Didn't\nshe remember that she had given it to him herself? She had wanted him to\nbe decorated last year, when he was going to speak to the peasants at\nTorahus, and she had given him the bow. Didn't she remember?\n",
                "Aagot recalled it. She asked:\n",
                "\"Was it really the same bow?\"\n",
                "\"Yes; isn't it strange? I happened to come across it; I must have brought\nit along with some clothes; I found it by accident.\"\n",
                "\"Imagine! I thought at once it was my bow. It made me glad; I don't know\nwhy,\" she said and bowed her head.\n",
                "Irgens shouted and asked her if she were coming.\n",
                "\"No!\" she called bluntly and without thinking. She did not even turn her\nhead. But when she realised how she had answered she grew confused and\ncried to Irgens: \"Pardon me just a moment!\" And she turned to Coldevin\nagain: \"I would have loved to stay and talk with you, but I have no time;\nI am going to the island.\" She offered Coldevin her hand and said:\n\"Anyway, I hope everything will turn out for the best; don't you think it\nwill, too? I am sorry to have to hurry off. So long; be sure and come up\nsoon!\"\n",
                "She skipped down the steps and into the boat. Again she apologised for\nkeeping Irgens waiting.\n",
                "And Irgens rowed out. They talked about the sea, the far journeys, the\nstrange countries; he had been abroad only in his dreams, and he supposed\nthat would be the extent of his travellings. He looked sad and listless.\nSuddenly he said:\n",
                "\"I hear you are not going to the country after all.\"\n",
                "\"No. The Tidemands have changed their plans.\"\n",
                "\"So I am told. It is a pity; I am sorry for your sake, in a way.\" And,\nresting on his oars, he added bluntly: \"But I am glad for my own sake; I\nadmit it frankly.\"\n",
                "Aagot skipped up the stone jetty when they landed. The trees delighted\nher; it was ages since she had seen a real forest--such great big trees,\njust like home. She sniffed the pungent, pine-laden air, she looked at\nstones and flowers with a feeling of recognition; memories from home\nsurged through her, and she was for an instant on the verge of tears.\n",
                "\"But here are other people!\" she exclaimed suddenly.\n",
                "Irgens laughed: \"What did you expect? This is not a jungle, exactly.\"\n",
                "They explored the island thoroughly, saw the changing views, and had\nrefreshments. Aagot beamed. The walk in the bracing air had flushed her\ncheeks, her lips, her ears, even her nose; her eyes were sparkling gaily.\nShe suddenly remembered that she had almost pouted in disappointment when\nshe saw other people; what must Irgens have thought?\n",
                "\"I was at first a little surprised to find so many people here,\" she said.\n\"The reason was that you told me you had written some of your poems here,\nand I did not think you could have done that unless you had been entirely\nundisturbed.\"\n",
                "How she remembered! He gazed at her exultantly and answered that he had\nhis own restful nook where nobody ever came. It was on the other side;\nshould they go over?\n",
                "They went. It was certainly a restful place, a regular wilderness of rocks\nand heather and junipers, enclosed on two sides. Far in the distance could\nbe seen a little glade. They sat down.\n",
                "\"So this is where you sit and write!\" she exclaimed. \"It is strange to\nthink of. Were you sitting here?\"\n",
                "\"About here. Do you know, it is refreshing to meet such a spontaneous\ninterest as yours?\"\n",
                "\"Tell me, how do you write your things? Do the thoughts come to you\nwithout conscious effort?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, in a way. Things affect one pleasantly or otherwise, and the mood is\nthere. But the trouble then is to make the words reflect the love or hate\none's heart feels at the moment. Often it is useless even to try; one can\nnever find words adequately to express that languid gesture of your hand,\nto define that evanescent thrill your laughter sends through one--\"\n",
                "Slowly the sun sank; a tremor quivered through the trees, and all was\nstill.\n",
                "\"Listen,\" he said, \"do you hear the noise boiling away yonder in the\ncity?\"\n",
                "He noted how her dress tightened across her knee; he followed the curving\noutline of her figure, saw how her bosom rose and sank, observed her face\nwith the darling dimple and the somewhat irregular nose; his blood stirred\nand he moved closer to her. He spoke in fumbling, broken sentences:\n",
                "\"This is now the Isle of the Blest, and its name is Evenrest. The sun is\nsinking; we are here--the world far off; it is exactly my dream of dreams.\nTell me, does my voice disturb you? You seem so far away--Miss Lynum, it\nis useless to continue the struggle; I surrender to you. I lie at your\nfeet and tell you this, although I have not moved--\"\n",
                "The swift change in his expression, the low, vibrant, fervent voice, his\nnearness--for a moment she was completely, stupidly stunned. She looked at\nhim for an instant without answering. Then her cheeks began to flame; she\nstarted to get up and said quickly:\n",
                "\"But isn't it time to go?\"\n",
                "\"No!\" he exclaimed. \"No, don't go!\" He took hold of her dress, flung his\narm around her, and held her back. She struggled with face aglow, laughing\nuncertainly, making vain efforts to free herself.\n",
                "\"You must be crazy,\" she said again and again; \"have you completely\nforgotten yourself?\"\n",
                "\"Please, let me at least tell you something!\"\n",
                "\"Well, what is it?\" she asked and sat still; she turned her face away, but\nshe listened.\n",
                "And he began speaking rapidly and incoherently; his heart-beats trembled\nin his voice, which was persuasive and full of tenderness. She could see\nthat all he wanted was to make her understand how unspeakably he loved\nher; how he had been conquered, subdued as never before. She must believe\nhim; it had lain dormant and grown in his heart since the very first time\nhe met her. He had fought and struggled to keep his feelings within\nbounds; but it was true--such a struggle was not very effective. It was\ntoo sweet to yield, and so one yielded. One fought on with a steadily\nslipping grip. And now the end had come; he could not fight any more, he\nwas entirely disarmed.... \"I believe my breast will burst asunder.\"...\n",
                "Still leaning away from him, she had turned her face and was gazing at him\nwhile he spoke. Her hands had ceased their ineffectual efforts and were\nnow resting on his, tightly clasped around her waist; she saw the blood\nleap through the veins along his throat. She straightened up and sat\nerect; his hands were still around her, but she did not seem to notice it\nnow. She seized her gloves and said with quivering lips:\n",
                "\"But, Irgens, you should not say such things to me. You know you\nshouldn't. It is sad, but I cannot help it now.\"\n",
                "\"No, you are right; I don't suppose I ought to have said it, but--\" He\ngazed at her; his lips were trembling too. \"But, Miss Aagot, what would\n_you_ do if your love made you weak and powerless; if it robbed you\nof your senses and blinded you to everything else? I mean--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, but say nothing more!\" she interrupted. \"I understand you in a way,\nbut--You know, I cannot listen to this.\" She looked at the arms around\nher waist, and with a sudden jerk she moved away and got up.\n",
                "She was still so confused that she remained standing immobile; she did not\neven brush the heather from her dress. And when he got up she made no\neffort to go, but remained where she was.\n",
                "\"Listen, I want you to promise not to tell this to anybody. I am afraid--\nAnd you must not think of me any more. I had no idea that you really\ncared; of course, I thought that you liked me very much--I had begun to\nthink that; but I never thought--'How could _he_ care for\n_me?_' I always thought. If you want me to I will go back to Torahus\nand stay there awhile.\"\n",
                "He was deeply moved; he swallowed hard and his eyes grew moist. This\ndelicious simplicity, these candid words, her very attitude, which was\nfree from fear and entirely unaffected--his feelings flared up in him like\na consuming flame: No, no, not to Torahus--only stay! He would control\nhimself, would show her that he could control himself; she must not go\naway. Even should he lose his mind and perish altogether--rather that, if\nshe would only stay!\n",
                "He continued talking while he was brushing off her dress. She must pardon\nhim; he was not like everybody else, he was a poet; when it came over him\nhe must yield. But he would give her no further cause for complaint if she\nwould only stay.... Wouldn't she mind going away the least little bit,\nthough? No, of course, he had no false illusions.\n",
                "Pause. He was waiting for her to answer, to contradict him; perhaps she\nwould go to Torahus a little regretfully after all? But she remained\nsilent. Did she, then, hold him in so slight regard? Impossible! Still,\nthe thought began to worry him; he felt aggrieved, hurt, almost slighted.\nHe repeated his question: Did all his love for her not call forth the\ntiniest responsive spark in her heart?\n",
                "She answered gently and sorrowfully:\n",
                "\"Please do not ask. What do you think Ole would say if he heard you?\"\n",
                "Ole? He had not given him a thought. Did he really play the role of\ncompetitor to Ole Henriksen? It was too ridiculous. He could not believe\nthat she meant what she had said. Ole might be all right as far as that\nwent; he bought and sold, went his peddler rounds through life, paid his\nbills and added dollars to his hoard. That was all. Did money really\nmatter so much to her? God knows, perhaps even this girlish little head\nhad its concealed nook where thoughts were figuring in crowns and pennies!\n",
                "Irgens was silent for an instant; he felt the pangs of jealousy. Ole might\nbe able to hold her; he was tall and blue-eyed--perhaps she even preferred\nhim?\n",
                "\"Ole?\" he said. \"I do not care in the least what he would say. Ole does\nnot exist for me; it is you I love.\"\n",
                "She seemed startled for the first time; she frowned a little and began to\nwalk away.\n",
                "\"This is too contemptible!\" she said. \"I wish you hadn't said that. So it\nis me you love? Well, don't tell me any more about it.\"\n",
                "\"Miss Aagot--one word only. Don't you care the least little bit for me?\"\n",
                "He had seized her arm; she had to look at him. He was too violent; he did\nnot control himself as he had promised; he was not very handsome now.\n",
                "She answered: \"I love Ole; I hope you understand that.\"\n",
                "The sun sank deeper. People had left the island; only an occasional late\nstraggler was still seen walking along the road toward the city. Irgens\ndid not ask questions any more; he spoke only when necessary. Aagot tried\nin vain to start a conversation; she had all she could do to keep her\nheart under control.\n",
                "When they were in the boat again he said: \"Perhaps you would have\npreferred to drive back alone? I may be able to find a hackman for you, if\nyou like.\"\n",
                "\"Now don't be angry any more!\" she said.\n",
                "She could hardly keep her eyes from brimming over; she forced herself to\nthink of indifferent matters in order to regain control over herself; she\ngazed back toward the island, followed the flight of a bird that sailed\ngracefully above the water. She asked:\n",
                "\"Is that water over there?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" he answered; \"it is a meadow; the dew makes it look dark.\"\n",
                "\"Imagine! To me it looked like water.\" But as it was impossible to talk\nfurther about this green meadow they were both silent.\n",
                "He was rowing hard; they approached the docks. He landed and jumped out to\nhelp her ashore. Neither of them had gloves on; her warm hand rested in\nhis, and she took the opportunity of thanking him for the trip.\n",
                "\"I want to ask you to forget that I have bothered you with my heart\ntroubles,\" he said.\n",
                "And he lifted his hat, without waiting for an answer, jumped into the\nboat, and pushed off.\n",
                "She had stopped at the head of the steps. She saw that he went back into\nthe boat, and wanted to call to him and ask where he was going; but she\ngave it up. He saw her fair form disappear across the jetty.\n",
                "He had in reality not intended to do this; he acted on the spur of the\nmoment, embarrassed as he was, hardly knowing what he was doing. He seized\nthe oars and rowed out again, towards the island. The evening was\nwondrously calm. Now, when he was alone, he realised how deep was his\ndespair; another disappointment, another fall, the very worst! And not a\nstar in the murky night! He suddenly remembered Hanka, who probably had\nlooked for him to-day; who perhaps was seeking him even now. No; Hanka was\nnot fair; Hanka was dark; she did not radiate, but she allured. But how\nwas it--didn't she walk a little peculiarly? No, Hanka did not have\nAagot's carriage. And why was it her laugh no longer made his blood\ntingle?\n",
                "He rested on the oars and let the boat drift. It grew darker. Fragmentary\nthoughts drifted through his brain: a rudderless ship on the buffeting\nwaves, an emperor in defeat, King Lear, thoughts and thoughts. He went aft\nand began to write on the back of some envelopes, verse upon verse. Thank\nGod, nothing could rob him of his talent! And this thought sent a thrill\nof warm happiness coursing through his veins.\n"

                "Tidemand was still optimistic; his ice business in England was very\nprofitable. He did not place much faith in the reports that extensive\nrains throughout Russia had greatly improved the prospects for a normal\nharvest. It had rained, of course, but the fact remained that Russia was\nstill closed; not a sack of grain could be smuggled out if one were to\noffer for it its weight in gold. Tidemand stuck to his price; occasionally\nhe would sell small quantities throughout the country, but his enormous\nstores were hardly affected by this; he needed a panic, a famine, before\nhe could unload. But there was no hurry; only wait until winter!\n",
                "As usual, Tidemand was eagerly sought by business solicitors of every\ndescription; subscription lists and all kinds of propositions were placed\nbefore him; his name was in demand everywhere. Nothing could be started\nwithout the support of the business element; and it was especially the\nyounger business men, the energetic and self-made men who conducted the\nlarge enterprises, who commanded money and credit and knew and recognised\nopportunities, whose interest had to be enlisted. There was the electric\nstreet-car proposition, the new theatre, the proposed pulp-mills in\nVardal, the whale-oil factories in Henningsvaer--everything had to have\nthe business men's stamp of approval. Both Tidemand and Ole Henriksen\nbecame share-owners in everything as a matter of course.\n",
                "\"My father should have known this!\" Tidemand would often say when he gave\nhis signature. His father had a reputation for miserly thrift which had\nsurvived him; he was one of the old-fashioned tradesmen, who went around\nin his shirt-sleeves and apron, and weighed out soap and flour by the\npound. He had no time to dress decently; his shoes were still a byword;\nthe toes were sticking out, and when he walked it looked as if his toes\nwere searching for pennies on the flagstones. The son did not resemble the\nfather much; for him the old horizons had been broken, cracked wide, and\nopened large views; his optimistic business courage was recognised.\n",
                "Ole Henriksen had just dropped in on him in his office and was talking\nabout the projected tannery for which an ideal site had been found near\nTorahus. This enterprise was bound to amount to something in the near\nfuture; the great forests were being cut rapidly; the lumber was sold here\nand abroad. But two and three inch cuttings and the tops were left and\nwent to waste. What a lack of foresight! Pine bark contained nearly twenty\nper cent tannin; why not utilise it and make money out of it?\n",
                "\"We will see what can be done next spring.\"\n",
                "Ole Henriksen looked a little overworked. He had not sufficient help; when\nhe went to England that autumn he would have to give his head assistant\npower of attorney and leave everything to him. Since Aagot came Ole's work\nhad been only fun; but now she was a little indisposed and had kept\nup-stairs for a couple of days. Ole missed her. She must have been\ncareless on this excursion day before yesterday and have caught a cold. He\nhad wanted to take her out in the little yacht, but this had now been\npostponed until Sunday. He asked Tidemand to come along; there would be a\nfew more; they would sail out to some reef and have coffee.\n",
                "\"Are you sure Miss Aagot will be well by Sunday?\" asked Tidemand. \"These\nboat-rides are dangerous so early in the year. What I was going to say\nwas: Won't you please ask Hanka yourself? I am not sure I can make her\ncome--In regard to this tannery proposition, I think I shall have to hold\nthe matter in abeyance for the present. It will also depend on the lumber\nquotations to some extent.\"\n",
                "Ole returned after he had looked up Hanka and invited her. He wondered a\nlittle over Tidemand's remark about boat-rides being dangerous; Tidemand\nhad given the remark a subtle meaning, and Ole had looked at him\ninterrogatingly.\n",
                "Ole found Aagot in her own room; she was reading. When he entered she\nthrew down her book and ran to him. She was well again, entirely well--\njust feel the pulse, not a trace of fever! How she looked forward to\nSunday! Ole warned her again about being careful; she would have to dress\nproperly. Even Tidemand had spoken about these risky boat-rides so early\nin the season.\n",
                "\"And you are going to be the hostess!\" he chaffed her. \"What a darling\nlittle mistress! By the way, what are you reading?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, that is only Irgens's poems,\" she answered.\n",
                "\"Don't say 'only' Irgens's poems,\" he chided her playfully. \"By the way, I\nran across Coldevin a moment ago; he said he was looking for somebody. I\ncouldn't get him to come up--he simply wouldn't.\"\n",
                "\"Did you invite him to our excursion?\" asked Aagot quickly. She seemed\nvery much disappointed because Ole had forgotten to ask him. He had to\npromise her to try his best to find Coldevin before Sunday.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Tidemand rang Henriksen's bell late Saturday evening and asked for Ole. He\ndid not want to come in; it was only a small matter, he would keep Ole\nonly a minute.\n",
                "When Ole came out he saw at once that something serious had happened. He\nasked whether they should go down to the office or take a walk; Tidemand\ndid not care which. They went downstairs to the office.\n",
                "Tidemand took out a telegram and said:\n",

                "It was true that Russia had recalled her decree against rye exportations.\nThe favourable prospects had not proved disappointing, and this, in\nconnection with large amounts of grain stored in the elevators from\nprevious years, had made further restrictions superfluous. The famine\nghost had been laid; Russian and Finnish harbours were once more open.\nSuch was the purport of the telegraphic message.\n",
                "Ole sat there silent. This was an awful blow! His brain was awhirl with\nthoughts: could the telegram be a hoax, a piece of speculative trickery, a\nbribed betrayal? He glanced at the signature; no, it was out of the\nquestion to suspect this reliable agent. But had anything like that ever\nhappened before? A world-power had fooled itself and taken\nself-destructive measures for no apparent reason! It was even worse than\nin fifty-nine when a similar edict had been lifted and had caused the\nworld-markets wreck and ruin. But there had been war then.\n",
                "The clock on the wall ticked and ticked in the unbroken silence.\n",
                "Finally Ole asked: \"Are you sure the wire is authentic?\"\n",
                "\"It is authentic enough, I fancy,\" said Tidemand. \"My agent wired me twice\nyesterday to sell, and I sold what I could, sold even below the day's\nquotations; but what did that amount to? I lost heavily yesterday, I tell\nyou.\"\n",
                "\"Well, don't do anything hastily now; let us consider this carefully. But\nwhy did you not come to me yesterday? I had a right to expect that from\nyou.\"\n",
                "\"I ought hardly to have brought you such a piece of news this evening,\neven, but--\"\n",
                "\"Once and for all,\" Ole interrupted him, \"understand that I will help you\nall I possibly can. With everything I have, you understand. And that is\nnot so very little, either.\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"I thank you, Ole--for everything. I knew I shouldn't go to you in vain.\nYou could help me a good deal if you would take over some of my\nobligations--I mean those that are non-speculative, of course.\"\n",
                "\"Nonsense--anybody will take such things! I am taking rye. We will date\nthe papers day before yesterday--for the sake of the old man.\"\n",
                "Tidemand shook his head.\n",
                "\"I am not going to pull you under, too.\"\n",
                "Ole looked at him; the veins in his temples were swelling. \"You are a damn\nfool!\" he exclaimed angrily.\n",
                "\"Do you for a moment think you can so easily pull me under?\" And Ole\nswore, with blazing eyes, right into Tidemand's face: \"By God, I'll show\nyou how easily you can pull _me_ under!\"\n",
                "But Tidemand was immovable; not even Ole's anger made him yield. He\nunderstood Ole; his means were perhaps not so insignificant, but it was no\nuse making out that he could do everything. Ole boasted only because he\nwanted to help him, that was all. But from to-morrow on the bottom would\nsimply drop out of the market; it wasn't right to sell rye even to one's\nenemies at yesterday's prices.\n",
                "\"But what are you going to do? Are you going into a receiver's hands?\"\nasked Ole in a temper.\n",
                "\"No,\" answered Tidemand, \"I think I can skin through without that. The ice\nin England and Australia is quite a help now; not much, but crowns are\nmoney to me now. I shall have to retrench, to sell what I can in order to\nraise cash. I thought that perhaps you would care to buy--you might use it\nwhen you are going to marry, you know, and we don't need it at all; we are\nnever there any more--\"\n",
                "\"What are you talking about?\"\n",
                "\"Well, I thought that you might want to buy my country estate now--You are\ngoing to be married soon, so--\" \"Your country house? Are you going to\nsell it?\"\n",
                "\"What good is it to us?\"\n",
                "Pause. Ole noticed that Tidemand's composure began to fail him.\n",
                "\"All right. I'll take it. And whenever you want it back it will be for\nsale. I have a premonition that it will not be mine so very long.\"\n",
                "\"Well, God only knows. Anyway, I am doing what I can and should. I am glad\nthe place will be yours. It is beautiful; it is not my fault we have not\nbeen there this summer. Well, this will help some; as for the rest, we'll\nsee. I trust I can manage without closing up; that would be hard indeed.\nAnd worst for the sake of the children!\"\n",
                "Again Ole offered his assistance.\n",
                "\"I appreciate your help, and I will avail myself of it within reasonable\nlimits. But a loss is a loss, and even if I weather the storm without\ngoing into bankruptcy I shall be a poor man all the same. I don't know\nwhether I own a penny now or not--I am only glad that you didn't join me\nin that unhappy speculation, Ole; that is a blessing, anyway. Well, we'll\nsee.\"\n",
                "Ole asked:\n",
                "\"Does your wife know about this?\"\n",
                "\"No; I'll tell her after the trip to-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"The trip? I'll cancel that, of course.\"\n",
                "\"No,\" said Tidemand, \"I will ask you not to do that. Hanka is looking\nforward to it; she has spoken of it a good deal. No, I would rather ask\nyou to act as if nothing has happened; be as cheerful as you can. I really\nwould appreciate it. Don't mention my misfortune at all, please.\"\n",
                "And Tidemand put the fatal wire back in his pocket.\n",
                "\"I am sorry I had to come and bother you with this. But I go home with a\nlighter heart, now I know you will take the country house.\"\n"

                "A party of ladies and gentlemen had gathered on the jetty on the day of\nthe excursion. They were waiting for the Paulsbergs, who were late. Irgens\nwas growing impatient and sarcastic: Would it not be better to send the\nyacht up for them? When finally Paulsberg and his wife arrived, they all\nwent aboard and were soon tacking out the fiord.\n",
                "Tidemand held the tiller. A couple of warehousemen from Henriksen's wharf\nwere along as crew. Ole had arranged the trip carefully and had brought\nalong a choice supply of provisions; he had even remembered roasted coffee\nfor Irgens. But he had failed to find Coldevin, and he had purposely\navoided asking Gregersen; the Journalist might have heard the news from\nRussia, and might inadvertently have betrayed the fatal tidings.\n",
                "Tidemand looked as if he had spent a sleepless night. To Ole's whispered\ninquiry, he answered smilingly that things might be worse. But he asked to\nbe allowed to keep his place at the tiller.\n",
                "And the yacht tacked out toward the reefs.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka had chosen a place far forward; her face was fresh, and she had\nthrown her fur coat around her shoulders; Milde said she looked\npicturesque. He added loudly and gaily:\n",
                "\"And furthermore I wish it were drink time!\"\n",
                "Ole brought out bottles and glasses. He went around and wrapped the ladies\nin shawls and blankets. Nothing to laugh about; true, the day was bright\nand warm, but the sea air was treacherous. He repeatedly offered to\nrelieve Tidemand at the tiller, but was not permitted to. No, this was the\nplace for Tidemand; here he would not have to be entertaining, and he was\nnot in a mood for social amenities.\n",
                "\"Don't lose your nerve whatever happens! Have you heard anything further?\"\n",
                "\"Only a confirmation. We shall get it officially to-morrow, I guess. But\ndon't worry; I have laid my lines now and shall manage to pull through\nsomehow. I imagine I shall save the ship.\"\n",
                "Forward the spirits of the company rose rapidly. Ojen began to get a\nlittle seasick, and drank steadily in order to subdue his qualms.\n",
                "\"It seems good to see you again,\" said Mrs. Hanka, prompted by a desire to\nenliven him. \"You still have your delicate face, but it is not quite as\npale as before you went away.\"\n",
                "\"But what is the matter with your eyes?\" cried Mrs. Paulsberg mercilessly.\n\"I have never seen him as pallid as at this very moment.\"\n",
                "This reference to his seasickness caused general merriment. Mrs. Hanka\ncontinued to speak: She had heard his latest poem, that exquisite gem,\n\"Memories.\" His excursion had certainly been fruitful in results.\n",
                "\"You haven't heard my very latest poem, though,\" said Ojen in a weak\nvoice; \"it has an Egyptian subject; the action takes place in an ancient\ntomb--\" And, sick and miserable as he was, he looked through all his\npockets for this poem. What could have become of it? He had taken it out\nthat morning with the intention of bringing it along; he had thought that\nperhaps somebody would care to listen to it. He was not afraid of saying\nthat it really was a little out of the ordinary. He sincerely hoped he\nhadn't lost it; in that case the trip would have proved most unfortunate\nfor him. Never had he produced anything so remarkable; it was only a\ncouple of pages, but....\n",
                "\"No,\" said Mrs. Hanka, \"you must surely have left it behind.\" And she did\nher best to make the poor poet forget his groundless fears. She had been\ntold that he preferred the city to the country?\n",
                "He did, most assuredly. No sooner had his eyes beheld the straight lines\nof streets and houses than his brain was aquiver, and he had conceived\nthat Egyptian prose poem. If that had been lost, now....\n",
                "Milde had lately begun to appreciate Ojen; at last his eyes had been\nopened to his poetry's delicate uniqueness. Irgens, who sat close enough\nto hear this unusual praise, leaned over to Mrs. Hanka and said in a low\nvoice:\n",
                "\"You understand? Milde knows he has nothing to fear from his competitor\nany more--hence his change of attitude.\" And Irgens pressed his lips\ntogether and smiled venomously.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka glanced at him. How he persisted in his bitterness; how\nunbecoming it was in him! He did not realise it, or he would not have thus\ncompressed his lips and continually shot baleful glances at his fellow\napplicants. Otherwise Irgens was silent; he ignored Aagot entirely. She\nthought: What have I done to him? Could I possibly have acted in any other\nway?\n",
                "The coffee was made on board, but out of regard for Ojen, who still felt\nbadly, it was decided to drink it on the very first reef they should\nreach. They camped on the rocks, flung themselves on the ground, and threw\ndignity to the winds. It was great fun; Ojen looked with big, astonished\neyes at everything--the sea, the waves which filled the air with a\ncontinuous roar, the barren reef where not a tree grew and where the grass\nwas yellow from sun and spray. Aagot skipped round with cups and glasses;\nshe walked in a constant fear of dropping anything and stuck the tip of\nher tongue out like a rope-walker.\n",
                "Milde proposed that they drink her health. \"Haven't you got champagne,\nOle?\" he asked.\n",
                "The champagne was produced, the glasses filled, and the toast drunk amid\ncheers. Milde was in high spirits; he proposed that they throw the bottle\nin the sea with a note enclosed which they all were to sign.\n",
                "They all put their names down except Paulsberg, who curtly refused. A man\nwho wrote as much as he did could not sign his name to nonsensical notes,\nhe said. And he rose and walked away in dignified aloofness.\n",
                "\"Then I'll sign for him,\" said Milde, and seized a pencil.\n",
                "But Mrs. Paulsberg cried indignantly:\n",
                "\"You will do nothing of the kind! Paulsberg has said that he does not want\nhis name on the note, and that ought to be sufficient for all of us.\" She\nlooked quite offended as she crossed her legs and held her cup in her\nusual masculine fashion.\n",
                "Milde apologised instantly; his proposition was meant as a harmless joke;\nhowever, after considering the matter he admitted that perhaps it was a\nlittle foolish and that it would not do for Paulsberg to have anything to\ndo with it. Perhaps they had better drop the whole thing; what did they\nthink? If Paulsberg wasn't going to be in it, then....\n",
                "Irgens could not control himself any longer; he sneered openly and almost\nhissed:\n",
                "\"Mr. Subsidist! You are divine!\"\n",
                "That subsidy was never out of his thoughts.\n",
                "\"And as for you,\" answered Milde scathingly, glaring at him with angry\neyes, \"it is getting so that it is impossible to be near you.\"\n",
                "Irgens feigned surprise.\n",
                "\"What is that? It would appear from your tone that I have offended you.\"\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka had to intervene. Couldn't they stop quarrelling even on a\npleasure trip? They ought to be ducked if they couldn't behave!\n",
                "And Irgens was silent at once; he did not even mumble maliciously between\nhis teeth. Mrs. Hanka grew thoughtful. How her poet and hero had changed\nin a few brief weeks! What had really happened? How dull and lustreless\nhis dark eyes had become! Even his moustache seemed to be drooping; he had\nlost his fresh immaculateness; he was not nearly as alluring as before.\nBut then she reminded herself of his disappointments, of that miserable\nsubsidy, and of his book, his beautiful lyric creation which they were\nconspiring to kill by their studied silence. She leaned toward Aagot and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"It is sad to observe how bitter Irgens has grown; have you noticed it? I\nhope he will get over it soon.\" And Mrs. Hanka, who wanted to save him\nfrom making too unfavourable an impression, added in the goodness of her\nheart what she had heard Irgens himself say so often: It was not so\nstrange, after all; bitterness of that character could only arouse\nrespect. Here he had toiled and worked for years, had given freely of his\ntreasures, and the country, the government, had refused to offer him a\nhelping hand.\n",
                "\"Can you understand it?\" said Aagot also. And she realised instantly that\nshe had not treated this man with the consideration due him; she had been\ntactless; she had rebuffed him with unnecessary harshness. She wished her\nconduct had been different; however, it was too late now.\n",
                "Paulsberg returned from his solitary walk and suggested that it was time\nto think of the return. The clouds held a menace of rain, he said; the sun\nwas sinking and it was blowing up a little.\n",
                "Aagot went around again and poured coffee. She bent over Irgens, bent\ndeeper than necessary, and said:\n",
                "\"May I pour you some, Mr. Irgens?\"\n",
                "The almost supplicating note in her voice made him glance at her in\nsurprise. He did not want any coffee, thanks; but he smiled at her. She\nwas happy at once; she hardly knew what she was carrying, but she\nstammered:\n",
                "\"Just a little, please.\"\n",
                "He looked at her again and said: \"No, thanks.\"\n",
                "On the return trip Irgens seemed a different person. He chatted,\nentertained the ladies, helped even poor Ojen, who suffered greatly. Milde\nhad captured a bottle on the pretext that it was drink time again, and\nIrgens drank with him simply to be accommodating. Mrs. Hanka's spirits\nalso rose; she was lively and cheerful, and a strange association of ideas\nmade her suddenly decide to ask her husband for a couple of hundred crowns\nthis very evening.\n",
                "Tidemand was at the tiller and could not be dislodged; he sailed the boat\nand did not utter a syllable. He looked well as he stood high in the\nstern, rising and falling against the blue background of sea and sky. His\nwife called to him once and asked him if he were cold, an attention he\ncould hardly believe and therefore pretended not to hear.\n",
                "\"He is deaf,\" she said smilingly. \"Are you cold Andreas?\"\n",
                "\"Cold? Not at all,\" he called back.\n",
                "And by and by the party reached the jetty.\n",
                "Hardly had Ojen stepped ashore before he called a cab. He was in a hurry\nto get home and find his manuscript or learn the worst. He could not rest\nuntil he knew his fate. But perhaps he would meet the company later on.\nWould they be at Sara's?\n",
                "They looked at each other uncertainly and did not know what to say. But\nOle Henriksen declared that he was going home; he was thinking of\nTidemand, who was in need of rest and quiet. They parted outside\nTidemand's house.\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka asked abruptly, before even the door was opened:\n",
                "\"Will you please let me have a hundred or so?\"\n",
                "\"A hundred? Hm. Certainly. But you will have to come with me to the\noffice; I haven't got the money here.\"\n",
                "In the office he handed her the bill; his hand was trembling violently.\n",
                "\"Here is the money,\" he said.\n",
                "\"Thanks--Why are you trembling?\" she asked.\n",
                "\"Oh--I suppose because I have held the tiller so long--Hm. Listen, Hanka,\nI have a pleasant surprise for you! You have asked me a number of times to\nconsent to a divorce; I have decided in God's name to do what you ask--You\nunderstand, I am not going to oppose you any more.\"\n",
                "She could hardly believe her ears. Did he agree to a divorce? She gazed at\nhim; he was deathly pale, his eyes were lowered. They were standing\nopposite each other, the large desk between them.\n",
                "He continued:\n",
                "\"Circumstances are different now--My big speculation has failed; even if\nI am not a bankrupt this moment, I am a poor man. I may avoid closing up\nshop, but that will be all. Anyway, I shall not be able to keep up this\nmode of life. And, this being so, I feel that I have no right to interfere\nwith your plans and desires any longer.\"\n",
                "His words reached her as from afar. For a moment she felt a vague\nsensation of happiness--she was free; she would escape the yoke that had\nbecome oppressive; she would be a girl once more! Hanka Lange--imagine,\nonly Hanka Lange! And when she realised that her husband was almost a\nbankrupt it did not greatly upset her; he had said he might not be forced\nto shut down. Of course, he was not wealthy, but neither was he a beggar;\nit might have been a great deal worse.\n",
                "\"Is that so?\" she said simply; \"is that so?\"\n",
                "Pause. Tidemand had regained his composure; he stood again as he had stood\naboard the yacht; one could almost see the tiller in his hand. His eyes\nwere on her. She had not said no; her intentions were evidently not\nshaken. Well, he had hardly expected that they would be.\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"Well, that was all I wanted to tell you.\"\n",
                "His voice was remarkably even, almost commanding; she thought: \"He has not\nspoken to me like that in three years.\" His strength was marvellous to\nbehold.\n",
                "\"Well, do you really want to?\" she asked. \"You think, then, that we ought\nto separate? Of course, but--I hope you have thought it over--that you are\nnot doing this simply to please me?\"\n",
                "\"It goes without saying that I do it to please you,\" he answered. \"You\nhave requested it often enough, and I sincerely regret that I have opposed\nyou until now.\" And he added without a trace of malice: \"You must forgive\nme for having interfered with your wishes so long.\"\n",
                "She grew attentive at once.\n",
                "\"I don't know what you mean,\" she said a trifle haughtily.\n",
                "He did not care about that and did not answer. Hadn't she spoken about a\ndivorce time and time again? Hadn't he put her off? Perfectly composed, he\nopened his coat and took out his pocket calendar, in which he proceeded to\nmake an entry.\n",
                "She could not help being impressed by this quiet superiority, which she\nnever before had noticed in him; she happened to say:\n",
                "\"I think you have changed greatly.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, well, one gets a little grey, but--\"\n",
                "\"No, you misunderstand me!\" she interrupted.\n",
                "Tidemand said slowly and looked straight into her eyes:\n",
                "\"I wish to God you had understood me as well as I have you, Hanka!\nPerhaps, then, this would not have become necessary.\" He buttoned his coat\nas if preparing to leave, and added: \"Now, in regard to the money--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, dear, here is the money!\" she said, and wanted to give him back the\nbill.\n",
                "For the first time since their interview he tossed his head impatiently\nand said:\n",
                "\"I am not talking about _that_ money now! Kindly make at least an\neffort to understand me--Whatever money you need shall be sent you as\nsoon as you inform me where to send it.\"\n",
                "\"But, dear me,\" she said in confusion, \"do I have to go away? I thought I\ncould stay in the city. What do you want me to do?\"\n",
                "\"Whatever is agreeable to you. You will let the children remain here,\nwon't you? I shall take good care of them; you need not worry about that.\nAs for yourself, I suppose you will want to take an apartment somewhere.\nYou know it takes three years, don't you?\"\n",
                "She was standing with the bill in her hand, gazing at it abstractedly. She\nwas unable to think clearly; her mind was whirling; but deep down she had\na vague feeling of relief--she was free at last! She said nothing; he felt\nhis self-control give way and wanted to get it over with quickly so as not\nto break down.\n",
                "\"Good-bye, then--\" He could say no more, but offered her his hand; she\ntook it. \"I hope we shall see each other occasionally; but I want to thank\nyou now for everything; this may be the last chance I shall have--I shall\nsend you the money every month.\" And he put on his hat and went to the\ndoor.\n",
                "She followed him with her eyes. Was this Andreas?\n",
                "\"Well, I suppose you want to go,\" she said, bewildered, \"and I am standing\nhere delaying you. I suppose we shall have to do as you say--I don't know\nwhat I am saying--\" Her voice broke suddenly.\n",
                "Tidemand opened the door with trembling hands and let her out. At the foot\nof the stairs she stopped and let him walk ahead. When he reached the\nlanding he waited for her; then he opened the door with his key and held\nit for her. When she was inside he said:\n",
                "\"Good night, then!\"\n",
                "And again Tidemand walked down-stairs, down to his office, where he shut\nhimself in. He went over to the window and stood there, his hands clasped\nbehind him, staring out into the street with unseeing eyes. No, she had\nnot changed her mind in the least, that was not to be expected. She had\nnot hesitated. There she had stood, with her elbow on the desk; she had\nheard what he said and she had replied; \"Well, I suppose we shall have to\ndo as you say.\" There had been no hesitation, no, none at all.... But she\nhad not exulted, either; she had spared him from witnessing any outburst\nof joy. She had been considerate--he had to admit that. Oh, Hanka was\nalways considerate; God bless her wherever she went! She had stood there.\nHanka, Hanka!... But probably she was rejoicing now; why shouldn't she\nbe? She had had her way.... And the children were asleep now, both Ida and\nJohanna. Poor little things; they did not even reach up to their pillows!\nWell, they would be provided for. One might be getting a little grey, but\nthere was still a fight or two left....\n",

                "Mrs. Hanka looked in vain for Irgens for several days. She had hurried to\nhim to bring him the joyful news; she was free at last! But he was never\nat home. His door was locked, and it was not opened when she knocked;\nconsequently he must be out. She did not meet him in his usual haunts,\neither. Finally she had to write to him and make an appointment; she wrote\nthat she had excellent news for him.\n",
                "But during these two days, these long hours of waiting in which she could\ndo nothing, it seemed as if her joy over the coming divorce had begun to\nwane. She had dwelt on her happiness so long that she had grown accustomed\nto it; it did not make her heart beat faster any more. She was going to be\nfree from her husband--true, but she had not been so entirely shackled\nbefore. The difference was not so pronounced that she could steadily\ncontinue to revel in it.\n",
                "And to this was added an indefinable fear, now when the irrevocable\nseparation confronted her; the thought that she was to leave her home was\ntinged with a vague sense of regretfulness, of impalpable foreboding.\nSometimes a quivering pang would pierce her heart when the children put\nout their little arms to her; why that pain? She had got out of her bed\nlast night and looked at them in their sleep. There they were lying, each\nin her little bed; they had kicked the blankets off and were uncovered up\nto their very arms, but they slept soundly and moved, now and then, a rosy\nfinger or a dimpled toe in their sleep. Such children! To lie there\nunblushingly naked, with arms and legs pointing in all directions! She\ntucked them carefully in and left them with bowed head, her shoulders\nshaken by inaudible sobs.\n",
                "How was she going to arrange her future? She was free, but in reality she\nwas married still; for three years she would have to live somewhere, pay\nrent, keep house for herself. She had worried and fretted about this for\ntwo long days without anyone to help her; what could have happened to\nIrgens? God only knew where he kept himself. She had not once seen her\nformer husband.\n",
                "She started for Irgens's rooms. Surely he would help her find a place and\nget settled! Oh, it was fine to have an end to this daily galling\nrestraint; here she had been tortured by dissatisfaction and restlessness\nfor months and years, ever since she had been introduced to the clique and\nhad acquired a taste for their irresponsible mode of living. She was free,\nfree and young! She would overwhelm Irgens with this joyful news, he who\nhad so often sighed for that divorce during their most intimate hours--\n",
                "Irgens was at home at last.\n",
                "She told him the great news at once. She recounted how it had happened,\nrepeated Tidemand's words, and praised his superiority. She gazed into\nIrgens's eyes; her own were sparkling. Irgens, however, did not show any\ngreat exultation; he smiled, said yes and no, asked her if she were\nsatisfied now. So she was really going to get a divorce? He was glad to\nhear it; it was foolish to go through life in this heart-breaking\nmanner.... But he sat there very quietly and discussed the great news in\nan every-day voice.\n",
                "Gradually, very gradually, she came to earth; her heart began to flutter\nwildly.\n",
                "\"It seems as if the news does not make you so very happy, Irgens,\" she\nsaid.\n",
                "\"Happy? Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be happy? You have sighed for this\nfor a long time; why shouldn't I rejoice with you now? I do, most\nassuredly.\"\n",
                "Words only, without fire, without warmth even! What could have happened?\nDid he not love her any more? She sat there, her heart heavy within her;\nshe wanted to gain time, to hush the wakening terror in her breast. She\nsaid:\n",
                "\"But, dear, where have you been all this time? I have called on you three\ntimes without finding you in.\"\n",
                "He answered, choosing his words carefully, that she must have missed him\nbecause of an unfortunate series of accidents. He went out occasionally,\nof course; but he spent most of his time at home. Where in the world could\nhe go? He went nowhere.\n",
                "Pause. Finally she yielded abjectly to her fears and stammered:\n",
                "\"Well, Irgens, I am yours now, entirely yours! I am going to leave the\nhouse--You will thank me, won't you? It will take three years, of course,\nbut then--\"\n",
                "She stopped suddenly; she felt that he was squirming, that he was bracing\nhimself against the inevitable; her terror increased as he remained\nsilent. A few anguished moments went by.\n",
                "\"Well, Hanka, this is rather unfortunate, in a way,\" he began finally.\n\"You have evidently understood me to mean that when you got your divorce--\nthat if you only were free--Of course, I may have said something to that\neffect; I admit that if you have interpreted my words literally such a\nsupposition is probably justified. I have most likely said things more\nthan once--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, of course,\" she interrupted; \"we have never meant anything else,\nhave we? For you love me, don't you? What is the matter? You are so\nstrange to-day!\"\n",
                "\"I am awfully sorry, but really--things are not as they used to be.\" He\nlooked away sadly and searched for words. \"I cannot lie to you, Hanka, and\nthe plain truth is that I am not enraptured by you as much as I used to\nbe. It would hardly be right to deceive you; anyway, I couldn't do it--it\nis beyond me.\"\n",
                "At last she understood; these were plain words. And quietly bending her\nhead, yielding to the inevitable, letting go of the last lingering hope,\nshe whispered in a dull and broken voice:\n",
                "\"Couldn't do it; no--It is all over, irrevocably over--\"\n",
                "He sat there silent.\n",
                "Suddenly she turned and looked at him. Her white teeth showed beneath the\nslightly raised upper lip as she endeavoured to force a smile. She said\nslowly:\n",
                "\"But surely it cannot all be over, Irgens? Remember, I have sacrificed a\ngreat deal--\"\n",
                "But he shook his head.\n",
                "\"Yes, I am awfully sorry, but--Do you know what I was thinking of just now\nwhen I didn't answer you? You said 'irrevocably over.' I was wondering if\nthat was proper grammar, if it sounded right. That shows how little this\nscene really affects me; you can see for yourself that I am not beside\nmyself with grief--not even deeply stirred. That ought to show you--\" And\nas if he wanted to utilise the opportunity to the utmost and leave no room\nfor doubt, he continued: \"Did you say that you have been here three times,\nlooking for me? I know that you have been here twice. I think I ought to\ntell you, so that you can see how impossible it is for me to pretend: I\nsat here and heard you knock, but I didn't open. That surely proves the\nmatter is serious--Dearest Hanka, I cannot help it; really, you mustn't\nbe unhappy. But you surely will admit that our relationship must have been\na little galling, a little humiliating, to me as well? It is true; it has\nnot been easy for me to accept money from you continually; I have said to\nmyself: 'This degrades you!' You understand, don't you--a man with a\nnature like mine; unhappily, I am proud, whether it is a virtue or a vice\nin me--\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"All right,\" she said mechanically, \"all right.\" And she rose in order to\ngo. Her eyes were wide and staring, but she saw nothing.\n",
                "However, he wanted to explain himself thoroughly; she must not leave with\na wrong impression of him. He called her back; he wanted to prove why it\ncould not have been otherwise, why his conduct was beyond reproach. He\nspoke at length and cleared up the matter perfectly; it seemed as if he\nhad expected this and had prepared himself thoroughly. There were a number\nof bagatelles; but it was just the little things that counted with a man\nlike him, and these little things had gradually made it so clear to him\nthat they were not compatible. Of course, she was fond of him, a great\ndeal more so than he deserved; but all the same he was not sure that she\nunderstood and appreciated him fully. This was not said reproachfully,\nbut--She had said that she was proud of him, and that she enjoyed seeing\nthe ladies turn and look after him when they walked down the street\ntogether. All right! But that did not prove that she valued his\nindividuality. She took no pride in the fact that he was, above all, a\nsomewhat different individuality. Of course, he did not blame her; but,\nunfortunately, it proved that her understanding of him was not deep\nenough. She was not proud of him for what he had thought or written; not\nprimarily, at any rate; she loved to see the ladies look after him on the\nstreet. But ladies might turn and look after anybody, even after an\nofficer or a tradesman. She had once given him a cane so that he might\nlook well on the street....\n",
                "\"No, Irgens, I had no such thought, not at all,\" she interrupted.\n",
                "All right, he might have been mistaken; if she said so, of course....\nNevertheless, he had the impression that such was her reason. He had\nthought that if he couldn't pass muster without a cane, then.... For even\nthose two sheared sheep of Ojen's used a cane. In brief, he gave the cane\naway to the first comer.... But there were other little things, other\nbagatelles: She liked to go to the opera; he didn't. She went without him,\nand he was very much pleased, of course; still.... She wore a light\nwoollen dress, and when he was with her his clothes got full of fuzz from\nher dress, but she never noticed it. He had to brush and pick fuzz\nunceasingly to avoid looking as if he had been in bed fully dressed; but\ndid she notice? Never. And in this manner one thing after another had come\nbetween them and had affected his feelings for her. There were hundreds of\nlittle things! A little while ago her lips had been so badly cracked that\nshe couldn't even smile naturally; and just think, an insignificant thing\nlike that had repulsed him, absolutely spoiled her for him! Dear me, she\nmust not think that he found fault with her because of a cracked lip; he\nknew very well that she could not help such a thing; he was not\nstupid.... But the truth of the matter was that it had reached a point\nwhere he was beginning to dread her visits. He had to admit it; he had sat\non this very chair and suffered, suffered tortures, when he heard her\nknock on the door. However, no sooner had she gone away than he felt\nrelieved; he got ready and went out, too. He went to some restaurant and\ndined, dined unfeelingly and with a good appetite, not at all deploring\nwhat he had done. He wanted her to know these things so that she would\nunderstand him.... \"But, dearest Hanka, I have told you all this and\nperhaps added to your sorrow instead of alleviating it. I wanted you to\nsee how necessary has become our parting--that there are deep and weighty\nreasons for it--that it is not merely a whim. Unfortunately, these things\nare deeply rooted in my nature--But don't take it so to heart! You know I\nam fond of you and appreciate all you have done for me; and I shall never\nbe able to forget you; I feel that only too well. Tell me that you will\ntake it calmly--that is all I ask--\"\n",
                "She sat there, dull and immobile. Her premonition had not deceived her; it\nwas all over. There he sat; he had spoken about this and that and\nremembered this and that--everything that could possibly explain and\njustify his actions. He had said a great deal, he had even bared himself\nin spots; yes, how penuriously hadn't he scraped up the least little thing\nthat might vindicate him in the slightest degree! How could she ask him to\nadvise her? He would simply refer her to the newspaper advertisements:\n\"Flats and Apartments to Let.\" How insignificant he suddenly appeared!\nSlowly he blurred before her eyes; he was blotted out; he became lost in\nthe dim distance; she saw him as through a haze; she barely discerned his\nmother-of-pearl buttons and his sleek and shiny hair. She realised how her\neyes had been opened during his long speech; there he sat.... She felt\nlanguidly that she ought to go, but she lacked the energy to get up. She\nfelt hollow and empty; the last little illusion to which she had clung so\ntenaciously had collapsed miserably. Somebody's step sounded on the\nstairs; she did not remember whether or no the door was locked, but she\ndid not go and make sure. The steps died down again; nobody knocked.\n",
                "\"Dearest Hanka,\" he said in an effort to console her as best he might,\n\"you ought to start in in earnest and write that novel we have talked\nabout. I am sure you could do it, and I will gladly go over the manuscript\nfor you. The effort, the concentration would do you good; you know I want\nto see you content and satisfied.\"\n",
                "Yes, once upon a time, she had really thought she would write a novel. Why\nnot? _Here_ one miss bobbed up, and _there_ another madam bobbed\nup, and they all did write so cutely! Yes, she had really thought that it\nwas her turn next. And how they all had encouraged her! Thank God, she had\nforgotten about it until now!\n",
                "\"You do not answer, Hanka?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said absently, \"there is something in what you say.\"\n",
                "She got up suddenly and stood erect staring straight ahead. If she only\nknew what to do now! Go home? That would probably be the best. Had she had\nparents she would most likely have gone to them; however, she had never\nhad any parents, practically. She had better go home to Tidemand, where\nshe still lived....\n",
                "And with a desolate smile she gave Irgens her hand and said farewell.\n",
                "He felt so relieved because of her calmness that he pressed her hand\nwarmly. What a sensible woman she was, after all! No hysterics, no\nheartrending reproaches; she said farewell with a smile! He wanted to\nbrace her still more and talked on in order to divert her mind; he\nmentioned his work and plans; he would surely send her his next book; she\nwould find him again in that. And, really, she ought to get busy on that\nnovel.... To show her that their friendship was still unbroken he even\nasked her to speak to Gregersen about that review of his book. It was most\nextraordinary that his verses had attracted so little attention. If she\nwould only do him this favour. He himself would never be able to approach\nGregersen; he was too proud; he could never stoop to that....\n",
                "She went over to the mirror and began arranging her hair. He could not\nhelp watching her; she really surprised him a little. It was of course\nadmirable in her to keep her feelings in leash; still, this unruffled\ncomposure was not altogether _au fait_. He had really credited her\nwith a little more depth; he had ventured to think that a settlement with\nhim would affect her somewhat. And there she stood tranquilly and arranged\nher hair with apparent unconcern! He could not appreciate such a display\nof _sang-froid_. To tell the truth, he felt snubbed; and he made the\nremark that he was still present; it seemed peculiar that she had already\nso completely forgotten him....\n",
                "She did not answer. But when she left the mirror she paused for a moment\nin the middle of the room, and with her eyes somewhere in the vicinity of\nhis shoes, she said wearily and indifferently:\n",
                "\"Don't you understand that I am entirely through with you?\"\n",
                "But in the street, bathed in the bright sunshine, surrounded by people and\ncarriages--there her strength gave way entirely and she began to sob\nwildly. She covered her face with her veil, and sought the\nleast-frequented side-streets in order to avoid meeting anybody; she\nwalked hurriedly, stooping, shaken by convulsive sobs. How densely dark\nthe outlook whichever way she turned her eyes! She hurried on, walking in\nthe middle of the street, talking to herself in a choked voice. Could she\nreturn to Andreas and the children? What if the door should be closed\nagainst her? She had wasted two days; perhaps Andreas now had grown\nimpatient. Still, the door might be open if she only hurried....\n",
                "Every time she took out her handkerchief she felt the crinkle of an\nenvelope. That was the envelope with the hundred-crown bill; she still had\nthat! Oh--if she only had somebody to go to now, a friend--not any of her\n\"friends\" from the clique; she was through with them! She had been one of\nthem a year and a day; she had listened to their words and she had seen\ntheir deeds. How had she been able to endure them? Thank God, she was done\nwith them forever. Could she go to Ole Henriksen and ask help from him?\nNo, no; she couldn't do that.\n",
                "Andreas would probably be busy in his office. She had not seen him for two\ndays; very likely it was an accident, but it was so. And she had accepted\na hundred crowns from him, although he was ruined! Dear me, that she\nhadn't thought of this before now! She had asked him for that money.\n\"Yes,\" he had said; \"will you please come into the office? I have not so\nmuch with me.\" And he had opened his safe and given her the hundred;\nperhaps it was all the money he had! He had proffered the bill in such a\ngentle and unobtrusive manner, although, perhaps, it was all the money he\nowned! His hair had turned a little grey and he looked as if he hadn't had\nmuch sleep lately; but he had not complained; his words were spoken in\nproud and simple dignity. It had seemed as if she saw him then for the\nfirst time.... Oh, would that she never had asked him for this money!\nPerhaps he might forgive her if she brought it back. Would she bother him\nvery much if she stopped at his office a moment? She would not stay\nlong....\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka dried her eyes beneath her veil and walked on. When at last she\nstood outside Tidemand's office she hesitated. Suppose he turned her out?\nPerhaps he even knew where she had been?\n",
                "A clerk told her that Tidemand was in.\n",
                "She knocked and listened. He called: \"Come in.\" She entered quietly. He\nwas standing at his desk; he put down his pen when he saw her.\n",
                "\"Pardon me if I disturb you,\" she said hurriedly.\n",
                "\"Not at all,\" he said, and waited. A pile of letters was before him; he\nstood there, tall and straight; he did not look so very grey, and his eyes\nwere not so listless.\n",
                "She took the bill out and held it toward him.\n",
                "\"I only wanted to return this; and please forgive me for asking for money\nwhen I might have known that you must need it so badly. I never thought of\nit until now; I am extremely sorry.\"\n",
                "He looked at her in surprise and said:\n",
                "\"Not at all--you just keep that! A hundred more or less means nothing to\nthe business--nothing at all.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, but--please take it! I ask you to take it.\"\n",
                "\"All right, if you don't need it. I thank you, but it is not necessary.\"\n",
                "He had thanked her! What a fortunate thing that she had the money and\ncould give it back to him! But she suppressed her agitation and said\n\"Thank you\" herself as she shoved the bill over toward him. When she saw\nhim reach for his pen again, she said with a wan smile:\n",
                "\"You must not be impatient because of this long delay--I have made very\nlittle progress in the matter of taking an apartment, but--\"\n",
                "She could control herself no longer; her voice broke entirely and she\nturned away from him, fumbling for her handkerchief with trembling\nfingers.\n",
                "\"There is no great hurry about that,\" he said. \"Take all the time you\nwant.\"\n",
                "\"I thank you.\"\n",
                "\"You thank me? I don't quite understand. It isn't I who--I am simply\ntrying to make it easy for you to have your own way.\"\n",
                "She was afraid she had irritated him, and she said hastily:\n",
                "\"Of course, yes! Oh, I didn't mean--Pardon me for disturbing you.\"\n",

And who had even\nheard of such a crazily hazardous speculation as Tidemand's fatal plunge\nin rye! Everybody could see that now, and everybody pitied or scorned him\naccording to his individual disposition. Tidemand let them talk; he\nworked, calculated, made arrangements, and kept things going. True, he\nheld in storage an enormous supply of rye which he had bought too high:\nbut rye was rye, after all; it did not deteriorate or shrink into\nnothingness; he sold it steadily at prevailing prices and took his losses\nlike a man.

                "Ole looked at him steadily. What could be the matter with Tidemand? His\neyes had become cold and steely; he put down his glass hard. Gossip? Of\ncourse not. Tidemand did not carry gossip, but his mind must have become\naffected.\n",
                "\"Well, you may be right if you mean that this kind of thing may lead to\nunpleasant comment, to gossip,\" Ole said finally. \"I really have not given\nit a thought, but now you mention it--I will give Aagot a hint the first\nopportunity I have.\"\n",
                "Nothing further was said on the subject; the conversation swung back to\nTidemand's affairs.\n",
                "How was it--did he still take his meals in restaurants?\n",
                "He did for the present. What else could he do? He would have to stick to\nthe restaurants for a while, otherwise the gossips would finish poor Hanka\naltogether. People would simply say that she was to blame if he hadn't\nkept house the last few years; no sooner had she departed than Tidemand\nagain went to housekeeping and stayed at home. Nobody knew what\nconstruction might be put on such things; Hanka did not have too many\nfriends. Tidemand laughed at the thought that he was fooling the\nslanderous tongues so capitally. \"She came to see me a couple of days ago;\nI was in my office. I thought at first it was some bill-collector, some\ndun or other, who knocked at my door; but it was Hanka. Can you guess what\nshe wanted? She came to give me a hundred crowns! She had probably saved\nthe money. Of course, you might say that it really was my own money; you\n_might_ say that. Still, she could have kept it; but she knew I was a\nlittle pinched--She hasn't gone out at all the last few days; I am at a\nloss to know how she is keeping alive. I don't see her, but the maid says\nshe eats in her room sometimes. She is working, too; she is busy all the\ntime.\"\n",
                "\"It wouldn't surprise me at all to see her stay with you. Things may turn\nout all right yet.\"\n",
                "Tidemand glanced at his friend sharply.\n",
                "\"You believe that? Wasn't it you who once said that I was no glove to be\npicked up or thrown away according to some one's fancy? Well, she has\nprobably no more thought of coming back than I have of accepting her.\"\n",
                "And Tidemand rose quickly and said good-bye; he was going to the bank and\nhad to hurry.\n",
                "Ole remained lost in contemplation; Tidemand's fate had made him\nthoughtful. What had become of Aagot? She had promised to be back in an\nhour, and it was much more than two hours since she had left. Of course,\nit was all right to take a walk, but.... Tidemand was right. Tidemand had\nhis own thoughts, he had said; what could he have meant? Suddenly a\nthought struck Ole--perhaps Irgens was the destroyer of Tidemand's home,\nthe slayer of his happiness? A red tie? Didn't Irgens use a red tie once?\n",
                "Suddenly Ole understood Tidemand's previous significant remark about the\ndanger of boat-rides in May. Well, well! Come to think of it, Aagot\n_had_ really seemed to lose the desire to be with him in the office\nearly and late; instead, she took a good many walks in good company; she\nwanted to view things and places in this good company.... Hadn't she once\nexpressed a regret that he was not a poet? Still, she had apologised for\nthat remark with such sweet and regretful eagerness; it was a thoughtless\njest. No; Aagot was innocent as a child; still, for his sake, she might\nrefuse an occasional invitation from Irgens....\n",
                "Another long hour went by before Aagot returned. Her face was fresh and\nrosy, her eyes sparkling. She threw her arms around Ole's neck; she always\ndid that when she had been with Irgens. Ole's misgivings dissolved and\nvanished in this warm embrace; how could he reproach her now? He only\nasked her to stay around the house a little more--for his sake. It was\nsimply unbearable to be without her so long; he could do nothing but think\nof her all the time.\n",
                "Aagot listened quietly to him; he was perfectly right; she would remember.\n",
                "\"And perhaps I might as well ask another favour of you: please try to\navoid Irgens's company a little more, just a little more. I don't mean\nanything, you know; but it would be better not to give people the least\ncause for talk. Irgens is my friend, and I am his, but--Now, don't mind\nwhat I have said--\"\n",
                "She took his head in both her hands and turned his face toward her. She\nlooked straight into his eyes and said:\n",
                "\"Do you doubt that I love you, Ole?\"\n",
                "He grew confused; he was too close to her. He stammered and took a step\nbackward.\n",
                "\"Love me? Ha, ha, you silly girl! Did you think I was chiding you? You\nmisunderstood me; I thought only of what people might say; I want to\nprotect you from gossip. But it is silly of me; I should have said\nnothing--you might even take it into your head to avoid going out with\nIrgens in the future! And that would never do; then people would surely\nbegin to wonder. No; forget this and act as if nothing had been said;\nreally, Irgens is a rare and a remarkable man.\"\n",
                "However, she felt the need of explaining matters: she went just as gladly\nwith anybody else as with Irgens; it had only happened that he had asked\nher. She admired him; she would not deny that, and she was not alone in\nthat; she pitied him a little, too; imagine, he had applied for a subsidy\nand had been refused! She felt sorry for him, but that was all....\n",
                "\"Say no more about it!\" cried Ole. \"Let everything remain as it is--\" It\nwas high time to think a little of the wedding; it was not too early to\nmake definite arrangements. As soon as he returned from that trip to\nEngland he would be ready. And he thought it would be best for her to go\nhome to Torahus while he was away; when everything was in order he would\ncome up for her. Their wedding trip would have to be postponed until\nspring; he would be too busy until then.\n",
                "Aagot smiled happily and agreed to everything. A vague, inexplicable wish\nhad sprung up within her: she would have liked to remain in the city until\nhe should return from England; then they could have gone to Torahus\ntogether. She did not know when or where this strange desire had been born\nin her, and it was, for that matter, not sufficiently clear or definite to\nbe put in words; she would do as Ole wished. She told Ole to make haste\nand return; her eyes were open and candid; she spoke to him with one arm\non his shoulder and the other resting on the desk.\n",
                "And he had presumed to give _her_ a hint!\n"

                "Over a week went by before Irgens turned up again. Had he become\nsuspicious? Or had he simply tired of Aagot? However, he entered Ole's\noffice one afternoon; the weather was clear and sunny, but it was blowing\nhard and the dust whirled through the streets in clouds and eddies. He was\nin doubt whether Miss Aagot would want to go out on such a day, and for\nthis reason he said at once:\n",
                "\"It is a gloriously windy day, Miss Aagot; I should like to take you up on\nthe hills, up to the high places! You have never seen anything like it;\nthe town is shrouded in dust and smoke.\"\n",
                "At any other time Ole would have said no; it was neither healthy nor\nenjoyable to be blown full of dust. But now he wanted to show Aagot that\nhe was not thinking of their recent conversation.... Certainly; run\nalong! Really, she ought to take this walk.\n",
                "And Aagot went.\n",
                "\"It is an age since I have seen you,\" said Irgens.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am busy nowadays. I am going home soon.\"\n",
                "\"You are?\" he asked quickly and stopped.\n",
                "\"Yes. I am coming back, though.\"\n",
                "Irgens had become thoughtful.\n",
                "\"I am afraid it is blowing a little too hard, after all,\" he said. \"We can\nhardly hear ourselves think. Suppose we go to the Castle Park? I know a\ncertain place--\"\n",
                "\"As you like,\" she said.\n",
                "They found the place; it was sheltered and isolated. Irgens said:\n",
                "\"To be entirely candid, it was not my intention to drag you up into the\nhills to-day. The truth of the matter is that I was afraid you would not\ncare to come; that is the reason I said what I said. For I _had_ to\nsee you once more.\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"Really--I have ceased to wonder at anything you say.\"\n",
                "\"But think--it is ten days since I have seen you! That is a long, a very\nlong time.\"\n",
                "\"Well--that is not altogether my fault--But don't let us talk about it any\nmore,\" she added quickly. \"Rather tell me--why do you still act toward me\nin this manner? It is wrong of you. I have told you that before. I should\nlike to be friends with you, but--\"\n",
                "\"But no more. I understand. However, that is hardly sufficient for one who\nis distracted with suffering, you know. No, you do not know; you have\nnever known. Ever and ever one must circle around the forbidden; it\nbecomes a necessity continually to face one's fate. If, for instance, I\nhad to pay for a moment like this with age-long wreck and ruin, why, I\nwould gladly pay the price. I would rather be with you here one brief\nmoment, Miss Aagot, than live on for years without you.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, but--It is too late now, you know. Why talk about it, then? You only\nmake it so much harder for us both.\"\n",
                "He said, slowly and emphatically:\n",
                "\"No, it is not too late.\"\n",
                "She looked at him steadily and rose to her feet; he, too, got up; they\nwalked on. Immersed in their own thoughts, without conscious realisation\nof what they were doing, walking slowly, they made the circuit of the park\nand returned to their sheltered nook. They sat down on the same bench.\n",
                "\"We are walking in a circle,\" he said. \"That is the way I am circling\naround you.\"\n",
                "\"Listen,\" she said, and her eyes were moist, \"this is the last time I\nshall be with you, probably. Won't you be nice? I am going home, you know,\nvery soon now.\"\n",
                "But just as he was preparing to answer her out of the fullness of his\nheart somebody had to pass their seat. It was a lady. In one hand she\ncarried a twig with which she struck her skirt smartly for every step she\ntook. She approached them slowly; they saw that she was young. Irgens knew\nher; he got up from his seat, took off his hat, and bowed deeply.\n",
                "And the lady passed blushingly by.\n",
                "Aagot asked:\n",
                "\"Who was that?\"\n",
                "\"Only my landlady's daughter,\" he said. \"You told me to be nice. Yes,\ndearest--\"\n",
                "But Aagot wanted further information concerning this lady. So they lived\nin the same house? What was she doing? What kind of a person was his\nlandlady?\n",
                "And Irgens answered her fully. Just as if she were a child whose curiosity\nhad been aroused by the merest chance occurrence, Aagot made him tell her\neverything he knew concerning these strange people in Thranes Road No. 5.\nShe wondered why the lady had blushed; why Irgens had greeted her so\nobsequiously. She did not know that this was the way Irgens always paid\nhis rent--by being particularly gracious to his landlady's family on the\nstreet.\n",
                "The young lady was good-looking, although she had a few freckles. She was\nreally pretty when she blushed; didn't he think so?\n",
                "And Irgens agreed; she was pretty. But she didn't have one only dimple;\nthere was only one who had that....\n",
                "Aagot glanced at him quickly; his voice thrilled her; she closed her eyes.\nThe next instant she felt that she was bending toward him, that he kissed\nher. Neither spoke; all her fears were lulled; she ceased to struggle and\nrested deliciously in his arms.\n",
                "And nobody disturbed them. The wind soughed through the trees; it hushed\nand soothed.... Somebody came along; they rushed apart and kept their eyes\non the gravelled walk while he passed. Aagot was quite equal to the\noccasion; she did not show the slightest trace of confusion. She got up\nand began to walk away. And now she began to think; the tears were\ndripping from her long lashes, and she whispered, dully, despairingly:\n",
                "\"God forgive me! What have I done?\"\n",
                "Irgens wanted to speak, to say something that would soften her despair. It\nhad happened because it had to happen. He was so unspeakably fond of her;\nshe surely knew he was in earnest.... And he really looked as if he were\ngreatly in earnest.\n",
                "But Aagot heard nothing; she walked on, repeating these desperate words.\nInstinctively she took the way down toward the city. It seemed as if she\nwere hurrying home.\n",
                "\"Dearest Aagot, listen a moment--\"\n",
                "She interrupted violently:\n",
                "\"Be quiet, will you!\"\n",
                "And he was silent.\n",
                "Just as they emerged from the park a violent gust tore her hat from her\nhair. She made an effort to recover it, but too late; it was blown back\ninto the park. Irgens caught up with it as it was flattened against a\ntree.\n",
                "She stood still for a moment; then she, too, began to run in pursuit, and\nwhen at last they met by the tree her despair was less poignant. Irgens\nhanded her the hat, and she thanked him. She looked embarrassed.\n",
                "As they were walking down the sloping driveway toward the street the wind\nmade Aagot turn and walk backward a few steps. Suddenly she stopped. She\nhad discovered Coldevin; he was walking through the park in the direction\nof Tivoli. He walked hurriedly, furtively, and as if he did not want to be\nseen. So he was still in the city!\n",
                "And Aagot thought in sudden terror: What if he has seen us! As in a flash\nshe understood. He was coming from the park; he had wanted to wait until\nthey should have had time to reach the street; then the accident with her\nhat had spoiled his calculations and made him show himself too soon. How\nhe stooped and squirmed! But he could find no hiding-place on this open\ndriveway.\n",
                "Aagot called to him, but the wind drowned her voice. She waved her hand,\nbut he pretended not to see it; he did not bow. And without another word\nto Irgens she ran after him, down the slope. The wind blew her skirts to\nher knees; she grabbed her hat with one hand and ran. She caught up with\nhim by the first cross-street.\n",
                "He stopped and greeted her as usual--awkwardly, with an expression of\nmelancholy gladness, moved in every fibre of his being. He was miserably\ndressed.\n",
                "\"You--You must not come here and spy on me,\" she said hoarsely, all out of\nbreath. She stood before him, breathing hard, angry, with flashing eyes.\n",
                "His lips parted but he could not speak; he did not know which way to turn.\n",
                "\"Do you hear me?\"\n",
                "\"Yes--Have you been sick, perhaps? You haven't been out for two weeks now;\nof course, I don't _know_ that you haven't, but--\"\n",
                "His helpless words, his wretched embarrassment, moved her; her anger died\ndown, she was again on the verge of tears, and, deeply humiliated, she\nsaid:\n",
                "\"Dear Coldevin, forgive me!\"\n",
                "She asked him to forgive her! He did not know what to say to this, but\nanswered abstractedly:\n",
                "\"Forgive you? We won't speak about that--But why are you crying? I wish I\nhadn't met you--\"\n",
                "\"But I am glad I met you,\" she said. \"I wanted to meet you; I think of you\nalways, but I never see you--I long for you often.\"\n",
                "\"Well, we won't speak about that, Miss Aagot. You know we have settled our\naffair. I can only wish you every happiness, every possible happiness.\"\n",
                "Coldevin had apparently regained his self-control; he commenced even to\nspeak about indifferent matters: Was not this a fearful storm? God knew\nhow the ships on the high seas were faring!\n",
                "She listened and answered. His composure had its effect on her, and she\nsaid quietly:\n",
                "\"So you are still in the city. I shall not ask you to come and see me;\nthat would be useless. Ole and I both wanted to ask you to come with us on\na little excursion, but you could not be found.\"\n",
                "\"I have seen Mr. Henriksen since then. I explained that I was engaged that\nSunday anyway. I was at a party, a little dinner--So everything is well\nwith you?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, thanks.\"\n",
                "Again she was seized with fear. What if he had been in the park and seen\neverything? She said as indifferently as she could: \"See how the trees are\nswaying in the park! I suppose, though, there must be sheltered places\ninside.\"\n",
                "\"In the park? I don't know. I haven't been there--But your escort is\nwaiting for you; isn't it Irgens?\"\n",
                "Thank God, she was saved! He had not been in the park. She heard nothing\nelse. Irgens was getting tired of this waiting, but she did not care. She\nturned again to Coldevin.\n",
                "\"So you have seen Ole since the excursion? I wonder why he hasn't\nmentioned it to me.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, he cannot remember everything. He has a lot to think of, Miss Aagot;\na great deal. He is at the head of a big business; I was really surprised\nwhen I saw how big it is. Wonderful! A man like him must be excused if he\nforgets a little thing like that. If you would permit me to say a word, he\nloves you better than anybody else! He--Please remember that! I wanted so\nmuch to say this to you!\"\n",
                "These few words flew straight to her heart. In a flash she saw the image\nof Ole, and she exclaimed joyously:\n",
                "\"Yes, it is true! Oh, when I think of everything--I am coming!\" she called\nto Irgens and waved her hand at him.\n",
                "She said good-bye to Coldevin and left him.\n",
                "She seemed to be in a great hurry; she asked Irgens to pardon her for\nhaving kept him waiting, but she walked on rapidly.\n",
                "\"Why this sudden haste?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"Oh, I must get home. What a nasty wind!\"\n",
                "\"Aagot!\"\n",
                "She shot him a swift glance; his voice had trembled; she felt a warm glow\nthroughout her being. No, she couldn't make herself colder than she was;\nher eyes drooped again and she leaned toward him; her arm brushed his\nsleeve.\n",
                "He spoke her name again with infinite tenderness, and she yielded.\n",
                "\"Give me a little time, please! Whatever shall I do? I will love you if\nyou will only let me alone now.\"\n",
                "He was silent.\n",
                "Finally they reached the last crossing. Ole Henriksen's house could be\nseen in the distance. The sight of that house seemed to bring her to her\nsenses. Whatever could she have said? Had she promised anything? No, no,\nnothing! And she said with averted eyes:\n",
                "\"That which has happened to-day--your having kissed me--I regret it; God\nknows I do! I grieve over it--\"\n",
                "\"Then pronounce the sentence!\" he answered briskly.\n",
                "\"No, I cannot punish you, but I give you my hand in promise that I will\ntell Ole if you ever dare do that again.\"\n",
                "And she gave him her hand.\n",
                "He took it, pressed it; he bent over it, and kissed it repeatedly,\ndefiantly, right below her own windows. Covered with confusion, she\nfinally succeeded in opening the door and escaping up the stairs.\n"

He happened to see a long\nentry in the ledger which was lying open on his desk. It was Irgens's\naccount. Tidemand glanced at it indifferently; old loans, bad debts, wine\nand loans, wine and cash. The entries were dated several years back; there\nwere none during the last year. Irgens had never made any payments; the\ncredit column was clean. Tidemand still remembered how Irgens used to joke\nabout his debts. He did not conceal that he owed his twenty thousand; he\nadmitted it with open and smiling face. What could he do? He had to live.\nIt was deplorable that circumstances forced him into such a position. He\nwished it were different and he would have been sincerely grateful if\nanybody had come along and paid his debts, but so far nobody had offered\nto do that. Well, he would say, that could not be helped; he would have to\ncarry his own burdens. Fortunately, most of his creditors were people with\nsufficient culture and delicacy to appreciate his position; they did not\nlike to dun him; they respected his talent. But occasionally it would\nhappen that a tailor or a wine-dealer would send him a bill and as like as\nnot spoil an exquisite mood. He simply must open his door whenever anybody\nknocked, even if he were just composing some rare poem. He had to answer,\nto expostulate: What, another bill? Well, put it there, and I will look at\nit some time when I need a piece of paper. Oh, it is receipted? Well, then\nI will have to refuse to accept it; I never have receipted bills lying\nround. Take it back with my compliments....\n",
                "Tidemand walked back and forth. An association of ideas made him think of\nHanka and the divorce. God knows what she was waiting for; she kept to\nherself and spent all her time with the children, sewing slips and dresses\nall day long. He had met her on the stairs once; she was carrying some\ngroceries in a bundle; she had stepped aside and muttered an excuse. They\nhad not spoken to each other.\n",
                "What could she be thinking of? He did not want to drive her away, but this\ncould not continue. He was at a loss to understand why she took her meals\nat home; she never went to a restaurant. Dear me, perhaps she had no more\nmoney! He had sent the maid to her once with a couple of hundred crowns--\nthey could not last for ever! He glanced in his calendar and noticed that\nit was nearly a month since he had had that settlement with Hanka; her\nmoney must have been used up long ago. She had probably even bought things\nfor the children with that money.\n",
                "Tidemand grew hot all of a sudden. At least _she_ should never lack\nanything; thank God, one wasn't a pauper exactly! He took out all the\nmoney he could spare, left the office, and went up-stairs. The maid told\nhim that Hanka was in her own little room, the middle room facing the\nstreet. It was four o'clock.\n",
                "He knocked and entered.\n",
                "Hanka sat at the table, eating. She rose quickly.\n",
                "\"Oh--I thought it was the maid,\" she stammered. Her face coloured and she\nglanced uneasily at the table. She began to clear away, to place napkins\nover the dishes. She moved the chairs and said again and again: \"I did not\nknow--everything is so upset--\"\n",
                "But he asked her to excuse his abrupt entrance. He only wanted to--she\nmust have been in need of money, of course she must; it couldn't be\notherwise; he wouldn't hear any more about it. Here--he had brought a\nlittle for her present needs. And he placed the envelope on the table.\n",
                "She refused to accept it. She had plenty of money left. She took out the\nlast two hundred crowns he had sent her and showed him the bills. She even\nwanted to return them.\n",
                "He looked at her in amazement. He noticed that her left hand was without\nthe ring. He frowned and asked:\n",
                "\"What has become of your ring, Hanka?\"\n",
                "\"It isn't the one you gave me,\" she answered quickly. \"It is the other\none. That doesn't matter.\"\n",
                "\"I did not know you had been obliged to do that, or I would long ago--\"\n",
                "\"But I was not obliged to do it; I wanted to. You see I have plenty of\nmoney. But it does not matter in the least, for I still have _your_\nring.\"\n",
                "\"Well, whether it is my ring or not, you have not done me a favour by\nthis. I want you to keep your things. I am not so altogether down and out,\neven if I have had to let some of my help go.\"\n",
                "She bowed her head. He walked over to the window; when he turned back he\nnoticed that she was looking at him; her eyes were candid and open. He\ngrew confused and turned his back to her again. No, he could not speak to\nher of moving now; let her stay on awhile if she wanted to. But he would\nat least try to persuade her to cease this strange manner of living; there\nwas no sense in that; besides, she was getting thin and pale.\n",
                "\"Don't be offended, but ought you not--Not for my sake, of course, but for\nyour own--\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I know,\" she interrupted, afraid of letting him finish; \"time\npasses, and I haven't moved yet.\"\n",
                "He forgot what he intended to say about her housekeeping eccentricities;\nhe caught only her last words.\n",
                "\"I cannot understand you. You have had your way; nothing binds you any\nmore. You can be Hanka Lange now as much as you like; you surely know that\nI am not holding you back.\"\n",
                "\"No,\" she answered. She rose and took a step toward him. She held out her\nhand to him in a meaningless way, and when he did not take it, she dropped\nit to her side limply, with burning cheeks. She sank into her chair again.\n",
                "\"No, you are not holding me back--I wanted to ask you--Of course, I have\nno right to expect that you will let me, but if you would--if I could\nremain here awhile yet? I would not be as I was before--I have changed a\ngood deal, and so have you. I cannot say what I want to--\"\n",
                "His eyes blurred suddenly. What did she mean? For a moment he faltered;\nthen he buttoned his coat and straightened his shoulders. Had he, then,\nsuffered in vain during all these weary days and nights? Hardly! He would\nprove it now. Hanka was sitting there, but evidently she was beside\nherself; he had excited her by calling on her so \"unexpectedly\".\n",
                "\"Don't excite yourself, Hanka. Perhaps you are saying what you do not\nmean.\"\n",
                "A bright, irrepressible hope flamed up within her.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"I mean every word! Oh, if you could forget what I\nhave been, Andreas? If you would only have pity on me! Take me back; be\nmerciful! I have wanted to come back for more than a month now, come back\nto you and to the children; I have stood here behind the curtains and\nwatched you when you went out! The first time I really saw you was that\nnight on the yacht--do you remember? I had never seen you until then. You\nstood by the tiller. I saw you against the sky; your hair was a little\ngrey around the temples. I was so surprised when I saw you. I asked you if\nyou were cold. I did it so you would speak to me! I know--time passed, but\nduring all these weeks I have seen nobody but you--nobody! I am four and\ntwenty years old, and have never felt like this before. Everything you do,\neverything you say--And everything the little ones do and say. We play and\nlaugh, they cling to my neck.... I follow you with my eyes. See, I have\ncut a little hole in the curtain so that I can see you better. I can see\nyou all the way to the end of the street. I can tell your steps whenever\nyou walk down-stairs. Punish me, make me suffer, but do not cast me off!\nSimply to be here gives me a thousand joys, and I am altogether different\nnow--\"\n",
                "She could hardly stop; she continued to speak hysterically; at times her\nvoice was choked with emotion. She rose from the chair. She smiled while\nthe tears rained down her face. Her voice trailed off into inarticulate\nsounds.\n",
                "\"For Heaven's sake, be calm!\" he exclaimed abruptly, and his own tears\nwere falling as he spoke. His face twitched. He was furious because he\ncould not control himself better. He stood there and snapped out his\nwords. He could not find the ones he sought. \"You could always make me do\nwhatever you wanted. I am not very clever when it comes to bandying words,\nno, indeed! The clique knows how to talk, but I haven't learned the art--\nForgive me, I did not mean to hurt you. But if you mean that you want me\nto take somebody else's place now--If you want me as a successor--Of\ncourse, I do not know, but I ask. You say you want to come back now. But\n_how_ do you come back? Oh, I don't want to know; go in God's name!\"\n",
                "\"No, you are right. I simply wanted to ask you--I had to. I have been\nunfaithful to you, yes. I have done everything I shouldn't do,\neverything--\"\n",
                "\"Well, let us end this scene. You need rest more than anything else.\"\n",
                "Tidemand walked to the door. She followed him with wide-open eyes.\n",
                "\"Punish me!\" she cried. \"I ask you to--have pity! I should be grateful to\nyou. Don't leave me, I cannot bear to have you go! Do not cast me off; I\nhave been unfaithful and--But try me once more; try me only a little! Do\nyou think I might remain here? I don't know--\"\n",
                "He opened the door. She stood still, her eyes dilated. From them shone the\ngreat question.\n",
                "\"Why do you look at me like that? What do you want me to do?\" he asked.\n\"Come to your senses. Do not brood over the past. I will do all I can for\nthe children. I think that is all you can reasonably ask.\"\n",
                "Then she gave up. She stretched her arms out after him as the door closed.\nShe heard his steps down the stairs. He paused a moment as if uncertain\nwhich way to take. Hanka ran to the window, but she heard his office door\nopen. Then all was quiet.\n",
                "Too late! How could she have expected otherwise? Good God, how could she\nhave expected otherwise! How she had nourished that vain hope night and\nday for a whole month! He had gone; he said no, and he went away. Most\nlikely he even objected to her staying with the children!\n",
                "Mrs. Hanka moved the following day. She took a room she saw advertised in\nthe paper, the first room she came across; it was near the Fortress. She\nleft home in the morning while Tidemand was out. She kissed the children\nand wept. She put her keys in an envelope and wrote a line to her husband.\nTidemand found it upon his return; found the keys and this farewell, which\nwas only a line or two.\n",
                "Tidemand went out again. He sauntered through the streets, down toward the\nharbour. He followed the docks far out. A couple of hours went by, then he\nreturned the same way. He looked at his watch; it was one o'clock.\nSuddenly he ran across Coldevin.\n",
                "Coldevin stood immovable behind a corner and showed only his head. When he\nsaw Tidemand coming straight toward him he stepped out in the street and\nbowed.\n",
                "Tidemand looked up abstractedly.\n",
                "And Coldevin asked:\n",
                "\"Pardon me, isn't this Mr. Irgens I see down there--that gentleman in\ngrey?\"\n",
                "\"Where? Oh, yes, it looks like him,\" answered Tidemand indifferently.\n",
                "\"And the lady who is with him, isn't that Miss Lynum?\"\n",
                "\"Perhaps it is. Yes, I fancy that is she.\"\n",
                "\"But wasn't she going away to-day? It seems to me I heard--Perhaps she has\nchanged her mind?\"\n",
                "\"I suppose she has.\"\n",
                "Coldevin glanced swiftly at him. Tidemand looked as if he did not want to\nbe disturbed. He excused himself politely and walked off, lost in thought.\n"

He even said with a shy\nsmile that if she would not think him affected he would like to jot down a\ncouple of stanzas which just now occurred to him. And he jotted down the\ncouple of stanzas.\n",

                "\"Oh, simply because I am at a loss to understand how you can have such a\npoor opinion of our youth when you know its production. We have writers of\nrank--\"\n",
                "\"Yes--but, on the other hand, there is in your circle a young man who has\nlost heavily in rye,\" answered Coldevin. \"I am more interested in him. Do\nyou know what this man is doing? He is not crushed or broken by his loss.\nHe is just now creating a new article of export; he has undertaken to\nsupply a foreign enterprise with tar, Norwegian tar. But you do not\nmention his name.\"\n",
                "\"No; I must confess that my knowledge of Norwegian tar is limited, but--\"\n",
                "\"There may be nothing lacking in your knowledge, Mr. Attorney, but you\nhave possibly too little sympathy for commerce and the creation of values.\nOn the other hand, you are thoroughly up to date as far as the aesthetic\noccurrences are concerned; you have heard the latest prose poem. We have\nso many young writers; we have Ojen, and we have Irgens, and we have\nPaulsberg, and we have many more. That is the young Norway. I see them on\nthe streets occasionally. They stalk past me as poets should stalk past\nordinary people. They are brimful of new intentions, new fashions. They\nare fragrant with perfume--in brief, there is nothing lacking. When they\nshow up everybody else is mute: 'Silence! The poet speaks.' The papers are\nable to inform their readers that Paulsberg is on a trip to Honefos. In a\nword--\"\n",
                "But this was too much for Gregersen. He himself had written the news notes\nabout Paulsberg's trip to Honefos. He shouted:\n",
                "\"But you have the most infernal way of saying insolent things! You look as\nif you were saying nothing of consequence--\"\n",
                "\"I simply cannot understand why you lose your temper,\" said Milde\ntranquilly, \"when Paulsberg himself told us to grin and bear it!\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"In a word,\" resumed Coldevin, \"the people do their duty, the papers do\ntheir duty. Our authors are not ordinary, readable talents; no, they are\nflaming pillars of fire; they are being translated into German! They\nassume dimensions. This, of course, can be repeated so often that people\nat last believe it; but such a self-delusion is very harmful. It makes us\ncomplacent, it perpetuates our insignificance.\"\n",
                "Gregersen plays a trump card:\n",
                "\"But tell me, you--I don't remember your name:--do you know the story of\nVinje and the potato? I always think of that when I hear you speak. You\nare so immensely unsophisticated; you are from the country, and you think\nyou can amaze us. You have not the slightest suspicion that your opinions\nare somewhat antiquated. Your opinions are those of the self-taught man.\nOnce Vinje began to ponder over the ring in a newly cut, raw potato; being\nfrom the country, you, at least, must know that there in springtime,\noften, is a purple figure in a potato. And Vinje was so interested in this\npurple outline that he sat down and wrote a mathematical thesis about it.\nHe took this to Fearnley in the fond belief that he had made a great\ndiscovery. 'This is very fine,' said Fearnley; 'it is perfectly correct.\nYou have solved the problem. But the Egyptians knew this two thousand\nyears ago--' They knew it ages ago, ha, ha, ha! And I am always reminded\nof this story when I hear you speak! Don't be offended, now!\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"No, I am not offended in the least,\" said Coldevin. \"But if I understand\nyou correctly, then we agree. I am only saying what you already know?\"\n",
                "But Gregersen shook his head in despair and turned to Milde.\n",
                "\"He is impossible,\" he said. He emptied his glass and spoke again to\nColdevin, spoke in a louder voice than necessary; he bent toward him and\nshouted: \"For Heaven's sake, man, don't you understand that your opinions\nare too absurd--the opinions of the self-taught man? You think that what\nyou say is news to us. We have heard it for ages; we know it, and we think\nit ridiculous. Isch! I don't want to talk to you!\"\n",
                "And Gregersen got up and walked unsteadily away. It was six o'clock. The\nthree men who remained at the table sat silently a few moments. At last\nColdevin said:\n",
                "\"There goes Journalist Gregersen. That man has my unqualified pity and\nsympathy.\"\n",
                "\"He would hardly accept it,\" said Milde with a laugh.\n",
                "\"But he cannot avoid it. I think often of these writers for the daily\npress, these faithful workers who accomplish more in a month than the\npoets wring from themselves during a year. They are often married men in\npoor circumstances; their fate is not too pleasant at best. They have\nprobably dreamed about a freer and richer life than this slavery in an\noffice where their best efforts are swallowed up in anonymity, and where\nthey often have to repress themselves and their convictions in order to\nkeep their jobs. It might be well if these men were given the approbation\nthey deserved; it might even be profitable; it might bear fruit in a free\nand honest newspaper literature. What have we at present? An irresponsible\npress, lacking convictions and clearly defined principles, its policy\ndictated by personal preferences--by even worse motives. No; a truly great\njournalist ranks far higher than a poet.\"\n",
                "Just then the door opened and Irgens and Miss Aagot entered. They stopped\nby the door and looked around; Aagot showed no sign of embarrassment, but\nwhen she caught sight of Coldevin, she stepped forward quickly, with a\nsmile on lips that were already opened as if to speak. Suddenly she\nstopped. Coldevin stared at her and fumbled mechanically at his buttons.\n",
                "This lasted a few moments. Irgens and Aagot went over to the table, shook\nhands, and sat down. Aagot gave Coldevin her hand. Milde wanted to know\nwhat they would have. He happened to be flush. \"Order anything you like--\"\n",
                "\"You come too late,\" he said smilingly. \"Coldevin has entertained us\nsplendidly.\"\n",
                "Irgens looked up. He shot a swift glance at Coldevin and said, while he\nlit a cigar:\n",
                "\"I have enjoyed Mr. Coldevin's entertainment once before in Tivoli, I\nbelieve. This will have to satisfy me for the present.\"\n",
                "It was only with difficulty that Irgens succeeded in hiding his\ndispleasure. This was the second time to-day he had seen Coldevin; he had\nobserved him outside his lodgings in Thranes Road No. 5. He had not been\nable to get Aagot out until this infernal fellow had disappeared. By a\nhappy chance Grande had passed by; otherwise he would probably have been\nthere still. And how had he acted? He had stood like a guard, immovable;\nIrgens had been furious. He had had the greatest difficulty in keeping\nAagot from the windows. If she had happened to glance out she must have\ndiscovered him. He had made no effort to conceal himself. One would think\nhe had stood there with the avowed intention of being seen, in order to\nkeep the couple in a state of siege.\n",
                "Now he appeared slightly embarrassed. He fingered his glass nervously and\nlooked down. But suddenly it seemed as if Irgens's insolence had roused\nhim; he said bluntly and without connection with what had been discussed\nbefore:\n",
                "\"Tell me one thing--Or, let me rather say it myself: These poets are\nturning everything upside down; nobody dares to grumble. An author might\nowe in unsecured debts his twenty thousand--what of it? He is unable to\npay, that is all. What if a business man should act in this manner? What\nif he were to obtain wine or clothes on false promises of payment? He\nwould simply be arrested for fraud and declared bankrupt. But the authors,\nthe artists, these talented superbeings who suck the country's blood like\nvampires to the nation's acclaim--who would dare take such measures with\nthem? People simply discuss the scandal privately and laugh and think it\ninfernally smart that a man can owe his twenty thousand--\"\n",
                "Milde put his glass down hard and said:\n",
                "\"My good man, this has gone far enough!\"\n",
                "That splendid fellow Milde seemed all at once to have lost his patience.\nWhile he was sitting alone with the Attorney and the Actor he had found\nthe miserable Tutor's bitter sarcasms amusing, but no sooner had one of\nthe Authors appeared than he felt outraged and struck his fist on the\ntable. It was Milde's excellent habit always to await reinforcements.\n",
                "Coldevin looked at him.\n",
                "\"Do you think so?\" he said.\n",
                "\"I'll be damned if I don't.\"\n",
                "Coldevin had undoubtedly spoken intentionally. He had even addressed his\nremarks very plainly. Irgens bit his moustache occasionally.\n",
                "But now Norem woke up. He understood that something was happening before\nhis dull eyes, and he began to mix in, to declaim about business morals.\nIt was the rottenest morality on earth, usury--a morality for Jews! Was it\nright to demand usurious interest? Don't argue with him. He knew what he\nwas talking about. Ho! business morals! The rottenest morals on earth....\n",
                "Meanwhile the Attorney was talking across the table to Irgens and Miss\nAagot. He told them how he had come across Coldevin.\n",
                "\"I ran across him a moment ago up your way, Irgens, in Thranes Road, right\nbelow your windows. I brought him along. I couldn't let the fellow stand\nthere alone--\"\n",
                "Aagot asked quickly, with big, bewildered eyes:\n",
                "\"Thranes Road, did you say? Irgens, he was standing below your windows!\"\n",
                "Her heart was fluttering with fear. Coldevin observed her fixedly; he made\nsure that she should notice he was staring straight at her.\n",
                "Meanwhile Norem continued his impossible tirade. So it was charged that\nthe people as a whole was corrupt, that its men and women were debased\nbecause they honoured literature and art. \"Ho! you leave art alone, my\ngood man, and don't you bother about that! Men and women corrupt!--\"\n",
                "Coldevin seized this chance remark by the hair and replied. He did not\naddress Norem; he looked away from him. He spoke about something that\nevidently was vitally important in his eyes. He addressed himself to\nnobody in particular, and yet his words were meant for some one. It was\nhardly correct to say that men and women were corrupt; they had simply\nreached a certain degree of hollowness; they had degenerated and grown\nsmall. Shallow soil, anaemic soil, without growth, without fertility! The\nwomen carried on their surface existence. They were not tired of life, but\nthey did not venture much either. How could they put up any stakes? They\nhad none to put up. They darted around like blue, heatless flames; they\nnibbled at everything, joys and sorrows, and they did not realise that\nthey had grown insignificant. Their ambitions did not soar; their hearts\ndid not suffer greatly; they beat quite regularly, but they did not swell\nmore for one thing than for another, more for one person than for another.\nWhat had our young women done with their proud eyes? Nowadays they looked\non mediocrity as willingly as on superiority. They lost themselves in\nadmiration over rather every-day poetry, over common fiction. Some time\nago greater and prouder things were needed to conquer them. There was a\npage here and there in Norway's history to prove that. Our young women had\nmodified their demands considerably; they couldn't help it; their pride\nwas gone, their strength sapped. The young woman had lost her power, her\nglorious and priceless simplicity, her unbridled passion, her brand of\nbreed. She had lost her pride in the only man, her hero, her god. She had\nacquired a sweet tooth. She sniffed at everything and gave everybody the\nwilling glance. Love to her was simply the name for an extinct feeling;\nshe had read about it and at times she had been entertained by it, but it\nhad never sweetly overpowered her and forced her to her knees; it had\nsimply fluttered past her like an outworn sound. \"But the young woman of\nour day does not pretend to all this; alas, no! She is honestly shorn.\nThere is nothing to do about it; the only thing is to keep the loss within\nlimits. In a few generations we shall probably experience a renaissance;\neverything comes in cycles. But for the present we are sadly denuded. Only\nour business life beats with a healthy, strong pulse. Only our commerce\nlives its deed-filled life. Let us place our faith in that! From it will\nthe newer Norway spring!\"\n",
                "These last words seemed to irritate Milde; he took out of his pocketbook a\nten-crown bill which he threw across the table to Coldevin. He said\nfuriously:\n",
                "\"There--take your money! I had almost forgotten that I owed you this\nmoney, but I trust you understand that you can go now!\"\n",
                "Coldevin coloured deeply. He took the bill slowly.\n",
                "\"You do not thank me very politely for the loan,\" he said.\n",
                "\"And who has told you that I am a polite man? The main thing is that you\nhave got your money and that we hope now to be rid of you.\"\n",
                "\"Well, I thank you; I need it,\" said Coldevin. The very way in which he\npicked up the bill showed plainly that he was not used to handling money.\nSuddenly he looked straight at Milde and added:\n",
                "\"I must confess I had not expected you ever to repay this loan.\"\n",
                "Milde blazed up, but only for a moment. Even this direct insult did not\nmake him lose his temper. He swallowed it, mumbled a reply, said finally\nthat he had not intended to be rude; he would apologise....\n",
                "But Norem, who sat there drunk and dull, could no longer repress his\namusement. He only saw the comical side of the incident and cried\nlaughingly:\n",
                "\"Have you touched this fellow, too, Milde? So help me, you can borrow\nmoney from anybody! You are inimitable. Ha, ha! from him, too!\"\n",
                "Coldevin rose.\n",
                "Aagot got up simultaneously and ran over to him. She took his hand, a prey\nto the greatest excitement. She began whispering to him. She led him over\nto a window and continued speaking earnestly, in a low voice. They sat\ndown. There was nobody else around, and she said:\n",
                "\"Yes, yes, you are right; it is true. You were speaking to me; I\nunderstood it only too well; you are right, right, right! Oh, but it is\ngoing to be different! You said that I couldn't, that it was not within my\npower; but I can; I will show you! I understand it all now; you have\nopened my eyes. Dear, do not be angry with me. I have done a great wrong,\nbut--\"\n",
                "She wept with dry eyes. She swallowed hard. She sat on the very edge of\nthe chair in her excitement. He injected a word now and then, nodded,\nshook his head when she appeared too disconsolate, and in his confusion he\ncalled her \"Aagot, dearest Aagot.\" She must not apply everything he had\nsaid to herself, not at all. Of course, he had thought of her, too, that\nwas true; but then he had been mistaken--thank God for that! He had simply\nwanted to warn her. She was so young; he, who was older, knew better from\nwhere danger threatened. But now she must forget it and be cheerful.\n",
                "They continued to speak. Irgens grew impatient and rose. He stretched\nhimself and yawned as if to indicate that he was going. Suddenly he\nremembered something he had forgotten. He walked quickly over to the bar\nand got some roasted coffee which he put in his vest pocket.\n",
                "Milde settled the checks. He flung money around with the greatest\nunconcern; then he said good-bye and left. A moment afterward they saw him\nbow to a lady outside. He spoke a few words and they walked away through a\nside-street. The lady wore a long boa which billowed behind her in the\nbreeze.\n",
                "And still Aagot and Coldevin sat there.\n",
                "\"Won't you take me home? Excuse me a moment, I want to--\"\n",
                "She ran over to Irgens's table and took her coat from the chair.\n",
                "\"Are you going?\" he asked her in amazement.\n",
                "\"Yes. Ugh--I won't do this any more. Goodbye!\"\n",
                "\"What won't you do any more? Don't you want me to take you home?\"\n",
                "\"No. And not later either; not to-morrow. No, I am through for good.\" She\ngave Irgens her hand and said good-bye quickly. All the time she looked at\nColdevin and seemed impatient to be off.\n",
                "\"Remember our engagement for to-morrow,\" Irgens said.\n"

                "Aagot and Coldevin walked together down the street. He said nothing about\nhis going away, and she didn't know of his intention. She was happy to be\nwith Coldevin, this phenomenon who irritated everybody with his impossible\nharangues. She walked close beside him; her heart was fluttering.\n",
                "\"Forgive me!\" she pleaded. \"Yes, you must forgive me everything, both that\nwhich has happened before and to-day. A while ago I should have been\nafraid to ask you, but no sooner am I with you than I become bold again.\nYou never reprove me, never. But I haven't done anything wrong to-day--I\nmean to-day when I was far up-town; you understand what I mean.\" And she\nlooked at him with an open, straightforward glance.\n",

                "\"But, dearest Aagot,\" he exclaimed in his perplexity, \"it was not meant\nfor you--I didn't mean it at all! And besides, I was mistaken, greatly\nmistaken; thank God, _you_ are entirely different. But promise me one\nthing, Aagot; promise that you will be a little careful, do! It is none of\nmy business, of course; but you have fallen in with a crowd--believe me,\nthey are not your kind of people. Mrs. Tidemand has gained bitter\nexperience through them.\"\n",

Hurriedly he ate\neverything that was placed before him; apparently he had not eaten for a\nlong while. And when he was through he took out the ten-crown bill and\npaid his check from that.

She was so taken up with this news about Coldevin that she forgot\neverything else; perhaps she even felt a sense of relief at the thought\nthat henceforth she would be free from his espionage. When Irgens touched\nher arm lightly she walked mechanically ahead. They went straight to his\nrooms. When they stood by the entrance she suddenly recoiled. She said\n\"No!\" repeatedly while she looked at him with staring, bewildered eyes.\nBut he pleaded with her. Finally he took her arm and led her firmly\ninside.\n",

                "On the corner Coldevin stood and watched. When the couple disappeared he\nstepped forward and walked over to the entrance. He stood there awhile.

Then\nhe sat down on the steps, close by the wall, waiting.\n",
                "An hour passed by. A tower-clock boomed. His train was not due to leave\nfor another hour. Half an hour went by. He heard somebody on the stairs.\nIrgens came first. Coldevin did not stir; he sat motionless with his back\nto the door. Then Aagot appeared. Suddenly she cried out loudly. Coldevin\narose and walked away. He had not looked at her nor had he said a word; he\nhad simply shown himself--he had been on the spot. He swayed like a man in\na stupor. He turned the very first corner, the frozen smile still on his\nlips.\n",
                "Coldevin walked straight down to the railway station. He bought his ticket\nand was ready. The doors were thrown open. He walked out to the\ntrain-shed; a porter came after him with his trunk. His trunk? All right;\nhe had almost forgotten it. Put it in there, in this empty compartment! He\nentered after it had been stowed away; then he collapsed utterly. He sat\nin the corner; his gaunt, emaciated body shivered convulsively. In a few\nmoments he took from his pocketbook a tiny silken bow in the Norwegian\ncolours and began to tear it to pieces. He sat there quietly and plucked\nthe threads apart. When he had finished he stared at the shreds with a\nfixed, vacant stare. The engine gave a hoarse blast; the train started.\nColdevin opened the window slowly and emptied his hand. And the tiny bits\nof red and blue whirled away behind the train, fluttered and sank to the\ngravel, to be ground in the dust beneath every man's foot.\n"

                "The days passed by.\n",
                "Finally a telegram arrived from Ole, and Aagot woke from her trance. The\nwire had been sent to Torahus. It reached her after much delay. Ole was in\nLondon.\n",
                "Well, what was to be done? Ole was in London, but he was not here yet. She\ndid not remember clearly how he looked. Dark, with blue eyes; tall, with a\nstray wisp of hair which always fell across his forehead. Whenever she\nthought of him he seemed to belong to an age long past. How long, long it\nwas since he went away!\n",
                "The telegram stirred to life again her dormant feelings for the absent\none. She trembled with the old sense of possession. She whispered his name\nand blessed him for his goodness. She called him to her, blushing\nbreathlessly. No, nobody was like him! He did not wrong anybody. He walked\nhis straightforward way, guileless and upright. How he loved her! Little\nmistress, little mistress! His breast was so warm! She grew warm herself\nwhen she nestled close to him. How he could look up from a row of figures\nand smile!... Oh, she had not forgotten!...\n",
                "She packed her belongings resolutely and wanted to go home in spite of\neverything. The evening before she left she said good-bye to Irgens, a\nprotracted good-bye which rent her heart. She was his now, and Ole would\nprobably get over it. She made up her mind. She would go home and she\nwould cancel her engagement as soon as Ole returned. What would he say\nwhen he read her letter with the ring enclosed? She writhed at the thought\nthat she wouldn't be near him to comfort him. She had to strike him from\nafar! And thus it had to end!\n",
                "Irgens was full of tenderness and cheered her as much as he could. They\nshould not be separated for long. If nothing else turned up he would walk\nup to her on his feet! Besides, she could get back to town; she wasn't a\npauper exactly; she even owned a yacht, a real yacht--what more did she\nwant? And Aagot smiled at this jest and felt relieved.\n",
                "The door was locked; they were alone. Everything was quiet; they heard\ntheir hearts beat. And they said farewell to each other.\n",
                "Irgens would not take her to the train. It might give rise to too much\ngossip; the town was so small and he was, unfortunately, so well known.\nBut they would write, write every day; otherwise she would never be able\nto endure the separation....\n",
                "Tidemand was the only one who knew of Aagot's departure and who followed\nher to the train. He was paying his usual call to Henriksen's office\nduring the afternoon and was having his daily chat with the old man. As he\nleft he met Aagot outside: she was ready to go. Tidemand accompanied her\nand carried her valise; her trunk had been sent ahead.\n",
                "It had rained and the streets were muddy. Aagot said several times:\n",
                "\"What a disagreeable, mournful day!\"\n",
                "They hardly spoke. Aagot simply said:\n",
                "\"It was very kind of you to come with me; otherwise I should have been\naltogether alone.\" And Tidemand noticed that she tried to appear\nunconcerned. She smiled, but her eyes were moist.\n",
                "He, too, smiled and said comfortingly that he was glad she was going to\nleave all this mud and filth; now she was going to the country, to cleaner\nroads, to purer air. These few words were all they spoke. They stood in\nthe train-shed beneath the glass vault. It had begun to rain, and they\nheard the drops beating on the roof while the engine stood wheezing on the\ntrack. Aagot entered her compartment and gave Tidemand her hand. And in a\nsudden desire to be forgiven, to be judged charitably, she said to this\nstranger, whom she knew so slightly:\n",
                "\"Good-bye--And do not judge me too harshly!\" and she coloured deeply.\n",
                "\"But, child!\" he said amazed. He had no time to say more.\n",
                "She put her fair little face out of the window and nodded as the train\nmoved along. Her eyes were wet, and she struggled not to break down. She\nlooked at Tidemand as long as she could see him, then she waved a tiny\nhandkerchief.\n",
                "The strange girl! Her unaffected simplicity moved him. He did not stop\nwaving until the train was out of sight. Not judge her too harshly? He\ncertainly wouldn't! And if he ever had been tempted to, he would know\nbetter in the future. She had waved to him--almost a stranger! He would be\nsure and tell Ole--how that would please him!...\n",

                "When he had given his orders in the warehouse, he walked over to the\nrestaurant where he usually took his meals. It was late. He ate hurriedly\nand spoke to no one. He was engrossed in thought about a new enterprise he\nhad in mind. His tar was going to Spain. The rye held firm, with good\nprices; he sold steadily, his business began to stretch forth new arms.\nThere was that new tannery near Torahus. How would it do if one gave a\nlittle thought to a tar-manufacturing plant alongside? He really was going\nto speak to Ole about that. He had had it in mind several weeks. He had\neven consulted an engineer about it. There were the cuttings and the tops.\nIf the tannery took the bark, why shouldn't the tar plant take the wood?\n",
                "Tidemand walked home. It rained steadily.\n",
                "A few steps from his office entrance he stopped abruptly; then he sidled\nquietly into an area-way. He stared straight ahead. His wife was standing\nout there in the rain, outside his office. She was gazing, now at his\noffice windows, now up to the second story. There she stood. He could not\nbe mistaken, and his breath came in gasps. Once before he had seen her\nthere. She had circled around in the shadows beneath the street lamps,\njust as now. He had called her name in a low voice, and she had\nimmediately hurried around the street corner without looking back. This\nhappened a Sunday evening three weeks ago. And now she was here again.\n",
                "He wanted to step forward. He made a movement and his raincoat rustled.\nShe glanced around quickly and hurried away. He stood immovable where he\nwas until she had disappeared.\n"

But so far was he from suspecting\nthe true condition of affairs that on the very last afternoon in London he\nbought her a little present, a carriage for her fiord pony on Torahus.\n",
                "And on his desk he found Aagot's letter with her ring enclosed.\n",
                "Ole Henriksen read the letter almost without grasping its meaning. His\nhands commenced to tremble, and his eyes were staring. He went over and\nlocked the office door, and read the letter once more. It was brief and to\nthe point; it could not be misunderstood; she gave him back his \"freedom.\"\nAnd there was the ring, wrapped in tissue-paper. No, he could hardly be\nuncertain as to the meaning of that letter.\n",
                "And Ole Henriksen drifted back and forth in his office for several hours.\nHe placed the letter on his desk and walked with hands tightly clasped\nbehind him. He took the letter again and read it once more. He was \"free\"!\n",
                "He must not think that she did not love him, she had written. She thought\nof him as much as ever; yes, more even. She begged his forgiveness a\nhundred times every day. But what good was it if she thought of him ever\nso much? she continued. She was his no more, it had come to that. But she\nhad not surrendered at once, nor without a struggle; God knows that she\nhad loved him so dearly, and that she did not want to belong to anybody\nbut to him. However, it had gone entirely too far now; she would only ask\nhim to judge her kindly, though she did not deserve it, and not to grieve\nover her.\n",
                "The letter was dated twice. She had not noticed that. It was written in\nAagot's large, childish hand, and was touching in its simplicity; she had\nmade several corrections.\n",
                "Yes, he had understood it clearly; and, besides, there was the ring. After\nall, what did _he_ amount to? He was no prominent man, known all over\nthe country; he was no genius who could interest a girl greatly; he was\njust an ordinary toiler, a business man--that was all. He should have\nknown better than imagine he would be allowed to keep Aagot's heart for\nhimself. Just see how he had fooled himself! Of course, he attended to his\nbusiness and worked conscientiously early and late, but that could not\nmake people fond of him. There was nothing to say to that. Anyhow, he knew\nnow why his telegrams had remained unanswered. He ought to have understood\nit at once, but he hadn't.... She had gone entirely too far. She said\ngoodbye and loved somebody else. Nothing could be done about that. If she\nloved somebody else, then.... It was probably Irgens--he would get her\nafter all. Tidemand had been right. It was dangerous with these many\nboat-rides and walks; Tidemand had had experience. Well, it was too late\nto think of that now. However, one's love could not have been so very\nfirmly rooted if a walk or two had been enough to break it down....\n",
                "And suddenly the anger blazed up in the poor fellow. He walked more\nrapidly and his forehead flamed. She had gone entirely too far. That was\nhis reward for the love he had lavished on her! He had knelt before a\nhussy. He had let that miserable lover of hers cheat him openly for years!\nHe could prove it by the ledger--look here--now Aagot's fine friend had\nbeen hard up for ten, now for fifty crowns! And he, Ole Henriksen, had\neven been afraid that Aagot some day might chance to see the poet's\naccount in his books. He had finally put away the ledger, entirely out of\nregard for the great man's feelings. It was a most suitable partnership;\nthey were worthy of each other. The poet had something to write about now,\na splendid subject! Ha, he must not grieve too much over her; she could\nnot stand that; she might even lose sleep over it! Think of that! But who\nhad said that he would grieve? She was mistaken. He might have knelt\nbefore her, but he hadn't licked her boots; no, he would hardly be\ncompelled to take to his bed on account of this. She need not worry; she\nneed not weep scalding tears on his account. So she had jilted him; she\nreturned his ring. What of it? But why had she dragged the ring all the\nway up to Torahus? Why hadn't she simply left it on his desk and saved the\npostage? Good-bye; good riddance! Go to the devil with your silk-lined\ndeceiver, and never let me hear of you again!...\n",
                "He wrung his hands in anguish and paced back and forth with long, furious\nstrides. He would take it like a man. He would fling his own ring in her\nface and end the comedy quickly. He stopped at the desk and tore the ring\noff his finger, wrapped it up, and put it in an envelope. He wrote the\naddress in large, brutal letters; his hand trembled violently. Somebody\nknocked. He flung the letter into a drawer and closed it hastily.\n",
                "It was one of his clerks who came to remind him that it was late. Should\nhe close up?\n",
                "\"Yes, close up. But wait; I am through now; I am going, too. Bring me the\nkeys.\"\n",
                "Nobody should be able to say that he broke down because of a shabby trick\nlike this. He would show people that he could keep his composure. He might\ngo to the Grand and celebrate his return with a plain glass of beer! That\nwould be just the thing. He had no intention of avoiding people. He had a\nrevolver lying in a desk drawer; but had he wanted to use that, even for\nthe briefest moment? Had he _thought_ of it even? Not at all. It just\noccurred to him now that it might be getting rusty. No, thank God! one was\nnot exactly weary of life....\n",
                "Ole Henriksen went to the Grand.\n",
                "He sat down at a table and ordered his glass of beer. A moment later he\nfelt somebody slap him on the shoulder. He looked up; it was Milde.\n",
                "\"Good old boy!\" shouted Milde. \"Are you sitting here without saying a\nword? Welcome back! Come over to the window; you will find a couple of the\nfellows there.\"\n",
                "Ole went over to the window. There were Ojen, Norem, and Gregersen, all of\nthem with half-empty wine-glasses in front of them. Ojen jumped up and\nsaid pleasantly:\n",
                "\"Welcome home, old man! I am glad to see you again. I have missed you a\ngood deal. I am coming down to-morrow to see you. There is something I\nwant to see you about.\"\n",
                "Gregersen gave him a finger. Ole took it, sat down, and told the waiter to\nbring him his beer.\n",
                "\"What! are you drinking beer? No, beer will never do on this occasion; it\nmust be wine!\"\n",
                "\"Well, drink what you want to. I am drinking beer.\"\n",
                "Just then Irgens arrived, and Milde called to him: \"Ole is drinking beer,\nbut we are not going to do that. What do you say?\"\n",
                "Irgens did not show the least sign of embarrassment when he faced Ole; he\nbarely nodded and said indifferently: \"Welcome home!\" And Ole looked at\nhim and noticed that his cuffs were not entirely clean; as a matter of\nfact, his dress was not quite up to his usual standard.\n",
                "But Milde repeated his question: wasn't it a little too commonplace to\ndrink beer at a double celebration?\n",
                "\"A double celebration?\" asked Gregersen.\n",
                "\"Exactly--yes. In the first place, Ole has returned, and that is of the\ngreatest importance to us at present; I frankly admit that. But I have, in\nthe second place, just been dispossessed from my studio, and that has also\na certain solemn significance. What do you think? The landlady came and\nwanted money. 'Money?' I asked in amazement, and so on and so on. But the\noutcome was that I was put out, without notice--only a couple of hours'.\nHa, ha! I have never heard of such a notice. Of course, she had already\ngiven me her ultimatum a month ago; still--I had to leave a couple of\nfinished canvases. But I think this ought to be celebrated in wine, for\nOle does not care what we drink.\"\n",
                "\"Of course not; why should I care?\" asked Ole.\n",
                "And the gentlemen drank industriously. They grew well disposed and\ncheerful before they took their departure. Irgens was first to leave; then\nOjen followed. Ole remained until they had all gone, all except Norem, who\nsat there as usual and slumbered. He had listened to the talk.\nOccasionally he had injected a word. He had grown weary and subdued; a\nbitter disgust had taken possession of him and made him dully indifferent\nto everything.\n",
                "At last he got up and paid his check.\n",
                "The waiter halted him.\n",
                "\"Pardon me,\" he said, \"but the wine--\"\n",
                "\"The wine?\" asked Ole. \"I have only had a couple of glasses of beer.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, but the wine isn't paid for.\"\n",
                "So the gentlemen hadn't paid their checks? For a moment the hot anger\nblazed up in him again; he was on the point of saying that if they would\nsend the bill to Torahus it would be paid instantly. But he said: \"All\nright; I can pay it, I suppose.\"\n",
                "But what should he do at home? Go to bed and sleep? If he only could! He\nturned into the darkest streets in order to be alone. He was going\nhomeward, but he swung aside and walked toward the Fortress.\n",
                "Here he suddenly came across Tidemand. He was standing in front of a dark\ngateway gazing at the house opposite. What could Tidemand be doing there?\n",
                "Ole walked over to him. They looked at each other in surprise.\n",
                "\"I am taking a walk, a little walk,\" said Tidemand somewhat sheepishly. \"I\ncame by here by accident--Thank goodness, you are back, Ole! Welcome home!\nLet us get away from here!\"\n",
                "Tidemand could not get over his surprise. He had not known that Ole was\nback. Everything was all right at the office; he had called on the old man\nregularly, as he had promised.\n",
                "\"And your sweetheart has gone away,\" he continued. \"I went with her to the\ntrain. She is a darling girl! She was a little upset because she was going\naway; she stood there and looked at me with real shining eyes; you know\nhow she is. And as the train went off she took out her handkerchief and\nwaved to me--waved so sweetly, just because I had come with her. You ought\nto have seen her; she was lovely.\"\n",
                "\"Well, I am not engaged any more,\" said Ole in a hollow voice.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Ole went into his office. It was late at night. He had walked with\nTidemand a long time and told him everything. He was going to write a\nletter to Aagot's parents, respectful and dignified, without reproaches.\nHe felt he ought to do that.\n",
                "When he had finished this letter he read Aagot's once more. He wanted to\ntear it to pieces and burn it up, but he paused and placed it in front of\nhim on the desk. It was at least a letter from her, the last. She had sat\nthere and written to him and thought of him while she wrote. She had held\nthe paper with her tiny hands, and there her pen had scratched. She had\nprobably wiped it on something and dipped it and written on. That letter\nwas for him, for no one else. Everybody had probably been in bed while she\nwrote.\n",
                "He took the ring out of its wrapping and looked at it for a long time. He\nwas sorry that he had lost his temper and said words which he now\nregretted. He took them back, every one. Good-bye, then, Aagot....\n",

Why did she wear such old dresses? But he had\nsent her a good deal of money. Thank God, he was able to do that. In the\nbeginning, when he was still struggling, he hadn't sent her such large\namounts, it was true. He had grieved over it and written to her not to be\nimpatient; it would be better soon.

                "\"Never mind about the rest,\" she said to the clerk in a low voice. \"I'll\nget that some other time.\" And she paid hurriedly and gathered up her\nbundles. Tidemand followed her with his eyes. She stooped as she walked\nand looked abashed until she disappeared.\n"

He had taken\nother apartments in the residential district--elegant apartments, fine\nview, furniture upholstered in leather! He simply couldn't have stood it\nmuch longer in the old lodgings; his best moods were constantly being\nspoiled; he suffered. It was necessary to pay a little attention to one's\nsurroundings if one cared to produce good work. Miss Lynum had come to\ntown a week ago and was going to remain awhile; she made him feel like a\nnew man. How the whole town burst into bloom and colour when Aagot\nreturned!\n",
                "It had all been decided: they were going to get married next spring and\npin their faith to next year's subsidy. It would seem that he must be\nrecognised sometime, especially now when he was going to found a family\nand was publishing a new collection of poems. They couldn't starve him to\ndeath entirely; hardly that! And Irgens had approached Attorney Grande,\nwho had approached the Minister personally in regard to next year's\nsubsidy. \"You know my circumstances,\" he had said to Grande. \"I am not\nwell off, but if you will speak to the Minister I shall be much obliged to\nyou. Personally, I will do nothing. I cannot stoop to that!\" Grande was a\nman whom Irgens otherwise honoured with his contempt. But it could not be\nhelped; this brainless Attorney began to have influence; he had been\nappointed on a royal commission and had even been interviewed by the\n_Gazette_.\n",
                "When Tidemand told Ole that he had seen Aagot on the street it gave him a\nfearful shock. But he recovered himself quickly and said with a smile:\n",
                "\"Well, how does that concern me? Let her be here as much as she likes; I\nhave no objections. I have other things to worry about.\" He forced himself\nto renewed interest in the conversation, talked about Tidemand's new\norders for tar, and said repeatedly: \"Be sure to have the cargo well\ninsured; it never hurts!\" He was a little nervous but otherwise normal.\n",
                "They drank a glass of wine as of old. A couple of hours went by while they\nchatted cosily, and when Tidemand left Ole said, full of gratitude:\n",
                "\"I am awfully glad that you came to see me. I know you have enough to do\nbesides this--Listen,\" he continued; \"let us go to the farewell\nperformance of the opera this evening; I want you to come!\" And the\nserious young man with the hollow eyes looked as if he were exceedingly\nanxious to attend that performance. He even said he had looked forward to\nit for several days.\n",
                "Tidemand promised to come; Ole said that he would get the tickets.\n",
                "No sooner had Tidemand left the office than Ole telephoned for the tickets\nhe wanted--three tickets together, 11, 12, and 13. He was going to take\nNo. 12 to Mrs. Hanka, to her room near the Fortress. She would surely want\nto come, for nobody could be fonder of the opera than she used to be. He\nrubbed his hands in satisfaction as he walked along--No. 12; she should\nsit between them. He would keep No. 13 for himself; that was a proper\nnumber for him, a most unlucky number.\n",
                "He walked faster and faster and forgot his own misery. He was done and\nthrough with it all; his sufferings lay behind; he had recovered fully.\nHad he been so very much shaken because Aagot had come to town? Not at\nall; it had not affected him in the least.\n",
                "And Ole walked on. He knew Mrs. Hanka's address well; more than once had\nhe taken her home when she had called on him secretly, asking for news\nabout the children. And had he not found Tidemand outside her windows that\nnight he returned from England? How their thoughts were ever busy with\neach other! With him it was different; he had forgotten his experience and\ndid not think of such things any more.\n",
                "But when he inquired for Mrs. Hanka he was told that she had gone away for\na couple of days; she had gone to the country house. She would be back\nto-morrow.\n",
                "He listened and did not understand at once. The country house? Which\ncountry house?\n",
                "Of course, yes; Tidemand's country house. Ole glanced at his watch. No; it\nwas too late to try and get Mrs. Hanka back to-day. What reason could he\nhave given, anyway? He had wanted to surprise them both with his little\nscheme, but now it had become impossible. Alas, how everything turned out\nbadly for him of late!\n",
                "Ole turned back.\n",
                "To the country house! How she haunted the old places! She had been unable\nto resist; she had to see once more that house and these grounds, although\nthe leaves were almost gone and the garden was desolate. Oh! Aagot had\nintended to spend the summer there if everything had turned out all right.\nWell, that was another matter, something that did not concern him in the\nleast.\n",
                "Ole was weary and disappointed. He decided to go to Tidemand at once and\ntell him everything. He had meant it for the best.\n",
                "\"We shall have to go alone after all,\" he said. \"I really have a ticket\nfor your wife, though.\"\n",
                "Tidemand changed colour.\n",
                "\"You have?\" he simply said.\n",
                "\"Yes, I had planned to have her sit between us; perhaps I ought to have\ntold you beforehand; but any way, she has gone away and won't be back till\nto-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"Is that so?\" said Tidemand as before.\n",
                "\"Listen, you mustn't be angry with me because of this! If you only knew--\nYour wife has called on me quite frequently of late; she asks about you\nand the children--\"\n",
                "\"That is all right.\"\n",
                "\"What?\"\n",
                "\"I say, that is all right. But why do you tell me this?\"\n",
                "Then Ole's anger blazed forth; he stuck his face close up to Tidemand's\nand shouted furiously, in a shrill voice:\n",
                "\"I want to tell you something, damn you--you don't understand your own\nwelfare! You are a fool, you are killing her--that will be the end of it.\nAnd you are doing your very best to go the same way yourself--don't you\nthink I see it? 'That is all right'--so it is all right for her to steal\ndown to me when darkness falls and ask about you and the children with the\ntears dripping from her eyes? Do you for a moment imagine it is for\n_your_ sake I have been inquiring about your health these last\nmonths? Why should I ask if not for her? You personally can go to the\ndevil as far as I am concerned. You say nothing; you cannot understand\nthat she is wearing her heart away for you. I saw her outside your office\nonce at midnight, saying good night to you and to the children. She wept\nand blew kisses to Johanna and Ida; she tiptoed up-stairs and caressed the\ndoor-knob because your hand had held it a moment before. I have seen this\nseveral times from the corner. I suppose you will say that 'that is all\nright,' too; for your heart must be petrified--Well, perhaps I shouldn't\nsay that your heart is exactly petrified,\" added Ole repentantly when at\nlast he noticed Tidemand's terrible face. \"But you need not expect any\napology from me, either. You are hardened; that's what you are! I tell\nyou, Hanka wants to come back!\"\n",
                "Pause.\n",
                "\"I wish to God she wanted to come back--I mean--Back, you say? But how?\nDo you know what has happened? I do. I have wanted to go to Hanka and beg\nher to come back--beg her on my knees, if necessary; but how would she\ncome back--how would she come back? She told me herself--Of course, it is\nnothing much; you mustn't think it is anything bad, anything very bad;\ndon't think that of Hanka. But, anyway, I am not so sure that she wants to\ncome back. From where have you got that idea?\"\n",
                "\"Well, perhaps I ought not to have tried to interfere,\" said Ole. \"But\nthink of it anyway, Andreas; and pardon my violence; I take it all back. I\ndon't know how it is; I am getting to be so hot-tempered lately. But think\nit over. And let us be ready in an hour or so.\"\n",
                "\"So she still asks for the children,\" said Tidemand. \"Think of that!\"\n"

                "Ole Henriksen stood in his office a few days later. It was in the\nafternoon, about three; the weather was clear and calm; the docks were\nbusy as ever.\n",
                "Ole walked over to the window and looked out. An enormous coal-steamer was\ngliding in from the fiord; masts and rigging pointed skyward everywhere;\ncargoes were being unloaded along the wharves. Suddenly he started; the\nyacht was gone! He opened his eyes wide. Among all the hundreds of\nmastheads none were golden.\n",
                "He wanted to go out and look into this, but paused at the door. He went\nback to his desk again, leaned his head on his hands, and reflected. In\nreality the yacht did not belong to him any more; it was hers, Miss\nLynum's; he had given it to her, and the papers were in her keeping. She\nhad not returned these papers together with the ring; she might have\nforgotten it--how could he know? Anyway, the yacht was hers; he had\nnothing to do with it. But if it had been stolen? Well, even that was no\naffair of his.\n",
                "Ole took up his pen again, but only for a few moments. Dear me, she used\nto sit there on the sofa and sew so busily on the little cushions! They\nhad been so cute and tiny that it was almost absurd. There she used to\nsit; he could see her still....\n",
                "And Ole wrote again.\n",
                "Then he opened the door and called out to the clerks that the yacht had\ndisappeared; what had happened?\n",
                "One of the clerks informed him that the yacht had been removed this\nmorning by two men from a lawyer's office; she was anchored outside the\nFortress now.\n",
                "\"Which lawyer?\" asked Ole.\n",
                "The clerk didn't know.\n",
                "Ole grew curious. The yacht was not his any more, of course; but Miss\nLynum had no business with a lawyer either; there must be a\nmisunderstanding somewhere. And straightway he went down to the Fortress\nlanding and made inquiries for a couple of hours. Finally he learned the\nname of the lawyer and went to his office.\n",
                "He saw a man of his own age and asked a few guarded questions.\n",
                "Yes, it was quite true; he had orders to sell the yacht; as a matter of\nfact, he had already advanced a thousand crowns on it. Here were the\npapers; Irgens had left them with him, the poet Irgens. He hoped there\nwere no objections?\n",
                "None at all.\n",
                "The lawyer grew more and more polite and cordial; he probably knew\neverything about the whole matter, but he did not betray his knowledge.\nHow much was the yacht worth, did Mr. Henriksen think? Irgens had come to\nhim with a request that he take charge of this transaction; he had said\nthat he needed some money at once, and of course one had to stretch a\npoint where a man like Irgens was concerned. Unfortunately, our men of\ntalent were not rewarded any too liberally, as a rule; but if there was\nthe least objection to this sale he would try his best to arrange\neverything satisfactorily.\n",
                "And Ole said again that there was none; he had simply missed the yacht and\nwondered what had become of it. And he left.\n",
                "Now it had become clear why Irgens suddenly had blossomed forth in gay\nplumage, rejuvenated from top to toe! The whole town was talking about it;\nhowever, nobody knew the real source of his affluence. That _she_\nshould do such a thing! Didn't she understand that this was dishonourable,\ndisgraceful? On the other hand, why was it so disgraceful? Her possessions\nwere his; they shared lovingly; there was nothing to say to that. In God's\nname, let her act as she thought right and proper. She was in town now;\nshe was going to take a course in the School of Industries. It was quite\nnatural that she should realise on that bit of a yacht. Could anybody\nblame her because she helped her fianc\u00e9? On the contrary, it reflected\ncredit on her.... But she might not even know that the yacht had been put\non the market. Perhaps she had forgotten both yacht and documents and did\nnot care what became of them. At any rate, she had not wanted to sell the\nyacht simply to raise money on her own account--never; he knew her too\nwell. She had done it for somebody else's sake; that was she. And that was\nthe important point.\n",
                "He remembered her so distinctly: her fair curls, her nose, her dimple; she\nwould be nineteen on the seventh of December. Never mind the yacht; that\ndidn't matter. He might have wished to save the cushions, but it would\nprobably be too late for that.\n",
                "He returned to his office, but could only concentrate his attention on\nwhat was absolutely necessary. He paused frequently and gazed straight\nahead, lost in reflection. What if he should buy back the yacht? Would she\nmind, perhaps? God knows; she might think it was done spitefully, with\nmalice aforethought. It might be better to remain neutral. Yes, that would\nbe best; what was the use of making a fool of himself?--Miss Lynum and he\nwere through with each other for ever. Nobody should say that he collected\nsouvenirs of her.\n",
                "He closed the office as usual and went out. The street lamps were burning\nbrightly; the evening was calm. He saw a light in Tidemand's office and\nstarted to go in; but he paused on the stairs and reflected. Tidemand\nmight be busy; he had better go on.\n",
                "Hour after hour passed by; he wandered around as in a stupor. How tired\nand weary he was! His eyes were half-closed. He found himself in the\nvicinity of the park. He turned and strode toward the hills behind the\ncity. He sat down on a stoop to rest. By and by he looked at his watch; it\nwas half past eleven. And he sauntered down toward the city again. His\nmind was almost a blank.\n",
                "He turned aside and passed by Tivoli and Sara. What a walk this had been!\nTo-night he was going to sleep--at last! Outside Sara he stopped abruptly.\nHe drew back in the shadows slowly, four, six steps; his eyes were staring\nfixedly toward the entrance to the cafe. A cab was standing outside.\n",
                "He had heard Aagot's voice; she came out with Irgens. Irgens appeared\nfirst. Aagot had been delayed by something on the stairs.\n",
                "\"Hurry up, now!\" called Irgens.\n",
                "\"Just a moment, Mr. Irgens,\" said the driver; \"the lady is not quite\nready.\"\n",
                "\"Do you know me?\" asked Irgens in surprise.\n",
                "\"I certainly do,\" said the cabman.\n",
                "\"He knows you! he knows you!\" cried Aagot as she stumbled down the steps.\nShe had not put on her wrap yet; it was dragging after her and she tripped\nin it. Her eyes were expressionless and staring. Suddenly she laughed.\n\"That nasty fellow, Gregersen; he was kicking me on the leg all the time!\nI am sure I am black and blue! Imagine, Irgens, the cabby knows you!\"\n",
                "\"You are drunk,\" said Irgens brutally, and helped her into the carriage.\n",
                "Her hat was awry, she tried to get into her coat and she babbled\nincoherently.\n",
                "\"No, I am not drunk; I am only a little cheerful--Won't you see if my leg\nis bruised? I am sure I am dripping blood! It hurts, too; but that doesn't\nmatter; nothing matters now. Drunk, you say? What if I am? It is your\nfault. I do everything for your sake--do it gladly--Ha, ha, ha! I have to\nlaugh when I think of that wretched Gregersen. He told me he would write\nthe most beautiful article about me if I would only let him see where he\nhad kicked me. It is different if you see it--That was an awful strong\nwine; it makes my head swim--And all those cigarettes!\"\n",
                "\"Drive on, damn you!\" cried Irgens.\n",
                "And the carriage rolled off.\n",
                "Ole stood there and stared after the carriage; his knees shook under him.\nHe fumbled convulsively with his hands up and down his clothes, around his\nchest. So that was Aagot! How they had corrupted her! how they had spoiled\nher! Aagot--his Aagot....\n",
                "Ole sat down on a stoop. A long time passed by.\n",
                "The lamps outside Sara were extinguished; it grew very dark. An officer\ntapped him on the shoulder and said that he could not sit there and sleep.\nOle looked up bewildered. Of course not; he was going now. Thanks! And he\nswayed down the street as if he were intoxicated.\n",
                "He reached home about two o'clock and entered his office. He lit the lamp\nand hung his hat mechanically on the rack; his face was drawn and void of\nexpression. A long hour went by while he strode up and down. Then he\nwalked over to his desk and commenced to write--letters, documents, brief\nlines on various papers which he sealed and filed away. He looked at his\nwatch; it was half past three. He wound it up mechanically while he held\nit. He went out and mailed a letter to Tidemand which he had just written.\nUpon his return he took Aagot's letters from the safe and loosened the\nstring that bound them together.\n",
                "He did not read any of these letters; he carried them over to the\nfireplace and burned them one by one. The last, the very last one, he\npulled halfway-out of its envelope and looked at it a moment; then he\nburned also that, without taking out the ring.\n",
                "The little clock on the wall struck four. A steamer's whistle sounded. Ole\nwent away from the fireplace. His face was full of anguish; every feature\nwas distorted; the veins around his temples were swollen. And slowly he\npulled out a little drawer in his desk.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "They found Ole Henriksen dead in the morning; he had shot himself. The\nlamp was burning on the desk; a few sealed letters were lying on the\nblotter; he himself lay stretched on the floor.\n",
                "In the letter to Tidemand he had asked to be forgiven because he could not\ncome for the last time and thank him for his friendship. He had to finish\nit all now; he could not live another day; he was sick unto death. The\ncountry house he gave to Tidemand in memory of everything. \"It will\nprobably bring you more pleasure than it brought me,\" he wrote; \"it is\nyours, my friend; accept it from me. Mrs. Hanka will be glad to have it;\nremember me to her. And if you ever should find Miss Lynum in need of\nhelp, be good to her; I saw her this evening, but she did not see me. I\ncannot collect my thoughts and write to you as I would like to. One thing\nonly is clear to me, and that thing I will have to do in half an hour.\"\n",
                "A picture of Aagot was still in his pocketbook; he had probably forgotten\nto burn it. He had also forgotten to send the two or three telegrams he\nhad carried in his pocket since the previous afternoon; they were found on\nhim. He had spoken truly: to him only one thing was clear!\n"

                "Part of September had passed; the weather was cool, the sky clear and\nhigh; the city was free from dust and dirt; the city was beautiful. As yet\nno snow had fallen on the mountains.\n",
                "Event had followed event; Ole Henriksen's suicide had only caused a\npassing sensation. The shot down there in the young business man's office\nhad not been followed by a very loud or reverberating echo; days and weeks\nhad come and gone, and nobody mentioned it any more. Only Tidemand could\nnot forget.\n",
                "Tidemand was busier than ever. He had to assist Ole's father for a while;\nthe old man did not want to retire, but he made the chief assistant his\npartner and carried on the business as before; he did not allow his sorrow\nto break him down.

                "He had finished the preparations, made out the papers, taken out his\ninsurance; it was all done. Before he turned to something else he lit a\ncigar and reflected.

He had never objected to her coming,\nand she knew it; still, she did not come. She had probably forgotten both\nhim and the children; it looked that way. And, although he had strolled\naround the streets near the Fortress many a night when it was too lonely\nat home and at times seen a light in her window, her he had never seen.\nWhat could she be doing?

Her hands trembled so\nviolently that she disarranged the bills, she even dropped a few; she\nstooped down and picked them up and stammered: \"Take it, please; don't say\nno! It is money which I have used for--which I have put to unworthy uses.\nSpare me from saying what I have used it for; it is too degrading. There\nought to be much more, but I couldn't delay any longer; there ought to be\ntwice as much, but I was too impatient to wait until I could bring it all.\nTake it, please!

                "\"But this money is altogether a different matter,\" she said timidly. \"It\nis for my own sake I give it to you. If I hadn't been able to think that I\nmight repay it I never could have endured life. I have counted and counted\nevery day and waited until I should have enough. I was wrong in saying\nthat it was only half; it is at least three-fourths--Oh, how I have\nsuffered under the disgrace--\"\n",
                "And suddenly he understood why she had wanted to bring him this money. He\ntook it and thanked her. He did not know what to say except that it was a\nlot of money, quite a lot. But could she spare it? Surely? For he really\nwould be glad if she would let him have it for the present; he could use\nit in the business. As a matter of fact, it was most fortunate that she\nhad come just now; he needed some money, he was not ashamed to confess\nit....\n",
                "He watched her closely and saw the joy well up in her; her eyes sparkled\nbeneath her veil, and she said:\n",

                "He saw how deeply she was moved, although she said nothing more. She gave\nhim her hand in farewell. \"I hope they will know me,\" she said.\n",
                "\"I'll be up in a moment,\" he remarked. \"I haven't much to do just now.\nPerhaps you would like to stay awhile? Here is the key; you need not ring.\nBut be careful of their shoes if you take them on your lap. Well, don't\nlaugh; God knows if their shoes aren't muddy!\"\n",
                "Hanka went. He opened the door for her and followed her to the foot of the\nstairs; then he returned to his office.\n",
                "He walked over to the desk, but he did not work. There she had stood! She\nwore her black velvet dress to-day; she was up-stairs. Could he go up now?\nHe did not hear the children; they were probably in her lap. He hoped they\nhad on their red dresses.\n",
                "He walked up-stairs, a prey to the strangest emotions. He knocked on the\ndoor as if it were somebody else's home he was entering. Hanka got up at\nonce when she saw him.\n",
                "She had taken off her veil; she flushed deeply. He could see now why she\nused a veil. The joyless days in her solitary room had not left her\nunmarked; her face spoke plainly of her sufferings. Johanna and Ida stood\nbeside her and clung to her dress; they did not remember her clearly; they\nlooked at her questioningly and were silent.\n",
                "\"They don't know me,\" said Mrs. Hanka, and sat down again. \"I have asked\nthem.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I know you,\" said Johanna, and crawled up into her lap. Ida did the\nsame.\n",
                "Tidemand looked at them unsteadily.\n",
                "\"You mustn't crawl all over mamma, children,\" he said. \"Don't bother mamma\nnow.\"\n",
                "They didn't hear him; they wanted to bother mamma. She had rings on her\nfingers and she had the strangest buttons on her dress; that was something\nto interest them! They began to chatter about these buttons; they caught\nsight of the mother's brooch and had many remarks to make about that.\n",
                "\"Put them down when you are tired of them,\" said Tidemand.\n",
                "Tired? She? Let them be, let them be!\n",
                "They spoke about Ole; they mentioned Aagot. Tidemand wanted to look her up\nsome day. Ole had asked him to do it; he felt, in a way, responsible for\nher. But the nurse came and wanted to put the children to bed.\n",
                "However, the children had no idea of going to bed; they refused\npointblank. And Hanka had to come along, follow them into their bed-room,\nand get them settled for the night. She looked around. Everything was as\nit used to be. There were the two little beds, the coverlets, the tiny\npillows, the picture-books, the toys. And when they were in bed she had to\nsing to them; they simply wouldn't keep still but crawled out of bed\ncontinually and chattered on.\n",
                "Tidemand watched this awhile with blinking eyes; then he turned quickly\naway and went out.\n",
                "In half an hour or so Hanka came back.\n",
                "\"They are asleep now,\" she said.\n",
                "\"I was wondering if I might ask you to stay,\" said Tidemand. \"We live\nrather informally here; we keep house in a way, but nothing seems to go\nright for us. If you would like to have dinner with us--I don't know what\nthey are going to give us to eat, but if you will take things as they\nare?\"\n",
                "She looked at him shyly, like a young girl; she said: \"Thank you.\"\n",
                "After dinner, when they had returned to the drawing-room, Hanka said\nsuddenly:\n",
                "\"Andreas, you mustn't think I came here to-day thinking that everything\ncould be well again with us. Don't think that. I simply came because I\ncouldn't wait any longer; I had to see you again.\"\n",
                "\"I have not thought of that at all,\" he said. \"But it seems the children\ndon't want to let you go.\"\n",
                "\"I have no thought of asking you again what I asked you for once,\" she\nsaid. \"That would be impossible; I know it too well. But perhaps you would\nallow me to come and visit you at times?\"\n",
                "Tidemand bowed his head. She had no thought of coming back; it was all\nover.\n",
                "\"Come whenever you like; come every day,\" he said. \"You are not coming to\nsee me.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, yes, to see you also. I think of you with every breath. Ever since\nthat sail last summer; it began then. You have changed and so have I. But\nthat is neither here nor there. I have seen you on the streets oftener\nthan you know; I have followed you at times.\"\n",
                "He rose and went in his confusion over to the barometer on the wall; he\nexamined it carefully and tapped the tube.\n",
                "\"But in that case--I don't understand why it is necessary to live apart. I\nmean--Things are in a sad state of disorder here; and then there are the\nchildren--\"\n",
                "\"I didn't come for that!\" she exclaimed. \"Yes, I did, in a way; of course\nI did; but--I am afraid you will never be able to forget--Oh, no. I cannot\nexpect that--\"\n",
                "She took her wraps.\n",
                "\"Don't go!\" he called. \"You have never been out of my thoughts, either. As\nfar as that goes, I am as much to blame as you, and it is true that I have\nchanged. I am, perhaps, a little different now. But here is your room just\nas before. Come and see! We haven't touched a single thing. And if you\nwould stay--By the way, I am afraid I shall have to stay in the office\nall night. I am almost sure there is a lot of mail to attend to. But your\nroom is just as when you left it. Come and see!\"\n",
                "He had opened the door. She came over and peeped in. The lamp was lit. She\nlooked at everything and entered. He really wanted to, after all, after\nall! She could stay; he had said so; he took her back! She stood there\ntimidly and said nothing; then their eyes met. He flung his arms around\nher and kissed her, as he had kissed her the first time, all these many\nyears ago. Her eyes closed and he felt suddenly the pressure of her arms\naround his neck.\n"

                "And morning came.\n",
                "The city woke up and the hammers danced their ringing dance along the\nshipyards. Through the streets the farmers' wagons rolled in a slow\nprocession. It is the same story. The squares are filling with people and\nsupplies, stores are opened, the roar increases, and up and down the\nstairs skips a slip of a girl with her papers and her dog.\n",
                "It is the same story.\n",
                "It is twelve before people begin to group themselves on the \"corner,\"\nyoung and carefree gentlemen who can afford to sleep late and do what they\nfeel like. There are a few from the well-known clique, Milde and Norem and\nOjen. It is cold, and they are shivering. The conversation is not very\nlively. Even when Irgens appears, in high spirits and elegant attire, as\nbefits the best-dressed man in town, nobody grows very enthusiastic. It is\ntoo early and too chilly; in a few hours it will be different. Ojen had\nsaid something about his latest prose poem; he had half-finished it last\nnight. It was called \"A Sleeping City.\" He had begun to write on coloured\npaper; he had found this very soothing. Imagine, he says, the heavy,\nponderous quiet over a city asleep; only its breathing is heard like an\nopen sluice miles away. It takes time; hours elapse, a seeming eternity;\nthen the brute begins to stir, to wake up. Wasn't this rather promising?\n",
                "And Milde thinks it very promising; he has made his peace with Ojen long\nago. Milde is busy on his caricatures to \"Norway's Dawn.\" He had really\ndrawn a few very funny caricatures and made ruinous fun of the impossible\npoem.\n",
                "Norem said nothing.\n",
                "Suddenly Lars Paulsberg bobs up; with him is Gregersen. The group is\ngrowing; everybody takes notice; so much is gathered here in a very small\nspace. Literature is in the ascendant; literature dominates the entire\nsidewalk. People turn back in order to get a good look at these six\ngentlemen in ulsters and great-coats. Milde also attracts attention; he\nhas been able to afford an entirely new outfit. He says nothing about\nAustralia now.\n",
                "At two the life and traffic has risen to its high-water mark; movement\neverywhere, people promenade, drive in carriages, gossip; engines are\nbreathing stertorously in the far distance. A steamer whistles in the\nharbour, another steamer answers with a hoarse blast; flags flutter,\nbarges swim back and forth; sails rattle aloft and sails are furled. Here\nand there an anchor splashes; the anchor-chains tear out of the\nhawse-holes in a cloud of rust. The sounds mingle in a ponderous harmony\nwhich rolls in over the city like a jubilant chorus.\n",
                "Tidemand's tar steamer was ready to weigh anchor. He had come down himself\nto see it off. Hanka was with him; they stood there quietly arm in arm.\nThey glanced at each other every few moments with eyes that were filled\nwith youth and happiness; the harbour saluted them with a swirl of flags.\nWhen the steamer at last was under way, Tidemand swung his hat in the air\nand Hanka waved with her handkerchief. Somebody on the ship waved back a\ngreeting. The steamer slid quietly out into the fiord.\n",
                "\"Shall we go?\" he asked.\n",
                "And she clung to him closer, and said: \"As you will.\"\n",
                "Just then another steamer entered the harbour, an enormous leviathan from\nwhose funnels smoke poured in billowy masses. Tidemand had goods aboard;\nhe had been waiting for this steamer the last two days, and he said in\ngreat good humour:\n",
                "\"She is also bringing us goods!\"\n",
                "\"Yes?\" she answered quietly. But he felt, as she looked into his face,\nthat a quivering joy shot through her being; her arm trembled in his.\n",
