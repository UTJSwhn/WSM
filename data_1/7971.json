                "Darkly you sweep on, Eternal Fugitive, round whose bodiless rush stagnant\nspace frets into eddying bubbles of light.\n",
                "Is your heart lost to the Lover calling you across his immeasurable\nloneliness?\n",
                "Is the aching urgency of your haste the sole reason why your tangled\ntresses break into stormy riot and pearls of fire roll along your path as\nfrom a broken necklace?\n",
                "Your fleeting steps kiss the dust of this world into sweetness, sweeping\naside all waste; the storm centred with your dancing limbs shakes the\nsacred shower of death over life and freshens her growth.\n",
                "Should you in sudden weariness stop for a moment, the world would rumble\ninto a heap, an encumbrance, barring its own progress, and even the least\nspeck of dust would pierce the sky throughout its infinity with an\nunbearable pressure.\n",
                "My thoughts are quickened by this rhythm of unseen feet round which the\nanklets of light are shaken.\n",
                "They echo in the pulse of my heart, and through my blood surges the psalm\nof the ancient sea.\n",
                "I hear the thundering flood tumbling my life from world to world and form\nto form, scattering my being in an endless spray of gifts, in sorrowings\nand songs.\n",
                "The tide runs high, the wind blows, the boat dances like thine own desire,\nmy heart!\n",
                "Leave the hoard on the shore and sail over the unfathomed dark towards\nlimitless light.\n",
                "We came hither together, friend, and now at the cross-roads I stop to bid\nyou farewell.\n",
                "Your path is wide and straight before you, but my call comes up by ways\nfrom the unknown.\n",
                "I shall follow wind and cloud; I shall follow the stars to where day breaks\nbehind the hills; I shall follow lovers who, as they walk, twine their days\ninto a wreath on a single thread of song, \"I love.\"\n",
                "It was growing dark when I asked her, \"What strange land have I come to?\"\n",
                "She only lowered her eyes, and the water gurgled in the throat of her jar,\nas she walked away.\n",
                "The trees hang vaguely over the bank, and the land appears as though it\nalready belonged to the past.\n",
                "The water is dumb, the bamboos are darkly still, a wristlet tinkles against\nthe water-jar from down the lane.\n",
                "Row no more, but fasten the boat to this tree,--for I love the look of this\nland.\n",
                "The evening star goes down behind the temple dome, and the pallor of the\nmarble landing haunts the dark water.\n",
                "Belated wayfarers sigh; for light from hidden windows is splintered into\nthe darkness by intervening wayside trees and bushes. Still that wristlet\ntinkles against the water-jar, and retreating steps rustle from down the\nlane littered with leaves.\n",
                "The night deepens, the palace towers loom spectre-like, and the town hums\nwearily.\n",
                "Row no more, but fasten the boat to a tree.\n",
                "Let me seek rest in this strange land, dimly lying under the stars, where\ndarkness tingles with the tinkle of a wristlet knocking against a\nwater-jar.\n",
                "O that I were stored with a secret, like unshed rain in summer clouds--a\nsecret, folded up in silence, that I could wander away with.\n",
                "O that I had some one to whisper to, where slow waters lap under trees that\ndoze in the sun.\n",
                "The hush this evening seems to expect a footfall, and you ask me for the\ncause of my tears.\n",
                "I cannot give a reason why I weep, for that is a secret still withheld from\nme.\n",
                "For once be careless, timid traveller, and utterly lose your way;\nwide-awake though you are, be like broad daylight enticed by and netted in\nmist.\n",
                "Do not shun the garden of Lost Hearts waiting at the end of the wrong road,\nwhere the grass is strewn with wrecked red flowers, and disconsolate water\nheaves in the troubled sea.\n",
                "Long have you watched over the store gathered by weary years. Let it be\nstripped, with nothing remaining but the desolate triumph of losing all.\n",
                "Two little bare feet flit over the ground, and seem to embody that\nmetaphor, \"Flowers are the footprints of summer.\"\n",
                "They lightly impress on the dust the chronicle of their adventure, to be\nerased by a passing breeze.\n",
                "Come, stray into my heart, you tender little feet, and leave the\neverlasting print of songs on my dreamland path.\n",
                "I am like the night to you, little flower.\n",
                "I can only give you peace and a wakeful silence hidden in the dark.\n",
                "When in the morning you open your eyes, I shall leave you to a world a-hum\nwith bees, and songful with birds.\n",
                "My last gift to you will be a tear dropped into the depth of your youth; it\nwill make your smile all the sweeter, and bemist your outlook on the\npitiless mirth of day.\n",
                "Do not stand before my window with those hungry eyes and beg for my secret.\nIt is but a tiny stone of glistening pain streaked with blood-red by\npassion.\n",
                "What gifts have you brought in both hands to fling before me in the dust?\n",
                "I fear, if I accept, to create a debt that can never be paid even by the\nloss of all I have.\n",
                "Do not stand before my window with your youth and flowers to shame my\ndestitute life.\n",
                "If I were living in the royal town of Ujjain, when Kalidas was the king's\npoet, I should know some Malwa girl and fill my thoughts with the music of\nher name. She would glance at me through the slanting shadow of her\neyelids, and allow her veil to catch in the jasmine as an excuse for\nlingering near me.\n",
                "This very thing happened in some past whose track is lost under time's dead\nleaves.\n",
                "The scholars fight to-day about dates that play hide-and-seek.\n",
                "I do not break my heart dreaming over flown and vanished ages: but alas and\nalas again, that those Malwa girls have followed them!\n",
                "To what heaven, I wonder, have they carried in their flower-baskets those\ndays that tingled to the lyrics of the king's poet?\n",
                "This morning, separation from those whom I was born too late to meet weighs\non and saddens my heart.\n",
                "Yet April carries the same flowers with which they decked their hair, and\nthe same south breeze fluttered their veils as whispers over modern roses.\n",
                "And, to tell the truth, joys are not lacking to this spring, though Kalidas\nsing no more; and I know, if he can watch me from the Poets' Paradise, he\nhas reasons to be envious.\n",
                "Be not concerned about her heart, my heart: leave it in the dark.\n",
                "What if her beauty be of the figure and her smile merely of the face? Let\nme take without question the simple meaning of her glances and be happy.\n",
                "I care not if it be a web of delusion that her arms wind about me, for the\nweb itself is rich and rare, and the deceit can be smiled at and forgotten.\n",
                "Be not concerned about her heart, my heart: be content if the music is\ntrue, though the words are not to be believed; enjoy the grace that dances\nlike a lily on the rippling, deceiving surface, whatever may lie beneath.\n",
                "Neither mother nor daughter are you, nor bride, Urvashi.[1] Woman you are,\nto ravish the soul of Paradise.\n",
                "[Footnote 1: The dancing girl of Paradise who rose from the sea.]\n",
                "When weary-footed evening comes down to the folds whither the cattle have\nreturned, you never trim the house lamps nor walk to the bridal bed with a\ntremulous heart and a wavering smile on your lips, glad that the dark hours\nare so secret.\n",
                "Like the dawn you are without veil, Urvashi, and without shame.\n",
                "Who can imagine that aching overflow of splendour which created you!\n",
                "You rose from the churned ocean on the first day of the first spring, with\nthe cup of life in your right hand and poison in your left. The monster\nsea, lulled like an enchanted snake, laid down its thousand hoods at your\nfeet.\n",
                "Your unblemished radiance rose from the foam, white and naked as a jasmine.\n",
                "Were you ever small, timid or in bud, Urvashi, O Youth everlasting?\n",
                "Did you sleep, cradled in the deep blue night where the strange light of\ngems plays over coral, shells and moving creatures of dreamlike form, till\nday revealed your awful fulness of bloom?\n",
                "Adored are you of all men in all ages, Urvashi, O endless wonder!\n",
                "The world throbs with youthful pain at the glance of your eyes, the ascetic\nlays the fruit of his austerities at your feet, the songs of poets hum and\nswarm round the perfume of your presence. Your feet, as in careless joy\nthey flit on, wound even the heart of the hollow wind with the tinkle of\ngolden bells.\n",
                "When you dance before the gods, flinging orbits of novel rhythm into space,\nUrvashi, the earth shivers, leaf and grass, and autumn fields heave and\nsway; the sea surges into a frenzy of rhyming waves; the stars drop into\nthe sky--beads from the chain that leaps till it breaks on your breast; and\nthe blood dances in men's hearts with sudden turmoil.\n",
                "You are the first break on the crest of heaven's slumber, Urvashi, you\nthrill the air with unrest. The world bathes your limbs in her tears; with\ncolour of her heart's blood are your feet red; lightly you poise on the\nwave-tossed lotus of desire, Urvashi; you play forever in that limitless\nmind wherein labours God's tumultuous dream.\n",
                "You, like a rivulet swift and sinuous, laugh and dance, and your steps sing\nas you trip along.\n",
                "I, like a bank rugged and steep, stand speechless and stock-still and\ndarkly gaze at you.\n",
                "I, like a big, foolish storm, of a sudden come rushing on and try to rend\nmy being and scatter it parcelled in a whirl of passion.\n",
                "You, like the lightning's flash slender and keen, pierce the heart of the\nturbulent darkness, to disappear in a vivid streak of laughter.\n",
                "You desired my love and yet you did not love me.\n",
                "Therefore my life clings to you like a chain of which clank and grip grow\nharsher the more you struggle to be free.\n",
                "My despair has become your deadly companion, clutching at the faintest of\nyour favours, trying to drag you away into the cavern of tears.\n",
                "You have shattered my freedom, and with its wreck built your own prison.\n",
                "I am glad you will not wait for me with that lingering pity in your look.\n",
                "It is only the spell of the night and my farewell words, startled at their\nown tune of despair, which bring these tears to my eyes. But day will dawn,\nmy eyes will dry and my heart; and there will be no time for weeping.\n",
                "Who says it is hard to forget?\n",
                "The mercy of death works at life's core, bringing it respite from its own\nfoolish persistence.\n",
                "The stormy sea is lulled at last in its rocking cradle; the forest fire\nfalls to sleep on its bed of ashes.\n",
                "You and I shall part, and the cleavage will be hidden under living grass\nand flowers that laugh in the sun.\n",
                "Of all days you have chosen this one to visit my garden.\n",
                "But the storm passed over my roses last night and the grass is strewn with\ntorn leaves.\n",
                "I do not know what has brought you, now that the hedges are laid low and\nrills run in the walks; the prodigal wealth of spring is scattered and the\nscent and song of yesterday are wrecked.\n",
                "Yet stay a while; let me find some remnant flowers, though I doubt if your\nskirt can be filled.\n",
                "The time will be short, for the clouds thicken and here comes the rain\nagain!\n",
                "I forgot myself for a moment, and I came.\n",
                "But raise your eyes, and let me know if there still linger some shadow of\nother days, like a pale cloud on the horizon that has been robbed of its\nrain.\n",
                "For a moment bear with me if I forget myself.\n",
                "The roses are still in bud; they do not yet know how we neglect to gather\nflowers this summer.\n",
                "The morning star has the same palpitating hush; the early light is enmeshed\nin the branches that overbrow your window, as in those other days.\n",
                "That times are changed I forget for a little, and have come.\n",
                "I forget if you ever shamed me by looking away when I bared my heart.\n",
                "I only remember the words that stranded on the tremor of your lips; I\nremember in your dark eyes sweeping shadows of passion, like the wings of a\nhome-seeking bird in the dusk.\n",
                "I forget that you do not remember, and I come.\n",
                "The rain fell fast. The river rushed and hissed. It licked up and swallowed\nthe island, while I waited alone on the lessening bank with my sheaves of\ncorn in a heap.\n",
                "From the shadows of the opposite shore the boat crosses with a woman at the\nhelm.\n",
                "I cry to her, \"Come to my island coiled round with hungry water, and take\naway my year's harvest.\"\n",
                "She comes, and takes all that I have to the last grain; I ask her to take\nme.\n",
                "But she says, \"No\"--the boat is laden with my gift and no room is left for\nme.\n",
                "The evening beckons, and I would fain follow the travellers who sailed in\nthe last ferry of the ebb-tide to cross the dark.\n",
                "Some were for home, some for the farther shore, yet all have ventured to\nsail.\n",
                "But I sit alone at the landing, having left my home and missed the boat:\nsummer is gone and my winter harvest is lost.\n",
                "I wait for that love which gathers failures to sow them in tears on the\ndark, that they may bear fruit when day rises anew.\n",
                "On this side of the water there is no landing; the girls do not come here\nto fetch water; the land along its edge is shaggy with stunted shrubs; a\nnoisy flock of _saliks_ dig their nests in the steep bank under whose frown\nthe fisher-boats find no shelter.\n",
                "You sit there on the unfrequented grass, and the morning wears on. Tell me\nwhat you do on this bank so dry that it is agape with cracks?\n",
                "She looks in my face and says, \"Nothing, nothing whatsoever.\"\n",
                "On this side of the river the bank is deserted, and no cattle come to\nwater. Only some stray goats from the village browse the scanty grass all\nday, and the solitary water-hawk watches from an uprooted _peepal_ aslant\nover the mud.\n",
                "You sit there alone in the miserly shade of a _shimool,_ and the morning\nwears on.\n",
                "Tell me, for whom do you wait?\n",
                "She looks in my face and says, \"No one, no one at all!\"\n"

                "Smile! But, my friend, this is not your native Paradise. Smiles are not so\ncheap in this world, where thirst, like a worm in the flower, gnaws at the\nheart's core; where baffled desire hovers round the desired, and memory\nnever ceases to sigh foolishly after vanished joy.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "Devayani, tell me how I have offended?\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "Is it so easy for you to leave this forest, which through long years has\nlavished on you shade and song? Do you not feel how the wind wails through\nthese glimmering shadows, and dry leaves whirl in the air, like ghosts of\nlost hope;--while you alone, who part from us, have a smile on your lips?\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "This forest has been a second mother to me, for here I have been born\nagain. My love for it shall never dwindle.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "When you had driven the cattle to graze on the lawn, yonder banyan tree\nspread a hospitable shade for your tired limbs against the mid-day heat.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "I bow to thee, Lord of the Forest! Remember me, when under thy shade other\nstudents chant their lessons to an accompaniment of bees humming and leaves\nrustling.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "And do not forget our Venumati, whose swift water is one stream of singing\nlove.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "I shall ever remember her, the dear companion of my exile, who, like a busy\nvillage girl, smiles on her errand of ceaseless service and croons a simple\nsong.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "But, friend, let me also remind you that you had another companion whose\nthoughts were vainly busy to make you forget an exile's cares.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "The memory of her has become a part of my life.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "I recall the day when, little more than a boy, you first arrived. You stood\nthere, near the hedge of the garden, a smile in your eyes.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "And I saw you gathering flowers--clad in white, like the dawn bathed in\nradiance. And I said, \"Make me proud by allowing me to help you!\"\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "I asked in surprise who you were, and you meekly answered that you were the\nson of Vrihaspati, a divine sage at the court of the God Indra, and desired\nto learn from my father that secret spell which can revive the dead.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "I feared lest the Master, the teacher of the Titans, those rivals of the\nGods, should refuse to accept me for a disciple.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "But he could not refuse me when I pleaded your cause, so greatly he loves\nhis daughter.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "Thrice had the jealous Titans slain me, and thrice you prevailed on your\nfather to bring me back to life; therefore my gratitude can never die.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "Gratitude! Forget all--I shall not grieve. Do you only remember benefits?\nLet them perish! If after the day's lessons, in the evening solitude, some\nstrange tremor of joy shook your heart, remember that--but not gratitude.\nIf, as some one passed, a snatch of song got tangled among your texts or\nthe swing of a robe fluttered your studies with delight, remember that when\nat leisure in your Paradise. What, benefits only!--and neither beauty nor\nlove nor...?\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "Some things are beyond the power of words.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "Yes, yes, I know. My love has sounded your heart's deepest, and makes me\nbold to speak in defiance of your reserve. Never leave me! remain here!\nfame gives no happiness. Friend, you cannot now escape, for your secret is\nmine!\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "No, no, Devayani.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "How \"No\"? Do not lie to me! Love's insight is divine. Day after day, in\nraising your head, in a glance, in the motion of your hands, your love\nspoke as the sea speaks through its waves. On a sudden my voice would send\nyour heart quivering through your limbs--have I never witnessed it? I know\nyou, and therefore you are my captive for ever. The very king of your Gods\nshall not sever this bond.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "Was it for this, Devayani, that I toiled, away from home and kindred, all\nthese years?\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "Why not? Is only knowledge precious? Is love cheap? Lay hold on this\nmoment. Have the courage to own that a woman's heart is worth all as much\npenance as men undergo for the sake of power, knowledge, or reputation.\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "I gave my solemn promise to the Gods that I would bring them this lore of\ndeathless life.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "But is it true you had eyes for nothing save your books? That you never\nbroke off your studies to pay me homage with flowers, never lay in wait for\na chance, of an evening, to help me water my flower-beds? What made you sit\nby me on the grass and sing songs you brought hither from the assembly of\nthe stars, while darkness stooped over the river bank as love droops over\nits own sad silence? Were these parts of a cruel conspiracy plotted in your\nParadise? Was all for the sake of access to my father's heart?--and after\nsuccess, were you, departing, to throw some cheap gratitude, like small\ncoins, to the deluded door-keeper?\n",
                "KACHA\n",
                "What profit were there, proud woman, in knowing the truth? If I did wrong\nto serve you with a passionate devotion cherished in secret, I have had\nample punishment. This is no time to question whether my love be true or\nnot; my life's work awaits me. Though my heart must henceforth enclose a\nred flame vainly striving to devour emptiness, still I must go back to that\nParadise which will nevermore be Paradise to me. I owe the Gods a new\ndivinity, hard won by my studies, before I may think of happiness. Forgive\nme, Devayani, and know that my suffering is doubled by the pain I\nunwillingly inflict on you.\n",
                "DEVAYANI\n",
                "Forgiveness! You have angered my heart till it is hard and burning like a\nthunderbolt! You can go back to your work and your glory, but what is left\nfor me? Memory is a bed of thorns, and secret shame will gnaw at the roots\nof my life. You came like a wayfarer, sat through the sunny hours in the\nshade of my garden, and to while time away you plucked all its flowers and\nwove them into a chain. And now, parting, you snap the thread and let the\nflowers drop on the dust! Accursed be that great knowledge you have\nearned!--a burden that, though others share equally with you, will never be\nlightened. For lack of love may it ever remain as foreign to your life as\nthe cold stars are to the un-espoused darkness of virgin Night!\n"

                "I see her figure as she steals from her work, stops at my door, and\nretreats with hesitating steps. She comes again, stands outside leaning\nagainst the wall, then slowly enters the room and sits down. With head\nbent, she plies her needle in silence; but soon stops her work, and looks\nout of the window through the rain at the blurred line of trees.\n",
                "Only this--one hour of a rainy noon filled with shadows and song and\nsilence.\n",

                "You break upon my thought like waves at the high tide, and my heart is\ndrowned under surging songs.\n",
                "My heart knew of your coming, as the night feels the approach of dawn. The\nclouds are aflame and my sky fills with a great revealing flood.\n",

                "Their little gestures return to remembrance in the covert of still hours,\nlike truants they playfully reveal things she had kept secret from me.\n",
                "My songs are like bees; they follow through the air some fragrant\ntrace--some memory--of you, to hum around your shyness, eager for its\nhidden store.\n",
                "When the freshness of dawn droops in the sun, when in the noon the air\nhangs low with heaviness and the forest is silent, my songs return home,\ntheir languid wings dusted with gold.\n",
                "I believe you had visited me in a vision before we ever met, like some\nforetaste of April before the spring broke into flower.\n",
                "That vision must have come when all was bathed in the odour of _sal_\nblossom; when the twilight twinkle of the river fringed its yellow sands,\nand the vague sounds of a summer afternoon were blended; yes, and had it\nnot laughed and evaded me in many a nameless gleam at other moments?\n",
                "I think I shall stop startled if ever we meet after our next birth, walking\nin the light of a far-away world.\n",
                "I shall know those dark eyes then as morning stars, and yet feel that they\nhave belonged to some unremembered evening sky of a former life.\n",
                "I shall know that the magic of your face is not all its own, but has stolen\nthe passionate light that was in my eyes at some immemorial meeting, and\nthen gathered from my love a mystery that has now forgotten its origin.\n",

                "Do not bend your neck and turn away your face, but offer up a kiss to me,\nwhich has been like some perfume long closed in a bud.\n",

                "You have made me great with your love, though I am but one among the many,\ndrifting in the common tide, rocking in the fluctuant favour of the world.\n",
                "You have given me a seat where poets of all time bring their tribute, and\nlovers with deathless names greet one another across the ages.\n",
                "Men hastily pass me in the market,--never noting how my body has grown\nprecious with your caress, how I carry your kiss within, as the sun carries\nin its orb the fire of the divine touch and shines for ever.\n",
                "Like a child that frets and pushes away its toys, my heart to-day shakes\nits head at every phrase I suggest, and says, \"No, not this.\"\n",
                "Yet words, in the agony of their vagueness, haunt my mind, like vagrant\nclouds hovering over hills, waiting for some chance wind to relieve them of\ntheir rain.\n",
                "But leave these vain efforts, my soul, for the stillness will ripen its own\nmusic in the dark.\n",
                "My life to-day is like a cloister during some penance, where the spring is\nafraid to stir or to whisper.\n",
                "This is not the time, my love, for you to pass the gate; at the mere\nthought of your anklet bells tinkling down the path, the garden echoes are\nashamed.\n",
                "Know that to-morrow's songs are in bud to-day, and should they see you walk\nby they would strain to breaking their immature hearts.\n",
                "Whence do you bring this disquiet, my love?\n",
                "Let my heart touch yours and kiss the pain out of your silence.\n",
                "The night has thrown up from its depth this little hour, that love may\nbuild a new world within these shut doors, to be lighted by this solitary\nlamp.\n",
                "We have for music but a single reed which our two pairs of lips must play\non by turns--for crown, only one garland to bind my hair after I have put\nit on your forehead.\n",
                "Tearing the veil from my breast I shall make our bed on the floor; and one\nkiss and one sleep of delight shall fill our small boundless world.\n",
                "All that I had I gave to you, keeping but the barest veil of reserve.\n",
                "It is so thin that you secretly smile at it and I feel ashamed.\n",
                "The gust of the spring breeze sweeps it away unawares, and the flutter of\nmy own heart moves it as the waves move their foam.\n",
                "My love, do not grieve if I keep this flimsy mist of distance round me.\n",
                "This frail reserve of mine is no mere woman's coyness, but a slender stem\non which the flower of my self-surrender bends towards you with reticent\ngrace.\n",
                "I have donned this new robe to-day because my body feels like singing.\n",
                "It is not enough that I am given to my love once and for ever, but out of\nthat I must fashion new gifts every day; and shall I not seem a fresh\noffering, dressed in a new robe?\n",
                "My heart, like the evening sky, has its endless passion for colour, and\ntherefore I change my veils, which have now the green of the cool young\ngrass and now that of the winter rice.\n",
                "To-day my robe is tinted with the rain-rimmed blue of the sky. It brings to\nmy limbs the colour of the boundless, the colour of the oversea hills; and\nit carries in its folds the delight of summer clouds flying in the wind.\n",
                "I thought I would write love's words in their own colour; but that lies\ndeep in the heart, and tears are pale.\n",
                "Would you know them, friend, if the words were colourless?\n",
                "I thought I would sing love's words to their own tune, but that sounds only\nin my heart, and my eyes are silent.\n",
                "Would you know them, friend, if there were no tune?\n",
                "In the night the song came to me; but you were not there.\n",
                "It found the words for which I had been seeking all day. Yes, in the\nstillness a moment after dark they throbbed into music, even as the stars\nthen began to pulse with light; but you were not there. My hope was to sing\nit to you in the morning; but, try as I might, though the music came, the\nwords hung back, when you were beside me.\n",
                "The night deepens and the dying flame flickers in the lamp.\n",
                "I forgot to notice when the evening--like a village girl who has filled her\npitcher at the river a last time for that day--closed the door on her\ncabin.\n",
                "I was speaking to you, my love, with mind barely conscious of my\nvoice--tell me, had it any meaning? Did it bring you any message from\nbeyond life's borders?\n",
                "For now, since my voice has ceased, I feel the night throbbing with\nthoughts that gaze in awe at the abyss of their dumbness.\n",
                "When we two first met my heart rang out in music, \"She who is eternally\nafar is beside you for ever.\"\n",
                "That music is silent, because I have grown to believe that my love is only\nnear, and have forgotten that she is also far, far away.\n",
                "Music fills the infinite between two souls. This has been muffled by the\nmist of our daily habits.\n",
                "On shy summer nights, when the breeze brings a vast murmur out of the\nsilence, I sit up in my bed and mourn the great loss of her who is beside\nme. I ask myself, \"When shall I have another chance to whisper to her words\nwith the rhythm of eternity in them?\"\n",
                "Wake up, my song, from thy languor, rend this screen of the familiar, and\nfly to my beloved there, in the endless surprise of our first meeting!\n",
                "Lovers come to you, my Queen, and proudly lay their riches at your feet:\nbut my tribute is made up of unfulfilled hopes.\n",
                "Shadows have stolen across the heart of my world and the best in me has\nlost light.\n",
                "While the fortunate laugh at my penury, I ask you to lend my failings your\ntears, and so make them precious.\n",

                "The boy woke up from sleep, felt with his hands the emptiness in the bed,\nand stole out to the open terrace.\n",
                "The boy raised his eyes to the sky and long gazed in silence. His\nbewildered mind sent abroad into the night the question, \"Where is heaven?\"\n",

                "She went away when the night was about to wane.\n",
                "My mind tried to console me by saying, \"All is vanity.\"\n",

                "Suddenly I felt a voice saying--\"Ungrateful!\"\n",

                "I made myself small, and she trifled away every moment with pelting talk.\n",
                "To-day I wish in vain that she were by me, in the gloom of the coming\nstorm, to sit in the soul's solitude.\n",
                "The name she called me by, like a flourishing jasmine, covered the whole\nseventeen years of our love. With its sound mingled the quiver of the light\nthrough the leaves, the scent of the grass in the rainy night, and the sad\nsilence of the last hour of many an idle day.\n",
                "Not the work of God alone was he who answered to that name; she created him\nagain for herself during those seventeen swift years.\n",
                "Other years were to follow, but their vagrant days, no longer gathered\nwithin the fold of that name uttered in her voice, stray and are scattered.\n",
                "They ask me, \"Who should fold us?\"\n",
                "I find no answer and sit silent, and they cry to me while dispersing, \"We\nseek a shepherdess!\"\n",
                "Whom should they seek?\n",
                "That they do not know. And like derelict evening clouds they drift in the\ntrackless dark, and are lost and forgotten.\n",
                "I feel that your brief days of love have not been left behind in those\nscanty years of your life.\n",
                "I seek to know in what place, away from the slow-thieving dust, you keep\nthem now. I find in my solitude some song of your evening that died, yet\nleft a deathless echo; and the sighs of your unsatisfied hours I find\nnestled in the warm quiet of the autumn noon.\n",
                "Your desires come from the hive of the past to haunt my heart, and I sit\nstill to listen to their wings.\n",
                "You have taken a bath in the dark sea. You are once again veiled in a\nbride's robe, and through death's arch you come back to repeat our wedding\nin the soul.\n",
                "Neither lute nor drum is struck, no crowd has gathered, not a wreath is\nhung on the gate.\n",
                "Your unuttered words meet mine in a ritual unillumined by lamps.\n",
                "I was walking along a path overgrown with grass, when suddenly I heard from\nsome one behind, \"See if you know me?\"\n",
                "I turned round and looked at her and said, \"I cannot remember your name.\"\n",
                "She said, \"I am that first great Sorrow whom you met when you were young.\"\n",
                "Her eyes looked like a morning whose dew is still in the air.\n",
                "I stood silent for some time till I said, \"Have you lost all the great\nburden of your tears?\"\n",
                "She smiled and said nothing. I felt that her tears had had time to learn\nthe language of smiles.\n",
                "\"Once you said,\" she whispered, \"that you would cherish your grief for\never.\"\n",
                "I blushed and said, \"Yes, but years have passed and I forget.\"\n",
                "Then I took her hand in mine and said, \"But you have changed.\"\n",
                "\"What was sorrow once has now become peace,\" she said.\n",
                "Our life sails on the uncrossed sea whose waves chase each other in an\neternal hide-and-seek.\n",
                "It is the restless sea of change, feeding its foaming flocks to lose them\nover and over again, beating its hands against the calm of the sky.\n",
                "Love, in the centre of this circling war-dance of light and dark, yours is\nthat green island, where the sun kisses the shy forest shade and silence is\nwooed by birds' singing.\n",
                "A painter was selling pictures at the fair; followed by servants, there\npassed the son of a minister who in youth had cheated this painter's father\nso that he had died of a broken heart.\n",
                "The boy lingered before the pictures and chose one for himself. The painter\nflung a cloth over it and said he would not sell it.\n",
                "After this the boy pined heart-sick till his father came and offered a\nlarge price. But the painter kept the picture unsold on his shop-wall and\ngrimly sat before it, saying to himself, \"This is my revenge.\"\n",
                "The sole form this painter's worship took was to trace an image of his god\nevery morning.\n",
                "And now he felt these pictures grow daily more different from those he used\nto paint.\n",
                "This troubled him, and he sought in vain for an explanation till one day he\nstarted up from work in horror, the eyes of the god he had just drawn were\nthose of the minister, and so were the lips.\n",
                "He tore up the picture, crying, \"My revenge has returned on my head!\"\n",
                "The General came before the silent and angry King and saluting him said:\n\"The village is punished, the men are stricken to dust, and the women cower\nin their unlit homes afraid to weep aloud.\"\n",
                "The High Priest stood up and blessed the King and cried: \"God's mercy is\never upon you.\"\n",
                "The Clown, when he heard this, burst out laughing and startled the court.\nThe King's frown darkened.\n",
                "\"The honour of the throne,\" said the minister, \"is upheld by the King's\nprowess and the blessing of Almighty God.\"\n",
                "Louder laughed the Clown, and the King growled,--\"Unseemly mirth!\"\n",
                "\"God has showered many blessings upon your head,\" said the Clown; \"the one\nhe bestowed on me was the gift of laughter.\"\n",
                "\"This gift will cost you your life,\" said the King, gripping his sword with\nhis right hand.\n",
                "Yet the Clown stood up and laughed till he laughed no more.\n",
                "A shadow of dread fell upon the Court, for they heard that laughter echoing\nin the depth of God's silence.\n",
                "Fiercely they rend in pieces the carpet woven during ages of prayer for the\nwelcome of the world's best hope.\n",
                "The great preparations of love lie a heap of shreds, and there is nothing\non the ruined altar to remind the mad crowd that their god was to have\ncome. In a fury of passion they seem to have burnt their future to cinders,\nand with it the season of their bloom.\n",
                "The air is harsh with the cry, \"Victory to the Brute!\" The children look\nhaggard and aged; they whisper to one another that time revolves but never\nadvances, that we are goaded to run but have nothing to reach, that\ncreation is like a blind man's groping.\n",

                "The sky stooped over the horizon to whisper to the earth, and a hush of\nexpectation filled the air. I saw the palm leaves clapping their hands to\nthe beat of inaudible music, and the moon exchanged glances with the\nglistening silence of the lake.\n",
                "The road said to me, \"Fear nothing!\" and my lute said, \"Lend me thy songs!\"\n"

Then in the distance appeared the glare of\ntorches, and bridal strains came floating up the air. We shouted for joy:\nwomen blew their conch-shells. A procession of palanquins entered the\ncourtyard: but while we were asking, \"Where is Jivaji?\" armed men burst out\nof the litters like a storm, and bore you off before we knew what had\nhappened. Shortly after, Jivaji came to tell us he had been waylaid and\ncaptured by a Mussulman noble of the Vijapur court. That night Jivaji and I\ntouched the nuptial fire and swore bloody death to this villain. After\nwaiting long, we have been freed from our solemn pledge to-night; and the\nspirit of Jivaji, who lost his life in this battle, lawfully claims you for\nwife.\n",

I remember the night\nwhen I received two secret messages, one from you, one from my mother;\nyours said: \"I send you the knife; kill him!\" My mother's: \"I send you the\npoison; end your life!\" Had unholy force dishonoured me, your double\nbidding had been obeyed. But my body was yielded only after love had given\n_me_--love all the greater, all the purer, in that it overcame the\nhereditary recoil of our blood from the Mussulman.\n",

                "The touch of an absent hand haunted him as he walked, and the air seemed to\ntake up the cry of the letter: \"Love, my love, my sky is brimming with\ntears!\"\n",
                "He asked himself in wonder, \"How do I deserve this?\"\n",
                "The sun suddenly appeared over the rim of the blue hills, and four girls\nfrom a foreign shore came with swift strides, talking loud and followed by\na barking dog.\n",
                "The two elder turned away to conceal their amusement at something strange\nin his insignificance, and the younger ones pushed each other, laughed\naloud, and ran off in exuberant mirth.\n",
                "He stopped and his head sank. Then he suddenly felt his letter, opened and\nread it again.\n",
                "The day came for the image from the temple to be drawn round the holy town\nin its chariot.\n",
                "The Queen said to the King, \"Let us go and attend the festival.\"\n",
                "Only one man out of the whole household did not join in the pilgrimage. His\nwork was to collect stalks of spear-grass to make brooms for the King's\nhouse.\n",
                "The chief of the servants said in pity to him, \"You may come with us.\"\n",
                "He bowed his head, saying, \"It cannot be.\"\n",
                "The man dwelt by the road along which the King's followers had to pass. And\nwhen the Minister's elephant reached this spot, he called to him and said,\n\"Come with us and see the God ride in his chariot!\"\n",
                "\"I dare not seek God after the King's fashion,\" said the man.\n",
                "\"How should you ever have such luck again as to see the God in his\nchariot?\" asked the Minister.\n",
                "\"When God himself comes to my door,\" answered the man.\n",
                "The Minister laughed loud and said, \"Fool! 'When God comes to your door!'\nyet a King must travel to see him!\"\n",
                "\"Who except God visits the poor?\" said the man.\n",
                "Days were drawing out as the winter ended, and, in the sun, my dog played\nin his wild way with the pet deer.\n",
                "The crowd going to the market gathered by the fence, and laughed to see the\nlove of these playmates struggle with languages so dissimilar.\n",
                "The spring was in the air, and the young leaves fluttered like flames. A\ngleam danced in the deer's dark eyes when she started, bent her neck at the\nmovement of her own shadow, or raised her ears to listen to some whisper in\nthe wind.\n",
                "The message comes floating with the errant breeze, with the rustle and\nglimmer abroad in the April sky. It sings of the first ache of youth in the\nworld, when the first flower broke from the bud, and love went forth\nseeking that which it knew not, leaving all it had known.\n",
                "And one afternoon, when among the _amlak_ trees the shadow grew grave and\nsweet with the furtive caress of light, the deer set off to run like a\nmeteor in love with death.\n",
                "It grew dark, and lamps were lighted in the house; the stars came out and\nnight was upon the fields, but the deer never came back.\n",
                "My dog ran up to me whining, questioning me with his piteous eyes which\nseemed to say, \"I do not understand!\"\n",
                "But who does ever understand?\n",
                "Our Lane is tortuous, as if, ages ago, she started in quest of her goal,\nvacillated right and left, and remained bewildered for ever.\n",
                "Above in the air, between her buildings, hangs like a ribbon a strip torn\nout of space: she calls it her sister of the blue town.\n",
                "She sees the sun only for a few moments at mid-day, and asks herself in\nwise doubt, \"Is it real?\"\n",
                "In June rain sometimes shades her band of daylight as with pencil\nhatchings. The path grows slippery with mud, and umbrellas collide. Sudden\njets of water from spouts overhead splash on her startled pavement. In her\ndismay, she takes it for the jest of an unmannerly scheme of creation.\n",
                "The spring breeze, gone astray in her coil of contortions, stumbles like a\ndrunken vagabond against angle and corner, filling the dusty air with\nscraps of paper and rag. \"What fury of foolishness! Are the Gods gone mad?\"\nshe exclaims in indignation.\n",
                "But the daily refuse from the houses on both sides--scales of fish mixed\nwith ashes, vegetable peelings, rotten fruit, and dead rats--never rouse\nher to question, \"Why should these things be?\"\n",
                "She accepts every stone of her paving. But from between their chinks\nsometimes a blade of grass peeps up. That baffles her. How can solid facts\npermit such intrusion?\n",
                "On a morning when at the touch of autumn light her houses wake up into\nbeauty from their foul dreams, she whispers to herself, \"There is a\nlimitless wonder somewhere beyond these buildings.\"\n",
                "But the hours pass on; the households are astir; the maid strolls back from\nthe market, swinging her right arm and with the left clasping the basket of\nprovisions to her side; the air grows thick with the smell and smoke of\nkitchens. It again becomes clear to our Lane that the real and normal\nconsist solely of herself, her houses, and their muck-heaps.\n",
                "The house, lingering on after its wealth has vanished, stands by the\nwayside like a madman with a patched rag over his back.\n",
                "Day after day scars it with spiteful scratches, and rainy months leave\ntheir fantastic signatures on its bared bricks.\n",
                "In a deserted upper room one of a pair of doors has fallen from rusty\nhinges; and the other, widowed, bangs day and night to the fitful gusts.\n",
                "One night the sound of women wailing came from that house. They mourned the\ndeath of the last son of the family, a boy of eighteen, who earned his\nliving by playing the part of the heroine in a travelling theatre.\n",
                "A few days more and the house became silent, and all the doors were locked.\n",
                "Only on the north side in the upper room that desolate door would neither\ndrop off to its rest nor be shut, but swung to and fro in the wind like a\nself-torturing soul.\n",
                "After a time children's voices echo once more through that house. Over the\nbalcony-rail women's clothes are hung in the sun, a bird whistles from a\ncovered cage, and a boy plays with his kite on the terrace.\n",
                "A tenant has come to occupy a few rooms. He earns little and has many\nchildren. The tired mother beats them and they roll on the floor and\nshriek.\n",
                "A maid-servant of forty drudges through the day, quarrels with her\nmistress, threatens to, but never leaves.\n",
                "Every day some small repairs are done. Paper is pasted in place of missing\npanes; gaps in the railings are made good with split bamboo; an empty box\nkeeps the boltless gate shut; old stains vaguely show through new whitewash\non the walls.\n",
                "The magnificence of wealth had found a fitting memorial in gaunt\ndesolation; but, lacking sufficient means, they try to hide this with\ndubious devices, and its dignity is outraged.\n",
                "They have overlooked the deserted room on the north side. And its forlorn\ndoor still bangs in the wind, like Despair beating her breast.\n",
                "In the depths of the forest the ascetic practised penance with fast-closed\neyes; he intended to deserve Paradise.\n",
                "But the girl who gathered twigs brought him fruits in her skirt, and water\nfrom the stream in cups made of leaves.\n",
                "The days went on, and his penance grew harsher till the fruits remained\nuntasted, the water untouched: and the girl who gathered twigs was sad.\n",
                "The Lord of Paradise heard that a man had dared to aspire to be as the\nGods. Time after time he had fought the Titans, who were his peers, and\nkept them out of his kingdom; yet he feared a man whose power was that of\nsuffering.\n",
                "But he knew the ways of mortals, and he planned a temptation to decoy this\ncreature of dust away from his adventure.\n",
                "A breath from Paradise kissed the limbs of the girl who gathered twigs, and\nher youth ached with a sudden rapture of beauty, and her thoughts hummed\nlike the bees of a rifled hive.\n",
                "The time came when the ascetic should leave the forest for a mountain cave,\nto complete the rigour of his penance.\n",
                "When he opened his eyes in order to start on this journey, the girl\nappeared to him like a verse familiar, yet forgotten, and which an added\nmelody made strange. The ascetic rose from his seat and told her that it\nwas time he left the forest.\n",
                "\"But why rob me of my chance to serve you?\" she asked with tears in her\neyes.\n",
                "He sat down again, thought for long, and remained on where he was.\n",
                "That night remorse kept the girl awake. She began to dread her power and\nhate her triumph, yet her mind tossed on the waves of turbulent delight.\n",
                "In the morning she came and saluted the ascetic and asked his blessing,\nsaying she must leave him.\n",
                "He gazed on her face in silence, then said, \"Go, and may your wish be\nfulfilled.\"\n",
                "For years he sat alone till his penance was complete.\n",
                "The Lord of the Immortals came down to tell him that he had won Paradise.\n",
                "\"I no longer need it,\" said he.\n",
                "The God asked him what greater reward he desired.\n",
                "\"I want the girl who gathers twigs.\"\n",
                "They said that Kabir, the weaver, was favoured of God, and the crowd\nflocked round him for medicine and miracles. But he was troubled; his low\nbirth had hitherto endowed him with a most precious obscurity to sweeten\nwith songs and with the presence of his God. He prayed that it might be\nrestored.\n",
                "Envious of the repute of this outcast, the priests leagued themselves with\na harlot to disgrace him. Kabir came to the market to sell cloths from his\nloom; when the woman grasped his hand, blaming him for being faithless, and\nfollowed him to his house, saying she would not be forsaken, Kabir said to\nhimself, \"God answers prayers in his own way.\"\n",
                "Soon the woman felt a shiver of fear and fell on her knees and cried, \"Save\nme from my sin!\" To which he said, \"Open your life to God's light!\"\n",
                "Kabir worked at his loom and sang, and his songs washed the stains from\nthat woman's heart, and by way of return found a home in her sweet voice.\n",
                "One day the King, in a fit of caprice, sent a message to Kabir to come and\nsing before him. The weaver shook his head: but the messenger dared not\nleave his door till his master's errand was fulfilled.\n",
                "The King and his courtiers started at the sight of Kabir when he entered\nthe hall. For he was not alone, the woman followed him. Some smiled, some\nfrowned, and the King's face darkened at the beggar's pride and\nshamelessness.\n",
                "Kabir came back to his house disgraced, the woman fell at his feet crying,\n\"Why accept such dishonour for my sake, master? Suffer me to go back to my\ninfamy!\"\n",
                "Kabir said, \"I dare not turn my God away when he comes branded with\ninsult.\"\n",
                "The man had no useful work, only vagaries of various kinds.\n",
                "Therefore it surprised him to find himself in Paradise after a life spent\nperfecting trifles.\n",
                "Now the guide had taken him by mistake to the wrong Paradise--one meant\nonly for good, busy souls.\n",
                "In this Paradise, our man saunters along the road only to obstruct the rush\nof business.\n",
                "He stands aside from the path and is warned that he tramples on sown seed.\nPushed, he starts up: hustled, he moves on.\n",
                "A very busy girl comes to fetch water from the well. Her feet run on the\npavement like rapid fingers over harp-strings. Hastily she ties a negligent\nknot with her hair, and loose locks on her forehead pry into the dark of\nher eyes.\n",
                "The man says to her, \"Would you lend me your pitcher?\"\n",
                "\"My pitcher?\" she asks, \"to draw water?\"\n",
                "\"No, to paint patterns on.\"\n",
                "\"I have no time to waste,\" the girl retorts in contempt.\n",
                "Now a busy soul has no chance against one who is supremely idle.\n",
                "Every day she meets him at the well, and every day he repeats the same\nrequest, till at last she yields.\n",
                "Our man paints the pitcher with curious colours in a mysterious maze of\nlines.\n",
                "The girl takes it up, turns it round and asks, \"What does it mean?\"\n",
                "\"It has no meaning,\" he answers.\n",
                "The girl carries the pitcher home. She holds it up in different lights and\ntries to con its mystery.\n",
                "At night she leaves her bed, lights a lamp, and gazes at it from all points\nof view.\n",
                "This is the first time she has met with something without meaning.\n",
                "On the next day the man is again near the well.\n",
                "The girl asks, \"What do you want?\"\n",
                "\"To do more work for you.\"\n",
                "\"What work?\" she enquires.\n",
                "\"Allow me to weave coloured strands into a ribbon to bind your hair.\"\n",
                "\"Is there any need?\" she asks.\n",
                "\"None whatever,\" he allows.\n",
                "The ribbon is made, and thence-forward she spends a great deal of time over\nher hair.\n",
                "The even stretch of well-employed time in that Paradise begins to show\nirregular rents.\n",
                "The elders are troubled; they meet in council.\n",
                "The guide confesses his blunder, saying that he has brought the wrong man\nto the wrong place.\n",
                "The wrong man is called. His turban, flaming with colour, shows plainly how\ngreat that blunder has been.\n",
                "The chief of the elders says, \"You must go back to the earth.\"\n",
                "The man heaves a sigh of relief: \"I am ready.\"\n",
                "The girl with the ribbon round her hair chimes in: \"I also!\"\n",
                "For the first time the chief of the elders is faced with a situation which\nhas no sense in it.\n",
                "It is said that in the forest, near the meeting of river and lake, certain\nfairies live in disguise who are only recognised as fairies after they have\nflown away.\n",
                "A Prince went to this forest, and when he came where river met lake he saw\na village girl sitting on the bank ruffling the water to make the lilies\ndance.\n",
                "He asked her in a whisper, \"Tell me, what fairy art thou?\"\n",
                "The girl laughed at the question and the hillsides echoed her mirth.\n",
                "The Prince thought she was the laughing fairy of the waterfall.\n",
                "News reached the King that the Prince had married a fairy: he sent horses\nand men and brought them to his house.\n",
                "The Queen saw the bride and turned her face away in disgust, the Prince's\nsister flushed red with annoyance, and the maids asked if that was how\nfairies dressed.\n",
                "The Prince whispered, \"Hush! my fairy has come to our house in disguise.\"\n",
                "On the day of the yearly festival the Queen said to her son, \"Ask your\nbride not to shame us before our kinsfolk who are coming to see the fairy.\"\n",
                "And the Prince said to his bride, \"For my love's sake show thy true self to\nmy people.\"\n",
                "Long she sat silent, then nodded her promise while tears ran down her\ncheeks.\n",
                "The full moon shone, the Prince, dressed in a wedding robe, entered his\nbride's room.\n",
                "No one was there, nothing but a streak of moonlight from the window aslant\nthe bed.\n",
                "The kinsfolk crowded in with the King and the Queen, the Prince's sister\nstood by the door.\n",
                "All asked, \"Where is the fairy bride?\"\n",
                "The Prince answered, \"She has vanished for ever to make herself known to\nyou.\"\n",
                "When like a flaming scimitar the hill stream has been sheathed in gloom by\nthe evening, suddenly a flock of birds passes overhead, their loud-laughing\nwings hurling their flight like an arrow among stars.\n",
                "It startles a passion for speed in the heart of all motionless things; the\nhills seem to feel in their bosom the anguish of storm-clouds, and trees\nlong to break their rooted shackles.\n",
                "For me the flight of these birds has rent a veil of stillness, and reveals\nan immense flutter in this deep silence.\n",
                "I see these hills and forests fly across time to the unknown, and darkness\nthrill into fire as the stars wing by.\n",
                "I feel in my own being the rush of the sea-crossing bird, cleaving a way\nbeyond the limits of life and death, while the migrant world cries with a\nmyriad voices, \"Not here, but somewhere else, in the bosom of the Faraway.\"\n",
                "The crowd listens in wonder to Kashi, the young singer, whose voice, like a\nsword in feats of skill, dances amidst hopeless tangles, cuts them to\npieces, and exults.\n",
                "Among the hearers sits old Rajah Pratap in weary endurance. For his own\nlife had been nourished and encircled by Barajlal's songs, like a happy\nland which a river laces with beauty. His rainy evenings and the still\nhours of autumn days spoke to his heart through Barajlal's voice, and his\nfestive nights trimmed their lamps and tinkled their bells to those songs.\n",
                "When Kashi stopped for rest, Pratap smilingly winked at Barajlal and spoke\nto him in a whisper, \"Master, now let us hear music and not this\nnew-fangled singing, which mimics frisky kittens hunting paralysed mice.\"\n",
                "The old singer with his spotlessly white turban made a deep bow to the\nassembly and took his seat. His thin fingers struck the strings of his\ninstrument, his eyes closed, and in timid hesitation his song began. The\nhall was large, his voice feeble, and Pratap shouted \"Bravo!\" with\nostentation, but whispered in his ear, \"Just a little louder, friend!\"\n",
                "The crowd was restless; some yawned, some dozed, some complained of the\nheat. The air of the hall hummed with many-toned inattention, and the song,\nlike a frail boat, tossed upon it in vain till it sank under the hubbub.\n",
                "Suddenly the old man, stricken at heart, forgot a passage, and his voice\ngroped in agony, like a blind man at a fair for his lost leader. He tried\nto fill the gap with any strain that came. But the gap still yawned: and\nthe tortured notes refused to serve the need, suddenly changed their tune,\nand broke into a sob. The master laid his head on his instrument, and in\nplace of his forgotten music, there broke from him the first cry of life\nthat a child brings into the world.\n",
                "Pratap touched him gently on his shoulder, and said, \"Come away, our\nmeeting is elsewhere. I know, my friend, that truth is widowed without\nlove, and beauty dwells not with the many, nor in the moment.\"\n",
                "In the youth of the world, Himalaya, you sprang from the rent breast of the\nearth, and hurled your burning challenges to the sun, hill after hill. Then\ncame the mellow time when you said to yourself, \"No more, no further!\" and\nyour fiery heart, that raged for the freedom of clouds, found its limits,\nand stood still to salute the limitless. After this check on your passion,\nbeauty was free to play upon your breast, and trust surrounded you with the\njoy of flowers and birds.\n",
                "You sit in your solitude like a great reader, on whose lap lies open some\nancient book with its countless pages of stone. What story is written\nthere, I wonder?--is it the eternal wedding of the divine ascetic, Shiva,\nwith Bhavani, the divine love?--the drama of the Terrible wooing the power\nof the Frail?\n",
                "I feel that my heart will leave its own colour in all your scenes, O Earth,\nwhen I bid you farewell. Some notes of mine will be added to your seasons'\nmelody, and my thoughts will breathe unrecognised through the cycle of\nshadows and sunshine.\n",
                "In far-distant days summer will come to the lovers' garden, but they will\nnot know that their flowers have borrowed an added beauty from my songs,\nnor that their love for this world has been deepened by mine.\n",
                "My eyes feel the deep peace of this sky, and there stirs through me what a\ntree feels when it holds out its leaves like cups to be filled with\nsunshine.\n",
                "A thought rises in my mind, like the warm breath from grass in the sun; it\nmingles with the gurgle of lapping water and the sigh of weary wind in\nvillage lanes,--the thought that I have lived along with the whole life of\nthis world and have given to it my own love and sorrows.\n",
                "I ask no reward for the songs I sang you. I shall be content if they live\nthrough the night, until Dawn, like a shepherd-maiden, calls away the\nstars, in alarm at the sun.\n",
                "But there were moments when you sang your songs to me, and as my pride\nknows, my Poet, you will ever remember that I listened and lost my heart.\n",
                "In the morning, when the dew glistened upon the grass, you came and gave a\npush to my swing; but, sweeping from smiles to tears, I did not know you.\n",
                "Then came April's noon of gorgeous light, and I think you beckoned me to\nfollow you.\n",
                "But when I sought your face, there passed between us the procession of\nflowers, and men and women flinging their songs to the south wind.\n",
                "Daily I passed you unheeded on the road.\n",
                "But on some days full of the faint smell of oleanders, when the wind was\nwilful among complaining palm leaves, I would stand before you wondering if\nyou ever had been a stranger to me.\n",
                "The day grew dim. The early evening star faltered near the edge of a grey\nlonely sky.\n",
                "I looked back and felt that the road lying behind me was infinitely\nremoved; traced through my life, it had only served for a single journey\nand was never to be re-travelled.\n",
                "The long story of my coming hither lies there dumb, in one meandering line\nof dust stretching from the morning hilltop to the brink of bottomless\nnight.\n",
                "I sit alone, and wonder if this road is like an instrument waiting to give\nup the day's lost voices in music when touched by divine fingers at\nnightfall.\n",
                "Give me the supreme courage of love, this is my prayer--the courage to\nspeak, to do, to suffer at thy will, to leave all things or be left alone.\nStrengthen me on errands of danger, honour me with pain, and help me climb\nto that difficult mood which sacrifices daily to thee.\n",

Far\nbelow us earth's old forests rustle and her seas chant the primal hymn of\ncreation: they sound like the wail of a memory that wanders void space in\nvain.\n",

                "I was named Somaka, the King of Videha. After sacrificing at innumerable\nshrines weary year on year, a son was born to my house in my old age, love\nfor whom, like a sudden untimely flood, swept consideration for everything\nelse from my life. He hid me completely, as a lotus hides its stem. The\nneglected duties of a king piled up in shame before my throne. One day, in\nmy audience hall, I heard my child cry from his mother's room, and\ninstantly rushed away, vacating my throne.\n",
                "RITVIK\n",
                "Just then, it chanced, I entered the hall to give him my daily benediction;\nin blind haste he brushed me aside and enkindled my anger. When later he\ncame back, shame-faced, I asked him: \"King, what desperate alarm could draw\nyou at the busiest hour of the day to the women's apartments, so as to\ndesert your dignity and duty--ambassadors come from friendly courts, the\naggrieved who ask for justice, your ministers waiting to discuss matters of\ngrave import? and even lead you to slight a Brahmin's blessing?\"\n",
                "SOMAKA\n",
                "At first my heart flamed with anger; the next moment I trampled it down\nlike the raised head of a snake and meekly replied: \"Having only one child,\nI have lost my peace of mind. Forgive me this once, and I promise that in\nfuture the father's infatuation shall never usurp the King.\"\n",
                "RITVIK\n",
                "But my heart was bitter with resentment, and I said, \"If you must be\ndelivered from the curse of having only one child, I can show you the way.\nBut so hard is it that I feel certain you will fail to follow it.\" This\ngalled the King's pride and he stood up and exclaimed, \"I swear, by all\nthat is sacred, as a Kshatriya and a King, I will not shrink, but perform\nwhatever you may ask, however hard.\" \"Then listen,\" said I. \"Light a\nsacrificial fire, offer up your son: the smoke that rises will bring you\nprogeny, as the clouds bring rain.\" The King bowed his head upon his breast\nand remained silent: the courtiers shouted their horror, the Brahmins\nclapped their hands over their ears, crying, \"Sin it is both to utter and\nlisten to such words.\" After some moments of bewildered dismay the King\ncalmly said, \"I will abide by my promise.\" The day came, the fire was lit,\nthe town was emptied of its people, the child was called for; but the\nattendants refused to obey, the soldiers rebelliously went off duty,\nthrowing down their arms. Then I, who in my wisdom had soared far above all\nweakness of heart and to whom emotions were illusory, went myself to the\napartment where, with their arms, women fenced the child like a flower\nsurrounded by the menacing branches of a tree. He saw me and stretched out\neager hands and struggled to come to me, for he longed to be free from the\nlove that imprisoned him. Crying, \"I am come to give you true deliverance,\"\nI snatched him by force from his fainting mother and his nurses wailing in\ndespair. With quivering tongues the fire licked the sky and the King stood\nbeside it, still and silent, like a tree struck dead by lightning.\nFascinated by the godlike splendour of the blaze, the child babbled in glee\nand danced in my arms, impatient to seek an unknown nurse in the free glory\nof those flames.\n",

Ah! who was that unhappy woman whose eyes kissed\nyour bare, slim body through tears that blessed you, where she sat among\nthe women of the royal household behind the arras? Why, the mother of\nArjuna! Then the Brahmin, master of arms, stepped forth and said, \"No youth\nof mean birth may challenge Arjuna to a trial of strength.\" You stood\nspeechless, like a thunder-cloud at sunset flashing with an agony of\nsuppressed light. But who was the woman whose heart caught fire from your\nshame and anger, and flared up in silence? The mother of Arjuna! Praised be\nDuryodhana, who perceived your worth, and then and there crowned you King\nof Anga, thus winning the Kauravas a champion. Overwhelmed at this good\nfortune, Adhiratha, the charioteer, broke through the crowd; you instantly\nrushed to him and laid your crown at his feet amid the jeering laughter of\nthe Pandavas and their friends.

Your shame permeates the\nvast darkness and sends invisible shivers through my limbs. Leave my\nquestion unanswered! Never explain to me what made you rob your son of his\nmother's love!

Ask me not to leave those who are doomed\nto defeat. Let the Pandavas win the throne, since they must: I remain with\nthe desperate and forlorn. On the night of my birth you left me naked and\nunnamed to disgrace: leave me once again without pity to the calm\nexpectation of defeat and death!\n"
