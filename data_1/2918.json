                "SCENE I",
                "It is six o'clock of a November evening, in KEITH DARRANT'S study. A\n      large, dark-curtained room where the light from a single reading-lamp\n      falling on Turkey carpet, on books beside a large armchair, on the deep\n      blue-and-gold coffee service, makes a sort of oasis before a log fire. In\n      red Turkish slippers and an old brown velvet coat, KEITH DARRANT sits\n      asleep. He has a dark, clean-cut, clean-shaven face, dark grizzling hair,\n      dark twisting eyebrows.",
                "[The curtained door away out in the dim part of the room behind him is\n        opened so softly that he does not wake. LARRY DARRANT enters and stands\n        half lost in the curtain over the door. A thin figure, with a worn, high\n        cheek-boned face, deep-sunk blue eyes and wavy hair all ruffled -- a\n        face which still has a certain beauty. He moves inwards along the wall,\n        stands still again and utters a gasping sigh. KEITH stirs in his chair.]",
                "KEITH. Who's there?",
                "LARRY. [In a stifled voice] Only I -- Larry.",
                "KEITH. [Half-waked] Come in! I was asleep. [He does not turn his head,\n      staring sleepily at the fire.]",
                "The sound of LARRY's breathing can be heard. [Turning his head a little]\n        Well, Larry, what is it? LARRY comes skirting along the wall, as if\n        craving its support, outside the radius of the light. [Staring] Are you\n        ill? LARRY stands still again and heaves a deep sigh.",
                "KEITH. [Rising, with his back to the fire, and staring at his brother]\n      What is it, man? [Then with a brutality born of nerves suddenly ruffled]\n      Have you committed a murder that you stand there like a fish?",
                "LARRY. [In a whisper] Yes, Keith.",
                "KEITH. [With vigorous disgust] By Jove! Drunk again! [In a voice changed\n      by sudden apprehension] What do you mean by coming here in this state? I\n      told you --  --  If you weren't my brother --  -- ! Come here,\n      where I can we you! What's the matter with you, Larry?",
                "[With a lurch LARRY leaves the shelter of the wall and sinks into a\n        chair in the circle of light.]",
                "LARRY. It's true.",
                "[KEITH steps quickly forward and stares down into his brother's eyes,\n        where is a horrified wonder, as if they would never again get on terms\n        with his face.]",
                "KEITH. [Angry, bewildered-in a low voice] What in God's name is this\n      nonsense?",
                "[He goes quickly over to the door and draws the curtain aside, to see\n        that it is shut, then comes back to LARRY, who is huddling over the\n        fire.]",
                "Come, Larry! Pull yourself together and drop exaggeration! What on earth\n      do you mean?",
                "LARRY. [In a shrill outburst] It's true, I tell you; I've killed a man.",
                "KEITH. [Bracing himself; coldly] Be quiet!",
                "LARRY lifts his hands and wrings them.",
                "[Utterly taken aback] Why come here and tell me this?",
                "LARRY. Whom should I tell, Keith? I came to ask what I'm to do --  give\n      myself up, or what?",
                "KEITH. When -- when -- what --  -- ?",
                "LARRY. Last night.",
                "KEITH. Good God! How? Where? You'd better tell me quietly from the\n      beginning. Here, drink this coffee; it'll clear your head.",
                "He pours out and hands him a cup of coffee. LARRY drinks it off.",
                "LARRY. My head! Yes! It's like this, Keith -- there's a girl --  --",
                "KEITH. Women! Always women, with you! Well?",
                "LARRY. A Polish girl. She -- her father died over here when she was\n      sixteen, and left her all alone. There was a mongrel living in the same\n      house who married her -- or pretended to. She's very pretty, Keith. He\n      left her with a baby coming. She lost it, and nearly starved. Then another\n      fellow took her on, and she lived with him two years, till that brute\n      turned up again and made her go back to him. He used to beat her black and\n      blue. He'd left her again when -- I met her. She was taking anybody\n      then. [He stops, passes his hand over his lips, looks up at KEITH, and\n      goes on defiantly] I never met a sweeter woman, or a truer, that I swear.\n      Woman! She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that devil\n      had found her out again. He came for me -- a bullying, great, hulking\n      brute. Look! [He touches a dark mark on his forehead] I took his ugly\n      throat, and when I let go -- [He stops and his hands drop.]",
                "KEITH. Yes?",
                "LARRY. [In a smothered voice] Dead, Keith. I never knew till afterwards\n      that she was hanging on to him -- to h-help me. [Again he wrings his\n      hands.]",
                "KEITH. [In a hard, dry voice] What did you do then?",
                "LARRY. We -- we sat by it a long time.",
                "KEITH. Well?",
                "LARRY. Then I carried it on my back down the street, round a corner, to an\n      archway.",
                "KEITH. How far?",
                "LARRY. About fifty yards.",
                "KEITH. Was -- did anyone see?",
                "LARRY. No.",
                "KEITH. What time?",
                "LARRY. Three in the morning.",
                "KEITH. And then?",
                "LARRY. Went back to her.",
                "KEITH. Why -- in heaven's name?",
                "LARRY. She way lonely and afraid. So was I, Keith.",
                "KEITH. Where is this place?",
                "LARRY. Forty-two Borrow Square, Soho.",
                "KEITH. And the archway?",
                "LARRY. Corner of Glove Lane.",
                "KEITH. Good God! Why, I saw it in the paper this morning. They were\n      talking of it in the Courts! [He snatches the evening paper from his\n      armchair, and runs it over anal reads] Here it is again. \"Body of a man\n      was found this morning under an archway in Glove Lane. From marks about\n      the throat grave suspicion of foul play are entertained. The body had\n      apparently been robbed.\" My God! [Suddenly he turns] You saw this in the\n      paper and dreamed it. D'you understand, Larry? -- you dreamed it.",
                "LARRY. [Wistfully] If only I had, Keith!",
                "[KEITH makes a movement of his hands almost like his brother's.]",
                "KEITH. Did you take anything from the-body?",
                "LARRY. [Drawing au envelope from his pocket] This dropped out while we\n      were struggling.",
                "KEITH. [Snatching it and reading] \"Patrick Walenn\" -- Was that his\n      name? \"Simon's Hotel, Farrier Street, London.\" [Stooping, he puts it in\n      the fire] No! -- that makes me --  -- [He bends to pluck it out,\n      stays his hand, and stamps it suddenly further in with his foot] What in\n      God's name made you come here and tell me? Don't you know I'm -- I'm\n      within an ace of a Judgeship?",
                "LARRY. [Simply] Yes. You must know what I ought to do. I didn't, mean to\n      kill him, Keith. I love the girl -- I love her. What shall I do?",
                "KEITH. Love!",
                "LARRY. [In a flash] Love! -- That swinish brute! A million creatures\n      die every day, and not one of them deserves death as he did. But but I\n      feel it here. [Touching his heart] Such an awful clutch, Keith. Help me if\n      you can, old man. I may be no good, but I've never hurt a fly if I could\n      help it. [He buries his face in his hands.]",
                "KEITH. Steady, Larry! Let's think it out. You weren't seen, you say?",
                "LARRY. It's a dark place, and dead night.",
                "KEITH. When did you leave the girl again?",
                "LARRY. About seven.",
                "KEITH. Where did you go?",
                "LARRY. To my rooms.",
                "KEITH. To Fitzroy Street?",
                "LARRY. Yes.",
                "KEITH. What have you done since?",
                "LARRY. Sat there -- thinking.",
                "KEITH. Not been out?",
                "LARRY. No.",
                "KEITH. Not seen the girl?",
                "[LARRY shakes his head.]",
                "Will she give you away?",
                "LARRY. Never.",
                "KEITH. Or herself hysteria?",
                "LARRY. No.",
                "KEITH. Who knows of your relations with her?",
                "LARRY. No one.",
                "KEITH. No one?",
                "LARRY. I don't know who should, Keith.",
                "KEITH. Did anyone see you go in last night, when you first went to her?",
                "LARRY. No. She lives on the ground floor. I've got keys.",
                "KEITH. Give them to me.",
                "LARRY takes two keys from his pocket and hands them to his brother.",
                "LARRY. [Rising] I can't be cut off from her!",
                "KEITH. What! A girl like that?",
                "LARRY. [With a flash] Yes, a girl like that.",
                "KEITH. [Moving his hand to put down old emotion] What else have you that\n      connects you with her?",
                "LARRY. Nothing.",
                "KEITH. In your rooms?",
                "[LARRY shakes his head.]",
                "Photographs? Letters?",
                "LARRY. No.",
                "KEITH. Sure?",
                "LARRY. Nothing.",
                "KEITH. No one saw you going back to her?",
                "[LARRY shakes his head. ] Nor leave in the morning? You can't be\n        certain.",
                "LARRY. I am.",
                "KEITH. You were fortunate. Sit down again, man. I must think.",
                "He turns to the fire and leans his elbows on the mantelpiece and his\n        head on his hands. LARRY Sits down again obediently.",
                "KEITH. It's all too unlikely. It's monstrous!",
                "LARRY. [Sighing it out] Yes.",
                "KEITH. This Walenn -- was it his first reappearance after an absence?",
                "LARRY. Yes.",
                "KEITH. How did he find out where she was?",
                "LARRY. I don't know.",
                "KEITH. [Brutally] How drunk were you?",
                "LARRY. I was not drunk.",
                "KEITH. How much had you drunk, then?",
                "LARRY. A little claret -- nothing!",
                "KEITH. You say you didn't mean to kill him.",
                "LARRY. God knows.",
                "KEITH. That's something.",
                "LARRY. He hit me. [He holds up his hands] I didn't know I was so strong.",
                "KEITH. She was hanging on to him, you say? -- That's ugly.",
                "LARRY. She was scared for me.",
                "KEITH. D'you mean she -- loves you?",
                "LARRY. [Simply] Yes, Keith.",
                "KEITH. [Brutally] Can a woman like that love?",
                "LARRY. [Flashing out] By God, you are a stony devil! Why not?",
                "KEITH. [Dryly] I'm trying to get at truth. If you want me to help, I must\n      know everything. What makes you think she's fond of you?",
                "LARRY. [With a crazy laugh] Oh, you lawyer! Were you never in a woman's\n      arms?",
                "KEITH. I'm talking of love.",
                "LARRY. [Fiercely] So am I. I tell you she's devoted. Did you ever pick up\n      a lost dog? Well, she has the lost dog's love for me. And I for her; we\n      picked each other up. I've never felt for another woman what I feel for\n      her -- she's been the saving of me!",
                "KEITH. [With a shrug] What made you choose that archway?",
                "LARRY. It was the first dark place.",
                "KEITH. Did his face look as if he'd been strangled?",
                "LARRY. Don't!",
                "KEITH. Did it?",
                "[LARRY bows his head.]",
                "Very disfigured?",
                "LARRY. Yes.",

                "KEITH. Why not?",
                "LARRY. [In an outburst] I'm not made of iron, like you. Why not? If you\n      had done it --  -- !",
                "KEITH. [Holding up his hand] You say he was disfigured. Would he be\n      recognisable?",
                "LARRY. [Wearily] I don't know.",
                "KEITH. When she lived with him last -- where was that?",
                "LARRY. In Pimlico, I think.",
                "KEITH. Not Soho?",
                "[LARRY shakes his head.]",
                "How long has she been at this Soho place?",
                "LARRY. Nearly a year.",
                "KEITH. Living this life?",

                "KEITH. Now listen, Larry. When you leave here, go straight home, and stay\n      there till I give you leave to go out again. Promise.",
                "LARRY. I promise.",
                "KEITH. Is your promise worth anything?",
                "LARRY. [With one of his flashes] \"Unstable as water, he shall not excel!\"",
                "KEITH. Exactly. But if I'm to help you, you must do as I say. I must have\n      time to think this out. Have you got money?",
                "LARRY. Very little.",
                "KEITH. [Grimly] Half-quarter day -- yes, your quarter's always spent by\n      then. If you're to get away -- never mind, I can manage the money.",

                "KEITH. [Sardonically] Privilege of A brother. As it happens, I'm thinking\n      of myself and our family. You can't indulge yourself in killing without\n      bringing ruin. My God! I suppose you realise that you've made me an\n      accessory after the fact -- me, King's counsel -- sworn to the\n      service of the Law, who, in a year or two, will have the trying of cases\n      like yours! By heaven, Larry, you've surpassed yourself!",
                "LARRY. [Bringing out a little box] I'd better have done with it.",

Just one -- and they may do what they\n      like to you, and you won't know it. Snap your fingers at all the tortures.\n      It's a great comfort! Have one to keep by you?",
                "KEITH. Come, Larry! Hand it over.",
                "LARRY. [Replacing the box] Not quite! You've never killed a man, you see.\n      [He gives that crazy laugh.] D'you remember that hammer when we were boys\n      and you riled me, up in the long room? I had luck then. I had luck in\n      Naples once. I nearly killed a driver for beating his poor brute of a\n      horse. But now -- ! My God! [He covers his face.]",

                "SCENE II",
                "At out eleven o'clock the following night an WANDA'S room on the ground\n        floor in Soho. In the light from one close-shaded electric bulb the room\n        is but dimly visible. A dying fire burns on the left. A curtained window\n        in the centre of the back wall. A door on the right. The furniture is\n        plush-covered and commonplace, with a kind of shabby smartness. A couch,\n        without back or arms, stands aslant, between window and fire. [On this\n        WANDA is sitting, her knees drawn up under her, staring at the embers.\n        She has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over it; her bare feet are\n        thrust into slippers. Her hands are crossed and pressed over her breast.\n        She starts and looks up, listening. Her eyes are candid and startled,\n        her face alabaster pale, and its pale brown hair, short and square-cut,\n        curls towards her bare neck. The startled dark eyes and the faint rose\n        of her lips are like colour-staining on a white mask.] [Footsteps as of\n        a policeman, very measured, pass on the pavement outside, and die away.\n        She gets up and steals to the window, draws one curtain aside so that a\n        chink of the night is seen. She opens the curtain wider, till the shape\n        of a bare, witch-like tree becomes visible in the open space of the\n        little Square on the far side of the road. The footsteps are heard once\n        more coming nearer. WANDA closes the curtains and cranes back. They pass\n        and die again. She moves away and looking down at the floor between door\n        and couch, as though seeing something there; shudders; covers her eyes;\n        goes back to the couch and down again just as before, to stare at the\n        embers. Again she is startled by noise of the outer door being opened.\n        She springs up, runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door.\n        By the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the dark\n        window-curtains, listening. There comes the sound of subdued knocking on\n        her door. She stands in breathless terror. The knocking is repeated. The\n        sound of a latchkey in the door is heard. Her terror leaves her. The\n        door opens; a man enters in a dark, fur overcoat.]",
                "WANDA. [In a voice of breathless relief, with a rather foreign accent] Oh!\n      it's you, Larry! Why did you knock? I was so frightened. Come in! [She\n      crosses quickly, and flings her arms round his neck] [Recoiling -- in a\n      terror-stricken whisper] Oh! Who is it?",
                "KEITH. [In a smothered voice] A friend of Larry's. Don't be frightened.",
                "She has recoiled again to the window; and when he finds the switch and\n        turns the light up, she is seen standing there holding her dark wrapper\n        up to her throat, so that her face has an uncanny look of being detached\n        from the body.",
                "[Gently] You needn't be afraid. I haven't come to do you harm --  quite\n      the contrary. [Holding up the keys] Larry wouldn't have given me these,\n      would he, if he hadn't trusted me?",
                "WANDA does not move, staring like a spirit startled out of the flesh.",
                "[After looking round him] I'm sorry to have startled you.",
                "WANDA. [In a whisper] Who are you, please?",
                "KEITH. Larry's brother.",
                "WANDA, with a sigh of utter relief, steals forward to the couch and\n        sinks down. KEITH goes up to her.",
                "He'd told me.",
                "WANDA. [Clasping her hands round her knees.] Yes?",
                "KEITH. An awful business!",
                "WANDA. Yes; oh, yes! Awful -- it is awful!",
                "KEITH. [Staring round him again.] In this room?",
                "WANDA. Just where you are standing. I see him now, always falling.",
                "KEITH. [Moved by the gentle despair in her voice] You -- look very\n      young. What's your name?",
                "WANDA. Wanda.",
                "KEITH. Are you fond of Larry?",
                "WANDA. I would die for him!",
                "[A moment's silence.]",
                "KEITH. I -- I've come to see what you can do to save him.",
                "WANDA, [Wistfully] You would not deceive me. You are really his brother?",
                "KEITH. I swear it.",
                "WANDA. [Clasping her hands] If I can save him! Won't you sit down?",
                "KEITH. [Drawing up a chair and sitting] This, man, your -- your\n      husband, before he came here the night before last -- how long since\n      you saw him?",
                "WANDA. Eighteen month.",
                "KEITH. Does anyone about here know you are his wife?",
                "WANDA. No. I came here to live a bad life. Nobody know me. I am quite\n      alone.",
                "KEITH. They've discovered who he was -- you know that?",
                "WANDA. No; I have not dared to go out.",
                "KEITH: Well, they have; and they'll look for anyone connected with him, of\n      course.",
                "WANDA. He never let people think I was married to him. I don't know if I\n      was -- really. We went to an office and signed our names; but he was a\n      wicked man. He treated many, I think, like me.",
                "KEITH. Did my brother ever see him before?",
                "WANDA. Never! And that man first went for him.",
                "KEITH. Yes. I saw the mark. Have you a servant?",
                "WANDA. No. A woman come at nine in the morning for an hour.",
                "KEITH. Does she know Larry?",
                "WANDA. No. He is always gone.",

                "WANDA. No; I am verree quiet. Since I know your brother, I see no one,\n      sare.",
                "KEITH. [Sharply] Do you mean that?",
                "WANDA. Oh, yes! I love him. Nobody come here but him for a long time now.",
                "KEITH. How long?",
                "WANDA. Five month.",
                "KEITH. So you have not been out since --  -- ?",
                "[WANDA shakes her head.]",
                "What have you been doing?",
                "WANDA. [Simply] Crying. [Pressing her hands to her breast] He is in danger\n      because of me. I am so afraid for him.",
                "KEITH. [Checking her emotion] Look at me.",
                "[She looks at him.]",
                "If the worst comes, and this man is traced to you, can you trust yourself\n      not to give Larry away?",
                "WANDA. [Rising and pointing to the fire] Look! I have burned all the\n      things he have given me -- even his picture. Now I have nothing from\n      him.",
                "KEITH. [Who has risen too] Good! One more question. Do the police know you -- because -- of\n      your life?",
                "[She looks at him intently, and shakes her, head.]",
                "You know where Larry lives?",
                "WANDA. Yes.",
                "KEITH. You mustn't go there, and he mustn't come to you.",
                "[She bows her head; then, suddenly comes close to him.]",
                "WANDA. Please do not take him from me altogether. I will be so careful. I\n      will not do anything to hurt him. But if I cannot see him sometimes, I\n      shall die. Please do not take him from me.",
                "[She catches his hand and presses it desperately between her own.]",
                "KEITH. Leave that to me. I'm going to do all I can.",
                "WANDA. [Looking up into his face] But you will be kind?",
                "Suddenly she bends and kisses his hand. KEITH draws his hand away, and\n        she recoils a little humbly, looking up at him again. Suddenly she\n        stands rigid, listening.",
                "[In a whisper] Listen! Someone -- out there!",
                "She darts past him and turns out the light. There is a knock on the\n        door. They are now close together between door and window. [Whispering]\n        Oh! Who is it?",
                "KEITH. [Under his breath] You said no one comes but Larry.",
                "WANDA. Yes, and you have his keys. Oh! if it is Larry! I must open!",
                "KEITH shrinks back against the wall. WANDA goes to the door.",
                "[Opening the door an inch] Yes? Please? Who?",
                "A thin streak of light from a bull's-eye lantern outside plays over the\n        wall. A Policeman's voice says: \"All right, Miss. Your outer door's\n        open. You ought to keep it shut after dark, you know.\"",

                "WANDA. [Sighing] I did not think they did, sir. It is so long I was not\n      out in the town; not since I had Larry.",
                "KEITH gives her an intent look, then crosses to the fire. He stands\n        there a moment, looking down, then turns to the girl, who has crept back\n        to the couch.",
                "KEITH. [Half to himself] After your life, who can believe -- -? Look\n      here! You drifted together and you'll drift apart, you know. Better for\n      him to get away and make a clean cut of it.",
                "WANDA. [Uttering a little moaning sound] Oh, sir! May I not love, because\n      I have been bad? I was only sixteen when that man spoiled me. If you knew --  --",
                "KEITH. I'm thinking of Larry. With you, his danger is much greater.\n      There's a good chance as things are going. You may wreck it. And for what?\n      Just a few months more of -- well -- you know.",
                "WANDA. [Standing at the head of the couch and touching her eyes with her\n      hands] Oh, sir! Look! It is true. He is my life. Don't take him away from\n      me.",
                "KEITH. [Moved and restless] You must know what Larry is. He'll never stick\n      to you.",
                "WANDA. [Simply] He will, sir.",
                "KEITH. [Energetically] The last man on earth to stick to anything! But for\n      the sake of a whim he'll risk his life and the honour of all his family. I\n      know him.",
                "WANDA. No, no, you do not. It is I who know him.",
                "KEITH. Now, now! At any moment they may find out your connection with that\n      man. So long as Larry goes on with you, he's tied to this murder, don't\n      you see?",

                "KEITH. They've taken up a vagabond who robbed the body. He pawned a\n      snake-shaped ring, and they identified this Walenn by it. I've been down\n      and seen him charged myself.",

                "WANDA. [Faintly] Larry!",
                "KEITH. He's in no danger. They always get the wrong man first. It'll do\n      him no harm to be locked up a bit -- hyena like that. Better in prison,\n      anyway, than sleeping out under archways in this weather.",
                "LARRY. What was he like, Keith?",
                "KEITH. A little yellow, ragged, lame, unshaven scarecrow of a chap. They\n      were fools to think he could have had the strength.",
