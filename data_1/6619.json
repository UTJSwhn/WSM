                "I lived far more than e'er I sang;\nThought, ire, and mirth unceasing rang\n  Around me, where I guested;\nTo be where loud life's battles call\nFor me was well-nigh more than all\n  My pen on page arrested.\n",
                "What's true and strong has growing-room,\nAnd will perhaps eternal bloom,\n  Without black ink's salvation,\nAnd he will be, who least it planned,\nBut in life's surging dared to stand,\nThe best bard for his nation.\n",
                "A life seventy-seven years long and but two hundred pages of\nlyrical production, more than half of which was written in about\na dozen years!  The seeming disproportion is explained by the\nlines just quoted from the poem _Good Cheer_, with which Bj\u00f6rnson\nconcluded the first edition of his _Poems and Songs_.  Alongside\nof these stanzas, in which the cause of his popularity and powerful\ninfluence is also unconsciously revealed, may well be placed the\nfollowing one from _The Poet_, which discloses to us the larger\nconception of the mission that Bj\u00f6rnson himself in all his work\nand life, no less than in his lyrics, so finely fulfilled:\n",
                "The poet does the prophet's deeds;\nIn times of need with new life pregnant,\nWhen strife and suffering are regnant,\nHis faith with light ideal leads.\nThe past its heroes round him posts,\nHe rallies now the present's hosts,\n             The future opes\n             Before his eyes,\n             Its pictured hopes\n             He prophesies.\n   Ever his people's forces vernal\n   The poet frees, --by right eternal.\n",
                "\"The best bard for his nation\" is he who \"does the prophet's\ndeeds,\" who \"rallies now the present's hosts,\" and \"frees,\n--by right eternal.\"  Poet and prophet Bj\u00f6rnson was, but more\nthan all else the leader of the Norwegian people, \"where loud\nlife's battles call,\" through conflict unto liberation and growth.\nIt has been said that twice in the nineteenth century the national\nsoul of Norway embodied itself in individual men,--during the\nfirst half in Henrik Wergeland and during the second half in\nBj\u00f6rnstjerne Bj\u00f6rnson.  True as this is of the former, it is\nstill more true of the latter, for the history of Norway shows\nthat the soul of its people expresses itself best through will\nand action.  Bj\u00f6rnson throughout all his life willed and wrought\nso much for his country, that he could give relatively little\ntime and power to lyrical self-expression.\n",
                "But Bj\u00f6rnson strikingly represented the past of Norway as well\nas his contemporary age.  He was a modern blending of the heroic\nchieftain and the gifted skald of ancient times.  He was the first\nleader of his country in a period when the battles of the spirit\non the fields of politics and economics, ethics, and esthetics\nwere the only form of conflict,--a leader evoking, developing,\nand guiding the powers of his nation into fuller and higher life.\nIn his many-sidedness Bj\u00f6rnson was also in his time the first\nskald of his people, almost equally endowed with genius as a\nnarrative, a dramatic, and a lyric poet; with talents scarcely\nless remarkable as an orator, a theater-director, a journalistic\ntribune of the people (his newspaper articles amounted, roughly\nestimated, to ten thousand book-pages), a letter-writer, and a\nconversationalist.\n",
                "If, furthermore, we take into account also Bj\u00f6rnson's labors and\nachievements in the domain of action more narrowly considered, it\nis no wonder that his _Poems and Songs_ make only a small volume.\nExamining the book more closely, we find that three-quarters of\nits pages were written before the year 1875, so that the lyrical\noutput, here published, of the thirty-four years thereafter\namounts to but fifty pages.  From the year 1874 on in Bj\u00f6rnson's\nlife the chieftain supplanted the skald, so far as lyrical\nutterance was concerned.  He was leading his nation in thought and\naction on the fields of theology and religion, of politics, economics,\nand social reform; he was tireless in making speeches, in writing\nletters and newspaper articles; his poetic genius flowed out\ncopiously in the dramatic and epic channels of his numerous modern\nplays, novels, and stories.\n",
                "That soon after 1874 Bj\u00f6rnson passed through a crisis in his\npersonal thought and inner life was probably, in view of the\nsufficient explanation suggested above, without influence in\nlessening his production of short poems.  This crisis was in his\nreligious beliefs. His father was a clergyman in the Lutheran State\nChurch, and from his home in western Norway Bj\u00f6rnson brought with\nhim to Christiania in 1850 fervent Christian faith of the older\northodox sort.  Here his somewhat somber religion was soon made\nbrighter and more tender by the adoption of Grundtvig's teachings,\nand until past mid-life he remained a sincere Christian in the fullest\nsense, as is repeatedly shown in his lyrics.  But in the years\njust before 1877 study of modern science and philosophy, of the\nhistory of the Church and dogma, led him to become an evolutionist,\nan agnostic theist.  Nevertheless, he ever practiced the Christian\nart of life, as he tried to realize his ideals of truth, justice,\nand love of humanity.  This large and simple Christian art of life,\nin distinction from the dogmas of the Church, he early sung in\nlines which sound no less true to the keynote of his later years:\n",
                "Love thy neighbor, to Christ be leal!\nCrush him never with iron-heel,\n   Though in the dust he's lying!\nAll the living responsive await\nLove with power to recreate,\n   Needing alone the trying.\n"

                "The quantity, then, of Bj\u00f6rnson's short poems is small.  Their\nintrinsic worth is great.  Their influence in Norway has been broad\nand deep, they are known and loved by all.  If lyrical means only\nmelodious, \"singable,\" they possess high poetic value and distinction.\nIn a unique degree they have inspired composers of music to pour out\ntheir strains.  When a Scandinavian reads Bj\u00f6rnson's poems, his ears\nring with the familiar melodies into which they have almost sung\nthemselves.\n",
                "Here is not the place for technical analysis of the external poetic\nforms.  A cursory inspection will show that Bj\u00f6rnson's are wonderfully\nvaried, and that the same form is seldom, if ever, precisely duplicated.\nIn rhythm and alliteration, rhyme sequence and the grouping of lines into\nstanzas, the form in each case seems to be determined by the content,\nnaturally, spontaneously.  Yet for one who has intimately studied these\nverses until his mind and heart vibrate responsively, the words of all\nhave an indefinable melody of their own, as it were, one dominant melody,\ndistinctly Bj\u00f6rnsonian.  This unity in variety, spontaneous and\ncharacteristic, is not found in the earlier poems not included in this\nvolume.  So far as is known, Bj\u00f6rnson's first printed poem appeared in a\nnewspaper in 1852.  It and other youthful rhymes of that time extant in\nmanuscript, and still others as late as 1854, are interesting by reason\nof their contrast with his later manner; the verse-form has nothing\npersonal, the melodies are those of older poets.  It is in the lyrics\nof _Synn\u00f6ve Solbakken_, written in 1857 or just before, that Bj\u00f6rnson\nfor the first time sings in his own forms his own melody.\n",
                "Style and diction are the determining factors in the poetic form of\nlyric verse, along with the perhaps indistinguishable and indefinable\nquality of melodiousness.  Of Bj\u00f6rnson's style or manner in the larger\nsense it must be said that it is not subjectively lyrical.  He is not\ndisposed to introspective dwelling on his own emotions and to profuse\nself-expression without a conscious purpose.  In general he must have\nsome definite objective end in view, some occasion to celebrate for\nothers, some \"cause\" to champion, the mood of another person or of\nother persons, real or fictitious, to reproduce synthetically in a\ncombination of thoughts, feelings, similes, and sounds.  In his\nverses words do not breed words, nor figures beget figures unto lyric\nbreadth and vagueness.  When Bj\u00f6rnson was moved to make a poem, he was\nso filled with the end, the occasion, the cause, the mood to be\nreproduced, that he was impatient of any but the most significant\nwords and left much to suggestion.  Often the words seem to be in one\nanother's way, and they are not related with grammatical precision.\nThus in the original more than in the translation of the poem\n_Norway, Norway!_ the first strophe of which is:\n                     Norway, Norway,\n          Rising in blue from the sea's gray and green,\n          Islands around like fledglings tender,\n          Fjord-tongues with slender\n          Tapering tips in the silence seen.\n                    Rivers, valleys,\n          Mate among mountains, wood-ridge and slope\n          Wandering follow.  Where the wastes lighten,\n          Lake and plain brighten,\n          Hallow a temple of peace and hope.\n                    Norway, Norway,\n          Houses and huts, not castles grand,\n                    Gentle or hard,\n                    Thee we guard, thee we guard,\n          Thee, our future's fair land.\n",
                "Such abrupt brevity of expression, not uncommon among Norwegian\npeasants, was no doubt natural to Bj\u00f6rnson, but was confirmed by\nthe influence of the Old Norse sagas and skaldic poetry.  The\nlatter may also have increased his use of alliteration, masterly\nnot only in the direct imitation of the old form, as in _Bergliot_,\nbut also in the enrichment of the music of his rhymed verse in\nmodern forms. Conciseness of style in thought and word permitted\nno lyrical elaboration of figures or descriptions; it restricted\nthe poet to brief hints of the ways his spirit would go, and along\nwhich he wished to guide that of the hearer or reader.  Herein is\nthe source of much of the power of Bj\u00f6rnson's patriotic songs and\npoems of public agitation.  Those who read or hear or sing them\nare made to think, or at least to feel, the unwritten poetry\nbetween the lines.  Scarcely less notable is this paucity in the\nexpression of wealth of thought and feeling in the memorial and\nother more individual poems.\n",
                "Bj\u00f6rnson's diction corresponds to the quality of style thus\nbriefly characterized.  The modern Norwegian language has no\nconsiderable, highly developed special vocabulary for poetic use.\nFrom the diction of prose the poet must quarry and carve the verbal\nmaterial for his verse.  It sometimes seems, indeed, as if it were\nhard for Bj\u00f6rnson to find the right block and fit it, nicely cut,\ninto his line.  In describing his diction critics have used the\nfigures of hewing and of hammer-strokes, but then have said that\nit is not so much laborious effort we hear as the natural falling\ninto place of words heavy with thought and feeling.  Here it is\nthat translation must so often come short of faithful reproduction.\nThe choice of words in relation to rhythm and euphony is a mystery\ndifficult to interpret even in the poet's own language.  If we\ntry to analyze the verse of great poets, we frequently find, beyond\nwhat is evidently the product of conscious design, effects of\nsuggestion and sound which could not be calculated and designed.\nThe verbal material seems hardly to be amenable to the poet's\ncontrol, but rather to be chosen, shaped, and placed involuntarily\nby the thought and the mood.  _The Ocean_ is a good example of\nthe distinctive power and beauty of Bj\u00f6rnson's diction.\n",
                "Such, then, in melody, rhythm, style, and diction is the form of\nBj\u00f6rnson's verse: compact, reticent, suggestive, without elaborate\nverbal ornamentation, strong with \"the long-vibrating power of the\ndeeply felt, but half-expressed.\"  It challenges and stimulates\nthe soul of the hearer or reader to an intense activity of\nappropriation, which brings a fine reward.\n"

                "What, now, is the content that finds expression in this form?\nAs we turn the pages from the beginning, we first meet lyrics that\nmay be called personal, not utterances of Bj\u00f6rnson's individual\nself, but taken from his early tales and the drama _Halte Hulda_,\nwith strains of love, of religious faith, of dread of nature, and\nof joy in it, of youthful longing; then after two patriotic choral\nsongs and a second group of similar personal poems from _A Happy Boy_\nfollow one on a patriotic subject with historical allusions, a\nmemorial poem on J. L. Heiberg, and one descriptive, indeed, of\nthe ocean, but filled with the human feelings and longings it arouses;\nthen come a lyric personal to Bj\u00f6rnson, and one that is not.  As we\nprogress, we pass through a similar succession of descriptive,\npersonal, or memorial poems, some of religious faith, historical\nballads, lyrical romances, patriotic and festival choral songs,\npoems in celebration of individual men and women, living or dead,\nand towards the end poems, like the _Psalms_, of deep philosophic\nthought suffused with emotion.\n",
                "Now these subjects may be gathered into a small number of groups:\nlove, religious faith and thought, moods personal to the poet,\npatriotism,--love of country, striving for its welfare, pride in\nNorway's history, and joy in the beauty and grandeur of its scenery.\nThe occasional songs and poems in celebration of great personalities,\n--whether they were of high station and renown, or lowly and unfamed,\n--or for festivals, earnest or jovial, are nearly all conceived in the\nspirit of patriotism,--love of Norway, its historic past, its present,\nits future.  They may be social songs memorial or political poems,\nballads or lyrical romances,--all are inspired by and inspire love of country.\n",
                "Not very many of Bj\u00f6rnson's lyrics have love as their subject. From\nhis tales, novels, and dramas we know that his understanding of love\nwas comprehensive and subtle, yet this volume contains but few of\nthe love-lyrics of strong emotion, which Bj\u00f6rnson must have felt,\nif not written.  He was a man of will and action with altruistic\nideals; sexual love could not be the whole nor the center of life\nfor him.\n",
                "Nor are the purely religious poems numerous, although Christian faith\nis at once the ground and the atmosphere of his lyrics in the earlier\nperiod, and some of the latest are expressions of a broad and deep\nphilosophy of life.  \"Love thy neighbor!\" and \"Light, Love, Life\" in\ndeeds were characteristic of Bj\u00f6rnson, rather than the utterance of\npassive meditations of a theoretic nature on God and man's relation to Him.\n",
                "Bj\u00f6rnson's unfailing bent towards activity in behalf of others could\nnot favor either the lyric outpouring of other purely personal moods.\nSuch purely personal poems are then also relatively rare.  Some of\nthem, however, are most beautiful and deeply moving.  Generally he\nfrees himself in an epic or dramatic way from subjective introspection;\nhe projects his feeling into another personality or sends it forth\nin choral song in terms of \"we\" and \"our.\"  The moods he does express\nmore directly for himself are vague youthful longing for the great\nand the instant, joyous trustfulness even in adversity and under\ncriticism, love of parents, wife, family, and friends, faith in the\nfuture and in the power of the good to prevail.\n",
                "By far the largest number of the _Poems and Songs_ have as their\nsubject patriotism in the broadest sense, a theme at once simple and\ncomplex.  It is in them that the skald and chieftain so typically\nblend in one.  Of this group the influence has been widest and\ndeepest.  In his oration at the unveiling of the statue of Wergeland\nin Christiania, Bj\u00f6rnson spoke of him and of Norway's constitution\nas growing up together; with reference to this it has been maintained\nthat we have still greater right to say that Bj\u00f6rnson and Norway's\nfull freedom and independence grew up together.  The truth of the\nstatement is very largely due to Bj\u00f6rnson's patriotic poems.  Through\nthem the poet-prophet interpreted for his nation the historic past\nand the evolving present, and forecast the future.  Simplifying\nthe meaning of life, he accomplished the mission which he himself\nmade the ideal of _The Poet_, and became for his own people the\nliberalizing teacher and molder, leading them to freedom in thought\nand action, in social and political life.  Of this large and seemingly\ncomplex group of patriotic lyrics,--whether they be on its history,\nor on contemporaneous events and deeds of individuals with political\nsignificance; or on men, both known and unknown to fame, who had made\nand were making Norway great; or on historical, political, and other\nnational festivals; or on the country, its land and sea and fjords and\nforests and fields and cities, in aspects more genial or more stern,\n--whether they be poems of the individual or social and choral songs,\nmanorial poems or ballads or lyrical romances, or descriptions of\nNorway's scenery,--the unifying simple theme is Norway to be loved\nand labored for.\n",
                "Not a single poem is, however, merely descriptive of external nature.\nBj\u00f6rnson's relation to nature is indeed more intimate than that of\nany other Norwegian writer of his time, but here also he is epic and\ndramatic rather than subjectively lyrical.  He sees and hears through\nwhat is external, and his feeling for and with nature is but a\nprofounder looking into the soul of his nation or the inner life of\nother human beings.  For him Norway's scenery is filled with the\nglory of the nation's past, the promise of its future, or the needs\nof the present.  The poems that contain nature descriptions are\nprimarily patriotic.  In the national hymn _Yes, We Love_, it is the\nnation, its history and its future, which with the land towers as a\nwhole before his vision; in _Romsdal_ the scenery frames the people,\ntheir character and life.  More personal poems, as _To Molde_ or\n_A Meeting_, are not merely descriptive; in the former childhood's\nmemories and the love of friends fill the scene, while in the latter\nthe freshly and tenderly drawn snow-landscape is but the setting for\na vivid picture of a deceased friend.\n",
                "The contents of this volume befit the verse-form, as if each were\nmade by and for the other.  The subjects are simple, large, weighty;\nthe form is compact, strong, suggestive.  Bj\u00f6rnson is distinctly not\nsubjectively lyrical, but has a place in the first rank \"as a choral\nlyric poet and as an epic lyric poet.\" (Collin.)  Georg Brandes\nwrote of him many years ago: \"In few [fields] has he put forth\nanything so individual, unforgettable, imperishable, as in the lyric\nfield.\"\n"

                "  And living echoes answered! Lo, there swarmed\nElves of the Stage about him, as he played!\nThey made the lamps to burn, and reared the grotto,\nThey brought and brushed the costumes Holberg knew,\nAnd in them played their pranks 'neath powdered wigs,--\nRoamed on the mountains of a summer night\nAnd stole the saeter-maiden while she slept,\nAnd filled with mortal fear the aged wooer!\nThey danced the goblin-dance in dusk of winter,\nPlayed hide-and-seek with their own shadows;\nThey snared the hypocrite in his own sighs,\nIn his own web the pettifogger bound;\nThey scattered wide the hoard a miser gathered,\nThey tripped and threw the petty parish-pope\nThey saved the tears of innocence seduced\nAnd on the altar laid as lustrous pearls;\nThey melted hatred in the ice-hard breast,\nIt fell as rain upon the enemy's fields;\nThey bound the slanderer, Mazeppa-like,\nUpon the back of his wild calumnies;--\nThe crafty man of stealthy selfishness\nThey set afloat within an open boat;--\nBut one who freely gave himself, his all,\nThey bore to heaven upon their joyous laughter.\nThey drew the magic ring round those who loved,\nAnd to the altar led the blushing pair.\nThey brought heroic forms from barrows old\nTo tower in might among the teeming present.\n--There was not one could longer rest in peace;\nHimself, his folly, all our country's need,\nWholeness victorious, halfness doomed to fail,\nThe power of honest faith, the wreck of doubt,--\nAll this our nation saw in its own image,\nWhen strongly lighted on the Stage 't was set.--\n",
                "  And she was part of this! The first full tone\nThrilled her breast too and woke a thousand mem'ries\nOf something that she ne'er before had known!\nOn that first evening, when the curtain rose,\nWith timid step one clad in white came forth\nAnd begged for Norway's art, for our young drama\nA home in Norway,--but with so great fear,\nThe gentle voice was trembling, dim the eyes;\nYet from the voice, the eyes, the form, the bearing\nWas heard a promise in sweet modesty;\nFor she who spoke those first words on this Stage,\nThat maiden dark with eyes so deep and true,\nLo, it was she!\n",
                "               And soon her art shone clear\nAnd softly radiant through the evening hours.--\nWith fairy lightness fell its magic gleams\nOn hidden longings, sorrows half-concealed,--\nBut gently, tenderly. If joy she touched,\n'T was always softly. But we all could feel\nA stream of power so full, that if she had\nIn an unguarded hour let it flow free\nWith all its deep and swelling tide sincere,\nIt would have borne herself from earth away.\n",
                "  In truth, the calmness of her course through life\nWas never weakness, but was strength controlled;\nWas never fear, but veneration deep\nFor those whose souls are great: a model she\nFor noble women as for forceful men,--\nThis wreath we weave for her pure memory.\n",
                "  But what she thus had early taught herself,\nShe taught to others. When upon the stage\nShe stood, depicting woman's painful conflict\nWith rudeness, violence, and wild desire,\nThen,--though she wielded but a woman's weapons,\nHer silent dignity, her subtle smile,\nHer light derision, all-subduing laughter,--\nA spirit-dawn gleamed from their flashing play,\nTo usher in a day of victory.\nShe barriers raised around the woman weak\n(Down-trodden in a half-built social order),\nShe stood forth here so many an evening-hour\nAnd talked to thousands of a woman's worth.\nthough her call was not fully to free\nAll that a woman's heart may hope and dream,\nShe shielded it secure in all its beauty.\n",
                "This conflict made her reticent, severe;--\nBut sometimes in a song her spirit could\nSend forth glad tidings, messages of freedom,\nHer large free soul revealing. _Then_ we heard\nSuch longing after full, unbroken peace,\nOur thoughts were captive held by sad foreboding.--\n",
                "  'T is now come true!--The crape of mourning droops\nAbout her name, the tolling bell is still.\nHer final summons gather us once more\nBefore her stage, and here our thanks we utter\nFor what she gave us. So as _she_ had given,\nHas no one given. She gave of her sorrow,\nWith bleeding heart beneath her winsome smile.\nShe shared with us the tears her conflict brought,\nThe radiant glory of her victory.\n",

                "You never came here; but I go\nHere often and am met by you.\nEach room and road here must renew\nThe thought of you and your form show\nStanding with helpful hand extended,\nAs when long since in trust and deed\nMy home you from my foes defended.\n",
                "      ...\n",
                "So often, while I wrote this book,\nThe light shone from your genial eye;\nThen we were one, both you and I\nAnd what in silence being took;\nSo here and there the book possesses\nYour spirit and your heart's fresh faith,\nAnd therefore now your name it blesses.\n",
                "I love the air, when growing colder\n     It, clear and high,\n     The purer sky\nBroadens with sense of freedom bolder.\n",
                "I find in forests joy the keenest\n     In autumn days\n     When fancy plays,\nAnd not when they are young and greenest.\n",
                "I knew a man: in autumn clearness\n     His even course,--\n     His heart's fine force\nLike autumn sky in soft-hued sheerness.\n",
                "His memory is, as--when a-swarming\n     The cold blasts first\n     Of winter burst--\nThe gentle flame my room first warming.\n",
                "When all our outward longings falter,\n     And summer's mind\n     Within we find,\nIs friendship's feast round autumn's altar.\n"
