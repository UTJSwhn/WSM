                "Thou hast nor youth nor age\n       But as it were an after dinner sleep\n       Dreaming of both.",
                "Here I am, an old man in a dry month,\n     Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.\n     I was neither at the hot gates\n     Nor fought in the warm rain\n     Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,\n     Bitten by flies, fought.\n     My house is a decayed house,\n     And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,\n     Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,\n     Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.\n     The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;\n     Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.\n     The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,\n     Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.\n\n                       I an old man,\n     A dull head among windy spaces.\n\n     Signs are taken for wonders. \"We would see a sign\":\n     The word within a word, unable to speak a word,\n     Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year\n     Came Christ the tiger\n\n     In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\n     To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\n     Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero\n     With caressing hands, at Limoges\n     Who walked all night in the next room;\n     By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\n     By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\n     Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\n     Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\n     Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,\n     An old man in a draughty house\n     Under a windy knob.\n\n     After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\n     History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\n     And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\n     Guides us by vanities. Think now\n     She gives when our attention is distracted\n     And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\n     That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\n     What's not believed in, or if still believed,\n     In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\n     Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with\n     Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think\n     Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\n     Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues\n     Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\n     These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\n\n     The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\n     We have not reached conclusion, when I\n     Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last\n     I have not made this show purposelessly\n     And it is not by any concitation\n     Of the backward devils.\n     I would meet you upon this honestly.\n     I that was near your heart was removed therefrom\n     To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\n     I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\n     Since what is kept must be adulterated?\n     I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\n     How should I use it for your closer contact?\n\n     These with a thousand small deliberations\n     Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,\n     Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\n     With pungent sauces, multiply variety\n     In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,\n     Suspend its operations, will the weevil\n     Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\n     Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\n     In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\n     Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\n     White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\n     And an old man driven by the Trades\n     To a sleepy corner.\n\n                       Tenants of the house,\n     Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season."

Her shuttered barge\n     Burned on the water all the day.\n\n     But this or such was Bleistein's way:\n     A saggy bending of the knees\n     And elbows, with the palms turned out,\n     Chicago Semite Viennese.\n\n     A lustreless protrusive eye\n     Stares from the protozoic slime\n     At a perspective of Canaletto.\n     The smoky candle end of time\n\n     Declines. On the Rialto once.\n     The rats are underneath the piles.\n     The jew is underneath the lot.\n     Money in furs. The boatman smiles,\n\n     Princess Volupine extends\n     A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand\n     To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,\n     She entertains Sir Ferdinand\n\n     Klein. Who clipped the lion's wings\n     And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?\n     Thought Burbank, meditating on\n     Time's ruins, and the seven laws."

                "Let us go then, you and I,\n     When the evening is spread out against the sky\n     Like a patient etherized upon a table;\n     Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\n     The muttering retreats\n     Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\n     And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\n     Streets that follow like a tedious argument\n     Of insidious intent\n     To lead you to an overwhelming question....\n     Oh, do not ask, \"What is it?\"\n     Let us go and make our visit.\n\n     In the room the women come and go\n     Talking of Michelangelo.\n\n     The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\n     The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\n     Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\n     Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\n     Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\n     Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\n     And seeing that it was a soft October night,\n     Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.\n\n     And indeed there will be time\n     For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\n     Rubbing its back upon the window panes;\n     There will be time, there will be time\n     To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet\n     There will be time to murder and create,\n     And time for all the works and days of hands\n     That lift and drop a question on your plate;\n     Time for you and time for me,\n     And time yet for a hundred indecisions,\n     And for a hundred visions and revisions,\n     Before the taking of a toast and tea.\n\n     In the room the women come and go\n     Talking of Michelangelo.\n\n     And indeed there will be time\n     To wonder, \"Do I dare?\" and, \"Do I dare?\"\n     Time to turn back and descend the stair,\n     With a bald spot in the middle of my hair -- \n     (They will say: \"How his hair is growing thin!\")\n     My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\n     My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin -- \n     (They will say: \"But how his arms and legs are thin!\")\n     Do I dare\n     Disturb the universe?\n     In a minute there is time\n     For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\n\n     For I have known them all already, known them all:\n     Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\n     I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\n     I know the voices dying with a dying fall\n     Beneath the music from a farther room.\n       So how should I presume?\n\n     And I have known the eyes already, known them all -- \n     The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\n     And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\n     When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\n     Then how should I begin\n     To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\n       And how should I presume?\n\n     And I have known the arms already, known them all -- \n     Arms that are braceleted and white and bare\n     (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\n     Is it perfume from a dress\n     That makes me so digress?\n     Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\n       And should I then presume?\n       And how should I begin?\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n     Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\n     And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\n     Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?\n\n     I should have been a pair of ragged claws\n     Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n     And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\n     Smoothed by long fingers,\n     Asleep... tired... or it malingers.\n     Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\n     Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,\n     Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\n     But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\n     Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\n     I am no prophet -- and here's no great matter;\n     I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\n     And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\n     And in short, I was afraid.\n\n     And would it have been worth it, after all,\n     After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\n     Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\n     Would it have been worth while,\n     To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\n     To have squeezed the universe into a ball\n     To roll it toward some overwhelming question,\n     To say: \"I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\n     Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\" -- \n     If one, settling a pillow by her head,\n       Should say: \"That is not what I meant at all;\n       That is not it, at all.\"\n\n     And would it have been worth it, after all,\n     Would it have been worth while,\n     After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\n     After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\n         floor -- \n     And this, and so much more? -- \n     It is impossible to say just what I mean!\n     But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\n     Would it have been worth while\n     If one, settling a  pillow or throwing off a shawl,\n     And turning toward the window, should say:\n       \"That is not it at all,\n       That is not what I meant, at all.\"\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n     No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\n     Am an attendant lord, one that will do\n     To swell a progress, start a scene or two,\n     Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\n     Deferential, glad to be of use,\n     Politic, cautious, and meticulous;\n     Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\n     At times, indeed, almost ridiculous -- \n     Almost, at times, the Fool.\n\n     I grow old... I grow old...\n     I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\n\n     Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\n     I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\n     I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\n\n     I do not think that they will sing to me.\n\n     I have seen them riding seaward on the waves\n     Combing the white hair of the waves blown back\n     When the wind blows the water white and black.\n\n     We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\n     By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\n     Till human voices wake us, and we drown."

He must be unbalanced,\" -- \n     \"There was something he said that I might have challenged.\"\n     Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah\n     I remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon."

I\n     was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary\n     recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her\n     throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An\n     elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly\n     spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty\n     green iron table, saying: \"If the lady and gentleman\n     wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and\n     gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden...\" I\n     decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be\n     stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might\n     be collected, and I concentrated my attention with\n     careful subtlety to this end."
