                "April is the cruellest month, breeding\n  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n  Memory and desire, stirring\n  Dull roots with spring rain.\n  Winter kept us warm, covering\n  Earth in forgetful snow, feeding\n  A little life with dried tubers.\n  Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\n  With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\n  And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,                            10\n  And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\n  Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\n  And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,\n  My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,\n  And I was frightened. He said, Marie,\n  Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.\n  In the mountains, there you feel free.\n  I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\n\n  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n  Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  20\n  You cannot say, or guess, for you know only\n  A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\n  And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\n  And the dry stone no sound of water. Only\n  There is shadow under this red rock,\n  (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\n  And I will show you something different from either\n  Your shadow at morning striding behind you\n  Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\n  I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              30\n       Frisch weht der Wind\n       Der Heimat zu\n       Mein Irisch Kind,\n       Wo weilest du?\n  \"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\n  \"They called me the hyacinth girl.\"\n   -- Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\n  Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\n  Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\n  Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    40\n  Looking into the heart of light, the silence.\n  Oed' und leer das Meer.\n\n  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\n  Had a bad cold, nevertheless\n  Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\n  With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,\n  Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,\n  (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)\n  Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\n  The lady of situations.                                                 50\n  Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\n  And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\n  Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,\n  Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find\n  The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.\n  I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.\n  Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,\n  Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:\n  One must be so careful these days.\n\n  Unreal City,                                                            60\n  Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,\n  A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\n  I had not thought death had undone so many.\n  Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\n  And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\n  Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,\n  To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\n  With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\n  There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying \"Stetson!\n  \"You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!                            70\n  \"That corpse you planted last year in your garden,\n  \"Has it begun to sprout?

                "V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID",
                "After the torchlight red on sweaty faces\n  After the frosty silence in the gardens\n  After the agony in stony places\n  The shouting and the crying\n  Prison and palace and reverberation\n  Of thunder of spring over distant mountains\n  He who was living is now dead\n  We who were living are now dying\n  With a little patience                                                  330\n\n  Here is no water but only rock\n  Rock and no water and the sandy road\n  The road winding above among the mountains\n  Which are mountains of rock without water\n  If there were water we should stop and drink\n  Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think\n  Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand\n  If there were only water amongst the rock\n  Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit\n  Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit                              340\n  There is not even silence in the mountains\n  But dry sterile thunder without rain\n  There is not even solitude in the mountains\n  But red sullen faces sneer and snarl\n  From doors of mudcracked houses\n                                                           If there were water\n  And no rock\n  If there were rock\n  And also water\n  And water                                                               350\n  A spring\n  A pool among the rock\n  If there were the sound of water only\n  Not the cicada\n  And dry grass singing\n  But sound of water over a rock\n  Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees\n  Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n  But there is no water\n\n  Who is the third who walks always beside you?\n  When I count, there are only you and I together                         360\n  But when I look ahead up the white road\n  There is always another one walking beside you\n  Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded\n  I do not know whether a man or a woman\n   -- But who is that on the other side of you?\n\n  What is that sound high in the air\n  Murmur of maternal lamentation\n  Who are those hooded hordes swarming\n  Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth\n  Ringed by the flat horizon only                                         370\n  What is the city over the mountains\n  Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air\n  Falling towers\n  Jerusalem Athens Alexandria\n  Vienna London\n  Unreal\n\n  A woman drew her long black hair out tight\n  And fiddled whisper music on those strings\n  And bats with baby faces in the violet light\n  Whistled, and beat their wings                                          380\n  And crawled head downward down a blackened wall\n  And upside down in air were towers\n  Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours\n  And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\n\n  In this decayed hole among the mountains\n  In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing\n  Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel\n  There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.\n  It has no windows, and the door swings,\n  Dry bones can harm no one.                                              390\n  Only a cock stood on the rooftree\n  Co co rico co co rico\n  In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust\n  Bringing rain\n\n  Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves\n  Waited for rain, while the black clouds\n  Gathered far distant, over Himavant.\n  The jungle crouched, humped in silence.\n  Then spoke the thunder\n  DA                                                                      400\n  Datta: what have we given?\n  My friend, blood shaking my heart\n  The awful daring of a moment's surrender\n  Which an age of prudence can never retract\n  By this, and this only, we have existed\n  Which is not to be found in our obituaries\n  Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider\n  Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor\n  In our empty rooms\n  DA                                                                      410\n  Dayadhvam: I have heard the key\n  Turn in the door once and turn once only\n  We think of the key, each in his prison\n  Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison\n  Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours\n  Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus\n  DA\n  Damyata: The boat responded\n  Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar\n  The sea was calm, your heart would have responded                       420\n  Gaily, when invited, beating obedient\n  To controlling hands\n\n                                       I sat upon the shore\n  Fishing, with the arid plain behind me\n  Shall I at least set my lands in order?\n  London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down\n  Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina\n  Quando fiam ceu chelidon  --  O swallow swallow\n  Le Prince d'Aquitaine \u00c3\u00a0 la tour abolie\n  These fragments I have shored against my ruins                          430\n  Why then Ile fit you.
