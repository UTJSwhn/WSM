                "SCENE I",
                "The curtain rises on the BARTHWICK'S dining-room, large, modern, and\n        well furnished; the window curtains drawn. Electric light is burning. On\n        the large round dining-table is set out a tray with whisky, a syphon,\n        and a silver cigarette-box. It is past midnight. A fumbling is heard\n        outside the door. It is opened suddenly; JACK BARTHWICK seems to fall\n        into the room. He stands holding by the door knob, staring before him,\n        with a beatific smile. He is in evening dress and opera hat, and carries\n        in his hand a sky-blue velvet lady's reticule. His boyish face is\n        freshly coloured and clean-shaven. An overcoat is hanging on his arm.",
                "JACK. Hello! I've got home all ri --  -- [Defiantly.] Who says I\n      sh'd never 've opened th' door without 'sistance. [He staggers in,\n      fumbling with the reticule. A lady's handkerchief and purse of crimson\n      silk fall out.] Serve her joll' well right -- everything droppin' out.\n      Th' cat. I 've scored her off -- I 've got her bag. [He swings the\n      reticule.] Serves her joly' well right. [He takes a cigarette out of the\n      silver box and puts it in his mouth.] Never gave tha' fellow anything! [He\n      hunts through all his pockets and pulls a shilling out; it drops and rolls\n      away. He looks for it.] Beastly shilling! [He looks again.] Base\n      ingratitude! Absolutely nothing. [He laughs.] Mus' tell him I've got\n      absolutely nothing.",
                "[He lurches through the door and down a corridor, and presently returns,\n        followed by JONES, who is advanced in liquor. JONES, about thirty years\n        of age, has hollow cheeks, black circles round his eyes, and rusty\n        clothes: He looks as though he might be unemployed, and enters in a\n        hang-dog manner.]",
                "JACK. Sh! sh! sh! Don't you make a noise, whatever you do. Shu' the door,\n      an' have a drink. [Very solemnly.] You helped me to open the door -- I\n      've got nothin, for you. This is my house. My father's name's Barthwick;\n      he's Member of Parliament -- Liberal Member of Parliament: I've told\n      you that before. Have a drink! [He pours out whisky and drinks it up.] I'm\n      not drunk [Subsiding on a sofa.] Tha's all right. Wha's your name? My\n      name's Barthwick, so's my father's; I'm a Liberal too -- wha're you?",
                "JONES. [In a thick, sardonic voice.] I'm a bloomin' Conservative. My\n      name's Jones! My wife works 'ere; she's the char; she works 'ere.",
                "JACK. Jones? [He laughs.] There's 'nother Jones at College with me. I'm\n      not a Socialist myself; I'm a Liberal -- there's ve -- lill\n      difference, because of the principles of the Lib -- Liberal Party.\n      We're all equal before the law -- tha's rot, tha's silly. [Laughs.]\n      Wha' was I about to say? Give me some whisky.",
                "[JONES gives him the whisky he desires, together with a squirt of\n        syphon.]",
                "Wha' I was goin' tell you was -- I 've had a row with her. [He waves\n      the reticule.] Have a drink, Jonessh 'd never have got in without you -- tha\n      's why I 'm giving you a drink. Don' care who knows I've scored her off.\n      Th' cat! [He throws his feet up on the sofa.] Don' you make a noise,\n      whatever you do. You pour out a drink -- you make yourself good long,\n      long drink -- you take cigarette -- you take anything you like. Sh'd\n      never have got in without you. [Closing his eyes.] You're a Tory -- you're\n      a Tory Socialist. I'm Liberal myself -- have a drink -- I 'm an\n      excel'nt chap.",
                "[His head drops back. He, smiling, falls asleep, and JONES stands\n        looking at him; then, snatching up JACK's glass, he drinks it off. He\n        picks the reticule from off JACK'S shirt-front, holds it to the light,\n        and smells at it.]",
                "JONES. Been on the tiles and brought 'ome some of yer cat's fur. [He\n      stuffs it into JACK's breast pocket.]",
                "JACK. [Murmuring.] I 've scored you off! You cat!",
                "[JONES looks around him furtively; he pours out whisky and drinks it.\n        From the silver box he takes a cigarette, puffs at it, and drinks more\n        whisky. There is no sobriety left in him.]",
                "JONES. Fat lot o' things they've got 'ere! [He sees the crimson purse\n      lying on the floor.] More cat's fur. Puss, puss! [He fingers it, drops it\n      on the tray, and looks at JACK.] Calf! Fat calf! [He sees his own\n      presentment in a mirror. Lifting his hands, with fingers spread, he stares\n      at it; then looks again at JACK, clenching his fist as if to batter in his\n      sleeping, smiling face. Suddenly he tilts the rest o f the whisky into the\n      glass and drinks it. With cunning glee he takes the silver box and purse\n      and pockets them.] I 'll score you off too, that 's wot I 'll do!",
                "[He gives a little snarling laugh and lurches to the door. His shoulder\n        rubs against the switch; the light goes out. There is a sound as of a\n        closing outer door.]",
                "The curtain falls.",
                "The curtain rises again at once.",
                "SCENE II",
                "In the BARTHWICK'S dining-room. JACK is still asleep; the morning light\n        is coming through the curtains. The time is half-past eight. WHEELER,\n        brisk person enters with a dust-pan, and MRS. JONES more slowly with a\n        scuttle.",
                "WHEELER. [Drawing the curtains.] That precious husband of yours was round\n      for you after you'd gone yesterday, Mrs. Jones. Wanted your money for\n      drink, I suppose. He hangs about the corner here half the time. I saw him\n      outside the \"Goat and Bells\" when I went to the post last night. If I were\n      you I would n't live with him. I would n't live with a man that raised his\n      hand to me. I wouldn't put up with it. Why don't you take your children\n      and leave him? If you put up with 'im it'll only make him worse. I never\n      can see why, because a man's married you, he should knock you about.",
                "MRS. JONES. [Slim, dark-eyed, and dark-haired; oval-faced, and with a\n      smooth, soft, even voice; her manner patient, her way of talking quite\n      impersonal; she wears a blue linen dress, and boots with holes.] It was\n      nearly two last night before he come home, and he wasn't himself. He made\n      me get up, and he knocked me about; he didn't seem to know what he was\n      saying or doing. Of course I would leave him, but I'm really afraid of\n      what he'd do to me. He 's such a violent man when he's not himself.",
                "WHEELER. Why don't you get him locked up? You'll never have any peace\n      until you get him locked up. If I were you I'd go to the police court\n      tomorrow. That's what I would do.",
                "MRS. JONES. Of course I ought to go, because he does treat me so badly\n      when he's not himself. But you see, Bettina, he has a very hard time -- he\n      's been out of work two months, and it preys upon his mind. When he's in\n      work he behaves himself much better. It's when he's out of work that he's\n      so violent.",
                "WHEELER. Well, if you won't take any steps you 'll never get rid of him.",
                "MRS. JONES. Of course it's very wearing to me; I don't get my sleep at\n      nights. And it 's not as if I were getting help from him, because I have\n      to do for the children and all of us. And he throws such dreadful things\n      up at me, talks of my having men to follow me about. Such a thing never\n      happens; no man ever speaks to me. And of course, it's just the other way.\n      It's what he does that's wrong and makes me so unhappy. And then he 's\n      always threatenin' to cut my throat if I leave him. It's all the drink,\n      and things preying on his mind; he 's not a bad man really. Sometimes\n      he'll speak quite kind to me, but I've stood so much from him, I don't\n      feel it in me to speak kind back, but just keep myself to myself. And he's\n      all right with the children too, except when he's not himself.",
                "WHEELER. You mean when he's drunk, the beauty.",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes. [Without change of voice] There's the young gentleman\n      asleep on the sofa.",
                "[They both look silently at Jack.]",
                "MRS. JONES. [At last, in her soft voice.] He does n't look quite himself.",
                "WHEELER. He's a young limb, that's what he is. It 's my belief he was\n      tipsy last night, like your husband. It 's another kind of bein' out of\n      work that sets him to drink. I 'll go and tell Marlow. This is his job.",
                "[She goes.] [Mrs. Jones, upon her knees, begins a gentle sweeping.]",
                "JACK. [Waking.] Who's there? What is it?",
                "MRS. JONES. It's me, sir, Mrs. Jones.",
                "JACK. [Sitting up and looking round.] Where is it -- what -- what\n      time is it?",
                "MRS. JONES. It's getting on for nine o'clock, sir.",
                "JACK. For nine! Why -- what! [Rising, and loosening his tongue; putting\n      hands to his head, and staring hard at Mrs. Jones.] Look here, you, Mrs. --  -- Mrs.\n      Jones -- don't you say you caught me asleep here.",
                "MRS. JONES. No, sir, of course I won't sir.",
                "JACK. It's quite an accident; I don't know how it happened. I must have\n      forgotten to go to bed. It's a queer thing. I 've got a most beastly\n      headache. Mind you don't say anything, Mrs. Jones.",
                "[Goes out and passes MARLOW in the doorway. MARLOW is young and quiet;\n        he is cleanshaven, and his hair is brushed high from his forehead in a\n        coxcomb. Incidentally a butler, he is first a man. He looks at MRS.\n        JONES, and smiles a private smile.]",
                "MARLOW. Not the first time, and won't be the last. Looked a bit dicky, eh,\n      Mrs. Jones?",
                "MRS. JONES. He did n't look quite himself. Of course I did n't take\n      notice.",
                "MARLOW. You're used to them. How's your old man?",
                "MRS. JONES. [Softly as throughout.] Well, he was very bad last night; he\n      did n't seem to know what he was about. He was very late, and he was most\n      abusive. But now, of course, he's asleep.",
                "MARLOW. That's his way of finding a job, eh?",
                "MRS. JONES. As a rule, Mr. Marlow, he goes out early every morning looking\n      for work, and sometimes he comes in fit to drop -- and of course I\n      can't say he does n't try to get it, because he does. Trade's very bad.\n      [She stands quite still, her fan and brush before her, at the beginning\n      and the end of long vistas of experience, traversing them with her\n      impersonal eye.] But he's not a good husband to me -- last night he hit\n      me, and he was so dreadfully abusive.",
                "MARLOW. Bank 'oliday, eh! He 's too fond of the \"Goat and Bells,\" that's\n      what's the matter with him. I see him at the corner late every night. He\n      hangs about.",
                "MRS. JONES. He gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work,\n      and being refused so often, and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to\n      his head. But he shouldn't treat his wife as he treats me. Sometimes I 've\n      had to go and walk about at night, when he wouldn't let me stay in the\n      room; but he's sorry for it afterwards. And he hangs about after me, he\n      waits for me in the street; and I don't think he ought to, because I 've\n      always been a good wife to him. And I tell him Mrs. Barthwick wouldn't\n      like him coming about the place. But that only makes him angry, and he\n      says dreadful things about the gentry. Of course it was through me that he\n      first lost his place, through his not treating me right; and that's made\n      him bitter against the gentry. He had a very good place as groom in the\n      country; but it made such a stir, because of course he did n't treat me\n      right.",
                "MARLOW. Got the sack?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes; his employer said he couldn't keep him, because there was\n      a great deal of talk; and he said it was such a bad example. But it's very\n      important for me to keep my work here; I have the three children, and I\n      don't want him to come about after me in the streets, and make a\n      disturbance as he sometimes does.",
                "MARLOW. [Holding up the empty decanter.] Not a drain! Next time he hits\n      you get a witness and go down to the court --  --",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, I think I 've made up my mind. I think I ought to.",
                "MARLOW. That's right. Where's the ciga --  -- ?",
                "[He searches for the silver box; he looks at MRS. JONES, who is sweeping\n        on her hands and knees; he checks himself and stands reflecting. From\n        the tray he picks two half-smoked cigarettes, and reads the name on\n        them.]",
                "Nestor -- where the deuce --  -- ?",
                "[With a meditative air he looks again at MRS. JONES, and, taking up\n        JACK'S overcoat, he searches in the pockets. WHEELER, with a tray of\n        breakfast things, comes in.]",
                "MARLOW. [Aside to WHEELER.] Have you seen the cigarette-box?",
                "WHEELER. No.",
                "MARLOW. Well, it's gone. I put it on the tray last night. And he's been\n      smoking. [Showing her the ends of cigarettes.] It's not in these pockets.\n      He can't have taken it upstairs this morning! Have a good look in his room\n      when he comes down. Who's been in here?",
                "WHEELER. Only me and Mrs. Jones.",
                "MRS. JONES. I 've finished here; shall I do the drawing-room now?",
                "WHEELER. [Looking at her doubtfully.] Have you seen --  -- Better do\n      the boudwower first.",
                "[MRS. JONES goes out with pan and brush. MARLOW and WHEELER look each\n        other in the face.]",
                "MARLOW. It'll turn up.",
                "WHEELER. [Hesitating.] You don't think she --  --  [Nodding at the\n      door.]",
                "MARLOW. [Stoutly.] I don't --  -- I never believes anything of\n      anybody.",
                "WHEELER. But the master'll have to be told.",
                "MARLOW. You wait a bit, and see if it don't turn up. Suspicion's no\n      business of ours. I set my mind against it.",
                "The curtain falls.",
                "The curtain rises again at once.",
                "SCENE III",
                "BARTHWICK and MRS. BARTHWICK are seated at the breakfast table. He is a\n        man between fifty and sixty; quietly important, with a bald forehead,\n        and pince-nez, and the \"Times\" in his hand. She is a lady of nearly\n        fifty, well dressed, with greyish hair, good features, and a decided\n        manner. They face each other.",
                "BARTHWICK. [From behind his paper.] The Labour man has got in at the\n      by-election for Barnside, my dear.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Another Labour? I can't think what on earth the country is\n      about.",
                "BARTHWICK. I predicted it. It's not a matter of vast importance.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Not? How can you take it so calmly, John? To me it's\n      simply outrageous. And there you sit, you Liberals, and pretend to\n      encourage these people!",
                "BARTHWICK. [Frowning.] The representation of all parties is necessary for\n      any proper reform, for any proper social policy.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. I've no patience with your talk of reform -- all that\n      nonsense about social policy. We know perfectly well what it is they want;\n      they want things for themselves. Those Socialists and Labour men are an\n      absolutely selfish set of people. They have no sense of patriotism, like\n      the upper classes; they simply want what we've got.",
                "BARTHWICK. Want what we've got! [He stares into space.] My dear, what are\n      you talking about? [With a contortion.] I 'm no alarmist.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Cream? Quite uneducated men! Wait until they begin to tax\n      our investments. I 'm convinced that when they once get a chance they will\n      tax everything -- they 've no feeling for the country. You Liberals and\n      Conservatives, you 're all alike; you don't see an inch before your noses.\n      You've no imagination, not a scrap of imagination between you. You ought\n      to join hands and nip it in the bud.",
                "BARTHWICK. You 're talking nonsense! How is it possible for Liberals and\n      Conservatives to join hands, as you call it? That shows how absurd it is\n      for women --  -- Why, the very essence of a Liberal is to trust in\n      the people!",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Now, John, eat your breakfast. As if there were any real\n      difference between you and the Conservatives. All the upper classes have\n      the same interests to protect, and the same principles. [Calmly.] Oh!\n      you're sitting upon a volcano, John.",
                "BARTHWICK. What!",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. I read a letter in the paper yesterday. I forget the man's\n      name, but it made the whole thing perfectly clear. You don't look things\n      in the face.",
                "BARTHWICK. Indeed! [Heavily.] I am a Liberal! Drop the subject, please!",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Toast? I quite agree with what this man says: Education is\n      simply ruining the lower classes. It unsettles them, and that's the worst\n      thing for us all. I see an enormous difference in the manner of servants.",
                "BARTHWICK, [With suspicious emphasis.] I welcome any change that will lead\n      to something better. [He opens a letter.] H'm! This is that affair of\n      Master Jack's again. \"High Street, Oxford. Sir, We have received Mr. John\n      Barthwick, Senior's, draft for forty pounds!\" Oh! the letter's to him! \"We\n      now enclose the cheque you cashed with us, which, as we stated in our\n      previous letter, was not met on presentation at your bank. We are, Sir,\n      yours obediently, Moss and Sons, Tailors.\" H 'm! [Staring at the cheque.]\n      A pretty business altogether! The boy might have been prosecuted.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Come, John, you know Jack did n't mean anything; he only\n      thought he was overdrawing. I still think his bank ought to have cashed\n      that cheque. They must know your position.",
                "BARTHWICK. [Replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque.] Much\n      good that would have done him in a court of law.",
                "[He stops as JACK comes in, fastening his waistcoat and staunching a\n        razor cut upon his chin.]",
                "JACK. [Sitting down between them, and speaking with an artificial\n      joviality.] Sorry I 'm late. [He looks lugubriously at the dishes.] Tea,\n      please, mother. Any letters for me? [BARTHWICK hands the letter to him.]\n      But look here, I say, this has been opened! I do wish you would n't --  --",
                "BARTHWICK. [Touching the envelope.] I suppose I 'm entitled to this name.",
                "JACK. [Sulkily.] Well, I can't help having your name, father! [He reads\n      the letter, and mutters.] Brutes!",
                "BARTHWICK. [Eyeing him.] You don't deserve to be so well out of that.",
                "JACK. Haven't you ragged me enough, dad?",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. Yes, John, let Jack have his breakfast.",
                "BARTHWICK. If you hadn't had me to come to, where would you have been?\n      It's the merest accident -- suppose you had been the son of a poor man\n      or a clerk. Obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not\n      meet. It might have ruined you for life. I can't see what's to become of\n      you if these are your principles. I never did anything of the sort myself.",
                "JACK. I expect you always had lots of money. If you've got plenty of\n      money, of course --  --",
                "BARTHWICK. On the contrary, I had not your advantages. My father kept me\n      very short of money.",
                "JACK. How much had you, dad?",

                "BARTHWICK. And I suppose he takes all your money?",
                "MRS. JONES. No, sir, he's very good about my money, except when he's not\n      himself, and then, of course, he treats me very badly.",
                "BARTHWICK. Now what is he -- your husband?",
                "MRS. JONES. By profession, sir, of course he's a groom.",
                "BARTHWICK. A groom! How came he to lose his place?",
                "MRS. JONES. He lost his place a long time ago, sir, and he's never had a\n      very long job since; and now, of course, the motor-cars are against him.",
                "BARTHWICK. When were you married to him, Mrs. Jones?",
                "MRS. JONES. Eight years ago, sir that was in --  --",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. [Sharply.] Eight? You said the eldest child was nine.",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, ma'am; of course that was why he lost his place. He did\n      n't treat me rightly, and of course his employer said he couldn't keep him\n      because of the example.",
                "BARTHWICK. You mean he -- ahem --  --",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir; and of course after he lost his place he married me.",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. You actually mean to say you -- you were --  --",
                "BARTHWICK. My dear --  --",
                "MRS. BARTHWICK. [Indignantly.] How disgraceful!",
                "BARTHWICK. [Hurriedly.] And where are you living now, Mrs. Jones?",
                "MRS. JONES. We've not got a home, sir. Of course we've been obliged to put\n      away most of our things.",
                "BARTHWICK. Put your things away! You mean to -- to -- er -- to\n      pawn them?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, to put them away. We're living in Merthyr Street -- that\n      is close by here, sir -- at No. 34. We just have the one room.",
                "BARTHWICK. And what do you pay a week?",
                "MRS. JONES. We pay six shillings a week, sir, for a furnished room.",
                "BARTHWICK. And I suppose you're behind in the rent?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, we're a little behind in the rent.",
                "BARTHWICK. But you're in good work, aren't you?",
                "MRS. JONES. Well, Sir, I have a day in Stamford Place Thursdays. And\n      Mondays and Wednesdays and Fridays I come here. But to-day, of course, is\n      a half-day, because of yesterday's Bank Holiday.",
                "BARTHWICK. I see; four days a week, and you get half a crown a day, is\n      that it?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, and my dinner; but sometimes it's only half a day,\n      and that's eighteen pence.",
                "BARTHWICK. And when your husband earns anything he spends it in drink, I\n      suppose?",
                "MRS. JONES. Sometimes he does, sir, and sometimes he gives it to me for\n      the children. Of course he would work if he could get it, sir, but it\n      seems there are a great many people out of work.",
                "BARTHWICK. Ah! Yes. We -- er -- won't go into that.\n      [Sympathetically.] And how about your work here? Do you find it hard?",
                "MRS. JONES. Oh! no, sir, not very hard, sir; except of course, when I\n      don't get my sleep at night.",
                "BARTHWICK. Ah! And you help do all the rooms? And sometimes, I suppose,\n      you go out for cook?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir.",
                "BARTHWICK. And you 've been out this morning?",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, of course I had to go to the greengrocer's.",
                "BARTHWICK. Exactly. So your husband earns nothing? And he's a bad\n      character.",
                "MRS. JONES. No, Sir, I don't say that, sir. I think there's a great deal\n      of good in him; though he does treat me very bad sometimes. And of course\n      I don't like to leave him, but I think I ought to, because really I hardly\n      know how to stay with him. He often raises his hand to me. Not long ago he\n      gave me a blow here [touches her breast] and I can feel it now. So I think\n      I ought to leave him, don't you, sir?",
                "BARTHWICK. Ah! I can't help you there. It's a very serious thing to leave\n      your husband. Very serious thing.",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, of course I 'm afraid of what he might do to me if I\n      were to leave him; he can be so very violent.",
                "BARTHWICK. H'm! Well, that I can't pretend to say anything about. It's the\n      bad principle I'm speaking of --  --",
                "MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir; I know nobody can help me. I know I must decide for\n      myself, and of course I know that he has a very hard life. And he's fond\n      of the children, and its very hard for him to see them going without food.",
                "BARTHWICK. [Hastily.] Well -- er -- thank you, I just wanted to hear\n      about you. I don't think I need detain you any longer, Mrs. Jones.",
                "MRS. JONES. No, sir, thank you, sir.",
                "BARTHWICK. Good morning, then.",
                "MRS. JONES. Good morning, sir; good morning, ma'am.",
                "BARTHWICK. [Exchanging glances with his wife.] By the way, Mrs. Jones -- I\n      think it is only fair to tell you, a silver cigarette-box  -- er -- is\n      missing.",
                "MRS. JONES. [Looking from one face to the other.] I am very sorry, sir.",
                "BARTHWICK. Yes; you have not seen it, I suppose?",
                "MRS. JONES. [Realising that suspicion is upon her; with an uneasy\n      movement.] Where was it, sir; if you please, sir?",
                "BARTHWICK. [Evasively.] Where did Marlow say? Er -- in this room, yes,\n      in this room.",
                "MRS. JONES. No, Sir, I have n't seen it -- of course if I 'd seen it I\n      should have noticed it.",
                "BARTHWICK. [Giving hey a rapid glance.] You -- you are sure of that?",
                "MRS. JONES. [Impassively.] Yes, Sir. [With a slow nodding of her head.] I\n      have not seen it, and of course I don't know where it is.",
                "[She turns and goes quietly out.]",
                "BARTHWICK. H'm!",
                "[The three BARTHWICKS avoid each other's glances.]",

                "The JONES's lodgings, Merthyr Street, at half-past two o'clock. The bare\n        room, with tattered oilcloth and damp, distempered walls, has an air of\n        tidy wretchedness. On the bed lies JONES, half-dressed; his coat is\n        thrown across his feet, and muddy boots are lying on the floor close by.\n        He is asleep. The door is opened and MRS. JONES comes in, dressed in a\n        pinched black jacket and old black sailor hat; she carries a parcel\n        wrapped up in the \"Times.\" She puts her parcel down, unwraps an apron,\n        half a loaf, two onions, three potatoes, and a tiny piece of bacon.\n        Taking a teapot from the cupboard, she rinses it, shakes into it some\n        powdered tea out of a screw of paper, puts it on the hearth, and sitting\n        in a wooden chair quietly begins to cry.",
                "JONES. [Stirring and yawning.] That you? What's the time?",
                "MRS. JONES. [Drying her eyes, and in her usual voice.] Half-past two.",
                "JONES. What you back so soon for?",
                "MRS. JONES. I only had the half day to-day, Jem.",
                "JONES. [On his back, and in a drowsy voice.] Got anything for dinner?",
                "MRS. JONES. Mrs. BARTHWICK's cook gave me a little bit of bacon. I'm going\n      to make a stew. [She prepares for cooking.] There's fourteen shillings\n      owing for rent, James, and of course I 've only got two and fourpence.\n      They'll be coming for it to-day.",
                "JONES. [Turning towards her on his elbow.] Let 'em come and find my\n      surprise packet. I've had enough o' this tryin' for work. Why should I go\n      round and round after a job like a bloomin' squirrel in a cage. \"Give us a\n      job, sir\" -- \"Take a man on\" -- \"Got a wife and three children.\"\n      Sick of it I am! I 'd sooner lie here and rot. \"Jones, you come and join\n      the demonstration; come and 'old a flag, and listen to the ruddy orators,\n      and go 'ome as empty as you came.\" There's some that seems to like that -- the\n      sheep! When I go seekin' for a job now, and see the brutes lookin' me up\n      an' down, it's like a thousand serpents in me. I 'm not arskin' for any\n      treat. A man wants to sweat hisself silly and not allowed that's a rum\n      start, ain't it? A man wants to sweat his soul out to keep the breath in\n      him and ain't allowed -- that's justice that's freedom and all the rest\n      of it! [He turns his face towards the wall.] You're so milky mild; you\n      don't know what goes on inside o' me. I'm done with the silly game. If\n      they want me, let 'em come for me!",
                "[MRS. JONES stops cooking and stands unmoving at the table.]",
                "I've tried and done with it, I tell you. I've never been afraid of what 's\n      before me. You mark my words -- if you think they've broke my spirit,\n      you're mistook. I 'll lie and rot sooner than arsk 'em again. What makes\n      you stand like that -- you long-sufferin', Gawd-forsaken image -- that's\n      why I can't keep my hands off you. So now you know. Work! You can work,\n      but you have n't the spirit of a louse!",
                "MRS. JONES. [Quietly.] You talk more wild sometimes when you're yourself,\n      James, than when you 're not. If you don't get work, how are we to go on?\n      They won't let us stay here; they're looking to their money to-day, I\n      know.",
                "JONES. I see this BARTHWICK o' yours every day goin' down to Pawlyment\n      snug and comfortable to talk his silly soul out; an' I see that young\n      calf, his son, swellin' it about, and goin' on the razzle-dazzle. Wot 'ave\n      they done that makes 'em any better than wot I am? They never did a day's\n      work in their lives. I see 'em day after day.",
                "MRS. JONES. And I wish you wouldn't come after me like that, and hang\n      about the house. You don't seem able to keep away at all, and whatever you\n      do it for I can't think, because of course they notice it.",
                "JONES. I suppose I may go where I like. Where may I go? The other day I\n      went to a place in the Edgware Road. \"Gov'nor,\" I says to the boss, \"take\n      me on,\" I says. \"I 'aven't done a stroke o' work not these two months; it\n      takes the heart out of a man,\" I says; \"I 'm one to work; I 'm not afraid\n      of anything you can give me!\" \"My good man,\" 'e says, \"I 've had thirty of\n      you here this morning. I took the first two,\" he says, \"and that's all I\n      want.\" \"Thank you, then rot the world!\" I says. \"Blasphemin',\" he says,\n      \"is not the way to get a job. Out you go, my lad!\" [He laughs\n      sardonically.] Don't you raise your voice because you're starvin'; don't\n      yer even think of it; take it lyin' down! Take it like a sensible man,\n      carn't you? And a little way down the street a lady says to me: [Pinching\n      his voice] \"D' you want to earn a few pence, my man?\" and gives me her dog\n      to 'old outside a shop-fat as a butler 'e was -- tons o' meat had gone\n      to the makin' of him. It did 'er good, it did, made 'er feel 'erself that\n      charitable, but I see 'er lookin' at the copper standin' alongside o' me,\n      for fear I should make off with 'er bloomin' fat dog. [He sits on the edge\n      of the bed and puts a boot on. Then looking up.] What's in that head o'\n      yours? [Almost pathetically.] Carn't you speak for once?",
                "[There is a knock, and MRS. SEDDON, the landlady, appears, an anxious,\n        harassed, shabby woman in working clothes.]",
                "MRS. SEDDON. I thought I 'eard you come in, Mrs. Jones. I 've spoke to my\n      'usband, but he says he really can't afford to wait another day.",
                "JONES. [With scowling jocularity.] Never you mind what your 'usband says,\n      you go your own way like a proper independent woman. Here, jenny, chuck\n      her that.",
                "[Producing a sovereign from his trousers pocket, he throws it to his\n        wife, who catches it in her apron with a gasp. JONES resumes the lacing\n        of his boots.]",
                "MRS. JONES. [Rubbing the sovereign stealthily.] I'm very sorry we're so\n      late with it, and of course it's fourteen shillings, so if you've got six\n      that will be right.",
                "[MRS. SEDDON takes the sovereign and fumbles for the change.]",
                "JONES. [With his eyes fixed on his boots.] Bit of a surprise for yer,\n      ain't it?",
                "MRS. SEDDON. Thank you, and I'm sure I'm very much obliged. [She does\n      indeed appear surprised.] I 'll bring you the change.",
                "JONES. [Mockingly.] Don't mention it.",
                "MRS. SEDDON. Thank you, and I'm sure I'm very much obliged. [She slides\n      away.]",
                "[MRS. JONES gazes at JONES who is still lacing up his boots.]",
                "JONES. I 've had a bit of luck. [Pulling out the crimson purse and some\n      loose coins.] Picked up a purse -- seven pound and more.",
                "MRS. JONES. Oh, James!",
                "JONES. Oh, James! What about Oh, James! I picked it up I tell you. This is\n      lost property, this is!",
                "MRS. JONES. But is n't there a name in it, or something?",
                "JONES. Name? No, there ain't no name. This don't belong to such as 'ave\n      visitin' cards. This belongs to a perfec' lidy. Tike an' smell it. [He\n      pitches her the purse, which she puts gently to her nose.] Now, you tell\n      me what I ought to have done. You tell me that. You can always tell me\n      what I ought to ha' done, can't yer?",
                "MRS. JONES. [Laying down the purse.] I can't say what you ought to have\n      done, James. Of course the money was n't yours; you've taken somebody\n      else's money.",
                "JONES. Finding's keeping. I 'll take it as wages for the time I 've gone\n      about the streets asking for what's my rights. I'll take it for what's\n      overdue, d' ye hear? [With strange triumph.] I've got money in my pocket,\n      my girl.",
                "[MRS. JONES goes on again with the preparation of the meal, JONES\n        looking at her furtively.]",
                "Money in my pocket! And I 'm not goin' to waste it. With this 'ere money\n      I'm goin' to Canada. I'll let you have a pound.",
                "[A silence.]",
                "You've often talked of leavin' me. You 've often told me I treat you badly -- well\n      I 'ope you 'll be glad when I 'm gone.",
                "MRS. JONES. [Impassively.] You have, treated me very badly, James, and of\n      course I can't prevent your going; but I can't tell whether I shall be\n      glad when you're gone.",
                "JONES. It'll change my luck. I 've 'ad nothing but bad luck since I first\n      took up with you. [More softly.] And you've 'ad no bloomin' picnic.",
                "MRS. JONES. Of course it would have been better for us if we had never\n      met. We were n't meant for each other. But you're set against me, that's\n      what you are, and you have been for a long time. And you treat me so\n      badly, James, going after that Rosie and all. You don't ever seem to think\n      of the children that I 've had to bring into the world, and of all the\n      trouble I 've had to keep them, and what 'll become of them when you're\n      gone.",
                "JONES. [Crossing the room gloomily.] If you think I want to leave the\n      little beggars you're bloomin' well mistaken.",
                "MRS. JONES. Of course I know you're fond of them.",
                "JONES. [Fingering the purse, half angrily.] Well, then, you stow it, old\n      girl. The kids 'll get along better with you than when I 'm here. If I 'd\n      ha' known as much as I do now, I 'd never ha' had one o' them. What's the\n      use o' bringin' 'em into a state o' things like this? It's a crime, that's\n      what it is; but you find it out too late; that's what's the matter with\n      this 'ere world.",
                "[He puts the purse back in his pocket.]",
                "MRS. JONES. Of course it would have been better for them, poor little\n      things; but they're your own children, and I wonder at you talkin' like\n      that. I should miss them dreadfully if I was to lose them.",
                "JONES. [Sullenly.] An' you ain't the only one. If I make money out there -- [Looking\n      up, he sees her shaking out his coat -- in a changed voice.] Leave that\n      coat alone!",
                "[The silver box drops from the pocket, scattering the cigarettes upon\n        the bed. Taking up the box she stares at it; he rushes at her and\n        snatches the box away.]",

                "JONES. [Dropping the box onto the table.] You mind what you're sayin'!\n      When I go out I 'll take and chuck it in the water along with that there\n      purse. I 'ad it when I was in liquor, and for what you do when you 're in\n      liquor you're not responsible-and that's Gawd's truth as you ought to\n      know. I don't want the thing -- I won't have it. I took it out o'\n      spite. I 'm no thief, I tell you; and don't you call me one, or it'll be\n      the worse for you.",
                "MRS. JONES. [Twisting her apron strings.] It's Mr. Barthwick's! You've\n      taken away my reputation. Oh, Jem, whatever made you?",
                "JONES. What d' you mean?",
                "MRS. JONES. It's been missed; they think it's me. Oh! whatever made you do\n      it, Jem?",
                "JONES. I tell you I was in liquor. I don't want it; what's the good of it\n      to me? If I were to pawn it they'd only nab me. I 'm no thief. I 'm no\n      worse than wot that young Barthwick is; he brought 'ome that purse that I\n      picked up -- a lady's purse -- 'ad it off 'er in a row, kept sayin'\n      'e 'd scored 'er off. Well, I scored 'im off. Tight as an owl 'e was! And\n      d' you think anything'll happen to him?",

                "JONES. Is it then? I'll make it hot for 'em yet. What about that purse?\n      What about young BARTHWICK?",
                "[MRS. JONES comes forward to the table and tries to take the box; JONES\n      prevents her.] What do you want with that? You drop it, I say!",

                "MRS. JONES. [In her quiet voice, still out of breath, her hand upon her\n      breast.] Of course I did not take it, sir. I never have taken anything\n      that did n't belong to me; and of course I know nothing about it.",
                "SNOW. You were at the house this morning; you did the room in which the\n      box was left; you were alone in the room. I find the box 'ere. You say you\n      did n't take it?",

And of course, your Worship, he had had very\n      little to eat all day, and the drink does go to the head when you have not\n      had enough to eat. Your Worship may not know, but it is the truth.

                "MAGISTRATE. [Staring at the purse.] Yes, yes -- let me see [There is a\n      silence.] No, no, I 've nothing before me as to the purse. How did you\n      come by all that money?",
                "JONES. [After a long pause, suddenly.] I declines to say.",
                "MAGISTRATE. But if you had all that money, what made you take this box?",

                "JONES. If you had my life, if you'd been out of work --  --",

                "MAGISTRATE. But I say it was. What made you strike the officer a blow?",
                "JONES. Any man would a struck 'im a blow. I'd strike 'im again, I would.",
                "MAGISTRATE. You are not making your case any better by violence. How do\n      you suppose we could get on if everybody behaved like you?",

                "MRS. JONES. Your Worship, it's the children that's preying on his mind,\n      because of course I 've lost my work. And I've had to find another room\n      owing to the scandal.",
                "MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, I know -- but if he had n't acted like this\n      nobody would have suffered.",
                "JONES. [Glaring round at JACK.] I 've done no worse than wot 'e 'as. Wot I\n      want to know is wot 's goin' to be done to 'im.",

JONES, who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on the rail.] It is\n      very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved as he has. It is not\n      the consequences to him but the consequences to you. You have been brought\n      here twice, you have lost your work --  [He glares at JONES] -- and\n      this is what always happens. Now you may go away, and I am very sorry it\n      was necessary to bring you here at all.",
