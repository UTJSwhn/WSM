                "THE FIRST AND LAST",
                "\"So the last shall be first, and the first last.\" -- HOLY WRIT.",
                "It was a dark room at that hour of six in the evening, when just the\n      single oil reading-lamp under its green shade let fall a dapple of light\n      over the Turkey carpet; over the covers of books taken out of the\n      bookshelves, and the open pages of the one selected; over the deep blue\n      and gold of the coffee service on the little old stool with its Oriental\n      embroidery. Very dark in the winter, with drawn curtains, many rows of\n      leather-bound volumes, oak-panelled walls and ceiling. So large, too, that\n      the lighted spot before the fire where he sat was just an oasis. But that\n      was what Keith Darrant liked, after his day's work -- the hard early\n      morning study of his \"cases,\" the fret and strain of the day in court; it\n      was his rest, these two hours before dinner, with books, coffee, a pipe,\n      and sometimes a nap. In red Turkish slippers and his old brown velvet\n      coat, he was well suited to that framing of glow and darkness. A painter\n      would have seized avidly on his clear-cut, yellowish face, with its black\n      eyebrows twisting up over eyes -- grey or brown, one could hardly tell,\n      and its dark grizzling hair still plentiful, in spite of those daily hours\n      of wig. He seldom thought of his work while he sat there, throwing off\n      with practised ease the strain of that long attention to the multiple\n      threads of argument and evidence to be disentangled -- work profoundly\n      interesting, as a rule, to his clear intellect, trained to almost\n      instinctive rejection of all but the essential, to selection of what was\n      legally vital out of the mass of confused tactical and human detail\n      presented to his scrutiny; yet sometimes tedious and wearing. As for\n      instance to-day, when he had suspected his client of perjury, and was\n      almost convinced that he must throw up his brief. He had disliked the\n      weak-looking, white-faced fellow from the first, and his nervous, shifty\n      answers, his prominent startled eyes -- a type too common in these days\n      of canting tolerations and weak humanitarianism; no good, no good!",
                "Of the three books he had taken down, a Volume of Voltaire -- curious\n      fascination that Frenchman had, for all his destructive irony! -- a\n      volume of Burton's travels, and Stevenson's \"New Arabian Nights,\" he had\n      pitched upon the last. He felt, that evening, the want of something\n      sedative, a desire to rest from thought of any kind. The court had been\n      crowded, stuffy; the air, as he walked home, soft, sou'-westerly, charged\n      with coming moisture, no quality of vigour in it; he felt relaxed, tired,\n      even nervy, and for once the loneliness of his house seemed strange and\n      comfortless.",
                "Lowering the lamp, he turned his face towards the fire. Perhaps he would\n      get a sleep before that boring dinner at the Tellasson's. He wished it\n      were vacation, and Maisie back from school. A widower for many years, he\n      had lost the habit of a woman about him; yet to-night he had a positive\n      yearning for the society of his young daughter, with her quick ways, and\n      bright, dark eyes. Curious what perpetual need of a woman some men had!\n      His brother Laurence -- wasted -- all through women -- atrophy of\n      willpower! A man on the edge of things; living from hand to mouth; his\n      gifts all down at heel! One would have thought the Scottish strain might\n      have saved him; and yet, when a Scotsman did begin to go downhill, who\n      could go faster? Curious that their mother's blood should have worked so\n      differently in her two sons. He himself had always felt he owed all his\n      success to it.",
                "His thoughts went off at a tangent to a certain issue troubling his legal\n      conscience. He had not wavered in the usual assumption of omniscience, but\n      he was by no means sure that he had given right advice. Well! Without that\n      power to decide and hold to decision in spite of misgiving, one would\n      never have been fit for one's position at the Bar, never have been fit for\n      anything. The longer he lived, the more certain he became of the prime\n      necessity of virile and decisive action in all the affairs of life. A word\n      and a blow -- and the blow first! Doubts, hesitations, sentiment the\n      muling and puking of this twilight age -- ! And there welled up on his\n      handsome face a smile that was almost devilish -- the tricks of\n      firelight are so many! It faded again in sheer drowsiness; he slept....",
                "He woke with a start, having a feeling of something out beyond the light,\n      and without turning his head said: \"What's that?\" There came a sound as if\n      somebody had caught his breath. He turned up the lamp.",
                "\"Who's there?\"",
                "A voice over by the door answered:",
                "\"Only I -- Larry.\"",
                "Something in the tone, or perhaps just being startled out of sleep like\n      this, made him shiver. He said:",
                "\"I was asleep. Come in!\"",
                "It was noticeable that he did not get up, or even turn his head, now that\n      he knew who it was, but waited, his half-closed eyes fixed on the fire,\n      for his brother to come forward. A visit from Laurence was not an unmixed\n      blessing. He could hear him breathing, and became conscious of a scent of\n      whisky. Why could not the fellow at least abstain when he was coming here!\n      It was so childish, so lacking in any sense of proportion or of decency!\n      And he said sharply:",
                "\"Well, Larry, what is it?\"",
                "It was always something. He often wondered at the strength of that sense\n      of trusteeship, which kept him still tolerant of the troubles, amenable to\n      the petitions of this brother of his; or was it just \"blood\" feeling, a\n      Highland sense of loyalty to kith and kin; an old-time quality which\n      judgment and half his instincts told him was weakness but which, in spite\n      of all, bound him to the distressful fellow? Was he drunk now, that he\n      kept lurking out there by the door? And he said less sharply:",
                "\"Why don't you come and sit down?\"",
                "He was coming now, avoiding the light, skirting along the walls just\n      beyond the radiance of the lamp, his feet and legs to the waist brightly\n      lighted, but his face disintegrated in shadow, like the face of a dark\n      ghost.",
                "\"Are you ill, man?\"",
                "Still no answer, save a shake of that head, and the passing up of a hand,\n      out of the light, to the ghostly forehead under the dishevelled hair. The\n      scent of whisky was stronger now; and Keith thought:",
                "'He really is drunk. Nice thing for the new butler to see! If he can't\n      behave -- '",
                "The figure against the wall heaved a sigh -- so truly from an\n      overburdened heart that Keith was conscious with a certain dismay of not\n      having yet fathomed the cause of this uncanny silence. He got up, and,\n      back to the fire, said with a brutality born of nerves rather than design:",
                "\"What is it, man? Have you committed a murder, that you stand there dumb\n      as a fish?\"",
                "For a second no answer at all, not even of breathing; then, just the\n      whisper:",
                "\"Yes.\"",
                "The sense of unreality which so helps one at moments of disaster enabled\n      Keith to say vigorously:",
                "\"By Jove! You have been drinking!\"",
                "But it passed at once into deadly apprehension.",
                "\"What do you mean? Come here, where I can see you. What's the matter with\n      you, Larry?\"",
                "With a sudden lurch and dive, his brother left the shelter of the shadow,\n      and sank into a chair in the circle of light. And another long, broken\n      sigh escaped him.",
                "\"There's nothing the matter with me, Keith! It's true!\"",
                "Keith stepped quickly forward, and stared down into his brother's face;\n      and instantly he saw that it was true. No one could have simulated the\n      look in those eyes -- of horrified wonder, as if they would never again\n      get on terms with the face to which they belonged. To see them squeezed\n      the heart-only real misery could look like that. Then that sudden pity\n      became angry bewilderment.",
                "\"What in God's name is this nonsense?\"",
                "But it was significant that he lowered his voice; went over to the door,\n      too, to see if it were shut. Laurence had drawn his chair forward,\n      huddling over the fire -- a thin figure, a worn, high-cheekboned face\n      with deep-sunk blue eyes, and wavy hair all ruffled, a face that still had\n      a certain beauty. Putting a hand on that lean shoulder, Keith said:",
                "\"Come, Larry! Pull yourself together, and drop exaggeration.\"",
                "\"It's true; I tell you; I've killed a man.\"",
                "The noisy violence of that outburst acted like a douche. What was the\n      fellow about -- shouting out such words! But suddenly Laurence lifted\n      his hands and wrung them. The gesture was so utterly painful that it drew\n      a quiver from Keith's face.",
                "\"Why did you come here,\" he said, \"and tell me this?\"",
                "Larry's face was really unearthly sometimes, such strange gleams passed up\n      on to it!",
                "\"Whom else should I tell? I came to know what I'm to do, Keith? Give\n      myself up, or what?\"",
                "At that sudden introduction of the practical Keith felt his heart twitch.\n      Was it then as real as all that? But he said, very quietly:",
                "\"Just tell me -- How did it come about, this -- affair?\"",
                "That question linked the dark, gruesome, fantastic nightmare on to\n      actuality.",
                "\"When did it happen?\"",
                "\"Last night.\"",
                "In Larry's face there was -- there had always been -- something\n      childishly truthful. He would never stand a chance in court! And Keith\n      said:",
                "\"How? Where? You'd better tell me quietly from the beginning. Drink this\n      coffee; it'll clear your head.\"",
                "Laurence took the little blue cup and drained it.",
                "\"Yes,\" he said. \"It's like this, Keith. There's a girl I've known for some\n      months now -- \"",
                "Women! And Keith said between his teeth: \"Well?\"",
                "\"Her father was a Pole who died over here when she was sixteen, and left\n      her all alone. A man called Walenn, a mongrel American, living in the same\n      house, married her, or pretended to -- she's very pretty, Keith -- he\n      left her with a baby six months old, and another coming. That one died,\n      and she did nearly. Then she starved till another fellow took her on. She\n      lived with him two years; then Walenn turned up again, and made her go\n      back to him. The brute used to beat her black and blue, all for nothing.\n      Then he left her again. When I met her she'd lost her elder child, too,\n      and was taking anybody who came along.\"",
                "He suddenly looked up into Keith's face.",
                "\"But I've never met a sweeter woman, nor a truer, that I swear. Woman!\n      She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that brute -- that\n      Walenn -- had found her out again; and when he came for me, swaggering\n      and bullying -- Look!\" -- he touched a dark mark on his forehead -- \"I\n      took his throat in my hands, and when I let go -- \"",
                "\"Yes?\"",
                "\"Dead. I never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him\n      behind.\"",
                "Again he made that gesture-wringing his hands.",
                "In a hard voice Keith said:",
                "\"What did you do then?\"",
                "\"We sat by it a long time. Then I carried it on my back down the street,\n      round a corner to an archway.\"",
                "\"How far?\"",
                "\"About fifty yards.\"",
                "\"Was anyone -- did anyone see?\"",
                "\"No.\"",
                "\"What time?\"",
                "\"Three.\"",
                "\"And then?\"",
                "\"Went back to her.\"",
                "\"Why -- in Heaven's name?\"",
                "\"She was lonely and afraid; so was I, Keith.\"",
                "\"Where is this place?\"",
                "\"Forty-two, Borrow Street, Soho.\"",
                "\"And the archway?\"",
                "\"Corner of Glove Lane.\"",
                "\"Good God! Why -- I saw it in the paper!\"",
                "And seizing the journal that lay on his bureau, Keith read again that\n      paragraph: \"The body of a man was found this morning under an archway in\n      Glove Lane, Soho. From marks about the throat grave suspicions of foul\n      play are entertained. The body had apparently been robbed, and nothing was\n      discovered leading to identification.\"",
                "It was real earnest, then. Murder! His own brother! He faced round and\n      said:",
                "\"You saw this in the paper, and dreamed it. Understand -- you dreamed\n      it!\"",
                "The wistful answer came:",
                "\"If only I had, Keith -- if only I had!\"",
                "In his turn, Keith very nearly wrung his hands.",
                "\"Did you take anything from the -- body?\"",
                "\"This dropped while we were struggling.\"",
                "It was an empty envelope with a South American post-mark addressed:\n      \"Patrick Walenn, Simon's Hotel, Farrier Street, London.\" Again with that\n      twitching in his heart, Keith said:",
                "\"Put it in the fire.\"",
                "Then suddenly he stooped to pluck it out. By that command -- he had -- identified\n      himself with this -- this -- But he did not pluck it out. It\n      blackened, writhed, and vanished. And once more he said:",
                "\"What in God's name made you come here and tell me?\"",
                "\"You know about these things. I didn't mean to kill him. I love the girl.\n      What shall I do, Keith?",
                "\"Simple! How simple! To ask what he was to do! It was like Larry! And he\n      said:",
                "\"You were not seen, you think?\" \"It's a dark street. There was no one\n      about.\"",
                "\"When did you leave this girl the second time?\"",
                "\"About seven o'clock.\"",

For, if there are men who by\n      force of will do one thing only at a time, there are men who from lack of\n      will do now one thing, now another; with equal intensity. To such natures,\n      to be gripped by the Nemesis which attends the lack of self-control is no\n      reason for being more self-controlled. Rather does it foster their pet\n      feeling: \"What matter? To-morrow we die!\" The effort of will required to\n      go to Keith had relieved, exhausted and exasperated him. In accordance\n      with those three feelings was the progress of his walk. He started from\n      the door with the fixed resolve to go home and stay there quietly till\n      Keith came. He was in Keith's hands, Keith would know what was to be done.\n      But he had not gone three hundred yards before he felt so utterly weary,\n      body and soul, that if he had but had a pistol in his pocket he would have\n      shot himself in the street. Not even the thought of the girl -- this\n      young unfortunate with her strange devotion, who had kept him straight\n      these last five months, who had roused in him a depth of feeling he had\n      never known before -- would have availed against that sudden black\n      defection. Why go on -- a waif at the mercy of his own nature, a straw\n      blown here and there by every gust which rose in him? Why not have done\n      with it for ever, and take it out in sleep?",
                "He was approaching the fatal street, where he and the girl, that early\n      morning, had spent the hours clutched together, trying in the refuge of\n      love to forget for a moment their horror and fear. Should he go in? He had\n      promised Keith not to. Why had he promised? He caught sight of himself in\n      a chemist's lighted window. Miserable, shadowy brute! And he remembered\n      suddenly a dog he had picked up once in the streets of Pera, a\n      black-and-white creature -- different from the other dogs, not one of\n      their breed, a pariah of pariahs, who had strayed there somehow. He had\n      taken it home to the house where he was staying, contrary to all custom of\n      the country; had got fond of it; had shot it himself, sooner than leave it\n      behind again to the mercies of its own kind in the streets. Twelve years\n      ago! And those sleevelinks made of little Turkish coins he had brought\n      back for the girl at the hairdresser's in Chancery Lane where he used to\n      get shaved -- pretty creature, like a wild rose. He had asked of her a\n      kiss for payment. What queer emotion when she put her face forward to his\n      lips -- a sort of passionate tenderness and shame, at the softness and\n      warmth of that flushed cheek, at her beauty and trustful gratitude. She\n      would soon have given herself to him -- that one! He had never gone\n      there again! And to this day he did not know why he had abstained; to this\n      day he did not know whether he were glad or sorry not to have plucked that\n      rose. He must surely have been very different then! Queer business, life -- queer,\n      queer business! -- to go through it never knowing what you would do\n      next. Ah! to be like Keith, steady, buttoned-up in success; a brass pot, a\n      pillar of society! Once, as a boy, he had been within an ace of killing\n      Keith, for sneering at him. Once in Southern Italy he had been near\n      killing a driver who was flogging his horse. And now, that dark-faced,\n      swinish bully who had ruined the girl he had grown to love -- he had\n      done it! Killed him! Killed a man!",
                "He who did not want to hurt a fly. The chemist's window comforted him with\n      the sudden thought that he had at home that which made him safe, in case\n      they should arrest him. He would never again go out without some of those\n      little white tablets sewn into the lining of his coat. Restful, even\n      exhilarating thought! They said a man should not take his own life. Let\n      them taste horror -- those glib citizens! Let them live as that girl\n      had lived, as millions lived all the world over, under their canting\n      dogmas! A man might rather even take his life than watch their cursed\n      inhumanities.",
                "He went into the chemist's for a bromide; and, while the man was mixing\n      it, stood resting one foot like a tired horse. The \"life\" he had squeezed\n      out of that fellow! After all, a billion living creatures gave up life\n      each day, had it squeezed out of them, mostly. And perhaps not one a day\n      deserved death so much as that loathly fellow. Life! a breath -- aflame!\n      Nothing! Why, then, this icy clutching at his heart?",
                "The chemist brought the draught.",
                "\"Not sleeping, sir?\"",
                "\"No.\"",
                "The man's eyes seemed to say: 'Yes! Burning the candle at both ends -- I\n      know!' Odd life, a chemist's; pills and powders all day long, to hold the\n      machinery of men together! Devilish odd trade!",
                "In going out he caught the reflection of his face in a mirror; it seemed\n      too good altogether for a man who had committed murder. There was a sort\n      of brightness underneath, an amiability lurking about its shadows; how -- how\n      could it be the face of a man who had done what he had done? His head felt\n      lighter now, his feet lighter; he walked rapidly again.",
                "Curious feeling of relief and oppression all at once! Frightful -- to\n      long for company, for talk, for distraction; and -- to be afraid of it!\n      The girl -- the girl and Keith were now the only persons who would not\n      give him that feeling of dread. And, of those two -- Keith was not...!\n      Who could consort with one who was never wrong, a successful, righteous\n      fellow; a chap built so that he knew nothing about himself, wanted to know\n      nothing, a chap all solid actions? To be a quicksand swallowing up one's\n      own resolutions was bad enough! But to be like Keith -- all willpower,\n      marching along, treading down his own feelings and weaknesses! No! One\n      could not make a comrade of a man like Keith, even if he were one's\n      brother? The only creature in all the world was the girl. She alone knew\n      and felt what he was feeling; would put up with him and love him whatever\n      he did, or was done to him. He stopped and took shelter in a doorway, to\n      light a cigarette. He had suddenly a fearful wish to pass the archway\n      where he had placed the body; a fearful wish that had no sense, no end in\n      view, no anything; just an insensate craving to see the dark place again.\n      He crossed Borrow Street to the little lane. There was only one person\n      visible, a man on the far side with his shoulders hunched against the\n      wind; a short, dark figure which crossed and came towards him in the\n      flickering lamplight. What a face! Yellow, ravaged, clothed almost to the\n      eyes in a stubbly greyish growth of beard, with blackish teeth, and\n      haunting bloodshot eyes. And what a figure of rags -- one shoulder\n      higher than the other, one leg a little lame, and thin! A surge of feeling\n      came up in Laurence for this creature, more unfortunate than himself.\n      There were lower depths than his!",
                "\"Well, brother,\" he said, \"you don't look too prosperous!\"",
                "The smile which gleamed out on the man's face seemed as unlikely as a\n      smile on a scarecrow.",
                "\"Prosperity doesn't come my way,\" he said in a rusty voice. \"I'm a failure -- always\n      been a failure. And yet you wouldn't think it, would you? -- I was a\n      minister of religion once.\"",
                "Laurence held out a shilling. But the man shook his head.",
                "\"Keep your money,\" he said. \"I've got more than you to-day, I daresay. But\n      thank you for taking a little interest. That's worth more than money to a\n      man that's down.\"",
                "\"You're right.\"",
                "\"Yes,\" the rusty voice went on; \"I'd as soon die as go on living as I do.\n      And now I've lost my self-respect. Often wondered how long a starving man\n      could go without losing his self-respect. Not so very long. You take my\n      word for that.\" And without the slightest change in the monotony of that\n      creaking voice he added:",
                "\"Did you read of the murder? Just here. I've been looking at the place.\"",
                "The words: 'So have I!' leaped up to Laurence's lips; he choked them down\n      with a sort of terror.",
                "\"I wish you better luck,\" he said. \"Goodnight!\" and hurried away. A sort\n      of ghastly laughter was forcing its way up in his throat. Was everyone\n      talking of the murder he had committed? Even the very scarecrows?",
                "III",
                "There are some natures so constituted that, due to be hung at ten o'clock,\n      they will play chess at eight. Such men invariably rise. They make\n      especially good bishops, editors, judges, impresarios, Prime ministers,\n      money-lenders, and generals; in fact, fill with exceptional credit any\n      position of power over their fellow-men. They have spiritual cold storage,\n      in which are preserved their nervous systems. In such men there is little\n      or none of that fluid sense and continuity of feeling known under those\n      vague terms, speculation, poetry, philosophy. Men of facts and of decision\n      switching imagination on and off at will, subordinating sentiment to\n      reason... one does not think of them when watching wind ripple over\n      cornfields, or swallows flying.",
                "Keith Darrant had need for being of that breed during his dinner at the\n      Tellassons. It was just eleven when he issued from the big house in\n      Portland Place and refrained from taking a cab. He wanted to walk that he\n      might better think. What crude and wanton irony there was in his\n      situation! To have been made father-confessor to a murderer, he -- well\n      on towards a judgeship! With his contempt for the kind of weakness which\n      landed men in such abysses, he felt it all so sordid, so \"impossible,\"\n       that he could hardly bring his mind to bear on it at all. And yet he must,\n      because of two powerful instincts -- self-preservation and\n      blood-loyalty.",
                "The wind had still the sapping softness of the afternoon, but rain had\n      held off so far. It was warm, and he unbuttoned his fur overcoat. The\n      nature of his thoughts deepened the dark austerity of his face, whose\n      thin, well-cut lips were always pressing together, as if, by meeting, to\n      dispose of each thought as it came up. He moved along the crowded\n      pavements glumly. That air of festive conspiracy which drops with the\n      darkness on to lighted streets, galled him. He turned off on a darker\n      route.",
                "This ghastly business! Convinced of its reality, he yet could not see it.\n      The thing existed in his mind, not as a picture, but as a piece of\n      irrefutable evidence. Larry had not meant to do it, of course. But it was\n      murder, all the same. Men like Larry -- weak, impulsive, sentimental,\n      introspective creatures -- did they ever mean what they did? This man,\n      this Walenn, was, by all accounts, better dead than alive; no need to\n      waste a thought on him! But, crime -- the ugliness -- Justice\n      unsatisfied! Crime concealed -- and his own share in the concealment!\n      And yet -- brother to brother! Surely no one could demand action from\n      him! It was only a question of what he was going to advise Larry to do. To\n      keep silent, and disappear? Had that a chance of success? Perhaps if the\n      answers to his questions had been correct. But this girl! Suppose the dead\n      man's relationship to her were ferreted out, could she be relied on not to\n      endanger Larry? These women were all the same, unstable as water,\n      emotional, shiftless pests of society. Then, too, a crime untracked,\n      dogging all his brother's after life; a secret following him wherever he\n      might vanish to; hanging over him, watching for some drunken moment, to\n      slip out of his lips. It was bad to think of. A clean breast of it? But\n      his heart twitched within him. \"Brother of Mr. Keith Darrant, the\n      well-known King's Counsel\" -- visiting a woman of the town, strangling\n      with his bare hands the woman's husband! No intention to murder, but -- a\n      dead man! A dead man carried out of the house, laid under a dark archway!\n      Provocation! Recommended to mercy -- penal servitude for life! Was that\n      the advice he was going to give Larry to-morrow morning?",
                "And he had a sudden vision of shaven men with clay-coloured features, run,\n      as it were, to seed, as he had seen them once in Pentonville, when he had\n      gone there to visit a prisoner. Larry! Whom, as a baby creature, he had\n      watched straddling; whom, as a little fellow, he had fagged; whom he had\n      seen through scrapes at college; to whom he had lent money time and again,\n      and time and again admonished in his courses. Larry! Five years younger\n      than himself; and committed to his charge by their mother when she died.\n      To become for life one of those men with faces like diseased plants; with\n      no hair but a bushy stubble; with arrows marked on their yellow clothes!\n      Larry! One of those men herded like sheep; at the beck and call of common\n      men! A gentleman, his own brother, to live that slave's life, to be\n      ordered here and there, year after year, day in, day out. Something\n      snapped within him. He could not give that advice. Impossible! But if not,\n      he must make sure of his ground, must verify, must know. This Glove Lane -- this\n      arch way? It would not be far from where he was that very moment. He\n      looked for someone of whom to make enquiry. A policeman was standing at\n      the corner, his stolid face illumined by a lamp; capable and watchful -- an\n      excellent officer, no doubt; but, turning his head away, Keith passed him\n      without a word. Strange to feel that cold, uneasy feeling in presence of\n      the law! A grim little driving home of what it all meant! Then, suddenly,\n      he saw that the turning to his left was Borrow Street itself. He walked up\n      one side, crossed over, and returned. He passed Number Forty-two, a small\n      house with business names printed on the lifeless windows of the first and\n      second floors; with dark curtained windows on the ground floor, or was\n      there just a slink of light in one corner? Which way had Larry turned?\n      Which way under that grisly burden? Fifty paces of this squalid\n      street-narrow, and dark, and empty, thank heaven! Glove Lane! Here it was!\n      A tiny runlet of a street. And here -- ! He had run right on to the\n      arch, a brick bridge connecting two portions of a warehouse, and dark\n      indeed.",
                "\"That's right, gov'nor! That's the place!\" He needed all his self-control\n      to turn leisurely to the speaker. \"'Ere's where they found the body -- very\n      spot leanin' up 'ere. They ain't got 'im yet. Lytest -- me lord!\"",
                "It was a ragged boy holding out a tattered yellowish journal. His lynx\n      eyes peered up from under lanky wisps of hair, and his voice had the\n      proprietary note of one making \"a corner\" in his news. Keith took the\n      paper and gave him twopence. He even found a sort of comfort in the young\n      ghoul's hanging about there; it meant that others besides himself had come\n      morbidly to look. By the dim lamplight he read: \"Glove Lane garrotting\n      mystery. Nothing has yet been discovered of the murdered man's identity;\n      from the cut of his clothes he is supposed to be a foreigner.\" The boy had\n      vanished, and Keith saw the figure of a policeman coming slowly down this\n      gutter of a street. A second's hesitation, and he stood firm. Nothing\n      obviously could have brought him here save this \"mystery,\" and he stayed\n      quietly staring at the arch. The policeman moved up abreast. Keith saw\n      that he was the one whom he had passed just now. He noted the cold\n      offensive question die out of the man's eyes when they caught the gleam of\n      white shirt-front under the opened fur collar. And holding up the paper,\n      he said:",
                "\"Is this where the man was found?\"",
                "\"Yes, sir.\"",
                "\"Still a mystery, I see?\"",
                "\"Well, we can't always go by the papers. But I don't fancy they do know\n      much about it, yet.\"",
                "\"Dark spot. Do fellows sleep under here?\"",
                "The policeman nodded. \"There's not an arch in London where we don't get\n      'em sometimes.\"",
                "\"Nothing found on him -- I think I read?\"",
                "\"Not a copper. Pockets inside out. There's some funny characters about\n      this quarter. Greeks, Hitalians -- all sorts.\"",
                "Queer sensation this, of being glad of a policeman's confidential tone!",
                "\"Well, good-night!\"",
                "\"Good-night, sir. Good-night!\"",
                "He looked back from Borrow Street. The policeman was still standing there\n      holding up his lantern, so that its light fell into the archway, as if\n      trying to read its secret.",
                "Now that he had seen this dark, deserted spot, the chances seemed to him\n      much better. \"Pockets inside out!\" Either Larry had had presence of mind\n      to do a very clever thing, or someone had been at the body before the\n      police found it. That was the more likely. A dead backwater of a place. At\n      three o'clock -- loneliest of all hours -- Larry's five minutes'\n      grim excursion to and fro might well have passed unseen! Now, it all\n      depended on the girl; on whether Laurence had been seen coming to her or\n      going away; on whether, if the man's relationship to her were discovered,\n      she could be relied on to say nothing. There was not a soul in Borrow\n      Street now; hardly even a lighted window; and he took one of those rather\n      desperate decisions only possible to men daily accustomed to the instant\n      taking of responsibility. He would go to her, and see for himself. He came\n      to the door of Forty-two, obviously one of those which are only shut at\n      night, and tried the larger key. It fitted, and he was in a gas-lighted\n      passage, with an oil-clothed floor, and a single door to his left. He\n      stood there undecided. She must be made to understand that he knew\n      everything. She must not be told more than that he was a friend of\n      Larry's. She must not be frightened, yet must be forced to give her very\n      soul away. A hostile witness -- not to be treated as hostile -- a\n      matter for delicate handling! But his knock was not answered.",
                "Should he give up this nerve-racking, bizarre effort to come at a basis of\n      judgment; go away, and just tell Laurence that he could not advise him?\n      And then -- what? Something must be done. He knocked again. Still no\n      answer. And with that impatience of being thwarted, natural to him, and\n      fostered to the full by the conditions of his life, he tried the other\n      key. It worked, and he opened the door. Inside all was dark, but a voice\n      from some way off, with a sort of breathless relief in its foreign tones,\n      said:",
                "\"Oh! then it's you, Larry! Why did you knock? I was so frightened. Turn up\n      the light, dear. Come in!\"",
                "Feeling by the door for a switch in the pitch blackness he was conscious\n      of arms round his neck, a warm thinly clad body pressed to his own; then\n      withdrawn as quickly, with a gasp, and the most awful terror-stricken\n      whisper:",
                "\"Oh! Who is it?\"",
                "With a glacial shiver down his own spine, Keith answered",
                "\"A friend of Laurence. Don't be frightened!\"",
                "There was such silence that he could hear a clock ticking, and the sound\n      of his own hand passing over the surface of the wall, trying to find the\n      switch. He found it, and in the light which leaped up he saw, stiffened\n      against a dark curtain evidently screening off a bedroom, a girl standing,\n      holding a long black coat together at her throat, so that her face with\n      its pale brown hair, short and square-cut and curling up underneath, had\n      an uncanny look of being detached from any body. Her face was so alabaster\n      pale that the staring, startled eyes, dark blue or brown, and the faint\n      rose of the parted lips, were like colour stainings on a white mask; and\n      it had a strange delicacy, truth, and pathos, such as only suffering\n      brings. Though not susceptible to aesthetic emotion, Keith was curiously\n      affected. He said gently:",
                "\"You needn't be afraid. I haven't come to do you harm -- quite the\n      contrary. May I sit down and talk?\" And, holding up the keys, he added:\n      \"Laurence wouldn't have given me these, would he, if he hadn't trusted\n      me?\"",
                "Still she did not move, and he had the impression that he was looking at a\n      spirit -- a spirit startled out of its flesh. Nor at the moment did it\n      seem in the least strange that he should conceive such an odd thought. He\n      stared round the room -- clean and tawdry, with its tarnished gilt\n      mirror, marble-topped side-table, and plush-covered sofa. Twenty years and\n      more since he had been in such a place. And he said:",
                "\"Won't you sit down? I'm sorry to have startled you.\"",
                "But still she did not move, whispering:",
                "\"Who are you, please?\"",
                "And, moved suddenly beyond the realm of caution by the terror in that\n      whisper, he answered:",
                "\"Larry's brother.\"",
                "She uttered a little sigh of relief which went to Keith's heart, and,\n      still holding the dark coat together at her throat, came forward and sat\n      down on the sofa. He could see that her feet, thrust into slippers, were\n      bare; with her short hair, and those candid startled eyes, she looked like\n      a tall child. He drew up a chair and said:",
                "\"You must forgive me coming at such an hour; he's told me, you see.\" He\n      expected her to flinch and gasp; but she only clasped her hands together\n      on her knees, and said:",
                "\"Yes?\"",
                "Then horror and discomfort rose up in him, afresh.",
                "\"An awful business!\"",
                "Her whisper echoed him:",
                "\"Yes, oh! yes! Awful -- it is awful!\"",
                "And suddenly realising that the man must have fallen dead just where he\n      was sitting, Keith became stock silent, staring at the floor.",
                "\"Yes,\" she whispered; \"Just there. I see him now always falling!\"",
                "How she said that! With what a strange gentle despair! In this girl of\n      evil life, who had brought on them this tragedy, what was it which moved\n      him to a sort of unwilling compassion?",
                "\"You look very young,\" he said.",
                "\"I am twenty.\"",
                "\"And you are fond of -- my brother?\"",

That something in her youth\n      and strange prettiness which had touched and kept him gentle, no longer\n      blunted the edge of his exasperation, now that he could not see her. They\n      were all the same, these women; could not speak the truth! And he said\n      brusquely:",

His brother -- son of his mother, a gentleman -- the property\n      of this girl, bound to her, body and soul, by this unspeakable event! But\n      she had turned up the light. Had she some intuition that darkness was\n      against her? Yes, she was pretty with that soft face, colourless save for\n      its lips and dark eyes, with that face somehow so touchingly, so\n      unaccountably good, and like a child's.",

                "She sighed out, \"Yes! oh, yes!\" and Keith went to the door. She was\n      standing with her back to the wall, and to follow him she only moved her\n      head -- that dove-like face with all its life in eyes which seemed\n      saying: 'Look into us; nothing we hide; all -- all is there!'",

No one in sight. He stood a moment, wondering if he should turn to\n      right or left, then briskly crossed the street. A voice to his right hand\n      said:",

                "There in the shadow of a doorway the policeman was standing. The fellow\n      must have seen him coming out! Utterly unable to restrain a start, and\n      muttering \"Goodnight!\" Keith walked on rapidly:",
                "He went full quarter of a mile before he lost that startled and uneasy\n      feeling in sardonic exasperation that he, Keith Darrant, had been taken\n      for a frequenter of a lady of the town. The whole thing -- the whole\n      thing! -- a vile and disgusting business! His very mind felt dirty and\n      breathless; his spirit, drawn out of sheath, had slowly to slide back\n      before he could at all focus and readjust his reasoning faculty.\n      Certainly, he had got the knowledge he wanted. There was less danger than\n      he thought. That girl's eyes! No mistaking her devotion. She would not\n      give Larry away. Yes! Larry must clear out -- South America -- the\n      East -- it did not matter. But he felt no relief. The cheap, tawdry\n      room had wrapped itself round his fancy with its atmosphere of murky love,\n      with the feeling it inspired, of emotion caged within those yellowish\n      walls and the red stuff of its furniture. That girl's face! Devotion;\n      truth, too, and beauty, rare and moving, in its setting of darkness and\n      horror, in that nest of vice and of disorder!... The dark archway; the\n      street arab, with his gleeful: \"They 'ain't got 'im yet!\"; the feel of\n      those bare arms round his neck; that whisper of horror in the darkness;\n      above all, again, her child face looking into his, so truthful! And\n      suddenly he stood quite still in the street. What in God's name was he\n      about? What grotesque juggling amongst shadows, what strange and ghastly\n      eccentricity was all this? The forces of order and routine, all the\n      actualities of his daily life, marched on him at that moment, and swept\n      everything before them. It was a dream, a nightmare not real! It was\n      ridiculous! That he -- he should thus be bound up with things so black\n      and bizarre!",
                "He had come by now to the Strand, that street down which every day he\n      moved to the Law Courts, to his daily work; his work so dignified and\n      regular, so irreproachable, and solid. No! The thing was all a monstrous\n      nightmare! It would go, if he fixed his mind on the familiar objects\n      around, read the names on the shops, looked at the faces passing. Far down\n      the thoroughfare he caught the outline of the old church, and beyond, the\n      loom of the Law Courts themselves. The bell of a fire-engine sounded, and\n      the horses came galloping by, with the shining metal, rattle of hoofs and\n      hoarse shouting. Here was a sensation, real and harmless, dignified and\n      customary! A woman flaunting round the corner looked up at him, and leered\n      out: \"Good-night!\" Even that was customary, tolerable. Two policemen\n      passed, supporting between them a man the worse for liquor, full of fight\n      and expletives; the sight was soothing, an ordinary thing which brought\n      passing annoyance, interest, disgust. It had begun to rain; he felt it on\n      his face with pleasure -- an actual thing, not eccentric, a thing which\n      happened every day!",
                "He began to cross the street. Cabs were going at furious speed now that\n      the last omnibus had ceased to run; it distracted him to take this actual,\n      ordinary risk run so often every day. During that crossing of the Strand,\n      with the rain in his face and the cabs shooting past, he regained for the\n      first time his assurance, shook off this unreal sense of being in the grip\n      of something, and walked resolutely to the corner of his home turning. But\n      passing into that darker stretch, he again stood still. A policeman had\n      also turned into that street on the other side. Not -- surely not!\n      Absurd! They were all alike to look at -- those fellows! Absurd! He\n      walked on sharply, and let himself into his house. But on his way upstairs\n      he could not for the life of him help raising a corner of a curtain and\n      looking from the staircase window. The policeman was marching solemnly,\n      about twenty-five yards away, paying apparently no attention to anything\n      whatever.",

                "Keith woke at five o'clock, his usual hour, without remembrance. But the\n      grisly shadow started up when he entered his study, where the lamp burned,\n      and the fire shone, and the coffee was set ready, just as when yesterday\n      afternoon Larry had stood out there against the wall. For a moment he\n      fought against realisation; then, drinking off his coffee, sat down\n      sullenly at the bureau to his customary three hours' study of the day's\n      cases.",
                "Not one word of his brief could he take in. It was all jumbled with murky\n      images and apprehensions, and for full half an hour he suffered mental\n      paralysis. Then the sheer necessity of knowing something of the case which\n      he had to open at half-past ten that morning forced him to a concentration\n      which never quite subdued the malaise at the bottom of his heart.\n      Nevertheless, when he rose at half-past eight and went into the bathroom,\n      he had earned his grim satisfaction in this victory of will-power. By\n      half-past nine he must be at Larry's. A boat left London for the Argentine\n      to-morrow. If Larry was to get away at once, money must be arranged for.\n      And then at breakfast he came on this paragraph in the paper:",

At this very minute Larry might be locked up, waiting to\n      be charged-might even have been arrested before his own visit to the girl\n      last night. If Larry were arrested, she must be implicated. What, then,\n      would be his own position? Idiot to go and look at that archway, to go and\n      see the girl! Had that policeman really followed him home? Accessory after\n      the fact! Keith Darrant, King's Counsel, man of mark! He forced himself by\n      an effort, which had something of the heroic, to drop this panicky\n      feeling. Panic never did good. He must face it, and see. He refused even\n      to hurry, calmly collected the papers wanted for the day, and attended to\n      a letter or two, before he set out in a taxi-cab to Fitzroy Street.",
                "Waiting outside there in the grey morning for his ring to be answered, he\n      looked the very picture of a man who knew his mind, a man of resolution.\n      But it needed all his will-power to ask without tremor: \"Mr. Darrant in?\"\n       to hear without sign of any kind the answer: \"He's not up yet, sir.\"",

                "Driving away, he thought: 'Queer fellow! I don't know him, shall never\n      know him!' and at once began to concentrate on the practical arrangements.\n      At his bank he drew out L400; but waiting for the notes to be counted he\n      suffered qualms. A clumsy way of doing things! If there had been more\n      time! The thought: 'Accessory after the fact!' now infected everything.\n      Notes were traceable. No other way of getting him away at once, though.\n      One must take lesser risks to avoid greater. From the bank he drove to the\n      office of the steamship line. He had told Larry he would book his passage.\n      But that would not do! He must only ask anonymously if there were\n      accommodation. Having discovered that there were vacant berths, he drove\n      on to the Law Courts. If he could have taken a morning off, he would have\n      gone down to the police court and seen them charge this man. But even that\n      was not too safe, with a face so well known as his. What would come of\n      this arrest? Nothing, surely! The police always took somebody up, to keep\n      the public quiet. Then, suddenly, he had again the feeling that it was all\n      a nightmare; Larry had never done it; the police had got the right man!\n      But instantly the memory of the girl's awe-stricken face, her figure\n      huddling on the sofa, her words \"I see him always falling!\" came back.\n      God! What a business!",
                "He felt he had never been more clear-headed and forcible than that morning\n      in court. When he came out for lunch he bought the most sensational of the\n      evening papers. But it was yet too early for news, and he had to go back\n      into court no whit wiser concerning the arrest. When at last he threw off\n      wig and gown, and had got through a conference and other necessary work,\n      he went out to Chancery Lane, buying a paper on the way.

                "Laurence had remained sitting on his bed for many minutes. An innocent man\n      in no danger! Keith had said it -- the celebrated lawyer! Could he rely\n      on that? Go out 8,000 miles, he and the girl, and leave a fellow-creature\n      perhaps in mortal peril for an act committed by himself?",
                "In the past night he had touched bottom, as he thought: become ready to\n      face anything. When Keith came in he would without murmur have accepted\n      the advice: \"Give yourself up!\" He was prepared to pitch away the end of\n      his life as he pitched from him the fag-ends of his cigarettes. And the\n      long sigh he had heaved, hearing of reprieve, had been only half relief.\n      Then, with incredible swiftness there had rushed through him a feeling of\n      unutterable joy and hope. Clean away -- into a new country, a new life!\n      The girl and he! Out there he wouldn't care, would rejoice even to have\n      squashed the life out of such a noisome beetle of a man. Out there! Under\n      a new sun, where blood ran quicker than in this foggy land, and people\n      took justice into their own hands. For it had been justice on that brute\n      even though he had not meant to kill him. And then to hear of this arrest!\n      They would be charging the man to-day. He could go and see the poor\n      creature accused of the murder he himself had committed! And he laughed.\n      Go and see how likely it was that they might hang a fellow-man in place of\n      himself? He dressed, but too shaky to shave himself, went out to a\n      barber's shop. While there he read the news which Keith had seen. In this\n      paper the name of the arrested man was given: \"John Evan, no address.\" To\n      be brought up on the charge at Bow Street. Yes! He must go. Once, twice,\n      three times he walked past the entrance of the court before at last he\n      entered and screwed himself away among the tag and bobtail.",
                "The court was crowded; and from the murmurs round he could tell that it\n      was his particular case which had brought so many there. In a dazed way he\n      watched charge after charge disposed of with lightning quickness. But were\n      they never going to reach his business? And then suddenly he saw the\n      little scarecrow man of last night advancing to the dock between two\n      policemen, more ragged and miserable than ever by light of day, like some\n      shaggy, wan, grey animal, surrounded by sleek hounds.",
                "A sort of satisfied purr was rising all round; and with horror Laurence\n      perceived that this -- this was the man accused of what he himself had\n      done -- this queer, battered unfortunate to whom he had shown a passing\n      friendliness. Then all feeling merged in the appalling interest of\n      listening. The evidence was very short. Testimony of the hotel-keeper\n      where Walenn had been staying, the identification of his body, and of a\n      snake-shaped ring he had been wearing at dinner that evening. Testimony of\n      a pawnbroker, that this same ring was pawned with him the first thing\n      yesterday morning by the prisoner. Testimony of a policeman that he had\n      noticed the man Evan several times in Glove Lane, and twice moved him on\n      from sleeping under that arch. Testimony of another policeman that, when\n      arrested at midnight, Evan had said: \"Yes; I took the ring off his finger.\n      I found him there dead .... I know I oughtn't to have done it.... I'm an\n      educated man; it was stupid to pawn the ring. I found him with his pockets\n      turned inside out.\"",
                "Fascinating and terrible to sit staring at the man in whose place he\n      should have been; to wonder when those small bright-grey bloodshot eyes\n      would spy him out, and how he would meet that glance. Like a baited\n      raccoon the little man stood, screwed back into a corner, mournful,\n      cynical, fierce, with his ridged, obtuse yellow face, and his stubbly grey\n      beard and hair, and his eyes wandering now and again amongst the crowd.\n      But with all his might Laurence kept his face unmoved. Then came the word\n      \"Remanded\"; and, more like a baited beast than ever, the man was led away.",
                "Laurence sat on, a cold perspiration thick on his forehead. Someone else,\n      then, had come on the body and turned the pockets inside out before John\n      Evan took the ring. A man such as Walenn would not be out at night without\n      money. Besides, if Evan had found money on the body he would never have\n      run the risk of taking that ring. Yes, someone else had come on the body\n      first. It was for that one to come forward, and prove that the ring was\n      still on the dead man's finger when he left him, and thus clear Evan. He\n      clung to that thought; it seemed to make him less responsible for the\n      little man's position; to remove him and his own deed one step further\n      back. If they found the person who had taken the money, it would prove\n      Evan's innocence. He came out of the court in a sort of trance. And a\n      craving to get drunk attacked him. One could not go on like this without\n      the relief of some oblivion. If he could only get drunk, keep drunk till\n      this business was decided and he knew whether he must give himself up or\n      no. He had now no fear at all of people suspecting him; only fear of\n      himself -- fear that he might go and give himself up. Now he could see\n      the girl; the danger from that was as nothing compared with the danger\n      from his own conscience. He had promised Keith not to see her. Keith had\n      been decent and loyal to him -- good old Keith! But he would never\n      understand that this girl was now all he cared about in life; that he\n      would rather be cut off from life itself than be cut off from her. Instead\n      of becoming less and less, she was becoming more and more to him -- experience\n      strange and thrilling! Out of deep misery she had grown happy -- through\n      him; out of a sordid, shifting life recovered coherence and bloom, through\n      devotion to him him, of all people in the world! It was a miracle. She\n      demanded nothing of him, adored him, as no other woman ever had -- it\n      was this which had anchored his drifting barque; this -- and her\n      truthful mild intelligence, and that burning warmth of a woman, who, long\n      treated by men as but a sack of sex, now loves at last.",
                "And suddenly, mastering his craving to get drunk, he made towards Soho. He\n      had been a fool to give those keys to Keith. She must have been frightened\n      by his visit; and, perhaps, doubly miserable since, knowing nothing,\n      imagining everything! Keith was sure to have terrified her. Poor little\n      thing!",
                "Down the street where he had stolen in the dark with the dead body on his\n      back, he almost ran for the cover of her house. The door was opened to him\n      before he knocked, her arms were round his neck, her lips pressed to his.\n      The fire was out, as if she had been unable to remember to keep warm. A\n      stool had been drawn to the window, and there she had evidently been\n      sitting, like a bird in a cage, looking out into the grey street. Though\n      she had been told that he was not to come, instinct had kept her there; or\n      the pathetic, aching hope against hope which lovers never part with.",
                "Now that he was there, her first thoughts were for his comfort. The fire\n      was lighted. He must eat, drink, smoke. There was never in her doings any\n      of the \"I am doing this for you, but you ought to be doing that for me\"\n       which belongs to so many marriages, and liaisons. She was like a devoted\n      slave, so in love with the chains that she never knew she wore them. And\n      to Laurence, who had so little sense of property, this only served to\n      deepen tenderness, and the hold she had on him. He had resolved not to\n      tell her of the new danger he ran from his own conscience. But resolutions\n      with him were but the opposites of what was sure to come; and at last the\n      words:",
                "\"They've arrested someone,\" escaped him.",
                "From her face he knew she had grasped the danger at once; had divined it,\n      perhaps, before he spoke. But she only twined her arms round him and\n      kissed his lips. And he knew that she was begging him to put his love for\n      her above his conscience. Who would ever have thought that he could feel\n      as he did to this girl who had been in the arms of many! The stained and\n      suffering past of a loved woman awakens in some men only chivalry; in\n      others, more respectable, it rouses a tigerish itch, a rancorous jealousy\n      of what in the past was given to others. Sometimes it will do both. When\n      he had her in his arms he felt no remorse for killing the coarse, handsome\n      brute who had ruined her. He savagely rejoiced in it. But when she laid\n      her head in the hollow of his shoulder, turning to him her white face with\n      the faint colour-staining on the parted lips, the cheeks, the eyelids;\n      when her dark, wide-apart, brown eyes gazed up in the happiness of her\n      abandonment -- he felt only tenderness and protection.",
                "He left her at five o'clock, and had not gone two streets' length before\n      the memory of the little grey vagabond, screwed back in the far corner of\n      the dock like a baited raccoon, of his dreary, creaking voice, took\n      possession of him again; and a kind of savagery mounted in his brain\n      against a world where one could be so tortured without having meant harm\n      to anyone.",
                "At the door of his lodgings Keith was getting out of a cab. They went in\n      together, but neither of them sat down; Keith standing with his back to\n      the carefully shut door, Laurence with his back to the table, as if they\n      knew there was a tug coming. And Keith said: \"There's room on that boat.\n      Go down and book your berth before they shut. Here's the money!\"",
                "\"I'm going to stick it, Keith.\"",
                "Keith stepped forward, and put a roll of notes on the table.",
                "\"Now look here, Larry. I've read the police court proceedings. There's\n      nothing in that. Out of prison, or in prison for a few weeks, it's all the\n      same to a night-bird of that sort. Dismiss it from your mind -- there's\n      not nearly enough evidence to convict. This gives you your chance. Take it\n      like a man, and make a new life for yourself.\"",
                "Laurence smiled; but the smile had a touch of madness and a touch of\n      malice. He took up the notes.",
                "\"Clear out, and save the honour of brother Keith. Put them back in your\n      pocket, Keith, or I'll put them in the fire. Come, take them!\" And,\n      crossing to the fire, he held them to the bars. \"Take them, or in they\n      go!\"",
                "Keith took back the notes.",
                "\"I've still got some kind of honour, Keith; if I clear out I shall have\n      none, not the rag of any, left. It may be worth more to me than that -- I\n      can't tell yet -- I can't tell.\" There was a long silence before Keith\n      answered. \"I tell you you're mistaken; no jury will convict. If they did,\n      a judge would never hang on it. A ghoul who can rob a dead body ought to\n      be in prison. What he did is worse than what you did, if you come to\n      that!\" Laurence lifted his face. \"Judge not, brother,\" he said; \"the heart\n      is a dark well.\" Keith's yellowish face grew red and swollen, as though he\n      were mastering the tickle of a bronchial cough. \"What are you going to do,\n      then? I suppose I may ask you not to be entirely oblivious of our name; or\n      is such a consideration unworthy of your honour?\" Laurence bent his head.\n      The gesture said more clearly than words: 'Don't kick a man when he's\n      down!'",
                "\"I don't know what I'm going to do -- nothing at present. I'm awfully\n      sorry, Keith; awfully sorry.\"",
                "Keith looked at him, and without another word went out.",
                "VI",
                "To any, save philosophers, reputation may be threatened almost as much by\n      disgrace to name and family as by the disgrace of self. Keith's instinct\n      was always to deal actively with danger. But this blow, whether it fell on\n      him by discovery or by confession, could not be countered. As blight falls\n      on a rose from who knows where, the scandalous murk would light on him. No\n      repulse possible! Not even a wriggling from under! Brother of a murderer\n      hung or sent to penal servitude! His daughter niece to a murderer! His\n      dead mother-a murderer's mother! And to wait day after day, week after\n      week, not knowing whether the blow would fall, was an extraordinarily\n      atrocious penance, the injustice of which, to a man of rectitude, seemed\n      daily the more monstrous.",
                "The remand had produced evidence that the murdered man had been drinking\n      heavily on the night of his death, and further evidence of the accused's\n      professional vagabondage and destitution; it was shown, too, that for some\n      time the archway in Glove Lane had been his favourite night haunt. He had\n      been committed for trial in January. This time, despite misgivings, Keith\n      had attended the police court. To his great relief Larry was not there.\n      But the policeman who had come up while he was looking at the archway, and\n      given him afterwards that scare in the girl's rooms, was chief witness to\n      the way the accused man haunted Glove Lane. Though Keith held his silk hat\n      high, he still had the uncomfortable feeling that the man had recognised\n      him.",
                "His conscience suffered few, if any, twinges for letting this man rest\n      under the shadow of the murder. He genuinely believed that there was not\n      evidence enough to convict; nor was it in him to appreciate the tortures\n      of a vagabond shut up. The scamp deserved what he had got, for robbing a\n      dead body; and in any case such a scarecrow was better off in prison than\n      sleeping out under archways in December. Sentiment was foreign to Keith's\n      character, and his justice that of those who subordinate the fates of the\n      weak and shiftless to the needful paramountcy of the strong and well\n      established.",
                "His daughter came back from school for the Christmas holidays. It was hard\n      to look up from her bright eyes and rosy cheeks and see this shadow\n      hanging above his calm and ordered life, as in a glowing room one's eye\n      may catch an impending patch of darkness drawn like a spider's web across\n      a corner of the ceiling.",
                "On the afternoon of Christmas Eve they went, by her desire, to a church in\n      Soho, where the Christmas Oratorio was being given; and coming away\n      passed, by chance of a wrong turning, down Borrow Street. Ugh! How that\n      startled moment, when the girl had pressed herself against him in the\n      dark, and her terror-stricken whisper: \"Oh! Who is it?\" leaped out before\n      him! Always that business -- that ghastly business! After the trial he\n      would have another try to get them both away. And he thrust his arm within\n      his young daughter's, hurrying her on, out of this street where shadows\n      filled all the winter air.",
                "But that evening when she had gone to bed he felt uncontrollably restless.\n      He had not seen Larry for weeks. What was he about? What desperations were\n      hatching in his disorderly brain? Was he very miserable; had he perhaps\n      sunk into a stupor of debauchery? And the old feeling of protectiveness\n      rose up in him; a warmth born of long ago Christmas Eves, when they had\n      stockings hung out in the night stuffed by a Santa Claus, whose hand never\n      failed to tuck them up, whose kiss was their nightly waft into sleep.",
                "Stars were sparkling out there over the river; the sky frosty-clear, and\n      black. Bells had not begun to ring as yet. And obeying an obscure, deep\n      impulse, Keith wrapped himself once more into his fur coat, pulled a\n      motoring cap over his eyes, and sallied forth. In the Strand he took a cab\n      to Fitzroy Street. There was no light in Larry's windows, and on a card he\n      saw the words \"To Let.\" Gone! Had he after all cleared out for good? But\n      how-without money? And the girl? Bells were ringing now in the silent\n      frostiness. Christmas Eve! And Keith thought: 'If only this wretched\n      business were off my mind! Monstrous that one should suffer for the faults\n      of others!' He took a route which led him past Borrow Street. Solitude\n      brooded there, and he walked resolutely down on the far side, looking hard\n      at the girl's window. There was a light. The curtains just failed to meet,\n      so that a thin gleam shone through. He crossed; and after glancing swiftly\n      up and down, deliberately peered in.",
                "He only stood there perhaps twenty seconds, but visual records gleaned in\n      a moment sometimes outlast the visions of hours and days. The electric\n      light was not burning; but, in the centre of the room the girl was\n      kneeling in her nightgown before a little table on which were four lighted\n      candles. Her arms were crossed on her breast; the candle-light shone on\n      her fair cropped hair, on the profile of cheek and chin, on her bowed\n      white neck. For a moment he thought her alone; then behind her saw his\n      brother in a sleeping suit, leaning against the wall, with arms crossed,\n      watching. It was the expression on his face which burned the whole thing\n      in, so that always afterwards he was able to see that little scene -- such\n      an expression as could never have been on the face of one even faintly\n      conscious that he was watched by any living thing on earth. The whole of\n      Larry's heart and feeling seemed to have come up out of him. Yearning,\n      mockery, love, despair! The depth of his feeling for this girl, his stress\n      of mind, fears, hopes; the flotsam good and evil of his soul, all\n      transfigured there, exposed and unforgettable. The candle-light shone\n      upward on to his face, twisted by the strangest smile; his eyes, darker\n      and more wistful than mortal eyes should be, seemed to beseech and mock\n      the white-clad girl, who, all unconscious, knelt without movement, like a\n      carved figure of devotion. The words seemed coming from his lips: \"Pray\n      for us! Bravo! Yes! Pray for us!\" And suddenly Keith saw her stretch out\n      her arms, and lift her face with a look of ecstasy, and Laurence starting\n      forward. What had she seen beyond the candle flames? It is the unexpected\n      which invests visions with poignancy. Nothing more strange could Keith\n      have seen in this nest of the murky and illicit. But in sheer panic lest\n      he might be caught thus spying he drew back and hurried on. So Larry was\n      living there with her! When the moment came he could still find him.",
                "Before going in, he stood full five minutes leaning on the terrace parapet\n      before his house, gazing at the star-frosted sky, and the river cut by the\n      trees into black pools, oiled over by gleams from the Embankment lamps.\n      And, deep down, behind his mere thoughts, he ached-somehow, somewhere\n      ached. Beyond the cage of all that he saw and heard and thought, he had\n      perceived something he could not reach. But the night was cold, the bells\n      silent, for it had struck twelve. Entering his house, he stole upstairs.",
                "VII",
                "If for Keith those six weeks before the Glove Lane murder trial came on\n      were fraught with uneasiness and gloom, they were for Laurence almost the\n      happiest since his youth. From the moment when he left his rooms and went\n      to the girl's to live, a kind of peace and exaltation took possession of\n      him. Not by any effort of will did he throw off the nightmare hanging over\n      him. Nor was he drugged by love. He was in a sort of spiritual catalepsy.\n      In face of fate too powerful for his will, his turmoil, anxiety, and even\n      restlessness had ceased; his life floated in the ether of \"what must come,\n      will.\" Out of this catalepsy, his spirit sometimes fell headlong into\n      black waters. In one such whirlpool he was struggling on the night of\n      Christmas Eve. When the girl rose from her knees he asked her:",
                "\"What did you see?\"",
                "Pressing close to him, she drew him down on to the floor before the fire;\n      and they sat, knees drawn up, hands clasped, like two children trying to\n      see over the edge of the world.",
                "\"It was the Virgin I saw. She stood against the wall and smiled. We shall\n      be happy soon.\"",
                "\"When we die, Wanda,\" he said, suddenly, \"let it be together. We shall\n      keep each other warm, out there.\"",
                "Huddling to him she whispered: \"Yes, oh, yes! If you die, I could not go\n      on living.\"",
                "It was this utter dependence on him, the feeling that he had rescued\n      something, which gave him sense of anchorage. That, and his buried life in\n      the retreat of these two rooms. Just for an hour in the morning, from nine\n      to ten, the charwoman would come, but not another soul all day. They never\n      went out together. He would stay in bed late, while Wanda bought what they\n      needed for the day's meals; lying on his back, hands clasped behind his\n      head, recalling her face, the movements of her slim, rounded, supple\n      figure, robing itself before his gaze; feeling again the kiss she had left\n      on his lips, the gleam of her soft eyes, so strangely dark in so fair a\n      face. In a sort of trance he would lie till she came back. Then get up to\n      breakfast about noon off things which she had cooked, drinking coffee. In\n      the afternoon he would go out alone and walk for hours, any where, so long\n      as it was East. To the East there was always suffering to be seen, always\n      that which soothed him with the feeling that he and his troubles were only\n      a tiny part of trouble; that while so many other sorrowing and shadowy\n      creatures lived he was not cut off. To go West was to encourage dejection.\n      In the West all was like Keith, successful, immaculate, ordered, resolute.\n      He would come back tired out, and sit watching her cook their little\n      dinner. The evenings were given up to love. Queer trance of an existence,\n      which both were afraid to break. No sign from her of wanting those\n      excitements which girls who have lived her life, even for a few months,\n      are supposed to need. She never asked him to take her anywhere; never, in\n      word, deed, look, seemed anything but almost rapturously content. And yet\n      he knew, and she knew, that they were only waiting to see whether Fate\n      would turn her thumb down on them. In these days he did not drink. Out of\n      his quarter's money, when it came in, he had paid his debts -- their\n      expenses were very small. He never went to see Keith, never wrote to him,\n      hardly thought of him. And from those dread apparitions -- Walenn lying\n      with the breath choked out of him, and the little grey, driven animal in\n      the dock -- he hid, as only a man can who must hide or be destroyed.\n      But daily he bought a newspaper, and feverishly, furtively scanned its\n      columns.",
                "VIII",
                "Coming out of the Law Courts on the afternoon of January 28th, at the\n      triumphant end of a desperately fought will case, Keith saw on a poster\n      the words: \"Glove Lane Murder: Trial and Verdict\"; and with a rush of\n      dismay he thought: 'Good God! I never looked at the paper this morning!'\n      The elation which had filled him a second before, the absorption he had\n      felt for two days now in the case so hardly won, seemed suddenly quite\n      sickeningly trivial. What on earth had he been doing to forget that\n      horrible business even for an instant? He stood quite still on the crowded\n      pavement, unable, really unable, to buy a paper. But his face was like a\n      piece of iron when he did step forward and hold his penny out. There it\n      was in the Stop Press! \"Glove Lane Murder. The jury returned a verdict of\n      Guilty. Sentence of death was passed.\"",
                "His first sensation was simple irritation. How had they come to commit\n      such an imbecility? Monstrous! The evidence -- ! Then the futility of\n      even reading the report, of even considering how they had come to record\n      such a verdict struck him with savage suddenness. There it was, and\n      nothing he could do or say would alter it; no condemnation of this idiotic\n      verdict would help reverse it. The situation was desperate, indeed! That\n      five minutes' walk from the Law Courts to his chambers was the longest he\n      had ever taken.",
                "Men of decided character little know beforehand what they will do in\n      certain contingencies. For the imaginations of decided people do not endow\n      mere contingencies with sufficient actuality. Keith had never really\n      settled what he was going to do if this man were condemned. Often in those\n      past weeks he had said to himself: \"Of course, if they bring him in\n      guilty, that's another thing!\" But, now that they had, he was beset by\n      exactly the same old arguments and feelings, the same instincts of loyalty\n      and protection towards Laurence and himself, intensified by the fearful\n      imminence of the danger. And yet, here was this man about to be hung for a\n      thing he had not done! Nothing could get over that! But then he was such a\n      worthless vagabond, a ghoul who had robbed a dead body. If Larry were\n      condemned in his stead, would there be any less miscarriage of justice? To\n      strangle a brute who had struck you, by the accident of keeping your hands\n      on his throat a few seconds too long, was there any more guilt in that -- was\n      there even as much, as in deliberate theft from a dead man? Reverence for\n      order, for justice, and established fact, will, often march shoulder to\n      shoulder with Jesuitry in natures to whom success is vital.",
                "In the narrow stone passage leading to his staircase, a friend had called\n      out: \"Bravo, Darrant! That was a squeak! Congratulations!\" And with a\n      bitter little smile Keith thought: 'Congratulations! I!'",
                "At the first possible moment the hurried back to the Strand, and hailing a\n      cab, he told the man to put him down at a turning near to Borrow Street.",
                "It was the girl who opened to his knock. Startled, clasping her hands, she\n      looked strange to Keith in her black skirt and blouse of some soft velvety\n      stuff the colour of faded roses. Her round, rather long throat was bare;\n      and Keith noticed fretfully that she wore gold earrings. Her eyes, so\n      pitch dark against her white face, and the short fair hair, which curled\n      into her neck, seemed both to search and to plead.",

                "With a movement, as though she despaired of words, she clasped her hands\n      over her heart. And he said:",
                "\"I see.\"",
                "He had the same strange feeling as on his first visit to her, and when\n      through the chink in the curtains he had watched her kneeling -- of\n      pity mingled with some faint sexual emotion. And crossing to the fire he\n      asked:",
                "\"May I wait for him?\"",
                "\"Oh! Please! Will you sit down?\"",
                "But Keith shook his head. And with a catch in her breath, she said:",

                "\"That poor man is a graveyard thief; a hyena; a ghoul -- not worth\n      consideration.\" And the rasp in his own voice surprised him.",
                "\"Ah!\" she sighed. \"But I am sorry for him. Perhaps he was hungry. I have\n      been hungry -- you do things then that you would not. And perhaps he\n      has no one to love; if you have no one to love you can be very bad. I\n      think of him often -- in prison.\"",
                "Between his teeth Keith muttered: \"And Laurence?\"",
                "\"We do never speak of it, we are afraid.\"",
                "\"He's not told you, then, about the trial?\"",
                "Her eyes dilated.",
                "\"The trial! Oh! He was strange last night. This morning, too, he got up\n      early. Is it-is it over?\"",
                "\"Yes.\"",

                "\"Guilty.\"",
                "For a moment Keith thought she was going to faint. She had closed her\n      eyes, and swayed so that he took a step, and put his hands on her arms.",
                "\"Listen!\" he said. \"Help me; don't let Laurence out of your sight. We must\n      have time. I must see what they intend to do. They can't be going to hang\n      this man. I must have time, I tell you. You must prevent his giving\n      himself up.\"",
                "She stood, staring in his face, while he still held her arms, gripping\n      into her soft flesh through the velvety sleeves.",

                "\"Yes-but if he has already!\"",
                "Keith felt the shiver which ran through her. And the thought rushed into\n      his mind: 'My God! Suppose the police come round while I'm here!' If Larry\n      had indeed gone to them! If that Policeman who had seen him here the night\n      after the murder should find him here again just after the verdict! He\n      said almost fiercely:",
                "\"Can I trust you not to let Larry out of your sight? Quick! Answer!\"",
                "Clasping her hands to her breast, she answered humbly:",

                "\"If he hasn't already done this, watch him like a lynx! Don't let him go\n      out without you. I'll come to-morrow morning early. You're a Catholic,\n      aren't you? Swear to me that you won't let him do anything till he's seen\n      me again.\"",
                "She did not answer, looking past him at the door; and Keith heard a key in\n      the latch. There was Laurence himself, holding in his hand a great bunch\n      of pink lilies and white narcissi. His face was pale and haggard. He said\n      quietly:",
                "\"Hallo, Keith!\"",
                "The girl's eyes were fastened on Larry's face; and Keith, looking from one\n      to the other, knew that he had never had more need for wariness.",
                "\"Have you seen?\" he said.",
                "Laurence nodded. His expression, as a rule so tell-tale of his emotions,\n      baffled Keith utterly.",

D'you understand\n      me, Larry -- I must have time.\" He knew he was talking at random. The\n      only thing was to get them away at once out of reach of confession; but he\n      dared not say so.",

                "Again Laurence nodded. And Keith looked at the girl. Would she see that he\n      did not break that promise? Her eyes were still fixed immovably on Larry's\n      face. And with the feeling that he could get no further, Keith turned to\n      go.",
                "\"Promise me,\" he said.",
                "Laurence answered: \"I promise.\"",
                "He was smiling. Keith could make nothing of that smile, nor of the\n      expression in the girl's eyes. And saying: \"I have your promise, I rely on\n      it!\" he went.",
                "IX",
                "To keep from any woman who loves, knowledge of her lover's mood, is as\n      hard as to keep music from moving the heart. But when that woman has lived\n      in suffering, and for the first time knows the comfort of love, then let\n      the lover try as he may to disguise his heart -- no use! Yet by virtue\n      of subtler abnegation she will often succeed in keeping it from him that\n      she knows.",
                "When Keith was gone the girl made no outcry, asked no questions, managed\n      that Larry should not suspect her intuition; all that evening she acted as\n      if she knew of nothing preparing within him, and through him, within\n      herself.",
                "His words, caresses, the very zest with which he helped her to prepare the\n      feast, the flowers he had brought, the wine he made her drink, the\n      avoidance of any word which could spoil their happiness, all -- all\n      told her. He was too inexorably gay and loving. Not for her -- to whom\n      every word and every kiss had uncannily the desperate value of a last word\n      and kiss -- not for her to deprive herself of these by any sign or\n      gesture which might betray her prescience. Poor soul -- she took all,\n      and would have taken more, a hundredfold. She did not want to drink the\n      wine he kept tilting into her glass, but, with the acceptance learned by\n      women who have lived her life, she did not refuse. She had never refused\n      him anything. So much had been required of her by the detestable, that\n      anything required by a loved one was but an honour.",
                "Laurence drank deeply; but he had never felt clearer, never seen things\n      more clearly. The wine gave him what he wanted, an edge to these few hours\n      of pleasure, an exaltation of energy. It dulled his sense of pity, too. It\n      was pity he was afraid of -- for himself, and for this girl. To make\n      even this tawdry room look beautiful, with firelight and candlelight, dark\n      amber wine in the glasses, tall pink lilies spilling their saffron,\n      exuding their hot perfume he and even himself must look their best. And\n      with a weight as of lead on her heart, she managed that for him, letting\n      him strew her with flowers and crush them together with herself. Not even\n      music was lacking to their feast. Someone was playing a pianola across the\n      street, and the sound, very faint, came stealing when they were silent -- swelling,\n      sinking, festive, mournful; having a far-off life of its own, like the\n      flickering fire-flames before which they lay embraced, or the lilies\n      delicate between the candles. Listening to that music, tracing with his\n      finger the tiny veins on her breast, he lay like one recovering from a\n      swoon. No parting. None! But sleep, as the firelight sleeps when flames\n      die; as music sleeps on its deserted strings.",
                "And the girl watched him.",
                "It was nearly ten when he bade her go to bed. And after she had gone\n      obedient into the bedroom, he brought ink and paper down by the fire. The\n      drifter, the unstable, the good-for-nothing -- did not falter. He had\n      thought, when it came to the point, he would fail himself; but a sort of\n      rage bore him forward. If he lived on, and confessed, they would shut him\n      up, take from him the one thing he loved, cut him off from her; sand up\n      his only well in the desert. Curse them! And he wrote by firelight which\n      mellowed the white sheets of paper; while, against the dark curtain, the\n      girl, in her nightgown, unconscious of the cold, stood watching.",
                "Men, when they drown, remember their pasts. Like the lost poet he had\n      \"gone with the wind.\" Now it was for him to be true in his fashion. A man\n      may falter for weeks and weeks, consciously, subconsciously, even in his\n      dreams, till there comes that moment when the only thing impossible is to\n      go on faltering. The black cap, the little driven grey man looking up at\n      it with a sort of wonder -- faltering had ceased!",
                "He had finished now, and was but staring into the fire.",
                "\"No more, no more, the moon is dead,\n          And all the people in it;\n          The poppy maidens strew the bed,\n          We'll come in half a minute.\"",
                "Why did doggerel start up in the mind like that? Wanda! The weed-flower\n      become so rare he would not be parted from her! The fire, the candles, and\n      the fire -- no more the flame and flicker!",
                "And, by the dark curtain, the girl watched.",
                "X",
                "Keith went, not home, but to his club; and in the room devoted to the\n      reception of guests, empty at this hour, he sat down and read the report\n      of the trial. The fools had made out a case that looked black enough. And\n      for a long time, on the thick soft carpet which let out no sound of\n      footfall, he paced up and down, thinking. He might see the defending\n      counsel, might surely do that as an expert who thought there had been\n      miscarriage of justice. They must appeal; a petition too might be started\n      in the last event. The thing could -- must be put right yet, if only\n      Larry and that girl did nothing!",
                "He had no appetite, but the custom of dining is too strong. And while he\n      ate, he glanced with irritation at his fellow-members. They looked so at\n      their ease. Unjust -- that this black cloud should hang over one\n      blameless as any of them! Friends, connoisseurs of such things -- a\n      judge among them -- came specially to his table to express their\n      admiration of his conduct of that will case. Tonight he had real excuse\n      for pride, but he felt none. Yet, in this well-warmed quietly glowing\n      room, filled with decorously eating, decorously talking men, he gained\n      insensibly some comfort. This surely was reality; that shadowy business\n      out there only the drear sound of a wind one must and did keep out -- like\n      the poverty and grime which had no real existence for the secure and\n      prosperous. He drank champagne. It helped to fortify reality, to make\n      shadows seem more shadowy. And down in the smoking-room he sat before the\n      fire, in one of those chairs which embalm after-dinner dreams. He grew\n      sleepy there, and at eleven o'clock rose to go home. But when he had once\n      passed down the shallow marble steps, out through the revolving door which\n      let in no draughts, he was visited by fear, as if he had drawn it in with\n      the breath of the January wind. Larry's face; and the girl watching it!\n      Why had she watched like that? Larry's smile; and the flowers in his hand?\n      Buying flowers at such a moment! The girl was his slave-whatever he told\n      her, she would do. But she would never be able to stop him. At this very\n      moment he might be rushing to give himself up!",
                "His hand, thrust deep into the pocket of his fur coat, came in contact\n      suddenly with something cold. The keys Larry had given him all that time\n      ago. There they had lain forgotten ever since. The chance touch decided\n      him. He turned off towards Borrow Street, walking at full speed. He could\n      but go again and see. He would sleep better if he knew that he had left no\n      stone unturned. At the corner of that dismal street he had to wait for\n      solitude before he made for the house which he now loathed with a deadly\n      loathing. He opened the outer door and shut it to behind him. He knocked,\n      but no one came. Perhaps they had gone to bed. Again and again he knocked,\n      then opened the door, stepped in, and closed it carefully. Candles\n      lighted, the fire burning; cushions thrown on the floor in front of it and\n      strewn with flowers! The table, too, covered with flowers and with the\n      remnants of a meal. Through the half-drawn curtain he could see that the\n      inner room was also lighted. Had they gone out, leaving everything like\n      this? Gone out! His heart beat. Bottles! Larry had been drinking!",
                "Had it really come? Must he go back home with this murk on him; knowing\n      that his brother was a confessed and branded murderer? He went quickly, to\n      the half-drawn curtains and looked in. Against the wall he saw a bed, and\n      those two in it. He recoiled in sheer amazement and relief. Asleep with\n      curtains undrawn, lights left on? Asleep through all his knocking! They\n      must both be drunk. The blood rushed up in his neck. Asleep! And rushing\n      forward again, he called out: \"Larry!\" Then, with a gasp he went towards\n      the bed. \"Larry!\" No answer! No movement! Seizing his brother's shoulder,\n      he shook it violently. It felt cold. They were lying in each other's arms,\n      breast to breast, lips to lips, their faces white in the light shining\n      above the dressing-table. And such a shudder shook Keith that he had to\n      grasp the brass rail above their heads. Then he bent down, and wetting his\n      finger, placed it close to their joined lips. No two could ever swoon so\n      utterly as that; not even a drunken sleep could be so fast. His wet finger\n      felt not the faintest stir of air, nor was there any movement in the\n      pulses of their hands. No breath! No life! The eyes of the girl were\n      closed. How strangely innocent she looked! Larry's open eyes seemed to be\n      gazing at her shut eyes; but Keith saw that they were sightless. With a\n      sort of sob he drew down the lids. Then, by an impulse that he could never\n      have explained, he laid a hand on his brother's head, and a hand on the\n      girl's fair hair. The clothes had fallen down a little from her bare\n      shoulder; he pulled them up, as if to keep her warm, and caught the glint\n      of metal; a tiny gilt crucifix no longer than a thumbnail, on a thread of\n      steel chain, had slipped down from her breast into the hollow of the arm\n      which lay round Larry's neck. Keith buried it beneath the clothes and\n      noticed an envelope pinned to the coverlet; bending down, he read: \"Please\n      give this at once to the police. -- LAURENCE DARRANT.\" He thrust it\n      into his pocket. Like elastic stretched beyond its uttermost, his reason,\n      will, faculties of calculation and resolve snapped to within him. He\n      thought with incredible swiftness: 'I must know nothing of this. I must\n      go!' And, almost before he knew that he had moved, he was out again in the\n      street.",
                "He could never have told of what he thought while he was walking home. He\n      did not really come to himself till he was in his study. There, with a\n      trembling hand, he poured himself out whisky and drank it off. If he had\n      not chanced to go there, the charwoman would have found them when she came\n      in the morning, and given that envelope to the police! He took it out. He\n      had a right -- a right to know what was in it! He broke it open.",
                "\"I, Laurence Darrant, about to die by my own hand, declare that this is a\n      solemn and true confession. I committed what is known as the Glove Lane\n      Murder on the night of November the 27th last in the following way\" -- on\n      and on to the last words -- \"We didn't want to die; but we could not\n      bear separation, and I couldn't face letting an innocent man be hung for\n      me. I do not see any other way. I beg that there may be no postmortem on\n      our bodies. The stuff we have taken is some of that which will be found on\n      the dressing-table. Please bury us together.",
                "\"LAURENCE DARRANT.",
                "\"January the 28th, about ten o'clock p.m.\"",
                "Full five minutes Keith stood with those sheets of paper in his hand,\n      while the clock ticked, the wind moaned a little in the trees outside, the\n      flames licked the logs with the quiet click and ruffle of their intense\n      far-away life down there on the hearth. Then he roused himself, and sat\n      down to read the whole again.",
                "There it was, just as Larry had told it to him-nothing left out, very\n      clear; even to the addresses of people who could identify the girl as\n      having once been Walenn's wife or mistress. It would convince. Yes! It\n      would convince.",
                "The sheets dropped from his hand. Very slowly he was grasping the\n      appalling fact that on the floor beside his chair lay the life or death of\n      yet another man; that by taking this confession he had taken into his own\n      hands the fate of the vagabond lying under sentence of death; that he\n      could not give him back his life without incurring the smirch of this\n      disgrace, without even endangering himself. If he let this confession\n      reach the authorities, he could never escape the gravest suspicion that he\n      had known of the whole affair during these two months. He would have to\n      attend the inquest, be recognised by that policeman as having come to the\n      archway to see where the body had lain, as having visited the girl the\n      very evening after the murder. Who would believe in the mere coincidence\n      of such visits on the part of the murderer's brother. But apart from that\n      suspicion, the fearful scandal which so sensational an affair must make\n      would mar his career, his life, his young daughter's life! Larry's suicide\n      with this girl would make sensation enough as it was; but nothing to that\n      other. Such a death had its romance; involved him in no way save as a\n      mourner, could perhaps even be hushed up! The other -- nothing could\n      hush that up, nothing prevent its ringing to the house-tops. He got up\n      from his chair, and for many minutes roamed the room unable to get his\n      mind to bear on the issue. Images kept starting up before him. The face of\n      the man who handed him wig and gown each morning, puffy and curious, with\n      a leer on it he had never noticed before; his young daughter's lifted\n      eyebrows, mouth drooping, eyes troubled; the tiny gilt crucifix glinting\n      in the hollow of the dead girl's arm; the sightless look in Larry's\n      unclosed eyes; even his own thumb and finger pulling the lids down. And\n      then he saw a street and endless people passing, turning to stare at him.\n      And, stopping in his tramp, he said aloud: \"Let them go to hell! Seven\n      days' wonder!\" Was he not trustee to that confession! Trustee! After all\n      he had done nothing to be ashamed of, even if he had kept knowledge dark.\n      A brother! Who could blame him? And he picked up those sheets of paper.\n      But, like a great murky hand, the scandal spread itself about him; its\n      coarse malignant voice seemed shouting: \"Paiper!... Paiper!... Glove Lane\n      Murder!... Suicide and confession of brother of well-known K.C.....\n      Well-known K.C.'. brother.... Murder and suicide.... Paiper!\" Was he to\n      let loose that flood of foulness? Was he, who had done nothing, to smirch\n      his own little daughter's life; to smirch his dead brother, their dead\n      mother -- himself, his own valuable, important future? And all for a\n      sewer rat! Let him hang, let the fellow hang if he must! And that was not\n      certain. Appeal! Petition! He might -- he should be saved! To have got\n      thus far, and then, by his own action, topple himself down!",
                "With a sudden darting movement he thrust the confession in among the\n      burning coals. And a smile licked at the folds in his dark face, like\n      those flames licking the sheets of paper, till they writhed and blackened.\n      With the toe of his boot he dispersed their scorched and crumbling wafer.\n      Stamp them in! Stamp in that man's life! Burnt! No more doubts, no more of\n      this gnawing fear! Burnt? A man -- an innocent-sewer rat! Recoiling\n      from the fire he grasped his forehead. It was burning hot and seemed to be\n      going round.",
                "Well, it was done! Only fools without will or purpose regretted. And\n      suddenly he laughed. So Larry had died for nothing! He had no will, no\n      purpose, and was dead! He and that girl might now have been living, loving\n      each other in the warm night, away at the other end of the world, instead\n      of lying dead in the cold night here! Fools and weaklings regretted,\n      suffered from conscience and remorse. A man trod firmly, held to his\n      purpose, no matter what!",
                "He went to the window and drew back the curtain. What was that? A gibbet\n      in the air, a body hanging? Ah! Only the trees -- the dark trees -- the\n      winter skeleton trees! Recoiling, he returned to his armchair and sat down\n      before the fire. It had been shining like that, the lamp turned low, his\n      chair drawn up, when Larry came in that afternoon two months ago. Bah! He\n      had never come at all! It was a nightmare. He had been asleep. How his\n      head burned! And leaping up, he looked at the calendar on his bureau.\n      \"January the 28th!\" No dream! His face hardened and darkened. On! Not like\n      Larry! On! 1914."

                "In the City of Liverpool, on a January day of 1905, the Board-room of \"The\n      Island Navigation Company\" rested, as it were, after the labours of the\n      afternoon. The long table was still littered with the ink, pens,\n      blotting-paper, and abandoned documents of six persons -- a deserted\n      battlefield of the brain. And, lonely, in his chairman's seat at the top\n      end old Sylvanus Heythorp sat, with closed eyes, still and heavy as an\n      image. One puffy, feeble hand, whose fingers quivered, rested on the arm\n      of his chair; the thick white hair on his massive head glistened in the\n      light from a green-shaded lamp. He was not asleep, for every now and then\n      his sanguine cheeks filled, and a sound, half sigh, half grunt, escaped\n      his thick lips between a white moustache and the tiny tuft of white hairs\n      above his cleft chin. Sunk in the chair, that square thick trunk of a body\n      in short black-braided coat seemed divested of all neck.",
                "Young Gilbert Farney, secretary of \"The Island Navigation Company,\"\n       entering his hushed Board-room, stepped briskly to the table, gathered\n      some papers, and stood looking at his chairman. Not more than thirty-five,\n      with the bright hues of the optimist in his hair, beard, cheeks, and eyes,\n      he had a nose and lips which curled ironically. For, in his view, he was\n      the Company; and its Board did but exist to chequer his importance. Five\n      days in the week for seven hours a day he wrote, and thought, and wove the\n      threads of its business, and this lot came down once a week for two or\n      three hours, and taught their grandmother to suck eggs. But watching that\n      red-cheeked, white-haired, somnolent figure, his smile was not so\n      contemptuous as might have been expected. For after all, the chairman was\n      a wonderful old boy. A man of go and insight could not but respect him.\n      Eighty! Half paralysed, over head and ears in debt, having gone the pace\n      all his life -- or so they said! -- till at last that mine in\n      Ecuador had done for him -- before the secretary's day, of course, but\n      he had heard of it. The old chap had bought it up on spec' -- \"de\n      l'audace, toujours de l'audace,\" as he was so fond of saying -- paid\n      for it half in cash and half in promises, and then -- the thing had\n      turned out empty, and left him with L20,000 worth of the old shares\n      unredeemed. The old boy had weathered it out without a bankruptcy so far.\n      Indomitable old buffer; and never fussy like the rest of them! Young\n      Farney, though a secretary, was capable of attachment; and his eyes\n      expressed a pitying affection. The Board meeting had been long and\n      \"snadgy\" -- a final settling of that Pillin business. Rum go the\n      chairman forcing it on them like this! And with quiet satisfaction the\n      secretary thought 'And he never would have got it through if I hadn't made\n      up my mind that it really is good business!' For to expand the company was\n      to expand himself. Still, to buy four ships with the freight market so\n      depressed was a bit startling, and there would be opposition at the\n      general meeting. Never mind! He and the chairman could put it through -- put\n      it through. And suddenly he saw the old man looking at him.",
                "Only from those eyes could one appreciate the strength of life yet flowing\n      underground in that well-nigh helpless carcase -- deep-coloured little\n      blue wells, tiny, jovial, round windows.",
                "A sigh travelled up through layers of flesh, and he said almost inaudibly:",
                "\"Have they come, Mr. Farney?\"",
                "\"Yes, sir. I've put them in the transfer office; said you'd be with them\n      in a minute; but I wasn't going to wake you.\"",
                "\"Haven't been asleep. Help me up.\"",
                "Grasping the edge of the table with his trembling hands, the old man\n      pulled, and, with Farney heaving him behind, attained his feet. He stood\n      about five feet ten, and weighed fully fourteen stone; not corpulent, but\n      very thick all through; his round and massive head alone would have\n      outweighed a baby. With eyes shut, he seemed to be trying to get the\n      better of his own weight, then he moved with the slowness of a barnacle\n      towards the door. The secretary, watching him, thought: 'Marvellous old\n      chap! How he gets about by himself is a miracle! And he can't retire, they\n      say-lives on his fees!'",
                "But the chairman was through the green baize door. At his tortoise gait he\n      traversed the inner office, where the youthful clerks suspended their\n      figuring -- to grin behind his back -- and entered the transfer\n      office, where eight gentlemen were sitting. Seven rose, and one did not.\n      Old Heythorp raised a saluting hand to the level of his chest and moving\n      to an arm-chair, lowered himself into it.",
                "\"Well, gentlemen?\"",
                "One of the eight gentlemen got up again.",
                "\"Mr. Heythorp, we've appointed Mr. Brownbee to voice our views. Mr.\n      Brownbee!\" And down he sat.",
                "Mr. Brownbee rose a stoutish man some seventy years of age, with little\n      grey side whiskers, and one of those utterly steady faces only to be seen\n      in England, faces which convey the sense of business from father to son\n      for generations; faces which make wars, and passion, and free thought seem\n      equally incredible; faces which inspire confidence, and awaken in one a\n      desire to get up and leave the room. Mr. Brownbee rose, and said in a\n      suave voice:",
                "\"Mr. Heythorp, we here represent about L14,000. When we had the pleasure\n      of meeting you last July, you will recollect that you held out a prospect\n      of some more satisfactory arrangement by Christmas. We are now in January,\n      and I am bound to say we none of us get younger.\"",
                "From the depths of old Heythorp a preliminary rumble came travelling,\n      reached the surface, and materialised --",
                "\"Don't know about you -- feel a boy, myself.\"",
                "The eight gentlemen looked at him. Was he going to try and put them off\n      again? Mr. Brownbee said with unruffled calm:",
                "\"I'm sure we're very glad to hear it. But to come to the point. We have\n      felt, Mr. Heythorp, and I'm sure you won't think it unreasonable, that -- er -- bankruptcy\n      would be the most satisfactory solution. We have waited a long time, and\n      we want to know definitely where we stand; for, to be quite frank, we\n      don't see any prospect of improvement; indeed, we fear the opposite.\"",
                "\"You think I'm going to join the majority.\"",
                "This plumping out of what was at the back of their minds produced in Mr.\n      Brownbee and his colleagues a sort of chemical disturbance. They coughed,\n      moved their feet, and turned away their eyes, till the one who had not\n      risen, a solicitor named Ventnor, said bluffly:",
                "\"Well, put it that way if you like.\"",
                "Old Heythorp's little deep eyes twinkled.",
                "\"My grandfather lived to be a hundred; my father ninety-six -- both of\n      them rips. I'm only eighty, gentlemen; blameless life compared with\n      theirs.\"",
                "\"Indeed,\" Mr. Brownbee said, \"we hope you have many years of this life\n      before you.\"",
                "\"More of this than of another.\" And a silence fell, till old Heythorp\n      added: \"You're getting a thousand a year out of my fees. Mistake to kill\n      the goose that lays the golden eggs. I'll make it twelve hundred. If you\n      force me to resign my directorships by bankruptcy, you won't get a rap,\n      you know.\"",
                "Mr. Brownbee cleared his throat:",
                "\"We think, Mr. Heythorp, you should make it at least fifteen hundred. In\n      that case we might perhaps consider -- \"",
                "Old Heythorp shook his head.",
                "\"We can hardly accept your assertion that we should get nothing in the\n      event of bankruptcy. We fancy you greatly underrate the possibilities.\n      Fifteen hundred a year is the least you can do for us.\"",
                "\"See you d -- -d first.\"",
                "Another silence followed, then Ventnor, the solicitor, said irascibly:",
                "\"We know where we are, then.\"",
                "Brownbee added almost nervously:",
                "\"Are we to understand that twelve hundred a year is your -- your last\n      word?\"",
                "Old Heythorp nodded. \"Come again this day month, and I'll see what I can\n      do for you;\" and he shut his eyes.",
                "Round Mr. Brownbee six of the gentlemen gathered, speaking in low voices;\n      Mr. Ventnor nursed a leg and glowered at old Heythorp, who sat with his\n      eyes closed. Mr. Brownbee went over and conferred with Mr. Ventnor, then\n      clearing his throat, he said:",
                "\"Well, sir, we have considered your proposal; we agree to accept it for\n      the moment. We will come again, as you suggest, in a month's time.",
                "\"We hope that you will by then have seen your way to something more\n      substantial, with a view to avoiding what we should all regret, but which\n      I fear will otherwise become inevitable.\"",
                "Old Heythorp nodded. The eight gentlemen took their hats, and went out one\n      by one, Mr. Brownbee courteously bringing up the rear.",
                "The old man, who could not get up without assistance, stayed musing in his\n      chair. He had diddled 'em for the moment into giving him another month,\n      and when that month was up-he would diddle 'em again! A month ought to\n      make the Pillin business safe, with all that hung on it. That poor funkey\n      chap Joe Pillin! A gurgling chuckle escaped his red lips. What a shadow\n      the fellow had looked, trotting in that evening just a month ago, behind\n      his valet's announcement: \"Mr. Pillin, sir.\"",

                "A pause, a twinkle, a puff of smoke. \"Make it worth my while!\" He had said\n      it in jest; and then, in a flash, the idea had come to him. Rosamund and\n      her youngsters! What a chance to put something between them and\n      destitution when he had joined the majority! And so he said: \"We don't\n      want your silly ships.\"",
                "That claw of a hand waved in deprecation. \"They're very good ships -- doing\n      quite well. It's only my wretched health. If I were a strong man I\n      shouldn't dream....\"",

                "\"Yes, yes. Good-bye. I can't imagine how you still go on smoking those\n      things and drinking port.",
                "\"See you in your grave yet, Joe.\" What a feeble smile the poor fellow had!\n      Laugh-he couldn't! And, alone again, he had browsed, developing the idea\n      which had come to him.",
                "Though, to dwell in the heart of shipping, Sylvanus Heythorp had lived at\n      Liverpool twenty years, he was from the Eastern Counties, of a family so\n      old that it professed to despise the Conquest. Each of its generations\n      occupied nearly twice as long as those of less tenacious men.\n      Traditionally of Danish origin, its men folk had as a rule bright\n      reddish-brown hair, red cheeks, large round heads, excellent teeth and\n      poor morals. They had done their best for the population of any county in\n      which they had settled; their offshoots swarmed. Born in the early\n      twenties of the nineteenth century, Sylvanus Heythorp, after an education\n      broken by escapades both at school and college, had fetched up in that\n      simple London of the late forties, where claret, opera, and eight per\n      cent. for your money ruled a cheery roost. Made partner in his shipping\n      firm well before he was thirty, he had sailed with a wet sheet and a\n      flowing tide; dancers, claret, Cliquot, and piquet; a cab with a tiger;\n      some travel -- all that delicious early-Victorian consciousness of\n      nothing save a golden time. It was all so full and mellow that he was\n      forty before he had his only love affair of any depth -- with the\n      daughter of one of his own clerks, a liaison so awkward as to necessitate\n      a sedulous concealment. The death of that girl, after three years, leaving\n      him a natural son, had been the chief, perhaps the only real, sorrow of\n      his life. Five years later he married. What for? God only knew! as he was\n      in the habit of remarking. His wife had been a hard, worldly,\n      well-connected woman, who presented him with two unnatural children, a\n      girl and a boy, and grew harder, more worldly, less handsome, in the\n      process. The migration to Liverpool, which took place when he was sixty\n      and she forty-two, broke what she still had of heart, but she lingered on\n      twelve years, finding solace in bridge, and being haughty towards\n      Liverpool. Old Heythorp saw her to her rest without regret. He had felt no\n      love for her whatever, and practically none for her two children -- they\n      were in his view colourless, pragmatical, very unexpected characters. His\n      son Ernest -- in the Admiralty -- he thought a poor, careful stick.\n      His daughter Adela, an excellent manager, delighting in spiritual\n      conversation and the society of tame men, rarely failed to show him that\n      she considered him a hopeless heathen. They saw as little as need be of\n      each other. She was provided for under that settlement he had made on her\n      mother fifteen years ago, well before the not altogether unexpected crisis\n      in his affairs. Very different was the feeling he had bestowed on that son\n      of his \"under the rose.\" The boy, who had always gone by his mother's name\n      of Larne, had on her death been sent to some relations of hers in Ireland,\n      and there brought up. He had been called to the Dublin bar, and married,\n      young, a girl half Cornish and half Irish; presently, having cost old\n      Heythorp in all a pretty penny, he had died impecunious, leaving his fair\n      Rosamund at thirty with a girl of eight and a boy of five. She had not\n      spent six months of widowhood before coming over from Dublin to claim the\n      old man's guardianship. A remarkably pretty woman, like a full-blown rose,\n      with greenish hazel eyes, she had turned up one morning at the offices of\n      \"The Island Navigation Company,\" accompanied by her two children -- for\n      he had never divulged to them his private address. And since then they had\n      always been more or less on his hands, occupying a small house in a suburb\n      of Liverpool. He visited them there, but never asked them to the house in\n      Sefton Park, which was in fact his daughter's; so that his proper family\n      and friends were unaware of their existence.",
                "Rosamund Larne was one of those precarious ladies who make uncertain\n      incomes by writing full-bodied storyettes. In the most dismal\n      circumstances she enjoyed a buoyancy bordering on the indecent; which\n      always amused old Heythorp's cynicism. But of his grandchildren Phyllis\n      and Jock (wild as colts) he had become fond. And this chance of getting\n      six thousand pounds settled on them at a stroke had seemed to him nothing\n      but heaven-sent. As things were, if he \"went off\" -- and, of course, he\n      might at any moment, there wouldn't be a penny for them; for he would \"cut\n      up\" a good fifteen thousand to the bad. He was now giving them some three\n      hundred a year out of his fees; and dead directors unfortunately earned no\n      fees! Six thousand pounds at four and a half per cent., settled so that\n      their mother couldn't \"blue it,\" would give them a certain two hundred and\n      fifty pounds a year-better than beggary. And the more he thought the\n      better he liked it, if only that shaky chap, Joe Pillin, didn't shy off\n      when he'd bitten his nails short over it!",

                "\"Guardy, you were my dear Philip's father, weren't you? I've never said\n      anything; but of course you were. He was so like you, and so is Jock.\"",
                "Nothing moved in old Heythorp's face. No pagan image consulted with\n      flowers and song and sacrifice could have returned less answer. Her dear\n      Philip! She had led him the devil of a life, or he was a Dutchman! And\n      what the deuce made her suddenly trot out the skeleton like this? But Mrs.\n      Larne's eyes were still wandering.",

                "With a rumbling sigh he answered:",
                "\"Wait. Can't give you a penny now. Poor as a church mouse.\"",
                "\"Oh! Guardy",
                "\"Fact.\"",
                "Mrs. Larne heaved one of her most buoyant sighs. She certainly did not\n      believe him.",
                "\"Well!\" she said; \"you'll be sorry when we come round one night and sing\n      for pennies under your window. Wouldn't you like to see Phyllis? I left\n      her in the hall. She's growing such a sweet gairl. Guardy just fifty!\"",
                "\"Not a rap.\"",
                "Mrs. Larne threw up her hands. \"Well! You'll repent it. I'm at my last\n      gasp.\" She sighed profoundly, and the perfume of violets escaped in a\n      cloud; Then, getting up, she went to the door and called: \"Phyllis!\"",
                "When the girl entered old Heythorp felt the nearest approach to a flutter\n      of the heart for many years. She had put her hair up! She was like a\n      spring day in January; such a relief from that scented humbug, her mother.\n      Pleasant the touch of her lips on his forehead, the sound of her clear\n      voice, the sight of her slim movements, the feeling that she did him\n      credit -- clean-run stock, she and that young scamp Jock -- better\n      than the holy woman, his daughter Adela, would produce if anyone were ever\n      fool enough to marry her, or that pragmatical fellow, his son Ernest.",
                "And when they were gone he reflected with added zest on the six thousand\n      pounds he was getting for them out of Joe Pillin and his ships. He would\n      have to pitch it strong in his speech at the general meeting. With\n      freights so low, there was bound to be opposition. No dash nowadays;\n      nothing but gabby caution! They were a scrim-shanking lot on the Board -- he\n      had had to pull them round one by one -- the deuce of a tug getting\n      this thing through! And yet, the business was sound enough. Those ships\n      would earn money, properly handled-good money.",
                "His valet, coming in to prepare him for dinner, found him asleep. He had\n      for the old man as much admiration as may be felt for one who cannot put\n      his own trousers on. He would say to the housemaid Molly: \"He's a game old\n      blighter -- must have been a rare one in his day. Cocks his hat at you,\n      even now, I see!\" To which the girl, Irish and pretty, would reply: \"Well,\n      an' sure I don't mind, if it gives um a pleasure. 'Tis better anyway than\n      the sad eye I get from herself.\"",
                "At dinner, old Heythorp always sat at one end of the rosewood table and\n      his daughter at the other. It was the eminent moment of the day. With\n      napkin tucked high into his waistcoat, he gave himself to the meal with\n      passion. His palate was undimmed, his digestion unimpaired. He could still\n      eat as much as two men, and drink more than one. And while he savoured\n      each mouthful he never spoke if he could help it. The holy woman had\n      nothing to say that he cared to hear, and he nothing to say that she cared\n      to listen to. She had a horror, too, of what she called \"the pleasures of\n      the table\" -- those lusts of the flesh! She was always longing to dock\n      his grub, he knew. Would see her further first! What other pleasures were\n      there at his age? Let her wait till she was eighty. But she never would\n      be; too thin and holy!",
                "This evening, however, with the advent of the partridge she did speak.",

                "Trust her for nosing anything out! Fixing his little blue eyes on her, he\n      mumbled with a very full mouth: \"Ladies.\"",
                "\"So I saw; what ladies?\"",
                "He had a longing to say: 'Part of one of my families under the rose.' As a\n      fact it was the best part of the only one, but the temptation to multiply\n      exceedingly was almost overpowering. He checked himself, however, and went\n      on eating partridge, his secret irritation crimsoning his cheeks; and he\n      watched her eyes, those cold precise and round grey eyes, noting it, and\n      knew she was thinking: 'He eats too much.'",
                "She said: \"Sorry I'm not considered fit to be told. You ought not to be\n      drinking hock.\"",
                "Old Heythorp took up the long green glass, drained it, and repressing\n      fumes and emotion went on with his partridge. His daughter pursed her\n      lips, took a sip of water, and said:",
                "\"I know their name is Larne, but it conveyed nothing to me; perhaps it's\n      just as well.\"",

                "\"No.\"",
                "The expression on her face was as good as a play!",
                "She said with a sort of disgust: \"Not married! I see. I suppose those\n      people are hanging round your neck, then; no wonder you're always in\n      difficulties. Are there any more of them?\"",
                "Again the old man suppressed that spasm, and the veins in his neck and\n      forehead swelled alarmingly. If he had spoken he would infallibly have\n      choked. He ceased eating, and putting his hands on the table tried to\n      raise himself. He could not and subsiding in his chair sat glaring at the\n      stiff, quiet figure of his daughter.",
                "\"Don't be silly, Father, and make a scene before Meller. Finish your\n      dinner.\"",
                "He did not answer. He was not going to sit there to be dragooned and\n      insulted! His helplessness had never so weighed on him before. It was like\n      a revelation. A log -- that had to put up with anything! A log! And,\n      waiting for his valet to return, he cunningly took up his fork.",
                "In that saintly voice of hers she said:",
                "\"I suppose you don't realise that it's a shock to me. I don't know what\n      Ernest will think -- \"",
                "\"Ernest be d -- -d.\"",
                "\"I do wish, Father, you wouldn't swear.\"",
                "Old Heythorp's rage found vent in a sort of rumble. How the devil had he\n      gone on all these years in the same house with that woman, dining with her\n      day after day! But the servant had come back now, and putting down his\n      fork he said:",
                "\"Help me up!\"",
                "The man paused, thunderstruck, with the souffle balanced. To leave dinner\n      unfinished -- it was a portent!",

                "Raised to his feet, he walked slowly out; but in his sanctum he did not\n      sit down, obsessed by this first overwhelming realisation of his\n      helplessness. He stood swaying a little, holding on to the table, till the\n      servant, having finished serving dinner, brought in his port.",
                "\"Are you waiting to sit down, sir?\"",
                "He shook his head. Hang it, he could do that for himself, anyway. He must\n      think of something to fortify his position against that woman. And he\n      said:",
                "\"Send me Molly!\"",
                "\"Yes, sir.\" The man put down the port and went.",
                "Old Heythorp filled his glass, drank, and filled again. He took a cigar\n      from the box and lighted it. The girl came in, a grey-eyed, dark-haired\n      damsel, and stood with her hands folded, her head a little to one side,\n      her lips a little parted. The old man said:",

                "He nodded, and when she had gone lowered himself into his chair with a\n      sense of appeasement. Pretty girl! Comfort to see a pretty face -- not\n      a pale, peeky thing like Adela's. His anger burned up anew. So she counted\n      on his helplessness, had begun to count on that, had she? She should see\n      that there was life in the old dog yet! And his sacrifice of the uneaten\n      souffle, the still less eaten mushrooms, the peppermint sweet with which\n      he usually concluded dinner, seemed to consecrate that purpose. They all\n      thought he was a hulk, without a shot left in the locker! He had seen a\n      couple of them at the Board that afternoon shrugging at each other, as\n      though saying: 'Look at him!' And young Farney pitying him. Pity,\n      forsooth! And that coarse-grained solicitor chap at the creditors' meeting\n      curling his lip as much as to say: 'One foot in the grave!' He had seen\n      the clerks dowsing the glim of their grins; and that young pup Bob Pillin\n      screwing up his supercilious mug over his dog-collar. He knew that scented\n      humbug Rosamund was getting scared that he'd drop off before she'd\n      squeezed him dry. And his valet was always looking him up and down\n      queerly. As to that holy woman -- ! Not quite so fast! Not quite so\n      fast! And filling his glass for the fourth time, he slowly sucked down the\n      dark red fluid, with the \"old boots\" flavour which his soul loved, and,\n      drawing deep at his cigar, closed his eyes.",

                "The room in the hotel where the general meetings of \"The Island Navigation\n      Company\" were held was nearly full when the secretary came through the\n      door which as yet divided the shareholders from their directors. Having\n      surveyed their empty chairs, their ink and papers, and nodded to a\n      shareholder or two, he stood, watch in hand, contemplating the\n      congregation. A thicker attendance than he had ever seen! Due, no doubt,\n      to the lower dividend, and this Pillin business. And his tongue curled.\n      For if he had a natural contempt for his Board, with the exception of the\n      chairman, he had a still more natural contempt for his shareholders.\n      Amusing spectacle when you came to think of it, a general meeting! Unique!\n      Eighty or a hundred men, and five women, assembled through sheer devotion\n      to their money. Was any other function in the world so single-hearted.\n      Church was nothing to it -- so many motives were mingled there with\n      devotion to one's soul. A well-educated young man -- reader of Anatole\n      France, and other writers -- he enjoyed ironic speculation. What\n      earthly good did they think they got by coming here? Half-past two! He put\n      his watch back into his pocket, and passed into the Board-room.",
                "There, the fumes of lunch and of a short preliminary meeting made cosy the\n      February atmosphere. By the fire four directors were conversing rather\n      restlessly; the fifth was combing his beard; the chairman sat with eyes\n      closed and red lips moving rhythmically in the sucking of a lozenge, the\n      slips of his speech ready in his hand. The secretary said in his cheerful\n      voice: \"Time, sir.\"",
                "Old Heythorp swallowed, lifted his arms, rose with help, and walked\n      through to his place at the centre of the table. The five directors\n      followed. And, standing at the chairman's right, the secretary read the\n      minutes, forming the words precisely with his curling tongue. Then,\n      assisting the chairman to his feet, he watched those rows of faces, and\n      thought: 'Mistake to let them see he can't get up without help. He ought\n      to have let me read his speech -- I wrote it.'",
                "The chairman began to speak:",
                "\"It is my duty and my pleasure,' ladies and gentlemen, for the nineteenth\n      consecutive year to present to you the directors' report and the accounts\n      for the past twelve months. You will all have had special notice of a\n      measure of policy on which your Board has decided, and to which you will\n      be asked to-day to give your adherence -- to that I shall come at the\n      end of my remarks....\"",
                "\"Excuse me, sir; we can't hear a word down here.\"",
                "'Ah!' thought the secretary, 'I was expecting that.'",
                "The chairman went on, undisturbed. But several shareholders now rose, and\n      the same speaker said testily: \"We might as well go home. If the\n      chairman's got no voice, can't somebody read for him?\"",
                "The chairman took a sip of water, and resumed. Almost all in the last six\n      rows were now on their feet, and amid a hubbub of murmurs the chairman\n      held out to the secretary the slips of his speech, and fell heavily back\n      into his chair.",
                "The secretary re-read from the beginning; and as each sentence fell from\n      his tongue, he thought: 'How good that is!' 'That's very clear!' 'A neat\n      touch!' 'This is getting them.' It seemed to him a pity they could not\n      know it was all his composition. When at last he came to the Pillin sale\n      he paused for a second.",
                "\"I come now to the measure of policy to which I made allusion at the\n      beginning of my speech. Your Board has decided to expand your enterprise\n      by purchasing the entire fleet of Pillin & Co., Ltd. By this\n      transaction we become the owners of the four steamships Smyrna, Damascus,\n      Tyre, and Sidon, vessels in prime condition with a total freight-carrying\n      capacity of fifteen thousand tons, at the low inclusive price of sixty\n      thousand pounds. Gentlemen, de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!\" -- it\n      was the chairman's phrase, his bit of the speech, and the secretary did it\n      more than justice. \"Times are bad, but your Board is emphatically of the\n      opinion that they are touching bottom; and this, in their view, is the\n      psychological moment for a forward stroke. They confidently recommend your\n      adoption of their policy and the ratification of this purchase, which they\n      believe will, in the not far distant future, substantially increase the\n      profits of the Company.\" The secretary sat down with reluctance. The\n      speech should have continued with a number of appealing sentences which he\n      had carefully prepared, but the chairman had cut them out with the simple\n      comment: \"They ought to be glad of the chance.\" It was, in his view, an\n      error.",
                "The director who had combed his beard now rose -- a man of presence,\n      who might be trusted to say nothing long and suavely. While he was\n      speaking the secretary was busy noting whence opposition was likely to\n      come. The majority were sitting owl-like-a good sign; but some dozen were\n      studying their copies of the report, and three at least were making notes -- Westgate,\n      for, instance, who wanted to get on the Board, and was sure to make\n      himself unpleasant -- the time-honoured method of vinegar; and\n      Batterson, who also desired to come on, and might be trusted to support\n      the Board -- the time-honoured method of oil; while, if one knew\n      anything of human nature, the fellow who had complained that he might as\n      well go home would have something uncomfortable to say. The director\n      finished his remarks, combed his beard with his fingers, and sat down.",
                "A momentary pause ensued. Then Messieurs Westgate and Batterson rose\n      together. Seeing the chairman nod towards the latter, the secretary\n      thought: 'Mistake! He should have humoured Westgate by giving him\n      precedence.' But that was the worst of the old man, he had no notion of\n      the suaviter in modo! Mr. Batterson thus unchained -- would like, if he\n      might be so allowed, to congratulate the Board on having piloted their\n      ship so smoothly through the troublous waters of the past year. With their\n      worthy chairman still at the helm, he had no doubt that in spite of the\n      still low -- he would not say falling -- barometer, and\n      the-er-unseasonable climacteric, they might rely on weathering the -- er -- he\n      would not say storm. He would confess that the present dividend of four\n      per cent. was not one which satisfied every aspiration (Hear, hear!), but\n      speaking for himself, and he hoped for others -- and here Mr. Batterson\n      looked round -- he recognised that in all the circumstances it was as\n      much as they had the right -- er -- to expect. But following the\n      bold but to his mind prudent development which the Board proposed to make,\n      he thought that they might reasonably, if not sanguinely, anticipate a\n      more golden future. (\"No, no!\") A shareholder said, 'No, no!' That might\n      seem to indicate a certain lack of confidence in the special proposal\n      before the meeting. (\"Yes!\") From that lack of confidence he would like at\n      once to dissociate himself. Their chairman, a man of foresight and acumen,\n      and valour proved on many a field and -- er -- sea, would not have\n      committed himself to this policy without good reason. In his opinion they\n      were in safe hands, and he was glad to register his support of the measure\n      proposed. The chairman had well said in his speech: 'de l'audace, toujours\n      de l'audace!' Shareholders would agree with him that there could be no\n      better motto for Englishmen. Ahem!",
                "Mr. Batterson sat down. And Mr. Westgate rose: He wanted -- he said -- to\n      know more, much more, about this proposition, which to his mind was of a\n      very dubious wisdom.... 'Ah!' thought the secretary, 'I told the old boy\n      he must tell them more'.... To whom, for instance, had the proposal first\n      been made? To him! -- the chairman said. Good! But why were Pillins\n      selling, if freights were to go up, as they were told?",
                "\"Matter of opinion.\"",
                "\"Quite so; and in my opinion they are going lower, and Pillins were right\n      to sell. It follows that we are wrong to buy.\" (\"Hear, hear!\" \"No, no!\")\n      \"Pillins are shrewd people. What does the chairman say? Nerves! Does he\n      mean to tell us that this sale was the result of nerves?\"",
                "The chairman nodded.",
                "\"That appears to me a somewhat fantastic theory; but I will leave that and\n      confine myself to asking the grounds on which the chairman bases his\n      confidence; in fact, what it is which is actuating the Board in pressing\n      on us at such a time what I have no hesitation in stigmatising as a rash\n      proposal. In a word, I want light as well as leading in this matter.\"",
                "Mr. Westgate sat down.",
                "What would the chairman do now? The situation was distinctly awkward -- seeing\n      his helplessness and the lukewarmness of the Board behind him. And the\n      secretary felt more strongly than ever the absurdity of his being an\n      underling, he who in a few well-chosen words could so easily have twisted\n      the meeting round his thumb. Suddenly he heard the long, rumbling sigh\n      which preluded the chairman's speeches.",
                "\"Has any other gentleman anything to say before I move the adoption of the\n      report?\"",
                "Phew! That would put their backs up. Yes, sure enough it had brought that\n      fellow, who had said he might as well go home, to his feet! Now for\n      something nasty!",
                "\"Mr. Westgate requires answering. I don't like this business. I don't\n      impute anything to anybody; but it looks to me as if there were something\n      behind it which the shareholders ought to be told. Not only that; but, to\n      speak frankly, I'm not satisfied to be ridden over roughshod in this\n      fashion by one who, whatever he may have been in the past, is obviously\n      not now in the prime of his faculties.\"",
                "With a gasp the secretary thought: 'I knew that was a plain-spoken man!'",
                "He heard again the rumbling beside him. The chairman had gone crimson, his\n      mouth was pursed, his little eyes were very blue.",
                "\"Help me up,\" he said.",
                "The secretary helped him, and waited, rather breathless.",

                "He sank back into his seat. The secretary, stealing a glance, thought with\n      a sort of enthusiasm: 'Bravo! Who'd have thought he could rally his voice\n      like that? A good touch, too, that about his honour! I believe he's\n      knocked them.",
                "It's still dicky, though, if that fellow at the back gets up again; the\n      old chap can't work that stop a second time. 'Ah! here was 'old Apple-pie'\n      on his hind legs. That was all right!",
                "\"I do not hesitate to say that I am an old friend of the chairman; we are,\n      many of us, old friends of the chairman, and it has been painful to me,\n      and I doubt not to others, to hear an attack made on him. If he is old in\n      body, he is young in mental vigour and courage. I wish we were all as\n      young. We ought to stand by him; I say, we ought to stand by him.\" (\"Hear,\n      hear! Hear, hear!\") And the secretary thought: 'That's done it!' And he\n      felt a sudden odd emotion, watching the chairman bobbing his body, like a\n      wooden toy, at old Appleby; and old Appleby bobbing back. Then, seeing a\n      shareholder close to the door get up, thought: 'Who's that? I know his\n      face -- Ah! yes; Ventnor, the solicitor -- he's one of the\n      chairman's creditors that are coming again this afternoon. What now?'",
                "\"I can't agree that we ought to let sentiment interfere with our judgment\n      in this matter. The question is simply: How are our pockets going to be\n      affected? I came here with some misgivings, but the attitude of the\n      chairman has been such as to remove them; and I shall support the\n      proposition.\" The secretary thought: 'That's all right -- only, he said\n      it rather queerly -- rather queerly.'",
                "Then, after a long silence, the chairman, without rising, said:",

That chap at the back -- an ill-conditioned\n      fellow! \"Something behind!\" Suspicious brute! There was something -- but -- hang\n      it! they might think themselves lucky to get four ships at that price, and\n      all due to him! It was on the last speaker that his mind dwelt with a\n      doubt. That fellow Ventnor, to whom he owed money -- there had been\n      something just a little queer about his tone -- as much as to say, \"I\n      smell a rat.\" Well! one would see that at the creditors' meeting in half\n      an hour.",

                "\"Well,\" he said, \"you've got your way; you always do. Who is this Mrs.\n      Larne? You oughtn't to keep me in the dark. It seems my boy met her at\n      your house. You told me she didn't come there.\"",

                "Alone again, old Heythorp thought: 'By George! What a wavering, quavering,\n      thread paper of a fellow! What misery life must be to a chap like that! He\n      walks in fear -- he wallows in it. Poor devil!' And a curious feeling\n      swelled his heart, of elation, of lightness such as he had not known for\n      years. Those two young things were safe now from penury-safe! After\n      dealing with those infernal creditors of his he would go round and have a\n      look at the children. With a hundred and twenty a year the boy could go\n      into the Army -- best place for a young scamp like that. The girl would\n      go off like hot cakes, of course, but she needn't take the first calf that\n      came along. As for their mother, she must look after herself; nothing\n      under two thousand a year would keep her out of debt. But trust her for\n      wheedling and bluffing her way out of any scrape! Watching his cigar-smoke\n      curl and disperse he was conscious of the strain he had been under these\n      last six weeks, aware suddenly of how greatly he had baulked at thought of\n      to-day's general meeting. Yes! It might have turned out nasty. He knew\n      well enough the forces on the Board, and off, who would be only too glad\n      to shelve him. If he were shelved here his other two Companies would be\n      sure to follow suit, and bang would go every penny of his income -- he\n      would be a pauper dependant on that holy woman. Well! Safe now for another\n      year if he could stave off these sharks once more. It might be a harder\n      job this time, but he was in luck -- in luck, and it must hold. And\n      taking a luxurious pull at his cigar, he rang the handbell.",
                "\"Bring 'em in here, Mr. Farney. And let me have a cup of China tea as\n      strong as you can make it.\"",

                "The gentlemen, who numbered ten this time, bowed to their debtor,\n      evidently wondering why the deuce they troubled to be polite to an old man\n      who kept them out of their money. Then, the secretary reappearing with a\n      cup of China tea, they watched while their debtor drank it. The feat was\n      tremulous. Would he get through without spilling it all down his front, or\n      choking? To those unaccustomed to his private life it was slightly\n      miraculous. He put the cup down empty, tremblingly removed some yellow\n      drops from the little white tuft below his lip, refit his cigar, and said:",
                "\"No use beating about the bush, gentlemen; I can offer you fourteen\n      hundred a year so long as I live and hold my directorships, and not a\n      penny more.

                "In spite of business habits the surprise of the ten gentlemen was only\n      partially concealed.

                "\"Will you submit your pass books?\"",
                "\"No, but I'll authorise my bankers to give you a full statement of my\n      receipts for the last five years -- longer, if you like.\"",
                "The strategic stroke of placing the ten gentlemen round the Board table\n      had made it impossible for them to consult freely without being overheard,\n      but the low-voiced transference of thought travelling round was summed up\n      at last by Mr. Brownbee.",
                "\"We think, Mr. Heythorp, that your fees and dividends should enable you to\n      set aside for us a larger sum.

                "Old Heythorp shook his head. \"Nineteen hundred and thirty pounds in a good\n      year. Must eat and drink; must have a man to look after me not as active\n      as I was.

                "The others had risen and were gathered in a knot at the end of the table;\n      old Heythorp and Mr. Ventnor alone remained seated.

Well, do your worst!' The \"ugly dog\" rose abruptly and joined the\n      others.

Mark the scent of mimosa -- she\n      likes flowers, and likes them strong. No clock, of course. Examine the\n      bureau -- she is obviously always ringing for \"the drumstick,\" and\n      saying: \"Where's this, Ellen, and where's that?

See how she's had the electric light\n      put in, instead of that horrid gas; but try and turn either of them on -- you\n      can't; last quarter isn't paid, of course; and she uses an oil lamp, you\n      can tell that by the ceiling: The dog over there, who will not answer to\n      the name of 'Carmen,' a Pekinese spaniel like a little Djin, all prominent\n      eyes rolling their blacks, and no nose between -- yes, Carmen looks as\n      if she didn't know what was coming next; she's right -- it's a\n      pet-and-slap-again life!

                "\"What larks! And I suppose you had lots of adventures with opera dancers\n      and gambling. The young men are all so good now.\" Her eyes rested on Bob\n      Pillin. \"That young man's a perfect stick of goodness.\"",

                "\"He likes to pretend, of course, that he's fearfully lively. He's promised\n      to take mother and me to the theatre and supper afterwards. Won't it be\n      scrummy! Only, I haven't anything to go in.\"",
                "Old Heythorp said: \"What do you want? Irish poplin?\"",

This little house was a\n      rumty-too affair, her mother was a humbug, the boy a cheeky young rascal,\n      but there was a warmth here he never felt in that big house which had been\n      his wife's and was now his holy daughter's. And once more he rejoiced at\n      his day's work, and the success of his breach of trust, which put some\n      little ground beneath these young feet, in a hard and unscrupulous world.\n      Phyllis whispered in his ear:",
                "\"Guardy, do look; he will stare at me like that. Isn't it awful -- like\n      a boiled rabbit?\"",
                "Bob Pillin, attentive to Mrs. Larne, was gazing with all his might over\n      her shoulder at the girl. The young man was moonstruck, that was clear!\n      There was something almost touching in the stare of those puppy dog's\n      eyes. And he thought 'Young beggar -- wish I were his age!' The utter\n      injustice of having an old and helpless body, when your desire for\n      enjoyment was as great as ever! They said a man was as old as he felt!\n      Fools! A man was as old as his legs and arms, and not a day younger. He\n      heard the girl beside him utter a discomfortable sound, and saw her face\n      cloud as if tears were not far off; she jumped up, and going to the\n      window, lifted the little dog and buried her face in its brown and white\n      fur. Old Heythorp thought: 'She sees that her humbugging mother is using\n      her as a decoy.' But she had come back, and the little dog, rolling its\n      eyes horribly at the strange figure on the sofa, in a desperate effort to\n      escape succeeded in reaching her shoulder, where it stayed perched like a\n      cat, held by one paw and trying to back away into space. Old Heythorp said\n      abruptly:",

                "Thoroughly upset, Bob Pillin preserved a dogged silence. This fortnight,\n      since he had first met Phyllis in old Heythorp's hall, had been the most\n      singular of his existence up to now. He would never have believed that a\n      fellow could be so quickly and completely bowled, could succumb without a\n      kick, without even wanting to kick. To one with his philosophy of having a\n      good time and never committing himself too far, it was in the nature of \"a\n      fair knock-out,\" and yet so pleasurable, except for the wear and tear\n      about one's chances. If only he knew how far the old boy really counted in\n      the matter! To say: \"My intentions are strictly honourable\" would be\n      old-fashioned; besides -- the old fellow might have no right to hear\n      it.

Object to! That sleek head, those puppy-dog eyes,\n      fattish red cheeks, high collars, pearl pin, spats, and drawl-pah! the\n      imbecility, the smugness of his mug; no go, no devil in any of his sort,\n      in any of these fish-veined, coddled-up young bloods, nothing but playing\n      for safety!

That\n      this paralytic old fellow should express contempt for his virility was\n      really the last thing in jests. Luckily he could not take it seriously.\n      But suddenly he thought: 'What if he really has the power to stop my going\n      there, and means to turn them against me!' And his heart quailed.",

It was wonderfully still\n      there every day at this hour; just the click of the coals, just the\n      faintest ruffle from the wind in the trees of the park. And it was cosily\n      warm, only the fire lightening the darkness. A drowsy beatitude pervaded\n      the old man. A good day's work! A triumph -- that young pup had said.\n      Yes! Something of a triumph! He had held on, and won. And dinner to look\n      forward to, yet. A nap -- a nap! And soon, rhythmic, soft, sonorous,\n      his breathing rose, with now and then that pathetic twitching of the old\n      who dream.",
                "III",
                "1",
                "When Bob Pillin emerged from the little front garden of 23, Millicent\n      Villas ten days later, his sentiments were ravelled, and he could not get\n      hold of an end to pull straight the stuff of his mind.",
                "He had found Mrs. Larne and Phyllis in the sitting-room, and Phyllis had\n      been crying; he was sure she had been crying; and that memory still\n      infected the sentiments evoked by later happenings. Old Heythorp had said:\n      \"You'll burn your fingers.\" The process had begun. Having sent her\n      daughter away on a pretext really a bit too thin, Mrs. Larne had installed\n      him beside her scented bulk on the sofa, and poured into his ear such a\n      tale of monetary woe and entanglement, such a mass of present difficulties\n      and rosy prospects, that his brain still whirled, and only one thing\n      emerged clearly-that she wanted fifty pounds, which she would repay him on\n      quarter-day; for their Guardy had made a settlement by which, until the\n      dear children came of age, she would have sixty pounds every quarter. It\n      was only a question of a few weeks; he might ask Messrs. Scriven and\n      Coles; they would tell him the security was quite safe. He certainly might\n      ask Messrs. Scriven and Coles -- they happened to be his father's\n      solicitors; but it hardly seemed to touch the point. Bob Pillin had a\n      certain shrewd caution, and the point was whether he was going to begin to\n      lend money to a woman who, he could see, might borrow up to seventy times\n      seven on the strength of his infatuation for her daughter. That was rather\n      too strong! Yet, if he didn't she might take a sudden dislike to him, and\n      where would he be then? Besides, would not a loan make his position\n      stronger? And then -- such is the effect of love even on the younger\n      generation -- that thought seemed to him unworthy. If he lent at all,\n      it should be from chivalry -- ulterior motives might go hang! And the\n      memory of the tear-marks on Phyllis's pretty pale-pink cheeks; and her\n      petulantly mournful: \"Oh! young man, isn't money beastly!\" scraped his\n      heart, and ravished his judgment. All the same, fifty pounds was fifty\n      pounds, and goodness knew how much more; and what did he know of Mrs.\n      Larne, after all, except that she was a relative of old Heythorp's and\n      wrote stories -- told them too, if he was not mistaken? Perhaps it\n      would be better to see Scrivens'. But again that absurd nobility assaulted\n      him. Phyllis! Phyllis! Besides, were not settlements always drawn so that\n      they refused to form security for anything? Thus, hampered and troubled,\n      he hailed a cab. He was dining with the Ventnors on the Cheshire side, and\n      would be late if he didn't get home sharp to dress.",
                "Driving, white-tied -- and waist-coated, in his father's car, he\n      thought with a certain contumely of the younger Ventnor girl, whom he had\n      been wont to consider pretty before he knew Phyllis. And seated next her\n      at dinner, he quite enjoyed his new sense of superiority to her charms,\n      and the ease with which he could chaff and be agreeable. And all the time\n      he suffered from the suppressed longing which scarcely ever left him now,\n      to think and talk of Phyllis. Ventnor's fizz was good and plentiful, his\n      old Madeira absolutely first chop, and the only other man present a\n      teetotal curate, who withdrew with the ladies to talk his parish shop.\n      Favoured by these circumstances, and the perception that Ventnor was an\n      agreeable fellow, Bob Pillin yielded to his secret itch to get near the\n      subject of his affections.",
                "\"Do you happen,\" he said airily, \"to know a Mrs. Larne -- relative of\n      old Heythorp's -- rather a handsome woman-she writes stories.\"",

                "Mr. Ventnor smiled. \"Ah!\" he said enigmatically, \"these lady novelists!\n      Does she make any money by them?\"",
                "Bob Pillin knew that to make money by writing meant success, but that not\n      to make money by writing was artistic, and implied that you had private\n      means, which perhaps was even more distinguished. And he said:",
                "\"Oh! she has private means, I know.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor reached for the Madeira.",
                "\"So she's a relative of old Heythorp's,\" he said. \"He's a very old friend\n      of your father's. He ought to go bankrupt, you know.\"",
                "To Bob Pillin, glowing with passion and Madeira, the idea of bankruptcy\n      seemed discreditable in connection with a relative of Phyllis. Besides,\n      the old boy was far from that! Had he not just made this settlement on\n      Mrs. Larne? And he said:",
                "\"I think you're mistaken. That's of the past.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor smiled.",
                "\"Will you bet?\" he said.",
                "Bob Pillin also smiled. \"I should be bettin' on a certainty.\"",

                "\"No, my boy,\" he said. \"No!\"",

Always been sorry he didn't come to me. Shall\n      we join the ladies?\" And to the drawing-room he preceded a young man more\n      uncertain in his mind than on his feet....",
                "Charles Ventnor was not one to let you see that more was going on within\n      than met the eye. But there was a good deal going on that evening, and\n      after his conversation with young Bob he had occasion more than once to\n      turn away and rub his hands together. When, after that second creditors'\n      meeting, he had walked down the stairway which led to the offices of \"The\n      Island Navigation Company,\" he had been deep in thought. Short, squarely\n      built, rather stout, with moustache and large mutton-chop whiskers of a\n      red brown, and a faint floridity in face and dress, he impressed at first\n      sight only by a certain truly British vulgarity. One felt that here was a\n      hail-fellow -- well-met man who liked lunch and dinner, went to\n      Scarborough for his summer holidays, sat on his wife, took his daughters\n      out in a boat and was never sick. One felt that he went to church every\n      Sunday morning, looked upwards as he moved through life, disliked the\n      unsuccessful, and expanded with his second glass of wine. But then a clear\n      look into his well-clothed face and red-brown eyes would give the feeling:\n      'There's something fulvous here; he might be a bit too foxy.' A third look\n      brought the thought: 'He's certainly a bully.' He was not a large creditor\n      of old Heythorp. With interest on the original, he calculated his claim at\n      three hundred pounds -- unredeemed shares in that old Ecuador mine. But\n      he had waited for his money eight years, and could never imagine how it\n      came about that he had been induced to wait so long. There had been, of\n      course, for one who liked \"big pots,\" a certain glamour about the\n      personality of old Heythorp, still a bit of a swell in shipping circles,\n      and a bit of an aristocrat in Liverpool. But during the last year Charles\n      Ventnor had realised that the old chap's star had definitely set -- when\n      that happens, of course, there is no more glamour, and the time has come\n      to get your money. Weakness in oneself and others is despicable! Besides,\n      he had food for thought, and descending the stairs he chewed it: He smelt\n      a rat -- creatures for which both by nature and profession he had a\n      nose. Through Bob Pillin, on whom he sometimes dwelt in connection with\n      his younger daughter, he knew that old Pillin and old Heythorp had been\n      friends for thirty years and more. That, to an astute mind, suggested\n      something behind this sale. The thought had already occurred to him when\n      he read his copy of the report. A commission would be a breach of trust,\n      of course, but there were ways of doing things; the old chap was devilish\n      hard pressed, and human nature was human nature! His lawyerish mind\n      habitually put two and two together. The old fellow had deliberately\n      appointed to meet his creditors again just after the general meeting which\n      would decide the purchase -- had said he might do something for them\n      then. Had that no significance?",
                "In these circumstances Charles Ventnor had come to the meeting with eyes\n      wide open and mouth tight closed. And he had watched. It was certainly\n      remarkable that such an old and feeble man, with no neck at all, who\n      looked indeed as if he might go off with apoplexy any moment, should\n      actually say that he \"stood or fell\" by this purchase, knowing that if he\n      fell he would be a beggar. Why should the old chap be so keen on getting\n      it through? It would do him personally no good, unless -- Exactly! He\n      had left the meeting, therefore, secretly confident that old Heythorp had\n      got something out of this transaction which would enable him to make a\n      substantial proposal to his creditors. So that when the old man had\n      declared that he was going to make none, something had turned sour in his\n      heart, and he had said to himself: \"All right, you old rascal! You don't\n      know C. V.\" The cavalier manner of that beggarly old rip, the defiant look\n      of his deep little eyes, had put a polish on the rancour of one who prided\n      himself on letting no man get the better of him. All that evening, seated\n      on one side of the fire, while Mrs. Ventnor sat on the other, and the\n      younger daughter played Gounod's Serenade on the violin -- he\n      cogitated. And now and again he smiled, but not too much. He did not see\n      his way as yet, but had little doubt that before long he would. It would\n      not be hard to knock that chipped old idol off his perch. There was\n      already a healthy feeling among the shareholders that he was past work and\n      should be scrapped. The old chap should find that Charles V. was not to be\n      defied; that when he got his teeth into a thing, he did not let it go. By\n      hook or crook he would have the old man off his Boards, or his debt out of\n      him as the price of leaving him alone. His life or his money -- and the\n      old fellow should determine which. With the memory of that defiance fresh\n      within him, he almost hoped it might come to be the first, and turning to\n      Mrs. Ventnor, he said abruptly:",
                "\"Have a little dinner Friday week, and ask young Pillin and the curate.\"\n       He specified the curate, a tee-totaller, because he had two daughters, and\n      males and females must be paired, but he intended to pack him off after\n      dinner to the drawing-room to discuss parish matters while he and Bob\n      Pillin sat over their wine. What he expected to get out of the young man\n      he did not as yet know.",
                "On the day of the dinner, before departing for the office, he had gone to\n      his cellar. Would three bottles of Perrier Jouet do the trick, or must he\n      add one of the old Madeira? He decided to be on the safe side. A bottle or\n      so of champagne went very little way with him personally, and young Pillin\n      might be another.",
                "The Madeira having done its work by turning the conversation into such an\n      admirable channel, he had cut it short for fear young Pillin might drink\n      the lot or get wind of the rat. And when his guests were gone, and his\n      family had retired, he stood staring into the fire, putting together the\n      pieces of the puzzle. Five or six thousand pounds -- six would be ten\n      per cent. on sixty! Exactly! Scrivens -- young Pillin had said! But\n      Crow & Donkin, not Scriven & Coles, were old Heythorp's\n      solicitors. What could that mean, save that the old man wanted to cover\n      the tracks of a secret commission, and had handled the matter through\n      solicitors who did not know the state of his affairs! But why Pillin's\n      solicitors? With this sale just going through, it must look deuced fishy\n      to them too. Was it all a mare's nest, after all? In such circumstances he\n      himself would have taken the matter to a London firm who knew nothing of\n      anybody. Puzzled, therefore, and rather disheartened, feeling too that\n      touch of liver which was wont to follow his old Madeira, he went up to bed\n      and woke his wife to ask her why the dickens they couldn't always have\n      soup like that!",
                "Next day he continued to brood over his puzzle, and no fresh light came;\n      but having a matter on which his firm and Scrivens' were in touch, he\n      decided to go over in person, and see if he could surprise something out\n      of them. Feeling, from experience, that any really delicate matter would\n      only be entrusted to the most responsible member of the firm, he had asked\n      to see Scriven himself, and just as he had taken his hat to go, he said\n      casually:",
                "\"By the way, you do some business for old Mr. Heythorp, don't you?\"",
                "Scriven, raising his eyebrows a little, murmured: \"Er -- no,\" in\n      exactly the tone Mr. Ventnor himself used when he wished to imply that\n      though he didn't as a fact do business, he probably soon would. He knew\n      therefore that the answer was a true one. And non-plussed, he hazarded:",
                "\"Oh! I thought you did, in regard to a Mrs. Larne.\"",
                "This time he had certainly drawn blood of sorts, for down came Scriven's\n      eyebrows, and he said:",
                "\"Mrs. Larne -- we know a Mrs. Larne, but not in that connection. Why?\"",
                "\"Oh! Young Pillin told me -- \"",
                "\"Young Pillin? Why, it's his -- -!\" A little pause, and then: \"Old Mr.\n      Heythorp's solicitors are Crow & Donkin, I believe.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor held out his hand. \"Yes, yes,\" he said; \"goodbye. Glad to have\n      got that matter settled up,\" and out he went, and down the street,\n      important, smiling. By George! He had got it! \"It's his father\" -- Scriven\n      had been going to say. What a plant! Exactly! Oh! neat! Old Pillin had\n      made the settlement direct; and the solicitors were in the dark; that\n      disposed of his difficulty about them. No money had passed between old\n      Pillin and old Heythorp not a penny. Oh! neat! But not neat enough for\n      Charles Ventnor, who had that nose for rats. Then his smile died, and with\n      a little chill he perceived that it was all based on supposition -- not\n      quite good enough to go on! What then? Somehow he must see this Mrs.\n      Larne, or better -- old Pillin himself. The point to ascertain was\n      whether she had any connection of her own with Pillin. Clearly young\n      Pillin didn't know of it; for, according to him, old Heythorp had made the\n      settlement. By Jove! That old rascal was deep -- all the more\n      satisfaction in proving that he was not as deep as C. V. To unmask the old\n      cheat was already beginning to seem in the nature of a public service. But\n      on what pretext could he visit Pillin? A subscription to the Windeatt\n      almshouses! That would make him talk in self-defence and he would take\n      care not to press the request to the actual point of getting a\n      subscription. He caused himself to be driven to the Pillin residence in\n      Sefton Park. Ushered into a room on the ground floor, heated in American\n      fashion, Mr. Ventnor unbuttoned his coat. A man of sanguine constitution,\n      he found this hot-house atmosphere a little trying. And having\n      sympathetically obtained Joe Pillin's reluctant refusal -- Quite so!\n      One could not indefinitely extend one's subscriptions even for the best of\n      causes! -- he said gently:",
                "\"By the way, you know Mrs. Larne, don't you?\"",
                "The effect of that simple shot surpassed his highest hopes. Joe Pillin's\n      face, never highly coloured, turned a sort of grey; he opened his thin\n      lips, shut them quickly, as birds do, and something seemed to pass with\n      difficulty down his scraggy throat. The hollows, which nerve exhaustion\n      delves in the cheeks of men whose cheekbones are not high, increased\n      alarmingly. For a moment he looked deathly; then, moistening his lips, he\n      said:",
                "\"Larne -- Larne? No, I don't seem -- -\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor, who had taken care to be drawing on his gloves, murmured:",
                "\"Oh! I thought -- your son knows her; a relation of old Heythorp's,\"\n       and he looked up.",
                "Joe Pillin had his handkerchief to his mouth; he coughed feebly, then with\n      more and more vigour:",
                "\"I'm in very poor health,\" he said, at last. \"I'm getting abroad at once.\n      This cold's killing me. What name did you say?\" And he remained with his\n      handkerchief against his teeth.",
                "Mr. Ventnor repeated:",
                "\"Larne. Writes stories.\"",
                "Joe Pillin muttered into his handkerchief",
                "\"Ali! H'm! No -- I -- no! My son knows all sorts of people. I shall\n      have to try Mentone. Are you going? Good-bye! Good-bye! I'm sorry; ah! ha!\n      My cough -- ah! ha h'h'.! Very distressing. Ye-hes! My cough-ah! ha\n      h'h'.! Most distressing. Ye-hes!\"",
                "Out in the drive Mr. Ventnor took a deep breath of the frosty air. Not\n      much doubt now! The two names had worked like charms. This weakly old\n      fellow would make a pretty witness, would simply crumple under\n      cross-examination. What a contrast to that hoary old sinner Heythorp,\n      whose brazenness nothing could affect. The rat was as large as life! And\n      the only point was how to make the best use of it. Then -- for his\n      experience was wide -- the possibility dawned on him, that after all,\n      this Mrs. Larne might only have been old Pillin's mistress -- or be his\n      natural daughter, or have some other blackmailing hold on him. Any such\n      connection would account for his agitation, for his denying her, for his\n      son's ignorance. Only it wouldn't account for young Pillin's saying that\n      old Heythorp had made the settlement. He could only have got that from the\n      woman herself. Still, to make absolutely sure, he had better try and see\n      her. But how? It would never do to ask Bob Pillin for an introduction,\n      after this interview with his father. He would have to go on his own and\n      chance it. Wrote stories did she? Perhaps a newspaper would know her\n      address; or the Directory would give it -- not a common name! And, hot\n      on the scent, he drove to a post office. Yes, there it was, right enough!\n      \"Larne, Mrs. R., 23, Millicent Villas.\" And thinking to himself: 'No time\n      like the present,' he turned in that direction. The job was delicate. He\n      must be careful not to do anything which might compromise his power of\n      making public use of his knowledge. Yes-ticklish! What he did now must\n      have a proper legal bottom. Still, anyway you looked at it, he had a right\n      to investigate a fraud on himself as a shareholder of \"The Island\n      Navigation Company,\" and a fraud on himself as a creditor of old Heythorp.\n      Quite! But suppose this Mrs. Larne was really entangled with old Pillin,\n      and the settlement a mere reward of virtue, easy or otherwise. Well! in\n      that case there'd be no secret commission to make public, and he needn't\n      go further. So that, in either event, he would be all right. Only -- how\n      to introduce himself? He might pretend he was a newspaper man wanting a\n      story. No, that wouldn't do! He must not represent that he was what he was\n      not, in case he had afterwards to justify his actions publicly, always a\n      difficult thing, if you were not careful! At that moment there came into\n      his mind a question Bob Pillin had asked the other night. \"By the way, you\n      can't borrow on a settlement, can you? Isn't there generally some clause\n      against it?\" Had this woman been trying to borrow from him on that\n      settlement? But at this moment he reached the house, and got out of his\n      cab still undecided as to how he was going to work the oracle. Impudence,\n      constitutional and professional, sustained him in saying to the little\n      maid:",
                "\"Mrs. Larne at home? Say Mr. Charles Ventnor, will you?\"",
                "His quick brown eyes took in the apparel of the passage which served for\n      hall -- the deep blue paper on the walls, lilac-patterned curtains over\n      the doors, the well-known print of a nude young woman looking over her\n      shoulder, and he thought: 'H'm! Distinctly tasty!' They noted, too, a\n      small brown-and-white dog cowering in terror at the very end of the\n      passage, and he murmured affably: \"Fluffy! Come here, Fluffy!\" till\n      Carmen's teeth chattered in her head.",
                "\"Will you come in, sir?\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor ran his hand over his whiskers, and, entering a room, was\n      impressed at once by its air of domesticity. On a sofa a handsome woman\n      and a pretty young girl were surrounded by sewing apparatus and some white\n      material. The girl looked up, but the elder lady rose.",
                "Mr. Ventnor said easily",
                "\"You know my young friend, Mr. Robert Pillin, I think.\"",
                "The lady, whose bulk and bloom struck him to the point of admiration,\n      murmured in a full, sweet drawl:",
                "\"Oh! Ye-es. Are you from Messrs. Scrivens?\"",
                "With the swift reflection: 'As I thought!' Mr. Ventnor answered:",
                "\"Er -- not exactly. I am a solicitor though; came just to ask about a\n      certain settlement that Mr. Pillin tells me you're entitled under.\"",
                "\"Phyllis dear!\"",
                "Seeing the girl about to rise from underneath the white stuff, Mr. Ventnor\n      said quickly:",
                "\"Pray don't disturb yourself -- just a formality!\" It had struck him at\n      once that the lady would have to speak the truth in the presence of this\n      third party, and he went on: \"Quite recent, I think. This'll be your first\n      interest-on six thousand pounds? Is that right?\" And at the limpid assent\n      of that rich, sweet voice, he thought: 'Fine woman; what eyes!'",
                "\"Thank you; that's quite enough. I can go to Scrivens for any detail. Nice\n      young fellow, Bob Pillin, isn't he?\" He saw the girl's chin tilt, and Mrs.\n      Larne's full mouth curling in a smile.",
                "\"Delightful young man; we're very fond of him.\"",
                "And he proceeded:",
                "\"I'm quite an old friend of his; have you known him long?\"",
                "\"Oh! no. How long, Phyllis, since we met him at Guardy's? About a month.\n      But he's so unaffected -- quite at home with us. A nice fellow.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor murmured:",
                "\"Very different from his father, isn't he?\"",
                "\"Is he? We don't know his father; he's a shipowner, I think.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor rubbed his hands: \"Ye-es,\" he said, \"just giving up -- a\n      warm man. Young Pillin's a lucky fellow -- only son. So you met him at\n      old Mr. Heythorp's. I know him too -- relation of yours, I believe.\"",
                "\"Our dear Guardy such a wonderful man.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor echoed: \"Wonderful -- regular old Roman.\"",
                "\"Oh! but he's so kind!\" Mrs. Larne lifted the white stuff: \"Look what he's\n      given this naughty gairl!\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor murmured: \"Charming! Charming! Bob Pillin said, I think, that\n      Mr. Heythorp was your settlor.\"",
                "One of those little clouds which visit the brows of women who have owed\n      money in their time passed swiftly athwart Mrs. Larne's eyes. For a moment\n      they seemed saying: 'Don't you want to know too much?' Then they slid from\n      under it.",
                "\"Won't you sit down?\" she said. \"You must forgive our being at work.\"",
                "Mr. Ventnor, who had need of sorting his impressions, shook his head.",
                "\"Thank you; I must be getting on. Then Messrs. Scriven can -- a mere\n      formality! Goodbye! Good-bye, Miss Larne. I'm sure the dress will be most\n      becoming.\"",
                "And with memories of a too clear look from the girl's eyes, of a warm firm\n      pressure from the woman's hand, Mr. Ventnor backed towards the door and\n      passed away just in time to avoid hearing in two voices:",
                "\"What a nice lawyer!\"",
                "\"What a horrid man!\"",
                "Back in his cab, he continued to rub his hands. No, she didn't know old\n      Pillin! That was certain; not from her words, but from her face. She\n      wanted to know him, or about him, anyway. She was trying to hook young Bob\n      for that sprig of a girl -- it was clear as mud. H'm! it would astonish\n      his young friend to hear that he had called. Well, let it! And a curious\n      mixture of emotions beset Mr. Ventnor. He saw the whole thing now so\n      plainly, and really could not refrain from a certain admiration. The law\n      had been properly diddled! There was nothing to prevent a man from\n      settling money on a woman he had never seen; and so old Pillin's\n      settlement could probably not be upset. But old Heythorp could. It was\n      neat, though, oh! neat! And that was a fine woman -- remarkably! He had\n      a sort of feeling that if only the settlement had been in danger, it might\n      have been worth while to have made a bargain -- a woman like that could\n      have made it worth while! And he believed her quite capable of\n      entertaining the proposition! Her eye! Pity -- quite a pity! Mrs.\n      Ventnor was not a wife who satisfied every aspiration. But alas! the\n      settlement was safe. This baulking of the sentiment of love, whipped up,\n      if anything, the longing for justice in Mr. Ventnor. That old chap should\n      feel his teeth now. As a piece of investigation it was not so bad -- not\n      so bad at all! He had had a bit of luck, of course, -- no, not luck -- just\n      that knack of doing the right thing at the right moment which marks a real\n      genius for affairs.",
                "But getting into his train to return to Mrs. Ventnor, he thought: 'A woman\n      like that would have been -- !' And he sighed.",

Chivalry had won the day. And he rang the bell with an elation\n      which astonished him, for he knew he was doing a soft thing.",

Never till this last month had he really doubted his own face; but\n      now he wanted for it things he had never wanted. It had too much flesh and\n      colour. It did not reflect his passion. This was a handicap. With a narrow\n      white piping round his waistcoat opening, and a buttonhole of tuberoses,\n      he had tried to repair its deficiencies. But do what he would, he was\n      never easy about himself nowadays, never up to that pitch which could make\n      him confident in her presence. And until this month to lack confidence had\n      never been his wont. A clear, high, mocking voice said:",

Instead, he\n      sat very rigid at his end of the sofa, while she sat lax and lissom at the\n      other, and one of those crises of paralysis which beset would-be lovers\n      fixed him to the soul.",

Alas! such intrusions lasted but a moment before a blast\n      of awe and chivalry withered them, and a strange and tragic delicacy -- like\n      nothing he had ever known -- resumed its sway.

                "There are men whom a really bad bit of news at once stampedes out of all\n      power of coherent thought and action, and men who at first simply do not\n      take it in. Old Heythorp took it in fast enough; coming from a lawyer it\n      was about as nasty as it could be. But, at once, with stoic wariness his\n      old brain began casting round. What did this fellow really know? And what\n      exactly could he do? One thing was certain; even if he knew everything, he\n      couldn't upset that settlement. The youngsters were all right. The old man\n      grasped the fact that only his own position was at stake. But this was\n      enough in all conscience; a name which had been before the public fifty\n      odd years -- income, independence, more perhaps. It would take little,\n      seeing his age and feebleness, to make his Companies throw him over. But\n      what had the fellow got hold of? How decide whether or no to take notice;\n      to let him do his worst, or try and get into touch with him? And what was\n      the fellow's motive? He held ten shares! That would never make a man take\n      all this trouble, and over a purchase which was really first-rate business\n      for the Company. Yes! His conscience was quite clean. He had not betrayed\n      his Company -- on the contrary, had done it a good turn, got them four\n      sound ships at a low price -- against much opposition. That he might\n      have done the Company a better turn, and got the ships at fifty-four\n      thousand, did not trouble him -- the six thousand was a deuced sight\n      better employed; and he had not pocketed a penny piece himself! But the\n      fellow's motive? Spite? Looked like it. Spite, because he had been\n      disappointed of his money, and defied into the bargain! H'm! If that were\n      so, he might still be got to blow cold again. His eyes lighted on the pink\n      note with the blue forget-me-not.

On the other hand, three hundred pounds was money; and, if\n      old Heythorp were to say to him: \"What do you want to make this fuss for -- here's\n      what I owe you!\" could a man of business and the world let his sense of\n      justice -- however he might itch to have it satisfied -- stand in\n      the way of what was after all also his sense of Justice? -- for this\n      money had been owing to him for the deuce of along time.

It was done to a turn; and he was a ruined man. If only -- oh!\n      if only he could have seized the fellow by the neck and pitched him out of\n      the room! To have lived to be so spoken to; to have been unable to lift\n      hand or foot, hardly even his voice -- he would sooner have been dead!\n      Yes -- sooner have been dead! A dumb and measureless commotion was\n      still at work in the recesses of that thick old body, silver-brown in the\n      dark water, whose steam he drew deep into his wheezing lungs, as though\n      for spiritual relief. To be beaten by a cur like that! To have that common\n      cad of a pettifogging lawyer drag him down and kick him about; tumble a\n      name which had stood high, in the dust! The fellow had the power to make\n      him a byword and a beggar! It was incredible! But it was a fact. And\n      to-morrow he would begin to do it -- perhaps had begun already. His\n      tree had come down with a crash! Eighty years-eighty good years! He\n      regretted none of them-regretted nothing; least of all this breach of\n      trust which had provided for his grandchildren -- one of the best\n      things he had ever done. The fellow was a cowardly hound, too! The way he\n      had snatched the bell-pull out of his reach-despicable cur! And a chap\n      like that was to put \"paid\" to the account of Sylvanus Heythorp, to\n      \"scratch\" him out of life -- so near the end of everything, the very\n      end! His hand raised above the surface fell back on his stomach through\n      the dark water, and a bubble or two rose. Not so fast -- not so fast!\n      He had but to slip down a foot, let the water close over his head, and\n      \"Good-bye\" to Master Ventnor's triumph Dead men could not be kicked off\n      the Boards of Companies. Dead men could not be beggared, deprived of their\n      independence. He smiled and stirred a little in the bath till the water\n      reached the white hairs on his lower lip. It smelt nice! And he took a\n      long sniff: He had had a good life, a good life! And with the thought that\n      he had it in his power at any moment to put Master Ventnor's nose out of\n      joint -- to beat the beggar after all, a sense of assuagement and\n      well-being crept over him. His blood ran more evenly again. He closed his\n      eyes. They talked about an after-life -- people like that holy woman.\n      Gammon! You went to sleep -- a long sleep; no dreams. A nap after\n      dinner! Dinner! His tongue sought his palate! Yes! he could eat a good\n      dinner! That dog hadn't put him off his stroke! The best dinner he had\n      ever eaten was the one he gave to Jack Herring, Chichester, Thornworthy,\n      Nick Treffry and Jolyon Forsyte at Pole's. Good Lord! In 'sixty -- yes -- 'sixty-five?\n      Just before he fell in love with Alice Larne -- ten years before he\n      came to Liverpool. That was a dinner! Cost twenty-four pounds for the six\n      of them -- and Forsyte an absurdly moderate fellow. Only Nick Treff'ry\n      and himself had been three-bottle men! Dead! Every jack man of them.

                "\"All right; I'll get out. Evening clothes.\"",
                "And Meller, taking out dress suit and shirt, thought: 'Now, what does the\n      old bloomer want dressin' up again for; why can't he go to bed and have\n      his dinner there? When a man's like a baby, the cradle's the place for\n      him.'....",
                "An hour later, at the scene of his encounter with Mr. Ventnor, where the\n      table was already laid for dinner, old Heythorp stood and gazed. The\n      curtains had been drawn back, the window thrown open to air the room, and\n      he could see out there the shapes of the dark trees and a sky\n      grape-coloured, in the mild, moist night. It smelt good. A sensuous\n      feeling stirred in him, warm from his bath, clothed from head to foot in\n      fresh garments. Deuce of a time since he had dined in full fig! He would\n      have liked a woman dining opposite -- but not the holy woman; no, by\n      George! -- would have liked to see light falling on a woman's shoulders\n      once again, and a pair of bright eyes! He crossed, snail-like, towards the\n      fire. There that bullying fellow had stood with his back to it -- confound\n      his impudence! -- as if the place belonged to him. And suddenly he had\n      a vision of his three secretaries' faces -- especially young Farney's\n      as they would look, when the pack got him by the throat and pulled him\n      down. His co-directors, too! Old Heythorp! How are the mighty fallen! And\n      that hound jubilant!",
                "His valet passed across the room to shut the window and draw the curtains.\n      This chap too! The day he could no longer pay his wages, and had lost the\n      power to say \"Shan't want your services any more\" -- when he could no\n      longer even pay his doctor for doing his best to kill him off! Power,\n      interest, independence, all -- gone! To be dressed and undressed, given\n      pap, like a baby in arms, served as they chose to serve him, and wished\n      out of the way -- broken, dishonoured!",
                "By money alone an old man had his being! Meat, drink, movement, breath!\n      When all his money was gone the holy woman would let him know it fast\n      enough. They would all let him know it; or if they didn't, it would be out\n      of pity! He had never been pitied yet -- thank God! And he said:",
                "\"Get me up a bottle of Perrier Jouet. What's the menu?\"",
                "\"Germane soup, sir; filly de sole; sweetbread; cutlet soubees, rum\n      souffly.\"",
                "\"Tell her to give me a hors d'oeuvre, and put on a savoury.\"",
                "\"Yes, sir.\"",
                "When the man had gone, he thought: 'I should have liked an oyster -- too\n      late now!' and going over to his bureau, he fumblingly pulled out the top\n      drawer. There was little in it -- Just a few papers, business papers on\n      his Companies, and a schedule of his debts; not even a copy of his will -- he\n      had not made one, nothing to leave! Letters he had never kept. Half a\n      dozen bills, a few receipts, and the little pink note with the blue\n      forget-me-not. That was the lot! An old tree gives up bearing leaves, and\n      its roots dry up, before it comes down in a wind; an old man's world\n      slowly falls away from him till he stands alone in the night. Looking at\n      the pink note, he thought: 'Suppose I'd married Alice -- a man never\n      had a better mistress!' He fumbled the drawer to; but still he strayed\n      feebly about the room, with a curious shrinking from sitting down, legacy\n      from the quarter of an hour he had been compelled to sit while that hound\n      worried at his throat. He was opposite one of the pictures now. It\n      gleamed, dark and oily, limning a Scots Grey who had mounted a wounded\n      Russian on his horse, and was bringing him back prisoner from the\n      Balaclava charge. A very old friend -- bought in 'fifty-nine. It had\n      hung in his chambers in the Albany -- hung with him ever since. With\n      whom would it hang when he was gone? For that holy woman would scrap it,\n      to a certainty, and stick up some Crucifixion or other, some new-fangled\n      high art thing! She could even do that now if she liked -- for she\n      owned it, owned every mortal stick in the room, to the very glass he would\n      drink his champagne from; all made over under the settlement fifteen years\n      ago, before his last big gamble went wrong. \"De l'audace, toujours de\n      l'audace!\" The gamble which had brought him down till his throat at last\n      was at the mercy of a bullying hound. The pitcher and the well! At the\n      mercy -- -! The sound of a popping cork dragged him from reverie. He\n      moved to his seat, back to the window, and sat down to his dinner. By\n      George! They had got him an oyster! And he said:",
                "\"I've forgotten my teeth!\"",
                "While the man was gone for them, he swallowed the oysters, methodically\n      touching them one by one with cayenne, Chili vinegar, and lemon. Ummm! Not\n      quite what they used to be at Pimm's in the best days, but not bad -- not\n      bad! Then seeing the little blue bowl lying before him, he looked up and\n      said:",
                "\"My compliments to cook on the oysters. Give me the champagne.\" And he\n      lifted his trembling teeth. Thank God, he could still put 'em in for\n      himself! The creaming goldenish fluid from the napkined bottle slowly\n      reached the brim of his glass, which had a hollow stem; raising it to his\n      lips, very red between the white hairs above and below, he drank with a\n      gurgling noise, and put the glass down-empty. Nectar! And just cold\n      enough!",
                "\"I frapped it the least bit, sir.\"",
                "\"Quite right. What's that smell of flowers?\"",
                "\"It's from those 'yacinths on the sideboard, sir. They come from Mrs.\n      Larne, this afternoon.\"",
                "\"Put 'em on the table. Where's my daughter?\"",
                "\"She's had dinner, sir; goin' to a ball, I think.\"",
                "\"A ball!\"",
                "\"Charity ball, I fancy, sir.\"",
                "\"Ummm! Give me a touch of the old sherry with the soup.\"",
                "\"Yes, sir. I shall have to open a bottle:\"",
                "\"Very well, then, do!\"",
                "On his way to the cellar the man confided to Molly, who was carrying the\n      soup:",
                "\"The Gov'nor's going it to-night! What he'll be like tomorrow I dunno.\"",
                "The girl answered softly:",
                "\"Poor old man, let um have his pleasure.\" And, in the hall, with the soup\n      tureen against her bosom, she hummed above the steam, and thought of the\n      ribbons on her new chemises, bought out of the sovereign he had given her.",
                "And old Heythorp, digesting his osyters, snuffed the scent of the\n      hyacinths, and thought of the St. Germain, his favourite soup. It would\n      n't be first-rate, at this time of year -- should be made with little\n      young home-grown peas. Paris was the place for it. Ah! The French were the\n      fellows for eating, and -- looking things in the face! Not hypocrites -- not\n      ashamed of their reason or their senses!",
                "The soup came in. He sipped it, bending forward as far as he could, his\n      napkin tucked in over his shirt-front like a bib. He got the bouquet of\n      that sherry to a T -- his sense of smell was very keen to-night; rare\n      old stuff it was -- more than a year since he had tasted it -- but\n      no one drank sherry nowadays, hadn't the constitution for it! The fish\n      came up, and went down; and with the sweetbread he took his second glass\n      of champagne. Always the best, that second glass -- the stomach well\n      warmed, and the palate not yet dulled. Umm! So that fellow thought he had\n      him beaten, did he? And he said suddenly:",

                "With tempered gratitude the valet answered:",
                "\"Thank you, sir; much obliged, I'm sure.\" So the old buffer had found out\n      there was moth in it!",
                "\"Have I worried you much?\"",
                "\"No, sir; not at all, sir -- that is, no more than reason.\"",
                "\"Afraid I have. Very sorry -- can't help it. You'll find that, when you\n      get like me.\"",
                "\"Yes, sir; I've always admired your pluck, sir.",
                "\"Um! Very good of you to say so.\"",

                "\"Not at all, sir. Cook's done a little spinach in cream with the soubees.\"",

                "\"Thank you, sir.\"",
                "Alone again, old Heythorp sat unmoving, his brain just narcotically\n      touched. \"The flag flyin' -- the flag flyin'.\" He raised his glass and\n      sucked. He had an appetite now, and finished the three cutlets, and all\n      the sauce and spinach. Pity! he could have managed a snipe fresh shot! A\n      desire to delay, to lengthen dinner, was strong upon him; there were but\n      the souffle' and the savoury to come. He would have enjoyed, too, someone\n      to talk to. He had always been fond of good company -- been good\n      company himself, or so they said -- not that he had had a chance of\n      late. Even at the Boards they avoided talking to him, he had noticed for a\n      long time. Well! that wouldn't trouble him again -- he had sat through\n      his last Board, no doubt. They shouldn't kick him off, though; he wouldn't\n      give them that pleasure -- had seen the beggars hankering after his\n      chairman's shoes too long. The souffle was before him now, and lifting his\n      glass, he said:",

                "The servant filled, screwing up his mouth.",
                "Old Heythorp drank, and put the glass down empty with a sigh. He had been\n      faithful to his principles, finished the bottle before touching the sweet -- a\n      good bottle -- of a good brand! And now for the souffle! Delicious,\n      flipped down with the old sherry! So that holy woman was going to a ball,\n      was she! How deuced funny! Who would dance with a dry stick like that, all\n      eaten up with a piety which was just sexual disappointment? Ah! yes, lots\n      of women like that -- had often noticed 'em -- pitied 'em too, until\n      you had to do with them and they made you as unhappy as themselves, and\n      were tyrants into the bargain. And he asked:",

He felt happy, his\n      whole being lined and warmed and drowsed -- and there was more to come!\n      What had the holy folk to give you compared with the comfort of a good\n      dinner? Could they make you dream, and see life rosy for a little? No,\n      they could only give you promissory notes which never would be cashed. A\n      man had nothing but his pluck -- they only tried to undermine it, and\n      make him squeal for help. He could see his precious doctor throwing up his\n      hands: \"Port after a bottle of champagne -- you'll die of it!\" And a\n      very good death too -- none better. A sound broke the silence of the\n      closed-up room. Music? His daughter playing the piano overhead. Singing\n      too! What a trickle of a voice! Jenny Lind!

Then the music stopped; and no sound rose\n      but the tiny groans of the log trying to resist the fire. Dreamily he\n      thought: 'Life wears you out -- wears you out. Logs on a fire!' And he\n      filled his glass again. That fellow had been careless; there were dregs at\n      the bottom of the decanter and he had got down to them! Then, as the last\n      drop from his tilted glass trickled into the white hairs on his chin, he\n      heard the coffee tray put down, and taking his cigar he put it to his ear,\n      rolling it in his thick fingers. In prime condition! And drawing a first\n      whiff, he said:",

                "A minute of silence, then the man went hastily to the sideboard, took out\n      the bottle, and drew the cork. The tide of crimson in the old man's face\n      had frightened him.",
                "\"Leave it there.\"",
                "The unfortunate valet placed the bottle on the little table. 'I'll have to\n      tell her,' he thought; 'but if I take away the port decanter and the\n      glass, it won't look so bad.' And, carrying them, he left the room.",
                "Slowly the old man drank his coffee, and the liqueur of brandy. The whole\n      gamut! And watching his cigar-smoke wreathing blue in the orange glow, he\n      smiled. The last night to call his soul his own, the last night of his\n      independence. Send in his resignations to-morrow -- not wait to be\n      kicked off! Not give that fellow a chance!",
                "A voice which seemed to come from far off, said:",
                "\"Father! You're drinking brandy! How can you -- you know it's simple\n      poison to you!\" A figure in white, scarcely actual, loomed up close. He\n      took the bottle to fill up his liqueur glass, in defiance; but a hand in a\n      long white glove, with another dangling from its wrist, pulled it away,\n      shook it at him, and replaced it in the sideboard. And, just as when Mr.\n      Ventnor stood there accusing him, a swelling and churning in his throat\n      prevented him from speech; his lips moved, but only a little froth came\n      forth.",
                "His daughter had approached again. She stood quite close, in white satin,\n      thin-faced, sallow, with eyebrows raised, and her dark hair frizzed -- yes!\n      frizzed -- the holy woman! With all his might he tried to say: 'So you\n      bully me, do you -- you bully me to-night!' but only the word \"so\" and\n      a sort of whispering came forth. He heard her speaking. \"It's no good your\n      getting angry, Father. After champagne -- it's wicked!\" Then her form\n      receded in a sort of rustling white mist; she was gone; and he heard the\n      sputtering and growling of her taxi, bearing her to the ball. So! She\n      tyrannised and bullied, even before she had him at her mercy, did she? She\n      should see! Anger had brightened his eyes; the room came clear again. And\n      slowly raising himself he sounded the bell twice, for the girl, not for\n      that fellow Meller, who was in the plot. As soon as her pretty black and\n      white-aproned figure stood before him, he said:",
                "\"Help me up.\"",

                "\"Thank you; that'll do.\" Then, waiting till she was gone, he crossed the\n      room, fumbled open the sideboard door, and took out the bottle. Reaching\n      over the polished oak, he grasped a sherry glass; and holding the bottle\n      with both hands, tipped the liquor into it, put it to his lips and sucked.\n      Drop by drop it passed over his palate mild, very old, old as himself,\n      coloured like sunlight, fragrant. To the last drop he drank it, then\n      hugging the bottle to his shirt-front, he moved snail-like to his chair,\n      and fell back into its depths. For some minutes he remained there\n      motionless, the bottle clasped to his chest, thinking: 'This is not the\n      attitude of a gentleman. I must put it down on the table-on the table;'\n      but a thick cloud was between him and everything. It was with his hands he\n      would have to put the bottle on the table! But he could not find his\n      hands, could not feel them. His mind see-sawed in strophe and antistrophe:\n      \"You can't move!\" -- \"I will move!\" \"You're beaten\" -- \"I'm not\n      beat.\" \"Give up\" -- \"I won't.\" That struggle to find his hands seemed\n      to last for ever -- he must find them! After that -- go down -- all\n      standing -- after that! Everything round him was red. Then the red\n      cloud cleared just a little, and he could hear the clock -- \"tick-tick-tick\";\n      a faint sensation spread from his shoulders down to his wrists, down his\n      palms; and yes -- he could feel the bottle! He redoubled his struggle\n      to get forward in his chair; to get forward and put the bottle down. It\n      was not dignified like this! One arm he could move now; but he could not\n      grip the bottle nearly tight enough to put it down. Working his whole body\n      forward, inch by inch, he shifted himself up in the chair till he could\n      lean sideways, and the bottle, slipping down his chest, dropped slanting\n      to the edge of the low stool-table. Then with all his might he screwed his\n      trunk and arms an inch further, and the bottle stood. He had done it -- done\n      it! His lips twitched into a smile; his body sagged back to its old\n      position. He had done it! And he closed his eyes ....",
                "At half-past eleven the girl Molly, opening the door, looked at him and\n      said softly: \"Sirr! there's some ladies, and a gentleman!\" But he did not\n      answer. And, still holding the door, she whispered out into the hall:",
                "\"He's asleep, miss.\"",
                "A voice whispered back:",
                "\"Oh! Just let me go in, I won't wake him unless he does. But I do want to\n      show him my dress.\"",
                "The girl moved aside; and on tiptoe Phyllis passed in. She walked to\n      where, between the lamp-glow and the fire-glow, she was lighted up. White\n      satin -- her first low-cut dress -- the flush of her first supper\n      party -- a gardenia at her breast, another in her fingers! Oh! what a\n      pity he was asleep! How red he looked! How funnily old men breathed! And\n      mysteriously, as a child might, she whispered:",
                "\"Guardy!\"",
                "No answer! And pouting, she stood twiddling the gardenia. Then suddenly\n      she thought: 'I'll put it in his buttonhole! When he wakes up and sees it,\n      how he'll jump!'",
                "And stealing close, she bent and slipped it in. Two faces looked at her\n      from round the door; she heard Bob Pillin's smothered chuckle; her\n      mother's rich and feathery laugh. Oh! How red his forehead was! She\n      touched it with her lips; skipped back, twirled round, danced silently a\n      second, blew a kiss, and like quicksilver was gone.",
                "And the whispering, the chuckling, and one little out-pealing laugh rose\n      in the hall.",
                "But the old man slept. Nor until Meller came at his usual hour of\n      half-past twelve, was it known that he would never wake."

                "In their silver-wedding day Ashurst and his wife were motoring along the\n      outskirts of the moor, intending to crown the festival by stopping the\n      night at Torquay, where they had first met. This was the idea of Stella\n      Ashurst, whose character contained a streak of sentiment. If she had long\n      lost the blue-eyed, flower-like charm, the cool slim purity of face and\n      form, the apple-blossom colouring, which had so swiftly and so oddly\n      affected Ashurst twenty-six years ago, she was still at forty-three a\n      comely and faithful companion, whose cheeks were faintly mottled, and\n      whose grey-blue eyes had acquired a certain fullness.",
                "It was she who had stopped the car where the common rose steeply to the\n      left, and a narrow strip of larch and beech, with here and there a pine,\n      stretched out towards the valley between the road and the first long high\n      hill of the full moor. She was looking for a place where they might lunch,\n      for Ashurst never looked for anything; and this, between the golden furze\n      and the feathery green larches smelling of lemons in the last sun of April -- this,\n      with a view into the deep valley and up to the long moor heights, seemed\n      fitting to the decisive nature of one who sketched in water-colours, and\n      loved romantic spots. Grasping her paint box, she got out.",
                "\"Won't this do, Frank?\"",
                "Ashurst, rather like a bearded Schiller, grey in the wings, tall,\n      long-legged, with large remote grey eyes which sometimes filled with\n      meaning and became almost beautiful, with nose a little to one side, and\n      bearded lips just open -- Ashurst, forty-eight, and silent, grasped the\n      luncheon basket, and got out too.",
                "\"Oh! Look, Frank! A grave!\"",
                "By the side of the road, where the track from the top of the common\n      crossed it at right angles and ran through a gate past the narrow wood,\n      was a thin mound of turf, six feet by one, with a moorstone to the west,\n      and on it someone had thrown a blackthorn spray and a handful of\n      bluebells. Ashurst looked, and the poet in him moved. At cross-roads -- a\n      suicide's grave! Poor mortals with their superstitions! Whoever lay there,\n      though, had the best of it, no clammy sepulchre among other hideous graves\n      carved with futilities -- just a rough stone, the wide sky, and wayside\n      blessings! And, without comment, for he had learned not to be a\n      philosopher in the bosom of his family, he strode away up on to the\n      common, dropped the luncheon basket under a wall, spread a rug for his\n      wife to sit on -- she would turn up from her sketching when she was\n      hungry -- and took from his pocket Murray's translation of the\n      \"Hippolytus.\" He had soon finished reading of \"The Cyprian\" and her\n      revenge, and looked at the sky instead. And watching the white clouds so\n      bright against the intense blue, Ashurst, on his silver-wedding day,\n      longed for -- he knew not what. Maladjusted to life -- man's\n      organism! One's mode of life might be high and scrupulous, but there was\n      always an undercurrent of greediness, a hankering, and sense of waste. Did\n      women have it too? Who could tell? And yet, men who gave vent to their\n      appetites for novelty, their riotous longings for new adventures, new\n      risks, new pleasures, these suffered, no doubt, from the reverse side of\n      starvation, from surfeit. No getting out of it -- a maladjusted animal,\n      civilised man! There could be no garden of his choosing, of \"the\n      Apple-tree, the singing, and the gold,\" in the words of that lovely Greek\n      chorus, no achievable elysium in life, or lasting haven of happiness for\n      any man with a sense of beauty -- nothing which could compare with the\n      captured loveliness in a work of art, set down for ever, so that to look\n      on it or read was always to have the same precious sense of exaltation and\n      restful inebriety. Life no doubt had moments with that quality of beauty,\n      of unbidden flying rapture, but the trouble was, they lasted no longer\n      than the span of a cloud's flight over the sun; impossible to keep them\n      with you, as Art caught beauty and held it fast. They were fleeting as one\n      of the glimmering or golden visions one had of the soul in nature,\n      glimpses of its remote and brooding spirit. Here, with the sun hot on his\n      face, a cuckoo calling from a thorn tree, and in the air the honey savour\n      of gorse -- here among the little fronds of the young fern, the starry\n      blackthorn, while the bright clouds drifted by high above the hills and\n      dreamy valleys here and now was such a glimpse. But in a moment it would\n      pass -- as the face of Pan, which looks round the corner of a rock,\n      vanishes at your stare. And suddenly he sat up. Surely there was something\n      familiar about this view, this bit of common, that ribbon of road, the old\n      wall behind him. While they were driving he had not been taking notice -- never\n      did; thinking of far things or of nothing -- but now he saw! Twenty-six\n      years ago, just at this time of year, from the farmhouse within half a\n      mile of this very spot he had started for that day in Torquay whence it\n      might be said he had never returned. And a sudden ache beset his heart; he\n      had stumbled on just one of those past moments in his life, whose beauty\n      and rapture he had failed to arrest, whose wings had fluttered away into\n      the unknown; he had stumbled on a buried memory, a wild sweet time,\n      swiftly choked and ended. And, turning on his face, he rested his chin on\n      his hands, and stared at the short grass where the little blue milkwort\n      was growing....",
                "I",
                "And this is what he remembered.",
                "On the first of May, after their last year together at college, Frank\n      Ashurst and his friend Robert Garton were on a tramp. They had walked that\n      day from Brent, intending to make Chagford, but Ashurst's football knee\n      had given out, and according to their map they had still some seven miles\n      to go. They were sitting on a bank beside the-road, where a track crossed\n      alongside a wood, resting the knee and talking of the universe, as young\n      men will. Both were over six feet, and thin as rails; Ashurst pale,\n      idealistic, full of absence; Garton queer, round-the-corner, knotted,\n      curly, like some primeval beast. Both had a literary bent; neither wore a\n      hat.",
                "Ashurst's hair was smooth, pale, wavy, and had a way of rising on either\n      side of his brow, as if always being flung back; Carton's was a kind of\n      dark unfathomed mop. They had not met a soul for miles.",
                "\"My dear fellow,\" Garton was saying, \"pity's only an effect of\n      self-consciousness; it's a disease of the last five thousand years. The\n      world was happier without.\"",
                "Ashurst, following the clouds with his eyes, answered:",
                "\"It's the pearl in the oyster, anyway.\"",
                "\"My dear chap, all our modern unhappiness comes from pity. Look at\n      animals, and Red Indians, limited to feeling their own occasional\n      misfortunes; then look at ourselves -- never free from feeling the\n      toothaches of others. Let's get back to feeling for nobody, and have a\n      better time.\"",
                "\"You'll never practise that.\"",
                "Garton pensively stirred the hotch-potch of his hair.",
                "\"To attain full growth, one mustn't be squeamish. To starve oneself\n      emotionally's a mistake. All emotion is to the good -- enriches life.\"",
                "\"Yes, and when it runs up against chivalry?\"",
                "\"Ah! That's so English! If you speak of emotion the English always think\n      you want something physical, and are shocked. They're afraid of passion,\n      but not of lust -- oh, no! -- so long as they can keep it secret.\"",
                "Ashurst did not answer; he had plucked a blue floweret, and was twiddling\n      it against the sky. A cuckoo began calling from a thorn tree. The sky, the\n      flowers, the songs of birds! Robert was talking through his hat! And he\n      said:",
                "\"Well, let's go on, and find some farm where we can put up.\" In uttering\n      those words, he was conscious of a girl coming down from the common just\n      above them. She was outlined against the sky, carrying a basket, and you\n      could see that sky through the crook of her arm. And Ashurst, who saw\n      beauty without wondering how it could advantage him, thought: 'How\n      pretty!' The wind, blowing her dark frieze skirt against her legs, lifted\n      her battered peacock tam-o'-shanter; her greyish blouse was worn and old,\n      her shoes were split, her little hands rough and red, her neck browned.\n      Her dark hair waved untidy across her broad forehead, her face was short,\n      her upper lip short, showing a glint of teeth, her brows were straight and\n      dark, her lashes long and dark, her nose straight; but her grey eyes were\n      the wonder-dewy as if opened for the first time that day. She looked at\n      Ashurst -- perhaps he struck her as strange, limping along without a\n      hat, with his large eyes on her, and his hair falling back. He could not\n      take off what was not on his head, but put up his hand in a salute, and\n      said:",

                "\"There's only our farm near, sir.\" She spoke without shyness, in a pretty\n      soft crisp voice.",
                "\"And where is that?\"",
                "\"Down here, sir.\"",

                "\"Yes, Sir.\"",
                "He limped on, silent, and Garton took up the catechism.",

                "Descending past the narrow wood, they came on the farm suddenly-a long,\n      low, stone-built dwelling with casement windows, in a farmyard where pigs\n      and fowls and an old mare were straying. A short steep-up grass hill\n      behind was crowned with a few Scotch firs, and in front, an old orchard of\n      apple trees, just breaking into flower, stretched down to a stream and a\n      long wild meadow. A little boy with oblique dark eyes was shepherding a\n      pig, and by the house door stood a woman, who came towards them. The girl\n      said:",
                "\"It is Mrs. Narracombe, my aunt.\"",

                "Passing through a sort of porch made by two yew trees and some\n      flowering-currant bushes, the girl disappeared into the house, her peacock\n      tam-o'-shanter bright athwart that rosy-pink and the dark green of the\n      yews.",

                "The parlour, brick-floored, with bare table and shiny chairs and sofa\n      stuffed with horsehair, seemed never to have been used, it was so terribly\n      clean. Ashurst sat down at once on the sofa, holding his lame knee between\n      his hands, and Mrs. Narracombe gazed at him. He was the only son of a late\n      professor of chemistry, but people found a certain lordliness in one who\n      was often so sublimely unconscious of them.",
                "\"Is there a stream where we could bathe?\"",
                "\"There's the strame at the bottom of the orchard, but sittin' down you'll\n      not be covered!\"",

                "\"Down the lane, through the second gate on the right, an' the pool's by\n      the big apple tree that stands by itself. There's trout there, if you can\n      tickle them.\"",
                "\"They're more likely to tickle us!\"",
                "Mrs. Narracombe smiled. \"There'll be the tea ready when you come back.\"",
                "The pool, formed by the damming of a rock, had a sandy bottom; and the big\n      apple tree, lowest in the orchard, grew so close that its boughs almost\n      overhung the water; it was in leaf, and all but in flower-its crimson buds\n      just bursting. There was not room for more than one at a time in that\n      narrow bath, and Ashurst waited his turn, rubbing his knee and gazing at\n      the wild meadow, all rocks and thorn trees and feld flowers, with a grove\n      of beeches beyond, raised up on a flat mound. Every bough was swinging in\n      the wind, every spring bird calling, and a slanting sunlight dappled the\n      grass. He thought of Theocritus, and the river Cherwell, of the moon, and\n      the maiden with the dewy eyes; of so many things that he seemed to think\n      of nothing; and he felt absurdly happy.",
                "2",
                "During a late and sumptuous tea with eggs to it, cream and jam, and thin,\n      fresh cakes touched with saffron, Garton descanted on the Celts. It was\n      about the period of the Celtic awakening, and the discovery that there was\n      Celtic blood about this family had excited one who believed that he was a\n      Celt himself. Sprawling on a horse hair chair, with a hand-made cigarette\n      dribbling from the corner of his curly lips, he had been plunging his cold\n      pin-points of eyes into Ashurst's and praising the refinement of the\n      Welsh. To come out of Wales into England was like the change from china to\n      earthenware! Frank, as a d -- -d Englishman, had not of course\n      perceived the exquisite refinement and emotional capacity of that Welsh\n      girl! And, delicately stirring in the dark mat of his still wet hair, he\n      explained how exactly she illustrated the writings of the Welsh bard\n      Morgan-ap-Something in the twelfth century.",
                "Ashurst, full length on the horsehair sofa, and jutting far beyond its\n      end, smoked a deeply-coloured pipe, and did not listen, thinking of the\n      girl's face when she brought in a relay of cakes. It had been exactly like\n      looking at a flower, or some other pretty sight in Nature-till, with a\n      funny little shiver, she had lowered her glance and gone out, quiet as a\n      mouse.",
                "\"Let's go to the kitchen,\" said Garton, \"and see some more of her.\"",
                "The kitchen was a white-washed room with rafters, to which were attached\n      smoked hams; there were flower-pots on the window-sill, and guns hanging\n      on nails, queer mugs, china and pewter, and portraits of Queen Victoria. A\n      long, narrow table of plain wood was set with bowls and spoons, under a\n      string of high-hung onions; two sheep-dogs and three cats lay here and\n      there. On one side of the recessed fireplace sat two small boys, idle, and\n      good as gold; on the other sat a stout, light-eyed, red-faced youth with\n      hair and lashes the colour of the tow he was running through the barrel of\n      a gun; between them Mrs. Narracombe dreamily stirred some savoury-scented\n      stew in a large pot. Two other youths, oblique-eyed, dark-haired, rather\n      sly-faced, like the two little boys, were talking together and lolling\n      against the wall; and a short, elderly, clean-shaven man in corduroys,\n      seated in the window, was conning a battered journal. The girl Megan\n      seemed the only active creature-drawing cider and passing with the jugs\n      from cask to table. Seeing them thus about to eat, Garton said:",
                "\"Ah! If you'll let us, we'll come back when supper's over,\" and without\n      waiting for an answer they withdrew again to the parlour. But the colour\n      in the kitchen, the warmth, the scents, and all those faces, heightened\n      the bleakness of their shiny room, and they resumed their seats moodily.",
                "\"Regular gipsy type, those boys. There was only one Saxon -- the fellow\n      cleaning the gun. That girl is a very subtle study psychologically.\"",
                "Ashurst's lips twitched. Garton seemed to him an ass just then. Subtle\n      study! She was a wild flower. A creature it did you good to look at.\n      Study!",
                "Garton went on:",
                "\"Emotionally she would be wonderful. She wants awakening.\"",
                "\"Are you going to awaken her?\"",
                "Garton looked at him and smiled. 'How coarse and English you are!' that\n      curly smile seemed saying.",
                "And Ashurst puffed his pipe. Awaken her! That fool had the best opinion of\n      himself! He threw up the window and leaned out. Dusk had gathered thick.\n      The farm buildings and the wheel-house were all dim and bluish, the apple\n      trees but a blurred wilderness; the air smelled of woodsmoke from the\n      kitchen fire. One bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a\n      half-hearted twitter, as though surprised at the darkness. From the stable\n      came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse. And away over there was the\n      loom of the moor, and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet\n      full light, pricking white through the deep blue heavens. A quavering owl\n      hooted. Ashurst drew a deep breath. What a night to wander out in! A\n      padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane, and three dim, dark shapes\n      passed -- ponies on an evening march. Their heads, black and fuzzy,\n      showed above the gate. At the tap of his pipe, and a shower of little\n      sparks, they shied round and scampered. A bat went fluttering past,\n      uttering its almost inaudible \"chip, chip.\" Ashurst held out his hand; on\n      the upturned palm he could feel the dew. Suddenly from overhead he heard\n      little burring boys' voices, little thumps of boots thrown down, and\n      another voice, crisp and soft -- the girl's putting them to bed, no\n      doubt; and nine clear words \"No, Rick, you can't have the cat in bed\";\n      then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles, a soft slap, a laugh so low\n      and pretty that it made him shiver a little. A blowing sound, and the glim\n      of the candle which was fingering the dusk above, went out; silence\n      reigned. Ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down; his knee pained him,\n      and his soul felt gloomy.",
                "\"You go to the kitchen,\" he said; \"I'm going to bed.\"",
                "3",
                "For Ashurst the wheel of slumber was wont to turn noiseless and slick and\n      swift, but though he seemed sunk in sleep when his companion came up, he\n      was really wide awake; and long after Carton, smothered in the other bed\n      of that low-roofed room, was worshipping darkness with his upturned nose,\n      he heard the owls. Barring the discomfort of his knee, it was not\n      unpleasant -- the cares of life did not loom large in night watches for\n      this young man. In fact he had none; just enrolled a barrister, with\n      literary aspirations, the world before him, no father or mother, and four\n      hundred a year of his own. Did it matter where he went, what he did, or\n      when he did it? His bed, too, was hard, and this preserved him from fever.\n      He lay, sniffing the scent of the night which drifted into the low room\n      through the open casement close to his head. Except for a definite\n      irritation with his friend, natural when you have tramped with a man for\n      three days, Ashurst's memories and visions that sleepless night were\n      kindly and wistful and exciting. One vision, specially clear and\n      unreasonable, for he had not even been conscious of noting it, was the\n      face of the youth cleaning the gun; its intent, stolid, yet startled\n      uplook at the kitchen doorway, quickly shifted to the girl carrying the\n      cider jug. This red, blue-eyed, light-lashed, tow-haired face stuck as\n      firmly in his memory as the girl's own face, so dewy and simple. But at\n      last, in the square of darkness through the uncurtained casement, he saw\n      day coming, and heard one hoarse and sleepy caw. Then followed silence,\n      dead as ever, till the song of a blackbird, not properly awake, adventured\n      into the hush. And, from staring at the framed brightening light, Ashurst\n      fell asleep.",
                "Next day his knee was badly swollen; the walking tour was obviously over.\n      Garton, due back in London on the morrow, departed at midday with an\n      ironical smile which left a scar of irritation -- healed the moment his\n      loping figure vanished round the corner of the steep lane. All day Ashurst\n      rested his knee, in a green-painted wooden chair on the patch of grass by\n      the yew-tree porch, where the sunlight distilled the scent of stocks and\n      gillyflowers, and a ghost of scent from the flowering-currant bushes.\n      Beatifically he smoked, dreamed, watched.",
                "A farm in spring is all birth-young things coming out of bud and shell,\n      and human beings watching over the process with faint excitement feeding\n      and tending what has been born. So still the young man sat, that a\n      mother-goose, with stately cross-footed waddle, brought her six\n      yellow-necked grey-backed goslings to strop their little beaks against the\n      grass blades at his feet. Now and again Mrs. Narracombe or the girl Megan\n      would come and ask if he wanted anything, and he would smile and say:\n      \"Nothing, thanks. It's splendid here.\" Towards tea-time they came out\n      together, bearing a long poultice of some dark stuff in a bowl, and after\n      a long and solemn scrutiny of his swollen knee, bound it on. When they\n      were gone, he thought of the girl's soft \"Oh!\" -- of her pitying eyes,\n      and the little wrinkle in her brow. And again he felt that unreasoning\n      irritation against his departed friend, who had talked such rot about her.\n      When she brought out his tea, he said:",
                "\"How did you like my friend, Megan?\"",

                "\"No.\"",
                "\"Well, he meant that Joe was like the men who came over to England about\n      fourteen hundred years ago, and conquered it.\"",

                "\"Garton's crazy about that sort of thing; but I must say Joe does look a\n      bit Early Saxon.\"",
                "\"Yes.\"",
                "That \"Yes\" tickled Ashurst. It was so crisp and graceful, so conclusive,\n      and politely acquiescent in what was evidently. Greek to her.",

                "Ashurst wanted to take her hand and give it a squeeze, but he only\n      answered:",

                "When she was gone, Ashurst thought: 'Did she think I was chaffing her? I\n      wouldn't for the world!' He was at that age when to some men \"Beauty's a\n      flower,\" as the poet says, and inspires in them the thoughts of chivalry.\n      Never very conscious of his surroundings, it was some time before he was\n      aware that the youth whom Garton had called \"a Saxon type\" was standing\n      outside the stable door; and a fine bit of colour he made in his soiled\n      brown velvet-cords, muddy gaiters, and blue shirt; red-armed, red-faced,\n      the sun turning his hair from tow to flax; immovably stolid, persistent,\n      unsmiling he stood. Then, seeing Ashurst looking at him, he crossed the\n      yard at that gait of the young countryman always ashamed not to be slow\n      and heavy-dwelling on each leg, and disappeared round the end of the house\n      towards the kitchen entrance. A chill came over Ashurst's mood. Clods?\n      With all the good will in the world, how impossible to get on terms with\n      them! And yet -- see that girl! Her shoes were split, her hands rough;\n      but -- what was it? Was it really her Celtic blood, as Garton had said? -- she\n      was a lady born, a jewel, though probably she could do no more than just\n      read and write!",
                "The elderly, clean-shaven man he had seen last night in the kitchen had\n      come into the yard with a dog, driving the cows to their milking. Ashurst\n      saw that he was lame.",

Ashurst took them, small,\n      rough, brown; checked his impulse to put them to his lips, and let her\n      pull him up. She came close beside him, offering her shoulder. And leaning\n      on her he walked across the room. That shoulder seemed quite the\n      pleasantest thing he had ever touched. But, he had presence of mind enough\n      to catch his stick out of the rack, and withdraw his hand before arriving\n      at the kitchen.",
                "That night he slept like a top, and woke with his knee of almost normal\n      size. He again spent the morning in his chair on the grass patch,\n      scribbling down verses; but in the afternoon he wandered about with the\n      two little boys Nick and Rick. It was Saturday, so they were early home\n      from school; quick, shy, dark little rascals of seven and six, soon\n      talkative, for Ashurst had a way with children. By four o'clock they had\n      shown him all their methods of destroying life, except the tickling of\n      trout; and with breeches tucked up, lay on their stomachs over the trout\n      stream, pretending they had this accomplishment also. They tickled\n      nothing, of course, for their giggling and shouting scared every spotted\n      thing away. Ashurst, on a rock at the edge of the beech clump, watched\n      them, and listened to the cuckoos, till Nick, the elder and less\n      persevering, came up and stood beside him.",

                "She flushed crimson, frowned, and went out of the room. He sat, cursing\n      himself, till his tea was stewed. It was as if he had hacked with his\n      thick boots at a clump of bluebells. Why had he said such a silly thing?\n      Was he just a towny college ass like Robert Garton, as far from\n      understanding this girl?",
                "Ashurst spent the next week confirming the restoration of his leg, by\n      exploration of the country within easy reach. Spring was a revelation to\n      him this year. In a kind of intoxication he would watch the pink-white\n      buds of some backward beech tree sprayed up in the sunlight against the\n      deep blue sky, or the trunks and limbs of the few Scotch firs, tawny in\n      violent light, or again, on the moor, the gale-bent larches which had such\n      a look of life when the wind streamed in their young green, above the\n      rusty black underboughs. Or he would lie on the banks, gazing at the\n      clusters of dog-violets, or up in the dead bracken, fingering the pink,\n      transparent buds of the dewberry, while the cuckoos called and yafes\n      laughed, or a lark, from very high, dripped its beads of song. It was\n      certainly different from any spring he had ever known, for spring was\n      within him, not without. In the daytime he hardly saw the family; and when\n      Megan brought in his meals she always seemed too busy in the house or\n      among the young things in the yard to stay talking long. But in the\n      evenings he installed himself in the window seat in the kitchen, smoking\n      and chatting with the lame man Jim, or Mrs. Narracombe, while the girl\n      sewed, or moved about, clearing the supper things away. And sometimes,\n      with the sensation a cat must feel when it purrs, he would become\n      conscious that Megan's eyes -- those dew-grey eyes -- were fixed on\n      him with a sort of lingering soft look which was strangely flattering.",
                "It was on Sunday week in the evening, when he was lying in the orchard\n      listening to a blackbird and composing a love poem, that he heard the gate\n      swing to, and saw the girl come running among the trees, with the\n      red-cheeked, stolid Joe in swift pursuit. About twenty yards away the\n      chase ended, and the two stood fronting each other, not noticing the\n      stranger in the grass -- the boy pressing on, the girl fending him off.\n      Ashurst could see her face, angry, disturbed; and the youth's -- who\n      would have thought that red-faced yokel could look so distraught! And\n      painfully affected by that sight, he jumped up. They saw him then. Megan\n      dropped her hands, and shrank behind a tree trunk; the boy gave an angry\n      grunt, rushed at the bank, scrambled over and vanished. Ashurst went\n      slowly up to her. She was standing quite still, biting her lip-very\n      pretty, with her fine, dark hair blown loose about her face, and her eyes\n      cast down.",
                "\"I beg your pardon,\" he said.",
                "She gave him one upward look, from eyes much dilated; then, catching her\n      breath, turned away. Ashurst followed.",
                "\"Megan!\"",
                "But she went on; and taking hold of her arm, he turned her gently round to\n      him.",
                "\"Stop and speak to me.\"",
                "\"Why do you beg my pardon? It is not to me you should do that.\"",
                "\"Well, then, to Joe.\"",
                "\"How dare he come after me?\"",
                "\"In love with you, I suppose.\"",
                "She stamped her foot.",
                "Ashurst uttered a short laugh. \"Would you like me to punch his head?\"",
                "She cried with sudden passion:",
                "\"You laugh at me-you laugh at us!\"",
                "He caught hold of her hands, but she shrank back, till her passionate\n      little face and loose dark hair were caught among the pink clusters of the\n      apple blossom. Ashurst raised one of her imprisoned hands and put his lips\n      to it. He felt how chivalrous he was, and superior to that clod Joe -- just\n      brushing that small, rough hand with his mouth I Her shrinking ceased\n      suddenly; she seemed to tremble towards him. A sweet warmth overtook\n      Ashurst from top to toe. This slim maiden, so simple and fine and pretty,\n      was pleased, then, at the touch of his lips! And, yielding to a swift\n      impulse, he put his arms round her, pressed her to him, and kissed her\n      forehead. Then he was frightened -- she went so pale, closing her eyes,\n      so that the long, dark lashes lay on her pale cheeks; her hands, too, lay\n      inert at her sides. The touch of her breast sent a shiver through him.\n      \"Megan!\" he sighed out, and let her go. In the utter silence a blackbird\n      shouted. Then the girl seized his hand, put it to her cheek, her heart,\n      her lips, kissed it passionately, and fled away among the mossy trunks of\n      the apple trees, till they hid her from him.",
                "Ashurst sat down on a twisted old tree growing almost along the ground,\n      and, all throbbing and bewildered, gazed vacantly at the blossom which had\n      crowned her hair -- those pink buds with one white open apple star.\n      What had he done? How had he let himself be thus stampeded by beauty -- pity -- or -- just\n      the spring! He felt curiously happy, all the same; happy and triumphant,\n      with shivers running through his limbs, and a vague alarm. This was the\n      beginning of -- what? The midges bit him, the dancing gnats tried to\n      fly into his mouth, and all the spring around him seemed to grow more\n      lovely and alive; the songs of the cuckoos and the blackbirds, the\n      laughter of the yaflies, the level-slanting sunlight, the apple blossom\n      which had crowned her head! He got up from the old trunk and strode out of\n      the orchard, wanting space, an open sky, to get on terms with these new\n      sensations. He made for the moor, and from an ash tree in the hedge a\n      magpie flew out to herald him.",
                "Of man -- at any age from five years on -- who can say he has never\n      been in love? Ashurst had loved his partners at his dancing class; loved\n      his nursery governess; girls in school-holidays; perhaps never been quite\n      out of love, cherishing always some more or less remote admiration. But\n      this was different, not remote at all. Quite a new sensation; terribly\n      delightful, bringing a sense of completed manhood. To be holding in his\n      fingers such a wild flower, to be able to put it to his lips, and feel it\n      tremble with delight against them! What intoxication, and -- embarrassment!\n      What to do with it -- how meet her next time? His first caress had been\n      cool, pitiful; but the next could not be, now that, by her burning little\n      kiss on his hand, by her pressure of it to her heart, he knew that she\n      loved him. Some natures are coarsened by love bestowed on them; others,\n      like Ashurst's, are swayed and drawn, warmed and softened, almost exalted,\n      by what they feel to be a sort of miracle.",
                "And up there among the tors he was racked between the passionate desire to\n      revel in this new sensation of spring fulfilled within him, and a vague\n      but very real uneasiness. At one moment he gave himself up completely to\n      his pride at having captured this pretty, trustful, dewy-eyed thing! At\n      the next he thought with factitious solemnity: 'Yes, my boy! But look out\n      what you're doing! You know what comes of it!'",
                "Dusk dropped down without his noticing -- dusk on the carved,\n      Assyrian-looking masses of the rocks. And the voice of Nature said: \"This\n      is a new world for you!\" As when a man gets up at four o'clock and goes\n      out into a summer morning, and beasts, birds, trees stare at him and he\n      feels as if all had been made new.",
                "He stayed up there for hours, till it grew cold, then groped his way down\n      the stones and heather roots to the road, back into the lane, and came\n      again past the wild meadow to the orchard. There he struck a match and\n      looked at his watch. Nearly twelve! It was black and unstirring in there\n      now, very different from the lingering, bird-befriended brightness of six\n      hours ago! And suddenly he saw this idyll of his with the eyes of the\n      outer world -- had mental vision of Mrs. Narracombe's snake-like neck\n      turned, her quick dark glance taking it all in, her shrewd face hardening;\n      saw the gipsy-like cousins coarsely mocking and distrustful; Joe stolid\n      and furious; only the lame man, Jim, with the suffering eyes, seemed\n      tolerable to his mind. And the village pub! -- the gossiping matrons he\n      passed on his walks; and then -- his own friends -- Robert Carton's\n      smile when he went off that morning ten days ago; so ironical and knowing!\n      Disgusting! For a minute he literally hated this earthy, cynical world to\n      which one belonged, willy-nilly. The gate where he was leaning grew grey,\n      a sort of shimmer passed be fore him and spread into the bluish darkness.\n      The moon! He could just see it over the bank be hind; red, nearly round-a\n      strange moon! And turning away, he went up the lane which smelled of the\n      night and cowdung and young leaves. In the straw-yard he could see the\n      dark shapes of cattle, broken by the pale sickles of their horns, like so\n      many thin moons, fallen ends-up. He unlatched the farm gate stealthily.\n      All was dark in the house. Muffling his footsteps, he gained the porch,\n      and, blotted against one of the yew trees, looked up at Megan's window. It\n      was open. Was she sleeping, or lying awake perhaps, disturbed -- unhappy\n      at his absence? An owl hooted while he stood there peering up, and the\n      sound seemed to fill the whole night, so quiet was all else, save for the\n      never-ending murmur of the stream running below the orchard. The cuckoos\n      by day, and now the owls -- how wonderfully they voiced this troubled\n      ecstasy within him! And suddenly he saw her at her window, looking out. He\n      moved a little from the yew tree, and whispered: \"Megan!\" She drew back,\n      vanished, reappeared, leaning far down. He stole forward on the grass\n      patch, hit his shin against the green-painted chair, and held his breath\n      at the sound. The pale blur of her stretched-down arm and face did not\n      stir; he moved the chair, and noiselessly mounted it. By stretching up his\n      arm he could just reach. Her hand held the huge key of the front door, and\n      he clasped that burning hand with the cold key in it. He could just see\n      her face, the glint of teeth between her lips, her tumbled hair. She was\n      still dressed -- poor child, sitting up for him, no doubt! \"Pretty\n      Megan!\" Her hot, roughened fingers clung to his; her face had a strange,\n      lost look. To have been able to reach it -- even with his hand! The owl\n      hooted, a scent of sweetbriar crept into his nostrils. Then one of the\n      farm dogs barked; her grasp relaxed, she shrank back.",
                "\"Good-night, Megan!\"",
                "\"Good-night, sir!\" She was gone! With a sigh he dropped back to earth, and\n      sitting on that chair, took off his boots. Nothing for it but to creep in\n      and go to bed; yet for a long while he sat unmoving, his feet chilly in\n      the dew, drunk on the memory of her lost, half-smiling face, and the\n      clinging grip of her burning fingers, pressing the cold key into his hand.",
                "5",
                "He awoke feeling as if he had eaten heavily overnight, instead of having\n      eaten nothing. And far off, unreal, seemed yesterday's romance! Yet it was\n      a golden morning. Full spring had burst at last -- in one night the\n      \"goldie-cups,\" as the little boys called them, seemed to have made the\n      field their own, and from his window he could see apple blossoms covering\n      the orchard as with a rose and white quilt. He went down almost dreading\n      to see Megan; and yet, when not she but Mrs. Narracombe brought in his\n      breakfast, he felt vexed and disappointed. The woman's quick eye and snaky\n      neck seemed to have a new alacrity this morning. Had she noticed?",
                "\"So you an' the moon went walkin' last night, Mr. Ashurst! Did ye have\n      your supper anywheres?\"",
                "Ashurst shook his head.",

                "Was she mocking him, in that voice of hers, which still kept some Welsh\n      crispness against the invading burr of the West Country? If she knew! And\n      at that moment he thought: 'No, no; I'll clear out. I won't put myself in\n      such a beastly false position.'",
                "But, after breakfast, the longing to see Megan began and increased with\n      every minute, together with fear lest something should have been said to\n      her which had spoiled everything. Sinister that she had not appeared, not\n      given him even a glimpse of her! And the love poem, whose manufacture had\n      been so important and absorbing yesterday afternoon under the apple trees,\n      now seemed so paltry that he tore it up and rolled it into pipe spills.\n      What had he known of love, till she seized his hand and kissed it! And now -- what\n      did he not know? But to write of it seemed mere insipidity! He went up to\n      his bedroom to get a book, and his heart began to beat violently, for she\n      was in there making the bed. He stood in the doorway watching; and\n      suddenly, with turbulent joy, he saw her stoop and kiss his pillow, just\n      at the hollow made by his head last night.",
                "How let her know he had seen that pretty act of devotion? And yet, if she\n      heard him stealing away, it would be even worse. She took the pillow up,\n      holding it as if reluctant to shake out the impress of his cheek, dropped\n      it, and turned round.",
                "\"Megan!\"",
                "She put her hands up to her cheeks, but her eyes seemed to look right into\n      him. He had never before realised the depth and purity and touching\n      faithfulness in those dew-bright eyes, and he stammered:",
                "\"It was sweet of you to wait up for me last night.\"",
                "She still said nothing, and he stammered on:",
                "\"I was wandering about on the moor; it was such a jolly night. I -- I've\n      just come up for a book.\"",
                "Then, the kiss he had seen her give the pillow afflicted him with sudden\n      headiness, and he went up to her. Touching her eyes with his lips, he\n      thought with queer excitement: 'I've done it! Yesterday all was sudden -- anyhow;\n      but now -- I've done it!' The girl let her forehead rest against his\n      lips, which moved downwards till they reached hers. That first real\n      lover's kiss-strange, wonderful, still almost innocent -- in which\n      heart did it make the most disturbance?",
                "\"Come to the big apple tree to-night, after they've gone to bed.\n      Megan-promise!\"",
                "She whispered back: \"I promise.\"",
                "Then, scared at her white face, scared at everything, he let her go, and\n      went downstairs again. Yes! He had done it now! Accepted her love,\n      declared his own! He went out to the green chair as devoid of a book as\n      ever; and there he sat staring vacantly before him, triumphant and\n      remorseful, while under his nose and behind his back the work of the farm\n      went on. How long he had been sitting in that curious state of vacancy he\n      had no notion when he saw Joe standing a little behind him to the right.\n      The youth had evidently come from hard work in the fields, and stood\n      shifting his feet, breathing loudly, his face coloured like a setting sun,\n      and his arms, below the rolled-up sleeves of his blue shirt, showing the\n      hue and furry sheen of ripe peaches. His red lips were open, his blue eyes\n      with their flaxen lashes stared fixedly at Ashurst, who said ironically:",
                "\"Well, Joe, anything I can do for you?\"",

                "\"Very good of you, but, do you know, I prefer the others should speak for\n      themselves.\"",
                "The youth moved a pace or two nearer, and the scent of his honest heat\n      afflicted Ashurst's nostrils.",
                "\"What d'yu stay yere for?\"",
                "\"Because it pleases me.\"",
                "\"Twon't please yu when I've bashed yure head in!\"",
                "\"Indeed! When would you like to begin that?\"",
                "Joe answered only with the loudness of his breathing, but his eyes looked\n      like those of a young and angry bull. Then a sort of spasm seemed to\n      convulse his face.",
                "\"Megan don' want yu.\"",
                "A rush of jealousy, of contempt, and anger with this thick, loud-breathing\n      rustic got the better of Ashurst's self-possession; he jumped up, and\n      pushed back his chair.",
                "\"You can go to the devil!\"",
                "And as he said those simple words, he saw Megan in the doorway with a tiny\n      brown spaniel puppy in her arms. She came up to him quickly:",
                "\"Its eyes are blue!\" she said.",
                "Joe turned away; the back of his neck was literally crimson.",
                "Ashurst put his finger to the mouth of the little brown bullfrog of a\n      creature in her arms. How cosy it looked against her!",
                "\"It's fond of you already. Ah I Megan, everything is fond of you.\"",
                "\"What was Joe saying to you, please?\"",
                "\"Telling me to go away, because you didn't want me here.\"",
                "She stamped her foot; then looked up at Ashurst. At that adoring look he\n      felt his nerves quiver, just as if he had seen a moth scorching its wings.",
                "\"To-night!\" he said. \"Don't forget!\"",
                "\"No.\" And smothering her face against the puppy's little fat, brown body,\n      she slipped back into the house.",
                "Ashurst wandered down the lane. At the gate of the wild meadow he came on\n      the lame man and his cows.",

                "\"Have a fill, Jim?\"",
                "\"Thank 'ee, sir. She'm one in an 'underd, I think.\"",
                "\"I expect so,\" said Ashurst shortly, and folding up his pouch, walked on.",
                "\"Lovin'-hearted!\" Yes! And what was he doing? What were his intentions -- as\n      they say towards this loving-hearted girl? The thought dogged him,\n      wandering through fields bright with buttercups, where the little red\n      calves were feeding, and the swallows flying high. Yes, the oaks were\n      before the ashes, brown-gold already; every tree in different stage and\n      hue. The cuckoos and a thousand birds were singing; the little streams\n      were very bright. The ancients believed in a golden age, in the garden of\n      the Hesperides!... A queen wasp settled on his sleeve. Each queen wasp\n      killed meant two thousand fewer wasps to thieve the apples which would\n      grow from that blossom in the orchard; but who, with love in his heart,\n      could kill anything on a day like this? He entered a field where a young\n      red bull was feeding. It seemed to Ashurst that he looked like Joe. But\n      the young bull took no notice of this visitor, a little drunk himself,\n      perhaps, on the singing and the glamour of the golden pasture, under his\n      short legs. Ashurst crossed out unchallenged to the hillside above the\n      stream. From that slope a for mounted to its crown of rocks. The ground\n      there was covered with a mist of bluebells, and nearly a score of\n      crab-apple trees were in full bloom. He threw himself down on the grass.\n      The change from the buttercup glory and oak-goldened glamour of the fields\n      to this ethereal beauty under the grey for filled him with a sort of\n      wonder; nothing the same, save the sound of running water and the songs of\n      the cuckoos. He lay there a long time, watching the sunlight wheel till\n      the crab-trees threw shadows over the bluebells, his only companions a few\n      wild bees. He was not quite sane, thinking of that morning's kiss, and of\n      to-night under the apple tree. In such a spot as this, fauns and dryads\n      surely lived; nymphs, white as the crab-apple blossom, retired within\n      those trees; fauns, brown as the dead bracken, with pointed ears, lay in\n      wait for them. The cuckoos were still calling when he woke, there was the\n      sound of running water; but the sun had couched behind the tor, the\n      hillside was cool, and some rabbits had come out. 'Tonight!' he thought.\n      Just as from the earth everything was pushing up, unfolding under the soft\n      insistent fingers of an unseen hand, so were his heart and senses being\n      pushed, unfolded. He got up and broke off a spray from a crab-apple tree.\n      The buds were like Megan -- shell-like, rose-pink, wild, and fresh; and\n      so, too, the opening flowers, white, and wild; and touching. He put the\n      spray into his coat. And all the rush of the spring within him escaped in\n      a triumphant sigh. But the rabbits scurried away.",
                "6",
                "It was nearly eleven that night when Ashurst put down the pocket \"Odyssey\"\n       which for half an hour he had held in his hands without reading, and\n      slipped through the yard down to the orchard. The moon had just risen,\n      very golden, over the hill, and like a bright, powerful, watching spirit\n      peered through the bars of an ash tree's half-naked boughs. In among the\n      apple trees it was still dark, and he stood making sure of his direction,\n      feeling the rough grass with his feet. A black mass close behind him\n      stirred with a heavy grunting sound, and three large pigs settled down\n      again close to each other, under the wall. He listened. There was no wind,\n      but the stream's burbling whispering chuckle had gained twice its daytime\n      strength. One bird, he could not tell what, cried \"Pippip,\" \"Pip-pip,\"\n       with perfect monotony; he could hear a night-Jar spinning very far off; an\n      owl hooting. Ashurst moved a step or two, and again halted, aware of a dim\n      living whiteness all round his head. On the dark unstirring trees\n      innumerable flowers and buds all soft and blurred were being bewitched to\n      life by the creeping moonlight. He had the oddest feeling of actual\n      companionship, as if a million white moths or spirits had floated in and\n      settled between dark sky and darker ground, and were opening and shutting\n      their wings on a level with his eyes. In the bewildering, still, scentless\n      beauty of that moment he almost lost memory of why he had come to the\n      orchard. The flying glamour which had clothed the earth all day had not\n      gone now that night had fallen, but only changed into this new form. He\n      moved on through the thicket of stems and boughs covered with that live\n      powdering whiteness, till he reached the big apple tree. No mistaking\n      that, even in the dark, nearly twice the height and size of any other, and\n      leaning out towards the open meadows and the stream. Under the thick\n      branches he stood still again, to listen. The same sounds exactly, and a\n      faint grunting from the sleepy pigs. He put his hands on the dry, almost\n      warm tree trunk, whose rough mossy surface gave forth a peaty scent at his\n      touch. Would she come -- would she? And among these quivering, haunted,\n      moon-witched trees he was seized with doubts of everything! All was\n      unearthly here, fit for no earthly lovers; fit only for god and goddess,\n      faun and nymph not for him and this little country girl. Would it not be\n      almost a relief if she did not come? But all the time he was listening.\n      And still that unknown bird went \"Pip-pip,\" \"Pip-pip,\" and there rose the\n      busy chatter of the little trout stream, whereon the moon was flinging\n      glances through the bars of her tree-prison. The blossom on a level with\n      his eyes seemed to grow more living every moment, seemed with its\n      mysterious white beauty more and more a part of his suspense. He plucked a\n      fragment and held it close -- three blossoms. Sacrilege to pluck\n      fruit-tree blossom -- soft, sacred, young blossom -- and throw it\n      away! Then suddenly he heard the gate close, the pigs stirring again and\n      grunting; and leaning against the trunk, he pressed his hands to its mossy\n      sides behind him, and held his breath. She might have been a spirit\n      threading the trees, for all the noise she made! Then he saw her quite\n      close -- her dark form part of a little tree, her white face part of\n      its blossom; so still, and peering towards him. He whispered: \"Megan!\" and\n      held out his hands. She ran forward, straight to his breast. When he felt\n      her heart beating against him, Ashurst knew to the full the sensations of\n      chivalry and passion. Because she was not of his world, because she was so\n      simple and young and headlong, adoring and defenceless, how could he be\n      other than her protector, in the dark! Because she was all simple Nature\n      and beauty, as much a part of this spring night as was the living blossom,\n      how should he not take all that she would give him how not fulfil the\n      spring in her heart and his! And torn between these two emotions he\n      clasped her close, and kissed her hair. How long they stood there without\n      speaking he knew not. The stream went on chattering, the owls hooting, the\n      moon kept stealing up and growing whiter; the blossom all round them and\n      above brightened in suspense of living beauty. Their lips had sought each\n      other's, and they did not speak. The moment speech began all would be\n      unreal! Spring has no speech, nothing but rustling and whispering. Spring\n      has so much more than speech in its unfolding flowers and leaves, and the\n      coursing of its streams, and in its sweet restless seeking! And sometimes\n      spring will come alive, and, like a mysterious Presence stand, encircling\n      lovers with its arms, laying on them the fingers of enchantment, so that,\n      standing lips to lips, they forget everything but just a kiss. While her\n      heart beat against him, and her lips quivered on his, Ashurst felt nothing\n      but simple rapture -- Destiny meant her for his arms, Love could not be\n      flouted! But when their lips parted for breath, division began again at\n      once. Only, passion now was so much the stronger, and he sighed:",
                "\"Oh! Megan! Why did you come?\" She looked up, hurt, amazed.",
                "\"Sir, you asked me to.\"",
                "\"Don't call me 'sir,' my pretty sweet.\"",

                "\"All!\"",
                "So faint that he hardly heard, she whispered: \"I shall die if I can't be\n      with you.\"",
                "Ashurst took a mighty breath.",
                "\"Come and be with me, then!\"",
                "\"Oh!\"",
                "Intoxicated by the awe and rapture in that \"Oh!\" he went on, whispering:",
                "\"We'll go to London. I'll show you the world.",
                "\"And I will take care of you, I promise, Megan. I'll never be a brute to\n      you!\"",
                "\"If I can be with you -- that is all.\"",
                "He stroked her hair, and whispered on:",
                "\"To-morrow I'll go to Torquay and get some money, and get you some clothes\n      that won't be noticed, and then we'll steal away. And when we get to\n      London, soon perhaps, if you love me well enough, we'll be married.\"",
                "He could feel her hair shiver with the shake of her head.",
                "\"Oh, no! I could not. I only want to be with you!\"",
                "Drunk on his own chivalry, Ashurst went on murmuring, \"It's I who am not\n      good enough for you. Oh! Megan, when did you begin to love me?\"",
                "\"When I saw you in the road, and you looked at me. The first night I loved\n      you; but I never thought you would want me.\"",
                "She slipped down suddenly to her knees, trying to kiss his feet.",
                "A shiver of horror went through Ashurst; he lifted her up bodily and held\n      her fast -- too upset to speak.",
                "She whispered: \"Why won't you let me?\"",
                "\"It's I who will kiss your feet!\"",
                "Her smile brought tears into his eyes. The whiteness of her moonlit face\n      so close to his, the faint pink of her opened lips, had the living\n      unearthly beauty of the apple blossom.",
                "And then, suddenly, her eyes widened and stared past him painfully; she\n      writhed out of his arms, and whispered: \"Look!\"",
                "Ashurst saw nothing but the brightened stream, the furze faintly gilded,\n      the beech trees glistening, and behind them all the wide loom of the\n      moonlit hill. Behind him came her frozen whisper: \"The gipsy bogie!\"",
                "\"Where?\"",
                "\"There -- by the stone -- under the trees!\"",
                "Exasperated, he leaped the stream, and strode towards the beech clump.\n      Prank of the moonlight! Nothing! In and out of the boulders and thorn\n      trees, muttering and cursing, yet with a kind of terror, he rushed and\n      stumbled. Absurd! Silly! Then he went back to the apple tree. But she was\n      gone; he could hear a rustle, the grunting of the pigs, the sound of a\n      gate closing. Instead of her, only this old apple tree! He flung his arms\n      round the trunk. What a substitute for her soft body; the rough moss\n      against his face -- what a substitute for her soft cheek; only the\n      scent, as of the woods, a little the same! And above him, and around, the\n      blossoms, more living, more moonlit than ever, seemed to glow and breathe.",
                "7",
                "Descending from the train at Torquay station, Ashurst wandered uncertainly\n      along the front, for he did not know this particular queen of English\n      watering places. Having little sense of what he had on, he was quite\n      unconscious of being remarkable among its inhabitants, and strode along in\n      his rough Norfolk jacket, dusty boots, and battered hat, without observing\n      that people gazed at him rather blankly. He was seeking a branch of his\n      London bank, and having found one, found also the first obstacle to his\n      mood. Did he know anyone in Torquay? No. In that case, if he would wire to\n      his bank in London, they would be happy to oblige him on receipt of the\n      reply. That suspicious breath from the matter-of-fact world somewhat\n      tarnished the brightness of his visions. But he sent the telegram.",
                "Nearly opposite to the post office he saw a shop full of ladies' garments,\n      and examined the window with strange sensations. To have to undertake the\n      clothing of his rustic love was more than a little disturbing. He went in.\n      A young woman came forward; she had blue eyes and a faintly puzzled\n      forehead. Ashurst stared at her in silence.",
                "\"Yes, sir?\"",
                "\"I want a dress for a young lady.\"",
                "The young woman smiled. Ashurst frowned the peculiarity of his request\n      struck him with sudden force.",
                "The young woman added hastily:",
                "\"What style would you like -- something modish?\"",
                "\"No. Simple.\"",
                "\"What figure would the young lady be?\"",
                "\"I don't know; about two inches shorter than you, I should say.\"",
                "\"Could you give me her waist measurement?\"",
                "Megan's waist!",
                "\"Oh! anything usual!\"",
                "\"Quite!\"",
                "While she was gone he stood disconsolately eyeing the models in the\n      window, and suddenly it seemed to him incredible that Megan -- his\n      Megan could ever be dressed save in the rough tweed skirt, coarse blouse,\n      and tam-o'-shanter cap he was wont to see her in. The young woman had come\n      back with several dresses in her arms, and Ashurst eyed her laying them\n      against her own modish figure. There was one whose colour he liked, a\n      dove-grey, but to imagine Megan clothed in it was beyond him. The young\n      woman went away, and brought some more. But on Ashurst there had now come\n      a feeling of paralysis. How choose? She would want a hat too, and shoes,\n      and gloves; and, suppose, when he had got them all, they commonised her,\n      as Sunday clothes always commonised village folk! Why should she not\n      travel as she was? Ah! But conspicuousness would matter; this was a\n      serious elopement. And, staring at the young woman, he thought: 'I wonder\n      if she guesses, and thinks me a blackguard?'",
                "\"Do you mind putting aside that grey one for me?\" he said desperately at\n      last. \"I can't decide now; I'll come in again this afternoon.\"",
                "The young woman sighed.",
                "\"Oh! certainly. It's a very tasteful costume. I don't think you'll get\n      anything that will suit your purpose better.\"",
                "\"I expect not,\" Ashurst murmured, and went out.",
                "Freed again from the suspicious matter-of-factness of the world, he took a\n      long breath, and went back to visions. In fancy he saw the trustful,\n      pretty creature who was going to join her life to his; saw himself and her\n      stealing forth at night, walking over the moor under the moon, he with his\n      arm round her, and carrying her new garments, till, in some far-off wood,\n      when dawn was coming, she would slip off her old things and put on these,\n      and an early train at a distant station would bear them away on their\n      honeymoon journey, till London swallowed them up, and the dreams of love\n      came true.",
                "\"Frank Ashurst! Haven't seen you since Rugby, old chap!\"",
                "Ashurst's frown dissolved; the face, close to his own, was blue-eyed,\n      suffused with sun -- one of those faces where sun from within and\n      without join in a sort of lustre. And he answered:",
                "\"Phil Halliday, by Jove!\"",
                "\"What are you doing here?\"",
                "\"Oh! nothing. Just looking round, and getting some money. I'm staying on\n      the moor.\"",
                "\"Are you lunching anywhere? Come and lunch with us; I'm here with my young\n      sisters. They've had measles.\"",
                "Hooked in by that friendly arm Ashurst went along, up a hill, down a hill,\n      away out of the town, while the voice of Halliday, redolent of optimism as\n      his face was of sun, explained how \"in this mouldy place the only decent\n      things were the bathing and boating,\" and so on, till presently they came\n      to a crescent of houses a little above and back from the sea, and into the\n      centre one an hotel -- made their way.",
                "\"Come up to my room and have a wash. Lunch'll be ready in a jiffy.\"",
                "Ashurst contemplated his visage in a looking-glass. After his farmhouse\n      bedroom, the comb and one spare shirt regime of the last fortnight, this\n      room littered with clothes and brushes was a sort of Capua; and he\n      thought: 'Queer -- one doesn't realise But what -- he did not quite\n      know.",
                "When he followed Halliday into the sitting room for lunch, three faces,\n      very fair and blue-eyed, were turned suddenly at the words: \"This is Frank\n      Ashurst my young sisters.\"",
                "Two were indeed young, about eleven and ten. The third was perhaps\n      seventeen, tall and fair-haired too, with pink-and-white cheeks just\n      touched by the sun, and eyebrows, rather darker than the hair, running a\n      little upwards from her nose to their outer points. The voices of all\n      three were like Halliday's, high and cheerful; they stood up straight,\n      shook hands with a quick movement, looked at Ashurst critically, away\n      again at once, and began to talk of what they were going to do in the\n      afternoon. A regular Diana and attendant nymphs! After the farm this\n      crisp, slangy, eager talk, this cool, clean, off-hand refinement, was\n      queer at first, and then so natural that what he had come from became\n      suddenly remote. The names of the two little ones seemed to be Sabina and\n      Freda; of the eldest, Stella.",
                "Presently the one called Sabina turned to him and said:",
                "\"I say, will you come shrimping with us? -- it's awful fun!\"",
                "Surprised by this unexpected friendliness, Ashurst murmured:",
                "\"I'm afraid I've got to get back this afternoon.\"",
                "\"Oh!\"",
                "\"Can't you put it off?\"",
                "Ashurst turned to the new speaker, Stella, shook his head, and smiled. She\n      was very pretty! Sabina said regretfully: \"You might!\" Then the talk\n      switched off to caves and swimming.",
                "\"Can you swim far?\"",
                "\"About two miles.\"",
                "\"Oh!\"",
                "\"I say!\"",
                "\"How jolly!\"",
                "The three pairs of blue eyes, fixed on him, made him conscious of his new\n      importance -- The sensation was agreeable. Halliday said:",
                "\"I say, you simply must stop and have a bathe. You'd better stay the\n      night.\"",
                "\"Yes, do!\"'",
                "But again Ashurst smiled and shook his head. Then suddenly he found\n      himself being catechised about his physical achievements. He had rowed -- it\n      seemed -- in his college boat, played in his college football team, won\n      his college mile; and he rose from table a sort of hero. The two little\n      girls insisted that he must see \"their\" cave, and they set forth\n      chattering like magpies, Ashurst between them, Stella and her brother a\n      little behind. In the cave, damp and darkish like any other cave, the\n      great feature was a pool with possibility of creatures which might be\n      caught and put into bottles. Sabina and Freda, who wore no stockings on\n      their shapely brown legs, exhorted Ashurst to join them in the middle of\n      it, and help sieve the water. He too was soon bootless and sockless. Time\n      goes fast for one who has a sense of beauty, when there are pretty\n      children in a pool and a young Diana on the edge, to receive with wonder\n      anything you can catch! Ashurst never had much sense of time. It was a\n      shock when, pulling out his watch, he saw it was well past three. No\n      cashing his cheque to-day-the bank would be closed before he could get\n      there. Watching his expression, the little girls cried out at once:",
                "\"Hurrah! Now you'll have to stay!\"",
                "Ashurst did not answer. He was seeing again Megan's face, when at\n      breakfast time he had whispered: \"I'm going to Torquay, darling, to get\n      everything; I shall be back this evening. If it's fine we can go to-night.\n      Be ready.\" He was seeing again how she quivered and hung on his words.\n      What would she think? Then he pulled himself together, conscious suddenly\n      of the calm scrutiny of this other young girl, so tall and fair and\n      Diana-like, at the edge of the pool, of her wondering blue eyes under\n      those brows which slanted up a little. If they knew what was in his mind -- if\n      they knew that this very night he had meant! Well, there would be a little\n      sound of disgust, and he would be alone in the cave. And with a curious\n      mixture of anger, chagrin, and shame, he put his watch back into his\n      pocket and said abruptly:",
                "\"Yes; I'm dished for to-day.\"",
                "\"Hurrah! Now you can bathe with us.\"",
                "It was impossible not to succumb a little to the contentment of these\n      pretty children, to the smile on Stella's lips, to Halliday's \"Ripping,\n      old chap! I can lend you things for the night!\" But again a spasm of\n      longing and remorse throbbed through Ashurst, and he said moodily:",
                "\"I must send a wire!\"",
                "The attractions of the pool palling, they went back to the hotel. Ashurst\n      sent his wire, addressing it to Mrs. Narracombe: \"Sorry, detained for the\n      night, back to-morrow.\" Surely Megan would understand that he had too much\n      to do; and his heart grew lighter. It was a lovely afternoon, warm, the\n      sea calm and blue, and swimming his great passion; the favour of these\n      pretty children flattered him, the pleasure of looking at them, at Stella,\n      at Halliday's sunny face; the slight unreality, yet extreme naturalness of\n      it all -- as of a last peep at normality before he took this plunge\n      with Megan! He got his borrowed bathing dress, and they all set forth.\n      Halliday and he undressed behind one rock, the three girls behind another.\n      He was first into the sea, and at once swam out with the bravado of\n      justifying his self-given reputation. When he turned he could see Halliday\n      swimming along shore, and the girls flopping and dipping, and riding the\n      little waves, in the way he was accustomed to despise, but now thought\n      pretty and sensible, since it gave him the distinction of the only\n      deep-water fish. But drawing near, he wondered if they would like him, a\n      stranger, to come into their splashing group; he felt shy, approaching\n      that slim nymph. Then Sabina summoned him to teach her to float, and\n      between them the little girls kept him so busy that he had no time even to\n      notice whether Stella was accustomed to his presence, till suddenly he\n      heard a startled sound from her: She was standing submerged to the waist,\n      leaning a little forward, her slim white arms stretched out and pointing,\n      her wet face puckered by the sun and an expression of fear.",
                "\"Look at Phil! Is he all right? Oh, look!\"",
                "Ashurst saw at once that Phil was not all right. He was splashing and\n      struggling out of his depth, perhaps a hundred yards away; suddenly he\n      gave a cry, threw up his arms, and went down. Ashurst saw the girl launch\n      herself towards him, and crying out: \"Go back, Stella! Go back!\" he dashed\n      out. He had never swum so fast, and reached Halliday just as he was coming\n      up a second time. It was a case of cramp, but to get him in was not\n      difficult, for he did not struggle. The girl, who had stopped where\n      Ashurst told her to, helped as soon as he was in his depth, and once on\n      the beach they sat down one on each side of him to rub his limbs, while\n      the little ones stood by with scared faces. Halliday was soon smiling. It\n      was -- he said -- rotten of him, absolutely rotten! If Frank would\n      give him an arm, he could get to his clothes all right now. Ashurst gave\n      him the arm, and as he did so caught sight of Stella's face, wet and\n      flushed and tearful, all broken up out of its calm; and he thought: 'I\n      called her Stella! Wonder if she minded?'",
                "While they were dressing, Halliday said quietly, \"You saved my life, old\n      chap!\"",
                "\"Rot!\"",
                "Clothed, but not quite in their right minds, they went up all together to\n      the hotel and sat down to tea, except Halliday, who was lying down in his\n      room. After some slices of bread and jam, Sabina said:",
                "\"I say, you know, you are a brick!\" And Freda chimed in:",
                "\"Rather!\"",
                "Ashurst saw Stella looking down; he got up in confusion, and went to the\n      window. From there he heard Sabina mutter: \"I say, let's swear blood bond.\n      Where's your knife, Freda?\" and out of the corner of his eye could see\n      each of them solemnly prick herself, squeeze out a drop of blood and\n      dabble on a bit of paper. He turned and made for the door.",
                "\"Don't be a stoat! Come back!\" His arms were seized; imprisoned between\n      the little girls he was brought back to the table. On it lay a piece of\n      paper with an effigy drawn in blood, and the three names Stella Halliday,\n      Sabina Halliday, Freda Halliday -- also in blood, running towards it\n      like the rays of a star. Sabina said:",
                "\"That's you. We shall have to kiss you, you know.\"",
                "And Freda echoed:",
                "\"Oh! Blow -- Yes!\"",
                "Before Ashurst could escape, some wettish hair dangled against his face,\n      something like a bite descended on his nose, he felt his left arm pinched,\n      and other teeth softly searching his cheek. Then he was released, and\n      Freda said:",
                "\"Now, Stella.\"",
                "Ashurst, red and rigid, looked across the table at a red and rigid Stella.\n      Sabina giggled; Freda cried:",
                "\"Buck up -- it spoils everything!\"",
                "A queer, ashamed eagerness shot through Ashurst: then he said quietly:",
                "\"Shut up, you little demons!\"",
                "Again Sabina giggled.",
                "\"Well, then, she can kiss her hand, and you can put it against your nose.\n      It is on one side!\"",
                "To his amazement the girl did kiss her hand and stretch it out. Solemnly\n      he took that cool, slim hand and laid it to his cheek. The two little\n      girls broke into clapping, and Freda said:",
                "\"Now, then, we shall have to save your life at any time; that's settled.\n      Can I have another cup, Stella, not so beastly weak?\" Tea was resumed, and\n      Ashurst, folding up the paper, put it in his pocket. The talk turned on\n      the advantages of measles, tangerine oranges, honey in a spoon, no\n      lessons, and so forth. Ashurst listened, silent, exchanging friendly looks\n      with Stella, whose face was again of its normal sun-touched pink and\n      white. It was soothing to be so taken to the heart of this jolly family,\n      fascinating to watch their faces. And after tea, while the two little\n      girls pressed seaweed, he talked to Stella in the window seat and looked\n      at her water-colour sketches. The whole thing was like a pleasurable\n      dream; time and incident hung up, importance and reality suspended.\n      Tomorrow he would go back to Megan, with nothing of all this left save the\n      paper with the blood of these children, in his pocket. Children! Stella\n      was not quite that -- as old as Megan! Her talk -- quick, rather\n      hard and shy, yet friendly -- seemed to flourish on his silences, and\n      about her there was something cool and virginal -- a maiden in a bower.\n      At dinner, to which Halliday, who had swallowed too much sea-water, did\n      not come, Sabina said:",
                "\"I'm going to call you Frank.\"",
                "Freda echoed:",
                "\"Frank, Frank, Franky.\"",
                "Ashurst grinned and bowed.",
                "\"Every time Stella calls you Mr. Ashurst, she's got to pay a forfeit. It's\n      ridiculous.\"",
                "Ashurst looked at Stella, who grew slowly red. Sabina giggled; Freda\n      cried:",
                "\"She's 'smoking' -- 'smoking!' -- Yah!\"",
                "Ashurst reached out to right and left, and grasped some fair hair in each\n      hand.",
                "\"Look here,\" he said, \"you two! Leave Stella alone, or I'll tie you\n      together!\"",
                "Freda gurgled:",
                "\"Ouch! You are a beast!\"",
                "Sabina murmured cautiously:",
                "\"You call her Stella, you see!\"",
                "\"Why shouldn't I? It's a jolly name!\"",
                "\"All right; we give you leave to!\"",
                "Ashurst released the hair. Stella! What would she call him -- after\n      this? But she called him nothing; till at bedtime he said, deliberately:",
                "\"Good-night, Stella!\"",
                "\"Good-night, Mr. --  -- Good-night, Frank! It was jolly of you, you\n      know!\"",
                "\"Oh-that! Bosh!\"",
                "Her quick, straight handshake tightened suddenly, and as suddenly became\n      slack.",
                "Ashurst stood motionless in the empty sitting-room. Only last night, under\n      the apple tree and the living blossom, he had held Megan to him, kissing\n      her eyes and lips. And he gasped, swept by that rush of remembrance.\n      To-night it should have begun-his life with her who only wanted to be with\n      him! And now, twenty-four hours and more must pass, because-of not looking\n      at his watch! Why had he made friends with this family of innocents just\n      when he was saying good-bye to innocence, and all the rest of it? 'But I\n      mean to marry her,' he thought; 'I told her so!'",
                "He took a candle, lighted it, and went to his bedroom, which was next to\n      Halliday's. His friend's voice called, as he was passing:",
                "\"Is that you, old chap? I say, come in.\"",
                "He was sitting up in bed, smoking a pipe and reading.",
                "\"Sit down a bit.\"",
                "Ashurst sat down by the open window.",
                "\"I've been thinking about this afternoon, you know,\" said Halliday rather\n      suddenly. \"They say you go through all your past. I didn't. I suppose I\n      wasn't far enough gone.\"",
                "\"What did you think of?\"",
                "Halliday was silent for a little, then said quietly",
                "\"Well, I did think of one thing -- rather odd -- of a girl at\n      Cambridge that I might have -- you know; I was glad I hadn't got her on\n      my mind. Anyhow, old chap, I owe it to you that I'm here; I should have\n      been in the big dark by now. No more bed, or baccy; no more anything. I\n      say, what d'you suppose happens to us?\"",
                "Ashurst murmured:",

                "Halliday put his pipe down, crossed his hands behind his neck, and turned\n      his face towards the window.",
                "\"They're not bad kids!\" he said.",
                "Watching his friend, lying there, with that smile, and the candle-light on\n      his face, Ashurst shuddered. Quite true! He might have been lying there\n      with no smile, with all that sunny look gone out for ever! He might not\n      have been lying there at all, but \"sanded\" at the bottom of the sea,\n      waiting for resurrection on the ninth day, was it? And that smile of\n      Halliday's seemed to him suddenly something wonderful, as if in it were\n      all the difference between life and death -- the little flame -- the\n      all! He got up, and said softly:",
                "\"Well, you ought to sleep, I expect. Shall I blow out?\"",
                "Halliday caught his hand.",
                "\"I can't say it, you know; but it must be rotten to be dead. Good-night,\n      old boy!\"",
                "Stirred and moved, Ashurst squeezed the hand, and went downstairs. The\n      hall door was still open, and he passed out on to the lawn before the\n      Crescent. The stars were bright in a very dark blue sky, and by their\n      light some lilacs had that mysterious colour of flowers by night which no\n      one can describe. Ashurst pressed his face against a spray; and before his\n      closed eyes Megan started up, with the tiny brown spaniel pup against her\n      breast. \"I thought of a girl that I might have you know. I was glad I\n      hadn't got her on my mind!\" He jerked his head away from the lilac, and\n      began pacing up and down over the grass, a grey phantom coming to\n      substance for a moment in the light from the lamp at either end. He was\n      with her again under the living, breathing white ness of the blossom, the\n      stream chattering by, the moon glinting steel-blue on the bathing-pool;\n      back in the rapture of his kisses on her upturned face of innocence and\n      humble passion, back in the suspense and beauty of that pagan night. He\n      stood still once more in the shadow of the lilacs. Here the sea, not the\n      stream, was Night's voice; the sea with its sigh and rustle; no little\n      bird, no owl, no night-Jar called or spun; but a piano tinkled, and the\n      white houses cut the sky with solid curve, and the scent from the lilacs\n      filled the air. A window of the hotel, high up, was lighted; he saw a\n      shadow move across the blind. And most queer sensations stirred within\n      him, a sort of churning, and twining, and turning of a single emotion on\n      itself, as though spring and love, bewildered and confused, seeking the\n      way, were baffled. This girl, who had called him Frank, whose hand had\n      given his that sudden little clutch, this girl so cool and pure -- what\n      would she think of such wild, unlawful loving? He sank down on the grass,\n      sitting there cross-legged, with his back to the house, motionless as some\n      carved Buddha. Was he really going to break through innocence, and steal?\n      Sniff the scent out of a wild flower, and -- perhaps -- throw it\n      away? \"Of a girl at Cambridge that I might have -- you know!\" He put\n      his hands to the grass, one on each side, palms downwards, and pressed; it\n      was just warm still -- the grass, barely moist, soft and firm and\n      friendly. 'What am I going to do?' he thought. Perhaps Megan was at her\n      window, looking out at the blossom, thinking of him! Poor little Megan!\n      'Why not?' he thought. 'I love her! But do I really love her? or do I only\n      want her because she is so pretty, and loves me? What am I going to do?'\n      The piano tinkled on, the stars winked; and Ashurst gazed out before him\n      at the dark sea, as if spell-bound. He got up at last, cramped and rather\n      chilly. There was no longer light in any window. And he went in to bed.",
                "Out of a deep and dreamless sleep he was awakened by the sound of thumping\n      on the door. A shrill voice called:",
                "\"Hi! Breakfast's ready.\"",
                "He jumped up. Where was he -- ? Ah!",
                "He found them already eating marmalade, and sat down in the empty place\n      between Stella and Sabina, who, after watching him a little, said:",
                "\"I say, do buck up; we're going to start at half-past nine.\"",
                "\"We're going to Berry Head, old chap; you must come!\"",
                "Ashurst thought: 'Come! Impossible. I shall be getting things and going\n      back.' He looked at Stella. She said quickly:",
                "\"Do come!\"",
                "Sabina chimed in:",
                "\"It'll be no fun without you.\"",
                "Freda got up and stood behind his chair.",
                "\"You've got to come, or else I'll pull your hair!\"",
                "Ashurst thought: 'Well -- one day more -- to think it over! One day\n      more!' And he said:",
                "\"All right! You needn't tweak my mane!\"",
                "\"Hurrah!\"",
                "At the station he wrote a second telegram to the farm, and then tore it\n      up; he could not have explained why. From Brixham they drove in a very\n      little wagonette. There, squeezed between Sabina and Freda, with his knees\n      touching Stella's, they played \"Up, Jenkins \"; and the gloom he was\n      feeling gave way to frolic. In this one day more to think it over, he did\n      not want to think! They ran races, wrestled, paddled -- for to-day\n      nobody wanted to bathe -- they sang catches, played games, and ate all\n      they had brought. The little girls fell asleep against him on the way\n      back, and his knees still touched Stella's in the narrow wagonette. It\n      seemed incredible that thirty hours ago he had never set eyes on any of\n      those three flaxen heads. In the train he talked to Stella of poetry,\n      discovering her favourites, and telling her his own with a pleasing sense\n      of superiority; till suddenly she said, rather low:",
                "\"Phil says you don't believe in a future life, Frank. I think that's\n      dreadful.\"",
                "Disconcerted, Ashurst muttered:",
                "\"I don't either believe or not believe -- I simply don't know.\"",
                "She said quickly:",
                "\"I couldn't bear that. What would be the use of living?\"",
                "Watching the frown of those pretty oblique brows, Ashurst answered:",
                "\"I don't believe in believing things because a one wants to.\"",
                "\"But why should one wish to live again, if one isn't going to?\"",
                "And she looked full at him.",
                "He did not want to hurt her, but an itch to dominate pushed him on to say:",
                "\"While one's alive one naturally wants to go on living for ever; that's\n      part of being alive. But it probably isn't anything more.\"",
                "\"Don't you believe in the Bible at all, then?\"",
                "Ashurst thought: 'Now I shall really hurt her!'",
                "\"I believe in the Sermon on the Mount, because it's beautiful and good for\n      all time.\"",
                "\"But don't you believe Christ was divine?\"",
                "He shook his head.",
                "She turned her face quickly to the window, and there sprang into his mind\n      Megan's prayer, repeated by little Nick: \"God bless us all, and Mr.\n      Ashes!\" Who else would ever say a prayer for him, like her who at this\n      moment must be waiting -- waiting to see him come down the lane? And he\n      thought suddenly: 'What a scoundrel I am!'",
                "All that evening this thought kept coming back; but, as is not unusual,\n      each time with less poignancy, till it seemed almost a matter of course to\n      be a scoundrel. And -- strange! -- he did not know whether he was a\n      scoundrel if he meant to go back to Megan, or if he did not mean to go\n      back to her.",
                "They played cards till the children were sent off to bed; then Stella went\n      to the piano. From over on the window seat, where it was nearly dark,\n      Ashurst watched her between the candles -- that fair head on the long,\n      white neck bending to the movement of her hands. She played fluently,\n      without much expression; but what a Picture she made, the faint golden\n      radiance, a sort of angelic atmosphere hovering about her! Who could have\n      passionate thoughts or wild desires in the presence of that swaying,\n      white-clothed girl with the seraphic head? She played a thing of\n      Schumann's called \"Warum?\" Then Halliday brought out a flute, and the\n      spell was broken. After this they made Ashurst sing, Stella playing him\n      accompaniments from a book of Schumann songs, till, in the middle of \"Ich\n      grolle nicht,\" two small figures clad in blue dressing-gowns crept in and\n      tried to conceal themselves beneath the piano. The evening broke up in\n      confusion, and what Sabina called \"a splendid rag.\"",
                "That night Ashurst hardly slept at all. He was thinking, tossing and\n      turning. The intense domestic intimacy of these last two days, the\n      strength of this Halliday atmosphere, seemed to ring him round, and make\n      the farm and Megan -- even Megan -- seem unreal. Had he really made\n      love to her -- really promised to take her away to live with him? He\n      must have been bewitched by the spring, the night, the apple blossom! This\n      May madness could but destroy them both! The notion that he was going to\n      make her his mistress -- that simple child not yet eighteen -- now\n      filled him with a sort of horror, even while it still stung and whipped\n      his blood. He muttered to himself: \"It's awful, what I've done -- awful!\"\n       And the sound of Schumann's music throbbed and mingled with his fevered\n      thoughts, and he saw again Stella's cool, white, fair-haired figure and\n      bending neck, the queer, angelic radiance about her. 'I must have been -- I\n      must be-mad!' he thought. 'What came into me? Poor little Megan!' \"God\n      bless us all, and Mr. Ashes! I want to be with you -- only to be with\n      you!\" And burying his face in his pillow, he smothered down a fit of\n      sobbing. Not to go back was awful! To go back -- more awful still!",
                "Emotion, when you are young, and give real vent to it, loses its power of\n      torture. And he fell asleep, thinking: 'What was it -- a few kisses -- all\n      forgotten in a month!'",
                "Next morning he got his cheque cashed, but avoided the shop of the\n      dove-grey dress like the plague; and, instead, bought himself some\n      necessaries. He spent the whole day in a queer mood, cherishing a kind of\n      sullenness against himself. Instead of the hankering of the last two days,\n      he felt nothing but a blank -- all passionate longing gone, as if\n      quenched in that outburst of tears. After tea Stella put a book down\n      beside him, and said shyly:",
                "\"Have you read that, Frank?\"",
                "It was Farrar's \"Life of Christ.\" Ashurst smiled. Her anxiety about his\n      beliefs seemed to him comic, but touching. Infectious too, perhaps, for he\n      began to have an itch to justify himself, if not to convert her. And in\n      the evening, when the children and Halliday were mending their shrimping\n      nets, he said:",
                "\"At the back of orthodox religion, so far as I can see, there's always the\n      idea of reward -- what you can get for being good; a kind of begging\n      for favours. I think it all starts in fear.\"",
                "She was sitting on the sofa making reefer knots with a bit of string. She\n      looked up quickly:",
                "\"I think it's much deeper than that.\"",
                "Ashurst felt again that wish to dominate.",
                "\"You think so,\" he said; \"but wanting the 'quid pro quo' is about the\n      deepest thing in all of us! It's jolly hard to get to the bottom of it!\"",
                "She wrinkled her brows in a puzzled frown.",
                "\"I don't think I understand.\"",
                "He went on obstinately:",
                "\"Well, think, and see if the most religious people aren't those who feel\n      that this life doesn't give them all they want. I believe in being good\n      because to be good is good in itself.\"",
                "\"Then you do believe in being good?\"",
                "How pretty she looked now -- it was easy to be good with her! And he\n      nodded and said:",
                "\"I say, show me how to make that knot!\"",
                "With her fingers touching his, in manoeuvring the bit of string, he felt\n      soothed and happy. And when he went to bed he wilfully kept his thoughts\n      on her, wrapping himself in her fair, cool sisterly radiance, as in some\n      garment of protection.",
                "Next day he found they had arranged to go by train to Totnes, and picnic\n      at Berry Pomeroy Castle. Still in that resolute oblivion of the past, he\n      took his place with them in the landau beside Halliday, back to the\n      horses. And, then, along the sea front, nearly at the turning to the\n      railway station, his heart almost leaped into his mouth. Megan -- Megan\n      herself! -- was walking on the far pathway, in her old skirt and jacket\n      and her tam-o'-shanter, looking up into the faces of the passers-by.\n      Instinctively he threw his hand up for cover, then made a feint of\n      clearing dust out of his eyes; but between his fingers he could see her\n      still, moving, not with her free country step, but wavering, lost-looking,\n      pitiful-like some little dog which has missed its master and does not know\n      whether to run on, to run back -- where to run. How had she come like\n      this? -- what excuse had she found to get away? -- what did she hope\n      for? But with every turn of the wheels bearing him away from her, his\n      heart revolted and cried to him to stop them, to get out, and go to her!\n      When the landau turned the corner to the station he could stand it no\n      more, and opening the carriage door, muttered: \"I've forgotten something!\n      Go on -- don't wait for me! I'll join you at the castle by the next\n      train!\" He jumped, stumbled, spun round, recovered his balance, and walked\n      forward, while the carriage with the astonished Hallidays rolled on.",
                "From the corner he could only just see Megan, a long way ahead now. He ran\n      a few steps, checked himself, and dropped into a walk. With each step\n      nearer to her, further from the Hallidays, he walked more and more slowly.\n      How did it alter anything -- this sight of her? How make the going to\n      her, and that which must come of it, less ugly? For there was no hiding it -- since\n      he had met the Hallidays he had become gradually sure that he would not\n      marry Megan. It would only be a wild love-time, a troubled, remorseful,\n      difficult time -- and then -- well, then he would get tired, just\n      because she gave him everything, was so simple, and so trustful, so dewy.\n      And dew -- wears off! The little spot of faded colour, her\n      tam-o'-shanter cap, wavered on far in front of him; she was looking up\n      into every face, and at the house windows. Had any man ever such a cruel\n      moment to go through? Whatever he did, he felt he would be a beast. And he\n      uttered a groan which made a nursemaid turn and stare. He saw Megan stop\n      and lean against the sea-wall, looking at the sea; and he too stopped.\n      Quite likely she had never seen the sea before, and even in her distress\n      could not resist that sight. 'Yes-she's seen nothing,' he thought;\n      'everything's before her. And just for a few weeks' passion, I shall be\n      cutting her life to ribbons. I'd better go and hang myself rather than do\n      it!' And suddenly he seemed to see Stella's calm eyes looking into his,\n      the wave of fluffy hair on her forehead stirred by the wind. Ah! it would\n      be madness, would mean giving up all that he respected, and his own\n      self-respect. He turned and walked quickly back towards the station. But\n      memory of that poor, bewildered little figure, those anxious eyes\n      searching the passers-by, smote him too hard again, and once more he\n      turned towards the sea.",
                "The cap was no longer visible; that little spot of colour had vanished in\n      the stream of the noon promenaders. And impelled by the passion of\n      longing, the dearth which comes on one when life seems to be whirling\n      something out of reach, he hurried forward. She was nowhere to be seen;\n      for half an hour he looked for her; then on the beach flung himself face\n      downward in the sand. To find her again he knew he had only to go to the\n      station and wait till she returned from her fruitless quest, to take her\n      train home; or to take train himself and go back to the farm, so that she\n      found him there when she returned. But he lay inert in the sand, among the\n      indifferent groups of children with their spades and buckets. Pity at her\n      little figure wandering, seeking, was well-nigh merged in the\n      spring-running of his blood; for it was all wild feeling now -- the\n      chivalrous part, what there had been of it, was gone. He wanted her again,\n      wanted her kisses, her soft, little body, her abandonment, all her quick,\n      warm, pagan emotion; wanted the wonderful feeling of that night under the\n      moonlit apple boughs; wanted it all with a horrible intensity, as the faun\n      wants the nymph. The quick chatter of the little bright trout-stream, the\n      dazzle of the buttercups, the rocks of the old \"wild men\"; the calling of\n      the cuckoos and yaffles, the hooting of the owls; and the red moon peeping\n      out of the velvet dark at the living whiteness of the blossom; and her\n      face just out of reach at the window, lost in its love-look; and her heart\n      against his, her lips answering his, under the apple tree -- all this\n      besieged him. Yet he lay inert. What was it which struggled against pity\n      and this feverish longing, and kept him there paralysed in the warm sand?\n      Three flaxen heads -- a fair face with friendly blue -- grey eyes, a\n      slim hand pressing his, a quick voice speaking his name -- \"So you do\n      believe in being good?\" Yes, and a sort of atmosphere as of some old\n      walled-in English garden, with pinks, and cornflowers, and roses, and\n      scents of lavender and lilaccool and fair, untouched, almost holy -- all\n      that he had been brought up to feel was clean and good. And suddenly he\n      thought: 'She might come along the front again and see me!' and he got up\n      and made his way to the rock at the far end of the beach. There, with the\n      spray biting into his face, he could think more coolly. To go back to the\n      farm and love Megan out in the woods, among the rocks, with everything\n      around wild and fitting -- that, he knew, was impossible, utterly. To\n      transplant her to a great town, to keep, in some little flat or rooms, one\n      who belonged so wholly to Nature -- the poet in him shrank from it. His\n      passion would be a mere sensuous revel, soon gone; in London, her very\n      simplicity, her lack of all intellectual quality, would make her his\n      secret plaything -- nothing else. The longer he sat on the rock, with\n      his feet dangling over a greenish pool from which the sea was ebbing, the\n      more clearly he saw this; but it was as if her arms and all of her were\n      slipping slowly, slowly down from him, into the pool, to be carried away\n      out to sea; and her face looking up, her lost face with beseeching eyes,\n      and dark, wet hair-possessed, haunted, tortured him! He got up at last,\n      scaled the low rock-cliff, and made his way down into a sheltered cove.\n      Perhaps in the sea he could get back his control -- lose this fever!\n      And stripping off his clothes, he swam out. He wanted to tire himself so\n      that nothing mattered and swam recklessly, fast and far; then suddenly,\n      for no reason, felt afraid. Suppose he could not reach shore again -- suppose\n      the current set him out -- or he got cramp, like Halliday! He turned to\n      swim in. The red cliffs looked a long way off. If he were drowned they\n      would find his clothes. The Hallidays would know; but Megan perhaps never -- they\n      took no newspaper at the farm. And Phil Halliday's words came back to him\n      again: \"A girl at Cambridge I might have Glad I haven't got her on my\n      mind!\" And in that moment of unreasoning fear he vowed he would not have\n      her on his mind. Then his fear left him; he swam in easily enough, dried\n      himself in the sun, and put on his clothes. His heart felt sore, but no\n      longer ached; his body cool and refreshed.",
                "When one is as young as Ashurst, pity is not a violent emotion. And, back\n      in the Hallidays' sitting-room, eating a ravenous tea, he felt much like a\n      man recovered from fever. Everything seemed new and clear; the tea, the\n      buttered toast and jam tasted absurdly good; tobacco had never smelt so\n      nice. And walking up and down the empty room, he stopped here and there to\n      touch or look. He took up Stella's work-basket, fingered the cotton reels\n      and a gaily-coloured plait of sewing silks, smelt at the little bag filled\n      with woodroffe she kept among them. He sat down at the piano, playing\n      tunes with one finger, thinking: 'To-night she'll play; I shall watch her\n      while she's playing; it does me good to watch her.' He took up the book,\n      which still lay where she had placed it beside him, and tried to read. But\n      Megan's little, sad figure began to come back at once, and he got up and\n      leaned in the window, listening to the thrushes in the Crescent gardens,\n      gazing at the sea, dreamy and blue below the trees. A servant came in and\n      cleared the tea away, and he still stood, inhaling the evening air, trying\n      not to think. Then he saw the Hallidays coming through the gate of the\n      Crescent, Stella a little in front of Phil and the children, with their\n      baskets, and instinctively he drew back. His heart, too sore and\n      discomfited, shrank from this encounter, yet wanted its friendly solace -- bore\n      a grudge against this influence, yet craved its cool innocence, and the\n      pleasure of watching Stella's face. From against the wall behind the piano\n      he saw her come in and stand looking a little blank as though\n      disappointed; then she saw him and smiled, a swift, brilliant smile which\n      warmed yet irritated Ashurst.",
                "\"You never came after us, Frank.\"",
                "\"No; I found I couldn't.\"",
                "\"Look! We picked such lovely late violets!\" She held out a bunch. Ashurst\n      put his nose to them, and there stirred within him vague longings, chilled\n      instantly by a vision of Megan's anxious face lifted to the faces of the\n      passers-by.",
                "He said shortly: \"How jolly!\" and turned away. He went up to his room,\n      and, avoiding the children, who were coming up the stairs, threw himself\n      on his bed, and lay there with his arms crossed over his face. Now that he\n      felt the die really cast, and Megan given up, he hated himself, and almost\n      hated the Hallidays and their atmosphere of healthy, happy English homes.",
                "Why should they have chanced here, to drive away first love -- to show\n      him that he was going to be no better than a common seducer? What right\n      had Stella, with her fair, shy beauty, to make him know for certain that\n      he would never marry Megan; and, tarnishing it all, bring him such\n      bitterness of regretful longing and such pity? Megan would be back by now,\n      worn out by her miserable seeking -- poor little thing! -- expecting,\n      perhaps, to find him there when she reached home. Ashurst bit at his\n      sleeve, to stifle a groan of remorseful longing. He went to dinner glum\n      and silent, and his mood threw a dinge even over the children. It was a\n      melancholy, rather ill tempered evening, for they were all tired; several\n      times he caught Stella looking at him with a hurt, puzzled expression, and\n      this pleased his evil mood. He slept miserably; got up quite early, and\n      wandered out. He went down to the beach. Alone there with the serene, the\n      blue, the sunlit sea, his heart relaxed a little. Conceited fool -- to\n      think that Megan would take it so hard! In a week or two she would almost\n      have forgotten! And he well, he would have the reward of virtue! A good\n      young man! If Stella knew, she would give him her blessing for resisting\n      that devil she believed in; and he uttered a hard laugh. But slowly the\n      peace and beauty of sea and sky, the flight of the lonely seagulls, made\n      him feel ashamed. He bathed, and turned homewards.",
                "In the Crescent gardens Stella herself was sitting on a camp stool,\n      sketching. He stole up close behind. How fair and pretty she was, bent\n      diligently, holding up her brush, measuring, wrinkling her brows.",
                "He said gently:",
                "\"Sorry I was such a beast last night, Stella.\"",
                "She turned round, startled, flushed very pink, and said in her quick way:",
                "\"It's all right. I knew there was something. Between friends it doesn't\n      matter, does it?\"",
                "Ashurst answered:",
                "\"Between friends -- and we are, aren't we?\"",
                "She looked up at him, nodded vehemently, and her upper teeth gleamed again\n      in that swift, brilliant smile.",
                "Three days later he went back to London, travelling with the Hallidays. He\n      had not written to the farm. What was there he could say?",
                "On the last day of April in the following year he and Stella were\n      married....",
                "Such were Ashurst's memories, sitting against the wall among the gorse, on\n      his silver-wedding day. At this very spot, where he had laid out the\n      lunch, Megan must have stood outlined against the sky when he had first\n      caught sight of her. Of all queer coincidences! And there moved in him a\n      longing to go down and see again the farm and the orchard, and the meadow\n      of the gipsy bogle. It would not take long; Stella would be an hour yet,\n      perhaps.",
                "How well he remembered it all -- the little crowning group of pine\n      trees, the steep-up grass hill behind! He paused at the farm gate. The low\n      stone house, the yew-tree porch, the flowering currants -- not changed\n      a bit; even the old green chair was out there on the grass under the\n      window, where he had reached up to her that night to take the key. Then he\n      turned down the lane, and stood leaning on the orchard gate-grey skeleton\n      of a gate, as then. A black pig even was wandering in there among the\n      trees. Was it true that twenty-six years had passed, or had he dreamed and\n      awakened to find Megan waiting for him by the big apple tree?\n      Unconsciously he put up his hand to his grizzled beard and brought himself\n      back to reality. Opening the gate, he made his way down through the docks\n      and nettles till he came to the edge, and the old apple tree itself.\n      Unchanged! A little more of the greygreen lichen, a dead branch or two,\n      and for the rest it might have been only last night that he had embraced\n      that mossy trunk after Megan's flight and inhaled its woody savour, while\n      above his head the moonlit blossom had seemed to breathe and live. In that\n      early spring a few buds were showing already; the blackbirds shouting\n      their songs, a cuckoo calling, the sunlight bright and warm. Incredibly\n      the same-the chattering trout-stream, the narrow pool he had lain in every\n      morning, splashing the water over his flanks and chest; and out there in\n      the wild meadow the beech clump and the stone where the gipsy bogie was\n      supposed to sit. And an ache for lost youth, a hankering, a sense of\n      wasted love and sweetness, gripped Ashurst by the throat. Surely, on this\n      earth of such wild beauty, one was meant to hold rapture to one's heart,\n      as this earth and sky held it! And yet, one could not!",
                "He went to the edge of the stream, and looking down at the little pool,\n      thought: 'Youth and spring! What has become of them all, I wonder?'",
                "And then, in sudden fear of having this memory jarred by human encounter,\n      he went back to the lane, and pensively retraced his steps to the\n      crossroads.",
                "Beside the car an old, grey-bearded labourer was leaning on a stick,\n      talking to the chauffeur. He broke off at once, as though guilty of\n      disrespect, and touching his hat, prepared to limp on down the lane.",
                "Ashurst pointed to the narrow green mound. \"Can you tell me what this is?\"",
                "The old fellow stopped; on his face had come a look as though he were\n      thinking: 'You've come to the right shop, mister!'",
                "\"'Tes a grave,\" he said.",
                "\"But why out here?\"",
                "The old man smiled. \"That's a tale, as yu may say. An' not the first time\n      as I've a-told et -- there's plenty folks asks 'bout that bit o' turf.\n      'Maid's Grave' us calls et, 'ereabouts.\"",
                "Ashurst held out his pouch. \"Have a fill?\"",
                "The old man touched his hat again, and slowly filled an old clay pipe. His\n      eyes, looking upward out of a mass of wrinkles and hair, were still quite\n      bright.",
                "\"If yu don' mind, zurr, I'll zet down my leg's 'urtin' a bit today.\" And\n      he sat down on the mound of turf.",
                "\"There's always a flower on this grave. An' 'tain't so very lonesome,\n      neither; brave lot o' folks goes by now, in they new motor cars an' things -- not\n      as 'twas in th' old days. She've a got company up 'ere. 'Twas a poor soul\n      killed 'erself.\"",
                "\"I see!\" said Ashurst. \"Cross-roads burial. I didn't know that custom was\n      kept up.\"",

                "Ashurst, who was leaning against the gate, lighting his pipe, left his\n      curved hands before his face for long after the flame of the match had\n      gone out.",
                "\"Yes?\" he said, and to himself his voice sounded hoarse and queer.",
                "\"She was one in an 'underd, poor maid! I putts a flower 'ere every time I\n      passes. Pretty maid an' gude maid she was, though they wouldn't burry 'er\n      up to th' church, nor where she wanted to be burried neither.\" The old\n      labourer paused, and put his hairy, twisted hand flat down on the turf\n      beside the bluebells.",

                "\"'Twas in the spring, 'bout now as 't might be, or a little later -- blossom\n      time -- an' we 'ad one o' they young college gentlemen stayin' at the\n      farm-nice feller tu, with 'is 'ead in the air.

                "The old man stopped; his eyes, turned upward, had a bright, suffering\n      look.",

                "Mr. Bosengate spoke through the whirr of the engine:",
                "\"I don't expect to be late, dear. This business is ridiculous. There\n      oughtn't to be any crime in these days.\"",
                "His wife -- her name was Kathleen -- smiled. She looked very pretty\n      and cool, Mr. Bosengate thought. To him bound on this dull and stuffy\n      business everything he owned seemed pleasant -- the geranium beds\n      beside the gravel drive, his long, red-brick house mellowing decorously in\n      its creepers and ivy, the little clock-tower over stables now converted to\n      a garage, the dovecote, masking at the other end the conservatory which\n      adjoined the billiard-room. Close to the red-brick lodge his two children,\n      Kate and Harry, ran out from under the acacia trees, and waved to him,\n      scrambling bare-legged on to the low, red, ivy-covered wall which guarded\n      his domain of eleven acres. Mr. Bosengate waved back, thinking: 'Jolly\n      couple -- by Jove, they are!' Above their heads, through the trees, he\n      could see right away to some Downs, faint in the July heat haze. And he\n      thought: 'Pretty a spot as one could have got, so close to Town!'",
                "Despite the war he had enjoyed these last two years more than any of the\n      ten since he built \"Charmleigh\" and settled down to semi-rural domesticity\n      with his young wife. There had been a certain piquancy, a savour added to\n      existence, by the country's peril, and all the public service and\n      sacrifice it demanded. His chauffeur was gone, and one gardener did the\n      work of three. He enjoyed-positively enjoyed, his committee work; even the\n      serious decline of business and increase of taxation had not much worried\n      one continually conscious of the national crisis and his own part therein.\n      The country had wanted waking up, wanted a lesson in effort and economy;\n      and the feeling that he had not spared himself in these strenuous times,\n      had given a zest to those quiet pleasures of bed and board which, at his\n      age, even the most patriotic could retain with a good conscience. He had\n      denied himself many things -- new clothes, presents for Kathleen and\n      the children, travel, and that pine-apple house which he had been on the\n      point of building when the war broke out; new wine, too, and cigars, and\n      membership of the two Clubs which he had never used in the old days. The\n      hours had seemed fuller and longer, sleep better earned -- wonderful,\n      the things one could do without when put to it! He turned the car into the\n      high road, driving dreamily for he was in plenty of time. The war was\n      going pretty well now; he was no fool optimist, but now that conscription\n      was in force, one might reasonably hope for its end within a year. Then\n      there would be a boom, and one might let oneself go a little. Visions of\n      theatres and supper with his wife at the Savoy afterwards, and cosy night\n      drives back into the sweet-smelling country behind your own chauffeur once\n      more teased a fancy which even now did not soar beyond the confines of\n      domestic pleasures. He pictured his wife in new dresses by Jay -- she\n      was fifteen years younger than himself, and \"paid for dressing\" as they\n      said. He had always delighted -- as men older than their wives will -- in\n      the admiration she excited from others not privileged to enjoy her charms.\n      Her rather queer and ironical beauty, her cool irreproachable wifeliness,\n      was a constant balm to him. They would give dinner parties again, have\n      their friends down from town, and he would once more enjoy sitting at the\n      foot of the dinner table while Kathleen sat at the head, with the light\n      soft on her ivory shoulders, behind flowers she had arranged in that\n      original way of hers, and fruit which he had grown in his hot-houses; once\n      more he would take legitimate interest in the wine he offered to his\n      guests -- once more stock that Chinese cabinet wherein he kept cigars.\n      Yes -- there was a certain satisfaction in these days of privation, if\n      only from the anticipation they created.",
                "The sprinkling of villas had become continuous on either side of the high\n      road; and women going out to shop, tradesmen's boys delivering victuals,\n      young men in khaki, began to abound. Now and then a limping or bandaged\n      form would pass -- some bit of human wreckage; and Mr. Bosengate would\n      think mechanically: 'Another of those poor devils! Wonder if we've had his\n      case before us!'",
                "Running his car into the best hotel garage of the little town, he made his\n      way leisurely over to the court. It stood back from the market-place, and\n      was already lapped by a sea of persons having, as in the outer ring at\n      race meetings, an air of business at which one must not be caught out,\n      together with a soaked or flushed appearance. Mr. Bosengate could not\n      resist putting his handkerchief to his nose. He had carefully drenched it\n      with lavender water, and to this fact owed, perhaps, his immunity from the\n      post of foreman on the jury -- for, say what you will about the\n      English, they have a deep instinct for affairs.",
                "He found himself second in the front row of the jury box, and through the\n      odour of \"Sanitas\" gazed at the judge's face expressionless up there, for\n      all the world like a bewigged bust. His fellows in the box had that\n      appearance of falling between two classes characteristic of jurymen. Mr.\n      Bosengate was not impressed. On one side of him the foreman sat, a\n      prominent upholsterer, known in the town as \"Gentleman Fox.\" His dark and\n      beautifully brushed and oiled hair and moustache, his radiant linen, gold\n      watch and chain, the white piping to his waistcoat, and a habit of never\n      saying \"Sir\" had long marked him out from commoner men; he undertook to\n      bury people too, to save them trouble; and was altogether superior. On the\n      other side Mr. Bosengate had one of those men, who, except when they sit\n      on juries, are never seen without a little brown bag, and the appearance\n      of having been interrupted in a drink. Pale and shiny, with large loose\n      eyes shifting from side to side, he had an underdone voice and uneasy\n      flabby hands. Mr. Bosengate disliked sitting next to him. Beyond this\n      commercial traveller sat a dark pale young man with spectacles; beyond him\n      again, a short old man with grey moustache, mutton chops, and innumerable\n      wrinkles; and the front row was completed by a chemist. The three\n      immediately behind, Mr. Bosengate did not thoroughly master; but the three\n      at the end of the second row he learned in their order of an oldish man in\n      a grey suit, given to winking; an inanimate person with the mouth of a\n      moustachioed codfish, over whose long bald crown three wisps of damp hair\n      were carefully arranged; and a dried, dapperish, clean-shorn man, whose\n      mouth seemed terrified lest it should be surprised without a smile. Their\n      first and second verdicts were recorded without the necessity for\n      withdrawal, and Mr. Bosengate was already sleepy when the third case was\n      called. The sight of khaki revived his drooping attention. But what a\n      weedy-looking specimen! This prisoner had a truly nerveless pitiable\n      dejected air. If he had ever had a military bearing it had shrunk into him\n      during his confinement. His ill-shaped brown tunic, whose little brass\n      buttons seemed trying to keep smiling, struck Mr. Bosengate as\n      ridiculously short, used though he was to such things. 'Absurd,' he\n      thought -- 'Lumbago! Just where they ought to be covered!' Then the\n      officer and gentleman stirred in him, and he added to himself: 'Still,\n      there must be some distinction made!' The little soldier's visage had once\n      perhaps been tanned, but was now the colour of dark dough; his large brown\n      eyes with white showing below the iris, as so often in the eyes of very\n      nervous people -- wandered from face to face, of judge, counsel, jury,\n      and public. There were hollows in his cheeks, his dark hair looked damp;\n      around his neck he wore a bandage. The commercial traveller on Mr.\n      Bosengate's left turned, and whispered: \"Felo de se! My hat! what a guy!\"\n       Mr. Bosengate pretended not to hear -- he could not bear that fellow! -- and\n      slowly wrote on a bit of paper: \"Owen Lewis.\" Welsh! Well, he looked it -- not\n      at all an English face. Attempted suicide -- not at all an English\n      crime! Suicide implied surrender, a putting-up of hands to Fate -- to\n      say nothing of the religious aspect of the matter. And suicide in khaki\n      seemed to Mr. Bosengate particularly abhorrent; like turning tail in face\n      of the enemy; almost meriting the fate of a deserter. He looked at the\n      prisoner, trying not to give way to this prejudice. And the prisoner\n      seemed to look at him, though this, perhaps, was fancy.",
                "The Counsel for the prosecution, a little, alert, grey, decided man, above\n      military age, began detailing the circumstances of the crime. Mr.\n      Bosengate, though not particularly sensitive to atmosphere, could perceive\n      a sort of current running through the Court. It was as if jury and public\n      were thinking rhythmically in obedience to the same unexpressed prejudice\n      of which he himself was conscious. Even the Caesar-like pale face up\n      there, presiding, seemed in its ironic serenity responding to that\n      current.",
                "\"Gentlemen of the jury, before I call my evidence, I direct your attention\n      to the bandage the accused is still wearing. He gave himself this wound\n      with his Army razor, adding, if I may say so, insult to the injury he was\n      inflicting on his country. He pleads not guilty; and before the\n      magistrates he said that absence from his wife was preying on his mind\" -- the\n      advocate's close lips widened -- \"Well, gentlemen, if such an excuse is\n      to weigh with us in these days, I'm sure I don't know what's to happen to\n      the Empire.\"",
                "'No, by George!' thought Mr. Bosengate.",
                "The evidence of the first witness, a room-mate who had caught the\n      prisoner's hand, and of the sergeant, who had at once been summoned, was\n      conclusive and he began to cherish a hope that they would get through\n      without withdrawing, and he would be home before five. But then a hitch\n      occurred. The regimental doctor failed to respond when his name was\n      called; and the judge having for the first time that day showed himself\n      capable of human emotion, intimated that he would adjourn until the\n      morrow.",
                "Mr. Bosengate received the announcement with equanimity. He would be home\n      even earlier! And gathering up the sheets of paper he had scribbled on, he\n      put them in his pocket and got up. The would-be suicide was being taken\n      out of the court -- a shambling drab figure with shoulders hunched.\n      What good were men like that in these days! What good! The prisoner looked\n      up. Mr. Bosengate encountered in full the gaze of those large brown eyes,\n      with the white showing underneath. What a suffering, wretched, pitiful\n      face! A man had no business to give you a look like that! The prisoner\n      passed on down the stairs, and vanished. Mr. Bosengate went out and across\n      the market place to the garage of the hotel where he had left his car. The\n      sun shone fiercely and he thought: 'I must do some watering in the\n      garden.' He brought the car out, and was about to start the engine, when\n      someone passing said: \"Good evenin'. Seedy-lookin' beggar that last\n      prisoner, ain't he? We don't want men of that stamp.\" It was his neighbour\n      on the jury, the commercial traveller, in a straw hat, with a little brown\n      bag already in his hand and the froth of an interrupted drink on his\n      moustache. Answering curtly: \"Good evening!\" and thinking: 'Nor of yours,\n      my friend!' Mr. Bosengate started the car with unnecessary clamour. But as\n      if brought back to life by the commercial traveller's remark, the\n      prisoner's figure seemed to speed along too, turning up at Mr. Bosengate\n      his pitifully unhappy eyes. Want of his wife! -- queer excuse that for\n      trying to put it out of his power ever to see her again! Why! Half a loaf,\n      even a slice, was better than no bread. Not many of that neurotic type in\n      the Army -- thank Heaven! The lugubrious figure vanished, and Mr.\n      Bosengate pictured instead the form of his own wife bending over her\n      \"Gloire de Dijon roses\" in the rosery, where she generally worked a little\n      before tea now that they were short of gardeners. He saw her, as often he\n      had seen her, raise herself and stand, head to one side, a gloved hand on\n      her slender hip, gazing as it were ironically from under drooped lids at\n      buds which did not come out fast enough. And the word 'Caline,' for he was\n      something of a French scholar, shot through his mind: 'Kathleen -- Caline!'\n      If he found her there when he got in, he would steal up on the grass and -- ah!\n      but with great care not to crease her dress or disturb her hair! 'If only\n      she weren't quite so self-contained,' he thought; 'It's like a cat you\n      can't get near, not really near!'",
                "The car, returning faster than it had come down that morning, had already\n      passed the outskirt villas, and was breasting the hill to where, among\n      fields and the old trees, Charmleigh lay apart from commoner life. Turning\n      into his drive, Mr. Bosengate thought with a certain surprise: 'I wonder\n      what she does think of! I wonder!' He put his gloves and hat down in the\n      outer hall and went into the lavatory, to dip his face in cool water and\n      wash it with sweet-smelling soap -- delicious revenge on the unclean\n      atmosphere in which he had been stewing so many hours. He came out again\n      into the hall dazed by soap and the mellowed light, and a voice from\n      half-way up the stairs said: \"Daddy! Look!\" His little daughter was\n      standing up there with one hand on the banisters. She scrambled on to them\n      and came sliding down, her frock up to her eyes, and her holland knickers\n      to her middle. Mr. Bosengate said mildly:",
                "\"Well, that's elegant!\"",
                "\"Tea's in the summer-house. Mummy's waiting. Come on!\"",
                "With her hand in his, Mr. Bosengate went on, through the drawing-room,\n      long and cool, with sun-blinds down, through the billiard-room, high and\n      cool, through the conservatory, green and sweet-smelling, out on to the\n      terrace and the upper lawn. He had never felt such sheer exhilarated joy\n      in his home surroundings, so cool, glistening and green under the July\n      sun; and he said:",
                "\"Well, Kit, what have you all been doing?\"",
                "\"I've fed my rabbits and Harry's; and we've been in the attic; Harry got\n      his leg through the skylight.\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate drew in his breath with a hiss.",
                "\"It's all right, Daddy; we got it out again, it's only grazed the skin.\n      And we've been making swabs -- I made seventeen, Mummy made\n      thirty-three, and then she went to the hospital. Did you put many men in\n      prison?\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate cleared his throat. The question seemed to him untimely.",
                "\"Only two.\"",
                "\"What's it like in prison, Daddy?\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate, who had no more knowledge than his little daughter, replied\n      in an absent voice:",
                "\"Not very nice.\"",
                "They were passing under a young oak tree, where the path wound round to\n      the rosery and summer-house. Something shot down and clawed Mr.\n      Bosengate's neck. His little daughter began to hop and suffocate with\n      laughter.",
                "\"Oh, Daddy! Aren't you caught! I led you on purpose!\"",
                "Looking up, Mr. Bosengate saw his small son lying along a low branch above\n      him -- like the leopard he was declaring himself to be (for fear of\n      error), and thought blithely: 'What an active little chap it is!' \"Let me\n      drop on your shoulders, Daddy -- like they do on the deer.\"",
                "\"Oh, yes! Do be a deer, Daddy!\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate did not see being a deer; his hair had just been brushed.\n      But he entered the rosery buoyantly between his offspring. His wife was\n      standing precisely as he had imagined her, in a pale blue frock open at\n      the neck, with a narrow black band round the waist, and little accordion\n      pleats below. She looked her coolest. Her smile, when she turned her head,\n      hardly seemed to take Mr. Bosengate seriously enough. He placed his lips\n      below one of her half-drooped eyelids. She even smelled of roses. His\n      children began to dance round their mother, and Mr. Bosengate, -- firmly\n      held between them, was also compelled to do this, until she said:",
                "\"When you've quite done, let's have tea!\"",
                "It was not the greeting he had imagined coming along in the car. Earwigs\n      were plentiful in the summer-house -- used perhaps twice a year, but\n      indispensable to every country residence -- and Mr. Bosengate was not\n      sorry for the excuse to get out again. Though all was so pleasant, he felt\n      oddly restless, rather suffocated; and lighting his pipe, began to move\n      about among the roses, blowing tobacco at the greenfly; in war-time one\n      was never quite idle! And suddenly he said:",
                "\"We're trying a wretched Tommy at the assizes.\"",
                "His wife looked up from a rose.",
                "\"What for?\"",
                "\"Attempted suicide.\"",
                "\"Why did he?\"",
                "\"Can't stand the separation from his wife.\"",
                "She looked at him, gave a low laugh, and said:",
                "\"Oh dear!\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate was puzzled. Why did she laugh? He looked round, saw that\n      the children were gone, took his pipe from his mouth, and approached her.",
                "\"You look very pretty,\" he said. \"Give me a kiss!\"",
                "His wife bent her body forward from the waist, and pushed her lips out\n      till they touched his moustache. Mr. Bosengate felt a sensation as if he\n      had arisen from breakfast, without having eaten marmalade. He mastered it,\n      and said:",
                "\"That jury are a rum lot.\"",
                "His wife's eyelids flickered. \"I wish women sat on juries.\"",
                "\"Why?\"",
                "\"It would be an experience.\"",
                "Not the first time she had used that curious expression! Yet her life was\n      far from dull, so far as he could see; with the new interests created by\n      the war, and the constant calls on her time made by the perfection of\n      their home life, she had a useful and busy existence. Again the random\n      thought passed through him: 'But she never tells me anything!' And\n      suddenly that lugubrious khaki-clad figure started up among the rose\n      bushes. \"We've got a lot to be thankful for!\" he said abruptly. \"I must go\n      to work!\" His wife, raising one eyebrow, smiled. \"And I to weep!\" Mr.\n      Bosengate laughed -- she had a pretty wit! And stroking his comely\n      moustache where it had been kissed, he moved out into the sunshine. All\n      the evening, throughout his labours, not inconsiderable, for this jury\n      business had put him behind time, he was afflicted by that restless\n      pleasure in his surroundings; would break off in mowing the lower lawn to\n      look at the house through the trees; would leave his study and committee\n      papers, to cross into the drawing-room and sniff its dainty fragrance;\n      paid a special good-night visit to the children having supper in the\n      schoolroom; pottered in and out from his dressing room to admire his wife\n      while she was changing for dinner; dined with his mind perpetually on the\n      next course; talked volubly of the war; and in the billiard room\n      afterwards, smoking the pipe which had taken the place of his cigar, could\n      not keep still, but roamed about, now in conservatory, now in the\n      drawing-room, where his wife and the governess were still making swabs. It\n      seemed to him that he could not have enough of anything. About eleven\n      o'clock he strolled out beautiful night, only just dark enough -- under\n      the new arrangement with Time -- and went down to the little round\n      fountain below the terrace. His wife was playing the piano. Mr. Bosengate\n      looked at the water and the flat dark water lily leaves which floated\n      there; looked up at the house, where only narrow chinks of light showed,\n      because of the Lighting Order. The dreamy music drifted out; there was a\n      scent of heliotrope. He moved a few steps back, and sat in the children's\n      swing under an old lime tree. Jolly -- blissful -- in the warm,\n      bloomy dark! Of all hours of the day, this before going to bed was perhaps\n      the pleasantest. He saw the light go up in his wife's bed room, unscreened\n      for a full minute, and thought: 'Aha! If I did my duty as a special, I\n      should \"strafe\" her for that.' She came to the window, her figure lighted,\n      hands up to the back of her head, so that her bare arms gleamed. Mr.\n      Bosengate wafted her a kiss, knowing he could not be seen. 'Lucky chap!'\n      he mused; 'she's a great joy!' Up went her arm, down came the blind the\n      house was dark again. He drew a long breath. 'Another ten minutes,' he\n      thought, 'then I'll go in and shut up. By Jove! The limes are beginning to\n      smell already!' And, the better to take in that acme of his well-being, he\n      tilted the swing, lifted his feet from the ground, and swung himself\n      toward the scented blossoms. He wanted to whelm his senses in their\n      perfume, and closed his eyes. But instead of the domestic vision he\n      expected, the face of the little Welsh soldier, hare-eyed, shadowy,\n      pinched and dark and pitiful, started up with such disturbing vividness\n      that he opened his eyes again at once. Curse! The fellow almost haunted\n      one! Where would he be now poor little devil! -- lying in his cell,\n      thinking -- thinking of his wife! Feeling suddenly morbid, Mr.\n      Bosengate arrested the swing and stood up. Absurd! -- all his\n      well-being and mood of warm anticipation had deserted him! 'A d -- -d\n      world!' he thought. 'Such a lot of misery! Why should I have to sit in\n      judgment on that poor beggar, and condemn him?' He moved up on to the\n      terrace and walked briskly, to rid himself of this disturbance before\n      going in. 'That commercial traveller chap,' he thought, 'the rest of those\n      fellows -- they see nothing!' And, abruptly turning up the three stone\n      steps, he entered the conservatory, locked it, passed into the billiard\n      room, and drank his barley water. One of the pictures was hanging crooked;\n      he went up to put it straight. Still life. Grapes and apples, and -- lobsters!\n      They struck him as odd for the first time. Why lobsters? The whole picture\n      seemed dead and oily. He turned off the light, and went upstairs, passed\n      his wife's door, into his own room, and undressed. Clothed in his pyjamas\n      he opened the door between the rooms. By the light coming from his own he\n      could see her dark head on the pillow. Was she asleep? No -- not\n      asleep, certainly. The moment of fruition had come; the crowning of his\n      pride and pleasure in his home. But he continued to stand there. He had\n      suddenly no pride, no pleasure, no desire; nothing but a sort of dull\n      resentment against everything. He turned back; shut the door, and slipping\n      between the heavy curtains and his open window, stood looking out at the\n      night. 'Full of misery!' he thought. 'Full of d -- -d misery!'",
                "II",
                "Filing into the jury box next morning, Mr. Bosengate collided slightly\n      with a short juryman, whose square figure and square head of stiff\n      yellow-red hair he had only vaguely noticed the day before. The man looked\n      angry, and Mr. Bosengate thought: 'An ill-bred dog, that!'",
                "He sat down quickly, and, to avoid further recognition of his fellows,\n      gazed in front of him. His appearance on Saturdays was always military, by\n      reason of the route march of his Volunteer Corps in the afternoon.\n      Gentleman Fox, who belonged to the corps too, was also looking square; but\n      that commercial traveller on his other side seemed more louche, and as if\n      surprised in immorality, than ever; only the proximity of Gentleman Fox on\n      the other side kept Mr. Bosengate from shrinking. Then he saw the prisoner\n      being brought in, shadowy and dark behind the brightness of his buttons,\n      and he experienced a sort of shock, this figure was so exactly that which\n      had several times started up in his mind. Somehow he had expected a fresh\n      sight of the fellow to dispel and disprove what had been haunting him, had\n      expected to find him just an outside phenomenon, not, as it were, a part\n      of his own life. And he gazed at the carven immobility of the judge's\n      face, trying to steady himself, as a drunken man will, by looking at a\n      light. The regimental doctor, unabashed by the judge's comment on his\n      absence the day before, gave his evidence like a man who had better things\n      to do, and the case for the prosecution was forthwith rounded in by a\n      little speech from counsel. The matter -- he said -- was clear as\n      daylight. Those who wore His Majesty's uniform, charged with the\n      responsibility and privilege of defending their country, were no more\n      entitled to desert their regiments by taking their own lives than they\n      were entitled to desert in any other way. He asked for a conviction. Mr.\n      Bosengate felt a sympathetic shuffle passing through all feet; the judge\n      was speaking:",
                "\"Prisoner, you can either go into the witness box and make your statement\n      on oath, in which case you may be cross-examined on it; or you can make\n      your statement there from the dock, in which case you will not be\n      cross-examined. Which do you elect to do?\"",
                "\"From here, my lord.\"",
                "Seeing him now full face, and, as it might be, come to life in the effort\n      to convey his feelings, Mr. Bosengate had suddenly a quite different\n      impression of the fellow. It was as if his khaki had fallen off, and he\n      had stepped out of his own shadow, a live and quivering creature. His\n      pinched clean-shaven face seemed to have an irregular, wilder, hairier\n      look, his large nervous brown eyes darkened and glowed; he jerked his\n      shoulders, his arms, his whole body, like a man suddenly freed from cramp\n      or a suit of armour.",
                "He spoke, too, in a quick, crisp, rather high voice, pinching his\n      consonants a little, sharpening his vowels, like a true Welshman.",
                "\"My lord and misters the jury,\" he said: \"I was a hairdresser when the\n      call came on me to join the army. I had a little home and a wife. I never\n      thought what it would be like to be away from them, I surely never did;\n      and I'm ashamed to be speaking it out like this -- how it can squeeze\n      and squeeze a man, how it can prey on your mind, when you're nervous like\n      I am. 'Tis not everyone that cares for his home -- there's lots o' them\n      never wants to see their wives again. But for me 'tis like being shut up\n      in a cage, it is!\" Mr. Bosengate saw daylight between the skinny fingers\n      of the man's hand thrown out with a jerk. \"I cannot bear it shut up away\n      from wife and home like what you are in the army. So when I took my razor\n      that morning I was wild -- an' I wouldn't be here now but for that man\n      catching my hand. There was no reason in it, I'm willing to confess. It\n      was foolish; but wait till you get feeling like what I was, and see how it\n      draws you. Misters the jury, don't send me back to prison; it is worse\n      still there. If you have wives you will know what it is like for lots of\n      us; only some is more nervous than others. I swear to you, sirs, I could\n      not help it -- -?\" Again the little man flung out his hand, his whole\n      thin body shook and Mr. Bosengate felt the same sensation as when he drove\n      his car over a dog -- \"Misters the jury, I hope you may never in your\n      lives feel as I've been feeling.\"",
                "The little man ceased, his eyes shrank back into their sockets, his figure\n      back into its mask of shadowy brown and gleaming buttons, and Mr.\n      Bosengate was conscious that the judge was making a series of remarks;\n      and, very soon, of being seated at a mahogany table in the jury's\n      withdrawing room, hearing the voice of the man with hair like an Irish\n      terrier's saying: \"Didn't he talk through his hat, that little blighter!\"\n       Conscious, too, of the commercial traveller, still on his left -- always\n      on his left! -- mopping his brow, and muttering: \"Phew! It's hot in\n      there to-day!\" while an effluvium, as of an inside accustomed to whisky\n      came from him. Then the man with the underlip and the three plastered\n      wisps of hair said:",
                "\"Don't know why we withdrew, Mr. Foreman!\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate looked round to where, at the head of the table, Gentleman\n      Fox sat, in defensive gentility and the little white piping to his\n      waistcoat saying blandly:",
                "\"I shall be happy to take the sense of the jury.\"",
                "There was a short silence, then the chemist murmured:",
                "\"I should say he must have what they call claustrophobia.\"",
                "\"Clauster fiddlesticks! The feller's a shirker, that's all. Missed his\n      wife -- pretty excuse! Indecent, I call it!\"",
                "The speaker was the little wire-haired man; and emotion, deep and angry,\n      stirred in Mr. Bosengate. That ill-bred little cur! He gripped the edge of\n      the table with both hands.",
                "\"I think it's d --  -- -d natural!\" he muttered. But almost before\n      the words had left his lips he felt dismay. What had he said -- he,\n      nearly a colonel of volunteers -- endorsing such a want of patriotism!\n      And hearing the commercial traveller murmuring: \"'Ear, 'ear!\" he reddened\n      violently.",
                "The wire-headed man said roughly:",
                "\"There's too many of these blighted shirkers, and too much pampering of\n      them.\"",
                "The turmoil in Mr. Bosengate increased; he remarked in an icy voice:",
                "\"I agree to no verdict that'll send the man back to prison.\"",
                "At this a real tremor seemed to go round the table, as if they all saw\n      themselves sitting there through lunch time. Then the large grey-haired\n      man given to winking, said:",
                "\"Oh! Come, sir -- after what the judge said! Come, sir! What do you\n      say, Mr. Foreman?\"",
                "Gentleman Fox -- as who should say 'This is excellent value, but I\n      don't wish to press it on you!' -- answered:",
                "\"We are only concerned with the facts. Did he or did he not try to shorten\n      his life?\"",
                "\"Of course he did -- said so himself,\" Mr. Bosengate heard the\n      wire-haired man snap out, and from the following murmur of assent he alone\n      abstained. Guilty! Well -- yes! There was no way out of admitting that,\n      but his feelings revolted against handing \"that poor little beggar\" over\n      to the tender mercy of his country's law. His whole soul rose in arms\n      against agreeing with that ill-bred little cur, and the rest of this\n      job-lot. He had an impulse to get up and walk out, saying: \"Settle it your\n      own way. Good morning.\"",
                "\"It seems, sir,\" Gentleman Fox was saying, \"that we're all agreed to\n      guilty, except yourself. If you will allow me, I don't see how you can go\n      behind what the prisoner himself admitted.\"",
                "Thus brought up to the very guns, Mr. Bosengate, red in the face, thrust\n      his hands deep into the side pockets of his tunic, and, staring straight\n      before him, said:",
                "\"Very well; on condition we recommend him to mercy.\"",
                "\"What do you say, gentlemen; shall we recommend him to mercy?\"",
                "\"'Ear, 'ear!\" burst from the commercial traveller, and from the chemist\n      came the murmur:",
                "\"No harm in that.\"",
                "\"Well, I think there is. They shoot deserters at the front, and we let\n      this fellow off. I'd hang the cur.\"",
                "Mr. Bosengate stared at that little wire-haired brute. \"Haven't you any\n      feeling for others?\" he wanted to say. \"Can't you see that this poor devil\n      suffers tortures?\" But the sheer impossibility of doing this before ten\n      other men brought a slight sweat out on his face and hands; and in\n      agitation he smote the table a blow with his fist. The effect was\n      instantaneous. Everybody looked at the wire-haired man, as if saying:\n      \"Yes, you've gone a bit too far there!\" The \"little brute\" stood it for a\n      moment, then muttered surlily:",
                "\"Well, commend 'im to mercy if you like; I don't care.\"",
                "\"That's right; they never pay any attention to it,\" said the grey-haired\n      man, winking heartily. And Mr. Bosengate filed back with the others into\n      court.",
                "But when from the jury box his eyes fell once more on the hare-eyed figure\n      in the dock, he had his worst moment yet. Why should this poor wretch\n      suffer so -- for no fault, no fault; while he, and these others, and\n      that snapping counsel, and the Caesar-like judge up there, went off to\n      their women and their homes, blithe as bees, and probably never thought of\n      him again? And suddenly he was conscious of the judge's voice:",
                "\"You will go back to your regiment, and endeavour to serve your country\n      with better spirit. You may thank the jury that you are not sent to\n      prison, and your good fortune that you were not at the front when you\n      tried to commit this cowardly act. You are lucky to be alive.\"",
                "A policeman pulled the little soldier by the arm; his drab figure with\n      eyes fixed and lustreless, passed down and away. From his very soul Mr.\n      Bosengate wanted to lean out and say: \"Cheer up, cheer up! I understand.\"",
                "It was nearly ten o'clock that evening before he reached home, motoring\n      back from the route march. His physical tiredness was abated, for he had\n      partaken of a snack and a whisky and soda at the hotel; but mentally he\n      was in a curious mood. His body felt appeased, his spirit hungry. Tonight\n      he had a yearning, not for his wife's kisses, but for her understanding.\n      He wanted to go to her and say: \"I've learnt a lot to-day-found out things\n      I never thought of. Life's a wonderful thing, Kate, a thing one can't live\n      all to oneself; a thing one shares with everybody, so that when another\n      suffers, one suffers too. It's come to me that what one has doesn't matter\n      a bit -- it's what one does, and how one sympathises with other people.\n      It came to me in the most extraordinary vivid way, when I was on that\n      jury, watching that poor little rat of a soldier in his trap; it's the\n      first time I've ever felt -- the -- the spirit of Christ, you know.\n      It's a wonderful thing, Kate -- wonderful! We haven't been close -- really\n      close, you and I, so that we each understand what the other is feeling.\n      It's all in that, you know; understanding -- sympathy -- it's\n      priceless. When I saw that poor little devil taken down and sent back to\n      his regiment to begin his sorrows all over again -- wanting his wife,\n      thinking and thinking of her just as you know I would be thinking and\n      wanting you, I felt what an awful outside sort of life we lead, never\n      telling each other what we really think and feel, never being really\n      close. I daresay that little chap and his wife keep nothing from each\n      other -- live each other's lives. That's what we ought to do. Let's get\n      to feeling that what really matters is -- understanding and loving, and\n      not only just saying it as we all do, those fellows on the jury, and even\n      that poor devil of a judge -- what an awful life judging one's\n      fellow-creatures.",
                "\"When I left that poor little Tommy this morning, and ever since, I've\n      longed to get back here quietly to you and tell you about it, and make a\n      beginning. There's something wonderful in this, and I want you to feel it\n      as I do, because you mean such a lot to me.\"",
                "This was what he wanted to say to his wife, not touching, or kissing her,\n      just looking into her eyes, watching them soften and glow as they surely\n      must, catching the infection of his new ardour. And he felt unsteady,\n      fearfully unsteady with the desire to say it all as it should be said:\n      swiftly, quietly, with the truth and fervour of his feeling.",
                "The hall was not lit up, for daylight still lingered under the new\n      arrangement. He went towards the drawing-room, but from the very door\n      shied off to his study and stood irresolute under the picture of a \"Man\n      catching a flea\" (Dutch school), which had come down to him from his\n      father. The governess would be in there with his wife! He must wait.\n      Essential to go straight to Kathleen and pour it all out, or he would\n      never do it. He felt as nervous as an undergraduate going up for his viva'\n      voce. This thing was so big, so astoundingly and unexpectedly important.\n      He was suddenly afraid of his wife, afraid of her coolness and her grace,\n      and that something Japanese about her -- of all those attributes he had\n      been accustomed to admire most; afraid, as it were, of her attraction. He\n      felt young to-night, almost boyish; would she see that he was not really\n      fifteen years older than herself, and she not really a part of his\n      collection, of all the admirable appointments of his home; but a companion\n      spirit to one who wanted a companion badly. In this agitation of his soul\n      he could keep still no more than he could last night in the agitation of\n      his senses; and he wandered into the dining-room. A dainty supper was set\n      out there, sandwiches, and cake, whisky and the cigarettes -- even an\n      early peach. Mr. Bosengate looked at this peach with sorrow rather than\n      disgust. The perfection of it was of a piece with all that had gone before\n      this new and sudden feeling. Its delicious bloom seemed to heighten his\n      perception of the hedge around him, that hedge of the things he so\n      enjoyed, carefully planted and tended these many years. He passed it by\n      uneaten, and went to the window. Out there all was darkening, the\n      fountain, the lime tree, the flower-beds, and the fields below, with the\n      Jersey cows who would come to your call; darkening slowly, losing form,\n      blurring into soft blackness, vanishing, but there none the less -- all\n      there -- the hedge of his possessions. He heard the door of the\n      drawing-room open, the voices of his wife and the governess in the hall,\n      going up to bed. If only they didn't look in here! If only! The voices\n      ceased. He was safe now -- had but to follow in a few minutes, to make\n      sure of Kathleen alone. He turned round and stared down the length of the\n      dark dining-room, over the rosewood table, to where in the mirror above\n      the sideboard at the far end, his figure bathed, a stain, a mere blurred\n      shadow; he made his way down to it along the table edge, and stood before\n      himself as close as he could get. His throat and the roof of his mouth\n      felt dry with nervousness; he put out his finger and touched his face in\n      the glass. 'You're an ass!' he thought. 'Pull yourself together, and get\n      it over. She will see; of course she will!' He swallowed, smoothed his\n      moustache, and walked out. Going up the stairs, his heart beat painfully;\n      but he was in for it now, and marched straight into her room. Dressed only\n      in a loose blue wrapper, she was brushing her dark hair before the glass.\n      Mr. Bosengate went up to her and stood there silent, looking down. The\n      words he had thought of were like a swarm of bees buzzing in his head, yet\n      not one would fly from between his lips. His wife went on brushing her\n      hair under the light which shone on her polished elbows. She looked up at\n      him from beneath one lifted eyebrow.",
                "\"Well, dear -- tired?\"",
                "With a sort of vehemence the single word \"No\" passed out. A faint, a\n      quizzical smile flitted over her face; she shrugged her shoulders ever so\n      gently. That gesture -- he had seen it before! And in desperate desire\n      to make her understand, he put his hand on her lifted arm.",
                "\"Kathleen, stop -- listen to me!\" His fingers tightened in his\n      agitation and eagerness to make his great discovery known. But before he\n      could get out a word he became conscious of that cool round arm, conscious\n      of her eyes half-closed, sliding round at him, of her half-smiling lips,\n      of her neck under the wrapper. And he stammered:",
                "\"I want -- I must -- Kathleen, I -- -\"",
                "She lifted her shoulders again in that little shrug. \"Yes -- I know;\n      all right!\"",
                "A wave of heat and shame, and of God knows what came over Mr. Bosengate;\n      he fell on his knees and pressed his forehead to her arm; and he was\n      silent, more silent than the grave. Nothing -- nothing came from him\n      but two long sighs. Suddenly he felt her hand stroke his cheek -- compassionately,\n      it seemed to him. She made a little movement towards him; her lips met\n      his, and he remembered nothing but that....",
                "In his own room Mr. Bosengate sat at his wide open window, smoking a\n      cigarette; there was no light. Moths went past, the moon was creeping up.\n      He sat very calm, puffing the smoke out in to the night air. Curious\n      thing-life! Curious world! Curious forces in it -- making one do the\n      opposite of what one wished; always -- always making one do the\n      opposite, it seemed! The furtive light from that creeping moon was getting\n      hold of things down there, stealing in among the boughs of the trees.\n      'There's something ironical,' he thought, 'which walks about. Things don't\n      come off as you think they will. I meant, I tried but one doesn't change\n      like that all of a sudden, it seems. Fact is, life's too big a thing for\n      one! All the same, I'm not the man I was yesterday -- not quite!' He\n      closed his eyes, and in one of those flashes of vision which come when the\n      senses are at rest, he saw himself as it were far down below -- down on\n      the floor of a street narrow as a grave, high as a mountain, a deep dark\n      slit of a street walking down there, a black midget of a fellow, among\n      other black midgets -- his wife, and the little soldier, the judge, and\n      those jury chaps -- fantoches straight up on their tiny feet, wandering\n      down there in that dark, infinitely tall, and narrow street. 'Too much for\n      one!' he thought; 'Too high for one -- no getting on top of it. We've\n      got to be kind, and help one another, and not expect too much, and not\n      think too much. That's -- all!' And, squeezing out his cigarette, he\n      took six deep breaths of the night air, and got into bed."

                "I",
                "In the last day of May in the early 'nineties, about six o'clock of the\n      evening, old Jolyon Forsyte sat under the oak tree below the terrace of\n      his house at Robin Hill. He was waiting for the midges to bite him, before\n      abandoning the glory of the afternoon. His thin brown hand, where blue\n      veins stood out, held the end of a cigar in its tapering, long-nailed\n      fingers -- a pointed polished nail had survived with him from those\n      earlier Victorian days when to touch nothing, even with the tips of the\n      fingers, had been so distinguished. His domed forehead, great white\n      moustache, lean cheeks, and long lean jaw were covered from the westering\n      sunshine by an old brown Panama hat. His legs were crossed; in all his\n      attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance, as of an old man who every\n      morning put eau de Cologne upon his silk handkerchief. At his feet lay a\n      woolly brown-and-white dog trying to be a Pomeranian -- the dog\n      Balthasar between whom and old Jolyon primal aversion had changed into\n      attachment with the years. Close to his chair was a swing, and on the\n      swing was seated one of Holly's dolls -- called 'Duffer Alice' -- with\n      her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black\n      petticoat. She was never out of disgrace, so it did not matter to her how\n      she sat. Below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank, stretched to the\n      fernery, and, beyond that refinement, became fields, dropping to the pond,\n      the coppice, and the prospect -- 'Fine, remarkable' -- at which\n      Swithin Forsyte, from under this very tree, had stared five years ago when\n      he drove down with Irene to look at the house. Old Jolyon had heard of his\n      brother's exploit -- that drive which had become quite celebrated on\n      Forsyte 'Change. Swithin! And the fellow had gone and died, last November,\n      at the age of only seventy-nine, renewing the doubt whether Forsytes could\n      live for ever, which had first arisen when Aunt Ann passed away. Died! and\n      left only Jolyon and James, Roger and Nicholas and Timothy, Julia, Hester,\n      Susan! And old Jolyon thought: 'Eighty-five! I don't feel it -- except\n      when I get that pain.'",
                "His memory went searching. He had not felt his age since he had bought his\n      nephew Soames' ill-starred house and settled into it here at Robin Hill\n      over three years ago. It was as if he had been getting younger every\n      spring, living in the country with his son and his grandchildren -- June,\n      and the little ones of the second marriage, Jolly and Holly; living down\n      here out of the racket of London and the cackle of Forsyte 'Change,' free\n      of his boards, in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play, with\n      plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its\n      twenty acres, and in ministering to the whims of Holly and Jolly. All the\n      knots and crankiness, which had gathered in his heart during that long and\n      tragic business of June, Soames, Irene his wife, and poor young Bosinney,\n      had been smoothed out. Even June had thrown off her melancholy at last -- witness\n      this travel in Spain she was taking now with her father and her\n      stepmother. Curiously perfect peace was left by their departure; blissful,\n      yet blank, because his son was not there. Jo was never anything but a\n      comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays -- an amiable chap; but women,\n      somehow -- even the best -- got a little on one's nerves, unless of\n      course one admired them.",
                "Far-off a cuckoo called; a wood-pigeon was cooing from the first elm-tree\n      in the field, and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the\n      last mowing! The wind had got into the sou' west, too -- a delicious\n      air, sappy! He pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and\n      cheek. Somehow, to-day, he wanted company -- wanted a pretty face to\n      look at. People treated the old as if they wanted nothing. And with the\n      un-Forsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul, he thought:\n      'One's never had enough. With a foot in the grave one'll want something, I\n      shouldn't be surprised!' Down here -- away from the exigencies of\n      affairs -- his grandchildren, and the flowers, trees, birds of his\n      little domain, to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them, said,\n      'Open, sesame,' to him day and night. And sesame had opened -- how\n      much, perhaps, he did not know. He had always been responsive to what they\n      had begun to call 'Nature,' genuinely, almost religiously responsive,\n      though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view\n      a view, however deeply they might move him. But nowadays Nature actually\n      made him ache, he appreciated it so. Every one of these calm, bright,\n      lengthening days, with Holly's hand in his, and the dog Balthasar in front\n      looking studiously for what he never found, he would stroll, watching the\n      roses open, fruit budding on the walls, sunlight brightening the oak\n      leaves and saplings in the coppice, watching the water-lily leaves unfold\n      and glisten, and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field; listening\n      to the starlings and skylarks, and the Alderney cows chewing the cud,\n      flicking slow their tufted tails; and every one of these fine days he\n      ached a little from sheer love of it all, feeling perhaps, deep down, that\n      he had not very much longer to enjoy it. The thought that some day -- perhaps\n      not ten years hence, perhaps not five -- all this world would be taken\n      away from him, before he had exhausted his powers of loving it, seemed to\n      him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon. If anything\n      came after this life, it wouldn't be what he wanted; not Robin Hill, and\n      flowers and birds and pretty faces -- too few, even now, of those about\n      him! With the years his dislike of humbug had increased; the orthodoxy he\n      had worn in the 'sixties, as he had worn side-whiskers out of sheer\n      exuberance, had long dropped off, leaving him reverent before three things\n      alone -- beauty, upright conduct, and the sense of property; and the\n      greatest of these now was beauty. He had always had wide interests, and,\n      indeed could still read The Times, but he was liable at any moment to put\n      it down if he heard a blackbird sing. Upright conduct, property -- somehow,\n      they were tiring; the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him, only\n      gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them. Staring\n      into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and\n      white flowers on the lawn, a thought came to him: This weather was like\n      the music of 'Orfeo,' which he had recently heard at Covent Garden. A\n      beautiful opera, not like Meyerbeer, nor even quite Mozart, but, in its\n      way, perhaps even more lovely; something classical and of the Golden Age\n      about it, chaste and mellow, and the Ravogli 'almost worthy of the old\n      days' -- highest praise he could bestow. The yearning of Orpheus for\n      the beauty he was losing, for his love going down to Hades, as in life\n      love and beauty did go -- the yearning which sang and throbbed through\n      the golden music, stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that\n      evening. And with the tip of his cork-soled, elastic-sided boot he\n      involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog Balthasar, causing the animal to\n      wake and attack his fleas; for though he was supposed to have none,\n      nothing could persuade him of the fact. When he had finished he rubbed the\n      place he had been scratching against his master's calf, and settled down\n      again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot. And into old\n      Jolyon's mind came a sudden recollection -- a face he had seen at that\n      opera three weeks ago -- Irene, the wife of his precious nephew Soames,\n      that man of property! Though he had not met her since the day of the 'At\n      Home' in his old house at Stanhope Gate, which celebrated his\n      granddaughter June's ill-starred engagement to young Bosinney, he had\n      remembered her at once, for he had always admired her -- a very pretty\n      creature. After the death of young Bosinney, whose mistress she had so\n      reprehensibly become, he had heard that she had left Soames at once.\n      Goodness only knew what she had been doing since. That sight of her face -- a\n      side view -- in the row in front, had been literally the only reminder\n      these three years that she was still alive. No one ever spoke of her. And\n      yet Jo had told him something once -- something which had upset him\n      completely. The boy had got it from George Forsyte, he believed, who had\n      seen Bosinney in the fog the day he was run over -- something which\n      explained the young fellow's distress -- an act of Soames towards his\n      wife -- a shocking act. Jo had seen her, too, that afternoon, after the\n      news was out, seen her for a moment, and his description had always\n      lingered in old Jolyon's mind -- 'wild and lost' he had called her. And\n      next day June had gone there -- bottled up her feelings and gone there,\n      and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in\n      the night and vanished. A tragic business altogether! One thing was\n      certain -- Soames had never been able to lay hands on her again. And he\n      was living at Brighton, and journeying up and down -- a fitting fate,\n      the man of property! For when he once took a dislike to anyone -- as he\n      had to his nephew -- old Jolyon never got over it. He remembered still\n      the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of Irene's\n      disappearance. It had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that\n      house to which she must have wandered back, when Jo saw her, wandered back\n      for a moment -- like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that\n      news, 'Tragic death of an Architect,' in the street. Her face had struck\n      him very much the other night -- more beautiful than he had remembered,\n      but like a mask, with something going on beneath it. A young woman still -- twenty-eight\n      perhaps. Ah, well! Very likely she had another lover by now. But at this\n      subversive thought -- for married women should never love: once, even,\n      had been too much -- his instep rose, and with it the dog Balthasar's\n      head. The sagacious animal stood up and looked into old Jolyon's face.\n      'Walk?' he seemed to say; and old Jolyon answered: \"Come on, old chap!\"",
                "Slowly, as was their wont, they crossed among the constellations of\n      buttercups and daisies, and entered the fernery. This feature, where very\n      little grew as yet, had been judiciously dropped below the level of the\n      lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and\n      give the impression of irregularity, so important in horticulture. Its\n      rocks and earth were beloved of the dog Balthasar, who sometimes found a\n      mole there. Old Jolyon made a point of passing through it because, though\n      it was not beautiful, he intended that it should be, some day, and he\n      would think: 'I must get Varr to come down and look at it; he's better\n      than Beech.' For plants, like houses and human complaints, required the\n      best expert consideration. It was inhabited by snails, and if accompanied\n      by his grandchildren, he would point to one and tell them the story of the\n      little boy who said: 'Have plummers got leggers, Mother? 'No, sonny.'\n      'Then darned if I haven't been and swallowed a snileybob.' And when they\n      skipped and clutched his hand, thinking of the snileybob going down the\n      little boy's 'red lane,' his eyes would twinkle. Emerging from the\n      fernery, he opened the wicket gate, which just there led into the first\n      field, a large and park-like area, out of which, within brick walls, the\n      vegetable garden had been carved. Old Jolyon avoided this, which did not\n      suit his mood, and made down the hill towards the pond. Balthasar, who\n      knew a water-rat or two, gambolled in front, at the gait which marks an\n      oldish dog who takes the same walk every day. Arrived at the edge, old\n      Jolyon stood, noting another water-lily opened since yesterday; he would\n      show it to Holly to-morrow, when 'his little sweet' had got over the upset\n      which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunch -- her little\n      arrangements were very delicate. Now that Jolly had gone to school -- his\n      first term -- Holly was with him nearly all day long, and he missed her\n      badly. He felt that pain too, which often bothered him now, a little\n      dragging at his left side. He looked back up the hill. Really, poor young\n      Bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house; he would have done\n      very well for himself if he had lived! And where was he now? Perhaps,\n      still haunting this, the site of his last work, of his tragic love affair.\n      Or was Philip Bosinney's spirit diffused in the general? Who could say?\n      That dog was getting his legs muddy! And he moved towards the coppice.\n      There had been the most delightful lot of bluebells, and he knew where\n      some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the\n      trees, away out of the sun. He passed the cow-houses and the hen-houses\n      there installed, and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings, making\n      for one of the bluebell plots. Balthasar, preceding him once more, uttered\n      a low growl. Old Jolyon stirred him with his foot, but the dog remained\n      motionless, just where there was no room to pass, and the hair rose slowly\n      along the centre of his woolly back. Whether from the growl and the look\n      of the dog's stivered hair, or from the sensation which a man feels in a\n      wood, old Jolyon also felt something move along his spine. And then the\n      path turned, and there was an old mossy log, and on it a woman sitting.\n      Her face was turned away, and he had just time to think: 'She's\n      trespassing -- I must have a board put up!' before she turned. Powers\n      above! The face he had seen at the opera -- the very woman he had just\n      been thinking of! In that confused moment he saw things blurred, as if a\n      spirit -- queer effect -- the slant of sunlight perhaps on her\n      violet-grey frock! And then she rose and stood smiling, her head a little\n      to one side. Old Jolyon thought: 'How pretty she is!' She did not speak,\n      neither did he; and he realized why with a certain admiration. She was\n      here no doubt because of some memory, and did not mean to try and get out\n      of it by vulgar explanation.",
                "\"Don't let that dog touch your frock,\" he said; \"he's got wet feet. Come\n      here, you!\"",
                "But the dog Balthasar went on towards the visitor, who put her hand down\n      and stroked his head. Old Jolyon said quickly:",
                "\"I saw you at the opera the other night; you didn't notice me.\"",
                "\"Oh, yes! I did.\"",
                "He felt a subtle flattery in that, as though she had added: 'Do you think\n      one could miss seeing you?'",
                "\"They're all in Spain,\" he remarked abruptly. \"I'm alone; I drove up for\n      the opera. The Ravogli's good. Have you seen the cow-houses?\"",
                "In a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he\n      moved instinctively towards that bit of property, and she moved beside\n      him. Her figure swayed faintly, like the best kind of French figures; her\n      dress, too, was a sort of French grey. He noticed two or three silver\n      threads in her amber-coloured hair, strange hair with those dark eyes of\n      hers, and that creamy-pale face. A sudden sidelong look from the velvety\n      brown eyes disturbed him. It seemed to come from deep and far, from\n      another world almost, or at all events from some one not living very much\n      in this. And he said mechanically:",
                "\"Where are you living now?\"",
                "\"I have a little flat in Chelsea.\"",
                "He did not want to hear what she was doing, did not want to hear anything;\n      but the perverse word came out:",
                "\"Alone?\"",
                "She nodded. It was a relief to know that. And it came into his mind that,\n      but for a twist of fate, she would have been mistress of this coppice,\n      showing these cow-houses to him, a visitor.",
                "\"All Alderneys,\" he muttered; \"they give the best milk. This one's a\n      pretty creature. Woa, Myrtle!\"",
                "The fawn-coloured cow, with eyes as soft and brown as Irene's own, was\n      standing absolutely still, not having long been milked. She looked round\n      at them out of the corner of those lustrous, mild, cynical eyes, and from\n      her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the\n      straw. The scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of\n      the cool cow-house; and old Jolyon said:",
                "\"You must come up and have some dinner with me. I'll send you home in the\n      carriage.\"",
                "He perceived a struggle going on within her; natural, no doubt, with her\n      memories. But he wanted her company; a pretty face, a charming figure,\n      beauty! He had been alone all the afternoon. Perhaps his eyes were\n      wistful, for she answered: \"Thank you, Uncle Jolyon. I should like to.\"",
                "He rubbed his hands, and said:",
                "\"Capital! Let's go up, then!\" And, preceded by the dog Balthasar, they\n      ascended through the field. The sun was almost level in their faces now,\n      and he could see, not only those silver threads, but little lines, just\n      deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coin-like fineness -- the\n      special look of life unshared with others. \"I'll take her in by the\n      terrace,\" he thought: \"I won't make a common visitor of her.\"",
                "\"What do you do all day?\" he said.",
                "\"Teach music; I have another interest, too.\"",
                "\"Work!\" said old Jolyon, picking up the doll from off the swing, and\n      smoothing its black petticoat. \"Nothing like it, is there? I don't do any\n      now. I'm getting on. What interest is that?\"",
                "\"Trying to help women who've come to grief.\" Old Jolyon did not quite\n      understand. \"To grief?\" he repeated; then realised with a shock that she\n      meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that\n      expression. Assisting the Magdalenes of London! What a weird and\n      terrifying interest! And, curiosity overcoming his natural shrinking, he\n      asked:",
                "\"Why? What do you do for them?\"",
                "\"Not much. I've no money to spare. I can only give sympathy and food\n      sometimes.\"",
                "Involuntarily old Jolyon's hand sought his purse. He said hastily: \"How\n      d'you get hold of them?\"",
                "\"I go to a hospital.\"",
                "\"A hospital! Phew!\"",
                "\"What hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of beauty.\"",
                "Old Jolyon straightened the doll. \"Beauty!\" he ejaculated: \"Ha! Yes! A sad\n      business!\" and he moved towards the house. Through a French window, under\n      sun-blinds not yet drawn up, he preceded her into the room where he was\n      wont to study The Times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine, with\n      huge illustrations of mangold wurzels, and the like, which provided Holly\n      with material for her paint brush.",
                "\"Dinner's in half an hour. You'd like to wash your hands! I'll take you to\n      June's room.\"",
                "He saw her looking round eagerly; what changes since she had last visited\n      this house with her husband, or her lover, or both perhaps -- he did\n      not know, could not say! All that was dark, and he wished to leave it so.\n      But what changes! And in the hall he said:",
                "\"My boy Jo's a painter, you know. He's got a lot of taste. It isn't mine,\n      of course, but I've let him have his way.\"",
                "She was standing very still, her eyes roaming through the hall and music\n      room, as it now was -- all thrown into one, under the great skylight.\n      Old Jolyon had an odd impression of her. Was she trying to conjure\n      somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all\n      pearl-grey and silver? He would have had gold himself; more lively and\n      solid. But Jo had French tastes, and it had come out shadowy like that,\n      with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking,\n      broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour. It was\n      not his dream! Mentally he had hung this space with those gold-framed\n      masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when\n      quantity was precious. And now where were they? Sold for a song! That\n      something which made him, alone among Forsytes, move with the times had\n      warned him against the struggle to retain them. But in his study he still\n      had 'Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.'",
                "He began to mount the stairs with her, slowly, for he felt his side.",
                "\"These are the bathrooms,\" he said, \"and other arrangements. I've had them\n      tiled. The nurseries are along there. And this is Jo's and his wife's.\n      They all communicate. But you remember, I expect.\"",
                "Irene nodded. They passed on, up the gallery and entered a large room with\n      a small bed, and several windows.",
                "\"This is mine,\" he said. The walls were covered with the photographs of\n      children and watercolour sketches, and he added doubtfully:",
                "\"These are Jo's. The view's first-rate. You can see the Grand Stand at\n      Epsom in clear weather.\"",
                "The sun was down now, behind the house, and over the 'prospect' a luminous\n      haze had settled, emanation of the long and prosperous day. Few houses\n      showed, but fields and trees faintly glistened, away to a loom of downs.",
                "\"The country's changing,\" he said abruptly, \"but there it'll be when we're\n      all gone. Look at those thrushes -- the birds are sweet here in the\n      mornings. I'm glad to have washed my hands of London.\"",
                "Her face was close to the window pane, and he was struck by its mournful\n      look. 'Wish I could make her look happy!' he thought. 'A pretty face, but\n      sad!' And taking up his can of hot water he went out into the gallery.",
                "\"This is June's room,\" he said, opening the next door and putting the can\n      down; \"I think you'll find everything.\" And closing the door behind her he\n      went back to his own room. Brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes,\n      and dabbing his forehead with eau de Cologne, he mused. She had come so\n      strangely -- a sort of visitation; mysterious, even romantic, as if his\n      desire for company, for beauty, had been fulfilled by whatever it was\n      which fulfilled that sort of thing. And before the mirror he straightened\n      his still upright figure, passed the brushes over his great white\n      moustache, touched up his eyebrows with eau de Cologne, and rang the bell.",
                "\"I forgot to let them know that I have a lady to dinner with me. Let cook\n      do something extra, and tell Beacon to have the landau and pair at\n      half-past ten to drive her back to Town to-night. Is Miss Holly asleep?\"",
                "The maid thought not. And old Jolyon, passing down the gallery, stole on\n      tiptoe towards the nursery, and opened the door whose hinges he kept\n      specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without\n      being heard.",
                "But Holly was asleep, and lay like a miniature Madonna, of that type which\n      the old painters could not tell from Venus, when they had completed her.\n      Her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks; on her face was perfect peace -- her\n      little arrangements were evidently all right again. And old Jolyon, in the\n      twilight of the room, stood adoring her! It was so charming, solemn, and\n      loving -- that little face. He had more than his share of the blessed\n      capacity of living again in the young. They were to him his future life -- all\n      of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted. There\n      she was with everything before her, and his blood -- some of it -- in\n      her tiny veins. There she was, his little companion, to be made as happy\n      as ever he could make her, so that she knew nothing but love. His heart\n      swelled, and he went out, stilling the sound of his patent-leather boots.\n      In the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him: To think that children\n      should come to that which Irene had told him she was helping! Women who\n      were all, once, little things like this one sleeping there! 'I must give\n      her a cheque!' he mused; 'Can't bear to think of them!' They had never\n      borne reflecting on, those poor outcasts; wounding too deeply the core of\n      true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to the sense of property -- wounding\n      too grievously the deepest thing in him -- a love of beauty which could\n      give him, even now, a flutter of the heart, thinking of his evening in the\n      society of a pretty woman. And he went downstairs, through the swinging\n      doors, to the back regions. There, in the wine-cellar, was a hock worth at\n      least two pounds a bottle, a Steinberg Cabinet, better than any\n      Johannisberg that ever went down throat; a wine of perfect bouquet, sweet\n      as a nectarine -- nectar indeed! He got a bottle out, handling it like\n      a baby, and holding it level to the light, to look. Enshrined in its coat\n      of dust, that mellow coloured, slender-necked bottle gave him deep\n      pleasure. Three years to settle down again since the move from Town -- ought\n      to be in prime condition! Thirty-five years ago he had bought it -- thank\n      God he had kept his palate, and earned the right to drink it. She would\n      appreciate this; not a spice of acidity in a dozen. He wiped the bottle,\n      drew the cork with his own hands, put his nose down, inhaled its perfume,\n      and went back to the music room.",
                "Irene was standing by the piano; she had taken off her hat and a lace\n      scarf she had been wearing, so that her gold-coloured hair was visible,\n      and the pallor of her neck. In her grey frock she made a pretty picture\n      for old Jolyon, against the rosewood of the piano.",
                "He gave her his arm, and solemnly they went. The room, which had been\n      designed to enable twenty-four people to dine in comfort, held now but a\n      little round table. In his present solitude the big dining-table oppressed\n      old Jolyon; he had caused it to be removed till his son came back. Here in\n      the company of two really good copies of Raphael Madonnas he was wont to\n      dine alone. It was the only disconsolate hour of his day, this summer\n      weather. He had never been a large eater, like that great chap Swithin, or\n      Sylvanus Heythorp, or Anthony Thornworthy, those cronies of past times;\n      and to dine alone, overlooked by the Madonnas, was to him but a sorrowful\n      occupation, which he got through quickly, that he might come to the more\n      spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar. But this evening was a\n      different matter! His eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he\n      spoke of Italy and Switzerland, telling her stories of his travels there,\n      and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and\n      grand-daughter because they knew them. This fresh audience was precious to\n      him; he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round\n      the fields of reminiscence. Himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive,\n      he instinctively avoided fatiguing others, and his natural flirtatiousness\n      towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman. He\n      would have liked to draw her out, but though she murmured and smiled and\n      seemed to be enjoying what he told her, he remained conscious of that\n      mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination. He could not\n      bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you, and chattered away;\n      or hard-mouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did.\n      There was only one quality in a woman that appealed to him -- charm;\n      and the quieter it was, the more he liked it. And this one had charm,\n      shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those Italian hills and valleys he had\n      loved. The feeling, too, that she was, as it were, apart, cloistered, made\n      her seem nearer to himself, a strangely desirable companion. When a man is\n      very old and quite out of the running, he loves to feel secure from the\n      rivalries of youth, for he would still be first in the heart of beauty.\n      And he drank his hock, and watched her lips, and felt nearly young. But\n      the dog Balthasar lay watching her lips too, and despising in his heart\n      the interruptions of their talk, and the tilting of those greenish glasses\n      full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him.",
                "The light was just failing when they went back into the music-room. And,\n      cigar in mouth, old Jolyon said:",
                "\"Play me some Chopin.\"",
                "By the cigars they smoke, and the composers they love, ye shall know the\n      texture of men's souls. Old Jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or\n      Wagner's music. He loved Beethoven and Mozart, Handel and Gluck, and\n      Schumann, and, for some occult reason, the operas of Meyerbeer; but of\n      late years he had been seduced by Chopin, just as in painting he had\n      succumbed to Botticelli. In yielding to these tastes he had been conscious\n      of divergence from the standard of the Golden Age. Their poetry was not\n      that of Milton and Byron and Tennyson; of Raphael and Titian; Mozart and\n      Beethoven. It was, as it were, behind a veil; their poetry hit no one in\n      the face, but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted,\n      and melted up the heart. And, never certain that this was healthy, he did\n      not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the\n      music of the other.",
                "Irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with\n      pearl-grey, and old Jolyon, in an armchair, whence he could see her,\n      crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar. She sat a few moments with\n      her hands on the keys, evidently searching her mind for what to give him.\n      Then she began and within old Jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure, not\n      quite like anything else in the world. He fell slowly into a trance,\n      interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at\n      long intervals, and replacing it. She was there, and the hock within him,\n      and the scent of tobacco; but there, too, was a world of sunshine\n      lingering into moonlight, and pools with storks upon them, and bluish\n      trees above, glowing with blurs of wine-red roses, and fields of lavender\n      where milk-white cows were grazing, and a woman all shadowy, with dark\n      eyes and a white neck, smiled, holding out her arms; and through air which\n      was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cow's horn. He opened\n      his eyes. Beautiful piece; she played well -- the touch of an angel!\n      And he closed them again. He felt miraculously sad and happy, as one does,\n      standing under a lime-tree in full honey flower. Not live one's own life\n      again, but just stand there and bask in the smile of a woman's eyes, and\n      enjoy the bouquet! And he jerked his hand; the dog Balthasar had reached\n      up and licked it.",
                "\"Beautiful!\" He said: \"Go on -- more Chopin!\"",
                "She began to play again. This time the resemblance between her and\n      'Chopin' struck him. The swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her\n      playing too, and the Nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her\n      eyes, the light on her hair, as of moonlight from a golden moon.\n      Seductive, yes; but nothing of Delilah in her or in that music. A long\n      blue spiral from his cigar ascended and dispersed. 'So we go out!' he\n      thought. 'No more beauty! Nothing?'",
                "Again Irene stopped.",
                "\"Would you like some Gluck? He used to write his music in a sunlit garden,\n      with a bottle of Rhine wine beside him.\"",
                "\"Ah! yes. Let's have 'Orfeo.'.rdquo; Round about him now were fields of gold and\n      silver flowers, white forms swaying in the sunlight, bright birds flying\n      to and fro. All was summer. Lingering waves of sweetness and regret\n      flooded his soul. Some cigar ash dropped, and taking out a silk\n      handkerchief to brush it off, he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and\n      eau de Cologne. 'Ah!' he thought, 'Indian summer -- that's all!' and he\n      said: \"You haven't played me 'Che faro.'.rdquo;",
                "She did not answer; did not move. He was conscious of something -- some\n      strange upset. Suddenly he saw her rise and turn away, and a pang of\n      remorse shot through him. What a clumsy chap! Like Orpheus, she of course -- she\n      too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory! And disturbed to\n      the heart, he got up from his chair. She had gone to the great window at\n      the far end. Gingerly he followed. Her hands were folded over her breast;\n      he could just see her cheek, very white. And, quite emotionalized, he\n      said:",
                "\"There, there, my love!\" The words had escaped him mechanically, for they\n      were those he used to Holly when she had a pain, but their effect was\n      instantaneously distressing. She raised her arms, covered her face with\n      them, and wept.",
                "Old Jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age. The\n      passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment, so unlike the\n      control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before\n      broken down in the presence of another being.",
                "\"There, there -- there, there!\" he murmured, and putting his hand out\n      reverently, touched her. She turned, and leaned the arms which covered her\n      face against him. Old Jolyon stood very still, keeping one thin hand on\n      her shoulder. Let her cry her heart out -- it would do her good.",
                "And the dog Balthasar, puzzled, sat down on his stern to examine them.",
                "The window was still open, the curtains had not been drawn, the last of\n      daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within;\n      there was a scent of new-mown grass. With the wisdom of a long life old\n      Jolyon did not speak. Even grief sobbed itself out in time; only Time was\n      good for sorrow -- Time who saw the passing of each mood, each emotion\n      in turn; Time the layer-to-rest. There came into his mind the words: 'As\n      panteth the hart after cooling streams' -- but they were of no use to\n      him. Then, conscious of a scent of violets, he knew she was drying her\n      eyes. He put his chin forward, pressed his moustache against her forehead,\n      and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body, as of a tree which\n      shakes itself free of raindrops. She put his hand to her lips, as if\n      saying: \"All over now! Forgive me!\"",
                "The kiss filled him with a strange comfort; he led her back to where she\n      had been so upset. And the dog Balthasar, following, laid the bone of one\n      of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet.",
                "Anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion, he could think of\n      nothing better than china; and moving with her slowly from cabinet to\n      cabinet, he kept taking up bits of Dresden and Lowestoft and Chelsea,\n      turning them round and round with his thin, veined hands, whose skin,\n      faintly freckled, had such an aged look.",
                "\"I bought this at Jobson's,\" he would say; \"cost me thirty pounds. It's\n      very old. That dog leaves his bones all over the place. This old\n      'ship-bowl' I picked up at the sale when that precious rip, the Marquis,\n      came to grief. But you don't remember. Here's a nice piece of Chelsea.\n      Now, what would you say this was?\" And he was comforted, feeling that,\n      with her taste, she was taking a real interest in these things; for, after\n      all, nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china.",
                "When the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last, he said:",
                "\"You must come again; you must come to lunch, then I can show you these by\n      daylight, and my little sweet -- she's a dear little thing. This dog\n      seems to have taken a fancy to you.\"",
                "For Balthasar, feeling that she was about to leave, was rubbing his side\n      against her leg. Going out under the porch with her, he said:",
                "\"He'll get you up in an hour and a quarter. Take this for your protegees,\"\n       and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand. He saw her\n      brightened eyes, and heard her murmur: \"Oh! Uncle Jolyon!\" and a real\n      throb of pleasure went through him. That meant one or two poor creatures\n      helped a little, and it meant that she would come again. He put his hand\n      in at the window and grasped hers once more. The carriage rolled away. He\n      stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees, and thought: 'A\n      sweet night! She...!'",
                "II",
                "Two days of rain, and summer set in bland and sunny. Old Jolyon walked and\n      talked with Holly. At first he felt taller and full of a new vigour; then\n      he felt restless. Almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice, and\n      walk as far as the log. 'Well, she's not there!' he would think, 'of\n      course not!' And he would feel a little shorter, and drag his feet walking\n      up the hill home, with his hand clapped to his left side. Now and then the\n      thought would move in him: 'Did she come -- or did I dream it?' and he\n      would stare at space, while the dog Balthasar stared at him. Of course she\n      would not come again! He opened the letters from Spain with less\n      excitement. They were not returning till July; he felt, oddly, that he\n      could bear it. Every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at\n      where she had sat. She was not there, so he unscrewed his eyes again.",
                "On the seventh afternoon he thought: 'I must go up and get some boots.' He\n      ordered Beacon, and set out. Passing from Putney towards Hyde Park he\n      reflected: 'I might as well go to Chelsea and see her.' And he called out:\n      \"Just drive me to where you took that lady the other night.\" The coachman\n      turned his broad red face, and his juicy lips answered: \"The lady in grey,\n      sir?\"",
                "\"Yes, the lady in grey.\" What other ladies were there! Stodgy chap!",
                "The carriage stopped before a small three-storied block of flats, standing\n      a little back from the river. With a practised eye old Jolyon saw that\n      they were cheap. 'I should think about sixty pound a year,' he mused; and\n      entering, he looked at the name-board. The name 'Forsyte' was not on it,\n      but against 'First Floor, Flat C' were the words: 'Mrs. Irene Heron.' Ah!\n      She had taken her maiden name again! And somehow this pleased him. He went\n      upstairs slowly, feeling his side a little. He stood a moment, before\n      ringing, to lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there. She would not\n      be in! And then -- Boots! The thought was black. What did he want with\n      boots at his age? He could not wear out all those he had.",
                "\"Your mistress at home?\"",
                "\"Yes, sir.\"",
                "\"Say Mr. Jolyon Forsyte.\"",
                "\"Yes, sir, will you come this way?\"",
                "Old Jolyon followed a very little maid -- not more than sixteen one\n      would say -- into a very small drawing-room where the sun-blinds were\n      drawn. It held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and\n      good taste. He stood in the middle, with his top hat in his hand, and\n      thought: 'I expect she's very badly off!' There was a mirror above the\n      fireplace, and he saw himself reflected. An old-looking chap! He heard a\n      rustle, and turned round. She was so close that his moustache almost\n      brushed her forehead, just under her hair.",
                "\"I was driving up,\" he said. \"Thought I'd look in on you, and ask you how\n      you got up the other night.\"",
                "And, seeing her smile, he felt suddenly relieved. She was really glad to\n      see him, perhaps.",
                "\"Would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the Park?\"",
                "But while she was gone to put her hat on, he frowned. The Park! James and\n      Emily! Mrs. Nicholas, or some other member of his precious family would be\n      there very likely, prancing up and down. And they would go and wag their\n      tongues about having seen him with her, afterwards. Better not! He did not\n      wish to revive the echoes of the past on Forsyte 'Change. He removed a\n      white hair from the lapel of his closely-buttoned-up frock coat, and\n      passed his hand over his cheeks, moustache, and square chin. It felt very\n      hollow there under the cheekbones. He had not been eating much lately -- he\n      had better get that little whippersnapper who attended Holly to give him a\n      tonic. But she had come back and when they were in the carriage, he said:",
                "\"Suppose we go and sit in Kensington Gardens instead?\" and added with a\n      twinkle: \"No prancing up and down there,\" as if she had been in the secret\n      of his thoughts.",
                "Leaving the carriage, they entered those select precincts, and strolled\n      towards the water.",
                "\"You've gone back to your maiden name, I see,\" he said: \"I'm not sorry.\"",
                "She slipped her hand under his arm: \"Has June forgiven me, Uncle Jolyon?\"",
                "He answered gently: \"Yes -- yes; of course, why not?\"",
                "\"And have you?\"",
                "\"I? I forgave you as soon as I saw how the land really lay.\" And perhaps\n      he had; his instinct had always been to forgive the beautiful.",
                "She drew a deep breath. \"I never regretted -- I couldn't. Did you ever\n      love very deeply, Uncle Jolyon?\"",
                "At that strange question old Jolyon stared before him. Had he? He did not\n      seem to remember that he ever had. But he did not like to say this to the\n      young woman whose hand was touching his arm, whose life was suspended, as\n      it were, by memory of a tragic love. And he thought: 'If I had met you\n      when I was young I -- I might have made a fool of myself, perhaps.' And\n      a longing to escape in generalities beset him.",
                "\"Love's a queer thing,\" he said, \"fatal thing often. It was the Greeks -- wasn't\n      it? -- made love into a goddess; they were right, I dare say, but then\n      they lived in the Golden Age.\"",
                "\"Phil adored them.\"",
                "Phil! The word jarred him, for suddenly -- with his power to see all\n      round a thing, he perceived why she was putting up with him like this. She\n      wanted to talk about her lover! Well! If it was any pleasure to her! And\n      he said: \"Ah! There was a bit of the sculptor in him, I fancy.\"",
                "\"Yes. He loved balance and symmetry; he loved the whole-hearted way the\n      Greeks gave themselves to art.\"",
                "Balance! The chap had no balance at all, if he remembered; as for symmetry -- clean-built\n      enough he was, no doubt; but those queer eyes of his, and high cheek-bones -- Symmetry?",
                "\"You're of the Golden Age, too, Uncle Jolyon.\"",
                "Old Jolyon looked round at her. Was she chaffing him? No, her eyes were\n      soft as velvet. Was she flattering him? But if so, why? There was nothing\n      to be had out of an old chap like him.",
                "\"Phil thought so. He used to say: 'But I can never tell him that I admire\n      him.'.rdquo;",
                "Ah! There it was again. Her dead lover; her desire to talk of him! And he\n      pressed her arm, half resentful of those memories, half grateful, as if he\n      recognised what a link they were between herself and him.",
                "\"He was a very talented young fellow,\" he murmured. \"It's hot; I feel the\n      heat nowadays. Let's sit down.\"",
                "They took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves covered\n      them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon. A pleasure to sit there and\n      watch her, and feel that she liked to be with him. And the wish to\n      increase that liking, if he could, made him go on:",
                "\"I expect he showed you a side of him I never saw. He'd be at his best\n      with you. His ideas of art were a little new -- to me \" -- he had\n      stiffed the word 'fangled.'",
                "\"Yes: but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty.\" Old Jolyon\n      thought: 'The devil he did!' but answered with a twinkle: \"Well, I have,\n      or I shouldn't be sitting here with you.\" She was fascinating when she\n      smiled with her eyes, like that!",
                "\"He thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old. Phil had real\n      insight.\"",
                "He was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past, out of a\n      longing to talk of her dead lover -- not a bit; and yet it was precious\n      to hear, because she pleased his eyes and heart which -- quite true! -- had\n      never grown old. Was that because -- unlike her and her dead lover, he\n      had never loved to desperation, had always kept his balance, his sense of\n      symmetry. Well! It had left him power, at eighty-four, to admire beauty.\n      And he thought, 'If I were a painter or a sculptor! But I'm an old chap.\n      Make hay while the sun shines.'",
                "A couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them, at the edge\n      of the shadow from their tree. The sunlight fell cruelly on their pale,\n      squashed, unkempt young faces. \"We're an ugly lot!\" said old Jolyon\n      suddenly. \"It amazes me to see how -- love triumphs over that.\"",
                "\"Love triumphs over everything!\"",
                "\"The young think so,\" he muttered.",
                "\"Love has no age, no limit, and no death.\"",
                "With that glow in her pale face, her breast heaving, her eyes so large and\n      dark and soft, she looked like Venus come to life! But this extravagance\n      brought instant reaction, and, twinkling, he said: \"Well, if it had\n      limits, we shouldn't be born; for by George! it's got a lot to put up\n      with.\"",
                "Then, removing his top hat, he brushed it round with a cuff. The great\n      clumsy thing heated his forehead; in these days he often got a rush of\n      blood to the head -- his circulation was not what it had been.",
                "She still sat gazing straight before her, and suddenly she murmured:",
                "\"It's strange enough that I'm alive.\"",
                "Those words of Jo's 'Wild and lost' came back to him.",
                "\"Ah!\" he said: \"my son saw you for a moment -- that day.\"",
                "\"Was it your son? I heard a voice in the hall; I thought for a second it\n      was -- Phil.\"",
                "Old Jolyon saw her lips tremble. She put her hand over them, took it away\n      again, and went on calmly: \"That night I went to the Embankment; a woman\n      caught me by the dress. She told me about herself. When one knows that\n      others suffer, one's ashamed.\"",
                "\"One of those?\"",
                "She nodded, and horror stirred within old Jolyon, the horror of one who\n      has never known a struggle with desperation. Almost against his will he\n      muttered: \"Tell me, won't you?\"",
                "\"I didn't care whether I lived or died. When you're like that, Fate ceases\n      to want to kill you. She took care of me three days -- she never left\n      me. I had no money. That's why I do what I can for them, now.\"",
                "But old Jolyon was thinking: 'No money!' What fate could compare with\n      that? Every other was involved in it.",
                "\"I wish you had come to me,\" he said. \"Why didn't you?\" But Irene did not\n      answer.",
                "\"Because my name was Forsyte, I suppose? Or was it June who kept you away?\n      How are you getting on now?\" His eyes involuntarily swept her body.\n      Perhaps even now she was -- ! And yet she wasn't thin -- not really!",
                "\"Oh! with my fifty pounds a year, I make just enough.\" The answer did not\n      reassure him; he had lost confidence. And that fellow Soames! But his\n      sense of justice stifled condemnation. No, she would certainly have died\n      rather than take another penny from him. Soft as she looked, there must be\n      strength in her somewhere -- strength and fidelity. But what business\n      had young Bosinney to have got run over and left her stranded like this!",
                "\"Well, you must come to me now,\" he said, \"for anything you want, or I\n      shall be quite cut up.\" And putting on his hat, he rose. \"Let's go and get\n      some tea. I told that lazy chap to put the horses up for an hour, and come\n      for me at your place. We'll take a cab presently; I can't walk as I used\n      to.\"",
                "He enjoyed that stroll to the Kensington end of the gardens -- the\n      sound of her voice, the glancing of her eyes, the subtle beauty of a\n      charming form moving beside him. He enjoyed their tea at Ruffel's in the\n      High Street, and came out thence with a great box of chocolates swung on\n      his little finger. He enjoyed the drive back to Chelsea in a hansom,\n      smoking his cigar. She had promised to come down next Sunday and play to\n      him again, and already in thought he was plucking carnations and early\n      roses for her to carry back to town. It was a pleasure to give her a\n      little pleasure, if it WERE pleasure from an old chap like him! The\n      carriage was already there when they arrived. Just like that fellow, who\n      was always late when he was wanted! Old Jolyon went in for a minute to say\n      good-bye. The little dark hall of the flat was impregnated with a\n      disagreeable odour of patchouli, and on a bench against the wall -- its\n      only furniture -- he saw a figure sitting. He heard Irene say softly:\n      \"Just one minute.\" In the little drawing-room when the door was shut, he\n      asked gravely: \"One of your protegees?\"",
                "\"Yes. Now thanks to you, I can do something for her.\"",
                "He stood, staring, and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so\n      many in its time. The idea of her thus actually in contact with this\n      outcast grieved and frightened him. What could she do for them? Nothing.\n      Only soil and make trouble for herself, perhaps. And he said: \"Take care,\n      my dear! The world puts the worst construction on everything.\"",
                "\"I know that.\"",
                "He was abashed by her quiet smile. \"Well then -- Sunday,\" he murmured:\n      \"Good-bye.\"",
                "She put her cheek forward for him to kiss.",
                "\"Good-bye,\" he said again; \"take care of yourself.\" And he went out, not\n      looking towards the figure on the bench. He drove home by way of\n      Hammersmith; that he might stop at a place he knew of and tell them to\n      send her in two dozen of their best Burgundy. She must want picking-up\n      sometimes! Only in Richmond Park did he remember that he had gone up to\n      order himself some boots, and was surprised that he could have had so\n      paltry an idea.",
                "III",
                "The little spirits of the past which throng an old man's days had never\n      pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy hours elapsing\n      before Sunday came. The spirit of the future, with the charm of the\n      unknown, put up her lips instead. Old Jolyon was not restless now, and\n      paid no visits to the log, because she was coming to lunch. There is\n      wonderful finality about a meal; it removes a world of doubts, for no one\n      misses meals except for reasons beyond control. He played many games with\n      Holly on the lawn, pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be\n      ready to bowl to Jolly in the holidays. For she was not a Forsyte, but\n      Jolly was -- and Forsytes always bat, until they have resigned and\n      reached the age of eighty-five. The dog Balthasar, in attendance, lay on\n      the ball as often as he could, and the page-boy fielded, till his face was\n      like the harvest moon. And because the time was getting shorter, each day\n      was longer and more golden than the last. On Friday night he took a liver\n      pill, his side hurt him rather, and though it was not the liver side,\n      there is no remedy like that. Anyone telling him that he had found a new\n      excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him, would have\n      been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deep-set\n      iron-grey eyes, which seemed to say: 'I know my own business best.' He\n      always had and always would.",
                "On Sunday morning, when Holly had gone with her governess to church, he\n      visited the strawberry beds. There, accompanied by the dog Balthasar, he\n      examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen\n      berries which were really ripe. Stooping was not good for him, and he\n      became very dizzy and red in the forehead. Having placed the strawberries\n      in a dish on the dining-table, he washed his hands and bathed his forehead\n      with eau de Cologne. There, before the mirror, it occurred to him that he\n      was thinner. What a 'threadpaper' he had been when he was young! It was\n      nice to be slim -- he could not bear a fat chap; and yet perhaps his\n      cheeks were too thin! She was to arrive by train at half-past twelve and\n      walk up, entering from the road past Drage's farm at the far end of the\n      coppice. And, having looked into June's room to see that there was hot\n      water ready, he set forth to meet her, leisurely, for his heart was\n      beating. The air smelled sweet, larks sang, and the Grand Stand at Epsom\n      was visible. A perfect day! On just such a one, no doubt, six years ago,\n      Soames had brought young Bosinney down with him to look at the site before\n      they began to build. It was Bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for\n      the house -- as June had often told him. In these days he was thinking\n      much about that young fellow, as if his spirit were really haunting the\n      field of his last work, on the chance of seeing -- her. Bosinney -- the\n      one man who had possessed her heart, to whom she had given her whole self\n      with rapture! At his age one could not, of course, imagine such things,\n      but there stirred in him a queer vague aching -- as it were the ghost\n      of an impersonal jealousy; and a feeling, too, more generous, of pity for\n      that love so early lost. All over in a few poor months! Well, well! He\n      looked at his watch before entering the coppice -- only a quarter past,\n      twenty-five minutes to wait! And then, turning the corner of the path, he\n      saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time, on the log; and\n      realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone\n      for a couple of hours at least. Two hours of her society missed! What\n      memory could make that log so dear to her? His face showed what he was\n      thinking, for she said at once:",
                "\"Forgive me, Uncle Jolyon; it was here that I first knew.\"",
                "\"Yes, yes; there it is for you whenever you like. You're looking a little\n      Londony; you're giving too many lessons.\"",
                "That she should have to give lessons worried him. Lessons to a parcel of\n      young girls thumping out scales with their thick fingers.",
                "\"Where do you go to give them?\" he asked.",
                "\"They're mostly Jewish families, luckily.\"",
                "Old Jolyon stared; to all Forsytes Jews seem strange and doubtful.",
                "\"They love music, and they're very kind.\"",
                "\"They had better be, by George!\" He took her arm -- his side always\n      hurt him a little going uphill -- and said:",
                "\"Did you ever see anything like those buttercups? They came like that in a\n      night.\"",
                "Her eyes seemed really to fly over the field, like bees after the flowers\n      and the honey. \"I wanted you to see them -- wouldn't let them turn the\n      cows in yet.\" Then, remembering that she had come to talk about Bosinney,\n      he pointed to the clock-tower over the stables:",
                "\"I expect he wouldn't have let me put that there -- had no notion of\n      time, if I remember.\"",
                "But, pressing his arm to her, she talked of flowers instead, and he knew\n      it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover.",
                "\"The best flower I can show you,\" he said, with a sort of triumph, \"is my\n      little sweet. She'll be back from Church directly. There's something about\n      her which reminds me a little of you,\" and it did not seem to him peculiar\n      that he had put it thus, instead of saying: \"There's something about you\n      which reminds me a little of her.\" Ah! And here she was!",
                "Holly, followed closely by her elderly French governess, whose digestion\n      had been ruined twenty-two years ago in the siege of Strasbourg, came\n      rushing towards them from under the oak tree. She stopped about a dozen\n      yards away, to pat Balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her\n      mind. Old Jolyon, who knew better, said:",
                "\"Well, my darling, here's the lady in grey I promised you.\"",
                "Holly raised herself and looked up. He watched the two of them with a\n      twinkle, Irene smiling, Holly beginning with grave inquiry, passing into a\n      shy smile too, and then to something deeper. She had a sense of beauty,\n      that child -- knew what was what! He enjoyed the sight of the kiss\n      between them.",
                "\"Mrs. Heron, Mam'zelle Beauce. Well, Mam'zelle -- good sermon?\"",
                "For, now that he had not much more time before him, the only part of the\n      service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church\n      remained to him. Mam'zelle Beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad in a\n      black kid glove -- she had been in the best families -- and the\n      rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask: \"Are you\n      well-brrred?\" Whenever Holly or Jolly did anything unpleasing to her -- a\n      not uncommon occurrence -- she would say to them: \"The little Tayleurs\n      never did that -- they were such well-brrred little children.\" Jolly\n      hated the little Tayleurs; Holly wondered dreadfully how it was she fell\n      so short of them. 'A thin rum little soul,' old Jolyon thought her -- Mam'zelle\n      Beauce.",
                "Luncheon was a successful meal, the mushrooms which he himself had picked\n      in the mushroom house, his chosen strawberries, and another bottle of the\n      Steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality, and a\n      conviction that he would have a touch of eczema to-morrow.",
                "After lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking Turkish coffee. It was no\n      matter of grief to him when Mademoiselle Beauce withdrew to write her\n      Sunday letter to her sister, whose future had been endangered in the past\n      by swallowing a pin -- an event held up daily in warning to the\n      children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten. At the foot of the\n      bank, on a carriage rug, Holly and the dog Balthasar teased and loved each\n      other, and in the shade old Jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar\n      luxuriously savoured, gazed at Irene sitting in the swing. A light,\n      vaguely swaying, grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon\n      it, lips just opened, eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped. She\n      looked content; surely it did her good to come and see him! The\n      selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him, for he could still\n      feel pleasure in the pleasure of others, realising that what he wanted,\n      though much, was not quite all that mattered.",
                "\"It's quiet here,\" he said; \"you mustn't come down if you find it dull.\n      But it's a pleasure to see you. My little sweet is the only face which\n      gives me any pleasure, except yours.\"",
                "From her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated,\n      and this reassured him. \"That's not humbug,\" he said. \"I never told a\n      woman I admired her when I didn't. In fact I don't know when I've told a\n      woman I admired her, except my wife in the old days; and wives are funny.\"\n       He was silent, but resumed abruptly:",
                "\"She used to expect me to say it more often than I felt it, and there we\n      were.\" Her face looked mysteriously troubled, and, afraid that he had said\n      something painful, he hurried on: \"When my little sweet marries, I hope\n      she'll find someone who knows what women feel. I shan't be here to see it,\n      but there's too much topsy-turvydom in marriage; I don't want her to pitch\n      up against that.\" And, aware that he had made bad worse, he added: \"That\n      dog will scratch.\"",
                "A silence followed. Of what was she thinking, this pretty creature whose\n      life was spoiled; who had done with love, and yet was made for love? Some\n      day when he was gone, perhaps, she would find another mate -- not so\n      disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over. Ah! but her\n      husband?",
                "\"Does Soames never trouble you?\" he asked.",
                "She shook her head. Her face had closed up suddenly. For all her softness\n      there was something irreconcilable about her. And a glimpse of light on\n      the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which,\n      belonging to early Victorian civilisation -- so much older than this of\n      his old age -- had never thought about such primitive things.",
                "\"That's a comfort,\" he said. \"You can see the Grand Stand to-day. Shall we\n      take a turn round?\"",
                "Through the flower and fruit garden, against whose high outer walls peach\n      trees and nectarines were trained to the sun, through the stables, the\n      vinery, the mushroom house, the asparagus beds, the rosery, the\n      summer-house, he conducted her -- even into the kitchen garden to see\n      the tiny green peas which Holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her\n      finger, and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand. Many\n      delightful things he showed her, while Holly and the dog Balthasar danced\n      ahead, or came to them at intervals for attention. It was one of the\n      happiest afternoons he had ever spent, but it tired him and he was glad to\n      sit down in the music room and let her give him tea. A special little\n      friend of Holly's had come in -- a fair child with short hair like a\n      boy's. And the two sported in the distance, under the stairs, on the\n      stairs, and up in the gallery. Old Jolyon begged for Chopin. She played\n      studies, mazurkas, waltzes, till the two children, creeping near, stood at\n      the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward, listening.\n      Old Jolyon watched.",
                "\"Let's see you dance, you two!\"",
                "Shyly, with a false start, they began. Bobbing and circling, earnest, not\n      very adroit, they went past and past his chair to the strains of that\n      waltz. He watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling\n      towards those little dancers thinking:",
                "'Sweetest picture I've seen for ages.'",
                "A voice said:",
                "\"Hollee! Mais enfin -- qu'est-ce que tu fais la -- danser, le\n      dimanche! Viens, donc!\"",
                "But the children came close to old Jolyon, knowing that he would save\n      them, and gazed into a face which was decidedly 'caught out.'",
                "\"Better the day, better the deed, Mam'zelle. It's all my doing. Trot\n      along, chicks, and have your tea.\"",
                "And, when they were gone, followed by the dog Balthasar, who took every\n      meal, he looked at Irene with a twinkle and said:",
                "\"Well, there we are! Aren't they sweet? Have you any little ones among\n      your pupils?\"",
                "\"Yes, three -- two of them darlings.\"",
                "\"Pretty?\"",
                "\"Lovely!\"",
                "Old Jolyon sighed; he had an insatiable appetite for the very young. \"My\n      little sweet,\" he said, \"is devoted to music; she'll be a musician some\n      day. You wouldn't give me your opinion of her playing, I suppose?\"",
                "\"Of course I will.\"",
                "\"You wouldn't like -- \" but he stifled the words \"to give her lessons.\"\n       The idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him; yet it would mean\n      that he would see her regularly. She left the piano and came over to his\n      chair.",
                "\"I would like, very much; but there is -- June. When are they coming\n      back?\"",
                "Old Jolyon frowned. \"Not till the middle of next month. What does that\n      matter?\"",
                "\"You said June had forgiven me; but she could never forget, Uncle Jolyon.\"",
                "Forget! She must forget, if he wanted her to.",
                "But as if answering, Irene shook her head. \"You know she couldn't; one\n      doesn't forget.\"",
                "Always that wretched past! And he said with a sort of vexed finality:",
                "\"Well, we shall see.\"",
                "He talked to her an hour or more, of the children, and a hundred little\n      things, till the carriage came round to take her home. And when she had\n      gone he went back to his chair, and sat there smoothing his face and chin,\n      dreaming over the day.",
                "That evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper.\n      He stayed for some minutes without writing, then rose and stood under the\n      masterpiece 'Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.' He was not thinking of that\n      picture, but of his life. He was going to leave her something in his Will;\n      nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory. He\n      was going to leave her a portion of his wealth, of his aspirations, deeds,\n      qualities, work -- all that had made that wealth; going to leave her,\n      too, a part of all he had missed in life, by his sane and steady pursuit\n      of wealth. All! What had he missed? 'Dutch Fishing Boats' responded\n      blankly; he crossed to the French window, and drawing the curtain aside,\n      opened it. A wind had got up, and one of last year's oak leaves which had\n      somehow survived the gardener's brooms, was dragging itself with a tiny\n      clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight. Except for that\n      it was very quiet out there, and he could smell the heliotrope watered not\n      long since. A bat went by. A bird uttered its last 'cheep.' And right\n      above the oak tree the first star shone. Faust in the opera had bartered\n      his soul for some fresh years of youth. Morbid notion! No such bargain was\n      possible, that was real tragedy! No making oneself new again for love or\n      life or anything. Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while\n      you could, and leave it something in your Will. But how much? And, as if\n      he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of\n      the country night, he turned back and went up to the chimney-piece. There\n      were his pet bronzes -- a Cleopatra with the asp at her breast; a\n      Socrates; a greyhound playing with her puppy; a strong man reining in some\n      horses. 'They last!' he thought, and a pang went through his heart. They\n      had a thousand years of life before them!",
                "'How much?' Well! enough at all events to save her getting old before her\n      time, to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible, and grey from\n      soiling that bright hair. He might live another five years. She would be\n      well over thirty by then. 'How much?' She had none of his blood in her! In\n      loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty years and more, ever since he\n      married and founded that mysterious thing, a family, came this warning\n      thought -- None of his blood, no right to anything! It was a luxury\n      then, this notion. An extravagance, a petting of an old man's whim, one of\n      those things done in dotage. His real future was vested in those who had\n      his blood, in whom he would live on when he was gone. He turned away from\n      the bronzes and stood looking at the old leather chair in which he had sat\n      and smoked so many hundreds of cigars. And suddenly he seemed to see her\n      sitting there in her grey dress, fragrant, soft, dark-eyed, graceful,\n      looking up at him. Why! She cared nothing for him, really; all she cared\n      for was that lost lover of hers. But she was there, whether she would or\n      no, giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace. One had no right to\n      inflict an old man's company, no right to ask her down to play to him and\n      let him look at her -- for no reward! Pleasure must be paid for in this\n      world. 'How much?' After all, there was plenty; his son and his three\n      grandchildren would never miss that little lump. He had made it himself,\n      nearly every penny; he could leave it where he liked, allow himself this\n      little pleasure. He went back to the bureau. 'Well, I'm going to,' he\n      thought, 'let them think what they like. I'm going to!' And he sat down.",
                "'How much?' Ten thousand, twenty thousand -- how much? If only with his\n      money he could buy one year, one month of youth. And startled by that\n      thought, he wrote quickly:",
                "'DEAR HERRING, -- Draw me a codicil to this effect: \"I leave to my\n      niece Irene Forsyte, born Irene Heron, by which name she now goes, fifteen\n      thousand pounds free of legacy duty.\" 'Yours faithfully, 'JOLYON FORSYTE.'",
                "When he had sealed and stamped the envelope, he went back to the window\n      and drew in a long breath. It was dark, but many stars shone now.",
                "IV",
                "He woke at half-past two, an hour which long experience had taught him\n      brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts. Experience had also taught\n      him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of\n      such panic. On this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid\n      momentum was that if he became ill, at his age not improbable, he would\n      not see her. From this it was but a step to realisation that he would be\n      cut off, too, when his son and June returned from Spain. How could he\n      justify desire for the company of one who had stolen -- early morning\n      does not mince words -- June's lover? That lover was dead; but June was\n      a stubborn little thing; warm-hearted, but stubborn as wood, and -- quite\n      true -- not one who forgot! By the middle of next month they would be\n      back. He had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had\n      come into what remained of his life. Darkness showed up to him absurdly\n      clear the nature of his feeling. Admiration for beauty -- a craving to\n      see that which delighted his eyes.",
                "Preposterous, at his age! And yet -- what other reason was there for\n      asking June to undergo such painful reminder, and how prevent his son and\n      his son's wife from thinking him very queer? He would be reduced to\n      sneaking up to London, which tired him; and the least indisposition would\n      cut him off even from that. He lay with eyes open, setting his jaw against\n      the prospect, and calling himself an old fool, while his heart beat\n      loudly, and then seemed to stop beating altogether. He had seen the dawn\n      lighting the window chinks, heard the birds chirp and twitter, and the\n      cocks crow, before he fell asleep again, and awoke tired but sane. Five\n      weeks before he need bother, at his age an eternity! But that early\n      morning panic had left its mark, had slightly fevered the will of one who\n      had always had his own way. He would see her as often as he wished! Why\n      not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitor's instead of\n      writing about it; she might like to go to the opera! But, by train, for he\n      would not have that fat chap Beacon grinning behind his back. Servants\n      were such fools; and, as likely as not, they had known all the past\n      history of Irene and young Bosinney -- servants knew everything, and\n      suspected the rest. He wrote to her that morning:",
                "\"MY DEAR IRENE, -- I have to be up in town to-morrow. If you would like\n      to have a look in at the opera, come and dine with me quietly ....\"",

                "She would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure;\n      for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was\n      instinctively unpleasant to him; it was not seemly that one so old should\n      go out of his way to see beauty, especially in a woman.",
                "The journey next day, short though it was, and the visit to his lawyer's,\n      tired him. It was hot too, and after dressing for dinner he lay down on\n      the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little. He must have had a sort of\n      fainting fit, for he came to himself feeling very queer; and with some\n      difficulty rose and rang the bell. Why! it was past seven! And there he\n      was and she would be waiting. But suddenly the dizziness came on again,\n      and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa. He heard the maid's voice say:",

                "When she was gone, he thought feebly: 'Why did I say a lady in grey -- she\n      may be in anything. Sal volatile!' He did not go off again, yet was not\n      conscious of how Irene came to be standing beside him, holding smelling\n      salts to his nose, and pushing a pillow up behind his head. He heard her\n      say anxiously: \"Dear Uncle Jolyon, what is it?\" was dimly conscious of the\n      soft pressure of her lips on his hand; then drew a long breath of smelling\n      salts, suddenly discovered strength in them, and sneezed.",
                "\"Ha!\" he said, \"it's nothing. How did you get here? Go down and dine -- the\n      tickets are on the dressing-table. I shall be all right in a minute.\"",
                "He felt her cool hand on his forehead, smelled violets, and sat divided\n      between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right.",
                "\"Why! You are in grey!\" he said. \"Help me up.\" Once on his feet he gave\n      himself a shake.",

                "\"I should have liked you for a daughter,\" he said suddenly; and watching\n      the smile in her eyes, went on:",
                "\"You mustn't get wrapped up in the past at your time of life; plenty of\n      that when you get to my age. That's a nice dress -- I like the style.\"",
                "\"I made it myself.\"",
                "Ah! A woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her\n      interest in life.",
                "\"Make hay while the sun shines,\" he said; \"and drink that up. I want to\n      see some colour in your cheeks. We mustn't waste life; it doesn't do.\n      There's a new Marguerite to-night; let's hope she won't be fat. And\n      Mephisto -- anything more dreadful than a fat chap playing the Devil I\n      can't imagine.\"",
                "But they did not go to the opera after all, for in getting up from dinner\n      the dizziness came over him again, and she insisted on his staying quiet\n      and going to bed early. When he parted from her at the door of the hotel,\n      having paid the cabman to drive her to Chelsea, he sat down again for a\n      moment to enjoy the memory of her words: \"You are such a darling to me,\n      Uncle Jolyon!\" Why! Who wouldn't be! He would have liked to stay up\n      another day and take her to the Zoo, but two days running of him would\n      bore her to death. No, he must wait till next Sunday; she had promised to\n      come then. They would settle those lessons for Holly, if only for a month.\n      It would be something. That little Mam'zelle Beauce wouldn't like it, but\n      she would have to lump it. And crushing his old opera hat against his\n      chest he sought the lift.",
                "He drove to Waterloo next morning, struggling with a desire to say: 'Drive\n      me to Chelsea.' But his sense of proportion was too strong. Besides, he\n      still felt shaky, and did not want to risk another aberration like that of\n      last night, away from home. Holly, too, was expecting him, and what he had\n      in his bag for her. Not that there was any cupboard love in his little\n      sweet -- she was a bundle of affection. Then, with the rather bitter\n      cynicism of the old, he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard\n      love which made Irene put up with him. No, she was not that sort either.\n      She had, if anything, too little notion of how to butter her bread, no\n      sense of property, poor thing! Besides, he had not breathed a word about\n      that codicil, nor should he -- sufficient unto the day was the good\n      thereof.",
                "In the victoria which met him at the station Holly was restraining the dog\n      Balthasar, and their caresses made 'jubey' his drive home. All the rest of\n      that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and peaceful,\n      reposing in the shade, while the long lingering sunshine showered gold on\n      the lawns and the flowers. But on Thursday evening at his lonely dinner he\n      began to count the hours; sixty-five till he would go down to meet her\n      again in the little coppice, and walk up through the fields at her side.\n      He had intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit, but the\n      fellow would be sure to insist on quiet, no excitement and all that; and\n      he did not mean to be tied by the leg, did not want to be told of an\n      infirmity -- if there were one, could not afford to hear of it at his\n      time of life, now that this new interest had come. And he carefully\n      avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his son. It would only\n      bring them back with a run! How far this silence was due to consideration\n      for their pleasure, how far to regard for his own, he did not pause to\n      consider.",
                "That night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off,\n      when he heard the rustle of a gown, and was conscious of a scent of\n      violets. Opening his eyes he saw her, dressed in grey, standing by the\n      fireplace, holding out her arms. The odd thing was that, though those arms\n      seemed to hold nothing, they were curved as if round someone's neck, and\n      her own neck was bent back, her lips open, her eyes closed. She vanished\n      at once, and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes. But those bronzes\n      and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was, only the fireplace\n      and the wall! Shaken and troubled, he got up. 'I must take medicine,' he\n      thought; 'I can't be well.' His heart beat too fast, he had an asthmatic\n      feeling in the chest; and going to the window, he opened it to get some\n      air. A dog was barking far away, one of the dogs at Gage's farm no doubt,\n      beyond the coppice. A beautiful still night, but dark. 'I dropped off,' he\n      mused, 'that's it! And yet I'll swear my eyes were open!' A sound like a\n      sigh seemed to answer.",
                "\"What's that?\" he said sharply, \"who's there?\"",
                "Putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart, he stepped\n      out on the terrace. Something soft scurried by in the dark. \"Shoo!\" It was\n      that great grey cat. 'Young Bosinney was like a great cat!' he thought.\n      'It was him in there, that she -- that she was -- He's got her\n      still!' He walked to the edge of the terrace, and looked down into the\n      darkness; he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown\n      lawn. Here to-day and gone to-morrow! And there came the moon, who saw\n      all, young and old, alive and dead, and didn't care a dump! His own turn\n      soon. For a single day of youth he would give what was left! And he turned\n      again towards the house. He could see the windows of the night nursery up\n      there. His little sweet would be asleep. 'Hope that dog won't wake her!'\n      he thought. 'What is it makes us love, and makes us die! I must go to\n      bed.'",
                "And across the terrace stones, growing grey in the moonlight, he passed\n      back within.",
                "How should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his well-spent\n      past? In that, at all events, there is no agitating warmth, only pale\n      winter sunshine. The shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos\n      of memory. The present he should distrust; the future shun. From beneath\n      thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes. If there be\n      sun of summer, let him not go out into it, mistaking it for the\n      Indian-summer sun! Thus peradventure he shall decline softly, slowly,\n      imperceptibly, until impatient Nature clutches his wind-pipe and he gasps\n      away to death some early morning before the world is aired, and they put\n      on his tombstone: 'In the fulness of years!' yea! If he preserve his\n      principles in perfect order, a Forsyte may live on long after he is dead.",
                "Old Jolyon was conscious of all this, and yet there was in him that which\n      transcended Forsyteism. For it is written that a Forsyte shall not love\n      beauty more than reason; nor his own way more than his own health. And\n      something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at\n      the thinning shell. His sagacity knew this, but it knew too that he could\n      not stop that beating, nor would if he could. And yet, if you had told him\n      he was living on his capital, he would have stared you down. No, no; a man\n      did not live on his capital; it was not done! The shibboleths of the past\n      are ever more real than the actualities of the present. And he, to whom\n      living on one's capital had always been anathema, could not have borne to\n      have applied so gross a phrase to his own case. Pleasure is healthful;\n      beauty good to see; to live again in the youth of the young -- and what\n      else on earth was he doing!",
                "Methodically, as had been the way of his whole life, he now arranged his\n      time. On Tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train; Irene came and dined\n      with him. And they went to the opera. On Thursdays he drove to town, and,\n      putting that fat chap and his horses up, met her in Kensington Gardens,\n      picking up the carriage after he had left her, and driving home again in\n      time for dinner. He threw out the casual formula that he had business in\n      London on those two days. On Wednesdays and Saturdays she came down to\n      give Holly music lessons. The greater the pleasure he took in her society,\n      the more scrupulously fastidious he became, just a matter-of-fact and\n      friendly uncle. Not even in feeling, really, was he more -- for, after\n      all, there was his age. And yet, if she were late he fidgeted himself to\n      death. If she missed coming, which happened twice, his eyes grew sad as an\n      old dog's, and he failed to sleep.",
                "And so a month went by -- a month of summer in the fields, and in his\n      heart, with summer's heat and the fatigue thereof. Who could have believed\n      a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his son's and his\n      grand-daughter's return with something like dread! There was such a\n      delicious freedom, such recovery of that independence a man enjoys before\n      he founds a family, about these weeks of lovely weather, and this new\n      companionship with one who demanded nothing, and remained always a little\n      unknown, retaining the fascination of mystery. It was like a draught of\n      wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost\n      forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood, the narcotic to his brain.\n      The flowers were coloured brighter, scents and music and the sunlight had\n      a living value -- were no longer mere reminders of past enjoyment.\n      There was something now to live for which stirred him continually to\n      anticipation. He lived in that, not in retrospection; the difference is\n      considerable to any so old as he. The pleasures of the table, never of\n      much consequence to one naturally abstemious, had lost all value. He ate\n      little, without knowing what he ate; and every day grew thinner and more\n      worn to look at. He was again a 'threadpaper'. and to this thinned form\n      his massive forehead, with hollows at the temples, gave more dignity than\n      ever. He was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor, but liberty\n      was too sweet. He could not afford to pet his frequent shortness of breath\n      and the pain in his side at the expense of liberty. Return to the\n      vegetable existence he had led among the agricultural journals with the\n      life-size mangold wurzels, before this new attraction came into his life -- no!\n      He exceeded his allowance of cigars. Two a day had always been his rule.\n      Now he smoked three and sometimes four -- a man will when he is filled\n      with the creative spirit. But very often he thought: 'I must give up\n      smoking, and coffee; I must give up rattling up to town.' But he did not;\n      there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him, and this was a\n      priceless boon.",
                "The servants perhaps wondered, but they were, naturally, dumb. Mam'zelle\n      Beauce was too concerned with her own digestion, and too 'wellbrrred' to\n      make personal allusions. Holly had not as yet an eye for the relative\n      appearance of him who was her plaything and her god. It was left for Irene\n      herself to beg him to eat more, to rest in the hot part of the day, to\n      take a tonic, and so forth. But she did not tell him that she was the a\n      cause of his thinness -- for one cannot see the havoc oneself is\n      working. A man of eighty-five has no passions, but the Beauty which\n      produces passion works on in the old way, till death closes the eyes which\n      crave the sight of Her.",
                "On the first day of the second week in July he received a letter from his\n      son in Paris to say that they would all be back on Friday. This had always\n      been more sure than Fate; but, with the pathetic improvidence given to the\n      old, that they may endure to the end, he had never quite admitted it. Now\n      he did, and something would have to be done. He had ceased to be able to\n      imagine life without this new interest, but that which is not imagined\n      sometimes exists, as Forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost. He\n      sat in his old leather chair, doubling up the letter, and mumbling with\n      his lips the end of an unlighted cigar. After to-morrow his Tuesday\n      expeditions to town would have to be abandoned. He could still drive up,\n      perhaps, once a week, on the pretext of seeing his man of business. But\n      even that would be dependent on his health, for now they would begin to\n      fuss about him. The lessons! The lessons must go on! She must swallow down\n      her scruples, and June must put her feelings in her pocket. She had done\n      so once, on the day after the news of Bosinney's death; what she had done\n      then, she could surely do again now. Four years since that injury was\n      inflicted on her -- not Christian to keep the memory of old sores\n      alive. June's will was strong, but his was stronger, for his sands were\n      running out. Irene was soft, surely she would do this for him, subdue her\n      natural shrinking, sooner than give him pain! The lessons must continue;\n      for if they did, he was secure. And lighting his cigar at last, he began\n      trying to shape out how to put it to them all, and explain this strange\n      intimacy; how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truth -- that he\n      could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty. Ah! Holly! Holly was\n      fond of her, Holly liked her lessons. She would save him -- his little\n      sweet! And with that happy thought he became serene, and wondered what he\n      had been worrying about so fearfully. He must not worry, it left him\n      always curiously weak, and as if but half present in his own body.",
                "That evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness, though he did\n      not faint. He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a\n      fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous. When one grew\n      old, the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom, and for what\n      reason? -- just to keep the breath in him a little longer. He did not\n      want it at such cost. Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from\n      that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink\n      some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon felt\n      able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still shaky next\n      morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him. It was\n      always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner -- he suspected her of\n      undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow\n      and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn't much\n      pleasure, and this was the last time he would be able to give her that\n      treat. But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he\n      had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion,\n      too, of telling her about June's return.",
                "The opera that evening was 'Carmen,' and he chose the last entr'acte to\n      break the news, instinctively putting it off till the latest moment.",
                "She took it quietly, queerly; in fact, he did not know how she had taken\n      it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary.\n      The mask was down over her face, that mask behind which so much went on\n      that he could not see. She wanted time to think it over, no doubt! He\n      would not press her, for she would be coming to give her lesson to-morrow\n      afternoon, and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea.\n      In the cab he talked only of the Carmen; he had seen better in the old\n      days, but this one was not bad at all. When he took her hand to say\n      good-night, she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead.",
                "\"Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon, you have been so sweet to me.\"",
                "\"To-morrow then,\" he said. \"Good-night. Sleep well.\" She echoed softly:\n      \"Sleep well\" and from the cab window, already moving away, he saw her face\n      screwed round towards him, and her hand put out in a gesture which seemed\n      to linger.",
                "He sought his room slowly. They never gave him the same, and he could not\n      get used to these 'spick-and-spandy' bedrooms with new furniture and\n      grey-green carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses. He was wakeful and\n      that wretched Habanera kept throbbing in his head.",
                "His French had never been equal to its words, but its sense he knew, if it\n      had any sense, a gipsy thing -- wild and unaccountable. Well, there was\n      in life something which upset all your care and plans -- something\n      which made men and women dance to its pipes. And he lay staring from\n      deep-sunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway. You\n      thought you had hold of life, but it slipped away behind you, took you by\n      the scruff of the neck, forced you here and forced you there, and then,\n      likely as not, squeezed life out of you! It took the very stars like that,\n      he shouldn't wonder, rubbed their noses together and flung them apart; it\n      had never done playing its pranks. Five million people in this great\n      blunderbuss of a town, and all of them at the mercy of that Life-Force,\n      like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when you struck\n      your fist on it. Ah, well! Himself would not hop much longer -- a good\n      long sleep would do him good!",
                "How hot it was up here! -- how noisy! His forehead burned; she had\n      kissed it just where he always worried; just there -- as if she had\n      known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him. But, instead,\n      her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness. She had never spoken in\n      quite that voice, had never before made that lingering gesture or looked\n      back at him as she drove away.",
                "He got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside; his room faced down over\n      the river. There was little air, but the sight of that breadth of water\n      flowing by, calm, eternal, soothed him. 'The great thing,' he thought 'is\n      not to make myself a nuisance. I'll think of my little sweet, and go to\n      sleep.' But it was long before the heat and throbbing of the London night\n      died out into the short slumber of the summer morning. And old Jolyon had\n      but forty winks.",
                "When he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden, and with\n      the help of Holly, who was very delicate with flowers, gathered a great\n      bunch of carnations. They were, he told her, for 'the lady in grey' -- a\n      name still bandied between them; and he put them in a bowl in his study\n      where he meant to tackle Irene the moment she came, on the subject of June\n      and future lessons. Their fragrance and colour would help. After lunch he\n      lay down, for he felt very tired, and the carriage would not bring her\n      from the station till four o'clock. But as the hour approached he grew\n      restless, and sought the schoolroom, which overlooked the drive. The\n      sun-blinds were down, and Holly was there with Mademoiselle Beauce,\n      sheltered from the heat of a stifling July day, attending to their\n      silkworms. Old Jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical\n      creatures, whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants; who nibbled\n      such quantities of holes in nice green leaves; and smelled, as he thought,\n      horrid. He sat down on a chintz-covered windowseat whence he could see the\n      drive, and get what air there was; and the dog Balthasar who appreciated\n      chintz on hot days, jumped up beside him. Over the cottage piano a violet\n      dust-sheet, faded almost to grey, was spread, and on it the first\n      lavender, whose scent filled the room. In spite of the coolness here,\n      perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his\n      ebbed-down senses. Each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying\n      brilliance; that dog smelled very strong; the lavender perfume was\n      overpowering; those silkworms heaving up their grey-green backs seemed\n      horribly alive; and Holly's dark head bent over them had a wonderfully\n      silky sheen. A marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old\n      and weak; it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its\n      beating vitality. He had never, till those last few weeks, had this\n      curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the\n      stream of life, and with the other half left on the bank, watching that\n      helpless progress. Only when Irene was with him did he lose this double\n      consciousness.",
                "Holly turned her head, pointed with her little brown fist to the piano -- for\n      to point with a finger was not 'well-brrred' -- and said slyly:",
                "\"Look at the 'lady in grey,' Gran; isn't she pretty to-day?\"",
                "Old Jolyon's heart gave a flutter, and for a second the room was clouded;\n      then it cleared, and he said with a twinkle:",
                "\"Who's been dressing her up?\"",
                "\"Mam'zelle.\"",
                "\"Hollee! Don't be foolish!\"",
                "That prim little Frenchwoman! She hadn't yet got over the music lessons\n      being taken away from her. That wouldn't help. His little sweet was the\n      only friend they had. Well, they were her lessons. And he shouldn't budge\n      shouldn't budge for anything. He stroked the warm wool on Balthasar's\n      head, and heard Holly say: \"When mother's home, there won't be any\n      changes, will there? She doesn't like strangers, you know.\"",
                "The child's words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition\n      about old Jolyon, and disclose all the menace to his new-found freedom.\n      Ah! He would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of\n      care and love, or fight to keep this new and prized companionship; and to\n      fight tired him to death. But his thin, worn face hardened into resolution\n      till it appeared all Jaw. This was his house, and his affair; he should\n      not budge! He looked at his watch, old and thin like himself; he had owned\n      it fifty years. Past four already! And kissing the top of Holly's head in\n      passing, he went down to the hall. He wanted to get hold of her before she\n      went up to give her lesson. At the first sound of wheels he stepped out\n      into the porch, and saw at once that the victoria was empty.",
                "\"The train's in, sir; but the lady 'asn't come.\"",
                "Old Jolyon gave him a sharp upward look, his eyes seemed to push away that\n      fat chap's curiosity, and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was\n      feeling.",
                "\"Very well,\" he said, and turned back into the house. He went to his study\n      and sat down, quivering like a leaf. What did this mean? She might have\n      lost her train, but he knew well enough she hadn't. 'Good-bye, dear Uncle\n      Jolyon.' Why 'Good-bye' and not 'Good-night'. And that hand of hers\n      lingering in the air. And her kiss. What did it mean? Vehement alarm and\n      irritation took possession of him. He got up and began to pace the Turkey\n      carpet, between window and wall. She was going to give him up! He felt it\n      for certain -- and he defenceless. An old man wanting to look on\n      beauty! It was ridiculous! Age closed his mouth, paralysed his power to\n      fight. He had no right to what was warm and living, no right to anything\n      but memories and sorrow. He could not plead with her; even an old man has\n      his dignity. Defenceless! For an hour, lost to bodily fatigue, he paced up\n      and down, past the bowl of carnations he had plucked, which mocked him\n      with its scent. Of all things hard to bear, the prostration of will-power\n      is hardest, for one who has always had his way. Nature had got him in its\n      net, and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes, here and\n      there, found no hole, no breaking point. They brought him tea at five\n      o'clock, and a letter. For a moment hope beat up in him. He cut the\n      envelope with the butter knife, and read:",
                "\"DEAREST UNCLE JOLYON, -- I can't bear to write anything that may\n      disappoint you, but I was too cowardly to tell you last night. I feel I\n      can't come down and give Holly any more lessons, now that June is coming\n      back. Some things go too deep to be forgotten. It has been such a joy to\n      see you and Holly. Perhaps I shall still see you sometimes when you come\n      up, though I'm sure it's not good for you; I can see you are tiring\n      yourself too much. I believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot\n      weather, and now you have your son and June coming back you will be so\n      happy. Thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me.",
                "\"Lovingly your IRENE.\"",
                "So, there it was! Not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly\n      cared about; to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things,\n      the approach of death with its stealthy, rustling footsteps. Not good for\n      him! Not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life,\n      the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him.",
                "His tea grew cold, his cigar remained unlit; and up and down he paced,\n      torn between his dignity and his hold on life. Intolerable to be squeezed\n      out slowly, without a say of your own, to live on when your will was in\n      the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love.\n      Intolerable! He would see what telling her the truth would do -- the\n      truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on. He\n      sat down at his old bureau and took a pen. But he could not write. There\n      was something revolting in having to plead like this; plead that she\n      should warm his eyes with her beauty. It was tantamount to confessing\n      dotage. He simply could not. And instead, he wrote:",
                "\"I had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to stand in\n      the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little\n      grand-daughter. But old men learn to forego their whims; they are obliged\n      to, even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later; and perhaps\n      the sooner the better.",

                "\"JOLYON FORSYTE.\"",
                "'Bitter,' he thought, 'but I can't help it. I'm tired.' He sealed and\n      dropped it into the box for the evening post, and hearing it fall to the\n      bottom, thought: 'There goes all I've looked forward to!'",
                "That evening after dinner which he scarcely touched, after his cigar which\n      he left half-smoked for it made him feel faint, he went very slowly\n      upstairs and stole into the night-nursery. He sat down on the window-seat.\n      A night-light was burning, and he could just see Holly's face, with one\n      hand underneath the cheek. An early cockchafer buzzed in the Japanese\n      paper with which they had filled the grate, and one of the horses in the\n      stable stamped restlessly. To sleep like that child! He pressed apart two\n      rungs of the venetian blind and looked out. The moon was rising,\n      blood-red. He had never seen so red a moon. The woods and fields out there\n      were dropping to sleep too, in the last glimmer of the summer light. And\n      beauty, like a spirit, walked. 'I've had a long life,' he thought, 'the\n      best of nearly everything. I'm an ungrateful chap; I've seen a lot of\n      beauty in my time. Poor young Bosinney said I had a sense of beauty.\n      There's a man in the moon to-night!' A moth went by, another, another.\n      'Ladies in grey!' He closed his eyes. A feeling that he would never open\n      them again beset him; he let it grow, let himself sink; then, with a\n      shiver, dragged the lids up. There was something wrong with him, no doubt,\n      deeply wrong; he would have to have the doctor after all. It didn't much\n      matter now! Into that coppice the moon-light would have crept; there would\n      be shadows, and those shadows would be the only things awake. No birds,\n      beasts, flowers, insects; Just the shadows -- moving; 'Ladies in grey!'\n      Over that log they would climb; would whisper together. She and Bosinney!\n      Funny thought! And the frogs and little things would whisper too! How the\n      clock ticked, in here! It was all eerie -- out there in the light of\n      that red moon; in here with the little steady night-light and, the ticking\n      clock and the nurse's dressing-gown hanging from the edge of the screen,\n      tall, like a woman's figure. 'Lady in grey!' And a very odd thought beset\n      him: Did she exist? Had she ever come at all? Or was she but the emanation\n      of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon? The violet-grey\n      spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair, who walks the dawn\n      and the moonlight, and at blue-bell time? What was she, who was she, did\n      she exist? He rose and stood a moment clutching the window-sill, to give\n      him a sense of reality again; then began tiptoeing towards the door. He\n      stopped at the foot of the bed; and Holly, as if conscious of his eyes\n      fixed on her, stirred, sighed, and curled up closer in defence. He tiptoed\n      on and passed out into the dark passage; reached his room, undressed at\n      once, and stood before a mirror in his night-shirt. What a scarecrow -- with\n      temples fallen in, and thin legs! His eyes resisted his own image, and a\n      look of pride came on his face. All was in league to pull him down, even\n      his reflection in the glass, but he was not down -- yet! He got into\n      bed, and lay a long time without sleeping, trying to reach resignation,\n      only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for\n      him.",
                "He woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for\n      the doctor. After sounding him, the fellow pulled a face as long as your\n      arm, and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking. That was no\n      hardship; there was nothing to get up for, and when he felt ill, tobacco\n      always lost its savour. He spent the morning languidly with the sun-blinds\n      down, turning and re-turning The Times, not reading much, the dog\n      Balthasar lying beside his bed. With his lunch they brought him a\n      telegram, running thus:",
                "'Your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at\n      four-thirty. Irene.'",
                "Coming down! After all! Then she did exist -- and he was not deserted.\n      Coming down! A glow ran through his limbs; his cheeks and forehead felt\n      hot. He drank his soup, and pushed the tray-table away, lying very quiet\n      until they had removed lunch and left him alone; but every now and then\n      his eyes twinkled. Coming down! His heart beat fast, and then did not seem\n      to beat at all. At three o'clock he got up and dressed deliberately,\n      noiselessly. Holly and Mam'zelle would be in the schoolroom, and the\n      servants asleep after their dinner, he shouldn't wonder. He opened his\n      door cautiously, and went downstairs. In the hall the dog Balthasar lay\n      solitary, and, followed by him, old Jolyon passed into his study and out\n      into the burning afternoon. He meant to go down and meet her in the\n      coppice, but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat. He sat\n      down instead under the oak tree by the swing, and the dog Balthasar, who\n      also felt the heat, lay down beside him. He sat there smiling. What a\n      revel of bright minutes! What a hum of insects, and cooing of pigeons! It\n      was the quintessence of a summer day. Lovely! And he was happy -- happy\n      as a sand-boy, whatever that might be. She was coming; she had not given\n      him up! He had everything in life he wanted -- except a little more\n      breath, and less weight -- just here! He would see her when she emerged\n      from the fernery, come swaying just a little, a violet-grey figure passing\n      over the daisies and dandelions and 'soldiers' on the lawn -- the\n      soldiers with their flowery crowns. He would not move, but she would come\n      up to him and say: 'Dear Uncle Jolyon, I am sorry!' and sit in the swing\n      and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but\n      was all right now; and that dog would lick her hand. That dog knew his\n      master was fond of her; that dog was a good dog.",
                "It was quite shady under the tree; the sun could not get at him, only make\n      the rest of the world bright so that he could see the Grand Stand at Epsom\n      away out there, very far, and the cows cropping the clover in the field\n      and swishing at the flies with their tails. He smelled the scent of limes,\n      and lavender. Ah! that was why there was such a racket of bees. They were\n      excited -- busy, as his heart was busy and excited. Drowsy, too, drowsy\n      and drugged on honey and happiness; as his heart was drugged and drowsy.\n      Summer -- summer -- they seemed saying; great bees and little bees,\n      and the flies too!",
                "The stable clock struck four; in half an hour she would be here. He would\n      have just one tiny nap, because he had had so little sleep of late; and\n      then he would be fresh for her, fresh for youth and beauty, coming towards\n      him across the sunlit lawn -- lady in grey! And settling back in his\n      chair he closed his eyes. Some thistle-down came on what little air there\n      was, and pitched on his moustache more white than itself. He did not know;\n      but his breathing stirred it, caught there. A ray of sunlight struck\n      through and lodged on his boot. A bumble-bee alighted and strolled on the\n      crown of his Panama hat. And the delicious surge of slumber reached the\n      brain beneath that hat, and the head swayed forward and rested on his\n      breast. Summer -- summer! So went the hum.",
                "The stable clock struck the quarter past. The dog Balthasar stretched and\n      looked up at his master. The thistledown no longer moved. The dog placed\n      his chin over the sunlit foot. It did not stir. The dog withdrew his chin\n      quickly, rose, and leaped on old Jolyon's lap, looked in his face, whined;\n      then, leaping down, sat on his haunches, gazing up. And suddenly he\n      uttered a long, long howl.",
                "But the thistledown was still as death, and the face of his old master.",
                "Summer -- summer -- summer! The soundless footsteps on the grass!",
