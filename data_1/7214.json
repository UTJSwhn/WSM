                "KNUT HAMSUN: FROM HUNGER TO HARVEST",
                "Between \"Hunger\" and \"Growth of the Soil\" lies the time generally allotted\n      to a generation, but at first glance the two books seem much farther\n      apart. One expresses the passionate revolt of a homeless wanderer against\n      the conventional routine of modern life. The other celebrates a root-fast\n      existence bounded in every direction by monotonous chores. The issuance of\n      two such books from the same pen suggests to the superficial view a\n      complete reversal of position. The truth, however, is that Hamsun stands\n      today where he has always stood. His objective is the same. If he has\n      changed, it is only in the intensity of his feeling and the mode of his\n      attack. What, above all, he hates and combats is the artificial\n      uselessness of existence which to him has become embodied in the life of\n      the city as opposed to that of the country.",
                "Problems do not enter into the novels of Hamsun in the same manner as they\n      did into the plays of Ibsen. Hamsun would seem to take life as it is, not\n      with any pretense at its complete acceptability, but without hope or\n      avowed intention of making it over. If his tolerance be never free from\n      satire, his satire is on the other hand always easily tolerant. One might\n      almost suspect him of viewing life as something static against which all\n      fight would be futile. Even life's worst brutalities are related with an\n      offhandedness of manner that makes you look for the joke that must be at\n      the bottom of them. The word reform would seem to be strangely\n      eliminated from his dictionary, or, if present, it might be found defined\n      as a humorous conception of something intrinsically unachievable.",
                "Hamsun would not be the artist he is if he were less deceptive. He has his\n      problems no less than Ibsen had, and he is much preoccupied with them even\n      when he appears lost in ribald laughter. They are different from Ibsen's,\n      however, and in that difference lies one of the chief explanations of\n      Hamsun's position as an artist. All of Ibsen's problems became in the last\n      instance reducible to a single relationship -- that between the\n      individual and his own self. To be himself was his cry and his task. With\n      this consummation in view, he plumbed every depth of human nature. This\n      one thing achieved, all else became insignificant.",
                "Hamsun begins where Ibsen ended, one might say. The one problem never\n      consciously raised by him as a problem is that of man's duty or ability to\n      express his own nature. That is taken for granted. The figures populating\n      the works of Hamsun, whether centrally placed or moving shadowlike in the\n      periphery, are first of all themselves -- agressively, inevitably,\n      unconsciously so, In other words, they are like their creator. They may\n      perish tragically or ridiculously as a result of their common inability to\n      lay violent hand on their own natures. They may go through life warped and\n      dwarfed for lack of an adjustment that to most of us might seem both easy\n      and natural. Their own selves may become more clearly revealed to them by\n      harsh or happy contacts with life, and they may change their surfaces\n      accordingly. The one thing never occurring to them is that they might, for\n      the sake of something or some one outside of themselves, be anything but\n      what they are.",
                "There are interferences, however, and it is from these that Hamsun's\n      problems spring. A man may prosper or suffer by being himself, and in\n      neither case is the fault his own. There are factors that more or less\n      fatally influence and circumscribe the supremely important factor that is\n      his own self. Roughly these fall into three groups suggestive of three\n      classes of relationships: (1) between man and his general environment; (2)\n      between man and that ever-present force of life which we call love; and\n      (3) between man and life in its entirety, as an omnipotence that some of\n      us call God and others leave unnamed. Hamsun's deceptive preference for\n      indirectness is shown by the fact that, while he tries to make us believe\n      that his work is chiefly preoccupied with problems of the second class,\n      his mind is really busy with those of the first class. The explanation is\n      simple. Nothing helps like love to bring out the unique qualities of a\n      man's nature. On the other hand, there is nothing that does more to\n      prevent a man from being himself than the ruts of habit into which his\n      environment always tends to drive him. There are two kinds of environment,\n      natural and human. Hamsun appears to think that the less you have of one\n      and the more of the other, the better for yourself and for humanity as a\n      whole. The city to him is primarily concentrated human environment, and as\n      such bad. This phase of his attitude toward life almost amounts to a\n      phobia. It must be connected with personal experiences of unusual depth\n      and intensity. Perhaps it offers a key that may be well worth searching\n      for. Hamsun was born in the country, of and among peasants. In such\n      surroundings he grew up. The removal of his parents from the central\n      inland part of Norway to the rocky northern coast meant a change of\n      natural setting, but not a human contact. The sea must have come into his\n      life as a revelation, and yet it plays an astonishingly small part in his\n      work. It is always present, but always in the distance. You hear of it,\n      but you are never taken to it.",
                "At about fifteen, Hamsun had an experience which is rarely mentioned as\n      part of the scant biographical material made available by his reserve\n      concerning his own personality. He returned to the old home of his parents\n      in the Gudbrand Valley and worked for a few months as clerk in a country\n      store -- a store just like any one of those that figure so\n      conspicuously in almost every one of his novels. The place and the work\n      must have made a revolutionary impression on him. It apparently aroused\n      longings, and it probably laid the basis for resistances and resentments\n      that later blossomed into weedlike abundance as he came in contact with\n      real city life. There runs through his work a strange sense of sympathy\n      for the little store on the border of the wilderness, but it is also\n      stamped as the forerunner and panderer of the lures of the city.",
                "As a boy of eighteen, when working in a tiny coast town as a cobbler's\n      apprentice, he ventured upon his first literary endeavors and actually\n      managed to get two volumes printed at his own cost. The art of writing was\n      in his blood, exercising a call and a command that must have been felt as\n      a pain at times, and as a consecration at other times. Books and writing\n      were connected with the city. Perhaps the hatred that later days\n      developed, had its roots in a thwarted passion. Even in the little\n      community where his first scribblings reached print he must have felt\n      himself in urban surroundings, and perhaps those first crude volumes drew\n      upon him laughter and scorn that his sensitive soul never forgot. If\n      something of the kind happened, the seed thus sown was nourished\n      plentifully afterwards, when, as a young man, Hamsun pitted his ambitions\n      against the indifference first of Christiania and then of Chicago. The\n      result was a defeat that seemed the more bitter because it looked like\n      punishment incurred by straying after false gods.",
                "Others have suffered in the same way, although, being less rigidly\n      themselves, they may not, like Hamsun, have taken a perverse pleasure in\n      driving home the point of the agony. Others have thought and said harsh\n      things of the cities. But no one that I can recall has equalled Hamsun in\n      his merciless denunciation of the very principle of urbanity. The truth of\n      it seems to be that Hamsun's pilgrimage to the bee hives where modern\n      humanity clusters typically, was an essential violation of something\n      within himself that mattered even more than his literary ambition to his\n      soul's integrity. Perhaps, if I am right, he is the first genuine peasant\n      who has risen to such artistic mastery, reaching its ultimate heights\n      through a belated recognition of his own proper settings. Hamsun was sixty\n      when he wrote \"Growth of the Soil.\" It is the first work in which he\n      celebrates the life of the open country for its own sake, and not merely\n      as a contrast to the artificiality and selfishness of the cities. It was\n      written, too, after he had definitely withdrawn himself from the gathering\n      places of the writers and the artists to give an equal share of his time\n      and attention to the tilling of the soil that was at last his own. It is\n      the harvest of his ultimate self-discovery.",
                "The various phases of his campaign against city life are also interesting\n      and illuminating. Early in his career as a writer he tried an open attack\n      in full force by a couple of novels, \"Shallow Soil\" and \"Editor Lynge\",\n      dealing sarcastically with the literary Bohemia of the Norwegian capital.\n      They were, on the whole, failures -- artistically rather than\n      commercially. They are among his poorest books. The attack was never\n      repeated in that form. He retired to the country, so to speak, and tried\n      from there to strike at what he could reach of the ever expanding, ever\n      devouring city. After that the city, like the sea, is always found in the\n      distance. One feels it without ever seeing it. There is fear as well as\n      hatred in his treatment of it.",
                "In the country it is represented not so much by the store, which, after\n      all, fills an unmistakable need on the part of the rural population, as by\n      the representatives of the various professions. For these Hamsun\n      entertains a hostile feeling hardly less marked than that bestowed on\n      their place of origin, whither, to his openly declared disgust, they are\n      always longing. It does not matter whether they are ministers or actors,\n      lawyers or doctors -- they are all tarred with the same brush. Their\n      common characteristic is their rootlessness. They have no real home,\n      because to Hamsun a home is unthinkable apart from a space of soil\n      possessed in continuity by successive generations. They are always\n      despising the surroundings in which they find themselves temporarily, and\n      their chief claim to distinction is a genuine or pretended knowledge of\n      life on a large scale. Greatness is to them inseparably connected with\n      crowdedness, and what they call sophistication is at bottom nothing but a\n      wallowing in that herd instinct which takes the place of mankind's ancient\n      antagonist in Hamsun's books. Above all, their standards of judgment are\n      not their own.",
                "From what has just been said one might conclude that the spirit of Hamsun\n      is fundamentally unsocial. So it is, in a way, but only in so far as we\n      have come to think of social and urban as more or less interchangeable\n      terms. He has a social consciousness and a social passion of his own, but\n      it is decentralized, one might say. He knows of no greater man than his\n      own Isak of \"Growth of the Soil\" -- a simple pioneer in whose wake new\n      homes spring up, an inarticulate and uncouth personification of man's\n      mastery of nature. When Hamsun speaks of Isak passing across the yearning,\n      spring-stirred fields, \"with the grain flung in fructifying waves from his\n      reverent hands,\" he pictures it deliberately in the light of a religious\n      rite -- the oldest and most significant known to man. It is as if the\n      man who starved in Christiania and the western cities of the United States -- not\n      figuratively, but literally -- had once for all conceived a respect for\n      man's principal food that has colored all subsequent life for him and\n      determined his own attitude toward everything by a reference to its\n      connection or lack of connection with that substance.",
                "Taking it all in all, one may well call Hamsun old-fashioned. The virtues\n      winning his praise and the conditions that stir his longings are not of\n      the present day. There is in him something primitive that forms a sharp\n      contrast to the modernity of his own style. Even in his most romantic\n      exaggerations, as in \"Hunger\" and \"Mysteries,\" he is a realist, dealing\n      unrelentingly with life as it appears to us. It would hardly be too much\n      to call his method scientific. But he uses it to aim tremendous explosive\n      charges at those human concentrations that made possible the forging of\n      the weapons he wields so skilfully. Nor does he stop at a wish to see\n      those concentrations scattered. The very ambitions and Utopias bred within\n      them are anathema to his soul, that places simplicity above cleanliness in\n      divine proximity. Characteristically we find that the one art treated with\n      constant sympathy in his writings is that of music, which probably is the\n      earliest and certainly the one least dependent on the herding of men in\n      barracks. In place of what he wishes to take away he offers nothing but\n      peace and the sense of genuine creation that comes to the man who has just\n      garnered the harvests of his own fields into his bulging barns. He is a\n      prophet of plenty, but he has no answer ready when we ask him what we are\n      going to do with it after we have got it. Like a true son of the brooding\n      North, he wishes to set us thinking, but he has no final solutions to\n      offer.",

                "These last few days I have been thinking and thinking of the Nordland\n      summer, with its endless day. Sitting here thinking of that, and of a hut\n      I lived in, and of the woods behind the hut. And writing things down, by\n      way of passing the time; to amuse myself, no more. The time goes very\n      slowly; I cannot get it to pass as quickly as I would, though I have\n      nothing to sorrow for, and live as pleasantly as could be. I am well\n      content withal, and my thirty years are no age to speak of.",
                "A few days back someone sent me two feathers. Two bird's feathers in a\n      sheet of note-paper with a coronet, and fastened with a seal. Sent from a\n      place a long way off; from one who need not have sent them back at all.\n      That amused me too, those devilish green feathers.",
                "And for the rest I have no troubles, unless for a touch of gout now and\n      again in my left foot, from an old bullet-wound, healed long since.",
                "Two years ago, I remember, the time passed quickly -- beyond all\n      comparison more quickly than time now. A summer was gone before I knew.\n      Two years ago it was, in 1855. I will write of it just to amuse myself -- of\n      something that happened to me, or something I dreamed. Now, I have\n      forgotten many things belonging to that time, by having scarcely thought\n      of them since. But I remember that the nights were very light. And many\n      things seemed curious and unnatural. Twelve months to the year -- but\n      night was like day, and never a star to be seen in the sky. And the people\n      I met were strange, and of a different nature from those I had known\n      before; sometimes a single night was enough to make them blossom out from\n      childhood into the full of their glory, ripe and fully grown. No witchery\n      in this; only I had never seen the like before. No.",
                "In a white, roomy home down by the sea I met with one who busied my\n      thoughts for a little time. I do not always think of her now; not any\n      more. No; I have forgotten her. But I think of all the other things: the\n      cry of the sea-birds, my hunting in the woods, my nights, and all the warm\n      hours of that summer. After all, it was only by the merest accident I\n      happened to meet her; save for that, she would never have been in my\n      thoughts for a day.",
                "From the hut where I lived, I could see a confusion of rocks and reefs and\n      islets, and a little of the sea, and a bluish mountain peak or so; behind\n      the hut was the forest. A huge forest it was; and I was glad and grateful\n      beyond measure for the scent of roots and leaves, the thick smell of the\n      fir-sap, that is like the smell of marrow. Only the forest could bring all\n      things to calm within me; my mind was strong and at ease. Day after day I\n      tramped over the wooded hills with \u00c3\u0086sop at my side, and asked no more than\n      leave to keep on going there day after day, though most of the ground was\n      covered still with snow and soft slush. I had no company but \u00c3\u0086sop; now it\n      is Cora, but at that time it was \u00c3\u0086sop, my dog that I afterwards shot.",
                "Often in the evening, when I came back to the hut after being out shooting\n      all day, I could feel that kindly, homely feeling trickling through me\n      from head to foot -- a pleasant little inward shivering. And I would\n      talk to \u00c3\u0086sop about it, saying how comfortable we were. \"There, now we'll\n      get a fire going, and roast a bird on the hearth,\" I would say; \"what do\n      you say to that?\" And when it was done, and we had both fed, \u00c3\u0086sop would\n      slip away to his place behind the hearth, while I lit a pipe and lay down\n      on the bench for a while, listening to the dead soughing of the trees.\n      There was a slight breeze bearing down towards the hut, and I could hear\n      quite clearly the clutter of a grouse far away on the ridge behind. Save\n      for that, all was still.",
                "And many a time I fell asleep there as I lay, just as I was, fully dressed\n      and all, and did not wake till the seabirds began calling. And then,\n      looking out of the window, I could see the big white buildings of the\n      trading station, the landing stage at Girilund, the store where I used to\n      get my bread. And I would lie there a while, wondering how I came to be\n      there, in a hut on the fringe of a forest, away up in Nordland.",
                "Then \u00c3\u0086sop over by the hearth would shake out his long, slender body,\n      rattling his collar, and yawning and wagging his tail, and I would jump\n      up, after those three or four hours of sleep, fully rested and full of joy\n      in everything ... everything.",

On a calm day, the ships\n      seemed hardly to move at all; I could see the same sail for three days,\n      small and white, like a gull on the water. Then, perhaps, if the wind\n      veered round, the peaks in the distance would almost disappear, and there\n      came a storm, the south-westerly gale; a play for me to stand and watch.\n      All things in a seething mist. Earth and sky mingled together, the sea\n      flung up into fantastic dancing figures of men and horses and fluttering\n      banners on the air. I stood in the shelter of an overhanging rock,\n      thinking many things; my soul was tense. Heaven knows, I thought to\n      myself, what it is I am watching here, and why the sea should open before\n      my eyes. Maybe I am seeing now the inner brain of earth, how things are at\n      work there, boiling and foaming. \u00c3\u0086sop was restless; now and again he would\n      thrust up his muzzle and sniff, in a troubled way, with legs quivering\n      uneasily; when I took no notice, he lay down between my feet and stared\n      out to sea as I was doing. And never a cry, never a word of human voice to\n      be heard anywhere; nothing; only the heavy rush of the wind about my head.\n      There was a reef of rocks far out, lying all apart; when the sea raged up\n      over it the water towered like a crazy screw; nay, like a sea-god rising\n      wet in the air, and snorting, till hair and beard stood out like a wheel\n      about his head. Then he plunged down into the breakers once more.",
                "And in the midst of the storm, a little coal-black steamer fighting its\n      way in...",
                "When I went down to the quay in the afternoon, the little coal-black\n      steamer had come in; it was the mail-packet. Many people had gathered on\n      the quayside to see the rare visitor; I noticed that all without exception\n      had blue eyes, however different they might be in other ways. A young girl\n      with a white woolen kerchief over her head stood a little apart; she had\n      very dark hair, and the white kerchief showed up strangely against it. She\n      looked at me curiously, at my leather suit, my gun; when I spoke to her,\n      she was embarrassed, and turned her head away. I said:",
                "\"You should always wear a white kerchief like that; it suits you well.\"",
                "Just then a burly man in an Iceland jersey came up and joined her; he\n      called her Eva. Evidently she was his daughter. I knew the burly man; he\n      was the local smith, the blacksmith. Only a few days back he had mended\n      the nipple of one of my guns...",
                "And rain and wind did their work, and thawed away the snow. For some days\n      a cheerless cold hovered over the earth; rotten branches snapped, and the\n      crows gathered in flocks, complaining. But it was not for long; the sun\n      was near, and one day it rose up behind the forest.",
                "It sends a strip of sweetness through me from head to foot when the sun\n      comes up; I shoulder my gun with quiet delight."

                "I was never short of game those days, but shot all I cared to -- a\n      hare, a grouse, a ptarmigan -- and when I happened to be down near the\n      shore and came within range of some seabird or other, I shot it too. It\n      was a pleasant time; the days grew longer and the air clearer; I packed up\n      things for a couple of days and set off up into the hills, up to the\n      mountain peaks. I met reindeer Lapps, and they gave me cheese -- rich\n      little cheeses tasting of herbs. I went up that way more than once. Then,\n      going home again, I always shot some bird or other to put in my bag. I sat\n      down and put \u00c3\u0086sop on the lead. Miles below me was the sea; the\n      mountainsides were wet and black with the water running down them,\n      dripping and trickling always with the same little sound. That little\n      sound of the water far up on the hills has shortened many an hour for me\n      when I sat looking about. Here, I thought to myself, is a little endless\n      song trickling away all to itself, and no one ever hears it, and no one\n      ever thinks of it, and still it trickles on nevertheless, to itself, all\n      the time, all the time! And I felt that the mountains were no longer quite\n      deserted, as long as I could hear that little trickling song. Now and\n      again something would happen: a clap of thunder shaking the earth, a mass\n      of rock slipping loose and rushing down towards the sea, leaving a trail\n      of smoking dust behind. \u00c3\u0086sop turned his nose to the wind at once, sniffing\n      in surprise at the smell of burning that he could not understand. When the\n      melting of the snow had made rifts in the hillside, a shot, or even a\n      sharp cry, was enough to loosen a great block and send it tumbling down...",
                "An hour might pass, or perhaps more -- the time went so quickly. I let\n      \u00c3\u0086sop loose, slung my bag over the other shoulder, and set off towards\n      home. It was getting late. Lower down in the forest, I came unfailingly\n      upon my old, well-known path, a narrow ribbon of a path, with the\n      strangest bends and turns. I followed each one of them, taking my time -- there\n      was no hurry. No one waiting for me at home. Free as a lord, a ruler, I\n      could ramble about there in the peaceful woods, just as idly as I pleased.\n      All the birds were silent; only the grouse was calling far away -- it\n      was always calling.",
                "I came out of the wood and saw two figures ahead, two persons moving. I\n      came up with them. One was Edwarda, and I recognized her, and gave a\n      greeting; the Doctor was with her. I had to show them my gun; they looked\n      at my compass, my bag; I invited them to my hut, and they promised to come\n      some day.",
                "It was evening now. I went home and lit a fire, roasted a bird, and had a\n      meal. To-morrow there would be another day...",
                "All things quiet and still. I lay that evening looking out the window.\n      There was a fairy glimmer at that hour over wood and field; the sun had\n      gone down, and dyed the horizon with a rich red light that stood there\n      still as oil. The sky all open and clean; I stared into that clear sea,\n      and it seemed as if I were lying face to face with the uttermost depth of\n      the world; my heart beating tensely against it, and at home there. God\n      knows, I thought to myself, God knows why the sky is dressed in gold and\n      mauve to-night, if there is not some festival going on up there in the\n      world, some great feast with music from the stars, and boats gliding along\n      river ways. It looks so! -- And I closed my eyes, and followed the\n      boats, and thoughts and thoughts floated through my mind...",
                "So more than one day passed.",
                "I wandered about, noting how the snow turned to water, how the ice loosed\n      its hold. Many a day I did not even fire a shot, when I had food enough in\n      the hut -- only wandered about in my freedom, and let the time pass.\n      Whichever way I turned, there was always just as much to see and hear -- all\n      things changing a little every day. Even the osier thickets and the\n      juniper stood waiting for the spring. One day I went out to the mill; it\n      was still icebound, but the earth around it had been trampled through many\n      and many a year, showing how men and more men had come that way with sacks\n      of corn on their shoulders, to be ground. It was like walking among human\n      beings to go there; and there were many dates and letters cut in the\n      walls.",

Only a little for my own amusement's sake, and\n      because it passes the time for me to tell of how the spring came two years\n      back, and how everything looked then. Earth and sea began to smell a\n      little; there was a sweetish, rotting smell from the dead leaves in the\n      wood, and the magpies flew with twigs in their beaks, building their\n      nests. A couple of days more, and the brooks began to swell and foam; here\n      and there a butterfly was to be seen, and the fishermen came home from\n      their stations. The trader's two boats came in laden deep with fish, and\n      anchored off the drying grounds; there was life and commotion all of a\n      sudden out on the biggest of the islands, where the fish were to be spread\n      on the rocks to dry. I could see it all from my window.",
                "But no noise reached the hut; I was alone, and remained so. Now and again\n      someone would pass. I saw Eva, the blacksmith's girl; she had got a couple\n      of freckles on her nose.",
                "\"Where are you going?\" I asked.",
                "\"Out for firewood,\" she answered quietly. She had a rope in her hand to\n      carry the wood, and her white kerchief on her head. I stood watching her,\n      but she did not turn round.",
                "After that I saw no one for days.",
                "The spring was urging, and the forest listened; it was a great delight to\n      watch the thrushes sitting in the tree-tops staring at the sun and crying;\n      sometimes I would get up as early as two in the morning, just for a share\n      of the joy that went out from bird and beast at sunrise.",
                "The spring had reached me too, maybe, and my blood beat at times as if it\n      were footsteps. I sat in the hut, and thought of overhauling my fishing\n      rods and lines and gear, but moved never a finger to any work at all, for\n      a glad, mysterious restlessness that was in and out of my heart all the\n      while. Then suddenly \u00c3\u0086sop sprang up, stood and stiffened, and gave a short\n      bark. Someone coming to the hut! I pulled off my cap quickly, and heard\n      Edwarda's voice already at the door. Kindly and without ceremony she and\n      the Doctor had come to pay me a visit, as they had said.",
                "\"Yes,\" I heard her say, \"he is at home.\" And she stepped forward, and gave\n      me her hand in her simple girlish way. \"We were here yesterday, but you\n      were out,\" she said.",
                "She sat down on the rug over my wooden bedstead and looked round the hut;\n      the Doctor sat down beside me on the long bench. We talked, chatted away\n      at ease; I told them things, such as what kinds of animals there were in\n      the woods, and what game I could not shoot because of the closed season.\n      It was the closed season for grouse just now.",
                "The Doctor did not say much this time either, but catching sight of my\n      powder-horn, with a figure of Pan carved on it, he started to explain the\n      myth of Pan.",
                "\"But,\" said Edwarda suddenly, \"what do you live on when it's closed season\n      for all game?\"",
                "\"Fish,\" I said. \"Fish mostly. But there's always something to eat.\"",
                "\"But you might come up to us for your meals,\" she said. \"There was an\n      Englishman here last year -- he had taken the hut -- and he often\n      came to us for meals.\"",
                "Edwarda looked at me and I at her. I felt at the moment something touching\n      my heart like a little fleeting welcome. It must have been the spring, and\n      the bright day; I have thought it over since. Also, I admired the curve of\n      her eyebrows.",
                "She said something about my place; how I had arranged things in the hut. I\n      had hung up skins of several sorts on the walls, and birds' wings; it\n      looked like a shaggy den on the inside. She liked it. \"Yes, a den,\" she\n      said.",
                "I had nothing to offer my visitors that they would care about; I thought\n      of it, and would have roasted a bird for them, just for amusement -- let\n      them eat it hunter's fashion, with their fingers. It might amuse them.",
                "And I cooked the bird.",
                "Edwarda told about the Englishman. An old man, an eccentric, who talked\n      aloud to himself. He was a Roman Catholic, and always carried a little\n      prayer-book, with red and black letters, about with him wherever he went.",
                "\"Was he an Irishman then?\" asked the Doctor.",

                "When I had seen my visitors a few steps on their way, I walked home again\n      and sat down to work at my fishing gear. My hand-net had been hung from a\n      nail by the door, and several of the meshes were damaged by rust; I\n      sharpened up some hooks, knotted them to lengths of line, and looked to\n      the other nets. How hard it seemed to do any work at all to-day! Thoughts\n      that had nothing to do with the business in hand kept coming and going; it\n      occurred to me that I had done wrong in letting Edwarda sit on the bed all\n      the time, instead of offering her a seat on the bench. I saw before me\n      suddenly her brown face and neck; she had fastened her apron a little low\n      down in front, to be long-waisted, as was the fashion; the girlish contour\n      of her thumb affected me tenderly, and the little wrinkles above the\n      knuckle were full of kindliness. Her mouth was large and rich.",
                "I rose up and opened the door and looked out. I could hear nothing, and\n      indeed there was nothing to listen for. I closed the door again; \u00c3\u0086sop came\n      up from his resting-place and noticed that I was restless about something.\n      Then it struck me that I might run after Edwarda and ask her for a little\n      silk thread to mend my net with. It would not be any pretence -- I\n      could take down the net and show her where the meshes were spoiled by\n      rust. I was already outside the door when I remembered that I had silk\n      thread myself in my fly-book; more indeed than I wanted. And I went back\n      slowly, discouraged -- to think that I had silk thread myself.",

Perhaps they may be going for a walk\n      that way again -- perhaps, perhaps not.\" But why should I think of\n      those two in particular?

A green worm thing, a\n      caterpillar, dragged itself end by end along a branch, dragging along\n      unceasingly, as if it could not rest. It saw hardly anything, for all it\n      had eyes; often it stood straight up in the air, feeling about for\n      something to take hold of; it looked like a stump of green thread sewing a\n      seam with long stitches along the branch. By evening, perhaps, it would\n      have reached its goal.",

Two hours to wait; a little restless already, I brush the\n      dust and heather from my clothes. I know the places I pass by, trees and\n      stones stand there as before in their solitude; the leaves rustle\n      underfoot as I walk. The monotonous breathing and the familiar trees and\n      stones mean much to me; I am filled with a strange thankfulness;\n      everything seems well disposed towards me, mingles with my being; I love\n      it all. I pick up a little dry twig and hold it in my hand and sit looking\n      at it, and think my own thoughts; the twig is almost rotten, its poor bark\n      touches me, pity fills my heart. And when I get up again, I do not throw\n      the twig far away, but lay it down, and stand liking it; at last I look at\n      it once more with wet eyes before I go away and leave it there.",

I am quite aware of all this, but none the less there is\n      an hour yet before six o'clock, so I get up again and go on a little. And\n      the leaves rustle under foot. An hour goes that way.",

The mill is working; the noise of it\n      wakes me, and I stop suddenly, there and then. \"I have stayed out too\n      long,\" I say aloud. A pang goes through me; I turn at once and begin\n      walking homewards, but all the time I know I have stayed out too long. I\n      walk faster, then run; \u00c3\u0086sop understands there is something the matter, and\n      pulls at the leash, drags me along, sniffs at the ground, and is all\n      haste.

At last Herr\n      Mack broke off the game, saying that his assistants must go to bed; then\n      he leaned back on the sofa and began talking about putting up a sign in\n      front of his place. He asked my advice about it. What colour did I think\n      would be best? I was not interested, and answered \"black,\" without\n      thinking at all. And Herr Mack at once agreed:",
                "\"Black, yes -- exactly what I had been thinking myself. 'Salt and\n      barrels' in heavy black letters -- that ought to look as nice as\n      anything... Edwarda, isn't it time you were going to bed?\"",
                "Edwarda rose, shook hands with us both, said good-night, and left the\n      room. We sat on. We talked of the railway that had been finished last\n      year, and of the first telegraph line. \"Wonder when we shall have the\n      telegraph up here.\"",
                "Pause.",

You might see me in the\n      daytime and say I was a young man, but when the evening comes along, and\n      I'm all alone, I feel it a good deal. I sit here mostly playing patience.\n      It works out all right as a rule, if you fudge a little. Haha!\"",

I rose in my turn.\n      He looked round and walked towards me in his long, pointed shoes, stuck\n      both thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, waved his arms a little, as if they\n      were wings, and smiled. Then he offered me his boat again if ever I wanted\n      one, and held out his hand.",
                "\"Wait a minute -- I'll go with you,\" he said, and blew out the lamps.\n      \"Yes, yes, I feel like a little walk. It's not so late.\"",

                "We set off, and he was soon lost to sight in the wood.",
                "I walked at my usual pace, and reckoned to be there a good five minutes\n      ahead. But when I got to the hut he was there already. He called out as I\n      came up:",

                "I stood there and thought to myself: This is strange! I ought to be some\n      judge of distance, and I've walked both those ways several times. My good\n      man, you've been fudging again. Was the whole thing a pretence?",
                "I saw his back as he disappeared into the wood again.",
                "Next moment I started off in track of him, going quickly and cautiously; I\n      could see him wiping his face all the way, and I was not so sure now that\n      he had not been running before. I walked very slowly now, and watched him\n      carefully; he stopped at the blacksmith's. I stepped into hiding, and saw\n      the door open, and Herr Mack enter the house.",

I had never before known what it was to be\n      so alone as on the first of those days. It was full spring now; I had\n      found wintergreen and milfoil already, and the chaffinches had come (I\n      knew all the birds). Now and again I took a couple of coins from my pocket\n      and rattled them, to break the loneliness. I thought to myself: \"What if\n      Diderik and Iselin were to appear!\"",

I could feel more\n      strangely on those nights than anyone would believe. Was Pan himself\n      there, sitting in a tree, watching me to see what I might do? Was his\n      belly open, and he sitting there bent over as if drinking from his own\n      belly? But all that he did only that he might look up under his brows and\n      watch me; and the whole tree shook with his silent laughter when he saw\n      how all my thoughts were running away with me. There was a rustling\n      everywhere in the woods, beasts sniffing, birds calling one to another;\n      their signals filled the air. And it was flying year for the Maybug; its\n      humming mingled with the buzz of the night moths, sounded like a\n      whispering here and a whispering there, all about in the woods. So much\n      there was to hear! For three nights I did not sleep; I thought of Diderik\n      and Iselin.",
                "\"See now,\" I thought, \"they might come.\" And Iselin would lead Diderik\n      away to a tree and say:",

                "\"Tie my shoe-string,\" she says, with flushed cheeks. ...",
                "The sun dips down into the sea and rises again, red and refreshed, as if\n      it had been to drink. And the air is full of whisperings.",

A girl came from herding goats; she fastened her stocking and\n      hummed a tune and looked around. But where was her flock? And what was she\n      doing in the woods at midnight? Ah, nothing, nothing. Walking there for\n      restlessness, perhaps, for joy; 'twas her affair. I thought to myself, she\n      had heard \u00c3\u0086sop in the woods, and knew that I was out.",

And\n      something about her called up a feeling of tenderness in me; she looked so\n      helpless, I remembered that she had no mother; her thin arms gave her an\n      ill-cared-for appearance. I could not help feeling it so.",
                "Well, I did not go out shooting just to murder things, but to live. I had\n      need of one grouse to-day, and so I did not shoot two, but would shoot the\n      other to-morrow. Why kill more? I lived in the woods, as a son of the\n      woods. And from the first of June it was closed time for hare and\n      ptarmigan; there was but little left for me to shoot at all now. Well and\n      good: then I could go fishing, and live on fish. I would borrow her\n      father's boat and row out in that. No, indeed, I did no go out shooting\n      for the lust of killing things, but only to live in the woods. It was a\n      good place for me; I could lie down on the ground at meals, instead of\n      sitting upright on a chair; I did not upset my glass there. In the woods I\n      could do as I pleased; I could lie down flat on my back and close my eyes\n      if I pleased, and I could say whatever I liked to say. Often one might\n      feel a wish to say something, to speak aloud, and in the woods it sounded\n      like speech from the very heart...",
                "When I asked her if she understood all this, she said, \"Yes.\"",
                "And I went on, and told her more, because her eyes were on me. \"If you\n      only knew all that I see out in the wilds!\" I said. \"In winter, I come\n      walking along, and see, perhaps, the tracks of ptarmigan in the snow.\n      Suddenly the track disappears; the bird has taken wing. But from the marks\n      of the wings I can see which way the game has flown, and before long I\n      have tracked it down again. There is always a touch of newness in that for\n      me. In autumn, many a time there are shooting stars to watch. Then I think\n      to myself, being all alone, What was that? A world seized with convulsions\n      all of a sudden? A world going all to pieces before my eyes? To think that\n      I -- that I should be granted the sight of shooting stars in my\n      life! And when summer comes, then perhaps there may be a little living\n      creature on every leaf; I can see that some of them have no wings; they\n      can make no great way in the world, but must live and die on that one\n      little leaf where they came into the world.",

I look at a single blade of grass;\n      it quivers a little, maybe, and thinks me something. And I think to\n      myself: Here is a little blade of grass all a-quivering. Or if it happens\n      to be a fir tree I look at, then maybe the tree has one branch that makes\n      me think of it a little, too.

People imagined hell as a sort of house down under the ground,\n      with the devil as host -- or rather as sovereign lord. Then he spoke of\n      the altar picture in the chapel, a figure of the Christ, with a few Jews\n      and Jewesses; water into wine -- well and good. But Christ had a halo\n      round His head.

                "And he knelt on the grass before the two ladies, and instead of taking his\n      hat off and laying it before him he held it straight up in the air with\n      one hand, and emptied his glass with his head bent back. I was altogether\n      carried away by his wonderful ease of manner, and would have drunk with\n      him myself but that his glass was empty.",
                "Edwarda was following him with her eyes. I placed myself near her, and\n      said:",
                "\"Shall we play 'Enke' to-day?\"",
                "She started slightly, and got up.",
                "\"Be careful not to say 'Du' to each other now,\" she whispered.",
                "Now I had not said \"Du\" at all. I walked away.",
                "Another hour passed. The day was getting long; I would have rowed home\n      alone long before if there had been a third boat; \u00c3\u0086sop lay tied up in the\n      hut, and perhaps he was thinking of me. Edwarda's thoughts must surely be\n      far away from me; she talked of how lovely it would be to travel, and see\n      strange places; her cheeks flushed at the thought, and she even stumbled\n      in her speech:",
                "\"No one could be more happier than I the day ...\"",

                "She longed to be away; she did not think of me. I stood there, and read in\n      her face that she had forgotten me. Well, there was nothing to be said -- but\n      I stood there myself and saw it in her face. And the minutes dragged so\n      miserably slowly by! I asked several of the others if we ought not to row\n      back now; it was getting late, I said, and \u00c3\u0086sop was tied up in the hut.\n      But none of them wanted to go back.",
                "I went over again to the Dean's daughter, for the third time; I thought\n      she must be the one that had said I had eyes like an animal's. We drank\n      together; she had quivering eyes, they were never still; she kept looking\n      at me and then looking away, all the time.",

                "I spoke loudly, very loudly, and I did so on purpose. And I went on\n      speaking loudly, and asked that young lady once more if she would not like\n      to come up one day and see my hut. \"Heaven bless you for it,\" I said in my\n      distress, and I was already thinking to myself how, perhaps, I might find\n      something to give her as a present if she came. Perhaps I had nothing to\n      give her but my powder-horn, I thought.",

The Doctor told the young ladies' fortunes by their hands,\n      and talked a lot; he himself had small, delicate hands, with a ring on one\n      finger. I felt myself unwanted, and sat down by myself awhile on a stone.\n      It was getting late in the afternoon. Here I am, I said to myself, sitting\n      all alone on a stone, and the only creature that could make me move, she\n      lets me sit. Well, then, I care no more than she.",
                "A great feeling of forsakenness came over me. I could hear them talking\n      behind me, and I heard how Edwarda laughed; and at that I got up suddenly\n      and went over to the party. My excitement ran away with me.",
                "\"Just a moment,\" I said. \"It occurred to me while I was sitting there that\n      perhaps you might like to see my fly-book.\" And I took it out. \"I am sorry\n      I did not think of it before. Just look through it, if you please; I\n      should be only too delighted. You must all see it; there are both red and\n      yellow flies in it.\" And I held my cap in my hand as I spoke. I was myself\n      aware that I had taken off my cap, and I knew that this was wrong, so I\n      put it on again at once.",
                "There was deep silence for a moment, and no one offered to take the book.\n      At last the Doctor reached out his hand for it and said politely:",
                "\"Thanks very much; let us look at the things. It's always been a marvel to\n      me how those flies were put together.\"",
                "\"I make them myself,\" I said, full of gratitude. And I went on at once to\n      explain how it was done. It was simple enough: I bought the feathers and\n      the hooks. They were not well made, but they were only for my own use. One\n      could get ready-made flies in the shops, and they were beautiful things.",
                "Edwarda cast one careless glance at me and my book, and went on talking\n      with her girl friends.",
                "\"Ah, here are some of the feathers,\" said the Doctor. \"Look, these are\n      really fine.\"",
                "Edwarda looked up.",
                "\"The green ones are pretty,\" she said; \"let me look, Doctor.\"",
                "\"Keep them,\" I cried. \"Yes, do, I beg you, now. Two green feathers. Do, as\n      a kindness, let them be a keepsake.\"",
                "She looked at them and said:",
                "\"They are green and gold, as you turn them in the sun. Thank you, if you\n      will give me them.\"",
                "\"I should be glad to,\" I said.",
                "And she took the feathers.",
                "A little later the Doctor handed me the book and thanked me. Then he got\n      up and asked if it were not nearly time to be getting back.",
                "I said: \"Yes, for Heaven's sake. I have a dog tied up at home; look you, I\n      have a dog, and he is my friend; he lies there thinking of me, and when I\n      come home he stands with his forepaws at the window to greet me. It has\n      been a lovely day, and now it is nearly over; let us go back. I am\n      grateful to you all.\"",
                "I waited on the shore to see which boat Edwarda chose, and made up my mind\n      to go in the other one myself. Suddenly she called me. I looked at her in\n      surprise; her face was flushed. Then she came up to me, held out her hand,\n      and said tenderly:",
                "\"Thank you for the feathers. You will come in the boat with me, won't\n      you?\"",
                "\"If you wish it,\" I said.",
                "We got into the boat, and she sat down beside me on the same seat, her\n      knee touching mine. I looked at her, and she glanced at me for a moment in\n      return. I began to feel myself repaid for that bitter day, and was growing\n      happy again, when she suddenly changed her position, turned her back to\n      me, and began talking to the Doctor, who was sitting at the rudder.",
                "For a full quarter of an hour I did not exist for her. Then I did\n      something I repent of, and have not yet forgotten. Her shoe fell off: I\n      snatched it up and flung it far out into the water, for pure joy that she\n      was near, or from some impulse to make myself remarked, to remind her of\n      my existence -- I do not know. It all happened so suddenly I did not\n      think, only felt that impulse.",
                "The ladies set up a cry. I myself was as if paralyzed by what I had done,\n      but what was the good of that? It was done. The Doctor came to my help; he\n      cried \"Row,\" and steered towards the shoe. And the next moment the boatman\n      had caught hold of the shoe just as it had filled with water and was\n      sinking; the man's arm was wet up to the elbow. Then there was a shout of\n      \"Hurra\" from many in the boats, because the shoe was saved.",
                "I was deeply ashamed, and felt that my face changed color and winced, as I\n      wiped the shoe with my handkerchief. Edwarda took it without a word. Not\n      till a little while after did she say:",
                "\"I never saw such a thing!\"",
                "\"No, did you ever?\" I said. And I smiled and pulled myself together,\n      making as if I had played that trick for some particular reason -- as\n      if there were something behind it. But what could there be? The Doctor\n      looked at me, for the first time, contemptuously.",
                "A little time passed; the boats glided homeward; the feeling of\n      awkwardness among the party disappeared; we sang; we were nearing the\n      land. Edwarda said:",
                "\"Oh, we haven't finished the wine: there is ever so much left. We must\n      have another party, a new party later on; we must have a dance, a ball in\n      the big room.\"",
                "When we went ashore I made an apology to Edwarda.",
                "\"If you knew how I wished myself back in my hut!\" I said. \"This has been a\n      long and painful day.\"",
                "\"Has it been a painful day for you, Lieutenant?\"",
                "\"I mean,\" said I, trying to pass it off, \"I mean, I have caused\n      unpleasantness both to myself and others. I threw your shoe into the\n      water.\"",
                "\"Yes -- an extraordinary thing to do.\"",

                "\"I don't know what it is,\" she said. \"Everything, perhaps. I wish all\n      these people would go away at once, all of them. No, not you -- remember,\n      you must stay till the last.\"",
                "And again her words revived me, and my eyes saw the light in the\n      sun-filled room. The Dean's daughter came over, and began talking to me; I\n      wished her ever so far away, and gave her short answers. And I purposely\n      kept from looking at her, for she had said that about my eyes being like\n      an animal's. She turned to Edwarda and told her that once, somewhere\n      abroad -- in Riga I think it was -- a man had followed her along the\n      street.",

                "\"Why, was he blind, then?\" I broke in, thinking to please Edwarda. And I\n      shrugged my shoulders as well.",
                "The young lady understood my coarseness at once, and answered:",
                "\"He must have been blind indeed, to run after any one so old and ugly as I\n      am.\"",
                "But I gained no thanks from Edwarda for that: she drew her friend away;\n      they whispered together and shook their heads. After that, I was left\n      altogether to myself.",
                "Another hour passed. The seabirds began to wake out on the reefs; their\n      cries sounded in through the open windows. A spasm of joy went through me\n      at this first calling of the birds, and I longed to be out there on the\n      islands myself...",
                "The Doctor, once more in good humor, drew the attention of all present.\n      The ladies were never tired of his society. Is that thing there my rival?\n      I thought, noting his lame leg and miserable figure. He had taken to a new\n      and amusing oath: he said D\u00c3\u00b6d og Pinsel, [Footnote: A slight\n      variation of the usual D\u00c3\u00b6d og Pine (death and torture).] and every time he\n      used that comical expression I laughed aloud. In my misery I wished to\n      give the fellow every advantage I could, since he was my rival. I let it\n      be \"Doctor\" here and \"Doctor\" there, and called out myself: \"Listen to the\n      Doctor!\" and laughed aloud at the things he said.",
                "\"I love this world,\" said the Doctor. \"I cling to life tooth and nail. And\n      when I come to die, then I hope to find a corner somewhere straight up\n      over London and Paris, where I can hear the rumble of the human cancan all\n      the time, all the time.\"",

                "Edwarda too seemed delighted.",
                "When the guests began to go, I slipped away into the little room at the\n      side and sat down to wait. I heard one after another saying good-bye on\n      the stairs; the Doctor also took his leave and went. Soon all the voices\n      had died away. My heart beat violently as I waited.",
                "Edwarda came in again. At sight of me she stood a moment in surprise; then\n      she said with a smile:",
                "\"Oh, are you there? It was kind of you to wait till the last. I am tired\n      out now.\"",
                "She remained standing.",
                "I got up then, and said: \"You will be wanting rest now. I hope you are not\n      displeased any more, Edwarda. You were so unhappy a while back, and it\n      hurt me.\"",
                "\"It will be all right when I have slept.\"",
                "I had no more to add. I went towards the door.",
                "\"Thank you,\" she said, offering her hand. \"It was a pleasant evening.\" She\n      would have seen me to the door, but I tried to prevent her.",
                "\"No need,\" I said; \"do not trouble, I can find my way...\"",
                "But she went with me all the same. She stood in the passage waiting\n      patiently while I found my cap, my gun, and my bag. There was a\n      walking-stick in the corner; I saw it well enough; I stared at it, and\n      recognized it -- it was the Doctor's. When she marked what I was\n      looking at, she blushed in confusion; it was plain to see from her face\n      that she was innocent, that she knew nothing of the stick. A whole minute\n      passed. At last she turned, furiously impatient, and said tremblingly:",
                "\"Your stick -- do not forget your stick.\"",
                "And there before my eyes she handed me the Doctor's stick.",
                "I looked at her. She was still holding out the stick; her hand trembled.\n      To make an end of it, I took the thing, and set it back in the corner. I\n      said:",
                "\"It is the Doctor's stick. I cannot understand how a lame man could forget\n      his stick.\" \"You and your lame man!\" she cried bitterly, and took a step\n      forward towards me. \"You are not lame -- no; but even if you were, you\n      could not compare with him; no, you could never compare with him. There!\"",
                "I sought for some answer, but my mind was suddenly empty; I was silent.\n      With a deep bow, I stepped backwards out of the door, and down on to the\n      steps. There I stood a moment looking straight before me; then I moved\n      off.",
                "\"So, he has forgotten his stick,\" I thought to myself. \"And he will come\n      back this way to fetch it. He would not let me be the last man to\n      leave the house...\" I walked up the road very slowly, keeping a lookout\n      either way, and stopped at the edge of the wood. At last, after half an\n      hour's waiting, the Doctor came walking towards me; he had seen me, and\n      was walking quickly. Before he had time to speak I lifted my cap, to try\n      him. He raised his hat in return. I went straight up to him and said:",
                "\"I gave you no greeting.\"",
                "He came a step nearer and stared at me.",
                "\"You gave me no greeting...?\"",
                "\"No,\" said I.",
                "Pause.",
                "\"Why, it is all the same to me what you did,\" he said, turning pale. \"I\n      was going to fetch my stick; I left it behind.\" I could say nothing in\n      answer to this, but I took my revenge another way; I stretched out my gun\n      before him, as if he were a dog, and said:",
                "\"Over!\"",
                "And I whistled, as if coaxing him to jump over.",
                "For a moment he struggled with himself; his face took on the strangest\n      play of expression as he pressed his lips together and held his eyes fixed\n      on the ground. Suddenly he looked at me sharply; a half smile lit up his\n      features, and he said:",
                "\"What do you really mean by all this?\"",
                "I did not answer, but his words affected me.",
                "Suddenly he held out his hand to me, and said gently:",
                "\"There is something wrong with you. If you will tell me what it is, then\n      perhaps...\"",
                "I was overwhelmed now with shame and despair; his calm words made me lose\n      my balance. I wished to show him some kindness in return, and I put my arm\n      round him, and said:",
                "\"Forgive me this! No, what could be wrong with me? There is nothing wrong;\n      I have no need of your help. You are looking for Edwarda, perhaps? You\n      will find her at home. But make haste, or she will have gone to bed before\n      you come; she was very tired, I could see it myself. I tell you the best\n      news I can, now; it is true. You will find her at home -- go, then!\"\n       And I turned and hurried away from him, striking out with a long stride up\n      through the woods and back to the hut.",
                "For a while I sat there on the bed just as I had come in, with my bag over\n      my shoulder and my gun in my hand. Strange thoughts passed through my\n      mind. Why ever had I given myself away so to that Doctor? The thought that\n      I had put my arm round him and looked at him with wet eyes angered me; he\n      would chuckle over it, I thought; perhaps at that very moment he might be\n      sitting laughing over it, with Edwarda. He had set his stick aside in the\n      hall. Yes, even if I were lame, I could not compare with the Doctor. I\n      could never compare with him -- those were her words...",
                "I stepped out into the middle of the floor, cocked my gun, set the muzzle\n      against my left instep, and pulled the trigger. The shot passed through\n      the middle of the foot and pierced the floor. \u00c3\u0086sop gave a short terrified\n      bark.",
                "A little after there came a knock at the door.",
                "It was the Doctor.",
                "\"Sorry to disturb you,\" he began. \"You went off so suddenly, I thought it\n      might do no harm if we had a little talk together. Smell of powder, isn't\n      there...?\"",
                "He was perfectly sober. \"Did you see Edwarda? Did you get your stick?\" I\n      asked.",
                "\"I found my stick. But Edwarda had gone to bed... What's that? Heavens,\n      man, you're bleeding!\"",
                "\"No, nothing to speak of. I was just putting the gun away, and it went\n      off; it's nothing. Devil take you, am I obliged to sit here and give you\n      all sorts of information about that...? You found your stick?\"",
                "But he did not heed my words; he was staring at my torn boot and the\n      trickle of blood. With a quick movement he laid down his stick and took\n      off his gloves.",
                "\"Sit still -- I must get that boot off. I thought it was a shot\n      I heard.\""

Well, and then...",
                "One day the Doctor began talking about Edwarda.

No fear of that! Warm? Ice, I\n      say. What is she, then? A slip of a girl, sixteen or seventeen -- exactly.\n      But try to make an impression on that slip of a girl, and she will laugh\n      you to scorn for your trouble.

And with a single glance,\n      or a word, she'll have you ten leagues away. Do you think I don't know\n      her? How old do you reckon her to be?\" \"She was born in '38, she said.\"",
                "\"A lie. I looked it up, out of curiosity. She's twenty, though she might\n      well pass for fifteen.

When she stands looking out at the hills and the\n      sea, and her mouth gives that little twitch, that little spasm of pain,\n      then she is suffering; but she is too proud, too obstinate for tears. She\n      is more than a bit romantic; a powerful imagination; she is waiting for a\n      prince. What was that about a certain five-daler note you were\n      supposed to have given someone?\"",
                "\"A jest. It was nothing...\"",
                "\"It was something all the same. She did something of the same sort with me\n      once. It's a year ago now. We were on board the mail-packet while it was\n      lying here in the harbour. It was raining, and very cold. A woman with a\n      child in her arms was sitting on deck, shivering. Edwarda asked her:\n      'Don't you feel cold?' Yes, she did. 'And the little one too?' Yes, the\n      little one was cold as well. 'Why don't you go into the cabin?' asks\n      Edwarda. 'I've only a steerage ticket,' says the woman. Edwarda looks at\n      me. 'The woman here has only a steerage ticket,' she says. 'Well, and what\n      then?' I say to myself. But I understand her look. I'm not a rich man;\n      what I have I've worked to earn, and I think twice before I spend it; so I\n      move away. If Edwarda wants someone to pay for the woman, let her do it\n      herself; she and her father can better afford it than I. And sure enough,\n      Edwarda paid. She's splendid in that way -- no one can say she hasn't a\n      heart. But as true as I'm sitting here she expected me to pay for a saloon\n      passage for the woman and child; I could see it in her eyes. And what\n      then, do you think? The woman gets up and thanks her for her kindness.\n      'Don't thank me -- it was that gentleman there,' says Edwarda, pointing\n      to me as calmly as could be. What do you think of that? The woman thanks\n      me too; and what can I say? Simply had to leave it as it was. That's just\n      one thing about her. But I could tell you many more. And as for the five\n      daler to the boatman -- she gave him the money herself. If you\n      had done it, she would have flung her arms round you and kissed you on the\n      spot. You should have been the lordly cavalier that paid an extravagant\n      sum for a worn-out shoe -- that would have suited her ideas; she\n      expected it. And as you didn't -- she did it herself in your name.\n      That's her way -- reckless and calculating at the same time.\"",
                "\"Is there no one, then, that can win her?\" I asked.",
                "\"Severity's what she wants,\" said the Doctor, evading the question.\n      \"There's something wrong about it all; she has too free a hand; she can do\n      as she pleases, and have her own way all the time. People take notice of\n      her; no one ever disregards her; there is always something at hand for her\n      to work on with effect. Have you noticed the way I treat her myself? Like\n      a schoolgirl, a child; I order her about, criticise her way of speaking,\n      watch her carefully, and show her up now and again. Do you think she\n      doesn't understand it? Oh, she's stiff and proud, it hurts her every time;\n      but then again she is too proud to show it. But that's the way she should\n      be handled. When you came up here I had been at her for a year like that,\n      and it was beginning to tell; she cried with pain and vexation; she was\n      growing more reasonable. Then you came along and upset it all. That's the\n      way it goes -- one lets go of her and another takes her up again. After\n      you, there'll be a third, I suppose -- you never know.\"",
                "\"Oho,\" thought I to myself, \"the Doctor has something to revenge.\" And I\n      said:",
                "\"Doctor, what made you trouble to tell me all that long story? What was it\n      for? Am I to help you with her upbringing?\"",
                "\"And then she's fiery as a volcano,\" he went on, never heeding my\n      question. \"You asked if no one could ever win her? I don't see why not.\n      She is waiting for her prince, and he hasn't come yet. Again and again she\n      thinks she's found him, and finds out she's wrong; she thought you were\n      the one, especially because you had eyes like an animal. Haha! I say,\n      though, Herr Lieutenant, you ought at least to have brought your uniform\n      with you. It would have been useful now. Why shouldn't she be won? I have\n      seen her wringing her hands with longing for someone to come and take her,\n      carry her away, rule over her, body and soul. Yes ... but he must come\n      from somewhere -- turn up suddenly one day, and be something out of the\n      ordinary. I have an idea that Herr Mack is out on an expedition; there's\n      something behind this journey of his. He went off like that once before,\n      and brought a man back with him.\"",
                "\"Brought a man back with him?\"",
                "\"Oh, but he was no good,\" said the Doctor, with a wry laugh. \"He was a man\n      about my own age, and lame, too, like myself. He wouldn't do for the\n      prince.\"",
                "\"And he went away again? Where did he go?\" I asked, looking fixedly at\n      him.",
                "\"Where? Went away? Oh, I don't know,\" he answered confusedly. \"Well, well,\n      we've been talking too long about this already. That foot of yours -- oh,\n      you can begin to walk in a week's time. Au revoir.\""

I hope you will forgive me for coming up like this\n      without letting you know; I ran nearly all the way...\"",
                "She bent over me, she was close to me, I felt her breath on my face; I\n      reached out my hands to hold her. Then she moved away a little. Her eyes\n      were still dewy.",
                "\"It happened this way,\" I stammered out. \"I was putting the gun away in\n      the corner, but I held it awkwardly -- up and down, like that; then\n      suddenly I heard the shot. It was an accident.\"",
                "\"An accident,\" she said thoughtfully, nodding her head. \"Let me see -- it\n      is the left foot -- but why the left more than the right? Yes, of\n      course, an accident...\"",
                "\"Yes, an accident,\" I broke in. \"How should I know why it just happened to\n      be the left foot? You can see for yourself -- that's how I was holding\n      the gun -- it couldn't be the right foot that way. It was a nuisance,\n      of course.\" She looked at me curiously.",
                "\"Well, and so you are getting on nicely,\" she said, looking around the\n      hut. \"Why didn't you send the woman down to us for food? What have you\n      been living on?\"",
                "We went on talking for a few minutes. I asked her:",
                "\"When you came in, your face was moved, and your eyes sparkled; you gave\n      me your hand. But now your eyes are cold again. Am I wrong?\"",

                "\"Nothing, Glahn. Just thoughts that come at times. Are you angry now?\n      Remember, some give a little, but it is much for them to give; others can\n      give much, and it costs them nothing -- and which has given more? You\n      have grown melancholy in your illness. How did we come to talk of all\n      this?\" And suddenly she looked at me, her face flushed with joy. \"But you\n      must get well soon, now. We shall meet again.\"",
                "And she held out her hand. Then it came into my head not to take her hand.\n      I stood up, put my hands behind my back, and bowed deeply; that was to\n      thank her for her kindness in coming to pay me a visit.",
                "\"You must excuse me if I cannot see you home,\" I said.",

                "I was happy and weary; all the creatures came up close and looked at me;\n      there were insects on the trees and oil-beetles crawling on the road. Well\n      met! I said to myself. The feeling of the woods went through and through\n      my senses; I cried for love of it all, and was utterly happy; I was\n      dissolved in thanksgiving. Dear woods, my home, God's peace with you from\n      my heart... I stopped and turned all ways, named the things with tears.\n      Birds and trees and stones and grass and ants, I called them all by name,\n      looked round and called them all in their order. I looked up to the hills\n      and thought: Now, now I am coming, as if in answer to their calling. Far\n      above, the dwarf falcon was hacking away -- I knew where its nests\n      were. But the sound of those falcons up in the hills sent my thoughts far\n      away.",
                "About noon I rowed out and landed on a little island, an islet outside the\n      harbour. There were mauve-coloured flowers with long stalks reaching to my\n      knees; I waded in strange growths, raspberry and coarse grass; there were\n      no animals, and perhaps there had never been any human being there. The\n      sea foamed gently against the rocks and wrapped me in a veil of murmuring;\n      far up on the egg-cliffs, all the birds of the coast were flying and\n      screaming. But the sea wrapped me round on all sides as in an embrace.\n      Blessed be life and earth and sky, blessed be my enemies; in this hour I\n      will be gracious to my bitterest enemy, and bind the latchet of his\n      shoe...",
                "\"Hiv ... ohoi...\" Sounds from one of Herr Mack's craft. My heart\n      was filled with sunshine at the well-known song. I rowed to the quay,\n      walked up past the fishers' huts and home. The day was at an end. I had my\n      meal, sharing it with \u00c3\u0086sop, and set out into the woods once more. Soft\n      winds breathed silently in my face. And I blessed the winds because they\n      touched my face; I told them that I blessed them; my very blood sang in my\n      veins for thankfulness. \u00c3\u0086sop laid one paw on my knee.",
                "Weariness came over me; I fell asleep.",
                "Lul! lul! Bells ringing! Some leagues out at sea rose a mountain. I\n      said two prayers, one for my dog and one for myself, and we entered into\n      the mountain there. The gate closed behind us; I started at its clang, and\n      woke.",
                "Flaming red sky, the sun there stamping before my eyes; the night, the\n      horizon, echoing with light. \u00c3\u0086sop and I moved into the shade. All quiet\n      around us. \"No, we will not sleep now,\" I said to the dog, \"we will go out\n      hunting tomorrow; the red sun is shining on us, we will not go into the\n      mountain.\" ... And strange thoughts woke to life in me, and the blood rose\n      to my head.",
                "Excited, yet still weak, I felt someone kissing me, and the kiss lay on my\n      lips. I looked round: there was nothing visible. \"Iselin!\" A sound in the\n      grass -- it might be a leaf falling to the ground, or it might be\n      footsteps. A shiver through the woods -- and I told myself it might be\n      Iselin's breathing. Here in these woods she has moved, Iselin; here she\n      has listened to the prayers of yellow-booted, green-cloaked huntsmen. She\n      lived out on my farm, two miles away; four generations ago she sat at her\n      window, and heard the echo of horns in the forest. There were reindeer and\n      wolf and bear, and the hunters were many, and all of them had seen her\n      grow up from a child, and each and all of them had waited for her. One had\n      seen her eyes, another heard her voice. When she was twelve years old came\n      Dundas. He was a Scotsman, and traded in fish, and had many ships. He had\n      a son. When she was sixteen, she saw young Dundas for the first time. He\n      was her first love...",
                "And such strange fancies flowed through me, and my head grew very heavy as\n      I sat there; I closed my eyes and felt for Iselin's kiss. Iselin, are you\n      here, lover of life? And have you Diderik there? ... But my head grew\n      heavier still, and I floated off on the waves of sleep.",
                "Lul! lul! A voice speaking, as if the Seven Stars themselves were\n      singing through my blood; Iselin's voice:",
                "\"Sleep, sleep! I will tell you of my love while you sleep. I was sixteen,\n      and it was springtime, with warm winds; Dundas came. It was like the\n      rushing of an eagle's flight. I met him one morning before the hunt set\n      out; he was twenty-five, and came from far lands; he walked by my side in\n      the garden, and when he touched me with his arm I began to love him. Two\n      red spots showed in his forehead, and I could have kissed those two red\n      spots.",

She could hardly look me in the face for\n      wonder. \"I love your youth and your good eyes,\" I said. \"Punish me to-day\n      because I have thought more of another than of you. I tell you, I have\n      come here only to see you; you make me happy, I am fond of you. Did you\n      hear me calling for you last night?\"",
                "\"No,\" she answered, frightened.",
                "\"I called Edwarda, but it was you I meant. I woke up and heard myself.\n      Yes, it was you I meant; it was only a mistake; I said 'Edwarda,' but it\n      was only by accident. By Heaven, you are my dearest, Eva! Your lips are so\n      red to-day. Your feet are prettier than Edwarda's -- just look yourself\n      and see.\"",
                "Joy such as I had never seen in her lit up her face; she made as if to\n      turn away, but hesitated, and put one arm round my neck.",

                "\"Would you believe it? Edwarda has not learnt to speak properly yet; she\n      talks like a child, and says 'more happier.' I heard her myself. Would you\n      say she had a lovely forehead? I do not think so. She has a devilish\n      forehead. And she does not wash her hands.\"",
                "\"But we weren't going to talk of her any more.\"",

                "\"Why are your eyes wet?\" asked Eva.",
                "\"She has a lovely forehead, though,\" I said, \"and her hands are always\n      clean. It was only an accident that they were dirty once. I did not mean\n      to say what I did.\" But then I went on angrily, with clenched teeth: \"I\n      sit thinking of you all the time, Eva; but it occurs to me that perhaps\n      you have not heard what I am going to tell you now. The first time Edwarda\n      saw \u00c3\u0086sop, she said: '\u00c3\u0086sop -- that was the name of a wise man -- a\n      Phrygian, he was.' Now wasn't that simply silly? She had read it in a book\n      the same day, I'm sure of it.\"",
                "\"Yes,\" says Eva; \"but what of it?\"",
                "\"And as far as I remember, she said, too, that \u00c3\u0086sop had Xanthus for his\n      teacher. Hahaha!\"",
                "\"Yes?\"",
                "\"Well, what the devil is the sense of telling a crowd of people that \u00c3\u0086sop\n      had Xanthus for his teacher? I ask you. Oh, you are not in the mood\n      to-day, Eva, or you would laugh till your sides ached at that.\"",
                "\"Yes, I think it is funny,\" said Eva, and began laughing forcedly and in\n      wonder. \"But I don't understand it as well as you do.\"",
                "I sit silent and thoughtful, silent and thoughtful.",
                "\"Do you like best to sit still and not talk?\" asked Eva softly. Goodness\n      shone in her eyes; she passed her hand over my hair.",
                "\"You good, good soul,\" I broke out, and pressed her close to me. \"I know\n      for certain I am perishing for love of you; I love you more and more; the\n      end of it will be that you must go with me when I go away. You shall see.\n      Could you go with me?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" she answered.",
                "I hardly heard that yes, but I felt it in her breath and all through her.\n      We held each other fiercely.",

                "Eva did not move.",
                "Herr Mack regained his composure; a curious confidence appeared in his\n      manner, and he answered:",
                "\"You are mistaken: I came on purpose to find you. I wish to point out to\n      you that from the 1st of April it is forbidden to fire a shot within half\n      a mile of the bird-cliffs. You shot two birds out at the island to-day;\n      you were seen doing so.\"",

                "\"Well, then, devil take it, you know what you have to do, I suppose?\"",
                "\"Perfectly well,\" he answered.",
                "Eva held herself in readiness; when I went out, she followed me; she had\n      put on a kerchief, and walked away from the house; I saw her going down\n      towards the quay. Herr Mack walked back home.",
                "I thought it over. What a mind, to hit on that all at once, and save\n      himself! And those piercing eyes of his. A shot, two shots, a brace of\n      guillemots -- a fine, a payment. And then everything, everything,\n      would be settled with Herr Mack and his house. After all, it was going off\n      so beautifully quickly and neatly...",
                "The rain was coming down already, in great soft drops. The magpies flew\n      low along the ground, and when I came home and turned \u00c3\u0086sop loose he began\n      eating the grass. The wind was beginning to rustle."

Far, far\n      out lies a hidden reef, and from that hidden reef rises a white merman,\n      shaking his head after a leaky sailboat making out to sea before the wind.\n      Hoho! out to sea, out to the desolate sea...",

                "\"Oh, you are tearing my heart out. I came to you to-day; I waited for you\n      here, and I smiled when you came. I was nearly out of my mind yesterday,\n      because of something I had been thinking of all the time; my head was in a\n      whirl, and I thought of you all the time. To-day I was sitting at home,\n      and someone came in; I did not look up, but I knew who it was. 'I rowed\n      half a mile to-day,' he said. 'Weren't you tired?' I asked. 'Oh yes, very\n      tired, and it blistered my hands,' he said, and was very concerned about\n      it. And I thought: Fancy being concerned about that! A little after he\n      said: 'I heard someone whispering outside my window last night; it was\n      your maid and one of the store men talking very intimately indeed.' 'Yes,\n      they are to be married,' I said. 'But this was at two o'clock in the\n      morning!' 'Well, what of it?' said I, and, after a little: 'The night is\n      their own.' Then he shifted his gold spectacles a little up his nose, and\n      observed: 'But don't you think, at that hour of night, it doesn't look\n      well?' Still I didn't look up, and we sat like that for ten minutes.\n      'Shall I bring you a shawl to put over your shoulders?' he asked. 'No,\n      thank you,' I answered. 'If only I dared take your little hand,' he said.\n      I did not answer -- I was thinking of something else. He laid a little\n      box in my lap. I opened the box, and found a brooch in it. There was a\n      coronet on the brooch, and I counted ten stones in it... Glahn, I have\n      that brooch with me now; will you look at it? It is trampled to bits -- come,\n      come and see how it is trampled to bits... 'Well, and what am I to do with\n      this brooch?' I asked. 'Wear it,' he answered. But I gave him back the\n      brooch, and said, 'Let me alone -- it is another I care for.' 'What\n      other?' he asked. 'A hunter in the woods,' I said. 'He gave me two lovely\n      feathers once, for a keepsake. Take back your brooch.' But he would not.\n      Then I looked at him for the first time; his eyes were piercing. 'I will\n      not take back the brooch. You may do with it as you please; tread on it,'\n      he said. I stood up and put the brooch under my heel and trod on it. That\n      was this morning... For four hours I waited and waited; after dinner I\n      went out. He came to meet me on the road. 'Where are you going?' he asked.\n      'To Glahn,' I answered, 'to ask him not to forget me...' Since one o'clock\n      I have been waiting here. I stood by a tree and saw you coming -- you\n      were like a god. I loved your figure, your beard, and your shoulders,\n      loved everything about you... Now you are impatient; you want to go, only\n      to go; I am nothing to you, you will not look at me ...\" I had stopped.\n      When she had finished speaking I began walking on again. I was worn out\n      with despair, and I smiled; my heart was hard.",
                "\"Yes?\" I said, and stopped again. \"You had something to say to me?\"",
                "But at this scorn of mine she wearied of me.",
                "\"Something to say to you? But I have told you -- did you not hear? No,\n      nothing -- I have nothing to tell you any more...\"",
                "Her voice trembled strangely, but that did not move me.",
                "Next morning Edwarda was standing outside the hut when I went out.",
                "I had thought it all over during the night, and taken my resolve. Why\n      should I let myself be dazzled any longer by this creature of moods, a\n      fisher-girl, a thing of no culture? Had not her name fastened for long\n      enough on my heart, sucking it dry? Enough of that! -- though it struck\n      me that, perhaps, I had come nearer to her by treating her with\n      indifference and scorn. Oh, how grandly I had scorned her -- after she\n      had made a long speech of several minutes, to say calmly: \"Yes? You had\n      something to say to me...?\"",
                "She was standing by the big stone. She was in great excitement, and would\n      have run towards me; her arms were already opened. But she stopped, and\n      stood there wringing her hands. I took off my cap and bowed to her without\n      a word.",
                "\"Just one thing I wanted to say to you to-day, Glahn,\" she said\n      entreatingly. And I did not move, but waited, just to hear what she would\n      say next. \"I hear you have been down at the blacksmith's. One evening it\n      was. Eva was alone in the house.\"",

When I got home all wet through last night, my father said: 'You\n      were rude to the Baron to-day.' 'No,' I answered. 'Where have you been\n      now?' he asked again. I answered: 'With Glahn.'",

She thought, perhaps, of her shoe that I had\n      thrown into the water, of the cups and glasses I had so unfortunately\n      managed to break, and of all the other breaches of good taste I had\n      committed; doubtless all those things flashed into her mind again. I was\n      ashamed. It was all over with me; whichever way I turned, I met frightened\n      and astonished looks.

                "To tell the truth, I am not surprised that his people should still keep on\n      seeking information; for Thomas Glahn was in many ways an uncommon and\n      likable man. I admit this, for fairness' sake, and despite the fact that\n      Glahn is still repellant to my soul, so that the bare memory of him\n      arouses hatred. He was a splendidly handsome man, full of youth, and with\n      an irresistible manner. When he looked at you with his hot animal eyes,\n      you could not but feel his power; even I felt it so. A woman, they say,\n      said: \"When he looks at me, I am lost; I feel a sensation as if he were\n      touching me.\"",

He could at times be full of nonsense like a\n      child, so kindly natured was he; and perhaps it was that which made him so\n      irresistible to women. God knows! He could chat with them and laugh at\n      their senseless twaddle; and so he made an impression. Once, speaking of a\n      very corpulent man in the place, he said that he looked as if he went\n      about with his breeches full of lard. And he laughed at that joke himself,\n      though I should have been ashamed of it. Another time, after we had come\n      to live in the same house together, he showed his foolishness in an\n      unmistakable way. My landlady came in one morning and asked what I would\n      have for breakfast, and in my hurry I happened to answer: \"A bread and a\n      slice of egg.\" Thomas Glahn was sitting in my room at the time -- he\n      lived in the attic up above, just under the roof -- and he began to\n      chuckle and laugh childishly over my little slip of the tongue. \"A bread\n      and a slice of egg!\" he repeated time over and over, until I looked at him\n      in surprise and made him stop.",

Why should I be generous? But I will admit that he talked nonsense\n      only when he was drunk. But is it not a great mistake to be drunk at all?",
                "When I first met him, in the autumn of 1859, he was a man of\n      two-and-thirty -- we were of an age. He wore a full beard at that time,\n      and affected woolen sports shirts with an exaggerated lowness of neck; not\n      content with that, he sometimes left the top button undone. His neck\n      appeared to me at first to be remarkably handsome; but little by little he\n      made me his deadly enemy, and then I did not consider his neck handsomer\n      than mine, though I did not show off mine so openly. I met him first on a\n      river boat, and we were going to the same place, on a hunting trip; we\n      agreed to go together up-country by ox-wagon when we came to the end of\n      the railway. I purposely refrained from stating the place we were going\n      to, not wishing to set anyone on the track. But the Glahns can safely stop\n      advertising for their relative; for he died at the place we went to, which\n      I will not name.",
                "I had heard of Thomas Glahn, by the way, before I met him; his name was\n      not unknown to me. I had heard of some affair of his with a young girl\n      from Nordland, from a big house there, and that he had compromised her in\n      some way, after which she broke it off. This he had sworn, in his foolish\n      obstinacy, to revenge upon himself, and the lady calmly let him do as he\n      pleased in that respect, considering it no business of hers. From that\n      time onwards, Thomas Glahn's name began to be well known; he turned wild,\n      mad; he drank, created scandal after scandal, and resigned his commission\n      in the army. A queer way of taking vengeance for a girl's refusal!",
                "There was also another story of his relations with that young lady, to the\n      effect that he had not compromised her in any way, but that her people had\n      showed him the door, and that she herself had helped in it, after a\n      Swedish Count, whose name I will not mention, had proposed to her. But\n      this account I am less inclined to trust; I regard the first as true, for\n      after all I hate Thomas Glahn and believe him capable of the worst. But,\n      however it may have been, he never spoke himself of the affair with that\n      noble lady, and I did not ask him about it. What business was it of mine?",
                "As we sat there on the boat, I remember we talked about the little village\n      we were making for, to which neither of us had been before.",
                "\"There's a sort of hotel there, I believe,\" said Glahn, looking at the\n      map. \"Kept by an old half-caste woman, so they say. The chief lives in the\n      next village, and has a heap of wives, by all accounts -- some of them\n      only ten years old.\"",
                "Well, I knew nothing about the chief and his wives, or whether there was a\n      hotel in the place, so I said nothing. But Glahn smiled, and I thought his\n      smile was beautiful.",
                "I forgot, by the way, that he could not by any means be called a perfect\n      man, handsome though he was. He told me himself that he had an old gunshot\n      wound in his left foot, and that it was full of gout whenever the weather\n      changed."

                "II",
                "A week later we were lodged in the big hut that went by the name of hotel,\n      with the old English half-caste woman. What a hotel it was! The walls were\n      of clay, with a little wood, and the wood was eaten through by the white\n      ants that crawled about everywhere. I lived in a room next the main\n      parlor, with a green glass window looking on to the street -- a single\n      pane, not very clear at that -- and Glahn had chosen a little bit of a\n      hole up in the attic, much darker, and a poor place to live in. The sun\n      heated the thatched roof and made his room almost insufferably hot at\n      night and day; besides which, it was not a stair at all that led up to it,\n      but a wretched bit of a ladder with four steps. What could I do? I let him\n      take his choice, and said:",
                "\"Here are two rooms, one upstairs and one down; take your choice.\"",
                "And Glahn looked at the two rooms and took the upper one, possibly to give\n      me the better of the two -- but was I not grateful for it? I owe him\n      nothing.",
                "As long as the worst of the heat lasted, we left the hunting alone and\n      stayed quietly in the hut, for the heat was extremely uncomfortable. We\n      lay at night with a mosquito net over the bedplace, to keep off the\n      insects; but even then it happened sometimes that blind bats would come\n      flying silently against our nets and tear them. This happened too often to\n      Glahn, because he was obliged to have a trap in the roof open all the\n      time, on account of the heat; but it did not happen to me. In the daytime\n      we lay on mats outside the hut, and smoked and watched the life about the\n      other huts. The natives were brown, thick-lipped folk, all with rings in\n      their ears and dead, brown eyes; they were almost naked, with just a strip\n      of cotton cloth or plaited leaves round the middle, and the women had also\n      a short petticoat of cotton stuff to cover them. All the children went\n      about stark naked night and day, with great big prominent bellies simply\n      glistening with oil.",
                "\"The women are too fat,\" said Glahn.",
                "And I too thought the women were too fat. Perhaps it was not Glahn at all,\n      but myself, who thought so first; but I will not dispute his claim -- I\n      am willing to give him the credit. As a matter of fact, not all the women\n      were ugly, though their faces were fat and swollen. I had met a girl in\n      the village, a young half-Tamil with long hair and snow-white teeth; she\n      was the prettiest of them all. I came upon her one evening at the edge of\n      a rice field. She lay flat on her face in the high grass, kicking her legs\n      in the air. She could talk to me, and we did talk, too, as long as I\n      pleased. Glahn sat that evening in the middle of our village outside a hut\n      with two other girls, very young -- not more than ten years old,\n      perhaps. He sat there talking nonsense to them, and drinking rice beer;\n      that was the sort of thing he liked.",
                "A couple of days later, we went out shooting. We passed by tea gardens,\n      rice fields, and grass plains; we left the village behind us and went in\n      the direction of the river, and came into forests of strange foreign\n      trees, bamboo and mango, tamarind, teak and salt trees, oil -- and\n      gum-bearing plants -- Heaven knows what they all were; we had, between\n      us, but little knowledge of the things. But there was very little water in\n      the river, and so it remained until the rainy season. We shot wild pigeons\n      and partridges, and saw a couple of panthers one afternoon; parrots, too,\n      flew over our heads. Glahn was a terribly accurate shot; he never missed.\n      But that was merely because his gun was better than mine; many times I too\n      shot terribly accurately. I never boasted of it, but Glahn would often\n      say: \"I'll get that fellow in the tail,\" or \"that one in the head.\" He\n      would say that before he fired; and when the bird fell, sure enough, it\n      was hit in the tail or the head as he had said. When we came upon the two\n      panthers, Glahn was all for attacking them too with his shot-gun, but I\n      persuaded him to give it up, as it was getting dusk, and we had no more\n      than two or three cartridges left. He boasted of that too -- of having\n      had the courage to attack panthers with a shot-gun.",
                "\"I am sorry I did not fire at them after all,\" he said to me. \"What do you\n      want to be so infernally cautious for? Do you want to go on living?\" \"I'm\n      glad you consider me wiser than yourself,\" I answered.",
                "\"Well, don't let us quarrel over a trifle,\" he said.",
                "Those were his words, not mine; if he had wished to quarrel, I for my part\n      had no wish to prevent him. I was beginning to feel some dislike for him\n      for his incautious behavior, and for his manner with women. Only the night\n      before, I had been walking quietly along with Maggie, the Tamil girl that\n      was my friend, and we were both as happy as could be. Glahn sits outside\n      his hut, and nods and smiles to us as we pass. It was then that Maggie saw\n      him for the first time, and she was very inquisitive about him. So great\n      an impression had he made on her that, when it was time to go, we went\n      each our own way; she did not go back home with me.",
                "Glahn would have put this by as of no importance when I spoke to him about\n      it. But I did not forget it. And it was not to me that he nodded and\n      smiled as we passed by the hut! it was to Maggie.",
                "\"What's that she chews?\" he asked me.",
                "\"I don't know,\" I answered. \"She chews -- I suppose that's what her\n      teeth are for.\"",
                "And it was no news to me either that Maggie was always chewing something;\n      I had noticed it long before. But it was not betel she was chewing, for\n      her teeth were quite white; she had, however, a habit of chewing all sorts\n      of other things -- putting them in her mouth and chewing as if they\n      were something nice. Anything would do -- a piece of money, a scrap of\n      paper, feathers -- she would chew it all the same. Still, it was\n      nothing to reproach her for, seeing that she was the prettiest girl in the\n      village, anyway. Glahn was jealous of me, that was all.",
                "I was friends again with Maggie, though, next evening, and we saw nothing\n      of Glahn."

                "A week passed, and we went out shooting every day, and shot a heap of\n      game. One morning, just as we were entering the forest, Glahn gripped me\n      by the arm and whispered: \"Stop!\" At the same moment he threw up his rifle\n      and fired. It was a young leopard he had shot, I might have fired myself,\n      but Glahn kept the honour to himself and fired first. Now he'll boast of\n      that later on, I said to myself. We went up to the dead beast. It was\n      stone dead, the left flank all torn up and the bullet in its back.",

                "I said: \"You think perhaps I couldn't have done it?\"",
                "Still Glahn made no answer. Instead, he showed his childishness once more,\n      shooting the dead leopard again, this time through the head. I looked at\n      him in utter astonishment.",
                "\"Well, you know,\" he explains, \"I shouldn't like to have it said that I\n      shot a leopard in the flank.\"",
                "\"You are very amiable this evening,\" I said.",
                "It was too much for his vanity to have made such a poor shot; he must\n      always be first. What a fool he was! But it was no business of mine,\n      anyway. I was not going to show him up.",
                "In the evening, when we came back to the village with the dead leopard, a\n      lot of the natives came out to look at it. Glahn simply said we had shot\n      it that morning, and made no sort of fuss about it himself at the time.\n      Maggie came up too.",
                "\"Who shot it?\" she asked.",
                "And Glahn answered:",
                "\"You can see for yourself -- twice hit. We shot it this morning when we\n      went out.\" And he turned the beast over and showed her the two bullet\n      wounds, both that in the flank and that in the head. \"That's where mine\n      went,\" he said, pointing to the side -- in his idiotic fashion he\n      wanted me to have the credit of having shot it in the head. I did not\n      trouble to correct him; I said nothing. After that, Glahn began treating\n      the natives with rice beer -- gave them any amount of it, as many as\n      cared to drink.",
                "\"Both shot it,\" said Maggie to herself; but she was looking at Glahn all\n      the time.",
                "I drew her aside with me and said:",
                "\"What are you looking at him all the time for? I am here too, I suppose?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" she said. \"And listen: I am coming this evening.\"",
                "It was the day after this that Glahn got the letter. There came a letter\n      for him, sent up by express messenger from the river station, and it had\n      made a detour of a hundred and eighty miles. The letter was in a woman's\n      hand, and I thought to my self that perhaps it was from that former friend\n      of his, the noble lady. Glahn laughed nervously when he had read it, and\n      gave the messenger extra money for bringing it. But it was not long before\n      he turned silent and gloomy, and did nothing but sit staring straight\n      before him. That evening he got drunk -- sat drinking with an old dwarf\n      of a native and his son, and clung hold of me too, and did all he could to\n      make me drink as well.",
                "Then he laughed out loud and said:",
                "\"Here we are, the two of us, miles away in the middle of all India\n      shooting game -- what? Desperately funny, isn't it? And hurrah for all\n      the lands and kingdoms of the earth, and hurrah for all the pretty women,\n      married or unmarried, far and near. Hoho! Nice thing for a man when a\n      married woman proposes to him, isn't it -- a married woman?\"",
                "\"A countess,\" I said ironically. I said it very scornfully, and that cut\n      him. He grinned like a dog because it hurt him. Then suddenly he wrinkled\n      his forehead and began blinking his eyes, and thinking hard if he hadn't\n      said too much -- so mighty serious was he about his bit of a secret.\n      But just then a lot of children came running over to our hut and crying\n      out: \"Tigers, ohoi, the tigers!\" A child had been snapped up by a tiger\n      quite close to the village, in a thicket between it and the river.",
                "That was enough for Glahn, drunk as he was, and cut up about something\n      into the bargain. He picked up his rifle and raced off at once to the\n      thicket -- didn't even put on his hat. But why did he take his rifle\n      instead of a shot-gun, if he was really as plucky as all that? He had to\n      wade across the river, and that was rather a risky thing in itself -- but\n      then, the river was nearly dry now, till the rains. A little later I heard\n      two shots, and then, close on them, a third. Three shots at a single\n      beast, I thought; why, a lion would have fallen for two, and this was only\n      a tiger! But even those three shots were no use: the child was torn to\n      bits and half eaten by the time Glahn come up. If he hadn't been drunk he\n      wouldn't have made the attempt to save it.",
                "He spent the night drinking and rioting in the hut next door. For two days\n      he was never sober for a minute, and he had found a lot of companions,\n      too, to drink with him. He begged me in vain to take part in the orgy. He\n      was no longer careful of what he said, and taunted me with being jealous\n      of him.",
                "\"Your jealousy makes you blind,\" he said.",
                "My jealousy? I, jealous of him?",
                "\"Good Lord!\" I said, \"I jealous of you? What's there for me to be jealous\n      about?\"",
                "\"No, no, of course you're not jealous of me,\" he answered. \"I saw Maggie\n      this evening, by the way. She was chewing something, as usual.\"",

About noon, Glahn began walking a bit\n      ahead of me, as if to give me a better chance of doing what I liked with\n      him.

His ill\n      temper carried him so far that he would not even answer the most friendly\n      questions when our landlady spoke to him; and he used to groan in his\n      sleep. He must have a deal on his conscience, I thought -- but why in\n      the name of goodness didn't he go home? Just pride, no doubt; he would not\n      go back when he had been turned off once.",
                "I met Maggie every evening, and Glahn talked with her no more. I noticed\n      that she had given up chewing things altogether; she never chewed now. I\n      was pleased at that, and thought: She's given up chewing things; that is\n      one failing the less, and I love her twice as much as I did before!",

                "\"I don't chew things now -- nothing at all. No feathers or money or\n      bits of paper -- you can see for yourself.\"",
                "Glahn scarcely looked at her. He lay still. Maggie and I went on. When I\n      reproached her with having broken her promise and spoken to Glahn again,\n      she answered that she had only meant to show him he was wrong.",
                "\"That's right -- show him he's wrong,\" I said. \"But do you mean it was\n      for his sake you stopped chewing things?\"",
                "She didn't answer. What, wouldn't she answer?",
                "\"Do you hear? Tell me, was it for his sake?\"",
                "And I could not think otherwise. Why should she do anything for Glahn's\n      sake?",
                "That evening Maggie promised to come to me, and she did."

                "She came at ten o'clock. I heard her voice outside; she was talking loud\n      to a child whom she led by the hand. Why did she not come in, and what had\n      she brought the child for? I watched her, and it struck me that she was\n      giving a signal by talking out loud to the child; I noticed, too, that she\n      kept her eyes fixed on the attic -- on Glahn's window up there. Had he\n      nodded to her, I wondered, or beckoned to her from inside when he heard\n      her talking outside? Anyhow, I had sense enough myself to know there was\n      no need to look up aloft when talking to a child on the ground.",
                "I was going out to take her by the arm. But just then she let go the\n      child's hand, left the child standing there, and came in herself, through\n      the door to the hut. She stepped into the passage. Well, there she was at\n      last; I would take care to give her a good talking to when she came!",
                "Well, I stood there and heard Maggie step into the passage. There was no\n      mistake: she was close outside my door. But instead of coming in to me, I\n      heard her step up the ladder -- up to the attic -- to Glahn's hole\n      up there. I heard it only too well. I threw my door open wide, but Maggie\n      had gone up already. That was ten o'clock.",
                "I went in, sat down in my room, and took my gun and loaded it. At twelve\n      o'clock I went up the ladder and listened at Glahn's door. I could hear\n      Maggie in there; I went down again. At one I went up again; all was quiet\n      this time. I waited outside the door. Three o'clock, four o'clock, five.\n      Good, I thought to myself. But a little after, I heard a noise and\n      movement below in the hut, in my landlady's room; and I had to go down\n      again quickly, so as not to let her find me there. I might have listened\n      much more, but I had to go.",
                "In the passage I said to myself: \"See, here she went: she must have\n      touched my door with her arm as she passed, but she did not open the door:\n      she went up the ladder, and here is the ladder itself -- those four\n      steps, she has trodden them.\"",
                "My bed still lay untouched, and I did not lie down now, but sat by the\n      window, fingering my rifle now and again. My heart was not beating -- it\n      was trembling.",
                "Half an hour later I heard Maggie's footstep on the ladder again. I lay\n      close up to the window and saw her walk out of the hut. She was wearing\n      her little short cotton petticoat, that did not even reach to her knees,\n      and over her shoulders a woolen scarf borrowed from Glahn. She walked\n      slowly, as she always did, and did not so much as glance towards my\n      window. Then she disappeared behind the huts.",
                "A little after came Glahn, with his rifle under his arm, all ready to go\n      out. He looked gloomy, and did not even say good-morning. I noticed,\n      though, that he had got himself up and taken special care about his dress.",
                "I got ready at once and went with him. Neither of us said a word. The\n      first two birds we shot were mangled horribly, through shooting them with\n      the rifle; but we cooked them under a tree as best we could, and ate in\n      silence. So the day wore on till noon.",
                "Glahn called out to me:",
                "\"Sure your gun is loaded? We might come across something unexpectedly.\n      Load it, anyhow.\"",
                "\"It is loaded,\" I answered.",
                "Then he disappeared a moment into the bush. I felt it would be a pleasure\n      to shoot him then -- pick him off and shoot him down like a dog. There\n      was no hurry; he could still enjoy the thought of it for a bit. He knew\n      well enough what I had in mind: that was why he had asked if my gun were\n      loaded. Even to-day he could not refrain from giving way to his beastly\n      pride. He had dressed himself up and put on a new shirt; his manner was,\n      lordly beyond all bounds.",
                "About one o'clock he stopped, pale and angry, in front of me, and said:",
                "\"I can't stand this! Look and see if you're loaded, man -- if you've\n      anything in your gun.\"",
                "\"Kindly look after your own gun,\" I answered. But I knew well enough why\n      he kept asking about mine.",
                "And he turned away again. My answer had so effectively put him in his\n      place that he actually seemed cowed: he even hung his head as he walked\n      off.",
                "After a while I shot a pigeon, and loaded again. While I was doing so, I\n      caught sight of Glahn standing half hidden behind a tree, watching me to\n      see if I really loaded. A little later he started singing a hymn -- and\n      a wedding hymn into the bargain. Singing wedding hymns, and putting on his\n      best clothes, I thought to myself -- that's his way of being extra\n      fascinating to-day. Even before he had finished the hymn he began walking\n      softly in front of me, hanging his head, and still singing as he walked.\n      He was keeping right in front of the muzzle of my gun again, as if\n      thinking to himself: Now it is coming, and that is why I am singing this\n      wedding hymn! But it did not come yet, and when he had finished his\n      singing he had to look back at me.",
                "\"We shan't get much to-day anyhow, by the look of it,\" he said, with a\n      smile, as if excusing himself, and asking pardon of me for singing while\n      we were out after game. But even at that moment his smile was beautiful.\n      It was as if he were weeping inwardly, and his lips trembled, too, for all\n      that he boasted of being able to smile at such a solemn moment.",
                "I was no woman, and he saw well enough that he made no impression on me.\n      He grew impatient, his face paled, he circled round me with hasty steps,\n      showing up now to the left, now to the right of me, and stopping every now\n      and then to wait for me to come up.",
                "About five, I heard a shot all of a sudden, and a bullet sang past my left\n      ear. I looked up. There was Glahn standing motionless a few paces off,\n      staring at me; his smoking rifle lay along his arm. Had he tried to shoot\n      me? I said:",
                "\"You missed that time. You've been shooting badly of late.\"",
                "But he had not been shooting badly. He never missed. He had only been\n      trying to irritate me.",
                "\"Then take your revenge, damn you!\" he shouted back.",
                "\"All in good time,\" I said, clenching my teeth.",
                "We stood there looking at each other. And suddenly Glahn shrugged his\n      shoulders and called out \"Coward\" to me. And why should he call me a\n      coward? I threw my rifle to my shoulder -- aimed full in his face -- fired.",
                "As a man soweth...",
                "Now, there is no need, I insist, for the Glahns to make further inquiry\n      about this man. It annoys me to be constantly seeing their advertisements\n      offering such and such reward for information about a dead man. Thomas\n      Glahn was killed by accident -- shot by accident when out on a hunting\n      trip in India. The court entered his name, with the particulars of his\n      end, in a register with pierced and threaded leaves. And in that register\n      it says that he is dead -- dead, I tell you -- and what is\n      more, that he was killed by accident.",
