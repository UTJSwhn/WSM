                "In spite of the success which was beginning to materialize outside\nFrance, the two friends found their financial position very slow in\nmending. Every now and then there recurred moments of penury when they\nwere obliged to go without food. They made up for it by eating twice as\nmuch as they needed when they had money. But, on the whole, it was a\ntrying existence.\n",
                "For the time being they were in the period of the lean kine. Christophe\nhad stayed up half the night to finish a dull piece of musical\ntranscription for Hecht: he did not get to bed until dawn, and slept\nlike a log to make up for lost time. Olivier had gone out early: he had\na lecture to give at the other end of Paris. About eight o'clock the\nporter came with the letters, and rang the bell. As a rule he did not\nwait for them to come, but just slipped the letters under the door. This\nmorning he went on knocking. Only half awake, Christophe went to the\ndoor growling: he paid no attention to what the smiling, loquacious\nporter was saying about an article in the paper, but just took the\nletters without looking at them, pushed the door to without closing it,\nwent to bed, and was soon fast asleep once more.\n",
                "An hour later he woke up with a start on hearing some one in his room:\nand he was amazed to see a strange face at the foot of his bed, a\ncomplete stranger bowing gravely to him. It was a journalist, who,\nfinding the door open, had entered without ceremony. Christophe was\nfurious, and jumped out of bed:\n",
                "\"What the devil are you doing here?\" he shouted.\n",
                "He grabbed his pillow to hurl it at the intruder, who skipped back. He\nexplained himself. A reporter of the Nation wished to interview M.\nKrafft about the article which had appeared in the _Grand Journal_.\n",
                "\"What article?\"\n",
                "\"Haven't you read it?\"\n",
                "The reporter began to tell him what it was about.\n",
                "Christophe went to bed again. If he had not been so sleepy he would have\nkicked the fellow out: but it was less trouble to let him talk. He\ncurled himself up in the bed, closed his eyes, and pretended to be\nasleep. And very soon he would really have been off, but the reporter\nstuck to his guns, and in a loud voice read the beginning of the\narticle. At the very first words Christophe pricked up his ears. M.\nKrafft was referred to as the greatest musical genius of the age.\nChristophe forgot that he was pretending to be asleep, swore in\nastonishment, sat up in bed, and said:\n",
                "\"They are mad! Who has been pulling their legs?\"\n",
                "The reporter seized the opportunity, and stopped reading to ply\nChristophe with a series of questions, which he answered unthinkingly.\nHe had picked up the paper, and was gazing in utter amazement at his own\nportrait, which was printed as large as life on the front page: but he\nhad no time to read the article, for another journalist entered the\nroom. This time Christophe was really angry. He told them to get out:\nbut they did not comply until they had made hurried notes of the\nfurniture in the room, and the photographs on the wall, and the features\nof the strange being who, between laughter and anger, thrust them out of\nthe room, and, in his nightgown, took them to the door and bolted it\nafter them.\n",
                "But it was ordained that he should not be left in peace that day. He had\nnot finished dressing when there came another knock at the door, a\nprearranged knock which was only known to a few of their friends.\nChristophe opened the door, and found himself face to face with yet\nanother stranger, whom he was just about to dismiss in a summary\nfashion, when the man protested that he was the author of the\narticle.... How are you to get rid of a man who regards you as a genius!\nChristophe had grumpily to submit to his admirer's effusions. He was\namazed at the sudden notoriety which had come like a bolt from the blue,\nand he wondered if, without knowing it, he had had a masterpiece\nproduced the evening before. But he had no time to find out. The\njournalist had come to drag him, whether he liked it or not, there and\nthen, to the offices of the paper where the editor, the great Ars\u00e8ne\nGamache himself, wished to see him: the car was waiting downstairs.\nChristophe tried to get out of it: but, in spite of himself, he was so\nna\u00efvely responsive to the journalist's friendly protestations that in\nthe end he gave way.\n",
                "Ten minutes later he was introduced to a potentate in whose presence all\nmen trembled. He was a sturdy little man, about fifty, short and stout,\nwith a big round head, gray hair brushed up, a red face, a masterful way\nof speaking, a thick, affected accent, and every now and then he would\nbreak out into a choppy sort of volubility. He had forced himself on\nParis by his enormous self-confidence. A business man, with a knowledge\nof men, na\u00efve and deep, passionate, full of himself, he identified his\nbusiness with the business of France, and even with the affairs of\nhumanity. His own interests, the prosperity of his paper, and the\n_salus publica_, all seemed to him to be of equal importance and to\nbe narrowly associated. He had no doubt that any man who wronged him,\nwronged France also: and to crush an adversary, he would in perfectly\ngood faith have overthrown the Government. However, he was by no means\nincapable of generosity. He was an idealist of the after-dinner order,\nand loved to be a sort of God Almighty, and to lift some poor devil or\nother out of the mire, by way of demonstrating the greatness of his\npower, whereby he could make something out of nothing, make and unmake\nMinisters, and, if he had cared to, make and unmake Kings. His sphere\nwas the universe. He would make men of genius, too, if it so pleased\nhim.\n",
                "That day he had just \"made\" Christophe.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "It was Olivier who in all innocence had belled the cat.\n",
                "Olivier, who could do nothing to advance his own interests, and had a\nhorror of notoriety, and avoided journalists like the plague, took quite\nanother view of these things where his friend was in question. He was\nlike those loving mothers, the right-living women of the middle-class,\nthose irreproachable wives, who would sell themselves to procure any\nadvantage for their rascally young sons.\n",
                "Writing for the reviews, and finding himself in touch with a number of\ncritics and dilettanti, Olivier never let slip an opportunity of talking\nabout Christophe: and for some time past he had been surprised to find\nthat they listened to him. He could feel a sort of current of curiosity,\na mysterious rumor flying about literary and polite circles. What was\nits origin? Were there echoes of newspaper opinion, following on the\nrecent performances of Christophe's work in England and Germany? It\nseemed impossible to trace it to any definite source. It was one of\nthose frequent phenomena of those men who sniff the air of Paris, and\ncan tell the day before, more exactly than the meteorological\nobservatory of the tower of Saint-Jacques, what wind is blowing up for\nthe morrow, and what it will bring with it. In that great city of\nnerves, through which electric vibrations pass, there are invisible\ncurrents of fame, a latent celebrity which precedes the actuality, the\nvague gossip of the drawing-rooms, the _nescio quid majus nascitur\nIliade_, which, at a given moment, bursts out in a puffing article,\nthe blare of the trumpet which drives the name of the new idol into the\nthickest heads. Sometimes that trumpet-blast alienates the first and\nbest friends of the man whose glory it proclaims. And yet they are\nresponsible for it.\n",
                "So Olivier had a share in the article in the _Grand Journal_. He\nhad taken advantage of the interest displayed in Christophe, and had\ncarefully stoked it up with adroitly worded information. He had been\ncareful not to bring Christophe directly into touch with the\njournalists, for he was afraid of an outburst. But at the request of the\n_Grand Journal_ he had slyly introduced Christophe to a reporter in\na caf\u00e9 without his having any suspicion. All these precautions only\npricked curiosity, and made Christophe more interesting. Olivier had\nnever had anything to do with publicity before: he had not stopped to\nconsider that he was setting in motion a machine which, once it got\ngoing, it was impossible to direct or control.\n",
                "He was in despair when, on his way to his lecture, he read the article\nin the _Grand Journal_. He had not foreseen such a calamity. Above\nall, he had not expected it to come so soon. He had reckoned on the\npaper waiting to make sure and verify its facts before it published\nanything. He was too na\u00efve. If a newspaper takes the trouble to discover\na new celebrity, it is, of course, for its own sake, so that its rivals\nmay not have the honor of the discovery. It must lose no time, even if\nit means knowing nothing whatever about the person in question. But an\nauthor very rarely complains: if he is admired, he has quite as much\nunderstanding as he wants.\n",
                "The _Grand Journal_, after setting out a few ridiculous stories\nabout Christophe's struggles, representing him as a victim of German\ndespotism, an apostle of liberty, forced to fly from Imperial Germany\nand take refuge in France, the home and shelter of free men,--(a fine\npretext for a Chauvinesque tirade!)--plunged into lumbering praise of\nhis genius, of which it knew nothing,--nothing except a few tame\nmelodies, dating from Christophe's early days in Germany, which\nChristophe, who was ashamed of them, would have liked to have seen\ndestroyed. But if the author of the article knew nothing at all about\nChristophe's work, he made up for it in his knowledge of his plans--or\nrather such plans as he invented for him. A few words let fall by\nChristophe or Olivier, or even by Goujart, who pretended to be\nwell-informed, had been enough for him to construct a fanciful\nJean-Christophe, \"a Republican genius,--the great musician of\ndemocracy.\" He seized the opportunity to decry various contemporary\nFrench musicians, especially the most original and independent among\nthem, who set very little store by democracy. He only excepted one or\ntwo composers, whose electoral opinions were excellent in his eyes. It\nwas annoying that their music was not better. But that was a detail. And\nbesides, his eulogy of these men, and even his praise of Christophe, was\nof not nearly so much account as his criticism of the rest. In Paris,\nwhen you read an article eulogizing a man's work, it is always as well\nto ask yourself:\n",
                "\"Whom is he decrying?\"\n",
                "Olivier went hot with shame as he read the paper, and said to himself:\n",
                "\"A fine thing I've done!\"\n",
                "He could hardly get through his lecture. As soon as he had finished he\nhurried home. What was his consternation to find that Christophe had\nalready gone out with the journalists! He delayed lunch for him.\nChristophe did not return. Hours passed, and Olivier grew more and more\nanxious and thought:\n",
                "\"What a lot of foolish things they will make him say!\"\n",
                "About three o'clock Christophe came home quite lively. He had had lunch\nwith Ars\u00e8ne Gamache, and his head was a little muzzy with the champagne\nhe had drunk. He could not understand Olivier's anxiety, who asked him\nin fear and trembling what he had said and done.\n",
                "\"What have I been doing? I've had a splendid lunch. I haven't had such a\ngood feed for a long time.\"\n",
                "He began to recount the menu.\n",
                "\"And wine.... I had wine of every color.\"\n",
                "Olivier interrupted him to ask who was there.\n",
                "\"Who was there?... I don't know. There was Gamache, a little round man,\ntrue as gold: Clodomir, the writer of the article, a charming fellow:\nthree or four journalists whom I didn't know, very jolly, all very nice\nand charming to me--the cream of good fellows.\"\n",
                "Olivier did not seem to be convinced. Christophe was astonished at his\nsmall enthusiasm.\n",
                "\"Haven't you read the article?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. I have. Have you read it?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.... That is to say, I just glanced at it. I haven't had time.\"\n",
                "\"Well: read it.\"\n",
                "Christophe took it up. At the first words he spluttered.\n",
                "\"Oh! The idiot!\" he said.\n",
                "He roared with laughter.\n",
                "\"Bah!\" he went on. \"These critics are all alike. They know nothing at\nall about it.\"\n",
                "But as he read farther he began to lose his temper: it was too stupid,\nit made him look ridiculous. What did they mean by calling him \"a\nRepublican musician\"; it did not mean anything.... Well, let the fib\npass.... But when they set his \"Republican\" art against the \"sacristy\nart\" of the masters who had preceded him,--(he whose soul was nourished\nby the souls of those great men),--it was too much....\n",
                "\"The swine! They're trying to make me out an idiot!...\"\n",
                "And then, what was the sense of using him as a cudgel to thwack talented\nFrench musicians, whom he loved more or less,--(though rather less than\nmore),--though they knew their trade, and honored it? And--worst of\nall--with an incredible want of tact he was credited with odious\nsentiments about his country!... No, that, that was beyond\nendurance....\n",
                "\"I shall write and tell them so,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "Olivier intervened.\n",
                "\"No, no,\" he said, \"not now! You are too excited. Tomorrow, when you are\ncooler....\"\n",
                "Christophe stuck to it. When he had anything to say he could not wait\nuntil the morrow. He promised Olivier to show him his letter. The\nprecaution was useful. The letter was duly revised, so as to be confined\npractically to the rectification of the opinions about Germany with\nwhich he had been credited, and then Christophe ran and posted it.\n",
                "\"Well,\" he said, when he returned, \"that will save half the harm being\ndone: the letter will appear to-morrow.\"\n",
                "Olivier shook his head doubtfully. He was still thoughtful, and he\nlooked Christophe straight in the face, and said:\n",
                "\"Christophe, did you say anything imprudent at lunch?\"\n",
                "\"Oh no,\" said Christophe with a laugh.\n",
                "\"Sure?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, you coward.\"\n",
                "Olivier was somewhat reassured. But Christophe was not. He had just\nremembered that he had talked volubly and unguardedly. He had been quite\nat his ease at once. It had never for a moment occurred to him to\ndistrust any of them: they seemed so cordial, so well-disposed towards\nhim! As, in fact, they were. We are always well-disposed to people when\nwe have done them a good turn, and Christophe was so frankly delighted\nwith it all that his joy infected them. His affectionate easy manners,\nhis jovial sallies, his enormous appetite, and the celerity with which\nthe various liquors vanished down his throat without making him turn a\nhair, were by no means displeasing to Ars\u00e8ne Gamache, who was himself a\nsturdy trencherman, coarse, boorish, and sanguine, and very contemptuous\nof people who had ill-health, and those who dared not eat and drink, and\nall the sickly Parisians. He judged a man by his prowess at table. He\nappreciated Christophe. There and then he proposed to produce his\n_Gargantua_ as an opera at the Op\u00e9ra.--(The very summit of art was reached\nfor these bourgeois French people in the production on the stage\nof the _Damnation of Faust_, or the _Nine Symphonies_.)--Christophe, who\nburst out laughing at the grotesqueness of the idea, had great difficulty\nin preventing him from telephoning his orders to the directors of the\nOp\u00e9ra, or the Minister of Fine Arts.--(If Gamache were to be believed, all\nthese important people were apparently at his beck and call.)--And, the\nproposal reminding him of the strange transmutation which had taken place\nin his symphonic poem, _David_, he went so far as to tell the story of the\nperformance organized by Deputy Roussin to introduce his mistress to the\npublic. Gamache, who did not like Roussin, was delighted: and Christophe,\nspurred on by the generous wines and the sympathy of his hearers, plunged\ninto other stories, more or less indiscreet, the point of which was not\nlost on those present. Christophe was the only one to forget them when the\nparty broke up. And now, on Olivier's question, they rushed back to his\nmemory. He felt a little shiver run down his spine. For he did not deceive\nhimself: he had enough experience to know what would happen: now that he\nwas sober again he saw it as clearly as though it had actually happened:\nhis indiscretions would be twisted and distorted, and scattered broadcast\nas malicious blabbing, his artistic sallies would be turned into weapons\nof war. As for his letter correcting the article, he knew as well as\nOlivier how much that would avail him: it is a waste of ink to answer a\njournalist, for he always has the last word.\n",
                "Everything happened exactly to the letter as Christophe had foreseen it\nwould. His indiscretions were published, his letter was not. Gamache\nonly went so far as to write to him that he recognized the generosity of\nhis feelings, and that his scruples were an honor to him: but he kept\nhis scruples dark: and the falsified opinions attributed to Christophe\nwent on being circulated, provoking biting criticism in the Parisian\npapers, and later in Germany, where much indignation was felt that a\nGerman artist should express himself with so little dignity about his\ncountry.\n",
                "Christophe thought he would be clever, and take advantage of an\ninterview by the reporter of another paper to protest his love for the\n_Deutsches Reich_, where, he said, people were at least as free as\nin the French Republic.--He was speaking to the representative of a\nConservative paper, who at once credited him with anti-Republican views.\n",
                "\"Better and better!\" said Christophe. \"But what on earth has my music to\ndo with politics?\"\n",
                "\"It is usual with us,\" said Olivier. \"Look at the battles that have\ntaken place over Beethoven. Some people will have it that he was a\nJacobin, others a mountebank, others still a P\u00e8re Duchesne, and others a\nprince's lackey.\"\n",
                "\"He'd knock their heads together.\"\n",
                "\"Well, do the same.\"\n",
                "Christophe only wished he could. But he was too amiable with people who\nwere friendly towards him. Olivier never felt happy when he left him\nalone. For they were always coming to interview him: and it was no use\nChristophe promising to be guarded: he could not help being confidential\nand unreserved. He said everything that came into his head. Women\njournalists would come and make a fuss of him, and get him to talk about\nhis sentimental adventures. Others would make use of him to speak ill of\nsuch-an-one, or so-and-so. When Olivier came in he would find Christophe\nutterly downcast.\n",
                "\"Another howler?\" he would ask.\n",
                "\"Of course,\" Christophe would reply in despair.\n",
                "\"You are incorrigible!\"\n",
                "\"I ought to be locked up.... But I swear that it is the last time.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I know. Until the next....\"\n",
                "\"No. This really is the last.\"\n",
                "Next day Christophe said triumphantly to Olivier:\n",
                "\"Another one came to-day. I shut the door in his face.\"\n",
                "\"Don't go too far,\" said Olivier. \"Be careful with them. 'This animal is\ndangerous.' He will attack you if you defend yourself.... It is so easy\nfor them to avenge themselves! They can twist the least little thing you\nmay have said to their uses.\"\n",
                "Christophe drew his hand across his forehead:\n",
                "\"Oh! Good Lord!\"\n",
                "\"What's the matter?\"\n",
                "\"When I shut the door in his face I told....\"\n",
                "\"What?\"\n",
                "\"The Emperor's joke.\"\n",
                "\"The Emperor's?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. His or one of his people's....\"\n",
                "\"How awful! You'll see it to-morrow on the front page!\"\n",
                "Christophe shuddered. But, next day, what he saw was a description of\nhis room, which the journalist had not seen, and a report of a\nconversation which he had not had with him.\n",
                "The facts were more and more embellished the farther they spread. In the\nforeign papers they were garnished out of all recognition. Certain\nFrench articles having told how in his poverty he had transposed music\nfor the guitar, Christophe learned from an English newspaper that he had\nplayed the guitar in the streets. He did not only read eulogies. Far\nfrom it. It was enough for Christophe to have been taken up by the\n_Grand Journal_, for him to be taken to task by the other papers.\nThey could not as a matter of dignity allow the possibility of a rival's\ndiscovering a genius whom they had ignored. Some of them were rabid\nabout it. Others commiserated Christophe on his ill-luck. Goujart,\nannoyed at having the ground cut away from under his feet, wrote an\narticle, as he said, to set people right on certain points. He wrote\nfamiliarly of his old friend Christophe, to whom, when he first came to\nParis, he had been guide and comforter: he was certainly a highly gifted\nmusician, but--(he was at liberty to say so, since they were\nfriends)--very deficient in many ways, ill-educated, unoriginal, and\ninordinately vain; so absurdly to flatter his vanity, as had been done,\nwas to serve him but ill at a time when he stood in need of a mentor who\nshould be wise, learned, judicious, benevolent, and severe, etc.--(a\nfancy portrait of Goujart).--The musicians made bitter fun of it all.\nThey affected a lofty contempt for an artist who had the newspapers at\nhis back: and, pretending to be disgusted with the _vulgum pecus_,\nthey refused the presents of Artaxerxes, which were not offered them.\nSome of them abused Christophe: others overwhelmed him with their\ncommiseration. Some of them--(his colleagues)--laid the blame on\nOlivier.--They were only too glad to pay him out for his intolerance and\nhis way of holding aloof from them,--rather, if the truth were known,\nfrom a desire for solitude than from scorn of any of them. But men are\nleast apt to pardon those who show that they can do without them.--Some\nof them almost went so far as to hint that he had made money by the\narticles in the _Grand Journal_. There were others who took upon\nthemselves to defend Christophe against him: they appeared to be\nbroken-hearted at Olivier's callousness in dragging a sensitive artist,\na dreamer, ill-equipped for the battle of life,--Christophe,--into the\nturmoil of the market-place, where he could not but be ruined: for they\nregarded Christophe as a little boy not strong enough in the head to be\nallowed to go out alone. The future of this man, they said, was being\nruined, for, even if he were not a genius, such good intentions and such\ntremendous industry deserved a better fate, and he was being intoxicated\nwith incense of an inferior brand. It was a great pity. Why could they\nnot leave him in his obscurity to go on working patiently for years?\n",
                "Olivier might have had the answer pat:\n",
                "\"A man must eat to work. Who will give him his bread?\"\n",
                "But that would not have abashed them. They would have replied with their\nmagnificent serenity:\n",
                "\"That is a detail. An artist must suffer. And what does a little\nsuffering matter?\"\n",
                "Of course, they were men of the world, quite well off, who professed\nthese Stoic theories. As the millionaire once said to the simple person\nwho came and asked him to help a poverty-stricken artist:\n",
                "\"But, sir, Mozart died of poverty.\"\n",
                "They would have thought it very bad taste on Olivier's part if he had\ntold them that Mozart would have asked nothing better than to go on\nliving, and that Christophe was determined to do so.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Christophe was getting heartily sick of the vulgar tittle-tattle. He\nbegan to wonder if it were going on forever.--But it was all over in a\nfortnight. The newspapers gave up talking about him. However, he had\nbecome known. When his name was mentioned, people said, not:\n",
                "\"The author of _David_ or _Gargantua_,\" but:\n",
                "\"Oh yes! The _Grand Journal_ man!...\"\n",
                "He was famous.\n",
                "Olivier knew it by the number of letters that came for Christophe, and\neven for himself, in his reflected glory: offers from librettists,\nproposals from concert-agents, declarations of friendship from men who\nhad formerly been his enemies, invitations from women. His opinion was\nasked, for newspaper inquiries, about anything and everything: the\ndepopulation of France, idealist art, women's corsets, the nude on the\nstage,--and did he believe that Germany was decadent, or that music had\nreached its end, etc., etc. They used to laugh at them all. But, though\nhe laughed, lo and behold! Christophe, that Huron, steadily accepted the\ninvitations to dinner! Olivier could not believe his eyes.\n",
                "\"You?\" he said.\n",
                "\"I! Certainly,\" replied Christophe jeeringly. \"You thought you were the\nonly man who could go and see the beautiful ladies? Not at all, my boy!\nIt's my turn now. I want to amuse myself!\"\n",
                "\"You? Amuse yourself? My dear old man!\"\n",
                "The truth was that Christophe had for so long lived shut up in his own\nroom that he felt a sudden longing to get away from it. Besides, he took\na na\u00efve delight in tasting his new fame. He was terribly bored at\nparties, and thought the people idiotic. But when he came home he used\nto take a malicious pleasure in telling Olivier how much he had enjoyed\nhimself. He would go to people's houses once, but never again: he would\ninvent the wildest excuses, with a frightful want of tact, to get out of\ntheir renewed invitations. Olivier would be scandalized, and Christophe\nwould shout with laughter. He did not go to their houses to spread his\nfame, but to replenish his store of life, his collection of expressions\nand tones of voice--all the material of form, and sound, and color, with\nwhich an artist has periodically to enrich his palette. A musician does\nnot feed only on music. An inflection of the human voice, the rhythm of\na gesture, the harmony of a smile, contain more suggestion of music for\nhim that another man's symphony. But it must be said that the music of\nfaces and human souls is as stale and lacking in variety in polite\nsociety as the music of polite musicians. Each has a manner and becomes\nset in it. The smile of a pretty woman is as stereotyped in its studied\ngrace as a Parisian melody. The men are even more insipid than the\nwomen. Under the debilitating influence of society, their energy is\nblunted, their original characters rot away and finally disappear with a\nfrightful rapidity. Christophe was struck by the number of dead and\ndying men he met among the artists: there was one young musician, full\nof life and genius, whom success had dulled, stupefied, and wiped out of\nexistence: he thought of nothing but swallowing down the flattery in\nwhich he was smothered, enjoying himself, and sleeping. What he would be\nlike twenty years later was shown in another corner of the room, in the\nperson of an old pomaded _maestro_, who was rich, famous, a member\nof all the Academies, at the very height of his career, and, though\napparently he had nothing to fear and no more wires to pull, groveled\nbefore everything and everybody, and was fearful of opinion, power, and\nthe Press, dared not say what he thought, and thought nothing at all--a\nman who had ceased to exist, showing himself off, an ass saddled with\nthe relics of his own past life.\n",
                "Behind all these artists and men of intellect who had been great, or\nmight have been great, there was certain to be some woman preying upon\nthem. They were all dangerous, both the fools and those who were by no\nmeans fools: both those who loved and those who loved themselves: the\nbest of them were the worst: for they were all the more certain to snuff\nout the artist with their immoderate affection, which made them in all\ngood faith try to domesticate genius, turn it to their own uses, drag it\ndown, prune it, pare it down, scent it, until they had brought it into\nline with their sensibility, their petty vanity, their mediocrity, and\nthe mediocrity of the world they lived in.\n",
                "Although Christophe only passed through that section of society, he saw\nenough of it to feel its danger. More than one woman, of course, tried\nto take possession of him for her circle, to press him into her service:\nand, of course, Christophe nibbled at the hook baited with friendly\nwords and alluring smiles. But for his sturdy common sense and the\ndisquieting spectacle of the transformations already effected in the men\nabout them by these modern Circes, he would not have escaped\nuncontaminated. But he had no mind to swell the herd of these lovely\ngoose-girls. The danger would have been greater for him if there had not\nbeen so many of them angling for him. Now that everybody, men and women,\nwere properly convinced that they had a genius in their midst, as usual,\nthey set to work to stifle him. Such people, when they see a flower,\nhave only one idea: to put it in a pot,--a bird: to put it in a cage,--\na free man: to turn him into a smooth lackey.\n",
                "Christophe was shaken for a moment, pulled himself together, and sent\nthem all packing.\n",
                "Fate is ironical. Those who do not care slip through the meshes of the\nnet: but those who are suspicious, those who are prudent, and\nforewarned, are never suffered to escape. It was not Christophe who was\ncaught in the net of Paris, but Olivier.\n",
                "He had benefited by his friend's success: Christophe's fame had given\nhim a reflected glory. He was better known now, for having been\nmentioned in a few papers as the man who had discovered Christophe, than\nfor anything he had written during the last six years. He was included\nin many of the invitations that came for Christophe: and he went with\nhim, meaning carefully and discreetly to look after him. No doubt he was\ntoo much absorbed in doing so to look after himself. Love passed by and\ncaught him.\n",
                "She was a little fair girl, charmingly slender, with soft hair waving in\nlittle ripples about her pure narrow forehead: she had fine eyebrows and\nrather heavy eyelids, eyes of a periwinkle blue, a delicately carved\nnose with sensitive nostrils; her temples were slightly hollowed: she\nhad a capricious chin, and a mobile, witty, and rather sensual mouth,\nturning up at the corners, and the _Parmigianninesque_ smile of a\npure faun. She had a long, delicate throat, a pretty waist, a slender,\nelegant figure, and a happy, pensive expression in her girlish face, in\nevery line of which there was the disturbing poetic mystery of the\nwaking spring,--_Fr\u00fchlingserwachen_. Her name was Jacqueline Langeais.\n",
                "She was not twenty. She came of a rich Catholic family, of great\ndistinction and broad-mindedness. Her father was a clever engineer, a\nman of some invention, clear-headed and open to new ideas, who had made\na fortune, thanks to his own hard work, his political connections, and\nhis marriage. He had married both for love and money--(the proper\nmarriage for love for such people)--a pretty woman, very Parisian, who\nwas bred in the world of finance. The money had stayed: but love had\ngone. However, he had managed to preserve a few sparks of it, for it had\nbeen very ardent on both sides: but they did not stickle for any\nexaggerated notion of fidelity. They went their ways and had their\npleasures: and they got on very well together, as friends, selfishly,\nunscrupulously, warily.\n",
                "Their daughter was a bond between them, though she was the object of an\nunspoken rivalry between them: for they both loved her jealously. They\nboth saw themselves in her with their pet faults idealized by the grace\nof childhood: and each strove cunningly to steal her from the other. And\nthe child had in due course become conscious of it, with the artful\ncandor of such little creatures, who are only too ready to believe that\nthe universe gravitates round themselves: and she turned it to good\naccount. She had them perpetually outbidding each other for her\naffection. She never had a whim but she was sure that one of them would\nindulge it if the other refused: and the other would be so vexed at\nbeing outdone that she would at once be offered an even greater\nindulgence than the first. She had been dreadfully spoiled: and it was\nvery fortunate for her that there was no evil in her nature,--outside\nthe egoism common to almost all children, though in children who are too\nrich and too much pampered it assumes various morbid shapes, due to the\nabsence of difficulties and the want of any goal to aim at.\n",
                "Though they adored her, neither M. nor Madame Langeais ever thought of\nsacrificing their own personal convenience to her. They used to leave\nthe child alone, for the greater part of the day, to gratify her\nthousand and one fancies. She had plenty of time for dreaming, and she\nwasted none of it. She was precocious and quick to grasp at incautious\nremarks let fall in her presence--(for her parents were never very\nguarded in what they said),--and when she was six years old she used to\ntell her dolls love-stories, the characters in which were husband, wife,\nand lover. It goes without saying that she saw no harm in it. Directly\nshe began to perceive a shade of feeling underlying the words it was all\nover for the dolls: she kept her stories to herself. There was in her a\nstrain of innocent sensuality, which rang out in the distance like the\nsound of invisible bells, over there, over there, on the other side of\nthe horizon. She did not know what it was. Sometimes it would come\nwafted on the wind: it came she did not know from whence, and wrapped\nher round and made the blood mount to her cheeks, and she would lose her\nbreath in the fear and pleasure of it. She could not understand it. And\nthen it would disappear as strangely as it had come. There was never\nanother sound. Hardly more than a faint buzzing, an imperceptible\nresonance, fainter and fainter, in the blue air. Only she knew that it\nwas yonder, on the other side of the mountain, and thither she must go,\ngo as soon as possible: for there lay happiness. Ah! If only she could\nreach it!...\n",
                "In the meanwhile, until she should reach that land of happiness, she\nwove strange dreams of what she would find there. For the chief\noccupation of the child's mind was guessing at its nature. She had a\nfriend of her own age, Simone Adam, with whom she used often to discuss\nthese great subjects. Each brought to bear on them the light of her\ntwelve years' experience, conversations overheard and stolen reading. On\ntip-toe, clinging to the crannies in the stones, the two little girls\nstrained to peer over the old wall which hid the future from them. But\nit was all in vain, and it was idle for them to pretend that they could\nsee through the chinks: they could see nothing at all. They were both a\nmixture of innocence, poetic salaciousness, and Parisian irony. They\nused to say the most outrageous things without knowing it, and they were\nalways making mountains out of molehills. Jacqueline, who was always\nprying, without anybody to find fault with her, used to burrow in all\nher father's books. Fortunately, she was protected from coming to any\nharm by her very innocence and her own young, healthy instincts: an\nunduly described scene or a coarse word disgusted her at once: she would\ndrop the book at once, and she passed through the most infamous company,\nlike a frightened cat through puddles of dirty water,--without so much\nas a splash.\n",
                "As a rule, novels did not attract her: they were too precise, too dry.\nBut books of poetry used to make her heart flutter with emotion and hope\nof finding the key to the riddle,--love-poems, of course. They coincided\nto a certain extent with her childish outlook on things. The poets did\nnot see things as they were, they imagined them through the prism of\ndesire or regret: they seemed, like herself, to be peering through the\nchinks of the old wall. But they knew much more, they knew all the\nthings which she was longing to know, and clothed them with sweet,\nmysterious words, which she had to unravel with infinite care to find\n... to find ... Ah! She could find nothing, but she was always sure that\nshe was on the very brink of finding it....\n",
                "Their curiosity was indomitable. They would thrill as they whispered\nverses of Alfred de Musset and Sully Prudhomme, into which they read\nabyss on abyss of perversity: they used to copy them out, and ask each\nother about the hidden meanings of passages, which generally contained\nnone. These little women of thirteen, who knew nothing of love, used, in\ntheir innocent effrontery, to discuss, half in jest, half in earnest,\nlove and the sweets of love: and, in school, under the fatherly eye of\nthe master--a very polite and mild old gentleman--verses like the\nfollowing, which he confiscated one day, when they made him gasp:\n",
                "  \"Let, oh! let me clasp you in my arms,\n   And in your kisses drink insensate love\n   Drop by drop in one long draught....\"\n",
                "They attended lectures at a fashionable and very prosperous school, the\nteachers of which were Masters of Art of the University. There they\nfound material for their sentimental aspirations. Almost all the girls\nwere in love with their masters. If they were young and not too ugly,\nthat was quite enough for them to make havoc of their pupils'\nhearts--who would work like angels to please their sultan. And they\nwould weep when he gave them bad marks in their examinations: though\nthey did not care when anybody else did the same. If he praised them,\nthey would blush and go pale by turns, and gaze at him coquettishly in\ngratitude. And if he called them aside to give them advice or pay them a\ncompliment, they were in Paradise. There was no need for him to be an\neagle to win their favor. When the gymnastic instructor took Jacqueline\nin his arms to lift her up to the trapeze, she would be in ecstasies.\nAnd what furious emulation there was between them! How coaxingly and\nwith what humility they would make eyes at the master to attract his\nattention from a presumptuous rival! At lectures, when he opened his\nlips to speak, pens and pencils would be hastily produced to take down\nwhat he said. They made no attempt to understand: the chief thing was\nnot to lose a syllable. And while they went on writing and writing\nwithout ceasing, with stealthy glances to take in their idol's play of\nexpression and gestures, Jacqueline and Simone would whisper to each\nother:\n",
                "\"Do you think he would look nice in a tie with blue spots?\"\n",
                "Then they had a chromo-lithographic ideal, based on romantic and\nfashionable books of verses, and poetic fashion-plates,--they fell in\nlove with actors, virtuosi, authors, dead and alive--Mounet-Sully,\nSamain, Debussy,--they would exchange glances with young men at concerts,\nor in a drawing-room, or in the street, and at once begin to weave\nfanciful and passionate love-affairs,--they could not help always\nwanting to fall in love, to have their lives filled with a love-affair,\nto find some excuse for being in love. Jacqueline and Simone used to\nconfide everything to each other: proof positive that they did not feel\nanything much: it was the best sort of preventive to keep them from ever\nhaving any deep feeling. On the other hand, it became a sort of chronic\nillness with them: they were the first to laugh at it, but they used\nlovingly to cultivate it. They excited each other. Simone was more\nromantic and more cautious, and used to invent wilder stories. But\nJacqueline, being more sincere and more ardent, came nearer to realizing\nthem. She was twenty times on the brink of the most hopeless\nfolly.--However, she did not commit herself, as is the way with young\npeople. There are times when these poor little crazy creatures--(such as\nwe have all been)--are within an ace, some of suicide, others of\nflinging themselves into the arms of the first man who comes along.\nOnly, thank God, almost all of them stop short at that. Jacqueline wrote\ncountless rough drafts of passionate letters to men whom she hardly knew\nby sight: but she never sent any of them, except one enthusiastic\nletter, unsigned, to an ugly, vulgar, selfish critic, who was as\ncold-hearted as he was narrow-minded. She fell in love with him over a\nfew lines in which she had discovered a rare wealth of sensibility. She\nwas fired also by a great actor, who lived near her: whenever she passed\nhis door she used to say to herself:\n",
                "\"Shall I go in?\"\nAnd once she made so bold as to go up to the door of his flat. When she\nfound herself there, she turned and fled. What could she have talked to\nhim about? She had nothing, nothing at all to say to him. She did not\nlove him. And she knew it. In the greater part of her folly she was\ndeceiving herself. And for the rest it was the old, old, delicious,\nstupid need of being in love. As Jacqueline was naturally intelligent,\nshe knew that quite well, and it kept her from making a fool of herself.\nA fool who knows his folly is worth two who don't.\n",
                "She went out a good deal. There were many young men who felt her charm,\nand more than one of them was in love with her. She did not care what\nharm she did. A pretty girl makes a cruel game of love. It seems to her\nquite natural that she should be loved, and never considers that she\nowes anything to those who love her: she is apt to believe that her\nlover is happy enough in loving her. It must be said, by way of excuse,\nthat she has no idea of what love is, although she thinks of nothing\nelse all day long. One is inclined to think that a young girl in\nsociety, brought up in the hot-house atmosphere of a great town, would\nbe more precocious than a country girl: but the opposite is the case.\nHer reading and conversation have made her obsessed by love, so obsessed\nthat in her idle life it often borders on mania: and sometimes it\nhappens that she has read the play beforehand, and knows it word for\nword by heart. But she never feels it. In love, as in art, it is useless\nto read what others have said: we can but say what we feel: and those\nwho make haste to speak before they have anything to say are as likely\nas not to say nothing.\n",
                "Jacqueline, like most young people, lived in an atmosphere clouded by\nthe dust of the feelings of others, which, while it kept her in a\nperpetual fever, with her hands burning, and her throat dry, and her\neyes sore, prevented her seeing anything. She thought she knew\neverything. It was not that she lacked the wish to know. She read and\nlistened. She had picked up a deal of information, here and there, in\nscraps, from conversation and books. She even tried to read what was\nwritten in herself. She was much better than the world in which she\nlived, for she was more sincere.\n",
                "There was one woman who had a good influence--only too brief--over her.\nThis was a sister of her father's, a woman of between forty and fifty,\nwho had never married. Tall, with regular features, though sad and\nlacking in beauty, Marthe Langeais was always dressed in black: she had\na sort of stiff distinction of feature and movement: she spoke very\nlittle, and she had a deep voice, almost like a man's. But for the clear\nlight in her intelligent gray eyes and the kind smile on her sad lips\nshe would have passed unnoticed.\n",
                "She only appeared at the Langeais' on certain days, when they were\nalone. Langeais had a great respect for her, though she bored him.\nMadame Langeais made no attempt to disguise from her husband how little\npleasure his sister's visits gave her. However, they faced their duty,\nand had her to dinner once a week, and they did not let it appear too\nglaringly that they regarded it as a duty. Langeais used to talk about\nhimself, which she always found interesting. Madame Langeais would think\nof something else, and, as a matter of habit, smile affably when she was\nspoken to. The dinner always went off very well, and she was invariably\npolite. Sometimes, even, she would be effusively affectionate when her\ntactful sister-in-law went away earlier than she had hoped: and Madame\nLangeais's charming smile would be most radiant when she had any\nparticularly pleasant memories to think of. Marthe saw through it all:\nvery little escaped her eyes: and she saw many things in her brother's\nhouse which shocked and distressed her. But she never let it appear:\nwhat was the good? She loved her brother, and had been proud of his\ncleverness and success, like the rest of the family, who had not thought\nthe triumph of the eldest son too dear a price to pay for their poverty.\nShe, at least, had preserved her independence of opinion. She was as\nclever as he was, and of a finer moral fiber, more virile--(as the women\nof France so often are; they are much superior to the men),--and she knew\nhim through and through: and when he asked her advice she used to give\nit frankly. But for a long time he had not asked it of her! He found it\nmore prudent not to know, or--(for he knew the truth as much as she\ndid),--to shut his eyes. She was proud, and drew aside. Nobody ever\ntroubled to look into her inward life, and it suited the others to\nignore her. She lived alone, went out very little, and had only a few\nnot very intimate friends. It would have been very easy to her to turn\nher brother's influence and her own talents to account: but she did not\ndo so. She had written a few articles for the leading reviews in Paris,\nhistorical and literary portraits, which had attracted some attention by\ntheir sober, just, and striking style. But she had gone no farther. She\nmight have formed interesting friendships with certain distinguished men\nand women, who had shown a desire to know her, whom also she would,\nperhaps, have been glad to know. She did not respond to their advances.\nThough she had a reserved seat for a theater when the program contained\nmusic that she loved, she did not go: and though she had the opportunity\nof traveling to a place where she knew that she would find much\npleasure, she preferred to stay at home. Her nature was a curious\ncompound of stoicism and neurasthenia, which, however, in no wise\nimpaired the integrity of her ideas. Her life was impaired, but not her\nmind. An old sorrow, known only to herself, had left its mark on her\nheart. And even more profound, even less suspected--unknown to herself,\nwas the secret illness which had begun to prey upon her. However, the\nLangeais saw only the clear expression of her eyes, which sometimes made\nthem feel embarrassed.\n",
                "Jacqueline used to take hardly any notice of her aunt in the days when\nshe was careless and gay--which was her usual condition when she was a\nchild. But when she reached the age at which there occurs a mysterious\nchange and growth in body and soul, which bring agony, disgust, terror,\nand fearful moments of depression in their train, and moments of absurd,\nhorrible dizziness, which, happily, do not last, though they make their\nvictim feel at the point of death,--the child, sinking and not daring to\ncry for help, found only her Aunt Marthe standing by her side and\nholding out her hand. Ah! the others were so far away! Her father and\nmother were as strangers to her, with their selfish affection, too\nsatisfied with themselves to think of the small troubles of a doll of\nfourteen! But her aunt guessed them, and comforted her. She did not say\nanything. She only smiled: across the table she exchanged a kindly\nglance with Jacqueline, who felt that her aunt understood her, and she\ntook refuge by her side. Marthe stroked Jacqueline's head and kissed\nher, and spoke no word.\n",
                "The little girl trusted her. When her heart was heavy she would go and\nsee her friend, who would know and understand as soon as she arrived;\nshe would be met always with the same indulgent eyes, which would infect\nher with a little of their own tranquillity. She told her aunt hardly\nanything about her imaginary love-affairs: she was ashamed of them, and\nfelt that there was no truth in them. But she confessed all the vague,\nprofound uneasiness that was in her, and was more real, her only real\ntrouble.\n",
                "\"Aunt,\" she would sigh sometimes, \"I do so long to be happy!\"\n",
                "\"Poor child!\" Marthe would say, with a smile.\n",
                "Jacqueline would lay her head in her aunt's lap, and kiss her hands as\nthey caressed her face:\n",
                "\"Do you think I shall be happy? Aunt, tell me; do you think I shall be\nhappy?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know, my dear. It rather depends on yourself.... People can\nalways be happy if they want to be.\"\n",

                "Jacqueline sulked for a little. But it did not last long. Marthe laughed\nat her so kindly that she was disarmed. She kissed her, pretending to be\nangry. But in their hearts children of that age are secretly flattered\nby predictions of suffering in later life, which is so far away. When it\nis afar off there is a halo of poetry round sorrow, and we dread nothing\nso much as a dull, even life.\n",
                "Jacqueline did not notice that her aunt's face was growing paler and\npaler. She observed that Marthe was going out less and less, but she\nattributed it to her stay-at-home disposition, about which she used\noften to tease her. Once or twice, when she called, she had met the\ndoctor coming out. She had asked her aunt:\n",

                "But Jacqueline would not listen to anything. That was a poor sort of\nexcuse!\n",
                "\"It can't be very exhausting for you to come to our house for a couple\nof hours a week! You don't love me,\" she would say. \"You love nothing\nbut your own fireside.\"\n",
                "But when at home she proudly told them how she had scolded her aunt,\nLangeais cut her short with:\n",
                "\"Let your aunt be! Don't you know that the poor creature is very ill!\"\n",
                "Jacqueline grew pale: and in a trembling voice she asked what was the\nmatter with her aunt. They tried not to tell her. Finally, she found out\nthat Marthe was dying of cancer: she had had it for some months.\n",
                "For some days Jacqueline lived in a state of terror. She was comforted a\nlittle when she saw her aunt. Marthe was mercifully not suffering any\ngreat pain. She still had her tranquil smile, which in her thin\ntransparent face seemed to shine like the light of an inward lamp.\nJacqueline said to herself:\n",
                "\"No. It is impossible. They must be mistaken. She would not be so\ncalm....\"\n",
                "She went on with the tale of her little confidences, to which Marthe\nlistened with more interest than heretofore. Only, sometimes, in the\nmiddle of a conversation, her aunt would leave the room, without giving\nany sign to show that she was in pain: and she would not return until\nthe attack was over, and her face had regained its serenity. She did not\nlike anybody to refer to her condition, and tried to hide it: she had a\nhorror of the disease that held her in its grip, and would not think of\nit: all her efforts were directed towards preserving the peace of her\nlast months. The end came sooner than it was expected. Very soon she saw\nnobody but Jacqueline. Then Jacqueline's visits had to be curtailed.\nThen came the day of parting. Marthe was lying in her bed, which she had\nnot left for some weeks, when she took a tender farewell of her little\nfriend with a few gentle, comforting words. And then she shut herself\nup, to die.\n",
                "Jacqueline passed through months of despair. Marthe's death came at the\nsame time as the very worst hours of her moral distress, against which\nMarthe had been the only person who could help her. She was horribly\ndeserted and alone. She needed the support of a religion. There was\napparently no reason why she should have lacked that support: she had\nalways been made to practise the duties of religion: her mother\npractised them regularly. But that was just the difficulty: her mother\npractised them, but her Aunt Marthe did not. And how was she to avoid\ncomparison? The eyes of a child are susceptible to many untruths, to\nwhich her elders never give a thought, and children notice many\nweaknesses and contradictions. Jacqueline noticed that her mother and\nthose who said that they believed had as much fear of death as though\nthere had been no faith in them. No: religion was not a strong enough\nsupport.... And in addition there were certain personal experiences,\nfeelings of revolt and disgust, a tactless confessor who had hurt\nher.... She went on practising, but without faith, just as she paid\ncalls, because she had been well brought up. Religion, like the world,\nseemed to her to be utterly empty. Her only stay was the memory of the\ndead woman, in which she was wrapped up. She had many grounds for\nself-reproach in her treatment of her aunt, whom in her childish\nselfishness she had often neglected, while now she called to her in\nvain. She idealized her image: and the great example which Marthe had\nleft upon her mind of a profound life of meditation helped to fill her\nwith distaste for the life of the world, in which there was no truth or\nserious purpose. She saw nothing but its hypocrisy, and those amiable\ncompromises, which at any other time would have amused her, now revolted\nher. She was in a condition of moral hypersensitiveness, and everything\nhurt her: her conscience was raw. Her eyes were opened to certain facts\nwhich hitherto had escaped her in her heedlessness.\n",
                "One afternoon she was in the drawing-room with her mother. Madame\nLangeais was receiving a caller,--a fashionable painter, a good-looking,\npompous man, who was often at the house, but not on terms of intimacy.\nJacqueline had a feeling that she was in the way, but that only made her\nmore determined to stay. Madame Langeais was not very well; she had a\nheadache, which made her a little dull, or perhaps it was one of those\nheadache preventives which the ladies of to-day eat like sweets, so that\nthey have the result of completely emptying their pretty heads, and she\nwas not very guarded in what she said. In the course of the conversation\nshe thoughtlessly called her visitor:\n",
                "\"My dear....\"\n",
                "She noticed the slip at once. He did not flinch any more than she, and\nthey went on talking politely. Jacqueline, who was pouring out tea, was\nso amazed that she almost dropped a cup. She had a feeling that they\nwere exchanging a meaning smile behind her back. She turned and\nintercepted their privy looks, which were immediately disguised.--The\ndiscovery upset her completely. Though she had been brought up with the\nutmost freedom, and had often heard and herself laughed and talked about\nsuch intrigues, it hurt her so that she could hardly bear it when she\nsaw that her mother.... Her mother: no, it was not the same thing!...\nWith her habitual exaggeration she rushed from one extreme to the\nother. Till then she had suspected nothing. Thereafter she suspected\neverything. Implacably she read new meanings into this and that detail\nof her mother's behavior in the past. And no doubt Madame Langeais's\nfrivolity furnished only too many grounds for her suppositions: but\nJacqueline added to them. She longed to be more intimate with her\nfather, who had always been nearer to her, his quality of mind having a\ngreat attraction for her. She longed to love him more, and to pity him.\nBut Langeais did not seem to stand in much need of pity: and a\nsuspicion, more dreadful even than the first, crossed the girl's heated\nimagination,--that her father knew nothing, but that it suited him to\nknow nothing, and that, so long as he were allowed to go his own way, he\ndid not care.\n",
                "Then Jacqueline felt that she was lost. She dared not despise them. She\nloved them. But she could not go on living in their house. Her\nfriendship with Simone Adam was no help at all. She judged severely the\nfoibles of her former boon companion. She did not spare herself:\neverything that was ugly and mediocre in herself made her suffer\nterribly: she clung desperately to the pure memory of Marthe. But that\nmemory was fading: she felt that the stream of time, one day following\nanother, would cover it up and wash away all trace of it. And then there\nwould be an end of everything: she would be like the rest, sunk deep in\nthe mire.... Oh! if she could only escape from, such a world, at any\ncost! Save me! Save me!...\n",
                "It was just when she was in this fever of despair, feeling her utter\ndestitution, filled with passionate disgust and mystic expectancy,\nholding out her arms to an unknown saviour, that she met Olivier.\n",
                "Madame Langeais, of course, invited Christophe, who, that winter, was\nthe musician of the hour. Christophe accepted, and, as usual, did not\ntake any trouble to make himself pleasant. However, Madame Langeais\nthought him charming;--he could do anything he liked, as long as he was\nthe fashion: everybody would go on thinking him charming, while the\nfashion ran its allotted course of a few months.--Jacqueline, who, for\nthe time being, was outside the current, was not so charmed with him:\nthe mere fact that Christophe was belauded by certain people was enough\nto make her diffident about him. Besides, Christophe's bluntness, and\nhis loud way of speaking, and his noisy gaiety, offended her. In her\nthen state of mind the joy of living seemed a coarse thing to her: her\neyes were fixed on the twilight melancholy of the soul, and she fancied\nthat she loved it. There was too much sunlight in Christophe.\n",
                "But when she talked to him he told her about Olivier: he always had to\nbring his friend into every pleasant thing that happened to him: it\nwould have seemed to him a selfish use of a new friendship if he had not\nset aside a part of it for Olivier. He told Jacqueline so much about\nhim, that she felt a secret emotion in thus catching a glimpse of a soul\nso much in accordance with her ideas, and made her mother invite him\ntoo. Olivier did not accept at first, so that Christophe and Jacqueline\nwere left to complete their imaginary portrait of him at their leisure,\nand, of course, he was found to be very like it when at last he made up\nhis mind to go.\n",
                "He went, but hardly spoke a word. He did not need to speak. His\nintelligent eyes, his smile, his refined manners, the tranquillity that\nwas in and inundated by his personality, could not but attract\nJacqueline. Christophe, by contrast, stood as a foil to Olivier's\nshining qualities. She did not show anything, for she was fearful of the\nfeeling stirring in her: she confined herself to talking to Christophe,\nbut it was always about Olivier. Christophe was only too happy to talk\nabout his friend, and did not notice Jacqueline's pleasure in the\nsubject of their conversation. He used to talk about himself, and she\nwould listen agreeably enough, though she was not in the least\ninterested: then, without seeming to do so, she would bring the\nconversation round to those episodes in his life which included Olivier.\n",
                "Jacqueline's pretty ways were dangerous for a man who was not on his\nguard. Without knowing it Christophe fell in love with her: it gave him\npleasure to go to the house again: he took pains with his dress: and a\nfeeling, which he well knew, began to tinge all his ideas with its\ntender smiling languor. Olivier was in love with her too, and had been\nfrom their first meeting: he thought she had no regard for him, and\nsuffered in silence. Christophe made his state even worse by telling him\njoyously, as they left the Langeais' house, what he had said to\nJacqueline and what she had said to him. The idea never occurred to\nOlivier that Jacqueline should like him. Although, by dint of living\nwith Christophe, he had become more optimistic, he still distrusted\nhimself: he could not believe that any woman would ever love him, for he\nsaw himself too clearly, and with eyes that saw too truthfully:--what\nman is there would be worthy to be loved; if it were for his merits, and\nnot by the magic and indulgence of love?\n",
                "One evening when he had been invited to the Langeais', he felt that it\nwould make him too unhappy to feel Jacqueline's indifference: he said\nthat he was too tired and told Christophe to go without him. Christophe\nsuspected nothing, and went off in high delight. In his na\u00efve egoism he\nthought only of the pleasure of having Jacqueline all to himself. He was\nnot suffered to rejoice for long. When she heard that Olivier was not\ncoming, Jacqueline at once became peevish, irritable, bored, and\ndispirited: she lost all desire to please: she did not listen to\nChristophe, and answered him at random: and he had the humiliation of\nseeing her stifle a weary yawn. She was near tears. Suddenly she went\naway in the middle of the evening, and did not appear again.\n",
                "Christophe went home discomfited. All the way home he tried to explain\nthis sudden change of front: and the truth began dimly to dawn on him.\nWhen he reached his rooms he found Olivier waiting for him, and then,\nwith a would-be indifferent air, Olivier asked him about the party.\nChristophe told him of his discomfiture, and he saw Olivier's face\nbrighten as he went on.\n",
                "\"Still tired?\" he asked. \"Why didn't you go to bed?\"\n",
                "\"Oh! I'm much better,\" said Olivier. \"I'm not the least tired now.\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" said Christophe slyly, \"I fancy it has done you a lot of good not\ngoing.\"\n",
                "He looked at him affectionately and roguishly, and went away into his\nown room: and then, when he was alone, he began to laugh quietly, and\nlaughed until he cried:\n",
                "\"Little minx!\" he thought. \"She was making a game of me! And he was\ndeceiving me, too. What a secret they made of it!\"\n",
                "From that moment he plucked out every personal thought of Jacqueline\nfrom his heart: and, like a broody hen hatching her eggs, he hatched the\nromance of the young lovers. Without seeming to know their secret, and\nwithout betraying either to the other, he helped them, though they never\nknew it.\n",
                "He thought it his solemn duty to study Jacqueline's character to see if\nOlivier could be happy with her. And, being very tactless, he horrified\nJacqueline with the ridiculous questions he put to her about her tastes,\nher morality, etc., etc.\n",
                "\"Idiot! What does he mean?\" Jacqueline would think angrily, and refuse\nto answer him, and turn her back on him.\n",
                "And Olivier would be delighted to see Jacqueline paying no more\nattention to Christophe. And Christophe would be overjoyed at seeing\nOlivier's happiness. His joy was patent, and revealed itself much more\nobstreperously than Olivier's. And as Jacqueline could not explain it,\nand never dreamed that Christophe had a much clearer knowledge of their\nlove than she had herself, she thought him unbearable: she could not\nunderstand how Olivier could be so infatuated with such a vulgar,\ncumbersome friend. Christophe divined her thoughts, and took a malicious\ndelight in infuriating her: then he would step aside, and say that he\nwas too busy to accept the Langeais' invitations, so as to leave\nJacqueline and Olivier alone together.\n",
                "However, he was not altogether without anxiety concerning the future. He\nregarded himself as responsible in a large measure for the marriage that\nwas in the making, and he worried over it, for he had a fair insight\ninto Jacqueline's character, and he was afraid of many things: her\nwealth first of all, her up-bringing, her surroundings, and, above all,\nher weakness. He remembered his old friend Colette, though, no doubt, he\nadmitted that Jacqueline was truer, more frank, more passionate: there\nwas in the girl an ardent aspiration towards a life of courage, an\nalmost heroic desire for it.\n",
                "\"But desiring isn't everything,\" thought Christophe, remembering a jest\nof Diderot's: \"the chief thing is a straight backbone.\"\n",
                "He would have liked to warn Olivier of the danger. But when he saw him\ncome back from being with Jacqueline, with his eyes lit with joy, he had\nnot the heart to speak, and he thought:\n",
                "\"The poor things are happy. I won't disturb their happiness.\"\n",
                "Gradually his affection for Olivier made him share his friend's\nconfidence. He took heart of grace, and at last began to believe that\nJacqueline was just as Olivier saw her and as she wished to appear in\nher own eyes. She meant so well! She loved Olivier for all the qualities\nwhich made him different from herself and the world she lived in:\nbecause he was poor, because he was uncompromising in his moral ideas,\nbecause he was awkward and shy in society. Her love was so pure and so\nwhole that she longed to be poor too, and, sometimes, almost ... yes,\nalmost to be ugly, so that she might be sure that he loved her for\nherself, and for the love with which her heart was so full, the love for\nwhich her heart was so hungry.... Ah! Sometimes, when he was not with\nher, she would go pale and her hands would tremble. She would seem to\nscoff at her emotion, and pretend to be thinking of something else, and\nto take no notice of it. She would talk mockingly of things. But\nsuddenly she would break off, and rush away and shut herself up in her\nroom: and then, with the doors locked, and the curtains drawn over the\nwindow, she would sit there, with her knees tight together, and her\nelbows close against her sides, and her arms folded across her breast,\nwhile she tried to repress the beating of her heart: she would sit there\nhuddled together, never stirring, hardly breathing: she dared not move\nfor fear lest her happiness should escape if she so much as lifted a\nfinger. She would sit holding her love close, close to her body in\nsilence.\n",
                "And now Christophe was absolutely determined that Olivier should succeed\nin his wooing. He fussed round him like a mother, supervised his\ndressing, presumed to give him advice as to what he should wear, and\neven--(think of it!)--tied his tie for him. Olivier bore with him\npatiently at the cost of having to retie his tie on the stairs when\nChristophe was no longer present. He smiled inwardly, but he was touched\nby such great affection. Besides, his love had made him timid, and he\nwas not sure of himself, and was glad of Christophe's advice. He used to\ntell him everything that happened when he was with Jacqueline, and\nChristophe would be just as moved by it as himself, and sometimes at\nnight he would lie awake for hours trying to find the means of making\nthe path of love smoother for his friend.\n",
                "It was in the garden of the Langeais' villa, near Paris, on the\noutskirts of the forest of Isle-Adam, that Olivier and Jacqueline had\nthe interview which was the turning-point in their lives.\n",
                "Christophe had gone down with his friend, but he had found a harmonium\nin the house, and sat playing so as to leave the lovers to walk about\nthe garden in peace.--Truth to tell, they did not wish it. They were\nafraid to be left alone. Jacqueline was silent and rather hostile. On\nhis last visit Olivier had been conscious of a change in her manner, a\nsudden coldness, an expression in her eyes which was strange, hard, and\nalmost inimical. It froze him. He dared not ask her for an explanation,\nfor he was fearful of hearing cruel words on the lips of the girl he\nloved. He trembled whenever he saw Christophe leave them, for it seemed\nto him that his presence was his only safeguard against the blow which\nthreatened to fall upon him.\n",
                "It was not that Jacqueline loved Olivier less. Rather she was more in\nlove with him, and it was that that made her hostile. Love, with which\ntill then she had only played, love, to which she had so often called,\nwas there, before her eyes: she saw it gaping before her like an abyss,\nand she flung back in terror: she could not understand it, and wondered:\n",
                "\"Why? Why? What does it mean?\"\n",
                "Then she would look at Olivier with the expression which so hurt him,\nand think:\n",
                "\"Who is this man?\"\n",
                "And she could not tell. He was a stranger.\n",
                "\"Why do I love him?\"\n",
                "She could not tell.\n",
                "\"Do I love him?\"\n",
                "She could not tell.... She did not know: and yet she knew that she was\ncaught: she was in the toils of love: she was on the point of losing\nherself in love, losing herself utterly; her will, her independence, her\negoism, her dreams of the future, all were to be swallowed up by the\nmonster. And she would harden herself in anger, and sometimes she would\nfeel that she almost hated Olivier.\n",
                "They went to the very end of the garden, into the kitchen-garden, which\nwas cut off from the lawns by a hedge of tall trees. They sauntered down\nthe paths bordered on either side with gooseberry bushes, with their\nclusters of red and golden fruit, and beds of strawberries, the\nfragrance of which scented the air. It was June: but there had been\nstorms, and the weather was cold. The sky was gray and the light dim:\nthe low-hanging clouds moved in a heavy mass, drifting with the wind,\nwhich blew only in the higher air, and never touched the earth; no leaf\nstirred: but the air was very fresh. Everything was shrouded in\nmelancholy, even their hearts, swelling with the grave happiness that\nwas in them. And from the other end of the garden, through the open\nwindows of the villa, out of sight, there came the sound of the\nharmonium, grinding out the Fugue in E Flat Minor of Johann Sebastian\nBach. They sat down on the coping of a well, both pale and silent. And\nOlivier saw tears trickling down Jacqueline's cheeks.\n",
                "\"You are crying?\" he murmured, with trembling lips.\n",
                "And the tears came to his own eyes.\n",
                "He took her hand. She laid her head on Olivier's shoulder. She gave up\nthe struggle: she was vanquished, and it was such sweet comfort to her!\n... They wept silently as they sat listening to the music under the\nmoving canopy of the heavy clouds, which in their noiseless flight\nseemed to skim the tops of the trees. They thought of all that they had\nsuffered, and perhaps--who knows?--of all that they were to suffer in\nthe future. There are moments when music summons forth all the sadness\nwoven into the woof of a human being's destiny....\n",
                "After a moment or two Jacqueline dried her eyes and looked at Olivier.\nAnd suddenly they kissed. O boundless happiness! Religious happiness!\nSo sweet and so profound that it is almost sorrow!\n",
                "[Illustration: Musical notation]\n",
                "Jacqueline asked:\n",
                "\"Was your sister like you?\"\n",
                "Olivier felt a sudden pang. He said:\n",
                "\"Why do you ask me about her? Did you know her?\"\n",
                "She replied:\n",
                "\"Christophe told me.... You have suffered?\"\n",
                "Olivier nodded: he was too much moved to speak.\n",
                "\"I have suffered too,\" she said.\n",
                "She told him of the friend who had been taken from her, her beloved\nMarthe and with her heart big with emotion she told him how she had\nwept, wept until she thought she was going to die.\n",
                "\"You will help me?\" she said, in a beseeching tone. \"You will help me\nto live, and be good, and to be a little like her? Poor Marthe, you will\nlove her too?\"\n",
                "\"We will love them both, as they both love each other.\"\n",
                "\"I wish they were here.\"\n",
                "\"They are here.\"\n",
                "They sat there locked in each other's arms: they hardly breathed, and\ncould feel heart beating to heart. A gentle drizzle was falling,\nfalling. Jacqueline shivered.\n",
                "\"Let us go in,\" she said.\n",
                "Under the trees it was almost dark. Olivier kissed Jacqueline's wet\nhair: she turned her face up to him, and, for the first time, he felt\nloving lips against his, a girl's lips, warm and parted a little. They\nwere nigh swooning.\n",
                "Near the house they stopped once more:\n",
                "\"How utterly alone we were!\" he said.\n",
                "He had already forgotten Christophe.\n",
                "They remembered him at length. The music had stopped. They went in.\nChristophe was sitting at the harmonium with his head in his hands,\ndreaming, he too, of many things in the past. When he heard the door\nopen, he started from his dream, and turned to them affectionately with\na solemn, tender smile lighting up his face. He saw in their eyes what\nhad happened, pressed their hands warmly, and said:\n",
                "\"Sit down, and I'll play you something.\"\n",
                "They sat down, and he played the piano, telling in music all that was in\nhis heart, and the great love he had for them. When he had done they all\nthree sat in silence. Then he got up and looked at them. He looked so\nkind, and so much older, so much stronger than they! For the first time\nshe began to appreciate what he was. He hugged them both, and said to\nJacqueline:\n",
                "\"You will love him dearly, won't you? You will love him dearly?\"\n",
                "They were filled with gratitude towards him. But at once he turned the\nconversation, laughed, went to the window, and sprang out into the\ngarden.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "During the days following he kept urging Olivier to go and propose his\nsuit to Jacqueline's parents. Olivier dared not, dreading the refusal\nwhich he anticipated. Christophe also insisted on his setting about\nfinding work, for even supposing the Langeais accepted him, he could not\ntake Jacqueline's fortune unless he were himself in a position to earn\nhis living. Olivier was of the same opinion, though he did not share his\nviolent and rather comic distrust of wealthy marriages. It was a rooted\nidea in Christophe's mind that riches are death to the soul. It was on\nthe tip of his tongue to quote the saying of a wise beggar to a rich\nlady who was worried in her mind about the next life:\n",
                "\"What, madame, you have millions, and you want to have an immortal soul\ninto the bargain?\"\n",
                "\"Beware of women,\" he would say to Olivier--half in jest, half in\nearnest--\"beware of women, but be twenty times more wary of rich women.\nWomen love art, perhaps, but they strangle the artist. Rich women poison\nboth art and artists. Wealth is a disease. And women are more\nsusceptible to it than men. Every rich man is an abnormal being.... You\nlaugh? You don't take me seriously? Look you: does a rich man know what\nlife is? Does he keep himself in touch with the raw realities of life?\nDoes he feel on his face the stinging breath of poverty, the smell of\nthe bread that he must earn, of the earth that he must dig? Can he\nunderstand, does he even see people and things as they are?... When I\nwas a little boy I was once or twice taken for a drive in the Grand\nDuke's landau. We drove through fields in which I knew every blade of\ngrass, through woods that I adored, where I used to run wild all by\nmyself. Well: I saw nothing at all. The whole country had become as\nstiff and starched as the idiots with whom I was driving. Between the\nfields and my heart there was not only the curtain of the souls of those\nformal people. The wooden planks beneath my feet, the moving platform\nbeing rolled over the face of Nature, were quite enough. To feel that\nthe earth is my mother, I must have my feet firmly planted on her womb,\nlike a newborn child issuing to the light. Wealth severs the tie which\nbinds men to the earth, and holds the sons of the earth together. And\nthen how can you expect to be an artist? The artist is the voice of the\nearth. A rich man cannot be a great artist. He would need a thousand\ntimes more genius to be so under such unfavorable conditions. Even if he\nsucceeds his art must be a hot-house fruit. The great Goethe struggled\nin vain: parts of his soul were atrophied, he lacked certain of the\nvital organs, which were killed by his wealth. You have nothing like the\nvitality of a Goethe, and you would be destroyed by wealth, especially\nby a rich woman, a fate which Goethe did at least avoid. Only the man\ncan withstand the scourge. He has in him such native brutality, such a\nrich deposit of rude, healthy instincts binding him to the earth, that\nhe alone has any chance of escape. But the woman is tainted by the\npoison, and she communicates the taint to others. She acquires a taste\nfor the reeking scent of wealth, and cannot do without it. A woman who\ncan be rich and yet remain sound in heart is a prodigy as rare as a\nmillionaire who has genius.... And I don't like monsters. Any one who\nhas more than enough to live on is a monster--a human cancer preying\nupon the lives of the rest of humanity.\"\n",
                "Olivier laughed:\n",
                "\"What do you want?\" he said. \"I can't stop loving Jacqueline because she\nis not poor, or force her to become poor for love of me.\"\n",
                "\"Well, if you can't save her, at least save yourself. That's the best\nway of saving her. Keep yourself pure. Work.\"\n",
                "Olivier did not need to go to Christophe for scruples. He was even more\nnicely sensitive than he in such matters. Not that he took Christophe's\ndiatribes against money seriously: he had been rich himself, and did not\nloathe riches, and thought them a very good setting for Jacqueline's\npretty face. But it was intolerable to think that his love might in any\nway be contaminated with an imputation of interest. He applied to have\nhis name restored to the University list. For the time being he could\nnot hope for anything better than a moderate post in a provincial\nschool. It was a poor wedding-present to give to Jacqueline. He told her\nabout it timidly. Jacqueline found it difficult at first to see his\npoint of view: she attributed it to an excessive pride, put into his\nhead by Christophe, and she thought it ridiculous: was it not more\nnatural between lovers to set no store by riches or poverty, and was it\nnot rather shabby to refuse to be indebted to her when it would give her\nsuch great joy?... However, she threw herself in with Olivier's plans:\ntheir austerity and discomfort were the very things that brought her\nround, for she found in them an opportunity of gratifying her desire for\nmoral heroism. In her condition of proud revolt against her surroundings\nwhich had been induced by the death of her aunt, and was exalted by her\nlove, she had gone so far as to deny every element in her nature which\nwas in contradiction to her mystic ardor: in all sincerity her whole\nbeing was strained, like a bow, after an ideal of a pure and difficult\nlife, radiant with happiness.... The obstacles, the very smallness and\ndullness of her future condition in life, were a joy to her. How good\nand beautiful it would all be!...\n",
                "Madame Langeais was too much taken up with herself to pay much attention\nto what was going on about her. For some time past she had been thinking\nof little outside her health: she spent her whole time in treating\nimaginary illnesses, and trying one doctor after another: each of them\nin turn was her saviour, and went on enjoying that position for a\nfortnight: then it was another's turn. She would stay away from home for\nmonths in expensive sanatoria, where she religiously carried out all\nsorts of preposterous prescriptions to the letter. She had forgotten her\nhusband and daughter.\n",
                "M. Langeais was not so indifferent, and had begun to suspect the existence\nof the affair. His paternal jealousy made him feel it. He had\nfor Jacqueline that strange pure affection which many fathers feel for\ntheir daughters, an elusive, indefinable feeling, a mysterious,\nvoluptuous, and almost sacred curiosity, in living once more in the\nlives of fellow-creatures who are of their blood, who are themselves,\nand are women. In such secrets of the heart there are many lights and\nshadows which it is healthier to ignore. Hitherto it had amused him to\nsee his daughter making calfish young men fall in love with her: he\nloved her so, romantic, coquettish, and discreet--(just as he was\nhimself).--But when he saw that this affair threatened to become more\nserious, he grew anxious. He began by making fun of Olivier to\nJacqueline, and then he criticised him with a certain amount of\nbitterness. Jacqueline laughed at first, and said:\n",
                "\"Don't say such hard things, father: you would find it awkward later on,\nsupposing I wanted to marry him.\"\n",
                "M. Langeais protested loudly, and said she was mad: with the result that\nshe lost her head completely. He declared that he would never let her\nmarry Olivier. She vowed that she would marry him. The veil was rent. He\nsaw that he was nothing to her. In his fatherly egoism it had never\noccurred to him, and he was angry. He swore that neither Olivier nor\nChristophe should ever set foot inside his house again. Jacqueline lost\nher temper, and one fine morning Olivier opened the door to admit a\nyoung woman, pale and determined looking, who rushed in like a\nwhirlwind, and said:\n",
                "\"Take me away with you! My father and mother won't hear of it. I _will_\nmarry you. You must compromise me.\"\n",
                "Olivier was alarmed though touched by it, and did not even try to argue\nwith her. Fortunately Christophe was there. Ordinarily he was the least\nreasonable of men, but now he reasoned with them. He pointed out what a\nscandal there would be, and how they would suffer for it. Jacqueline bit\nher lip angrily, and said:\n",
                "\"Very well. We will kill ourselves.\"\n",
                "So far from frightening Olivier, her threat only helped to make up his\nmind to side with her. Christophe had no small difficulty in making the\ncrazy pair have a little patience: before taking such desperate measures\nthey might as well try others: let Jacqueline go home, and he would go\nand see M. Langeais and plead their cause.\n",
                "A queer advocate! M. Langeais nearly kicked him out on the first words\nhe said: but then the absurdity of the situation struck him, and it\namused him. Little by little the gravity of his visitor and his\nexpression of honesty and absolute sincerity began to make an\nimpression: however, he would not fall in with his contentions, and went\non firing ironical remarks at him. Christophe pretended not to hear:\nbut every now and then as a more than usually biting shaft struck home he\nwould stop and draw himself up in silence; then he would go on again.\nOnce he brought his fist down on the table with a thud, and said:\n",
                "\"I beg of you to believe that it has given me no pleasure to call on\nyou: I have to control myself to keep from retaliating on you for\ncertain things you have said: but I think it my duty to speak to you,\nand I am doing so. Forget me, as I forget myself, and weigh well what I\nam telling you.\"\n",
                "M. Langeais listened: and when he heard of the project of suicide, he\nshrugged his shoulders and pretended to laugh: but he was shaken. He was\ntoo clever to take such a threat as a joke: he knew that he had to deal\nwith the insanity of a girl in love. One of his mistresses, a gay,\ngentle creature, whom he had thought incapable of putting her boastful\nthreat into practice, had shot herself with a revolver before his eyes:\nshe did not kill herself at once, but the scene lived in his memory....\nNo, one can never be sure with women. He felt a pang at his heart....\n\"She wishes it? Very well: so be it, and so much the worse for her,\nlittle fool!...\" He would have granted anything rather than drive his\ndaughter to extremes. In truth he might have used diplomacy, and\npretended to give his consent to gain time, gently to wean Jacqueline\nfrom Olivier. But doing so meant giving himself more trouble than he\ncould or would be bothered with. Besides, he was weak: and the mere fact\nthat he had angrily said \"No!\" to Jacqueline, now inclined him to say\n\"Yes.\" After all, what does one know of life? Perhaps the child was\nright. The great thing was that they should love each other. M. Langeais\nknew quite well that Olivier was a serious young man, and perhaps had\ntalent.... He gave his consent.\n",

                "The day before the marriage the two friends sat up together into the\nsmall hours. They did not wish to lose the last hours of their dear life\ntogether.--But already it was in the past. It was like those sad\nfarewells on the station platform when there is a long wait before the\ntrain moves: one insists on staying, and looking and talking. But one's\nheart is not in it: one's friend has already gone.... Christophe tried\nto talk. He stopped in the middle of a sentence, seeing the absent look\nin Olivier's eyes, and he said, with a smile:\n",
                "\"You are so far away!\"\n",
                "Olivier was confused and begged his pardon. It made him sad to realize\nthat his thoughts were wandering during the last intimate moments with\nhis friend. But Christophe pressed his hand, and said:\n",
                "\"Come, don't constrain yourself. I am happy. Go on dreaming, my boy.\"\n",
                "They stayed by the window, leaning out side by side, and looking through\nthe darkness down into the garden. After some time Christophe said to\nOlivier:\n",
                "\"You are running away from me. You think you can escape me? You are\nthinking of your Jacqueline. But I shall catch you up. I, too, am\nthinking of her.\"\n",
                "\"Poor old fellow,\" said Olivier, \"and I was thinking of you! And\neven....\"\n",
                "He stopped.\n",
                "Christophe laughed and finished the sentence for him.\n",
                "\"... And even taking a lot of trouble over it!...\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Christophe turned out very fine, almost smart, for the wedding. There\nwas no religious ceremony: neither the indifferent Olivier nor the\nrebellious Jacqueline had wished it. Christophe had written a symphonic\nfragment for the ceremony at the _mairie_, but at the last moment\nhe gave up the idea when he realized what a civil marriage is: he\nthought such ceremonies absurd. People need to have lost both faith and\nliberty before they can have any belief in them. When a true Catholic\ntakes the trouble to become a free-thinker he is not likely to endow a\nfunctionary of the civil State with a religious character. Between God\nand his own conscience there is no room for a State religion. The State\nregisters, it does not bind man and wife together.\n",
                "The marriage of Olivier and Jacqueline was not likely to make Christophe\nregret his decision. Olivier listened with a faintly ironical air of\naloofness to the Mayor ponderously fawning upon the young couple, and\nthe wealthy relations, and the witnesses who wore decorations.\nJacqueline did not listen: and she furtively put out her tongue at\nSimone Adam, who was watching her: she had made a bet with her that\nbeing \"married\" would not affect her in the least, and it looked as\nthough she would win it: it hardly seemed to occur to her that it was\nshe who was being married: the idea of it tickled her. The rest were\nposing for the onlookers: and the onlookers were taking them all in. M.\nLangeais was showing off: in spite of his sincere affection for his\ndaughter, he was chiefly occupied in taking stock of the guests to find\nout whether he had left any gaps in his list of invitations. Only\nChristophe was moved: not one of the rest, relations, bride, and\nbridegroom, or the Mayor officiating, showed any emotion: he stood\ngazing hungrily at Olivier, who did not look at him.\n",
                "In the evening the young couple left for Italy. Christophe and M.\nLangeais went with them to the station. They seemed happy, not at all\nsorry to be going, and did not conceal their impatience for the train to\nmove. Olivier looked like a boy, and Jacqueline like a little girl....\nWhat a tender, melancholy charm is in such partings! The father is a\nlittle sad to see his child taken away by a stranger, and for what!...\nand to see her go away from him forever. But they feel nothing but a new\nintoxicating sense of liberty. There are no more hindrances to life:\nnothing can stop them ever again: they seem to have reached the very\nsummit: now might they die readily, for they have everything, and\nnothing to fear.... But soon they see that it was no more than a stage\nin the journey. The road still lies before them, and winds round the\nmountain: and there are very few who reach the second stage....\n",
                "The train bore them away into the night. Christophe and M. Langeais went\nhome together. Christophe said with naive archness:\n",
                "\"Now we are both widowed!\"\n",
                "M. Langeais began to laugh. He liked Christophe now that he knew him\nbetter. They said good-by, and went their ways. They were both unhappy,\nwith an odd mixture of sadness and sweetness. Sitting alone in his room\nChristophe thought:\n",
                "\"The best of my soul is happy.\"\n",
                "Nothing had been altered in Olivier's room. They had arranged that until\nOlivier returned and settled in a new house his furniture and belongings\nshould stay with Christophe. It was as though he himself was still\npresent. Christophe looked at the portrait of Antoinette, placed it on\nhis desk, and said to it:\n",
                "\"My dear, are you glad?\"\n",
                "He wrote often--rather too often--to Olivier. He had a few vaguely\nwritten letters, which were increasingly distant in tone. He was\ndisappointed, but not much affected by it. He persuaded himself that it\nmust be so, and he had no anxiety as to the future of their friendship.\n",
                "His solitude did not trouble him. Far from it: he did not have enough of\nit to suit his taste. He was beginning to suffer from the patronage of\nthe _Grand Journal_. Ars\u00e8ne Gamache had a tendency to believe that\nhe had proprietary rights in the famous men whom he had taken the\ntrouble to discover: he took it as a matter of course that their fame\nshould be associated with his own, much as Louis XIV. grouped Moli\u00e8re,\nLe Brun, and Lulli about his throne. Christophe discovered that the\nauthor of the _Hymn to Aegis_ was not more imperial or more of a\nnuisance to art than his patron of the _Grand Journal_. For the\njournalist, who knew no more about art than the Emperor, had opinions no\nless decided about it: he could not tolerate the existence of anything\nhe did not like: he decreed that it was bad and pernicious: and he would\nruin it in the public interest. It is both comic and terrible to see\nsuch coarse-grained uncultivated men of affairs presuming to control not\nonly politics and money, but also the mind, and offering it a kennel\nwith a collar and a dish of food, or, if it refuses, having the power to\nlet loose against it thousands of idiots whom they have trained into a\ndocile pack of hounds!--Christophe was not the sort of man to let\nhimself be schooled and disciplined. It seemed to him a very bad thing\nthat an ignoramus should take upon himself to tell him what he ought and\nought not to do in music: and he gave him to understand that art needed\na much more severe training than politics. Also, without any sort of\npolite circumlocution, he declined a proposal that he should set to\nmusic a libretto, which the author, a leading member of the staff of the\npaper, was trying to place, while it was highly recommended by his\nchief. It had the effect of cooling his relations with Gamache.\n",
                "Christophe did not mind that in the least. Though he had so lately risen\nfrom his obscurity, he was longing to return to it. He found himself\n\"exposed to that great light in which a man is lost among the many.\"\nThere were too many people bothering their heads about him. He pondered\nthese words of Goethe:\n",
                "_\"When a writer has attracted attention by a good piece of work, the\npublic tries to prevent his producing another.... The brooding talent is\ndragged out into the hurly-burly of the world, in spite of itself,\nbecause every one thinks he will be able to appropriate a part of\nit.\"_\n",
                "He shut his door upon the outside world, and began to seek the company\nof some of his old friends in his own house. He revisited the Arnauds,\nwhom he had somewhat neglected. Madame Arnaud, who was left alone for\npart of the day, had time to think of the sorrows of others. She thought\nhow empty Christophe's life must be now that Olivier was gone: and she\novercame her shyness so far as to invite him to dinner. If she had\ndared, she would even have offered to go in from time to time and tidy\nhis rooms: but she was not bold enough: and no doubt it was better so:\nfor Christophe did not like to have people worrying about him. But he\naccepted the invitation to dinner, and made a habit of going in to the\nArnauds' every evening.\n",
                "He found them just as united, living in the same atmosphere of rather\nsad, sorrowful tenderness, though it was even grayer than before, Arnaud\nwas passing through a period of depression, brought on by the wear and\ntear of his life as a teacher,--a life of exhausting labor, in which one\nday is like unto another, and each day's work is like that of the next,\nlike a wheel turning in one place, without ever stopping, or ever\nadvancing. Though he was very patient, the good man was passing through\na crisis of discouragement. He let certain acts of injustice prey upon\nhim, and was inclined to think that all his zeal was futile. Madame\nArnaud would comfort him with kind words: she seemed to be just as calm\nand peaceful as in the old days: but her face was thinner. In her\npresence Christophe would congratulate Arnaud on having such a sensible\nwife.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" Arnaud would say, \"she is a good little creature; nothing ever puts\nher out. She is lucky: so am I. If she had suffered in this cursed\nlife, I don't see how I could have got through.\"\n",
                "Madame Arnaud would blush and say nothing. Then in her even tones she\nwould talk of something else.--Christophe's visits had their usual good\neffect: they brought light in their train: and he, for his part, found\nit very pleasant to feel the warmth of their kind, honest hearts.\n",
                "Another friend, a girl, came into his life. Or rather he sought her out:\nfor though she longed to know him, she could not have made the effort to\ngo and see him. She was a young woman of a little more than twenty-five,\na musician, and she had taken the first prize at the Conservatoire: her\nname was C\u00e9cile Fleury. She was short and rather thick-set. She had\nheavy eyebrows, fine, large eyes, with a soft expression, a short,\nbroad, turned-up nose, inclined to redness, like a duck's beak, thick\nlips, kind and tender, an energetic chin, heavy and solid, and her\nforehead was broad, but not high. Her hair was done up in a large bun at\nthe back of her neck. She had strong arms and a pianist's hands, very\nlong, with a splayed thumb and square finger-tips. The general\nimpression she gave was one of a rather sluggish vitality and of rude\nrustic health. She lived with her mother, who was very dear to her: a\ngood, kind woman, who took not the smallest interest in music though she\nused to talk about it, because she was always hearing about it, and knew\neverything that happened in Musicopolis. She had a dull, even life, gave\nlessons all day long, and sometimes concerts, of which nobody took any\nnotice. She used to go home late at night, on foot or in an omnibus,\nworn out, but quite good-tempered: and she used to practise her scales\nbravely and trim her own hats, talking a great deal, laughing readily,\nand often singing for nothing.\n",
                "She had not been spoiled by life. She knew the value of a little comfort\nwhen she had earned it by her own efforts,--the joy of a little\npleasure, or a little scarcely perceptible advance in her position or\nher work. Indeed, if one month she could only earn five francs more than\nin the last, or if she could at length manage to play a certain passage\nof Chopin which she had been struggling with for weeks,--she would be\nquite happy. Her work, which was not excessive, exactly fitted her\naptitude for it, and gave her a healthy satisfaction. Playing, singing,\ngiving lessons gave her a pleasant feeling of satisfied activity, normal\nand regular, and at the same time a modest competence and a comfortable\nplacid success. She had a healthy appetite, ate much, slept well, and\nwas never ill.\n",
                "She was clear-headed, sensible, modest, perfectly balanced, and never\nworried about anything: for she always lived in and for the present,\nwithout bothering her head about what had happened or what was going to\nhappen in the future. And as she was always well, and as her life was\ncomparatively secure from the sudden turns of fate, she was almost\nalways satisfied. She took the same pleasure in practising her piano as\nin keeping house, or talking about things domestic, or doing nothing.\nShe had the art of living, not from day to day--(she was economical and\nprovident)--but from minute to minute. She was not possessed of any sort\nof idealism: the only ideal she had, if it could be called so, was\nbourgeois, and was unostentatiously expressed in her every action, and\nevenly distributed through every moment of the day: it consisted in\npeacefully loving everything she was doing, whatever it might be. She\nwent to church on Sundays: but the feeling of religion had practically\nno place in her life. She admired enthusiasts, like Christophe, who had\nfaith or genius: but she did not envy them: what could she have done\nwith their uneasiness and their genius?\n",
                "How came it, then, that she could feel their music? She would have found\nit hard to say. But it was very certain that she did feel it. She was\nsuperior to other virtuosi by reason of her sturdy quality of balance,\nphysical and moral: in her abounding vitality, in the absence of\npersonal passion, the passions of others found a rich soil in which to\ncome to flower. She was not touched by them. She could translate in all\ntheir energy the terrible passions which had consumed the artist without\nbeing tainted by their poison: she only felt their force and the great\nweariness that came after its expression. When it was over, she would be\nall in a sweat, utterly exhausted: she would smile calmly and feel very\nhappy.\n",
                "Christophe heard her one evening, and was struck by her playing. He went\nand shook hands with her after the concert. She was grateful to him for\nit: there were very few people at the concert, and she was not so used\nto compliments as to take no delight in them. As she had never been\nclever enough to throw in her lot with any musical coterie, or cunning\nenough to surround herself with a group of worshipers, and as she never\nattempted to make herself particular, either by technical mannerisms or\nby a fantastic interpretation of the hallowed compositions, or by\nassuming an exclusive right to play some particular master, such as\nJohann Sebastian Bach, or Beethoven, and as she had no theories about\nwhat she played, but contented herself with playing simply what she\nfelt--nobody paid any attention to her, and the critics ignored her: for\nnobody told them that she played well, and they were not likely to find\nit out for themselves.\n",
                "Christophe saw a good deal of C\u00e9cile. Her strength and tranquillity\nattracted him as a mystery. She was vigorous and apathetic. In his\nindignation at her not being better known he proposed that he should get\nhis friends of the _Grand Journal_ to write about her. But although\nshe would have liked to be praised, she begged him not to do anything to\nprocure it. She did not want to have the struggle or the bother or the\njealousies it would entail: she wanted to be left in peace. She was not\ntalked about: so much the better! She was not envious, and she was the\nfirst to be enthusiastic about the technique of other virtuosi. She had\nno ambition, and no desire for anything. She was much too lazy in mind!\nWhen she had not any immediate and definite work to do, she did nothing,\nnothing; she did not even dream, not even at night, in bed: she either\nslept or thought of nothing. She had not the morbid preoccupation with\nmarriage, which poisons the lives of girls who shiver at the thought of\ndying old maids. When she was asked if she would not like to have a\nhusband, she would say:\n",
                "\"Why not throw in fifty thousand a year? One has to take what comes. If\nany one offers, so much the better! If not, one goes without. Because\none can't have cake, I don't see why one shouldn't be glad of honest\nbread. Especially when one has had to eat stale bread for so long!\"\n",
                "\"Besides,\" her mother would say, \"there are plenty of people who never\nget any bread to eat at all!\"\n",
                "C\u00e9cile had good reason to fight shy of men. Her father, who had been\ndead some years, was a weak, lazy creature: he had wronged his wife and\nhis family. She had also a brother who had turned out badly and did not\nknow what had become of him: every now and then he would turn up and ask\nfor money: she and her mother were afraid of him and ashamed of him, and\nfearful of what they might hear about him any day: and yet they loved\nhim. Christophe met him once. He was at C\u00e9cile's house: there was a ring\nat the door: and her mother answered it. He heard a conversation being\ncarried on in the next room, and the voices were raised every now and\nthen. C\u00e9cile seemed ill at ease, and went out also, leaving Christophe\nalone. The discussion went on, and the stranger's voice assumed a\nthreatening tone: Christophe thought it time to intervene, and opened\nthe door. He hardly had time to do more than catch a glimpse of a young\nand slightly deformed man, whose back was turned towards him, for C\u00e9cile\nrushed towards him and implored him to go back. She went with him, and\nthey sat in silence. In the next room the visitor went on shouting for a\nfew minutes longer, and then took his leave and slammed the door. Then\nC\u00e9cile sighed, and said to Christophe:\n",
                "\"Yes.... He is my brother.\"\n",
                "Christophe understood:\n",
                "\"Ah!\" he said.... \"I know.... I have a brother, too....\"\n",
                "C\u00e9cile took his hand with an air of affectionate commiseration:\n",
                "\"You too?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" he said.... \"These are the joys of a family.\"\n",
                "C\u00e9cile laughed, and they changed the conversation. No, the joys of a\nfamily had no enchantment for her, nor had the idea of marriage any\nfascination: men were rather a worthless lot on the whole. Her\nindependent life had many advantages: her mother had often sighed after\nher liberty: she had no desire to lose it. The only day-dream in which\nshe indulged was that some day--Heaven knows when!--she would not have\nto give lessons any more, and would be able to live in the country. But\nshe did not even take the trouble to imagine such a life in detail: she\nfound it too fatiguing to think of anything so uncertain: it was better\nto sleep,--or do her work....\n",
                "In the meanwhile, in default of her castle in Spain, she used to hire a\nlittle house in the outskirts of Paris for the summer, and lived there\nwith her mother. It was twenty minutes' journey by train. The house was\nsome distance away from the station, standing alone in the midst of a\nstretch of waste lands which were called \"fields,\" and C\u00e9cile used often\nto return late at night. But she was not afraid, and did not believe\nthere was any danger. She had a revolver, but she always used to leave\nit at home. Besides, it was doubtful if she would have known how to use\nit.\n",
                "Sometimes, when he went to see her, Christophe would make her play. It\namused him to see her keen perception of the music, especially when he\nhad dropped a hint which put her on the track of a feeling that called\nfor expression. He had discovered that she had an excellent voice, but\nshe had no idea of it. He made her practise it, and would give her old\nGerman _lieder_ or his own music to sing: it gave her pleasure, and\nshe made such progress as to surprise herself as much as him. She was\nmarvelously gifted. The fire of music had miraculously descended upon\nthis daughter of Parisian middle-class parents who were utterly devoid\nof any artistic feeling. Philomela--(for so he used to call her)--used\nsometimes to discuss music with Christophe, but always in a practical,\nnever in a sentimental, way: she seemed only to be interested in the\ntechnique of singing and the piano. Generally, when they were together\nand were not playing music, they talked of the most commonplace things,\nand Christophe, who could not for a moment have tolerated such\nconversations with an ordinary woman, would discuss these subjects as a\nmatter of course with Philomela.\n",
                "They used to spend whole evenings alone together, and were genuinely\nfond of each other, though their affection was perfectly calm and even\nalmost cold. One evening, when he had dined with her, and had stayed\ntalking longer than usual, a violent storm came on: she said:\n",
                "\"You can't go now! Stay until to-morrow morning.\"\n",
                "He was fitted up with an improvised bed in the little sitting-room. Only\na thin partition was between it and C\u00e9cile's bedroom, and the doors were\nnot locked. As he lay there he could hear her bed creaking and her soft,\nregular breathing. In five minutes she was asleep: and very soon he\nfollowed her example without either of them having had the faintest\nshadow of an uneasy thought.\n",
                "At the same time there came into his life a number of other unknown\nfriends, drawn to him by reading his works. Most of them lived far away\nfrom Paris or shut up in their homes, and never met him. Even a vulgar\nsuccess does a certain amount of good: it makes the artist known to\nthousands of good people in remote corners whom he could never have\nreached without the stupid articles in the papers. Christophe entered\ninto correspondence with some of them. There were lonely young men,\nliving a life of hardship, their whole being aspiring to an ideal of which\nthey were not sure, and they came greedily to slake their thirst\nat the well of Christophe's brotherly spirit. There were humble people\nin the provinces who read his _lieder_ and wrote to him, like old\nSchulz, and felt themselves one with him. There were poor artists,--a\ncomposer among others,--who had not, and could not attain, not only\nsuccess, but self-expression, and it made them glad to have their ideas\nrealized by Christophe. And dearest of all, perhaps,--there were those\nwho wrote to him without giving their names, and, being thus more free\nto speak, naively laid bare their touching confidence in the elder\nbrother who had come to their assistance. Christophe's heart would grow\nbig at the thought that he would never know these charming people whom\nit would have given him such joy to love: he would kiss some of these\nanonymous letters as the writers of them kissed his _lieder_; and\neach to himself would think:\n",
                "\"Dear written sheets, what a deal of good you have done me!\"\n",
                "So, according with the unvaried rhythm of the universe, there was formed\nabout him the little family of genius, grouped about him, giving him\nfood and taking it from him, which grows little by little, and in the\nend becomes one great collective soul, of which he is the central fire,\nlike a gleaming world, a moral planet moving through space, mingling its\nchorus of brotherhood with the harmony of the spheres.\n",
                "And as these mysterious links were forged between Christophe and his\nunseen friends, a revolution took place in his artistic faculty: it\nbecame larger and more human. He lost all interest in music which was a\nmonologue, a soliloquy, and even more so in music which was a scientific\nstructure built entirely for the interest of the profession. He wished\nhis music to be an act of communion with other men. There is no vital\nart save that which is linked with the rest of humanity. Johann Sebastian\nBach, even in his darkest hours of isolation, was linked with the rest\nof humanity by his religious faith, which he expressed in his art.\nHandel and Mozart, by dint of circumstances, wrote for an audience, and\nnot for themselves. Even Beethoven had to reckon with the multitude. It\nis salutary. It is good for humanity to remind genius every now and then:\n",
                "\"What is there for us in your art? If there is nothing, out you go!\"\n",
                "In such constraint genius is the first to gain. There are, indeed, great\nartists who express only themselves. But the greatest of all are those\nwhose hearts beat for all men. If any man would see the living God face\nto face, he must seek Him, not in the empty firmament of his own brain,\nbut in the love of men.\n",
                "The artists of that time were far removed from that love. They wrote\nonly for a more or less anarchical and vain group, uprooted from the\nlife of the country, who preened themselves on not sharing the\nprejudices and passions of the rest of humanity, or else made a mock of\nthem. It is a fine sort of fame that is won by self-amputation from\nlife, so as to be unlike other men! Let all such artists perish! We will\ngo with the living, be suckled at the breasts of the earth, and drink in\nall that is most profound and sacred in our people, and all its love\nfrom the family and the soil. In the greatest age of liberty, among the\npeople with the most ardent worship of beauty, the young Prince of the\nItalian Renaissance, Raphael, glorified maternity in his transteverine\nMadonnas. Who is there now to give us in music a _Madonna \u00e0 la\nChaise?_ Who is there to give us music meet for every hour of life?\nYou have nothing, you have nothing in France. When you want to give your\npeople songs, you are reduced to bringing up to date the German masters\nof the past. In your art, from top to bottom, everything remains to be\ndone, or to be done again....\n",
                "Christophe corresponded with Olivier, who was now settled in a provincial\ntown. He tried to maintain in correspondence that collaboration which had\nbeen so fruitful during the time when they had lived together. He wanted\nhim to write him fine poetic words closely allied with the thoughts and\ndeeds of everyday life, like the poems which are the substance of the old\nGerman _lieder_. Short fragments from the Scriptures and the Hindoo poems,\nand the old Greek philosophers, short religious and moral poems, little\npictures of Nature, the emotions of love or family life, the whole poetry\nof morning, evening, and night, that is in simple, healthy people. Four\nlines or six are enough for a _lied_: only the simplest expressions, and\nno elaborate development or subtlety of harmony. What have I to do with\nyour esthetic tricks? Love my life, help me to love it and to live it.\nWrite me the _Hours of France_, my _Great_ and _Small Hours_. And let us\ntogether find the clearest melody. Let us avoid like the plague any\nartistic language that belongs to a caste like that of so many writers,\nand especially of so many French musicians of to-day. We must have the\ncourage to speak like men, and not like \"artists.\" We must draw upon the\ncommon fund of all men, and unashamedly make use of old formulae, upon\nwhich the ages have set their seal, formulas which the ages have filled\nwith their spirit. Look at what our forefathers have done. It was by\nreturning to the musical language of all men that the art of the German\nclassics of the eighteenth century came into being. The melodies of Gluck\nand the creators of the symphony are sometimes trivial and commonplace\ncompared with the subtle and erudite phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach and\nRameau. It is their raciness of the soil that gives such zest to, and has\nprocured such immense popularity for the German classics. They began with\nthe simplest musical forms, the _lied_ and the _Singspiel_, the little\nflowers of everyday life which impregnated the childhood of men like\nMozart and Weber.--Do you do the same. Write songs for all and sundry.\nUpon that basis you will soon build quartettes and symphonies. What is\nthe good of rushing ahead? The pyramids were not begun at the top. Your\nsymphonies at present are trunkless heads, ideas without any stuffing.\nOh, you fair spirits, become incarnate! There must be generations of\nmusicians patiently and joyously and piously living in brotherhood with\nthese people. No musical art was ever built in a day.\n",
                "Christophe was not content to apply these principles in music: he urged\nOlivier to set himself at the head of a similar movement in literature:\n",
                "\"The writers of to-day,\" he said, \"waste their energy in describing\nhuman rarities, or cases that are common enough in the abnormal groups\nof men and women living on the fringe of the great society of active,\nhealthy human beings. Since they themselves have shut themselves off\nfrom life, leave them and go where there are men. Show the life of every\nday to the men and women of every day: that life is deeper and more vast\nthan the sea. The smallest among you bears the infinite in his soul. The\ninfinite is in every man who is simple enough to be a man, in the lover,\nin the friend, in the woman who pays with her pangs for the radiant\nglory of the day of childbirth, in every man and every woman who lives\nin obscure self-sacrifice which will never be known to another soul: it\nis the very river of life, flowing from one to another, from one to\nanother, and back again and round.... Write the simple life of one of\nthese simple men, write the peaceful epic of the days and nights\nfollowing, following one like to another, and yet all different, all\nsons of the same mother, from the dawning of the first day in the life\nof the world. Write it simply, as simple as its own unfolding. Waste no\nthought upon the word, and the letter, and the subtle vain researches in\nwhich the force of the artists of to-day is turned to nought. You are\naddressing all men: use the language of all men. There are no words\nnoble or vulgar; there is no style chaste or impure: there are only\nwords and styles which say or do not say exactly what they have to say.\nBe sound and thorough in all you do: think just what you think,--and\nfeel just what you feel. Let the rhythm of your heart prevail in your\nwritings! The style is the soul.\"\n",
                "Olivier agreed with Christophe, but he replied rather ironically:\n",
                "\"Such a book would be fine: but it would never reach the people who\nwould care to read it. The critics would strangle it on the way.\"\n",
                "\"There speaks my little French bourgeois!\" replied Christophe. \"Worrying\nhis mind about what the critics will or will not think of his work!...\nThe critics, my boy, are only there to register victory or defeat. The\ngreat thing is to be victor.... I have managed to get along without\nthem! You must learn how to disregard them, too....\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "But Olivier had learned how to disregard something entirely different!\nHe had turned aside from art, and Christophe, and everybody. At that\ntime he was thinking of nothing but Jacqueline, and Jacqueline was\nthinking of nothing but him.\n",
                "The selfishness of their love had cut them off from everything and\neverybody: they were recklessly destroying all their future resources.\n",
                "They were in the blind wonder of the first days, when man and woman,\njoined together, have no thought save that of losing themselves in each\nother.... With every part of themselves, body and soul, they touch and\ntaste and seek to probe into the very inmost depths. They are alone\ntogether in a lawless universe, a very chaos of love, when the confused\nelements know not as yet what distinguishes one from the other, and\nstrive greedily to devour each other. Each in other finds nothing save\ndelight: each in other finds another self. What is the world to them?\nLike the antique Androgyne slumbering in his dream of voluptuous and\nharmonious delights, their eyes are closed to the world, All the world\nis in themselves....\n",
                "O days, O nights, weaving one web of dreams, hours fleeting like the\nfloating white clouds in the heavens, leaving nought but a shimmering\nwake in dazzled eyes, the warm wind breathing the languor of spring, the\ngolden warmth of the body, the sunlit arbor of love, shameless chastity,\nembraces, and madness, and sighs, and happy laughter, happy tears, what\nis there left of the lovers, thrice happy dust? Hardly, it seems, that\ntheir hearts could ever remember to beat: for when they were one then\ntime had ceased to exist.\n",
                "And all their days are one like unto another.... Sweet, sweet dawn....\nTogether, embracing, they issue from the abyss of sleep: they smile\nand their breath is mingled, their eyes open and meet, and they kiss....\nThere is freshness and youth in the morning hours, a virgin air\ncooling their fever.... There is a sweet languor in the endless day\nstill throbbing with the sweetness of the night.... Summer\nafternoons, dreams in the fields, on the velvety sward, beneath the\nrustling of the tall white poplars.... Dreams in the lovely evenings,\nwhen, under the gleaming sky, they return, clasping each other, to the\nhouse of their love. The wind whispers in the bushes. In the clear lake\nof the sky hovers the fleecy light of the silver moon. A star falls and\ndies,--hearts give a little throb--a world is silently snuffed out.\nSwift silent shadows pass at rare intervals on the road near by. The\nbells of the town ring in the morrow's holiday. They stop for a moment,\nshe nestles close to him, they stand so without a word.... Ah! if only\nlife could be so forever, as still and silent as that moment!... She\nsighs and says:\n",
                "\"Why do I love you so much?...\"\n",
                "After a few weeks' traveling in Italy they had settled in a town in the\nwest of France, where Olivier had gained an appointment. They saw hardly\nanybody. They took no interest in anything. When they were forced to pay\ncalls, their scandalous indifference was so open that it hurt some,\nwhile it made others smile. Anything that was said to them simply made\nno impression. They had the impertinently solemn manner common to young\nmarried people, who seem to say:\n",
                "\"You people don't know anything at all....\"\n",
                "Jacqueline's pretty pouting face, with its absorbed expression,\nOlivier's happy eyes that looked so far away, said only:\n",
                "\"If you knew how boring we find you!... When shall we be left alone?\"\n",
                "Even the presence of others could not embarrass them. It was hard not to\nsee their exchange of glances as they talked. They did not need to look\nto see each other: and they would smile: for they knew that they were\nthinking of the same things at the same time. When they were alone once\nmore, after having suffered the constraint of the presence of others,\nthey would shout for joy--indulge in a thousand childish pranks. They\nwould talk baby-language, and find grotesque nicknames for each other.\nShe used to call him Olive, Olivet, Olifant, Fanny, Mami, Mime, Minaud,\nQuinaud, Kaunitz, Cosima, Cobourg, Panot, Nacot, Ponette, Naquet, and\nCanot. She would behave like a little girl; but she wanted to be all\nthings at once to him, to give him every kind of love: mother, sister,\nwife, sweetheart, mistress.\n",
                "It was not enough for her to share his pleasures: as she had promised\nherself, she shared his work: and that, too, was a game. At first she\nbrought to bear on it the amused ardor of a woman to whom work is\nsomething new: she seemed really to take a pleasure in the most\nungrateful tasks, copying in the libraries, and translating dull books:\nit was part of her plan of life, that it should be pure and serious, and\nwholly consecrated to noble thoughts and work in common. And all went\nwell as long as the light of love was in them: for she thought only of\nhim, and not of what she was doing. The odd thing was that everything\nshe did in that way was well done. Her mind found no difficulty in\ntaking in abstract ideas, which at any other time of her life she would\nhave found it hard to follow: her whole being was, as it were, uplifted\nfrom the earth by love; she did not know it; like a sleep-walker moving\neasily over roofs, gravely and gaily, without seeing anything at all,\nshe lived on in her dream....\n",
                "And then she began to see the roofs: but that did not give her any\nqualms: only she asked what she was doing so high up, and became herself\nagain. Work bored her. She persuaded herself that it stood in the way of\nher love: no doubt because her love had already become less ardent. But\nthere was no evidence of that. They could not bear to be out of each\nother's sight. They shut themselves off from the world, and closed their\ndoors and refused all invitations. They were jealous of the affections\nof other people, even of their occupations, of everything which\ndistracted them from their love. Olivier's correspondence with\nChristophe dwindled. Jacqueline did not like it: he was a rival to her,\nrepresenting a part of Olivier's past life in which she had had no\nshare; and the more room he filled in Olivier's life, the more she\nsought, instinctively, to rob him of it. Without any deliberate\nintention, she gradually and steadily alienated Olivier from his friend:\nshe made sarcastic comments on Christophe's manners, his face, his way\nof writing, his artistic projects: there was no malice in what she said,\nnor slyness: she was too good-natured for that. Olivier was amused by\nher remarks, and saw no harm in them: he thought he still loved\nChristophe as much as ever, but he loved only his personality: and that\ncounts for very little in friendship: he did not see that little by\nlittle he was losing his understanding of him, and his interest in his\nideas, and the heroic idealism in which they had been so united.... Love\nis too sweet a joy for the heart of youth: compared with it, what other\nfaith can hold its ground? The body of the beloved and the soul that\nbreathes in it are all science and all faith. With what a pitying smile\ndoes a lover regard the object of another's adoration and the things\nwhich he himself once adored! Of all the might of life and its bitter\nstruggles the lover sees nothing but the passing flower, which he\nbelieves must live forever.... Love absorbed Olivier. In the beginning\nhis happiness was not so great but it left him with the energy to\nexpress it in graceful verse. Then even that seemed vain to him: it was\na theft of time from love. And Jacqueline also set to work to destroy\ntheir every source of life, to kill the tree of life, without the\nsupport of which the ivy of love must die. Thus in their happiness they\ndestroyed each other.\n",
                "Alas! we so soon grow used to happiness! When selfish happiness is the\nsole aim of life, life is soon left without an aim. It becomes a habit,\na sort of intoxication which we cannot do without. And how vitally\nimportant it is that we should do without it.... Happiness is an instant\nin the universal rhythm, one of the poles between which the pendulum of\nlife swings: to stop the pendulum it must be broken....\n",
                "They knew the \"boredom of well-being which sets the nerves on edge.\"\nTheir hours of sweetness dragged, drooped, and withered like flowers\nwithout water. The sky was still blue for them, but there was no longer\nthe light morning breeze. All was still: Nature was silent. They were\nalone, as they had desired.--And their hearts sank.\n",
                "An indefinable feeling of emptiness, a vague weariness not without a\ncertain charm, came over them. They knew not what it was, and they were\ndarkly uneasy. They became morbidly sensitive. Their nerves, strained in\nthe close watching of the silence, trembled like leaves at the least\nunexpected clash of life. Jacqueline was often in tears without any\ncause for weeping, and although she tried hard to convince herself of\nit, it was not only love that made them flow. After the ardent and\ntormented years that had preceded her marriage the sudden stoppage of\nher efforts as she attained--attained and passed--her end,--the sudden\nfutility of any new course of action--and perhaps of all that she had\ndone in the past,--flung her into a state of confusion, which she could\nnot understand, so that it appalled and crushed her. She would not allow\nthat it was so: she attributed it to her nerves, and pretended to laugh\nit off: but her laughter was no less uneasy than her tears. She tried\nbravely to take up her work again: but as soon as she began she could\nnot understand how she could ever have taken any interest in such stupid\nthings, and she flung them aside in disgust. She made an effort to pick\nup the threads of her social life once more: but with no better success:\nshe had committed herself, and she had lost the trick of dealing with\nthe commonplace people and their commonplace remarks that are inevitable\nin life: she thought them grotesque; and she flung back into her\nisolation with her husband, and tried hard to persuade herself, as a\nresult of these unhappy experiences, that there was nothing good in the\nworld save love. And for a time she seemed really to be more in love\nthan ever. Olivier, being less passionate and having a greater store of\ntenderness, was less susceptible to these apprehensions: only every now\nand then he would feel a qualm of uneasiness. Besides, his love was\npreserved in some measure by the constraint of his daily occupation, his\nwork, which was distasteful to him. But as he was highly strung and\nsensitive, and everything that happened in the heart of the woman he\nloved affected him also, Jacqueline's secret uneasiness infected him.\n",
                "One fine afternoon they went for a walk together in the country. They\nhad looked forward to the walk eagerly and happily. All the world was\nbright and gay about them. But as soon as they set out gloom and heavy\nsadness descended upon them: they felt chilled to the heart. They could\nfind nothing to say to each other. However, they forced themselves to\nspeak, but every word they said rang hollowly, and made them feel the\nemptiness of their lives at that moment. They finished their walk\nmechanically, seeing nothing, feeling nothing. They returned home sick\nat heart. It was twilight: their rooms were cold, black, and empty. They\ndid not light up at once, to avoid seeing each other. Jacqueline went\ninto her room, and, instead of taking off her hat and cloak, she sat in\nsilence by the window. Olivier sat, too, in the next room with his arms\nresting on the table. The door was open between the two rooms; they were\nso near that they could have heard each other's breathing. And in the\nsemi-darkness they both wept, in silence, bitterly. They held their\nhands over their mouths, so that they should make no sound. At last, in\nagony, Olivier said:\n",
                "\"Jacqueline....\"\n",
                "Jacqueline gulped down her sobs, and said:\n",
                "\"What is it?\"\n",
                "\"Aren't you coming?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I'm coming.\"\n",
                "She took off her hat and cloak, and went and bathed her eyes. He lit the\nlamp. In a few minutes she came into the room. They did not look at each\nother. Each knew that the other had been weeping. And they could not\nconsole each other, for they knew not why it was.\n",
                "Then came a time when they could no longer conceal their unhappiness.\nAnd as they would not admit the true cause of it, they cast about for\nanother, and had no difficulty in finding it. They set it down to the\ndullness of provincial life and their surroundings. They found comfort\nin that. M. Langeais was informed of their plight by his daughter, and\nwas not greatly surprised to hear that she was beginning to weary of\nheroism. He made use of his political friends, and obtained a post in\nParis for his son-in-law.\n",
                "When the good news reached them, Jacqueline jumped for joy and regained\nall her old happiness. Now that they were going to leave it, they found\nthat they were quite fond of the dull country: they had sown so many\nmemories of love in it! They occupied their last days in going over the\ntraces of their love. There was a tender melancholy in their pilgrimage.\nThose calm stretches of country had seen them happy. An inward voice\nmurmured:\n",
                "\"You know what you are leaving behind you. Do you know what lies before\nyou?\"\n",
                "Jacqueline wept the day before they left. Olivier asked her why. She\nwould not say. They took a sheet of paper, and as they always did when\nthey were fearful of the sound of words, wrote:\n",
                "\"My dear, dear Olivier....\"\n",
                "\"My dear, dear Jacqueline....\"\n",
                "\"I am sorry to be going away.\"\n",
                "\"Going away from what?\"\n",
                "\"From the place where we have been lovers.\"\n",
                "\"Going where?\"\n",
                "\"To a place where we shall be older.\"\n",
                "\"To a place where we shall be together.\"\n",
                "\"But never so loving.\"\n",
                "\"Always more loving.\"\n",
                "\"Who can tell?\"\n",
                "\"I know.\"\n",
                "\"I will be.\"\n",
                "Then they drew two circles at the bottom of the paper for kisses. And\nthen she dried her tears, laughed, and dressed him up as a favorite of\nHenri III by putting her toque on his head and her white cape with its\ncollar turned up like a ruff round his shoulders.\n",
                "In Paris they resumed all their old friendships, but they did not find\ntheir friends just as they had left them. When he heard of Olivier's\narrival, Christophe rushed to him delightedly. Olivier was equally\nrejoiced to see him. But as soon as they met they felt an unaccountable\nconstraint between them. They both tried to break through it, but in\nvain. Olivier was very affectionate, but there was a change in him, and\nChristophe felt it. A friend who marries may do what he will: he cannot\nbe the friend of the old days. The woman's soul is, and must be, merged\nin the man's. Christophe could detect the woman in everything that\nOlivier said and did, in the imperceptible light of his expression, in\nthe unfamiliar turn of his lips, in the new inflections of his voice and\nthe trend of his ideas. Olivier was oblivious of it: but he was amazed\nto find Christophe so different from the man he had left. He did not go\nso far as to think that it was Christophe who had changed: he recognized\nthat the change was in himself, and ascribed it to normal evolution, the\ninevitable result of the passing years; and he was surprised not to find\nthe same progress in Christophe: he thought reproachfully that he had\nremained stationary in his ideas, which had once been so dear to him,\nthough now they seemed na\u00efve and out of date. The truth was that they\ndid not sort well with the stranger soul which, unknown to himself, had\ntaken up its abode in him. He was most clearly conscious of it when\nJacqueline was present when they were talking: and then between\nOlivier's eyes and Christophe there was a veil of irony. However, they\ntried to conceal what they felt. Christophe went often to see them, and\nJacqueline innocently let fly at him her barbed and poisoned shafts. He\nsuffered her. But when he returned home he would feel sad and sorry.\n",
                "Their first months in Paris were fairly happy for Jacqueline, and\nconsequently for Olivier. At first she was busy with their new house:\nthey had found a nice little flat looking on to a garden in an old\nstreet at Passy. Choosing furniture and wallpapers kept her time full\nfor a few weeks. Jacqueline flung herself into it energetically, and\nalmost passionately and exaggeratedly: it was as though her eternal\nhappiness depended on the color of her hangings or the shape of an old\nchest. Then she resumed intercourse with her father and mother and her\nfriends. As she had entirely forgotten them during her year of love, it\nwas as though she had made their acquaintance for the first time: just\nas part of her soul was merged in Olivier's, so part of Olivier's soul was\nmerged in hers, and she saw her old friends with new eyes. They\nseemed to her to have gained much. Olivier did not lose by it at first.\nThey were a set-off to each other. The moral reserve and the poetic\nlight and shade of her husband made Jacqueline find more pleasure in\nthose worldly people who only think of enjoying themselves, and of being\nbrilliant and charming: and the seductive but dangerous failings of\ntheir world, which she knew so much better because she belonged to it,\nmade her appreciate the security of her lover's affection. She amused\nherself with these comparisons, and loved to linger over them, the\nbetter to justify her choice.--She lingered over them to such an extent\nthat sometimes she could not tell why she had made that choice. Happily,\nsuch moments never lasted long. She would be sorry for them, and was\nnever so tender with Olivier as when they were past. Thereupon she would\nbegin again. By the time it had become a habit with her it had ceased to\namuse her: and the comparison became more aggressive: instead of\ncomplementing each other, the two opposing worlds declared war on each\nother. She began to wonder why Olivier lacked the qualities, if not some\nof the failings, which she now admired in her Parisian friends. She did\nnot tell him so: but Olivier often felt his wife looking at him without\nany indulgence in her eyes, and it hurt him and made him uneasy.\n",
                "However, he had not lost the ascendancy over Jacqueline which love had\ngiven him: and they would have gone on quite happily living their life\nof tender and hard-working intimacy for long enough had it not been for\ncircumstances which altered their material condition and destroyed its\ndelicate balance.\n",
                "_Quivi trovammo Pluto il gran n\u00e9mico...._\n",
                "A sister of Madame Langeais died. She was the widow of a rich\nmanufacturer, and had no children. Her whole estate passed to the\nLangeais. Jacqueline's fortune was more than doubled by it. When she\ncame in for her legacy, Olivier remembered what Christophe had said\nabout money, and remarked:\n",
                "\"We were quite well off without it: perhaps it will be a bad thing for\nus.\"\n",
                "Jacqueline laughed at him:\n",
                "\"Silly!\" she said. \"As though money could ever do any harm! We won't\nmake any change in our way of living just yet.\"\n",
                "Their life remained the same to all appearances: so much the same that\nafter a certain time Jacqueline began to complain that they were not\nwell enough off: proof positive that there was a change somewhere. And,\nin fact, although their income had been doubled or tripled, they spent\nthe whole of it without knowing how they did it. They began to wonder\nhow they had managed to live before. The money flew, and was swallowed\nup by a thousand new expenses, which seemed at once to be habitual and\nindispensable. Jacqueline had begun to patronize the great dressmakers:\nshe had dismissed the family sempstress who came by the day, a woman she\nhad known since she was a child. The days of the little fourpenny hats\nmade out of nothing, though they were quite pretty all the same, were\ngone,--gone the days of the frocks which were not impeccably smart,\nthough they had much of her own grace, and were, indeed, a part of\nherself! The sweet intimate charm which shone upon all about her grew\nfainter every day. The poetry of her nature was lost. She was becoming\ncommonplace.\n",
                "They changed their flat. The rooms which they had furnished with so much\ntrouble and pleasure seemed narrow and ugly. Instead of the cozy little\nrooms, all radiant with her spirit, with a friendly tree waving its\ndelicate foliage against the windows, they took an enormous,\ncomfortable, well-arranged flat which they did not, could not, love,\nwhere they were bored to death. Instead of their old friendly\nbelongings, they obtained furniture and hangings which were strangers to\nthem. There was no place left for memories. The first years of their\nmarried life were swept away from their thoughts.... It is a great\nmisfortune for two people living together to have the ties which bind\nthem to their past love broken! The image of their love is a safeguard\nagainst the disappointment and hostility which inevitably succeed the\nfirst years of tenderness.... The power to spend largely had brought\nJacqueline, both in Paris and abroad--(for now that they were rich they\noften traveled)--into touch with a class of rich and useless people,\nwhose society gave her a sort of contempt for the rest of mankind, all\nthose who had work to do. With her marvelous power of adaptation, she\nvery quickly caught the color of these sterile and rotten men and women.\nShe could not fight against it. At once she became refractory and\nirritable, regarding the idea that it was possible--and right--to be\nhappy in her domestic duties and the _aur\u00e9a mediocritus_ as mere\n\"vulgar manners.\" She had lost even the capacity to understand the\nbygone days when she had so generously given herself in love.\n",
                "Olivier was not strong enough to fight against it. He, too, had changed.\nHe had given up his work, and had no fixed and compulsory occupation. He\nwrote, and the balance of his life was adjusted by it. Till then he had\nsuffered because he could not give his whole life to art. Now that he\ncould do so he felt utterly lost in the cloudy world. Art which is not also\na profession, and supported by a healthy practical life, art which\nknows not the necessity of earning the daily bread, loses the best part\nof its force and its reality. It is only the flower of luxury. It is\nnot--(what in the greatest, the only great, artists it is)--the sacred\nfruit of human suffering.--Olivier felt a disinclination to work, a\ndesire to ask: \"What is the good of it?\" There was nothing to make him\nwrite: he would let his pen run on, he dawdled about, he had lost his\nbearings. He had lost touch with his own class of men and women\npatiently plowing the hard furrow of their lives. He had fallen into a\ndifferent world, where he was ill at ease, though on the whole he did\nnot find it unpleasant. Weak, amiable, and curious, he fell complacently\nto observing that world which was entirely lacking in consistency,\nthough it was not without charm; and he did not see that little by\nlittle he was becoming contaminated by it: it was undermining his faith.\n",
                "No doubt the transformation was not so rapid in him as it was in\nJacqueline.--Women have the terrible privilege of being able suddenly to\nundergo a complete change. The way in which they suddenly die and then\nas suddenly come to life again is appalling to those who love them. And\nyet it is perfectly natural for a human being who is full of life\nwithout the curb of the will not to be to-morrow what it is to-day. A\nwoman is like running water. The man who loves her must follow the\nstream or divert it into the channel of his own life. In both cases\nthere must be change. But it is a dangerous experience, and no man\nreally knows love until he has gone through it. And its harmony is so\ndelicate during the first years of married life that often the very\nsmallest change in either husband or wife is enough to destroy their\nwhole relationship. How much more perilous, then, is a sudden change of\nfortune or of circumstance! They must needs be very strong--or very\nindifferent to each other--to withstand it.\n",
                "Jacqueline and Olivier were neither indifferent nor strong. They began\nto see each other in a new light: and the face of the beloved became\nstrange to them. When first they made the sad discovery, they hid it\nfrom each other in loving pity: for they still loved each other. Olivier\ntook refuge in his work, and by applying himself to it regularly, though\nwith even less conviction than before, won through to tranquillity.\nJacqueline had nothing. She did nothing. She would stay in bed for\nhours, or dawdle over her toilette, sitting idly, half dressed,\nmotionless, lost in thought: and gradually a dumb misery crept over her\nlike an icy mist. She could not break away from the fixed idea of\nlove.... Love! Of things human the most Divine when it is the gift of\nself, a passionate and blind sacrifice. But when it is no more than the\npursuit of happiness, it is the most senseless and the most elusive....\nIt was impossible for her to conceive any other aim in life. In moments\nof benevolence she had tried to take an interest in the sorrows of other\npeople: but she could not do it. The sufferings of others filled her\nwith an ungovernable feeling of repulsion: her nerves were not strong\nenough to bear them. To appease her conscience she had occasionally done\nsomething which looked like philanthropy: but the result had been tame\nand disappointing.\n",
                "\"You see,\" she would say to Christophe, \"when one tries to do good one\ndoes harm. It is much better not to try. I'm not cut out for it.\"\n",
                "Christophe would look at her: and he would think of a girl he had met, a\nselfish, immoral little grisette, absolutely incapable of real\naffection, though, as soon as she saw anybody suffering, she was filled\nwith motherly pity for him, even though she had not cared a rap for him\nbefore, even though he were a stranger to her. She was not abashed by\nthe most horrible tasks, and she would even take a strange pleasure in\ndoing those which demanded the greatest self-denial. She never stopped\nto think about it: she seemed to find in it a use for her obscure,\nhereditary, and eternally unexpressed idealism: her soul was atrophied\nas far as the rest of her life was concerned, but at such rare moments\nit breathed again: it gave her a sense of well-being and inward joy to\nbe able to allay suffering: and her joy was then almost misplaced.--The\ngoodness of that woman, who was selfish, the selfishness of Jacqueline,\nwho was good in spite of it, were neither vice nor virtue, but in both\ncases only a matter of health. But the first was in the better case.\nJacqueline was crushed by the mere idea of suffering. She would have\npreferred death to physical illness. She would have preferred death to\nthe loss of either of her sources of joy: her beauty or her youth. That\nshe should not have all the happiness to which she thought herself\nentitled,--(for she believed in happiness, it was a matter of faith with\nher, wholeheartedly and absurdly, a religious belief),--and that others\nshould have more happiness than herself, would have seemed to her the\nmost horrible injustice. Happiness was not only a religion to her; it\nwas a virtue. To be unhappy seemed to her to be an infirmity. Her whole\nlife gradually came to revolve round that principle. Her real character\nhad broken through the veils of idealism in which in girlish bashful\nmodesty she had enshrouded herself. In her reaction against the idealism\nof the past she began to see things in a hard, crude light. Things were\nonly true for her in proportion as they coincided with the opinion of\nthe world and the smoothness of life. She had reached her mother's state\nof mind: she went to church, and practised religion punctiliously and\nindifferently. She never stopped to ask herself whether there was any\nreal truth in it: she had other more positive mental difficulties: and\nshe would think of the mystical revolt of her childhood with pitying\nirony.--And yet her new positivism was no more real than her old\nidealism. She forced it. She was neither angel nor brute. She was just a\npoor bored woman.\n",
                "She was bored, bored, bored: and her boredom was all the greater in that\nshe could not excuse herself on the score of not being loved, or by\nsaying that she could not endure Olivier. Her life seemed to be stunted,\nwalled up, with no future prospect: she longed for a new happiness that\nshould be perpetually renewed; her longing was utterly childish, for it\nnever took into account her indifferent capacity for happiness. She was\nlike so many women living idle lives with idle husbands, who have every\nreason to be happy, and yet never cease torturing themselves. There are\nmany such couples, who are rich and blessed with health and lovely\nchildren, and clever and capable of feeling fine things, and possessed\nof the power to keep themselves employed and to do good, and to enrich\ntheir own lives and the lives of others. And they spend their time in\nmoaning and groaning that they do not love each other, that they love\nsome one else, or that they do not love somebody else--perpetually taken\nup with themselves, and their sentimental or sensual relations, and\ntheir pretended right to happiness, their conflicting egoism, and\narguing, arguing, arguing, playing with their sham grand passion, their\nsham great suffering, and in the end believing in it, and--suffering....\nIf only some one would say to them:\n",
                "\"You are not in the least interesting. It is indecent to be so sorry for\nyourselves when you have so many good reasons for being happy!\"\n",
                "If only some one would take away their money, their health, all the\nmarvelous gifts of which they are so unworthy! If only some one would\nonce more lay the yoke of poverty and real suffering on these slaves who\nare incapable of being free and are driven mad by their liberty! If they\nhad to earn their bread in the sweat of their brows, they would be glad\nenough to eat it. And if they were to come face to face with grim\nsuffering, they would never dare to play with the sham....\n",
                "But, when all is said and done, they do suffer. They are ill. How, then,\nare they not to be pitied?--Poor Jacqueline was quite innocent, as\ninnocent in drifting apart from Olivier as Olivier was in not holding\nher. She was what Nature had made her. She did not know that marriage is\na challenge to Nature, and that, when one has thrown down the gauntlet\nto Nature, it is only to be expected that she will arise and begin\nvaliantly to wage the combat which one has provoked. She saw that she\nhad been mistaken, and she was exasperated with herself; and her\ndisillusion turned to hostility towards the thing she had loved,\nOlivier's faith, which had also been her own. An intelligent woman has,\nmuch more than a man, moments of an intuitive perception of things\neternal: but it is more difficult for her to maintain her grip on them.\nOnce a man has come by the idea of the eternal, he feeds it with his\nlife-blood. A woman uses it to feed her own life: she absorbs it, and\ndoes not create it. She must always be throwing fresh fuel into her\nheart and mind: she cannot be self-sufficing. And if she cannot believe\nand love, she must destroy--except she possess the supreme virtue of\nserenity.\n",
                "Jacqueline had believed passionately in a union based on a common faith,\nin the happiness of struggling and suffering together in accomplishment.\nBut she had only believed in that endeavor, that faith, while they were\ngilded by the sun of love: and as the sun died down she saw them as\nbarren, gloomy mountains standing out against the empty sky: and her\nstrength failed her, so that she could go no farther on the road: what\nwas the good of reaching the summit? What was there on the other side?\nIt was a gigantic phantom and a snare!... Jacqueline could not\nunderstand how Olivier could go on being taken in by such fantastic\nnotions which consumed life: and she began to tell herself that he was\nnot very clever, nor very much alive. She was stifling in his\natmosphere, in which she could not breathe, and the instinct of\nself-preservation drove her on to the attack, in self-defense. She\nstrove to scatter and bring to dust the injurious beliefs of the man she\nstill loved: she used every weapon of irony and seductive pleasure in\nher armory: she trammeled him with the tendrils of her desires and her\npetty cares: she longed to make him a reflection of herself, ...\nherself who knew neither what she wanted nor what she was! She was\nhumiliated by Olivier's want of success: and she did not care whether it\nwere just or unjust; for she had come to believe that the only thing\nwhich saves a man of talent from failure is success. Olivier was\noppressed by his consciousness of her doubts, and his strength was\nsapped by it. However, he struggled on as best he could, as so many men\nhave struggled, and will struggle, for the most part vainly, in the\nunequal conflict in which the selfish instinct of the woman upholds\nitself against the man's intellectual egoism by playing upon his\nweakness, his dishonesty, and his common sense, which is the name with\nwhich he disguises the wear and tear of life and his own cowardice.--At\nleast, Jacqueline and Olivier were better than the majority of such\ncombatants. For he would never have betrayed his ideal, as thousands of\nmen do who drift with the demands of their laziness, their vanity, and\ntheir loves, into renunciation of their immortal souls. And, if he had\ndone so, Jacqueline would have despised him. But, in her blindness, she\nstrove to destroy that force in Olivier, which was hers also, their common\nsafeguard: and by an instinctive strategical movement she undermined the\nfriendship by which that force was upheld.\n",
                "Since the legacy Christophe had become a stranger in their household.\nThe affectation of snobbishness and a dull practical outlook on life\nwhich Jacqueline used wickedly to exaggerate in her conversations with\nhim were more than he could bear. He would lash out sometimes, and say\nhard things, which were taken in bad part. They could never have brought\nabout a rupture between the two friends: they were too fond of each\nother. Nothing in the world would have induced Olivier to give up\nChristophe. But he could not make Jacqueline feel the same about him;\nand, his love making him weak, he was incapable of hurting her.\nChristophe, who saw what was happening to him, and how he was suffering,\nmade the choice easy by a voluntary withdrawal. He saw that he could not\nhelp Olivier in any way by staying, but rather made things worse. He was\nthe first to give his friend reasons for turning from him: and Olivier,\nin his weakness, accepted those inadequate reasons, while he guessed\nwhat the sacrifice must have cost Christophe, and was bitterly sorry for\nit.\n",
                "Christophe bore him no ill-will. He thought that there was much truth in\nthe saying that a man's wife is his better half. For a man married is\nbut the half of a man.\n",
                "He tried to reconstruct his life without Olivier. But it was all in\nvain, and it was idle for him to pretend that the separation would only\nbe for a short time: in spite of his optimism, he had many hours of\nsadness. He had lost the habit of loneliness. He had been alone, it is\ntrue, during Olivier's sojourn in the provinces: but then he had been\nable to pretend and tell himself that his friend was away for a time,\nand would return. Now that his friend had come back he was farther away\nthan ever. His affection for him, which had filled his life for a number\nof years, was suddenly taken from him: it was as though he had lost his\nchief reason for working. Since his friendship for Olivier he had grown\nused to thinking with him and bringing him into everything he did. His\nwork was not enough to supply the gap: for Christophe had grown used to\nweaving the image of his friend into his work. And now that his friend\nno longer took any interest in him, Christophe was thrown off his\nbalance: he set out to find another affection to restore it.\n",
                "Madame Arnaud and Philomela did not fail him. But just then such\ntranquil friendship as theirs was not enough. However, the two women\nseemed to divine Christophe's sorrow, and they secretly sympathized with\nhim. Christophe was much surprised one evening to see Madame Arnaud come\ninto his room. Till then she had never ventured to call on him. She\nseemed to be somewhat agitated. Christophe paid no heed to it, and set\nher uneasiness down to her shyness. She sat down, and for some time said\nnothing. To put her at her ease, Christophe did the honors of his room.\nThey talked of Olivier, with memories of whom the room was filled.\nChristophe spoke of him gaily and naturally, without giving so much as\na hint of what had happened. But Madame Arnaud, knowing it, could not help\nlooking at him pityingly and saying:\n",
                "\"You don't see each other now?\"\n",
                "He thought she had come to console him, and felt a gust of impatience,\nfor he did not like any meddling with his affairs. He replied:\n",
                "\"Whenever we like.\"\n",
                "She blushed, and said:\n",
                "\"Oh! it was not an indiscreet question!\"\n",
                "He was sorry for his gruffness, and took her hands:\n",
                "\"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"I am always afraid of his being blamed.\nPoor boy! He is suffering as much as I.... No, we don't see each other\nnow.\"\n",
                "\"And he doesn't write to you?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" said Christophe, rather shamefacedly....\n",
                "\"How sad life is!\" said Madame Arnaud, after a moment.\n",
                "\"No; life is not sad,\" he said. \"But there are sad moments in it.\"\n",
                "Madame Arnaud went on with veiled bitterness:\n",
                "\"We love, and then we love no longer. What is the good of it all?\"\n",
                "Christophe replied:\n",
                "\"It is good to have loved.\"\n",
                "She went on:\n",
                "\"You have sacrificed yourself for him. If only our self-sacrifice could\nbe of any use to those we love! But it makes them none the happier!\"\n",
                "\"I have not sacrificed myself,\" said Christophe angrily. \"And if I have,\nit is because it pleased me to do so. There's no room for arguing about\nit. One does what one has to do. If one did not do it, one would be\nunhappy, and suffer for it! There never was anything so idiotic as this\ntalk of sacrifice! Clergymen, in the poverty of their hearts, mix it up\nwith a cramped and morose idea of Protestant gloom. Apparently, if an\nact of sacrifice is to be good, it must be besotted.... Good Lord! if a\nsacrifice means sorrow to you, and not joy, then don't do it; you are\nunworthy of it. A man doesn't sacrifice himself for the King of Prussia,\nbut for himself. If you don't feel the happiness that lies in the gift\nof yourself, then get out! You don't deserve to live.\"\n",
                "Madame Arnaud listened to Christophe without daring to look at him.\nSuddenly she got up and said:\n",
                "\"Good-by.\"\n",
                "Then he saw that she had come to confide in him, and said:\n",
                "\"Oh! forgive me. I'm a selfish oaf, and can only talk about myself.\nPlease stay. Won't you?\"\n",
                "She said:\n",
                "\"No: I cannot.... Thank you....\"\n",
                "And she left him.\n",
                "It was some time before they met again. She gave no sign of life; and he\ndid not go to see either her or Philomela. He was fond of both of them:\nbut he was afraid of having to talk to them about things that made him\nsad. And, besides, for the time being, their calm, dull existence, with\nits too rarefied air, was not suited to his needs. He wanted to see new\nfaces; it was imperative that he should find a new interest, a new love,\nto occupy his mind.\n",
                "By way of being taken out of himself he began to frequent the theaters\nwhich he had neglected for a long time. The theater seemed to him to be\nan interesting school for a musician who wishes to observe and take note\nof the accents of the passions.\n",
                "It was not that he had any greater sympathy with French plays than when\nhe first came to live in Paris. Outside his small liking for their\neternal stale and brutal subjects connected with the psycho-physiology\nof love, it seemed to him that the language of the French theater,\nespecially in poetic drama, was ultra-false. Neither their prose nor\ntheir verse had anything in common with the living language and the\ngenius of the people. Their prose was an artificial language, the\nlanguage of a polite chronicle with the best, that of a vulgar\nfeuilletonist with the worst. Their poetry justified Goethe's gibe:\n",
                "\"_Poetry is all very well for those who have nothing to say_.\"\n",
                "It was a wordy and inverted prose: the profusion of metaphors clumsily\ntacked on to it in imitation of the lyricism of other nations produced\nan effect of utter falsity upon any sincere person. Christophe set no\nmore store by these poetic dramas than he did by the Italian operas with\ntheir shrill mellifluous airs and their ornamental vocal exercises. He\nwas much more interested in the actors than the plays. And the authors\nhad tried hard to imitate them. \"_It was hopeless to think that a play\ncould be performed with any success unless the author had looked to it\nthat his characters were modeled on the vices of the actors_.\" The\nsituation was hardly at all changed since the time when Diderot wrote\nthose lines. The actors had become the models of the art of the theater.\nAs soon as any one of them reached success, he had his theater, his\ncompliant tailor-authors, and his plays made to measure.\n",
                "Among these great mannikins of literary fashions Fran\u00e7oise Oudon\nattracted Christophe. Paris had been infatuated with her for a couple of\nyears or so. She, too, of course, had her theater and her purveyors of\nparts: however, she did not only act in plays written for her: her mixed\nrepertory ranged from Ibsen to Sardou, from Gabriele d'Annunzio to Dumas\n_fils_, from Bernard Shaw to the latest Parisian playwrights. Upon\noccasion she would even venture into the Versailles' avenues of the\nclassic hexameter, or on to the deluge of images of Shakespeare. But she\nwas ill at ease in that galley, and her audience was even more so.\nWhatever she played, she played herself, nothing but herself, always. It\nwas both her weakness and her strength. Until the public had been\nawakened to an interest in her personality, her acting had had no\nsuccess. As soon as that interest was roused, everything she did\nappeared marvelous. And, indeed, it was well worth while in watching her\nto forget the usually pitiful plays which she betrayed by endowing and\nadorning them with her vitality. The mystery of the woman's body, swayed\nby a stranger soul, was to Christophe far more moving than the plays in\nwhich she acted.\n",
                "She had a fine, clear-cut, rather tragic profile. She had not the marked\nheavy lines of the Roman style: on the contrary, her lines were delicate\nand Parisian, _\u00e0 la _Jean Goujon--as much like a boy's as a\nwoman's. A short, finely-modeled nose. A beautiful mouth, with thin\nlips, curling rather bitterly. Bright cheeks, girlishly thin, in which\nthere was something touching, the light of inward suffering. A strong\nchin. Pale complexion. One of those habitually impassive faces which are\ntransparent in spite of themselves, and reveal the soul quivering behind\nit, as though it were exposed in its nakedness; one of those faces in\nwhich the soul seems to be ever, in every part of it, just beneath the\nskin. She had very fine hair and eyebrows, and her changing eyes were\ngray and amber-colored, passing quickly from one light to another,\ngreenish and golden, like the eyes of a cat. And there was something\ncatlike in all her nature, in her apparent torpor, her semi-somnolence,\nwith eyes wide open, always on the watch, always suspicious, while\nsuddenly she would nervously and rather cruelly relax her watchfulness.\nShe was not so tall as she appeared, nor so slender; she had beautiful\nshoulders, lovely arms, and fine, long hands. She was very neat in her\ndress, and her coiffure, always trim and tasteful, with none of the\nBohemian carelessness or the exaggerated smartness of many artists--even\nin that she was catlike, instinctively aristocratic, although she had\nrisen from the gutter. At bottom she was incurably shy and wild.\n",
                "She must have been a little less than thirty. Christophe had heard\npeople speak of her at Gamache's with coarse admiration, as a woman of\ngreat freedom, intelligence, and boldness, tremendous and inflexible\nenergy, and burning ambition, but bitter, fantastic, perplexing, and\nviolent, a woman who had waded through a deal of mud before she had\nreached her present pinnacle of fame, and had since avenged herself.\n",
                "One day, when Christophe was going by train to see Philomela at Meudon,\nas he opened the door of a compartment, he saw the actress sitting\nthere. She seemed to be agitated and perturbed, and Christophe's\nappearance annoyed her. She turned her back on him, and looked\nobstinately out of the opposite window. But Christophe was so struck by\nthe changed expression in her face, that he could not stop gazing at her\nwith a na\u00efve and embarrassing compassion. It exasperated her, and she\nflung an angry look at him which he did not understand. At the next\nstation she got out and went into another compartment. Then for the\nfirst time it occurred to him--rather late in the day--that he had\ndriven her away: and he was greatly distressed. A few days later, at a\nstation on the same line, he was sitting on the only seat in the\nplatform, waiting for the train back to Paris. She appeared, and came\nand sat by his side. He began to move, but she said:\n",
                "\"Stay.\"\n",
                "They were alone. He begged her pardon for having forced her to go to\nanother compartment the other day, saying that if he had had any idea\nthat he was incommoding her he would have got out himself. She smiled\nironically, and only replied:\n",
                "\"You were certainly unbearable with your persistent staring.\"\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"I begged your pardon: I could not help it.... You looked so unhappy.\"\n",
                "\"Well, what of it?\" she said.\n",
                "\"It was too strong for me. If you saw a man drowning, wouldn't you hold\nout your hand to him?\"\n",
                "\"I? Certainly not,\" she said. \"I would push him under water, so as to\nget it over quickly.\"\n",
                "She spoke with a mixture of bitterness and humor: and, when he looked at\nher in amazement, she laughed.\n",
                "The train came in. It was full up, except for the last carriage. She got\nin. The porter told them to hurry up. Christophe, who had no mind to\nrepeat the scene of a few days before, was for finding another\ncompartment, but she said:\n",
                "\"Come in.\"\n",
                "He got in, and she said:\n",
                "\"To-day I don't mind.\"\n",
                "They began to talk. Christophe tried very seriously to prove to her that\nit was not right not to take an interest in others, and that people\ncould do so much for each other by helping and comforting each other....\n",
                "\"Consolation,\" she said, \"is not much in my line....\"\n",
                "And as Christophe insisted:\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said, with her impertinent smile; \"the part of comforter is\nall very well for the man who plays it.\"\n",
                "It was a moment or two before he grasped her meaning. When he\nunderstood, when he fancied that she suspected him of seeking his own\ninterest, while he was only thinking of her, he got up indignantly and\nopened the door, and made as though to climb out, although the train was\nmoving. She prevented him, though not without difficulty. He sat down\nagain angrily, and shut the door just as the train shot into a tunnel.\n",
                "\"You see,\" she said, \"you might have been killed.\"\n",
                "\"I don't care,\" he said.\n",
                "He refused to speak to her again.\n",
                "\"People are so stupid,\" he said. \"They make each other suffer, they\nsuffer, and when a man goes to help another fellow-creature, he is\nsuspected. It is disgusting. People like that are not human.\"\n",
                "She laughed and tried to soothe him. She laid her gloved hand on his:\nshe spoke to him gently, and called him by his name.\n",
                "\"What?\" he said. \"You know me?\"\n",
                "\"As if everybody didn't know everybody in Paris! We're all in the same\nboat. But it was horrid of me to speak to you as I did. You are a good\nfellow. I can see that. Come; calm yourself. Shake hands! Let us make\npeace!\"\n",
                "They shook hands, and went on talking amicably. She said:\n",
                "\"It is not my fault, you know. I have had so many experiences with men\nthat I have become suspicious.\"\n",
                "\"They have deceived me, too, many a time,\" said Christophe. \"But I\nalways give them credit for something better.\"\n",
                "\"I see; you were born to be gulled.\"\n",
                "He began to laugh:\n",
                "\"Yes; I've been taken in a good many times in my life; I've gulped down\na good many lies. But it does me no harm. I've a good stomach. I can put\nup with worse things, hardship, poverty, and, if necessary, I can gulp\ndown with their lies the poor fools who attack me. It does me good, if\nanything.\"\n",
                "\"You're in luck,\" she said. \"You're something like a man.\"\n",
                "\"And you. You're something like a woman.\"\n",
                "\"That's no great thing.\"\n",
                "\"It's a fine thing,\" he said, \"and it may be a good thing, too!\"\n",
                "She laughed:\n",
                "\"To be a woman!\" she said. \"But what does the world make of women?\"\n",
                "\"You have to defend yourself.\"\n",
                "\"But goodness never lasts long.\"\n",
                "\"Then you can't have much of it.\"\n",
                "\"Possibly. And then, I don't think one ought to suffer too much. There\nis a point beyond which suffering withers you up.\"\n",
                "He was just about to tell her how he pitied her, but he remembered how\nshe had received it a short while before....\n",
                "\"You'll only talk about the advantages of the part of comforter....\"\n",
                "\"No,\" she said, \"I won't say it again. I feel that you are kind and\nsincere. Thank you. Only, don't say anything. You cannot know.... Thank\nyou.\"\n",
                "They had reached Paris. They parted without exchanging addresses or\ninviting each other to call.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "A few months later she came of her own accord and knocked at\nChristophe's door.\n",
                "\"I came to see you. I want to talk to you. I have been thinking of you\nsometimes since our meeting.\"\n",
                "She took a seat.\n",
                "\"Only for a moment. I shan't disturb you for long.\"\n",
                "He began to talk to her. She said:\n",
                "\"Wait a moment, please.\"\n",
                "They sat in silence. Then she said with a smile:\n",
                "\"I couldn't bear it any longer. I feel better now.\"\n",
                "He tried to question her.\n",
                "\"No,\" she said. \"Not that!\"\n",
                "She looked round the room, examined and appraised the things in it, and\nsaw the photograph of Louisa:\n",
                "\"Your mother?\" she said.\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "She took it and looked at it sympathetically.\n",
                "\"What a good old woman!\" she said. \"You are lucky!\"\n",
                "\"Alas! she is dead.\"\n",
                "\"That is nothing. You have had the luck to have her for your mother.\"\n",
                "\"Yes. And you?\"\n",
                "But she turned the subject with a frown. She would not let him question\nher about herself.\n",
                "\"No; tell me about yourself. Tell me.... Something about your life....\"\n",
                "\"How can it be of any interest to you?\"\n",
                "\"Tell me, all the same....\"\n",
                "He would not tell her: but he could not avoid answering her questions,\nfor she cross-examined him very skilfully: so much so, that he told her\nsomething of what he was suffering, the story of his friendship, and how\nOlivier had left him. She listened with a pitying ironical smile....\nSuddenly she asked:\n",
                "\"What time is it? Oh! good Heavens! I've been here two whole hours!...\nPlease forgive me.... Ah! what a rest it has been!...\"\n",
                "She added:\n",
                "\"Will you let me come again?... Not often.... Sometimes.... It would do\nme good. But I wouldn't like to bore you or waste your time.... Only a\nminute or two every now and then....\"\n",
                "\"I'll come and see you,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"No, don't do that. I would much rather come to see you....\"\n",
                "But she did not come again for a long time. One evening he heard by\naccident that she was seriously ill, and had not been acting for some\nweeks. He went to see her, although she had forbidden it. She was not at\nhome: but when she heard who it was, she sent and had him brought back\nas he was going down the stairs. She was in bed, but much better: she\nhad had pneumonia, and looked altered: but she still had her ironical\nmanner and her watchful expression, which there was no disarming.\nHowever, she seemed to be really pleased to see Christophe. She made him\nsit by her bedside, and talked about herself in a mocking, detached way,\nand said that she had almost died. He was much moved, and showed it.\nThen she teased him. He reproached her for not having let him know.\n",
                "\"Let you know? And have you coming to see me? Never!\"\n",
                "\"I bet you never even thought of me.\"\n",
                "\"You've won,\" she said, with her sad little mocking smile. \"I didn't\nthink of you for a moment while I was ill. To be precise, I never\nthought of you until to-day. There's nothing to be glum about, come.\nWhen I am ill I don't think of anybody. I only ask one thing of people;\nto be left alone in peace. I turn my face to the wall and wait: I want\nto be alone. I want to die alone, like a rat in a hole.\"\n",
                "\"And yet it is hard to suffer alone.\"\n",
                "\"I'm used to it. I have been unhappy for years. No one ever came to my\nassistance. Now it has become a habit.... Besides, it is better so. No\none can do anything for you. A noise in the room, worrying attentions,\nhypocritical jeremiads.... No; I would rather die alone.\"\n",
                "\"You are very resigned!\"\n",
                "\"Resigned? I don't even know what the word means. No: I set my teeth and\nI hate the illness which makes me suffer.\"\n",
                "He asked her if she had no one to see her, no one to look after her. She\nsaid that her comrades at the theater were kind enough,--idiots,--but\nobliging and compassionate (in a superficial sort of way).\n",
                "\"But I tell you, I don't want to see them. I'm a surly sort of\ncustomer.\"\n",
                "\"I would put up with it,\" he said.\n",

                "He buried his face in the bedclothes. She laughed frankly, and gave him\na tap on the head!\n",
                "\"Ah! that's not Parisian! That's something like! I know you again. Come,\nshow your face. Don't weep all over my bed.\"\n",
                "\"Do you forgive me?\"\n",
                "\"I forgive you. But don't do it again.\"\n",
                "She talked to him a little more, asked him what he was doing, and was\nthen tired, bored, and dismissed him.\n",
                "He had arranged to go and see her again the following week. But just as\nhe was setting out he received a telegram from her telling him not to\ncome: she was having a bad day.--Then, the next day but one, she sent\nfor him. He went, and found her convalescent, sitting by the window,\nwith her feet up. It was early spring, with a sunny sky and the young\nbuds on the trees. She was more gentle and affectionate than he had yet\nseen her. She told him that she could not see anybody the other day, and\nwould have detested him as much as anybody else.\n",
                "\"And to-day?\"\n",
                "\"To-day I feel young and fresh, and I feel fond of everything else about\nme that feels young and fresh--as you do.\"\n",
                "\"And yet I am neither very young nor very fresh.\"\n",
                "\"You will be both until the day of your death.\"\n",
                "They talked about what he had been doing since their last meeting, and\nabout the theater in which she was going to resume her work soon: and on\nthat she told him what she thought of the theater, which disgusted her,\nwhile it held her in its grip.\n",
                "She did not want him to come again, and promised to resume her visits to\nhis flat. He told her the times when she would be least likely to\ndisturb his work. They arranged a countersign. She was to knock at the\ndoor in a certain way, and he was to open or not as he felt inclined....\n",
                "She did not go beyond bounds at first. But once, when she was going to a\nsociety At Home, where she was to recite, the idea of it bored her at\nthe last moment: she stopped on the way and telephoned to say that she\ncould not come, and she told her man to drive to Christophe's. She only\nmeant to say good-night to him as she passed. But, as it turned out, she\nbegan to confide in him that night, and told him all her life from her\nchildhood on.\n",
                "A sad childhood! An accidental father whom she had never known. A mother\nwho kept an ill-famed inn in a suburb of a town in the north of France:\nthe carters used to go and drink there, use the proprietress, and bully\nher. One of them married her because she had some small savings: he used\nto beat her and get drunk. Fran\u00e7oise had an elder sister who was a\nservant in the inn: she was worked to death; the proprietor made her his\nmistress in the sight and knowledge of her mother; she was consumptive,\nand had died. Fran\u00e7oise had grown up amid scenes of violence and\nshameful things. She saw her mother and sister weep, suffer, accept,\ndegrade themselves, and die. And desperately she made up her mind not to\nsubmit to it, and to escape from her infamous surroundings: she was a\nrebel by instinct: certain acts of injustice would set her beside\nherself: she used to scratch and bite when she was thrashed. Once she\ntried to hang herself. She did not succeed: she had hardly set about it\nthan she was afraid lest she might succeed only too well; and, even\nwhile she was beginning to choke and desperately clutching at the rope\nand trying to loosen it with stiff fumbling fingers, there was writhing\nin her a furious desire to live. And since she could not escape by\ndeath,--(Christophe smiled sadly, remembering his own experiences,)--she\nswore that she would win, and be free, rich, and trample under foot all\nthose who oppressed her. She had made it a vow in her lair one evening,\nwhen in the next room she could hear the oaths of the man, and the cries\nof her mother as he beat her, and her sister's sobs. How utterly\nwretched she felt! And yet her vow had been some solace. She clenched\nher teeth and thought:\n",
                "\"I will crush the lot of you.\"\n",
                "In that dark childhood there had been one ray of light:\n",
                "One day, one of the little grubby boys with whom she used to lark in the\ngutter, the son of the stage-door keeper of the theater, got her in to\nthe rehearsal, although it was strictly forbidden. They stole to the\nvery back of the building in the darkness. She was gripped by the\nmystery of the stage, gleaming in the darkness, and by the magnificent\nand incomprehensible things that the actors were saying, and by the\nqueenly bearing of the actress,--who was, in fact, playing a queen in a\nromantic melodrama. She was chilled by emotion: and at the same time her\nheart thumped.... \"That--that is what I must be some day!\" ... Oh! if\nshe could ever be like that!...--When it was over she wanted at all\ncosts to see the evening performance. She let her companion go out, and\npretended to follow him: and then she turned back and hid herself in the\ntheater: she cowered away under a seat, and stayed there for three hours\nwithout stirring, choked by the dust: and when the performance was about\nto begin and the audience was arriving, just as she was creeping out of\nher hiding-place, she had the mortification of being pounced on,\nignominiously expelled amid jeers and laughter, and taken home, where\nshe was whipped. She would have died that night had she not known now\nwhat she must do later on to master these people and avenge herself on\nthem.\n",
                "Her plan was made. She took a situation as a servant in the _H\u00f4tel et\nCaf\u00e9 du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre_, where the actors put up. She could hardly read or\nwrite: and she had read nothing, for she had nothing to read. She wanted\nto learn, and applied herself to it with frantic energy. She used to\nsteal books from the guests' rooms, and read them at night by moonlight\nor at dawn, so as not to use her candle. Thanks to the untidiness of the\nactors, her larcenies passed unnoticed or else the owners put up with\ncursing and swearing. She used to restore their books when she had read\nthem,--except one or two which had moved her too much for her to be able\nto part with them;--but she did not return them intact. She used to tear\nout the pages which had pleased her. When she took the books back, she\nused carefully to slip them under the bed or the furniture, so as to\nmake the owners of them believe that they had never left the room. She\nused to glue her ears to the door to listen to the actors going over\ntheir parts. And when she was alone, sweeping the corridor, she would\nmimic their intonations in a whisper and gesticulate. When she was\ncaught doing so she was laughed at and jeered at. She would say nothing,\nand boil with rage.--That sort of education might have gone on for a\nlong time had she not on one occasion been imprudent enough to steal the\nscript of a part from the room of an actor. The actor stamped and swore.\nNo one had been to his room except the servant: he accused her. She\ndenied it boldly: he threatened to have her searched: she threw herself\nat his feet and confessed everything, even to her other pilferings and\nthe pages she had torn out of the books: the whole boiling. He cursed\nand swore frightfully: but he was not so angry as he seemed. He asked\nwhy she had done it. When she told him that she wanted to become an\nactress he roared with laughter. He questioned her, and she recited\nwhole pages which she had learned by heart: he was struck by it, and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"Look here, would you like me to give you lessons?\"\n",
                "She was in the highest heaven of delight, and kissed his hands.\n",
                "\"Ah!\" she said to Christophe, \"how I should have loved him!\"\n",
                "But at once he added:\n",
                "\"Only, my dear, you know you can't have anything for nothing....\"\n",
                "She was chaste, and had always been scared and modest with those who had\npursued her with their overtures. Her absolute chastity, her ardent need\nof purity, her disgust with things unclean and ignoble loveless\nsensuality, had been with her always from her childhood on, as a result\nof the despair and nausea of the sad sights which she saw about her on\nall sides at home:--and they were with her still.... Ah! unhappy\ncreature! She had borne much punishment!... What a mockery of Fate!...\n",
                "\"Then,\" asked Christophe, \"you consented?\"\n",
                "\"Ah!\" she said, \"I would have gone through fire to get out of it. He\nthreatened to have me arrested as a thief. I had no choice.--That was\nhow I was initiated into art--and life.\"\n",
                "\"The blackguard!\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"Yes, I hated him. But I have met so many men since that he does not\nseem to me to be one of the worst. He did at least keep his word. He\ntaught me what he knew--(not much!)--of the actor's trade. He got me\ninto his company. At first I was everybody's servant, I played little\nscraps of parts. Then one night, when the soubrette was ill, they risked\ngiving me her part. I went on from that. They thought me impossible,\ngrotesque, uncouth. I was ugly then. I remained ugly until I was\ndecreed,--if not 'divine' like the other Woman,--the highest, the ideal\ntype of woman, ... 'Woman.' ... Idiots! As for my acting, it was thought\nextravagant and incorrect. The public did not like me. The other players\nused to make fun of me. I was kept on because I was useful in spite of\neverything, and was not expensive. Not only was I not expensive, but I\npaid! Ah! I paid for every step, every advance, rung by rung, with my\nsuffering, with my body. Fellow-actors, the manager, the impresario, the\nimpresario's friends....\"\n",
                "She stopped: her face was very pale, her lips were pressed together,\nthere was a hard stare in her eyes: no tears came, but it was plain to\nsee that her soul was shedding tears of blood. In a flash she was living\nthrough the shameful past, and the consuming desire to conquer which had\nupheld her--a desire that burned the more with every fresh stain and\ndegradation that she had had to endure. She would sometimes have been\nglad to die: but it would have been too abominable to succumb in the\nmidst of humiliation and to go no farther. Better to take her life\nbefore--if so it must be--or after victory. But not when she had\ndegraded herself and not enjoyed the price of it....\n",
                "She said no more. Christophe was pacing up and down the room in anger:\nhe was in a mood to slay these men who had made this woman suffer and\nbesmirched her. Then he looked at her with the eyes of pity: and he\nstood near her and took her face in his hands and pressed it fondly, and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"Poor little woman!\"\n",
                "She made to thrust him away. He said:\n",
                "\"You must not be afraid of me. I love you.\"\n",
                "Then the tears trickled down her pale cheeks. He knelt down by her and\nkissed--\n",
                "  \"_La lunga man d'ogni bellezza piena_....\"\n",
                "--the long delicate hands on which two tears had fallen.\n",
                "He sat down again, and she recovered herself and calmly went on with her\nstory:\n",
                "An author had at last launched her. He had discovered in the strange\nlittle creature a daimon, a genius,--and, even better for his purpose,\n\"a dramatic type, a new woman, representative of an epoch.\" Of course,\nhe made her his mistress after so many others had done the same. And she\nlet him take her, as she had suffered the others, without love, and even\nwith the opposite of love. But he had made her famous: and she had done\nthe same for him.\n",
                "\"And now,\" said Christophe, \"the others cannot do anything to you: you\ncan do what you like with them.\"\n",
                "\"You think so?\" she said bitterly.\n",
                "Then she told him of Fate's other mockery,--her passion for a knave whom\nshe despised: a literary man who had exploited her, had plucked out the\nmost sorrowful secrets of her soul, and turned them into literature, and\nthen had left her.\n",
                "\"I despise him,\" she said, \"as I despise the dirt on my boots: and I\ntremble with rage when I think that I love him, that he has but to hold\nup his finger, and I should go running to him, and humble myself before\nsuch a cur. But what can I do? I have a heart that will never love what\nmy mind desires. And I am compelled alternately to sacrifice and\nhumiliate one or the other. I have a heart: I have a body. And they cry\nout and cry out and demand their share of happiness. And I have nothing\nto curb them with, for I believe in nothing. I am free.... Free? I am\nthe slave of my heart and my body, which often, almost always, in spite\nof myself, desire and have their will. They carry me away, and I am\nashamed. But what can I do?...\"\n",
                "She stopped for a moment, and mechanically moved the cinders in the fire\nwith the tongs.\n",
                "\"I have read in books,\" she said, \"that actors feel nothing. And,\nindeed, those whom I meet are nearly all conceited, grown-up children\nwho are never troubled by anything but petty questions of vanity. I do\nnot know if it is they who are not true comedians, or myself. I fancy it\nmust be I. In any case, I pay for the others.\"\n",
                "She stopped speaking. It was three in the morning. She got up to go.\nChristophe told her to wait until the morning before she went home, and\nproposed that she should go and lie down on his bed. She preferred to\nstay in the arm-chair by the dead fire, and went on talking quietly\nwhile all the house was still.\n",
                "\"You will be tired to-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"I am used to it. But what about you?... What are you doing to-morrow?\"\n",
                "\"I am free. I have a lesson to give about eleven.... Besides, I am\nstrong.\"\n",
                "\"All the more reason why you should sleep soundly.\"\n",
                "\"Yes; I sleep like a log. Not even pain can stand out against it. I am\nsometimes furious with myself for sleeping so well. So many hours\nwasted!... I am delighted to be able to take my revenge on sleep for\nonce in a way, and to cheat it of a night.\"\n",
                "They went on talking in low tones, with long intervals of silence. And\nChristophe went to sleep. Fran\u00e7oise smiled and supported his head to\nkeep him from falling.... She sat by the window dreaming and looking\ndown into the darkness of the garden, which presently was lit up. About\nseven o'clock she woke Christophe gently, and said good-by.\n",
                "In the course of the month she came at times when Christophe was out,\nand found the door shut. Christophe sent her a key to the flat, so that\nshe could go there when she liked. She went more than once when\nChristophe was away, and she would leave a little bunch of violets on\nthe table, or a few words scribbled on a sheet of paper, or a sketch, or\na caricature--just to show that she had been.\n",
                "And one evening, when she left the theater, she went to the flat to\nresume their pleasant talk. She found him at work, and they began to\ntalk. But at the very outset they both felt that the friendly\ncomfortable mood of the last occasion was gone. She tried to go: but it\nwas too late. Not that Christophe did anything to prevent her. It was\nher own will that failed her and would not let her go. They stayed there\nwith the gathering consciousness of the desire that was in them.\n",
                "Following on that night she disappeared for some weeks. In him there had\nbeen roused a sensual ardor that had lain dormant for months before, and\nhe could not live without her. She had forbidden him to go to her house:\nhe went to see her at the theater. He sat far back, and he was aflame\nwith love and devotion: every nerve in his body thrilled: the tragic\nintensity which she brought to her acting consumed him also in its fire.\nAt last he wrote to her:\n",
                "\"My Dear,--Are you angry with me? Forgive me if I have hurt you.\"\nWhen she received his humble little note she hastened to him and flung\nherself into his arms.\n",
                "\"It would have been better to be just friends, good friends. But since\nit is impossible, it is no good holding out against the inevitable. Come\nwhat may!\"\n",
                "They lived together. They kept on in their separate flats, and each of\nthem was free. Fran\u00e7oise could not have submitted to living openly with\nChristophe. Besides, her position would not allow it. She used to go to\nChristophe's flat and spend part of the day and night with him; but she\nused to return to her own place every day and also sleep there.\n",
                "During the vacation, when the theater was closed, they took a house\ntogether outside Paris, near Gif. They had many happy days there, though\nthere were clouds of sadness too. They were days of confidence and work.\nThey had a beautiful light room, high up, with a wide view over the\nfields. At night through the window they could see the strange shadows\nof the clouds floating across the clear, dull darkness of the sky. Half\nasleep, they could hear the joyous crickets chirping and the showers\nfalling; the breath of the autumn earth--honeysuckle, clematis, glycine,\nand new-mown hay--filled the house and soothed their senses. The silence\nof the night. In the distance dogs barked. Cocks crowed. Dawn comes. The\ntinkling angelus rings in the distant belfry, through the cold, gray\ntwilight, and they shiver in the warmth of their nest, and yet more\nlovingly hold each other close. The voices of the birds awake in the\ntrellis on the wall. Christophe opens his eyes, holds his breath, and\nhis heart melts as he looks down at the dear tired face of his sleeping\nbeloved, pale with the paleness of love....\n",
                "Their love was no selfish passion. It was a profound love in\ncomradeship, in which the body also demanded its share. They did not\nhinder each other. They both went on with their work. Christophe's\ngenius and kindness and moral fiber were dear to Fran\u00e7oise. She felt\nolder than he in many ways, and she found a maternal pleasure in the\nrelation. She regretted her inability to understand anything he played:\nmusic was a closed book to her, except at rare moments, when she would\nbe overcome by a wild emotion, which came less from the music than from\nher own inner self, from the passion in which she was steeped at that\ntime, she and everything about her, the country, people, color, and\nsound. But she was none the less conscious of Christophe's genius,\nbecause it was expressed in a mysterious language which she did not\nunderstand. It was like watching a great actor playing in a foreign\nlanguage. Her own genius was rekindled by it. Christophe, thanks to\nlove, could project his ideas and body forth his passions in the mind of\nthe woman and her beloved person: they seemed to him more beautiful\nthere than they were in himself--endowed with an antique and seemingly\neternal beauty. Intimacy with such a soul, so feminine, so weak and kind\nand cruel, and genial in flashes, was a source of boundless wealth. She\ntaught him much about life, and men--about women, of whom he knew very\nlittle, while she judged them with swift, unerring perception. But\nespecially he was indebted to her for a better understanding of the\ntheater; she helped him to pierce through to the spirit of that\nadmirable art, the most perfect of all arts, the fullest and most sober.\nShe revealed to him the beauty of that magic instrument of the human\ndream,--and made him see that he must write for it and not for himself,\nas he had a tendency to do,--(the tendency of too many artists, who,\nlike Beethoven, refuse to write \"_for a confounded violin when the\nSpirit speaks to them_\").--A great dramatic poet is not ashamed to\nwork for a particular theater and to adapt his ideas to the actors at\nhis disposal: he sees no belittlement in that: but he knows that a vast\nauditorium calls for different methods of expression than those\nnecessary for a smaller space, and that a man does not write\ntrumpet-blares for the flute. The theater, like the fresco, is art\nfitted to its place. And therefore it is above all else the human art,\nthe living art.\n",
                "Fran\u00e7oise's ideas were in accordance with Christophe's, who, at that\nstage in his career, was inclined towards a collective art, in communion\nwith other men. Fran\u00e7oise's experience helped him to grasp the\nmysterious collaboration which is set up between the audience and the\nactor. Though Fran\u00e7oise was a realist, and had very few illusions, yet\nshe had a great perception of the power of reciprocal suggestion, the\nwaves of sympathy which pass between the actor and the multitude, the\ngreat silence of thousands of men and women from which arises the single\nvoice of their interpreter. Naturally she could only feel it in\nintermittent flashes, very, very rare, which were hardly ever reproduced\nat the same passages in the same play. For the rest her work was a\nsoulless trade, an intelligent and coldly mechanical routine. But the\ninterest of it lay in the exception--the flash of light which pierced\nthe darkness of the abyss, the common soul of millions of men and women\nwhose living force was expressed in her for the space of a second of\neternity.\n",
                "It was this common soul which it was the business of the great artist to\nexpress. His ideal should be a living objectivism, in which the poet\nshould throw himself into those for whom he sings, and denude himself of\nself, to clothe the collective passions which are blown over the world\nlike a mighty wind. Fran\u00e7oise was all the more keenly conscious of the\nnecessity, inasmuch as she was incapable of such disinterestedness, and\nalways played herself.--For the last century and a half the disordered\nefflorescence of individual lyricism has been tinged with morbidity.\nMoral greatness consists in feeling much and controlling much, in being\nsober in words and chaste in thought, in not making a parade of it, in\nmaking a look speak and speak profoundly, without childish exaggeration\nor effeminate effusiveness, to those who can grasp the half-spoken\nthought, to men. Modern music, which is so loquaciously introspective,\ndragging in indiscreet confidences at every turn, is immodest and\nlacking in taste. It is like those invalids who can think of nothing but\ntheir illnesses, and never weary of discussing them with other people\nand going into repulsive petty details. This travesty of art has been\ngrowing more and more prevalent for the last century. Fran\u00e7oise, who was\nno musician, was disposed to see a sign of decadence in the development\nof music at the expense of poetry, like a polypus sucking it dry.\nChristophe protested: but, upon reflection, he began to wonder whether\nthere might not be some truth in it. The first _lieder_ written to\npoems of Goethe were sober and apt: soon Schubert came and infused his\nromantic sentimentality into them and gave them a twist: Schumann\nintroduced his girlish languor: and, down to Hugo Wolf, the movement had\ngone on towards more stress in declamation, indecent analysis, a\npresumptuous endeavor to leave no smallest corner of the soul unlit.\nEvery veil about the mysteries of the heart was rent. Things said in all\nearnestness by a man were now screamed aloud by shameless girls who\nshowed themselves in their nakedness.\n",
                "Christophe was rather ashamed of such art, by which he was himself\nconscious of being contaminated: and, without seeking to go back to the\npast,--(an absurd, unnatural desire),--he steeped himself in the spirit\nof those of the masters of the past who had been haughtily discreet in\ntheir thought and had possessed the sense of a great collective art:\nlike Handel, who, scorning the tearful piety of his time and country,\nwrote his colossal _Anthems_ and his oratorios, those heroic epics\nwhich are songs of the nations for the nations. The difficulty was to\nfind inspiring subjects, which, like the Bible in Handel's time, could\narouse emotions common to all the nations of modern Europe. Modern\nEurope had no common book: no poem, no prayer, no act of faith which was\nthe property of all. Oh! the shame that should overwhelm all the\nwriters, artists, thinkers, of to-day! Not one of them has written, not\none of them has thought, for all. Only Beethoven has left a few pages of\na new Gospel of consolation and brotherhood: but only musicians can read\nit, and the majority of men will never hear it. Wagner, on the hill at\nBayreuth, has tried to build a religious art to bind all men together.\nBut his great soul had too little simplicity and too many of the\nblemishes of the decadent music and thought of his time: not the fishers\nof Galilee have come to the holy hill, but the Pharisees.\n",
                "Christophe felt sure what he had to do: but he had no poet, and he was\nforced to be self-sufficing and to confine himself to music. And music,\nwhatever people say, is not a universal language: the bow of words is\nnecessary to send the arrow of sound into the hearts of all men.\n",
                "Christophe planned to write a suite of symphonies inspired by everyday\nlife. Among others he conceived a Domestic Symphony, in his own manner,\nwhich was very different from that of Richard Strauss. He was not\nconcerned with materializing family life in a cinematograph picture, by\nmaking use of a conventional alphabet, in which musical themes expressed\narbitrarily the various characters whom, if the auditor's eyes and ears\ncould stand it, were presently to be seen going through divers\nevolutions together. That seemed to him a pedantic and childish game for\na great contrapuntist. He did not try to describe characters or actions,\nbut only to express emotions familiar to every man and woman, in which\nthey could find the echo of their own souls, and perhaps comfort and\nrelief. The first movement expressed the grave and simple happiness of a\nloving young couple, with its tender sensuality, its confidence in the\nfuture, its joy and hopes. The second movement was an elegy on the death\nof a child. Christophe had avoided with horror any effort to depict\ndeath, and realistic detail in the expression of sorrow: there was only\nthe utter misery of it,--yours, mine, everybody's, of being face to face\nwith a misfortune which falls or may fall to the lot of everybody. The\nsoul, prostrate in its grief, from which Christophe had banned the usual\neffects of sniveling melodrama, recovered bit by bit, in a sorrowful\neffort, to offer its suffering as a sacrifice to God. Once more it set\nbravely out on the road, in the next movement, which was linked with the\nsecond,--a headstrong fugue, the bold design and insistent rhythm of\nwhich captivated, and, through struggles and tears, led on to a mighty\nmarch, full of indomitable faith. The last movement depicted the evening\nof life. The themes of the opening movement reappeared in it with their\ntouching confidence and their tenderness which could not grow old, but\nriper, emerging from the shadow of sorrow, crowned with light, and, like\na rich blossoming, raising a religious hymn of love to life and God.\n",
                "Christophe also rummaged in the books of the past for great, simple,\nhuman subjects speaking to the best in the hearts of all men. He chose\ntwo such stories: _Joseph_ and _Niobe_. But then Christophe\nwas brought up not only against his need of a poet, but against the\nvexed question, which has been argued for centuries and never solved, of\nthe union of poetry and music. His talks with Fran\u00e7oise had brought him\nback to his idea, sketched out long ago with Corinne, of a form of\nmusical drama, somewhere between recitative opera and the spoken\ndrama,--the art of the free word united with free music,--an art of\nwhich hardly any artist of to-day has a glimmering, an art also which\nthe routine critics, imbued with the Wagnerian tradition, deny, as they\ndeny every really new work: for it is not a matter of following in the\nfootsteps of Beethoven, Weber, Schumann, Bizet, although they used the\nmelodramatic form with genius: it is not a matter of yoking any sort of\nspeaking voice to any sort of music, and producing, at all costs, with\nabsurd tremolos, coarse effects upon coarse audiences: it is a matter of\ncreating a new form, in which musical voices will be wedded to\ninstruments attuned to those voices, discreetly mingling with their\nharmonious periods the echo of dreams and the plaintive murmur of music.\nIt goes without saying that such a form could only be applied to a\nnarrow range of subjects, to intimate and introspective moments of the\nsoul, so as to conjure up its poetic perfume. In no art should there be\nmore discretion and aristocracy of feeling. It is only natural,\ntherefore, that it should have little chance of coming to flower in an\nage which, in spite of the pretensions of its artists, reeks of the\ndeep-seated vulgarity of upstarts.\n",
                "Perhaps Christophe was no more suited to such an art than the rest: his\nvery qualities, his plebeian force, were obstacles in the way. He could\nonly conceive it, and with the aid of Fran\u00e7oise realize a few rough\nsketches.\n",
                "In this way he set to music passages from the Bible, almost literally\ntranscribed,--like the immortal scene in which Joseph makes himself\nknown to his brothers, and, after so many trials, can no longer contain\nhis emotion and tender feeling, and whispers the words which have wrung\ntears from old Tolstoy, and many another:\n",
                "\"_Then Joseph could not refrain himself.... I am Joseph; doth my\nfather yet live? I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. I\nam Joseph...._\"\n",
                "Their beautiful and free relation could not last. They had moments\nsplendid and full of life: but they were too different. They were both\nstrong-willed, and then often clashed. But their differences were never\nof a vulgar character: for Christophe had won Fran\u00e7oise's respect. And\nFran\u00e7oise, who could sometimes be so cruel, was kind to those who were\nkind to her; no power on earth could have made her do anything to hurt\nthem. And besides, both of them had a fund of gay humor. She was always\nthe first to laugh at herself. She was still eating her heart out: for\nthe old passion still had its grip on her: she still thought of the\nblackguard she loved: and she could not bear to be in so humiliating a\nposition or, above all, to have Christophe suspecting what she was\nfeeling.\n",
                "Christophe would sometimes find her for days together silent and\nrestless and given up to melancholy, and could not understand how she\ncould be unhappy. She had achieved her end: she was a great artist,\nadmired, flattered....\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she would say; \"that would be all very well if I were one of\nthose famous actresses, with, no soul above shopkeeping, who run the\ntheater just as they would run any other business. They are quite happy\nwhen they have 'realized' a good position, a commonplace, wealthy\nmarriage, and--the _ne plus ultra_--been decorated. I wanted more\nthan that. Unless one is a fool, success is even more empty than\nfailure. You must know that!\"\n",
                "\"I know,\" said Christophe. \"Ah! Dear God, that is not what I imagined\nfame to be when I was a child. How I longed for it, and what a shining\nthing it seemed to be! It was almost a religion to me then.... No\nmatter! There is one divine virtue in success: the good it gives one the\npower to do.\"\n",
                "\"What good? One has conquered. But what's the good of it? Nothing is\naltered. Theaters, concerts, everything is just the same. A new fashion\nsucceeds the old: that is all. They do not understand one, or only\nsuperficially: and they begin to think of something else at once.... Do\nyou yourself understand other artists? In any case, they don't\nunderstand you. The people you love best are so far away from you! Look\nat your Tolstoy....\"\n",
                "Christophe had written to him: he had been filled with enthusiasm for\nhim, and had wept over his books: he wanted to set one of the peasant\ntales to music, and had asked for his authority, and had sent him his\n_lieder_. Tolstoy did not reply, any more than Goethe replied to\nSchubert or Berlioz when they sent him their masterpieces. He had had\nChristophe's music played to him, and it had irritated him: he could\nmake nothing of it. He regarded Beethoven as a decadent, and Shakespeare\nas a charlatan. On the other hand, he was infatuated with various little\npretty-pretty masters, and the harpsichord music which used to charm the\n_Roi-Perruque_: and he regarded _La Confession d'une Femme de\nChambre_ as a Christian book....\n",
                "\"Great men have no need of us,\" said Christophe. \"We must think of the\nothers.\"\n",
                "\"Who? The dull public, the shadows who hide life from us? Act, write for\nsuch people? Give your life for them? That would be bitter indeed!\"\n",
                "\"Bah!\" said Christophe. \"I see them as they are just as you do: but I\ndon't let it make me despondent. They are not as bad as you say.\"\n",
                "\"Dear old German optimist!\"\n",
                "\"They are men, like myself. Why should they not understand me?...--And\nsuppose they don't understand me, why should I despair? Among all the\nthousands of people there will surely be one or two who will be with me:\nthat is enough for me, and gives me window enough to breathe the outer\nair.... Think of all the simple playgoers, the young people, the old\nhonest souls, who are lifted out of their tedious everyday life by your\nappearance, your voice, your revelation of tragic beauty. Think of what\nyou were yourself when you were a child! Isn't it a fine thing to give\nto others--perhaps even only to one other--the happiness that others\ngave you, and to do to them the good that others did to you?\"\n",
                "\"Do you really believe that there is one such in the world? I have come\nto doubt it.... Besides, what sort of love do we get from the best of\nthose who love us? How do they see us? They see so badly! They admire\nyou while they degrade you: they get just as much pleasure out of\nwatching any old stager act: they drag you down to the level of the\nidiots you despise. In their eyes all successful people are exactly the\nsame.\"\n",
                "\"And yet, when all is told, it is the greatest of all who go down to\nposterity with the greatest.\"\n",
                "\"It is only the backward movement of time. Mountains grow taller the\nfarther you go away from them. You see their height better: but you are\nfarther away from them.... And besides, who is to tell us who are the\ngreatest? What do you know of the men who have disappeared?\"\n",
                "\"Nonsense!\" said Christophe. \"Even if nobody were to feel what I think\nand what I am, I think my thoughts and I am what I am just the same. I\nhave my music, I love it, I believe in it: it is the truest thing in my\nlife.\"\n",
                "\"You are free in your art,--you can do what you like. But what can I do?\nI am forced to act in the plays they give me, and go on acting until I\nam sick of it. We are not yet, in France, such beasts of burden as those\nAmerican actors who play _Rip_ or _Robert Macaire_ ten thousand times, and\nfor twenty-five years of their lives go on grinding out and grinding out\nan idiotic part. But we are on the road to it. Our theaters are so\npoverty-stricken! The public will only stand genius in infinitesimal\ndoses, sprinkled with mannerisms and fashionable literature.... A\n'fashionable genius'! Doesn't that make you laugh?... What waste of power!\nLook at what they have made of a Mounet. What has he had to play the whole\nof his life? Two or three parts that are worth the struggle for life: the\n_Oedipus_ and _Polyeucte_. The rest has been rot! Isn't that enough to\ndisgust one? And just think of all the great and glorious things he might\nhave had to do!... Things are no better outside France? What have they\nmade of a Duse? What has her life been given up to? Think of the futile\nparts she has played?\"\n",
                "\"Your real task,\" said Christophe, \"is to force great works of art on\nthe world.\"\n",
                "\"We should exhaust ourselves in a vain endeavor. It isn't worth it. As\nsoon as a great work of art is brought into the theater it loses its\ngreat poetic quality. It becomes a hollow sham. The breath of the public\nsullies it. The public consists of people living in stifling towns and\nthey have lost all knowledge of the open air, and Nature, and healthy\npoetry: they must have their poetry theatrical, glittering, painted,\nreeking.--Ah! And besides ... besides, even suppose one did succeed ...\nno, that would not fill one's life, it would not fill my life....\"\n",
                "\"You are still thinking of him.\"\n",

At night she would\ntry to choke down her agony, he would guess, and beg the beloved\ncreature who was so near and yet so far, to share with him the burden\nwhich lay so heavy on her: then she could not hold out any longer, and\nshe would turn weeping to his arms; and he would spend hours in\ncomforting her, kindly, without a spark of anger: but in the long-run\nher perpetual restlessness was bound to tell on him. Fran\u00e7oise trembled\nlest the fever that was in her should infect him. She loved him too much\nto be able to bear the idea that he should suffer because of her.

                "They looked at each other mournfully and shamefacedly. They laughed to\nkeep themselves from weeping, kissed, and parted with tears in their\neyes. Never had they loved so well as when they parted.\n",
                "And after she was gone he returned to art, his old companion.... Oh, the\npeace of the starry sky!\n",
                "It was not long before Christophe received a letter from Jacqueline. It\nwas only the third time she had written to him, and her tone was very\ndifferent from that to which she had accustomed him. She told him how\nsorry she was not to have seen him for so long, and very nicely invited\nhim to come and see her, unless he wished to hurt two friends who loved\nhim. Christophe was delighted, but not greatly surprised. He had been\ninclined to think that Jacqueline's unjust disposition towards him would\nnot last. He was fond of quoting a jest of his old grandfather's:\n",
                "\"Sooner or later women have their good moments: one only needs the\npatience to wait for them.\"\n",
                "He went to see Olivier, and was welcomed with delight. Jacqueline was\nmost attentive to him: she avoided the ironical manner which was natural\nto her, took care not to say anything that might hurt Christophe, showed\ngreat interest in what he was doing, and talked intelligently about\nserious subjects. Christophe thought her transformed. But she was only\nso to please him. Jacqueline had heard of Christophe's affair with the\npopular actress, the tale of which had gone the rounds of Parisian\ngossip: and Christophe had appeared to her in an altogether new light:\nshe was filled with curiosity about him. When she met him again she\nfound him much more sympathetic. Even his faults seemed to her to be not\nwithout attraction. She realized that Christophe had genius, and that it\nwould be worth while to make him love her.\n",
                "The position between the young couple was no better, but rather worse.\nJacqueline was bored, bored, bored: she was bored to death.... How\nutterly lonely a woman is! Except children, nothing can hold her: and\nchildren are not enough to hold her forever: for when she is really a\nwoman, and not merely a female, when she has a rich soul and an\nabounding vitality, she is made for so many things which she cannot\naccomplish alone and with none to help her!... A man is much less\nlonely, even when he is most alone: he can people the desert with his\nown thoughts: and when he is lonely in married life he can more easily\nput up with it, for he notices it less, and can always live in the\nsoliloquy of his own thoughts. And it never occurs to him that the sound\nof his voice going on imperturbably babbling in the desert, makes the\nsilence more terrible and the desert more frightful for the woman by his\nside, for whom all words are dead that are not kindled by love. He does\nnot see it: he has not, like the woman, staked his whole life on love:\nhis life has other occupations.... What man is there can fill the life\nof a woman and satisfy her immense desire, the millions of ardent and\ngenerous forces that, through the forty thousand years of the life of\nhumanity, have burned to no purpose, as a holocaust offered up to two\nidols: passing love and motherhood, that sublime fraud, which is refused\nto thousands of women and never fills more than a few years in the lives\nof the rest?\n",
                "Jacqueline was in despair. She had moments of terror that cut through\nher like swords. She thought:\n",
                "\"Why am I alive? Why was I ever born?\" And her heart would ache and\nthrob in agony.\n",
                "\"My God, I am going to die! My God, I am going to die!\"\n",
                "That idea haunted her, obsessed her through the night. She used to dream\nthat she was saying:\n",
                "\"It is 1889.\"\n",
                "\"No,\" the answer would come. \"It is 1909.\" And the thought that she was\ntwenty years older than she imagined would make her wretched.\n",
                "\"It will all be over, and I have never lived! What have I done with\nthese twenty years? What have I made of my life?\"\n",
                "She would dream that she was _four_ little girls, all four lying in\nthe same room in different beds. They were all of the same figure and\nthe same face: but one was eight, one was fifteen, one was twenty, and\nthe fourth was thirty. There was an epidemic. Three of them had died.\nThe fourth looked at herself in the mirror, and she was filled with\nterror: she saw herself with the skin drawn tight over her nose, and her\nfeatures pinched and withered... she was going to die too--and then it\nwould be all over....\n",
                "\"... What have I done with my life?...\" She would wake up in tears; and\nthe nightmare would not vanish with the day: the nightmare was real.\nWhat had she done with her life? Who had robbed her of it?... She would\nbegin to hate Olivier, the innocent accomplice--(innocent! What did it\nmatter if the harm done was the same!)--of the blind law which was\ncrushing her. She would be sorry for it at once, for she was kind of\nheart: but she was suffering too much: and she could not help wreaking\nher vengeance on the man who was bound to her and was stifling her life,\nby making him suffer more than he was indeed suffering. Then she would\nbe more sorry than ever: she would loathe herself and feel that if she\ndid not find some way of escape she would do things even more evil. She\ngroped blindly about to find some way of escape: she clutched at\neverything like a drowning woman: she tried to take an interest in\nsomething, work, or another human being, that might be in some sort her\nown, her work, a creature belonging to herself. She tried to take up\nsome intellectual work, and learned foreign languages: she began an\narticle, a story: she began to paint, to compose.... In vain: she grew\ntired of everything, and lost heart the very first day. They were too\ndifficult. And then, \"books, works of art! What are they? I don't know\nwhether I love them, I don't even know whether they\nexist....\"--Sometimes she would talk excitedly and laugh with Olivier,\nand seem to be keenly interested in the things they talked about, or in\nwhat he was doing: she would try to bemuse and benumb herself.... In\nvain: suddenly her excitement would collapse, her heart would go icy\ncold, she would hide away, with never a tear, hardly a breath, utterly\nprostrate.--She had in some measure succeeded in destroying Olivier. He\nwas growing skeptical and worldly. She did not mind: she found him as\nweak as herself. Almost every evening they used to go out: and she would\ngo in an agony of suffering and boredom from one fine house to another,\nand no one would ever guess the feeling that lay behind the irony of her\nunchanging smile. She was seeking for some one to love her and keep her\nback from the edge of the abyss.... In vain, in vain, in vain. There was\nnothing but silence in answer to her cry of despair.\n",
                "She did not love Christophe: she could not bear his rough manner, his\npainful frankness, and, above all, his indifference. She did not love\nhim: but she had a feeling that he at least was strong,--a rock towering\nabove death. And she tried to clutch hold of the rock, to cling to the\nswimmer whose head rose above the waves, to cling to him or to drown\nwith him....\n",
                "Besides, it was not enough for her to have cut her husband off from his\nfriends: now she was driven on to take them from him. Even the best of\nwomen sometimes have an instinct which impels them to try and see how\nfar their power goes, and to go beyond it. In that abuse of their power\ntheir weakness proves its strength. And when the woman is selfish and\nvain she finds a malign pleasure in robbing her husband of the\nfriendship of his friends. It is easily done: she has but to use her\neyes a little. There is hardly a single man, honorable or otherwise, who\nis not weak enough to nibble at the bait. Though the friend be never so\ntrue and loyal, he may avoid the act, but he will almost always betray\nhis friend in thought. And if the other man sees it, there is an end of\ntheir friendship: they no longer see each other with the same eyes.--The\nwoman who plays such a dangerous game generally stops at that and asks\nno more: she has them both, disunited, at her mercy.\n",
                "Christophe observed Jacqueline's new graces and charming treatment of\nhimself, but he was not surprised. When he had an affection for any one\nhe had a na\u00efve way of taking it as a matter of course that the affection\nshould be returned without any ulterior thought. He responded gladly to\nJacqueline's advances; he thought her charming, and amused himself\nthoroughly with her: and he thought so well of her that he was not far\nfrom thinking Olivier rather a bungler not to be able to be happy with\nher and to make her happy.\n",
                "He went with them for a few days' tour in a motor-car: and he was their\nguest at the Langeais' country house in Burgundy--an old family mansion\nwhich was kept because of its associations, though they hardly ever went\nthere. It was in a lovely situation, in the midst of vineyards and\nwoods: it was very shabby inside, and the windows were loose in their\nframes: there was a moldy smell in it, a smell of ripe fruit, of cold\nshadow, and resinous trees warmed by the sun. Living constantly in\nJacqueline's company for days together, a sweet insidious feeling crept\ninto Christophe's veins, without in the least disturbing his peace of\nmind: he took an innocent, though by no means immaterial, delight in\nseeing her, hearing her, feeling the contact of her beautiful body, and\nsipping the breath of her mouth. Olivier was a little anxious and\nuneasy, but said nothing. He suspected nothing: but he was oppressed by\na vague uneasiness which he would have been ashamed to admit to himself:\nby way of punishing himself for it he frequently left them alone\ntogether. Jacqueline saw what he was thinking, and was touched by it:\nshe longed to say to him:\n",
                "\"Come, don't be anxious, my dear. I still love you the best.\"\n",
                "But she did not say it: and they all three went on drifting: Christophe\nentirely unconscious, Jacqueline not knowing what she really wanted, and\nleaving it to chance to tell her, and Olivier alone seeing and feeling\nwhat was in the wind, but in the delicacy of vanity and love, refusing\nto think of it. When the will is silent, instinct speaks: in the absence\nof the soul, the body goes its own way.\n",
                "One evening, after dinner, the night seemed to them so lovely--a\nmoonless, starry night,--that they proposed to go for a walk in the\ngarden. Olivier and Christophe left the house. Jacqueline went up to her\nroom to fetch a shawl. She did not come down. Christophe went to look\nfor her, fuming at the eternal dilatoriness of woman.--(For some time\nwithout knowing it he had slipped into playing the part of the\nhusband.)--He heard her coming. The shutters of her room were closed and\nhe could not see.\n",
                "\"Come along, you dilly-dallying madam,\" cried Christophe gaily. \"You'll\nwear your mirror out if you look at yourself so much.\"\n",
                "She did not reply. She had stopped still. Christophe felt that she was\nin the room: but she did not stir.\n",
                "\"Where are you?\" he said.\n",
                "She did not reply. Christophe said nothing either, and began groping in\nthe dark, and suddenly his heart grew big and began to thump, and he\nstood still. Near him he could hear Jacqueline breathing lightly. He\nmoved again and stopped once more. She was near him: he knew it, but he\ncould not move. There was silence for a second or two. Suddenly he felt\nher hands on his, her lips on his. He held her close. They stood still\nand spoke no word.--Their lips parted; they wrenched away from each\nother. Jacqueline left the room. Christophe followed her, trembling. His\nlegs shook beneath him. He stopped for a moment to lean against the wall\nuntil the tumult in his blood died down. At last he joined them again.\nJacqueline was calmly talking to Olivier. They walked on a few yards in\nfront. Christophe followed them in a state of collapse. Olivier stopped\nto wait for him. Christophe stopped too. Olivier, knowing his friend's\ntemper and the capricious silence in which he would sometimes bar\nhimself, did not persist, and went on walking with Jacqueline. And\nChristophe followed them mechanically, lagging ten yards behind them\nlike a dog. When they stopped, he stopped. When they walked on, he\nwalked on. And so they went round the garden and back into the house.\nChristophe went up to his room and shut himself in. He did not light the\nlamp. He did not go to bed. He could not think. About the middle of the\nnight he fell asleep, sitting, with his head resting in his arms on the\ntable. He woke up an hour later. He lit a candle, feverishly flung\ntogether his papers and belongings, packed his bag, and then flung\nhimself on the bed and slept until dawn. Then he went down with his\nluggage and left the house. They waited for him all morning, and spent\nthe day looking for him. Jacqueline hid her furious anger beneath a mask\nof indifference, and sarcastically pretended to go over her plate. It\nwas not until the following evening that Olivier received a letter from\nChristophe:\n",
                "    \"_My dear Old Fellow_,\n",
                "    \"_Don't lie angry with me for having gone away like a madman.\n    I am mad, you know. But what can I do? I am what I am. Thanks\n    for your dear hospitality. I enjoyed it much. But, you know, I\n    am not fit to live with other people. I'm not so sure either\n    that I am fit to live. I am only fit to stay in my corner and\n    love people--at a distance: it is wiser so. When I see them at\n    too close quarters, I become misanthropic. And I don't want to\n    be that. I want to love men and women, I want to love you all.\n    Oh! How I long to help you all! If I could only help you to\n    be--to be happy! How gladly would I give all the happiness I may\n    have in exchange!... But that is forbidden. One can only show\n    others the way. One cannot go their way in their stead. Each of\n    us must save himself. Save yourself! Save yourselves! I love\n    you._\n",
                "    \"CHRISTOPHE.\n",
                "    \"_My respects to Madame Jeannin_.\"\n",
                "\"Madame Jeannin\" read the letter with a smile of contempt and her lips\ntightly pressed together, and said dryly:\n",
                "\"Well. Follow his advice. Save yourself.\"\n",
                "But when Olivier held out his hand for the letter, Jacqueline crumpled\nit up and flung it down, and two great tears welled up into her eyes.\nOlivier took her hands.\n",
                "\"What's the matter?\" he asked, with some emotion.\n",
                "\"Let me be!\" she cried angrily.\n",
                "She went out. As she reached the door she cried:\n",
                "\"Egoists!\"\n",
                "Christophe had contrived to make enemies of his patrons of the _Grand\nJournal_, as was only likely. Christophe had been endowed by Heaven\nwith the virtue extolled by Goethe: _non-gratitude_.\n",
                "_\"The horror of showing gratitude,\"_ wrote Goethe ironically, _\"is rare,\nand only appears in remarkable men who have risen from the poorest class,\nand at every turn have been forced to accept assistance, which is almost\ninvariably poisoned by the churlishness of the benefactor....\"_\n",
                "Christophe was never disposed to think himself obliged to abase himself\nin return for service rendered, nor--what amounted to the same thing--to\nsurrender his liberty. He did not lend his own benefactions at so much\nper cent.: he gave them. His benefactors, however, were of a very\ndifferent way of thinking. Their lofty moral feeling of the duties of\ntheir debtors was shocked by Christophe's refusal to write the music for\na stupid hymn for an advertising festivity organized by the paper. They\nmade him feel the impropriety of his conduct. Christophe sent them\npacking. And finally he exasperated them by the flat denial which he\ngave shortly afterwards to certain statements attributed to him by the\npaper.\n",
                "Then they began a campaign against him. They used every possible weapon.\nThey dragged out once more the old pettifogging engine of war which has\nalways served the impotent against creative men, and, though it has\nnever killed anybody, yet it never fails to have an effect upon the\nsimple-minded and the fools: they accused him of plagiarism. They went\nand picked out artfully selected and distorted passages from his\ncompositions and from those of various obscure musicians, and they\nproved that he had stolen his inspiration from others. He was accused of\nhaving tried to stifle various young artists. It would have been well\nenough if he had only had to deal with those whose business it is to\nbark, with those critics, those mannikins, who climb on the shoulders of\na great man and cry;\n",
                "\"I am greater than you!\"\n",
                "But no: men of talent must be wrangling among themselves: each man does\nhis best to make himself intolerable to his colleagues: and yet, as\nChristophe said, the world was large enough for all of them to be able\nto work in peace: and each of them in his own talent had quite enough to\nstruggle against.\n",
                "In Germany he found artists so jealous of him that they were ready to\nfurnish his enemies with weapons against him, and even, if need be, to\ninvent them. He found the same thing in France. The nationalists of the\nmusical press--several of whom were foreigners,--flung his nationality\nin his teeth as an insult. Christophe's success had grown widely; and as\nhe had a certain vogue, they pretended that his exaggeration must\nirritate even those who had no definite views--much more those who had.\nAmong the concert-going public, and among people in society and the\nwriters on the young reviews, Christophe by this time had enthusiastic\npartisans, who went into ecstasies over everything he did, and were wont\nto declare that music did not exist before his advent. Some of them\nexplained his music and found philosophic meanings in it which simply\nastounded him. Others would see in it a musical revolution, an assault\non the traditions which Christophe respected more than anybody. It was\nuseless for him to protest. They would have proved to him that he did\nnot know what he had written. They admired themselves by admiring him.\nAnd so the campaign against Christophe met with great sympathy among his\ncolleagues, who were exasperated by the \"log-rolling\" to which he was no\nparty. They did not need to rely on such reasons for not liking his\nmusic: most of them felt with regard to it the natural irritation of the\nman who has no ideas and no difficulty in expressing them according to\nparrot-like formul\u00e6, with the man who is full of ideas and employs them\nclumsily in accordance with the apparent disorder of his creative\nfaculty. How often he had had to face the reproach of not being able to\nwrite hurled at him by scribes, for whom style consisted in recipes\nconcocted by groups or schools, kitchen molds into which thought was\ncast! Christophe's best friends, those who did not try to understand\nhim, and were alone in understanding him, because they loved him,\nsimply, for the pleasure he gave them, were obscure auditors who had no\nvoice in the matter. The only man who could have replied vigorously in\nChristophe's name--Olivier--was at that time out of friends with him,\nand had apparently forgotten him. Thus Christophe was delivered into the\nhands of his adversaries and admirers, who vied with each other in doing\nhim harm. He was too disgusted to reply. When he read the\npronunciamentos directed against him in the pages of an important\nnewspaper by one of those presumptuous critics who usurp the sovereignty\nof art with all the insolence of ignorance and impunity, he would shrug\nhis shoulders and say:\n",
                "\"Judge me. I judge you. Let us meet in a hundred years!\"\n",
                "But meanwhile the outcry against him took its course: and the public, as\nusual, gulped down the most fatuous and shameful accusations.\n",
                "As though his position was not already difficult enough, Christophe\nchose that moment to quarrel with his publisher. He had no reason at all\nto complain of Hecht, who published each new work as it was written, and\nwas honest in business. It is true that his honesty did not prevent his\nmaking contracts disadvantageous to Christophe: but he kept his\ncontracts. He kept them only too well. One day Christophe was amazed to\nsee a septette of his arranged as a quartette, and a suite of piano\npieces clumsily transcribed as a duet, without his having been\nconsulted. He rushed to Heeht's office and thrust the offending music\nunder his nose, and said:\n",
                "\"Do you know these?\"\n",
                "\"Of course,\" said Hecht.\n",
                "\"And you dared ... you dared tamper with my work without asking my\npermission!...\"\n",
                "\"What permission?\" said Hecht calmly. \"Your compositions are mine.\"\n",
                "\"Mine, too, I suppose?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" said Hecht quietly.\n",
                "Christophe started.\n",
                "\"My own work does not belong to me?\"\n",
                "\"They are not yours any longer. You sold them to me.\"\n",
                "\"You're making fun of me! I sold you the paper. Make money out of that\nif you like. But what is written on it is my life-blood; it is mine.\"\n",
                "\"You sold me everything. In exchange for these particular pieces, I gave\nyou a sum of three hundred francs in advance of a royalty of thirty\ncentimes on every copy sold of the original edition. Upon that\nconsideration, without any restriction or reserve, you have assigned to\nme all your rights in your work.\"\n",
                "\"Even the right to destroy it?\"\n",
                "Hecht shrugged his shoulders, rang the bell, and said to a clerk.\n",
                "\"Bring me M. Kraff's account.\"\n",
                "He gravely read Christophe the terms of the contract, which he had\nsigned without reading--from which it appeared, in accordance with the\nordinary run of contracts signed by music publishers in those very\ndistant times--\"that M. Hecht was the assignee of all the rights,\npowers, and property of the author, and had the exclusive right to edit,\npublish, engrave, print, translate, hire, sell to his own profit, in any\nform he pleased, to have the said work performed at concerts,\ncaf\u00e9-concerts, balls, theaters, etc., and to publish any arrangement of\nthe said work for any instrument and even with words, and also to change\nthe title ... etc., etc.\"\n",
                "\"You see,\" he said, \"I am really very moderate.\"\n",
                "\"Evidently,\" said Christophe. \"I ought to thank you. You might have\nturned my septette into a caf\u00e9-concert song.\"\n",
                "He stopped in horror and held his head in his hands.\n",
                "\"I have sold my soul,\" he said over and over again.\n",
                "\"You may be sure,\" said Hecht sarcastically, \"that I shall not abuse\nit.\"\n",
                "\"And to think,\" said Christophe, \"that your Republic authorizes such\npractices! You say that man is free. And you put ideas up to public\nauction.\"\n",
                "\"You have had your money,\" said Hecht.\n",
                "\"Thirty pieces of silver. Yes,\" said Christophe. \"Take them back.\"\n",
                "He fumbled in his pockets, meaning to give the three hundred francs back\nto Hecht. But he had nothing like that sum. Hecht smiled a little\ndisdainfully. His smile infuriated Christophe.\n",
                "\"I want my work back,\" he said. \"I will buy them back from you.\"\n",
                "\"You have no right to do so,\" said Hecht. \"But as I have no desire to\nkeep a man against his will, I am quite ready to give them back to\nyou,--if you are in a position to pay the indemnity stated in the\ncontract.\"\n",
                "\"I will do it,\" said Christophe, \"even if I have to sell myself.\"\n",
                "He accepted without discussion the conditions which Hecht submitted to\nhim a fortnight later. It was an amazing act of folly, and he bought\nback his published compositions at a price five times greater than the\nsum they had brought him in, though it was by no means exorbitant: for\nit was scrupulously calculated on the basis of the actual profits which\nhad accrued to Hecht. Christophe could not pay, and Hecht had counted on\nit. He had no intention of squeezing Christophe, of whom he thought more\nhighly, both as a musician and as a man, than of any other young\nmusician: but he wanted to teach him a lesson: for he could not permit\nhis clients to revolt against what was after all within his rights. He\nhad not made the laws: they were those of the time, and they seemed to\nhim equitable. Besides, he was quite sincerely convinced that they were\nto the benefit of the author as much as to the benefit of the publisher,\nwho knows better than the author how to circulate his work, and is not,\nlike the author, hindered by scruples of a sentimental, respectable\norder, which are contrary to his real interests. He had made up his mind\nto help Christophe to succeed, but in his own way, and on condition that\nChristophe was delivered into his hands, tied hand and foot. He wanted\nto make him feel that he could not so easily dispense with his services.\nThey made a conditional bargain: if, at the end of six months,\nChristophe could not manage to pay, his work should become Hecht's\nabsolute property. It was perfectly obvious that Christophe would not be\nable to collect a quarter of the sum requisite.\n",
                "However, he stuck to it, said good-by to the rooms which were so full of\nmemories for him, and took a less expensive flat,--selling a number of\nthings, none of which, to his great surprise, were of any\nvalue,--getting into debt, and appealing to Mooch's good nature, who,\nunfortunately, was at that time very badly off and ill, being confined\nto the house with rheumatism,--trying to find another publisher, and\neverywhere finding conditions as grasping as Hecht's, and in some cases\na point-blank refusal.\n",
                "It was just at the time when the attack on him in the musical press was\nat its height. One of the leading Parisian papers was especially\nimplacable: he was like a red rag to a bull to one of the staff who did\nnot sign his name; not a week passed but there appeared in the column\nheaded _\u00c9chos_ a spiteful paragraph ridiculing him. The musical\ncritic completed the work of his anonymous colleague: the very smallest\npretext served him as an opportunity of expressing his animosity. But\nthat was only the preliminary skirmishing: he promised to return to the\nsubject and deal with it at leisure, and to proceed in due course to\nexecution. They were in no hurry, knowing that a definite accusation has\nnothing like the same effect on the public as a succession of\ninsinuations repeated persistently. They played with Christophe like a\ncat with a mouse. The articles were all sent to Christophe, and he\ndespised them, though they made him suffer for all that. However, he\nsaid nothing: and, instead of replying--(could he have done so, even if\nhe had wanted to?)--he persisted in the futile and unequal fight with\nhis publisher, provoked by his own vanity. He wasted his time, his\nstrength, his money, and his only weapons, since in the lightness of his\nheart he was rash enough to deprive himself of the publicity which his\nmusic gained through Hecht.\n",
                "Suddenly there was a complete change. The article announced in the paper\nnever appeared. The insinuations against him were dropped. The campaign\nstopped short. More than that: a few weeks later, the critic of the\npaper published incidentally a few eulogistic remarks which seemed to\nindicate that peace was made. A great publisher at Leipzig wrote to\nChristophe offering to publish his work, and the contract was signed on\nterms very advantageous to him. A flattering letter, bearing the seal of\nthe Austrian Embassy, informed Christophe that it was desired to place\ncertain of his compositions on the programs of the galas given at the\nEmbassy. Philomela, whom Christophe was pushing forward, was asked to\nsing at one of the galas: and, immediately afterwards, she was in great\ndemand in the best houses of the German and Italian colonies in Paris.\nChristophe himself, who could not get out of going to one of the\nconcerts, was very well received by the Ambassador. However, a very\nshort conversation showed him that his host, who knew very little about\nmusic, was absolutely ignorant of his work. How, then, did this sudden\ninterest come about? An invisible hand seemed to be protecting him,\nremoving obstacles, and making the way smooth for him. Christophe made\ninquiries. The Ambassador alluded to friends of Christophe--Count and\nCountess Ber\u00e9ny, who were very fond of him. Christophe did not even know\ntheir name: and on the night of his visit to the Embassy he had no\nopportunity of being introduced to them. He did not make any effort to\nmeet them. He was passing through a period of disgust with men, in which\nhe set as little store by his friends as by his enemies: friends and\nenemies were equally uncertain: they changed with the wind: he would\nhave to learn how to do without them, and say, like the old fellow of\nthe seventeenth century:\n",
                "\"_God gave me friends: He took them from me. They have left me. I will\nleave them and say no more about it_.\"\n",
                "Since the day when he left Olivier's house, Olivier had given no sign of\nlife: all seemed over between them. Christophe had no mind to form new\nfriendships. He imagined Count and Countess Ber\u00e9ny to be like the rest\nof the snobs who called themselves his friends: and he made no attempt\nto meet them. He was more inclined to avoid them. He longed to be able\nto escape from Paris. He felt an urgent desire to take refuge for a few\nweeks in soothing solitude. If only he could have a few days, only a few\ndays, to refresh himself in his native country! Little by little that\nidea became a morbid obsession. He wanted once more to see his dear\nriver, his own native sky, the land of his dead kinsfolk. He felt that\nhe must see them. He could not without endangering his freedom: he was\nstill subject to the warrant of arrest issued against him at the time of\nhis flight from Germany. But he felt that he was prepared to go to any\nlengths if he could return, though it were only for one day.\n",
                "As good luck would have it, he spoke of his longing to one of his new\npatrons. A young attach\u00e9 of the German Embassy, whom he met at an At\nHome where he was playing, happened to say to him that his country was\nproud of so fine a musician as himself, to which Christophe replied\nbitterly:\n",
                "\"Our country is so proud of me that she lets me die on her doorstep\nrather than open to me.\"\n",
                "The young diplomatist asked him to explain the situation, and, a few\ndays later, he came to see Christophe, and said:\n",
                "\"People in high places are interested in you. A very great personage who\nalone has the power to suspend the consequence of the sentence which is\nthe cause of your wretchedness has been informed of your position: and\nhe deigns to be touched by it. I don't know how it is that your music\ncan have given him any pleasure: for--(between ourselves)--his taste is\nnot very good: but he is intelligent, and he has a generous heart.\nThough he cannot, for the moment, remove the sentence passed upon you,\nthe police are willing to shut their eyes, if you care to spend\nforty-eight hours in your native town to see your family once more. Here\nis a passport. You must have it endorsed when you arrive and when you\nleave. Be wary, and do not attract attention to yourself.\"\n",
                "Once more Christophe saw his native land. He spent the two days which\nhad been granted him in communion with the earth and those who were\nbeneath it. He visited his mother's grave. The grass was growing over\nit: but flowers had lately been laid on it. His father and grandfather\nslept side by side. He sat at their feet. Their grave lay beneath the\nwall of the cemetery. It was shaded by a chestnut-tree growing in the\nsunken road on the other side of the low wall, over which he could see\nthe golden crops, softly waving in the warm wind: the sun was shining in\nhis majesty over the drowsy earth: he could hear the cry of the quails\nin the corn, and the soft murmuring of the cypress-trees above the\ngraves. Christophe was alone with his dreams. His heart was at peace. He\nsat there with his hands clasping his knees, and his back against the\nwall, gazing up at the sky. He closed his eyes for a moment. How simple\neverything was! He felt at home here with his own people. He stayed\nthere near them, as it were hand in hand. The hours slipped by. Towards\nevening he heard footsteps scrunching on the gravel paths. The custodian\npassed by and looked at Christophe sitting there. Christophe asked him\nwho had laid the flowers on the grave. The man answered that the\nfarmer's wife from Buir came once or twice a year.\n",
                "\"Lorchen?\" said Christophe.\n",
                "They began to talk.\n",
                "\"You are her son?\" said the man.\n",
                "\"She had three,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"I mean the one at Hamburg. The other two turned out badly.\"\n",
                "Christophe sat still with his head thrown back a little, and said\nnothing. The sun was setting.\n",
                "\"I'm going to lock up,\" said the custodian.\n",
                "Christophe got up and walked slowly round the cemetery with him. The\ncustodian did the honors of the place. Christophe stopped every now and\nthen to read the names carved on the gravestones. How many of those he\nknew were of that company! Old Euler,--his son-in-law,--and farther off,\nthe comrades of his childhood, little girls with whom he had played,\n--and there, a name which stirred his heart: Ada.... Peace be with all of\nthem....\n",
                "The fiery rays of the setting sun put a girdle round the calm horizon.\nChristophe left the cemetery. He went for a long walk through the\nfields. The stars were peeping....\n",
                "Next day he came again, and once more spent the afternoon at his vigil.\nBut the fair silent calm of the day before was broken and thrilling with\nlife. His heart sang a careless, happy hymn. He sat on the curb of the\ngrave, and set down the song he heard in pencil in a notebook resting on\nhis knees. So the day passed. It seemed to him that he was working in\nhis old little room, and that his mother was there on the other side of\nthe partition. When he had finished and was ready to go--he had moved a\nlittle away from the grave,--he changed his mind and returned, and\nburied the notebook in the grass under the ivy. A few drops of rain were\nbeginning to fall. Christophe thought:\n",
                "\"It will soon be blotted out. So much the better!... For you alone. For\nnobody else.\"\n",
                "And he went to see the river once more, and the familiar streets where\nso many things were changed. By the gates of the town along the\npromenade of the old fortifications a little wood of acacia-trees which\nhe had seen planted had overrun the place, and they were stifling the\nold trees. As he passed along the wall surrounding the Von Kerichs'\ngarden, he recognized the post on which he used to climb when he was a\nlittle boy, to look over into the grounds: and he was surprised to see\nhow small the tree, the wall, and the garden had become.\n",
                "He stopped for a moment before the front gateway. He was going on when a\ncarriage passed him. Mechanically he raised his eyes: and they met those\nof a young lady, fresh, plump, happy-looking, who stared at him with a\npuzzled expression. She gave an exclamation of surprise. She ordered the\ncarriage to stop, and said:\n",
                "\"Herr Krafft!\"\n",
                "He stopped.\n",
                "She said laughingly:\n",
                "\"Minna....\"\n",
                "He ran to her almost as nervous as he had been on the day when he first\nmet her. [Footnote: See \"Jean-Christophe: Morning.\"]\n",
                "She was with a tall, stout, bald gentleman, with mustachios brushed up\nbelligerently, whom she introduced as \"Herr Reichsgerichtsrat von\nBrombach\"--her husband. She wanted Christophe to go home with her. He\ntried to excuse himself. But Minna exclaimed:\n",
                "\"No, no. You must come; come and dine with us.\"\n",
                "She spoke very loud and very quickly, and, without waiting to be asked,\nbegan to tell him her whole life. Christophe was stupefied by her\nvolubility and the noise she made, and only heard half what she said,\nand stood looking at her. So that was his little Minna. She looked\nblooming, healthy, well-fed: she had a pretty skin and pink complexion,\nbut her features were rather coarse, and her nose in particular was\nthick and heavy. Her gestures, manners, pretty little ways, were just\nthe same; but her size was greatly altered.\n",
                "However, she never stopped talking: she told Christophe all the stories\nof her past; her whole private history, and how she had come to love her\nhusband and her husband her. Christophe was embarrassed. She was an\nuncritical optimist, who found everything belonging to herself perfect\nand superior to other people's possessions--(at least, when she was with\nother people)--her town, her house, her family, her husband, her\ncooking, her four children, and herself. She said of her husband in his\npresence that he was \"the most splendid man she had even seen,\" and that\nthere was in him \"a superhuman force.\" \"The most splendid man\" pinched\nMinna's cheeks laughingly, and assured Christophe that she \"was a very\nremarkable woman.\"\n",
                "It seemed that _Herr Reichsgerichtsrat_ was informed of\nChristophe's position, and did not exactly know whether he ought to\ntreat him with or without respect, having regard on the one hand to the\nwarrant out against him, and on the other to the august protection which\nshielded him: he solved the difficulty by affecting a compromise between\nthe two manners. As for Minna, she went on talking. When she had talked\nher fill about herself to Christophe, she began to talk about him: she\nbattered him with questions as intimate as her answers had been to the\nsupposititious questions which he had never asked. She was delighted to\nsee Christophe again: she knew nothing about his music: but she knew\nthat he was famous: it flattered her to think that she had loved\nhim,--(and that she had rejected him).--She reminded him of it jokingly\nwithout much delicacy. She asked him for his autograph for her album.\nShe pestered him with questions about Paris. She showed a mixture of\ncuriosity and contempt for that city. She pretended that she knew it,\nhaving been to the Folies-Berg\u00e8re, the Op\u00e9ra, Montmartre, and\nSaint-Cloud. According to her, the women of Paris were all _cocottes_, bad\nmothers, who had as few children as possible, and did not look after them,\nand left them at home while they went to the theater or the haunts of\npleasant vice. She did not suffer contradiction. In the course of the\nevening she asked Christophe to play the piano. She thought it charming.\nBut at bottom she admired her husband's playing just as much, for she\nthought him as superior all round as she was herself.\n",
                "Christophe had the pleasure of meeting Minna's mother once more, Frau\nvon Kerich. He still had a secret tenderness for her because she had\nbeen kind to him. She had not lost any of her old kindness, and she was\nmore natural than Minna: but she still treated Christophe with that\nironical affection which used to irritate him in the old days. She had\nstayed very much where he had left her: she liked the same things; and\nit did not seem possible for her to admit that any one could do better\nor differently: she set the Jean-Christophe of the old days against the\nnew Jean-Christophe, and preferred the former.\n",
                "Of those about her no one had changed in mind save Christophe. The\nrigidity of the little town, and its narrowness of outlook, were painful\nto him. His hosts spent part of the evening in talking scandal about\npeople he did not know. They picked out the ridiculous points of their\nneighbors, and they decreed everything ridiculous which was different\nfrom themselves or their own way of doing things. Their malicious\ncuriosity, which was perpetually occupied with trifles, at last made\nChristophe feel quite sick. He tried to talk about his life abroad. But\nat once he became conscious of the impossibility of making them\nunderstand French civilization which had made him suffer, and now became\ndear to him when he stood for it in his own country--the free Latin\nspirit, whose first law is understanding: to understand as much as possible\nof life and mind, at the risk of cheapening moral codes. In his\nhosts, especially in Minna, he found once more the arrogant spirit with\nwhich he had come into such violent contact in the old days, though he\nhad almost forgotten it since,--the arrogance of weakness as much as of\nvirtue,--honesty without charity, pluming itself on its virtue, and\ndespising the weaknesses which it could not understand, a worship of the\nconventional, and a shocked disdain of \"irregular\" higher things. Minna\nwas calmly and sententiously confident that she was always right. There\nwere no degrees in her judgment of others. For the rest, she never made\nany attempt to understand them, and was only occupied with herself. Her\negoism was thinly coated with a blurred metaphysical tinge. She was\nalways talking of her \"ego\" and the development of her \"ego.\" She may\nhave been a good woman, one capable of loving. But she loved herself too\nmuch. And, above all, her respect for herself was too great. She seemed\nto be perpetually saying a _Paternoster_ and an _Ave_ to her \"ego.\" One\nfelt that she would have absolutely and forever ceased to love the man she\nmight have loved the best, if for a single instant he had failed--(even\nthough he were to regret it a thousand times when it was done)--to show a\ndue and proper respect for the dignity of her \"ego.\"... Hang your \"ego\"!\nThink a little of the second person singular!...\n",
                "However, Christophe did not regard her severely. He who was ordinarily\nso irritable listened to her chatter with the patience of an archangel.\nHe would not judge her. He surrounded her, as with a halo, with the\nreligious memory of his childish love, and he kept on trying to find in\nher the image of his little Minna. It was not impossible to find her in\ncertain of her gestures: the quality of her voice had certain notes\nwhich awoke echoes that moved him. He was absorbed in them, and said\nnothing, and did not listen to what she was saying, though he seemed to\nlisten and always treated her with tender gentle respect. But he found\nit hard to concentrate his thoughts: she made too much noise, and\nprevented his hearing Minna. At last he got up, and thought a little\nwearily:\n",
                "\"Poor little Minna! They would like me to think that you are there, in\nthat comely, stout woman, shouting at the top of her voice, and boring\nme to death. But I know that it is not so. Come away, Minna. What have\nwe to do with these people?\"\n",
                "He went away, giving them to understand that he would return on the\nmorrow. If he had said that he was going away that very night, they\nwould not have let him go until it was time to catch the train. He had\nonly gone a few yards in the darkness when he recovered the feeling of\nwell-being which he had had before he met the carriage. The memory of\nhis tiresome evening was wiped out as though a wet sponge had been over\nit: nothing was left of it: it was all drowned in the voice of the\nRhine. He walked along its banks by the house where he was born. He had\nno difficulty in recognizing it. The shutters were closed: all were\nasleep in it. Christophe stopped in the middle of the road: and it\nseemed to him that if he knocked at the door, familiar phantoms would\nopen to him. He went into the field round the house, near the river, and\ncame to the place where he used to go and talk to Gottfried in the\nevening. He sat down. And the old days came to life again. And the dear\nlittle girl who had sipped with him the dream of first love was conjured\nup. Together they lived through their childish tenderness again, with\nits sweet tears and infinite hopes. And he thought with a simple smile:\n",
                "\"Life has taught me nothing. All my knowledge is vain.... All my\nknowledge is vain.... I have still the same old illusions.\"\n",
                "How good it is to love and to believe unfailingly! Everything that is\ntouched by love is saved from death.\n",
                "\"Minna, you are with me,--with me, not with _the other_,--Minna,\nyou will never grow old!...\"\n",
                "The veiled moon darted from her clouds, and made the silver scales on\nthe river's back gleam in her light. Christophe had a vague feeling that\nthe river never used to pass near the knoll where he was sitting. He\nwent near it. Yes. Beyond the pear-tree there used to be a tongue of\nsand, a little grassy slope, where he had often played. The river had\nswept them away: the river was encroaching, lapping at the roots of the\npear-tree. Christophe felt a pang at his heart: he went back towards the\nstation. In that direction a new colony--mean houses, sheds half-built,\ntall factory chimneys--was in course of construction. Christophe thought\nof the acacia-wood he had seen in the afternoon, and he thought:\n",
                "\"There, too, the river is encroaching....\"\n",
                "The old town, lying asleep in the darkness, with all that it contained\nof the living and the dead, became even more dear to him: for he felt\nthat a menace hung over it....\n",
                "_Hostis habet muros...._\n",
                "Quick, let us save our women and children! Death is lying in wait for\nall that we love. Let us hasten to carve the passing face upon eternal\nbronze. Let us snatch the treasure of our motherland before the flames\ndevour the palace of Priam.\n",
                "Christophe scrambled into the train as it was going, like a man fleeing\nbefore a flood. But, like those men who saved the gods of their city\nfrom the wreck, Christophe bore away within his soul the spark of life\nwhich had flown upwards from his native land, and the sacred spirit of\nthe past.\n",
                "Jacqueline and Olivier had come together again for a time. Jacqueline\nhad lost her father, and his death had moved her deeply. In the presence\nof real misfortune she had felt the wretched folly of her other sorrows:\nand the tenderness which Olivier showed towards her had revived her\naffection for him. She was taken back several years to the sad days\nwhich had followed on the death of her Aunt Marthe--days which had been\nfollowed by the blessed days of love. She told herself that she was\nungrateful to life, and that she ought to be thankful that the little it\nhad given her was not taken from her. She hugged that little to herself\nnow that its worth had been revealed to her. A short absence from Paris,\nordered by her doctor to distract her in her grief, travel with Olivier,\na sort of pilgrimage to the places where they had loved each other\nduring the first year of her marriage, softened her and filled her with\ntenderness. In the sadness of seeing once more at the turn of the road\nthe dear face of the love which they thought was gone forever, of seeing\nit pass and knowing that it would vanish once more,--for how long?\nperhaps forever?--they clutched at it passionately and desperately....\n",
                "\"Stay, stay with us!\"\n",
                "But they knew that they must lose it....\n",
                "When Jacqueline returned to Paris she felt a little new life, kindled by\nlove, thrilling in her veins. But love had gone already. The burden\nwhich lay so heavy upon her did not bring her into sympathy with Olivier\nagain. She did not feel the joy she expected. She probed herself\nuneasily. Often when she had been so tormented before she had thought\nthat the coming of a child might be her salvation. The child had come,\nbut it brought no salvation. She felt the human plant rooted in her\nflesh growing, and sucking up her blood and her life. She would stay for\ndays together lost in thought, listening with vacant eyes, all her being\nexhausted by the unknown creature that had taken possession of her. She\nwas conscious of a vague buzzing, sweet, lulling, agonizing. She would\nstart suddenly from her torpor--dripping with sweat, shivering, with a\nspasm of revolt. She fought against the meshes in which Nature had\nentrapped her. She wished to live, to live freely, and it seemed to her\nthat Nature had tricked her. Then she was ashamed of such thoughts, and\nseemed monstrous in her own eyes, and asked herself if she were more\nwicked than, or made differently from, other women. And little by little\nshe would grow calm again, browsing like a tree over the sap, and the\ndream of the living fruit ripening in her womb. What was it? What was it\ngoing to be?...\n",
                "When she heard its first cry to the light, when she saw its pitiable\ntouching little body, her heart melted. In one dazzling moment she knew\nthe glorious joy of motherhood, the mightiest in all the world: in her\nsuffering to have created of her own flesh a living being, a man. And\nthe great wave of love which moves the universe, caught her whole body,\ndashed her down, rushed over her, and lifted her up to the heavens.... O\nGod, the woman who creates is Thy equal: and thou knowest no joy like\nunto hers: for thou hast not suffered....\n",
                "Then the wave rolled back, and her soul dropped back into the depths.\nOlivier, trembling with emotion, stooped over the child: and, smiling at\nJacqueline, he tried to understand what bond of mysterious life there\nwas between themselves and the wretched little creature that was as yet\nhardly human. Tenderly, with a little feeling of disgust, he just\ntouched its little yellow wrinkled face with his lips. Jacqueline\nwatched him: jealously she pushed him away: she took the child and\nhugged it to her breast, and covered it with kisses. The child cried and\nshe gave it back, and, with her face turned to the wall, she wept.\nOlivier came to her and kissed her, and drank her tears: she kissed him\ntoo, and forced herself to smile: then she asked to be left alone to\nrest with the child by her side.... Alas! what is to be done when love\nis dead? The man who gives more than half of himself up to intelligence\nnever loses a strong feeling without preserving a trace, an idea, of it\nin his brain. He cannot love any more, but he cannot forget that he has\nloved. But the woman who has loved wholly and without reason, and\nwithout reason ceases wholly to love, what can she do? Will? Take refuge\nin illusions? And what if she be too weak to will, too true to take\nrefuge in illusions?...\n",
                "Jacqueline, lying on her side with her head propped up by her hand,\nlooked down at the child with tender pity. What was he? Whatever he was,\nhe was not entirely hers. He was also something of \"the other.\" And she\nno longer loved \"the other.\" Poor child! Dear child! She was exasperated\nwith the little creature who was there to bind her to the dead past: and\nshe bent over him and kissed and kissed him....\n",
                "It is the great misfortune of the women of to-day that they are too free\nwithout being free enough. If they were more free, they would seek to\nform ties, and would find charm and security in them. If they were less\nfree, they would resign themselves to ties which they would not know how\nto break: and they would suffer less. But the worst state of all is to\nhave ties which do not bind, and duties from which it is possible to\nbreak free.\n",
                "If Jacqueline had believed that her little house was to be her lot for\nthe whole of her life, she would not have found it so inconvenient and\ncramped, and she would have devised ways of making it comfortable: she\nwould have ended as she began, by loving it. But she knew that it was\npossible to leave, it, and it stifled her. It was possible for her to\nrevolt, and at last she came to think it her duty to do so.\n",
                "The present-day moralists are strange creatures. All their qualities\nhave atrophied to the profit of their faculties of observation. They\nhave given up trying to see life, hardly attempt to understand it, and\nnever by any chance WILL it. When they have observed and noted down the\nfacts of human nature, they seem to think their task is at an end, and\nsay:\n",
                "\"That is a fact.\"\n",
                "They make no attempt to change it. In their eyes, apparently, the mere\nfact of existence is a moral virtue. Every sort of weakness seems to\nhave been inserted with a sort of Divine right. The world is growing\ndemocratic. Formerly only the King was irresponsible. Nowadays all men,\npreferably the basest, have that privilege. Admirable counselors! With\ninfinite pains and scrupulous care they set themselves to prove to the\nweak exactly how weak they are, and that it has been decreed that they\nshould be so and not otherwise from all eternity. What can the weak do\nbut fold their arms? We may think ourselves lucky if they do not admire\nthemselves! By dint of hearing it said over and over again that she is a\nsick child, a woman soon takes a pride in being so. It is encouraging\ncowardice, and making it spread. If a man were to amuse himself by\ntelling children complacently that there is an age in adolescence when\nthe soul, not yet having found its balance, is capable of crimes, and\nsuicide, and the worst sort of physical and moral depravity, and were to\nexcuse these things--at once these offenses would spring into being. And\neven with men it is quite enough to go on telling them that they are not\nfree to make them cease to be so and descend to the level of the beasts.\nTell a woman that she is a responsible being, and mistress of her body\nand her will, and she will be so. But you moralists are cowards, and\ntake good care not to tell her so: for you have an interest in keeping\nsuch knowledge from her!...\n",
                "The unhappy surroundings in which Jacqueline found herself led her\nastray. Since she had broken with Olivier she had returned to that\nsection of society which she despised when she was a girl. About her and\nher friends, among married women, there gathered a little group of\nwealthy young men and women, smart, idle, intelligent, and licentious.\nThey enjoyed absolute liberty of thought and speech, tempered only by\nthe seasoning of wit. They might well have taken for their motto the\ndevice of the Rabelaisian abbey:\n",
                " _\"Do what thou wilt.\"_\n",
                "But they bragged a little: for they did not will anything much: they\nwere like the enervated people of Thelema. They would complacently\nprofess the freedom of their instincts: but their instincts were faded\nand faint; and their profligacy was chiefly cerebral. They delighted in\nfeeling themselves sink into the great piscina of civilization, that\nwarm mud-bath in which human energy, the primeval and vital forces,\nprimitive animalism, and its blossom of faith, will, duties, and\npassions, are liquefied. Jacqueline's pretty body was steeped in that\nbath of gelatinous thought. Olivier could do nothing to keep her from\nit. Besides, he too was touched by the disease of the time: he thought\nhe had no right to tamper with the liberty of another human being: he\nwould not ask anything of the woman he loved that he could not gain\nthrough love. And Jacqueline did not in the least resent his\nnon-interference, because she regarded her liberty as her right.\n",
                "The worst of it was that she went into that amphibious section of\nsociety with a wholeness of heart which made anything equivocal\nrepulsive to her: when she believed she gave herself: in the generous\nardor of her soul, even in her egoism, she always burned her boats; and,\nas a result of living with Olivier, she had preserved a moral inability\nto compromise, which she was apt to apply even in immorality.\n",
                "Her new friends were too cautious to let others see them as they were.\nIn theory they paraded absolute liberty with regard to the prejudices of\nmorality and society, though in practice they so contrived their affairs\nas not to fall out with any one whose acquaintance might be useful to\nthem: they used morality and society, while they betrayed them like\nunfaithful servants, robbing their masters. They even robbed each other\nfor want of anything better to do, and as a matter of habit. There was\nmore than one of the men who knew that his wife had lovers. The wives\nwere not ignorant of the fact that their husbands had mistresses. They\nboth put up with it. Scandal only begins when one makes a noise about\nthese things. These charming marriages rested on a tacit understanding\nbetween partners--between accomplices. But Jacqueline was more frank,\nand played to win or lose. The first thing was to be sincere. Again, to\nbe sincere. Again and always, to be sincere. Sincerity was also one of\nthe virtues extolled by the ideas of that time. But herein it is proved\nonce again that everything is sound for the sound in heart, while\neverything is corrupt for the corrupt. How hideous it is sometimes to be\nsincere! It is a sin for mediocre people to try to look into the depths\nof themselves. They see their mediocrity: and their vanity always finds\nsomething to feed on.\n",
                "Jacqueline spent her time in looking at herself in her mirror: she saw\nthings in it which it were better she had never seen: for when she saw\nthem she could not take her eyes off them: and instead of struggling\nagainst them she watched them grow: they became enormous and in the end\ncaptured her eyes and her mind.\n",
                "The child was not enough to fill her life. She had not been able to\nnurse it: the baby pined with her. She had to procure a wet nurse. It\nwas a great grief to her at first.... Soon it became a solace. The child\nbecame splendidly healthy: he grew lustily, and became a fine little\nfellow, gave no trouble, spent his time in sleeping, and hardly cried at\nall at night. The nurse--a strapping Nivernaise who had fostered many\nchildren, and always had a jealous and embarrassing animal affection for\neach of them in turn--was like the real mother. Whenever Jacqueline\nexpressed an opinion, the woman went her own way: and if Jacqueline\ntried to argue, in the end she always found that she knew nothing at all\nabout it. She had never really recovered from the birth of the child: a\nslight attack of phlebitis had dragged her down, and as she had to lie\nstill for several weeks she worried and worried: she was feverish, and\nher mind went on and on indefinitely beating out the same monotonous\ndeluded complaint:\n",
                "\"I have not lived, I have not lived: and now my life is finished....\"\n",
                "For her imagination was fired: she thought herself crippled for life:\nand there rose in her a dumb, harsh, and bitter rancor, which she did\nnot confess to herself, against the innocent cause of her illness, the\nchild. The feeling is not so rare as is generally believed: but a veil\nis drawn over it: and even those who feel it are ashamed to submit to it\nin their inmost hearts. Jacqueline condemned herself: there was a sharp\nconflict between her egoism and her mother's love. When she saw the\nchild sleeping so happily, she was filled with tenderness: but a moment\nlater she would think bitterly:\n",
                "\"He has killed me.\"\n",
                "And she could not suppress a feeling of irritation and revolt against\nthe untroubled sleep of the creature whose happiness she had bought at\nthe price of her suffering. Even after she had recovered, when the child\nwas bigger, the feeling of hostility persisted dimly and obscurely. As\nshe was ashamed of it, she transferred it to Olivier. She went on\nfancying herself ill: and her perpetual care of her health, her\nanxieties, which were bolstered up by the doctors, who encouraged the\nidleness which was the prime cause of it all,--(separation from the\nchild, forced inactivity, absolute isolation, weeks of emptiness spent\nin lying in bed and being stuffed with food, like a beast being fatted\nfor slaughter),--had ended by concentrating all her thoughts upon,\nherself. The modern way of curing neurasthenia is very strange, being\nneither more nor less than the substitution of hypertrophy of the ego\nfor a disease of the ego! Why not bleed their egoism, or restore the\ncirculation of the blood from head to heart, if they do not have too\nmuch, by some violent, moral reagent!\n",
                "Jacqueline came out of it physically stronger, plumper, and\nrejuvenated,--but morally she was more ill than ever. Her months of\nisolation had broken the last ties of thought which bound her to\nOlivier. While she lived with him she was still under the ascendancy of\nhis idealism, for, in spite of all his failings, he remained constant to\nhis faith: she struggled in vain against the bondage in which she was\nheld by a mind more steadfast than her own, against the look which\npierced to her very soul, and forced her sometimes to condemn herself,\nhowever loath she might be to do so. But as soon as chance had separated\nher from her husband--as soon as she ceased to feel the weight of his\nall-seeing love--as soon as she was free--the trusting friendship that\nused to exist between them was supplanted by a feeling of anger at\nhaving broken free, a sort of hatred born of the idea that she had for\nso long lived beneath the yoke of an affection which she no longer\nfelt.--Who can tell the hidden, implacable, bitter feelings that seethe\nand ferment in the heart of a creature he loves, by whom he believes\nthat he is loved? Between one day and the next, all is changed. She\nloved the day before, she seemed to love, she thought she loved. She\nloves no longer. The man she loved is struck out from her thoughts. She\nsees suddenly that he is nothing to her: and he does not understand: he\nhas seen nothing of the long travail through which she has passed: he\nhas had no suspicion of the secret hostility towards himself that has\nbeen gathering in her: he does not wish to know the reasons for her\nvengeful hatred. Reasons often remote, complex, and obscure,--some\nhidden deep in the mysteries of their inmost life,--others arising from\ninjured vanity, secrets of the heart surprised and judged,--others....\nWhat does she know of them herself? It is some hidden offense committed\nagainst her unwittingly, an offense which she will never forgive. It is\nimpossible to find out, and she herself is not very sure what it is: but\nthe offense is marked deep in her flesh: her flesh will never forget it.\n",
                "To fight against such an appalling stream of disaffection called for a\nvery different type of man from Olivier--one nearer nature, a simpler\nman and a more supple one not hampered with sentimental scruples, a man\nof strong instincts, capable, if need be, of actions which his reason\nwould disavow. He lost the fight before ever it began, for he had lost\nheart: his perception was too clear, and he had long since recognized in\nJacqueline a form of heredity which was stronger than her will, her\nmother's soul reappearing in her: he saw her falling like a stone down\nto the depths of the stock from which she sprang: and his weak and\nclumsy efforts to stay her only accelerated her downfall. He forced\nhimself to be calm. She, from an unconsciously selfish motive, tried to\nbreak down his defenses and make him say violent, brutal, boorish things\nto her so as to have a reason for despising him. If he gave way to\nanger, she despised him. If at once he were ashamed and became\napologetic, she despised him even more. And if he did not, would not,\ngive way to anger--then she hated him. And worst of all was the silence\nwhich for days together would rise like a wall between them. A\nsuffocating, crushing, maddening silence which brings even the gentlest\ncreatures to fury and exasperation, and makes them have moments when\nthey feel a savage desire to hurt, to cry out, or make the other cry\nout. The black silence in which love reaches its final stage of\ndisintegration, and the man and the woman, like the worlds, each\nfollowing its own orbit, pass onward into the night.... They had reached\na point at which everything they did, even an attempt to come together\nagain, drove them farther and farther apart. Their life became\nintolerable. Events were precipitated by an accident.\n",
                "During the past year C\u00e9cile Fleury had often been to the Jeannins'.\nOlivier had met her at Christophe's: then Jacqueline had invited her to\nthe house; and C\u00e9cile went on seeing them even after Christophe had\nbroken with them. Jacqueline had been kind to her: although she was\nhardly at all musical and thought C\u00e9cile a little common, she felt the\ncharm of her singing and her soothing influence. Olivier liked playing\nwith her, and gradually she became a friend of the family. She inspired\nconfidence: when she came into the Jeannins' drawing-room with her\nhonest eyes and her air of health and high spirits, and her rather loud\nlaugh which it was good to hear, it was like a ray of sunlight piercing\nthe mist. She brought a feeling of inexpressible relief and solace to\nOlivier and Jacqueline. When she was leaving they longed to say to her:\n",
                "\"No. Stay, stay a little while longer, for I am cold!\"\n",
                "During Jacqueline's absence Olivier saw C\u00e9cile more often: he could not\nhelp letting her see something of his troubles. He did it quite\nunthinkingly, with the heedlessness of a weak and tender creature who is\nstifling and has need of some one to confide in, with an absolute\nsurrender. C\u00e9cile was touched by it: she soothed him with motherly words\nof comfort. She pitied both of them, and urged Olivier not to lose\nheart. But whether it was that she was more embarrassed than he by his\nconfidences, or that there was some other reason, she found excuses for\ngoing less often to the house. No doubt it seemed to her that she was\nnot acting loyally towards Jacqueline, for she had no right to know her\nsecrets. At least, that was how Olivier interpreted her estrangement:\nand he agreed with her, for he was sorry that he had spoken. But the\nestrangement made him feel what C\u00e9cile had become to him. He had grown\nused to sharing his ideas with her, and she was the only creature who\ncould deliver him from the pain he was suffering. He was too much\nskilled in reading his own feelings to have any doubt as to the name of\nwhat he felt for her. He would never have said anything to C\u00e9cile. But\nhe could not resist the imperative desire to write down what he felt.\nFor some little time past he had returned to the dangerous habit of\ncommuning with his thoughts on paper. He had cured himself of it during\nthe years of love: but now that he found himself alone once more, his\ninherited mania took possession of him: it was a relief from his\nsufferings, and it was the artist's need of self-analysis. So he\ndescribed himself, and set his troubles down in writing, as though he\nwere telling them to C\u00e9cile--more freely indeed; since she was never to\nread it. And as luck would have it the manuscript came into Jacqueline's\nhands. It happened one day when she was feeling nearer Olivier than she\nhad been for years. As she was clearing out her cupboard she read once\nmore the old love-letters he had sent her: she had been moved to tears\nby them. Sitting in the shadow of the cupboard, unable to go on with her\ntidying, she lived through the past once more: and then was filled with\nsorrow and remorse to think that she had destroyed it. She thought of\nthe grief it must be to Olivier; she had never been able to face the\nidea of it calmly: she could forget it: but she could not bear to think\nthat he had suffered through her. Her heart ached. She longed to throw\nherself into his arms and say:\n",
                "\"Oh! Olivier, Olivier, what have we done? We are mad, we are mad! Don't\nlet us ever again hurt each other!\"\n",
                "If only he had come in at that moment!\n",
                "And it was exactly at that moment that she found his letters to\nC\u00e9cile.... It was the end.--Did she think that Olivier had really\ndeceived her? Perhaps. But what does it signify? To her the betrayal was\nnot so much in the act as in the thought and intention. She would have\nfound it easier to forgive the man she loved for taking a mistress than\nfor secretly giving his heart to another woman. And she was right.\n",
                "\"A pretty state of things!\" some will say....--(They are poor creatures\nwho only suffer from the betrayal of love when it is consummated!...\nWhen the heart remains faithful, the sordid offenses of the body are of\nsmall account. When the heart turns traitor, all the rest is\nnothing.)...\n",
                "Jacqueline did not for a moment think of regaining Olivier's love. It\nwas too late! She no longer cared for him enough. Or perhaps she cared\nfor him too much. All her trust in him crumbled away, all that was left\nin her secret heart of her faith and hope in him. She did not tell\nherself that she had scorned him, and had discouraged him, and driven\nhim to his new love, or that his love was innocent: and that after all\nwe are not masters of ourselves sufficiently to choose whether we will\nlove or not. It never occurred to her to compare his sentimental impulse\nwith her flirtation with Christophe: she did not love Christophe, and so\nhe did not count! In her passionate exaggeration she thought that\nOlivier was lying to her, and that she was nothing to him. Her last stay\nhad failed her at the moment when she reached out her hand to grasp\nit.... It was the end.\n",
                "Olivier never knew what she had suffered that day. But when he next saw\nher he too felt that it was the end.\n",
                "From that moment on they never spoke to each other except in the\npresence of strangers. They watched each other like trapped beasts\nfearfully on their guard. Jeremias Gotthelf somewhere describes, with\npitiless simplicity, the grim situation of a husband and a wife who no\nlonger love each other and watch each other, each carefully marking the\nother's health, looking for symptoms of illness, neither actually\nthinking of hastening or even wishing the death of the other, but\ndrifting along in the hope of some sudden accident: and each of them\nliving in the flattering thought of being the healthier of the two.\nThere were moments when both Jacqueline and Olivier almost fancied that\nsuch thoughts were in the other's mind. And they were in the mind of\nneither: but it was bad enough that they should attribute them to each\nother, as Jacqueline did at night when she would lie feverishly awake\nand tell herself that her husband was the stronger, and that he was\nwearing her down gradually, and would soon triumph over her.... The\nmonstrous delirium of a crazy heart and brain!--And to think that in\ntheir heart of hearts, with all that was best in them, they loved each\nother!...\n",
                "Olivier bent beneath the weight of it, and made no attempt to fight\nagainst it; he held aloof and dropped the rudder of Jacqueline's soul.\nLeft to herself with no pilot to steer her, her freedom turned her\ndizzy: she needed a master against whom to revolt: if she had no master\nshe had to make one. Then she was the prey of a fixed idea. Till then,\nin spite of her suffering, she had never dreamed of leaving Olivier.\nFrom that time on she thought herself absolved from every tie. She\nwished to love, before it was too late:--(for, young as she was, she\nthought herself an old woman).--She loved, she indulged in those\nimaginary devouring passions, which fasten on the first object they\nmeet, a face seen in a crowd, a reputation, sometimes merely a name,\nand, having laid hold of it cannot let go, telling the heart that it\ncannot live without the object of its choice, laying it waste, and\ncompletely emptying it of all the memories of the past that filled it;\nother affections, moral ideas, memories, pride of self, and respect for\nothers. And when the fixed idea dies in its time for want of anything to\nfeed it, after it has consumed everything, who can tell what the new\nnature may be that will spring from the ruins, a nature often without\nkindness, without pity, without youth, without illusions, thinking of\nnothing but devouring life as grass smothers and devours the ruins of\nmonuments!\n",
                "In this case, as usual, the fixed idea fastened on a creature of the\ntype that most easily tricks the heart. Poor Jacqueline fell in love\nwith a philanderer, a Parisian writer, who was neither young nor\nhandsome, a man who was heavy, red-faced, dissipated, with bad teeth,\nabsolutely and terribly heartless, whose chief merit was that he was a man\nof the world and had made a great many women unhappy. She had not\neven the excuse that she did not know how selfish he was: for he paraded\nit in his art. He knew perfectly what he was doing: egoism enshrined in\nart is like a mirror to larks, like a candle to moths. More than one\nwoman in Jacqueline's circle had been caught: quite recently one of her\nfriends, a young, newly-married woman, whom he had had no great\ndifficulty in seducing, had been deserted by him. Their hearts were not\nbroken by it, though they found it hard to conceal their discomfiture\nfrom the delight of the gossips. Even those who were most cruelly hurt\nwere much too careful of their interests and their social interests not\nto keep their perturbation within the bounds of common sense. They made\nno scandal. Whether they deceived their husbands or their lovers, or\nwhether they were themselves deceived and suffered, it was all done in\nsilence. They were the heroines of scandalous rumors.\n",
                "But Jacqueline was mad: she was capable not only of doing what she said,\nbut also of saying what she did. She brought into her folly an absolute\nlack of selfish motive, and an utter disinterestedness. She had the\ndangerous merit of always being frank with herself and of never shirking\nthe consequences of her own actions. She was a better creature than the\npeople she lived with: and for that reason she did worse. When she\nloved, when she conceived the idea of adultery, she flung herself into\nit headlong with desperate frankness.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Madame Arnaud was alone in her room, knitting with the feverish\ntranquillity with which Penelope must have woven her famous web. Like\nPenelope, she was waiting for her husband's return. M. Arnaud used to\nspend whole days away from home. He had classes in the morning and\nevening. As a rule he came back to lunch. Although he was a slow walker\nand his school was at the other end of Paris, he forced himself to take\nthe long walk home, not so much from affection, as from habit, and for\nthe sake of economy. But sometimes he was detained by lectures, or he\nwould take advantage of being in the neighborhood of a library to go and\nwork there. Lucile Arnaud would be left alone in the empty flat. Except\nfor the charwoman who came from eight to ten to do the cleaning, and the\ntradesmen who came to fetch and bring orders, no one ever rang the bell.\nShe knew nobody in the house now. Christophe had removed, and there were\nnewcomers in the lilac garden. C\u00e9line Chabran had married Andr\u00e9\nElsberger. \u00c9lie Elsberger had gone away with his family to Spain, where\nhe had been appointed manager of a mine. Old Weil had lost his wife and\nhardly ever lived in his flat in Paris. Only Christophe and his friend\nC\u00e9cile had kept up their relations with Lucile Arnaud: but they lived\nfar away, and they were busy and hard at work all day long, so that they\noften did not come to see her for weeks together. She had nothing\noutside herself.\n",
                "She was not bored. She needed very little to keep her interest in things\nalive: the very smallest daily task was enough, or a tiny plant, whose\ndelicate foliage she would clean with motherly care every morning. She\nhad her quiet gray cat, who had lost something of his manners, as is apt\nto happen with domestic animals who are loved by their masters: he used\nto spend the day, like herself, sitting by the fire, or on the table\nnear the lamp watching her fingers as she sewed, and sometimes gazing at\nher with his strange eyes, which watched her for a moment and then\nclosed again. Even the furniture was company to her. Every piece was\nlike a familiar face. She took a childlike pleasure in looking after\nthem, in gently wiping off the dust which settled on their sides, and in\ncarefully replacing them in their usual corners. She would hold silent\nconversations with them. She would smile at the fine Louis XVI.\nround-topped bureau, which was the only piece of old furniture she had.\nEvery day she would feel the same joy in seeing it. She was always\nabsorbed in going over her linen, and she would spend hours standing on\na chair, with her hands and arms deep in the great country cupboard,\nlooking and arranging, while the cat, whose curiosity was roused, would\nspend hours watching her.\n",
                "But her real happiness came when, after her work was done and she had\nlunched alone, God knows how--(she never had much of an appetite)--and\nhad gone the necessary errands, and her day was at an end, she would\ncome in about four and sit by the window or the fire with her work and\nher cat. Sometimes she would find some excuse for not going out at all;\nshe was glad when she could stay indoors, especially in the winter when\nit was snowing. She had a horror of the cold, and the wind, and the mud,\nand the rain, for she was something of a cat herself, very clean,\nfastidious, and soft. She would rather not eat than go and procure her\nlunch when the tradespeople forgot to bring it. In that case she would\nmunch a piece of chocolate or some fruit from the sideboard. She was\nvery careful not to let Arnaud know. These were her escapades. Then\nduring the days when the light was dim, and also sometimes on lovely\nsunny days,--(outside the blue sky would shine, and the noise of the\nstreet would buzz round the dark silent rooms; like a sort of mirage\nenshrouding the soul),--she would sit in her favorite corner, with her\nfeet on her hassock, her knitting in her hands, and go off into\nday-dreams while her fingers plied the needles. She would have one of\nher favorite books by her side: as a rule one of those humble,\nred-backed volumes, a translation of an English novel. She would read\nvery little, hardly more than a chapter a day; and the book would lie on\nher knees open at the same page for a long time together, or sometimes\nshe would not even open it: she knew it already, and the story of it\nwould be in her dreams. So the long novels of Dickens and Thackeray\nwould be drawn out over weeks, and in her dreams they would become\nyears. They wrapped her about with their tenderness. The people of the\npresent day, who read quickly and carelessly, do not know the marvelous\nvigor irradiated by those fine books which must be taken in slowly.\nMadame Arnaud had no doubt that the lives of the characters in the\nnovels were not as real as her own. There were some for whom she would\nhave laid down her life: the tender jealous creature, Lady Castlewood,\nthe woman who loved in silence with her motherly virginal heart, was a\nsister to her: little Dombey was her own dear little boy: she was Dora,\nthe child-wife, who was dying: she would hold out her arms to all those\nchildlike souls which pass through the world with the honest eyes of\npurity: and around her there would pass a procession of friendly beggars\nand harmless eccentrics, all in pursuit of their touchingly preposterous\ncranks and whims,--and at their head the fond genius of dear Dickens,\nlaughing and crying together at his own dreams. At such times, when she\nlooked out of the window, she would recognize among the passers-by the\nbeloved or dreaded figure of this or that personage in that imaginary\nworld. She would fancy similar lives, the same lives, being lived behind\nthe walls of the houses. Her dislike for going out came from her dread\nof that world with its moving mysteries. She saw around her hidden\ndramas and comedies being played. It was not always an illusion. In her\nisolation she had come by the gift of mystical intuition which in the\neyes of the passers-by can perceive the secrets of their lives of\nyesterday and to-morrow, which are often unknown to themselves. She\nmixed up what she actually saw with what she remembered of the novels\nand distorted it. She felt that she must drown in that immense universe.\nAnd she would have to go home to regain her footing.\n",
                "But what need had she to read or to look at others? She had but to gaze\nin upon herself. Her pale, dim existence--seeming so when seen from\nwithout--was gloriously lit up within. There was abundance and fullness\nof life in it. There were memories, and treasures, the existence of\nwhich lay unsuspected.... Had they ever had any reality?--No doubt they\nwere real, since they were real to her.... Oh! the wonder of such lowly\nlives transfigured by the magic wand of dreams!\n",
                "Madame Arnaud would go back through the years to her childhood: each of\nthe little frail flowers of her vanished hopes sprang silently into life\nagain.... Her first childish love for a girl, whose charm had fascinated\nher at first sight: she loved her with the love which is only possible\nto those who are infinitely pure: she used to think she would die at the\ntouch of her: she used to long to kiss her feet, to be her little girl,\nto marry her: the girl had married, had not been happy, had had a child\nwhich died, and then she too had died.... Another love, when she was\nabout twelve years old, for a little girl of her own age, who tyrannized\nover her: a fair-haired mad-cap, gay and imperious, who used to amuse\nherself by making her cry, and then would devour her with kisses: she\nlaid a thousand romantic plans for their future together: then,\nsuddenly, the girl became a Carmelite nun, without anybody knowing why:\nshe was said to be happy.... Then there had been a great passion for a\nman much older than herself. No one had ever known anything about it,\nnot even the object of it. She had given to it a great and ardent\ndevotion and untold wealth of tenderness.... Then another passion: this\ntime she was loved. But from a strange timidity, and mistrust of\nherself, she had not dared to believe that she was loved, or to let the\nman see that she loved him. And happiness passed without her grasping\nit.... Then.... But what is the use of telling others what only has a\nmeaning for oneself? So many trivial facts which had assumed a profound\nsignificance: a little attention at the hands of a friend: a kind word\nfrom Olivier, spoken without his attaching any importance to it:\nChristophe's kindly visits, and the enchanted world evoked by his music:\na glance from a stranger: yes, and even in that excellent woman, so\nvirtuous and pure, certain involuntary infidelities in thought, which\nmade her uneasy and feel ashamed, while she would feebly thrust them\naside, though all the same--being so innocent--they brought a little\nsunshine into her heart.... She loved her husband truly, although he was\nnot altogether the husband of her dreams. But he was kind, and one day\nwhen he said to her: \"My darling wife, you do not know all you are to\nme; you are my whole life,\" her heart melted: and that day she felt that\nshe was one with him, wholly and forever, without any possibility of\ngoing back on it. Each year brought them closer to each other, and\ntightened the bond between them. They had shared lovely dreams: of work,\ntraveling, children. What had become of them?... Alas!... Madame Arnaud\nwas still dreaming them. There was a little boy of whom she had so often\nand so profoundly dreamed, that she knew him almost as well as though he\nreally existed. She had slowly begotten him through the years, always\nadorning him with all the most beautiful things she saw, and the things\nshe loved most dearly.... Silence!...\n",
                "That was all. It meant worlds to her. There are so many tragedies\nunknown, even the most intimate, in the depths of the most tranquil and\nseemingly most ordinary lives! And the greatest tragedy of all perhaps\nis:--_that nothing happens_ in such lives of hope crying for what\nis their right, their just due promised, and refused, by Nature--wasting\naway in passionate anguish--showing nothing of it all to the outside\nworld! Madame Arnaud, happily for herself, was not only occupied with\nherself. Her own life filled only a part of her dreams. She lived also\nin the lives of those she knew, or had known, and put herself in their\nplace: she thought much of Christophe and his friend C\u00e9cile. She was\nthinking of them now. The two women had grown fond of one another. The\nstrange thing was that of the two it was the sturdy C\u00e9cile who felt most\nneed to lean on the frail Madame Arnaud. In reality the healthy,\nhigh-spirited young woman was not so strong as she seemed to be. She was\npassing through a crisis. Even the most tranquil hearts are not immune\nfrom being taken by surprise. Unknown to herself, a feeling of\ntenderness had crept into her heart: she refused to admit it at first:\nbut it had grown so that she was forced to see it:--she loved Olivier.\nHis sweet and affectionate disposition, the rather feminine charm of his\npersonality, his weakness and inability to defend himself, had attracted\nher at once:--(a motherly nature is attracted by the nature which has\nneed of her).--What she had learned subsequently of his marital troubles\nhad inspired her with a dangerous pity for Olivier. No doubt these\nreasons would not have been enough. Who can say why one human being\nfalls in love with another? Neither counts for anything in the matter,\nbut often it merely happens that a heart which is for the moment of its\nguard is taken by surprise, and is delivered up to the first affection\nit may meet on the road,--As soon as she had no room left for doubt as\nto her state of mind, C\u00e9cile bravely struggled to pluck out the barb of\na love which she thought wicked and absurd: she suffered for a long time\nand did not recover. No one would have suspected what was happening to\nher: she strove valiantly to appear happy. Only Madame Arnaud knew what\nit must have cost her. Not that C\u00e9cile had told her her secret. But she\nwould sometimes come and lay her head on Madame Arnaud's bosom. She\nwould weep a little, without a word, kiss her, and then go away\nlaughing. She adored this friend of hers, in whom, though she seemed so\nfragile, she felt a moral energy and faith superior to her own. She did\nnot confide in her. But Madame Arnaud could guess volumes on a hint. The\nworld seemed to her to be a sad misunderstanding. It is impossible to\ndissolve it. One can only love, have pity, and dream.\n",
                "And when the swarm of her dreams buzzed too loudly, when her thoughts\nstopped, she would go to her piano and let her hands fall lightly on the\nkeys, at random, and play softly to wreathe the mirage of life about\nwith the subdued light of music....\n",
                "But the good little creature would not forget to perform her everyday\nduties: and when Arnaud came home he would find the lamp lit, the supper\nready, and his wife's pale, smiling face waiting for him. And he would\nhave no idea of the universe in which she had been living.\n",
                "The great difficulty was to keep the two lives going side by side\nwithout their clashing: her everyday life and that other, the great life\nof the mind, with its far-flung horizons. It was not always easy.\nFortunately Arnaud also lived to some extent in an imaginary life, in\nbooks, and works of art, the eternal fire of which fed the flickering\nflames of his soul. But during the last few years he had become more and\nmore preoccupied with the petty annoyances of his profession, injustice\nand favoritism, and friction with his colleagues or his pupils: he was\nembittered: he began to talk politics, and to inveigh against the\nGovernment and the Jews: and he made Dreyfus responsible for his\ndisappointments at the university. His mood of soreness infected Madame\nArnaud a little. She was at an age when her vital force was upset and\nuneasy, groping for balance. There were great gaps in her thoughts. For\na time they both lost touch with life, and their reason for existence: for\nthey had nothing to which to bind their spider's web, which was left\nhanging in the void. Though the support of reality be never so weak, yet\nfor dreams there must be one. They had no sort of support. They could\nnot contrive any means of propping each other up. Instead of helping\nher, he clung to her. And she knew perfectly well that she was not\nstrong enough to hold him up, for she could not even support herself.\nOnly a miracle could save her. She prayed for it to come. It came from\nthe depths of her soul. In her solitary pious heart Madame Arnaud felt\nthe irony of the sublime and absurd hunger for creation in spite of\neverything, the need of weaving her web in spite of everything, through\nspace, for the joy of weaving, leaving it to the wind, the breath of\nGod, to carry her whithersoever it was ordained that she should go. And\nthe breath of God gave her a new hold on life, and found her an\ninvisible support. Then the husband and wife both set patiently to work\nonce more to weave the magnificent and vain web of their dreams, a web\nfashioned of their purest suffering and their blood.\n",
                "Madame Arnaud was alone in her room.... It was near evening.\n",
                "The door-bell rang. Madame Arnaud, roused from her reverie before the\nusual time, started and trembled. She carefully arranged her work and\nwent to open the door. Christophe came in. He was in a great state of\nemotion. She took his hands affectionately.\n",
                "\"What is it, my dear?\" she asked.\n",
                "\"Ah!\" he said. \"Olivier has come back.\"\n",
                "\"Come back?\"\n",
                "\"He came this morning and said: 'Christophe, help me!' I embraced him.\nHe wept. He told me: I have nothing but you now. She has gone.\"\n",
                "Madame Arnaud gasped, and clasped her hands and said:\n",
                "\"Poor things!\"\n",
                "\"She has gone,\" said Christophe. \"Gone with her lover.\"\n",
                "\"And her child?\" asked Madame Arnaud.\n",
                "\"Husband, child--she has left everything.\"\n",
                "\"Poor thing!\" said Madame Arnaud again.\n",
                "\"He loved her,\" said Christophe. \"He loved her, and her alone. He will\nnever recover from the blow. He keeps on saying: 'Christophe, she has\nbetrayed me.... My dearest friend has betrayed me.' It is no good my\nsaying to him, 'Since she has betrayed you, she cannot have been your\nfriend. She is your enemy. Forget her or kill her!'\"\n",
                "\"Oh! Christophe, what are you saying! It is too horrible!\"\n",
                "'Yes, I know. You all think it barbaric and prehistoric to kill! It is\njolly to hear these Parisians protesting against the brutal instincts\nwhich urge the male to kill the female if she deceives him, and\npreaching indulgence and reason! They're splendid apostles! It is a fine\nthing to see the pack of mongrel dogs waxing wrath against the return to\nanimalism. After outraging life, after having robbed it of its worth,\nthey surround it with religious worship.... What! That heartless,\ndishonorable, meaningless life, the mere physical act of breathing, the\nbeating of the blood in a scrap of flesh, these are the things which\nthey hold worthy of respect! They are never done with their niceness\nabout the flesh: it is a crime to touch it. You may kill the soul if you\nlike, but the body is sacred....\"\n",

                "\"No. You are unfair to yourself. You are so kind.\"\n",
                "\"If I am roused to passion, I am as cruel as the rest. You see how I had\nlost control of myself!... But when you see a friend brought to tears,\nhow can you not hate the person who has caused them? And how can one be\ntoo hard on a woman who leaves her child to run after her lover?\"\n",
                "\"Don't talk like that, Christophe. You don't know.\"\n",
                "\"What! You defend her?\"\n",
                "\"I pity her, too.\"\n",

                "\"Well! Do you think she hasn't suffered too? Do you think she has left\nher child and wrecked her life out of lightness of heart? For her life\nis wrecked too. I hardly know her, Christophe. I have only seen her a\nfew times, and that only in passing: she never said a friendly word to\nme, she was not in sympathy with me. And yet I know her better than you.\nI am sure she is not a bad woman. Poor child! I can guess what she has\nhad to go through....\"\n",
                "\"You.... You whose life is so worthy and so right and sensible!...\"\n",
                "\"Yes, Christophe, I. You do not know. You are kind, but you are a man\nand, like all men, you are hard, in spite of your kindness--a man hard\nand set against everything which is not in and of yourself. You have no\nreal knowledge of the women who live with you. You love them, after your\nfashion; but you never take the trouble to understand them. You are so\neasily satisfied with yourselves! You are quite sure that you know\nus.... Alas! If you knew how we suffer sometimes when we see, not that\nyou do not love us, but how you love us, and that that is all we are to\nthose we love the best! There are moments, Christophe, when we clench\nour fists so that the nails dig into our hands to keep ourselves from\ncrying to you: 'Oh! Do not love us, do not love us! Anything rather than\nlove us like that!'... Do you know the saying of a poet: 'Even in her\nhome, among her children, surrounded with sham honors, a woman endures a\nscorn a thousand times harder to bear than the most utter misery'? Think\nof that, Christophe. They are terrible words.\"\n",
                "\"What you say has upset me. I don't rightly understand. But I am\nbeginning to see.... Then, you yourself....\"\n",
                "\"I have been through all these torments.\"\n",
                "\"Is it possible?... But, even so, you will never make me believe that\nyou would have done the same as that woman.\"\n",
                "\"I have no child, Christophe. I do not know what I should have done in\nher place.\"\n",
                "\"No. That is impossible. I believe in you. I respect you too much. I\nswear that you could not.\"\n",
                "\"Swear nothing! I have been very near doing what she has done.... It\nhurts me to destroy the good idea you had of me. But you must learn to\nknow us a little if you do not want to be unjust. Yes, I have been\nwithin an ace of just such an act of folly. And you yourself had\nsomething to do with my not going on with it. It was two years ago. I\nwas going through a period of terrible depression, that seemed to be\neating my life away. I kept on telling myself that I was no use in the\nworld, that nobody needed me, that even my husband could do without me,\nthat I had lived for nothing.... I was on the very point of running\naway, to do Heaven knows what! I went up to your room.... Do you\nremember?... You did not understand why I came. I came to say good-bye\nto you.... And then, I don't know what happened, I can't remember\nexactly ... but I know that something you said ... (though you had no\nidea of it....) ... was like a flash of light to me.... Perhaps it was\nnot what you said.... Perhaps it was only a matter of opportunity; at\nthat moment the least thing was enough to make or mar me.... When I left\nyou I went back to my own room, locked myself in, and wept the whole day\nthrough.... I was better after that: the crisis had passed.\"\n",
                "\"And now,\" asked Christophe, \"you are sorry?\"\n",
                "\"Now?\" she said. \"Ah! If I had been so mad as to do it I should have\nbeen at the bottom of the Seine long ago. I could not have borne the\nshame of it, and the injury I should have done to my poor husband.\"\n",
                "\"Then you are happy?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. As happy as one can be in this life. It is so rare for two people\nto understand each other, and respect each other, and know that they are\nsure of each other, not merely with a simple lover's belief, which is\noften an illusion, but as the result of years passed together, gray,\ndull, commonplace years even--especially with the memory of the dangers\nthrough which they have passed together. And as they grow older their\ntrust grows greater and finer.\"\n",
                "She stopped and blushed suddenly.\n",
                "\"Oh, Heavens! How could I tell you that?... What have I done?... Forget\nit, Christophe, I beg of you. No one must know.\"\n",
                "\"You need not be afraid,\" said Christophe, pressing her hand warmly. \"It\nshall be sacred to me.\"\n",
                "Madame Arnaud was unhappy at what she had said, and turned away for a\nmoment.\n",
                "Then she went on:\n",
                "\"I ought not to have told you.... But, you see, I wanted to show you\nthat even in the closest and best marriages, even for the women ... whom\nyou respect, Christophe ... there are times, not only of aberration, as\nyou say, but of real, intolerable suffering, which may drive them to\nmadness, and wreck at least one life, if not two. You must not be too\nhard. Men and women make each other suffer terribly even when they love\neach other dearly.\"\n",
                "\"Must they, then, live alone and apart?\"\n",
                "\"That is even worse for us. The life of a woman who has to live alone,\nand fight like men (and often against men), is a terrible thing in a\nsociety which is not ready for the idea of it, and is, in a great\nmeasure, hostile to it....\"\n",
                "She stopped again, leaning forward a little, with her eyes fixed on the\nfire in the grate; then she went on softly, in a rather hushed tone,\nhesitating every now and then, stopping, and then going on:\n",
                "\"And yet it is not our fault when a woman lives like that, she does not\ndo so from caprice, but because she is forced to do so; she has to earn\nher living and learn how to do without a man, since men will have\nnothing to do with her if she is poor. She is condemned to solitude\nwithout having any of its advantages, for in France she cannot, like a\nman, enjoy her independence, even in the most innocent way, without\nprovoking scandal: everything is forbidden her. I have a friend who is a\nschool-mistress in the provinces. If she were shut up in an airless\nprison she could not be more lonely and more stifled. The middle-classes\nclose their doors to women who struggle to earn their living by their\nwork; they are suspected and contemned; their smallest actions are spied\nupon and turned to evil. The masters at the boys' school shun them,\neither because they are afraid of the tittle-tattle of the town, or from\na secret hostility, or from shyness, and because they are in the habit\nof frequenting caf\u00e9s and consorting with low women, or because they are\ntoo tired after the day's work and have a dislike, as a result of their\nwork, for intellectual women. And the women themselves cannot bear each\nother, especially if they are compelled to live together in the school.\nThe head-mistress is often a woman absolutely incapable of understanding\nyoung creatures with a need of affection, who lose heart during the\nfirst few years of such a barren trade and such inhuman solitude; she\nleaves them with their secret agony and makes no attempt to help them;\nshe is inclined to think that they are only vain and haughty. There is\nno one to take an interest in them. Having neither fortune nor\ninfluence, they cannot marry. Their hours of work are so many as to\nleave them no time in which to create an intellectual life which might\nbind them together and give them some comfort. When such an existence is\nnot supported by an exceptional religious or moral feeling,--(I might\nsay abnormal and morbid; for such absolute self-sacrifice is not\nnatural),--it is a living death....--In default of intellectual work,\nwhat resources does charity offer to women? What great disappointments\nit holds out for those women who are too sincere to be satisfied with\nofficial or polite charity, philanthropic twaddle, the odious mixture of\nfrivolity, beneficence, and bureaucracy, the trick of dabbling in\npoverty in the intervals of flirtation! And if one of them in disgust\nhas the incredible audacity to venture out alone among the poor or the\nwretched, whose life she only knows by hearsay, think of what she will\nsee! Sights almost beyond bearing! It is a very hell. What can she do to\nhelp them? She is lost, drowned in such a sea of misfortune. However,\nshe struggles on, she tries hard to save a few of the poor wretches, she\nwears herself out for them, and drowns with them. She is lucky if she\nsucceeds in saving one or two of them! But who is there to rescue her?\nWho ever dreams of going to her aid? For she, too, suffers, both with\nher own and the suffering of others: the more faith she gives, the less\nshe has for herself; all these poor wretches cling desperately to her,\nand she has nothing with which to stay herself. No one holds out a hand\nto her. And sometimes she is stoned.... You knew, Christophe, the\nsplendid woman who gave herself to the humblest and most meritorious\ncharitable work; she took pity on the street prostitutes who had just\nbeen brought to child-bed, the wretched women with whom the Public Aid\nwould have nothing to do, or who were afraid of the Public Aid; she\ntried to cure them physically and morally, to look after them and their\nchildren, to wake in them the mother-feeling, to give them new homes and\na life of honest work. She taxed her strength to the utmost in her grim\nlabors, so full of disappointment and bitterness--(so few are saved, so\nfew wish to be saved! And think of all the babies who die! Poor innocent\nlittle babies, condemned in the very hour of their birth!...)--That\nWoman who had taken upon herself the sorrows of others, the blameless\ncreature who of her own free will expiated the crimes of human\nselfishness--how do you think she was judged, Christophe? The\nevil-minded public accused her of making money out of her work, and even\nof making money out of the poor women she protected. She had to leave\nthe neighborhood, and go away, utterly downhearted....--You cannot\nconceive the cruelty of the struggles which independent women have to\nmaintain against the society of to-day, a conservative, heartless\nsociety, which is dying and expends what little energy it has left in\npreventing others from living.\"\n",
                "\"My dear creature, it is not only the lot of women. We all know these\nstruggles. And I know the refuge.\"\n",

                "\"Art,\"\n",
                "\"All very well for you, but not for us. And even among men, how many are\nthere who can take advantage of it?\"\n",

                "\"How do you know? Ah! You have jumped to conclusions! Because she puts a\nbrave face on it, because she does not stop to think of things that make\nher sad, because she conceals them from others, you say that she is\nhappy! Yes. She is happy to be well and strong, and to be able to fight.\nBut you know nothing of her struggles. Do you think she was made for\nthat deceptive life of art? Art! Just think of the poor women who long\nfor the glory of being able to write or play or sing as the very summit\nof happiness! Their lives must be bare indeed, and they must be so hard\npressed that they can find no affection to which to turn! Art! What have\nwe to do with art, if we have all the rest with it? There is only one\nthing in the world which can make a woman forget everything else,\neverything else: and that is the child.\" \"And when she has a child, you\nsee, even that is not enough.\"\n",
                "\"Yes. Not always.... Women are not very happy. It is difficult to be a\nwoman. Much more difficult than to be a man. You men never realize that\nenough. You can be absorbed in an intellectual passion or some outside\nactivity. You mutilate yourselves, but you are the happier for it. A\nhealthy woman cannot do that without suffering for it. It is inhuman to\nstifle a part of yourself. When we women are happy in one way, we regret\nthat we are not happy in another. We have several souls. You men have\nbut one, a more vigorous soul, which is often brutal and even monstrous.\nI admire you. But do not be too selfish. You are very selfish without\nknowing it. You hurt us often, without knowing it.\"\n",
                "\"What are we to do? It is not our fault.\"\n",
                "\"No, it is not your fault, my dear Christophe. It is not your fault, nor\nis it ours. The truth is, you know, that life is not a simple thing.\nThey say that there we only need to live naturally. But which of us is\nnatural?\"\n",
                "\"True. Nothing is natural in our way of living. Celibacy is not natural.\nNor is marriage. And free love delivers the weak up to the rapaciousness\nof the strong. Even our society is not a natural thing: we have\nmanufactured it. It is said that man is a sociable animal. What\nnonsense! He was forced to be so to live. He has made himself sociable\nfor the purposes of utility, and self-defence, and pleasure, and the\nrise to greatness. His necessity has led him to subscribe to certain\ncompacts. Nature kicks against the constraint and avenges herself.\nNature was not made for us. We try to quell her. It is a struggle, and\nit is not surprising that we are often beaten. How are we to win through\nit? By being strong.\"\n",
                "\"By being kind.\"\n",
                "\"Heavens! To be kind, to pluck off one's armor of selfishness, to\nbreathe, to love life, light, one's humble work, the little corner of\nthe earth in which one's roots are spread. And if one cannot have\nbreadth to try to make up for it in height and depth, like a tree in a\ncramped space growing upward to the sun.\"\n",
                "\"Yes. And first of all to love one another. If a man would feel more\nthat he is the brother of a woman, and not only her prey, or that she\nmust be his! If both would shed their vanity and each think a little\nless of themselves, and a little more of the other!... We are weak: help\nus. Let us not say to those who have fallen: 'I do not know you.' But:\n'Courage, friend. We'll pull through.'\"\n",

                "\"... Don't interest me any longer. I'm sick of it all. I seem to have\npassed out of life altogether. Everything seems so far away.... I see,\nbut I don't understand.... And to think that there are men who never\ngrow tired of winding up their clockwork every day, and doing their dull\nwork, and their newspaper discussions, and their wretched pursuit of\npleasure, men who can be violently for or against a Government, or a\nbook, or an actress.... Oh! I feel so old! I feel nothing, neither\nhatred, nor rancor against anybody. I'm bored with everything. I feel\nthat there is nothing in the world.... Write? Why write? Who understands\nyou? I used to write only for one person: everything that I did was for\nher.... There is nothing left: I'm worn out, Christophe, fagged out. I\nwant to sleep.\"\n",
                "\"Sleep, then, old fellow. I'll sit by you.\"\n",
                "But sleep was the last thing that Olivier could have. Ah! if only a\nsufferer could sleep for months until his sorrow is no more and has no\npart in his new self; if only he could sleep until he became a new man!\nBut that gift can never be his: and he would not wish to have it. The\nworst suffering of all were to be deprived of suffering. Olivier was\nlike a man in a fever, feeding on his fever: a real fever which came in\nregular waves, being at its height in the evening when the light began\nto fade. And the rest of the day it left him shattered, intoxicated by\nlove, devoured by memory, turning the same thought over and over like an\nidiot chewing the same mouthful again and again without being able to\nswallow it, with all the forces of his brain paralyzed, grinding slowly\non with the one fixed idea.\n",
                "He could not, like Christophe, resort to cursing his injuries and\nhonestly blackguarding the woman who had dealt them. He was more\nclear-sighted and just, and he knew that he had his share of the\nresponsibility, and that he was not the only one to suffer: Jacqueline\nalso was a victim:--she was his victim. She had trusted herself to him:\nhow had he dealt with his trust? If he was not strong enough to make her\nhappy, why had he bound her to himself? She was within her rights in\nbreaking the ties which chafed her.\n",
                "\"It is not her fault,\" he thought. \"It is mine. I have not loved her\nwell. And yet I loved her truly. But I did not know how to love since I\ndid not know how to win her love.\"\n",
                "So he blamed himself: and perhaps he was right. But it is not much use\nto hold an inquest on the past: if it were all to do again, it would be\njust the same, inquiry or no inquiry: and such probing stands in the way\nof life. The strong man is he who forgets the injury that has been done\nhim--and also, alas! that which he has done himself, as soon as he is\nsure that he cannot make it good. But no man is strong from reason, but\nfrom passion. Love and passion are like distant relations: they rarely\ngo together. Olivier loved: he was only strong against himself. In the\npassive state into which he had fallen he was an easy prey to every kind\nof illness. Influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, pounced on him. He was ill\nfor part of the summer. With Madame Arnaud's assistance, Christophe\nnursed him devotedly: and they succeeded in checking his illness. But\nagainst his moral illness they could do nothing: and little by little\nthey were overcome by the depression and utter weariness of his\nperpetual melancholy, and were forced to run away from it.\n",
                "Illness plunges a man into a strange solitude. Men have an instinctive\nhorror of it. It is as though they were afraid lest it should be\ncontagious: and at the very least it is boring, and they run away from\nit. How few people there are who can forgive the sufferings of others!\nIt is always the old story of the friends of Job. Eliphaz the Temanite\naccuses Job of impatience. Bildad the Shuhite declares that Job's\nafflictions are the punishment of his sins. Sophar of Naamath charges\nhim with presumption. _\"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu, the son\nof Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath\nkindled, because he justifieth himself, rather than God.\"_--Few men\nare really sorrowful. Many are called, but few are chosen. Olivier was\none of these. As a misanthrope once observed: \"He seemed to like being\nmaltreated. There is nothing to be gained by playing the part of the\nunhappy man. You only make yourself detested.\"\n",
                "Olivier could not tell even his most intimate friends what he felt. He\nsaw that it bored them. Even his friend Christophe lost patience with\nsuch tenacious and importunate grief. He knew that he was clumsy and\nawkward in remedying it. If the truth must be told, Christophe, whose\nheart was generous, Christophe who had gone through much suffering on\nhis own account, could not feel the suffering of his friend. Such is the\ninfirmity of human nature. You may be kind, full of pity, understanding,\nand you may have suffered a thousand deaths, but you cannot feel the\npain of your friend if he has but a toothache. If illness goes on for a\nlong time, there is a temptation to think that the sufferer is\nexaggerating his complaint. How much more, then, must this be so when\nthe illness is invisible and seated in the very depths of the soul! A\nman who is outside it all cannot help being irritated by seeing his\nfriend moaning and groaning about a feeling which does not concern him\nin the very least. And in the end he says: by way of appeasing his\nconscience:\n",
                "\"What can I do? He won't listen to reason, whatever I say.\"\n",
                "To reason: true. One can only help by loving the sufferer, by loving him\nunreasoningly, without trying to convince him, without trying to cure\nhim, but just by loving and pitying him. Love is the only balm for the\nwounds of love. But love is not inexhaustible even with those who love\nthe best: they have only a limited store of it. When the sick man's\nfriends have once written all the words of affection they can find, when\nthey have done what they consider their duty, they withdraw prudently,\nand avoid him like a criminal. And as they feel a certain secret shame\nthat they can help him so little, they help him less and less: they try\nto let him forget them and to forget themselves. And if the sick man\npersists in his misfortune and, indiscreetly, an echo of it penetrates\nto their ears, then they judge harshly his want of courage and inability\nto bear up against his trials. And if he succumbs, it is very certain\nthat lurking beneath their really genuine pity lies this disdainful\nunder-thought:\n",
                "\"Poor devil! I had a better opinion of him.\"\n",
                "Amid such universal selfishness what a marvelous amount of good can be\ndone by a simple word of tenderness, a delicate attention, a look of\npity and love! Then the sick man feels the worth of kindness. And how\npoor is all the rest compared with that!... Kindness brought Olivier\nnearer to Madame Arnaud than anybody else, even his friend Christophe.\nHowever, Christophe most meritoriously forced himself to be patient, and\nin his affection for him, concealed what he really thought of him. But\nOlivier, with his natural keenness of perception sharpened by suffering,\nsaw the conflict in his friend, and what a burden he was upon him with\nhis unending sorrow. It was enough, to make him turn from Christophe,\nand fill him with a desire to cry:\n",
                "\"Go away. Go.\"\n",
                "So unhappiness often divides loving hearts. As the winnower sorts the\ngrain, so sorrow sets on one side those who have the will to live, and\non the other those who wish to die. It is the terrible law of life,\nwhich is stronger than love! The mother who sees her son dying, the\nfriend who sees his friend drowning,--if they cannot save them, they do\nnot cease their efforts to save themselves: they do not die with them.\nAnd yet, they love them a thousand times better than their lives....\n",
                "In spite of his great love, there were moments when Christophe had to\nleave Olivier. He was too strong, too healthy, to be able to live and\nbreathe in such airless sorrow. He was mightily ashamed of himself! He\nwould feel cold and dead at heart to think that he could do nothing for\nhis friend: and as he needed to avenge himself on some one, he visited\nhis wrath upon Jacqueline. In spite of Madame Arnaud's words of\nunderstanding and sympathy, he still judged her harshly, as a young,\nardent, and whole-hearted man must, until he has learned enough of life\nto have pity on its weaknesses.\n",
                "He would go and see C\u00e9cile and the child who had been entrusted to her.\nThat refreshed his soul. C\u00e9cile was transfigured by her borrowed\nmotherhood: she seemed to be young again, and happy, more refined and\ntender. Jacqueline's departure had not given her any unavowed hope of\nhappiness. She knew that the memory of Jacqueline must leave her farther\naway from Olivier than her presence. Besides, the little puff of wind\nthat had set her longing had passed: it had been a moment of crisis,\nwhich the sight of poor Jacqueline's frenzied mistake had helped to\ndissipate: she had returned to her normal tranquillity, and she could\nnot rightly understand what it was that had dragged her out of it. All\nthat was best in her need of love was satisfied by her love for the\nchild. With the marvelous power of illusion--of intuition--of women, she\nfound the man she loved in the little child: in that way she could have\nhim, weak and utterly dependent, utterly her own: he belonged to her:\nand she could love him, love him passionately, with a love as pure as\nthe heart of the innocent child, and his dear blue eyes, like little\ndrops of light.... True, there was mingled with her tenderness a\nregretful melancholy. Ah! It could never be the same thing as a child of\nher own blood!... But it was good, all the same.\n",
                "Christophe now regarded C\u00e9cile with very different eyes. He remembered\nan ironic saying of Fran\u00e7oise Oudon:\n",
                "\"How is it that you and Philomela, who would do so well as husband and\nwife, are not in love with each other?\"\n",
                "But Fran\u00e7oise knew the reason better than Christophe: it is very rarely\nthat a man like Christophe loves those who can do him good: rather he is\napt to love those who can do him harm. Opposites meet: his nature seeks\nits own destruction, and goes to the burning and intense life rather\nthan to the cautious life which is sparing of itself. And a man like\nChristophe is quite right, for his law is not to live as long as\npossible, but as mightily as possible.\n",
                "However, Christophe, having less penetration than Fran\u00e7oise, said to\nhimself that love is a blind, inhuman force, throwing those together who\ncannot bear with each other. Love joins those together who are like each\nother. And what love inspires is very small compared with what it\ndestroys. If it be happy it dissolves the will. If unhappy it breaks\nhearts. What good does it ever do?\n",
                "And as he thus maligned love he saw its ironic, tender smile saying to\nhim:\n",
                "\"Ingrate!\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Christophe had been unable to get out of going to one of the At Homes\ngiven at the Austrian Embassy. Philomela was to sing _lieder_ by\nSchumann, Hugo Wolf, and Christophe. She was glad of her success and\nthat of her friend, who was now made much of by a certain set.\nChristophe's name was gaining ground from day to day, even with the\ngreat public: it had become impossible for the L\u00e9vy-Coeurs to ignore him\nany longer. His works were played at concerts: and he had had an opera\naccepted by the Op\u00e9ra Comique. The sympathies of some person unknown\nwere enlisted on his behalf. The mysterious friend, who had more than\nonce helped him, was still forwarding his claims. More than once\nChristophe had been conscious of that fondly helping hand in everything\nhe did: some one was watching over him and jealously concealing his or\nher identity. Christophe had tried to discover it: but it seemed as\nthough his friend were piqued by his not having attempted sooner to find\nout who he was, and he remained unapproachable. Besides, Christophe was\nabsorbed by other preoccupations: he was thinking of Olivier, he was\nthinking of Fran\u00e7oise: that very morning he had just read in the paper\nthat she was lying seriously ill at San Francisco: he imagined her alone\nin a strange city, in a hotel bedroom, refusing to see anybody, or to\nwrite to her friends, clenching her teeth, and waiting, alone, for\ndeath.\n",
                "He was obsessed by these ideas and avoided the company present: and he\nwithdrew into a little room apart: he stood leaning against the wall in\na recess that was half in darkness, behind a curtain of evergreens and\nflowers, listening to Philomela's lovely voice, with its elegiac warmth,\nsinging _The Lime-tree_ of Schubert: and the pure music called up\nsad memories. Facing him on the wall was a large mirror which reflected\nthe lights and the life of the next room. He did not see it: he was\ngazing in upon himself: and the mist of tears swam before his eyes....\nSuddenly, like Schubert's rustling tree, he began to tremble for no\nreason. He stood so for a few seconds, very pale, unable to move. Then\nthe veil fell from before his eyes, and he saw in the mirror in front of\nhim his \"friend,\" gazing at him.... His \"friend\"? Who was she? He knew\nnothing save that she was his friend and that he knew her: and he stood\nleaning against the wall, his eyes meeting hers, and he trembled. She\nsmiled. He could not see the lines of her face or her body, nor the\nexpression in her eyes, nor whether she was tall or short, nor how she\nwas dressed. Only one thing he saw: the divine goodness of her smile of\ncompassion.\n",
                "And suddenly her smile conjured up in Christophe an old forgotten memory\nof his early childhood.... He was six or seven, at school, unhappy: he\nhad just been humiliated and bullied by some older, stronger boys, and\nthey were all jeering at him, and the master had punished him unjustly:\nhe was crouching in a corner, utterly forlorn, while the others were\nplaying: and he wept softly. There was a sad-faced little girl who was\nnot playing with the others,--(he could see her now, though he had never\nthought of her since then; she was short, and had a big head, fair,\nalmost white hair and eyebrows, very pale blue eyes, broad white cheeks,\nthick lips, a rather puffy face, and small red hands),--and she came\nclose up to him, then stopped, with her thumb in her mouth and stood\nwatching him cry: then she laid her little hand on Christophe's head and\nsaid hurriedly and shyly, with just the same smile of compassion:\n",
                "\"Don't cry! Don't cry!\"\n",
                "Then Christophe could not control himself any longer, and he burst into\nsobs, and buried his face in the little girl's pinafore, while, in a\nquavering, tender voice, she went on saying:\n",
                "\"Don't cry....\"\n",
                "She died soon afterwards, a few weeks perhaps: the hand of death must\nhave been upon her at the time of that little scene.... Why should he\nthink of her now? There was no connection between the child who was dead\nand forgotten, the humble daughter of the people in a distant German\ntown, and the aristocratic young lady who was gazing at him now. But\nthere is only one soul for all: and although millions of human beings\nseem to be all different one from another, different as the worlds\nmoving in the heavens, it is the same flash of thought or love which\nlights up the hearts of men and women though centuries divide them.\nChristophe had just seen once more the light that he had seen shining\nupon the pale lips of the little comforter....\n",
                "It was all over in a second. A throng of people filled the door and shut\nout Christophe's view of the other room. He stepped back quickly into\nthe shade, out of sight of the mirror: he was afraid lest his emotion\nshould be noticed. But when he was calm again he wanted to see her once\nmore. He was afraid she would be gone. He went into the room and he\nfound her at once in the crowd, although she did not look in the least\nlike what he had seen in the mirror. Now he saw her in profile sitting\nin a group of finely dressed ladies: her elbow was resting on the arm of\nher chair, she was leaning forward a little, with her head in her hand,\nand listening to what they were saying with an intelligent absent smile:\nshe had the expression and features of the young St. John, listening and\nlooking through half-closed eyes, and smiling at his own thoughts, of\n_The Dispute_ of Raphael.... Then she raised her eyes, saw him, and\nshowed no surprise. And he saw that her smile was for himself. He was\nmuch moved, and bowed, and went up to her.\n",
                "\"You don't recognize me?\" she said.\n",
                "He knew her again that very moment.\n",
                "\"Grazia\".... he said. [Footnote: See \"Jean-Christophe in Paris: The\nMarket Place.\"]\n",
                "At the same moment the ambassador's wife passed by, and smiled with\npleasure to see that the long-sought meeting had at last come about: and\nshe introduced Christophe to \"Countess Ber\u00e9ny.\" But Christophe was so\nmoved that he did not even hear her, and he did not notice, the new\nname. She was still his little Grazia to him.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Grazia was twenty-two. She had been married for a year to a young\nattach\u00e9 of the Austrian Embassy, a nobleman, a member of a great family,\nrelated to one of the Emperor's chief ministers, a snob, a man of the\nworld, smart, prematurely worn out; with whom she had been genuinely in\nlove, while she still loved him, though she judged him. Her old father\nwas dead. Her husband had been appointed to the Embassy in Paris.\nThrough Count Ber\u00e9ny's influence, and her own charm and intelligence,\nthe timid little girl, whom the smallest thing used to set in a flutter,\nhad become one of the best-known women in Parisian society, though she\ndid nothing to procure that distinction, which embarrassed her not at\nall. It is a great thing to be young and pretty, and to give pleasure,\nand to know it. And it is a thing no less great to have a tranquil\nheart, sound and serene, which can find happiness in the harmonious\ncoincidence of its desires and its fate. The lonely flower of her life\nhad unfolded its petals: but she had lost some of the calm music of her\nLatin soul, fed by the light and the mighty peace of Italy. Quite\nnaturally she had acquired a certain influence in Parisian society: it\ndid not surprise her, and she was discreet and adroit in using it to\nfurther the artistic or charitable movements which turned to her for aid:\nshe left the official patronage of these movements to others: for\nalthough she could well maintain her rank, she had preserved a secret\nindependence from the days of her rather wild childish days in the\nlonely villa in the midst of the fields, and society wearied while it\namused her, though she always disguised her boredom by the amiable smile\nof a courteous and kind heart.\n",
                "She had not forgotten her great friend Christophe. No doubt there was\nnothing left of the child in whom an innocent love had burned in\nsilence. This new Grazia was a very sensible woman, not at all given to\nromance. She regarded the exaggerations of her childish tenderness with\na gentle irony. And yet she was always moved by the memory of it. The\nthought of Christophe was associated with the purest hours of her life.\nShe could not hear his name spoken without feeling pleasure: and each of\nhis successes delighted her as though she had shared in it herself: for\nshe had felt that they must come to him. As soon as she arrived in Paris\nshe tried to meet him again. She had invited him to her house, and had\nappended her maiden name to her letter. Christophe had paid no attention\nto it, and had flung the invitation into the waste-paper basket\nunanswered. She was not offended. She had gone on following his doings\nand, to a certain extent, his life, without his knowing it. It was she\nwhose helping hand had come to his aid in the recent campaign against\nhim in the papers. Grazia was in all things correct and had hardly\nany connection with the world of the Press: but when it came to doing a\nfriend a service, she was capable of a malicious cunning in wheedling\nthe people whom she most disliked. She invited the editor of the paper\nwhich was leading the snarling pack, to her house: and in less than no\ntime she turned his head: she skilfully flattered his vanity: and she\ngained such an ascendancy over him, while she overawed him, that it\nneeded only a few careless words of contemptuous astonishment at the\nattacks on Christophe for the campaign to be stopped short. The editor\nsuppressed the insulting article which was to appear next day: and when\nthe writer asked why it was suppressed he rated him soundly. He did\nmore: he gave orders to one of his factotums to turn out an enthusiastic\narticle about Christophe within a fortnight: the article was turned out\nto order; it was enthusiastic and stupid. It was Grazia, too, who\nthought of organizing performances of her friend's music at the Embassy,\nand, knowing that he was interested in C\u00e9cile, helped her to make her\nname. And finally, through her influence among the German diplomatists,\nshe began gently, quietly, and adroitly to awaken the interest of the\npowers that be in Christophe, who was banished from Germany: and little\nby little she did create a current of opinion directed towards obtaining\nfrom the Emperor a decree reopening the gates of his country to a great\nartist who was an honor to it. And though it was too soon to expect such\nan act of grace, she did at least succeed in procuring an undertaking\nthat the Government would close its eyes to his two days' visit to his\nnative town.\n",
                "And Christophe, who was conscious of the presence of his invisible\nfriend hovering about him without being able to find out who she was, at\nlast recognized her in the young St. John whose eyes smiled at him in\nthe mirror.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "They talked of the past. Christophe hardly knew what they said. A man\nhears the woman he loves just as little as he sees her. He loves her.\nAnd when a man really loves he never even thinks whether he is loved or\nno. Christophe never doubted it. She was there: that was enough. All the\nrest had ceased to exist....\n",
                "Grazia stopped speaking. A very tall young man, quite handsome,\nwell-dressed, clean-shaven, partly bald, with a bored, contemptuous\nmanner, stood appraising Christophe through his eye-glass, and then\nbowed with haughty politeness.\n",
                "\"My husband,\" said she.\n",
                "The clatter and chatter of the room rushed back to his ears. The inward\nlight died down. Christophe was frozen, said nothing, bowed, and\nwithdrew at once.\n",
                "How ridiculous and consuming are the unreasonable demands of the souls\nof artists and the childish laws which govern their passionate lives!\nHardly had he once more found the friend whom he had neglected in the\nold days when she loved him, while he had not thought of her for years,\nthan it seemed to him that she was his, his very own, and that if\nanother man had taken her he had stolen her from him: and she herself\nhad no right to give herself to another. Christophe did not know clearly\nwhat was happening to him. But his creative daimon knew it perfectly,\nand in those days begat some of his loveliest songs of sorrowful love.\n",
                "Some time passed before he saw her again. He was obsessed by thoughts of\nOlivier's troubles and his health. At last one day he came upon the\naddress she had given him and he made up his mind to call on her.\n",
                "As he went up the steps he heard the sound of workmen hammering. The\nanteroom was in disorder and littered with boxes and trunks. The footman\nreplied that the Countess was not at home. But as Christophe was\ndisappointedly going away after leaving his card, the servant ran after\nhim and asked him to come in and begged his pardon. Christophe was shown\ninto a little room in which the carpets had been rolled up and taken\naway. Grazia came towards him with her bright smile and her hand held\nout impulsively and gladly. All his foolish rancor vanished. He took her\nhand with the same happy impulsiveness and kissed it.\n",
                "\"Ah!\" she said, \"I am glad you came! I was so afraid I should have to go\naway without seeing you again!\"\n",
                "\"Go away? You are going away!\"\n",
                "Once more darkness descended upon him.\n",
                "\"You see....\" she said, pointing to the litter in the room. \"We are\nleaving Paris at the end of the week.\"\n",
                "\"For long?\"\n",
                "She shrugged:\n",
                "\"Who knows?\"\n",
                "He tried to speak. But his throat was dry.\n",
                "\"Where are you going?\"\n",
                "\"To the United States. My husband has been appointed first secretary to\nthe Embassy.\"\n",
                "\"And so, and so....\" he said ... (his lips trembled) ... \"it is all\nover?\"\n",
                "\"My dear friend!\" she said, touched by his tone.... \"No: it is not all\nover.\"\n",
                "\"I have found you again only to lose you?\"\n",
                "There were tears in her eyes.\n",
                "\"My dear friend,\" she said again.\n",
                "He held his hand over his eyes and turned away to hide his emotion.\n",
                "\"Do not be so sad,\" she said, laying her hand on his.\n",
                "Once more, just then, he thought of the little girl in Germany. They\nwere silent.\n",
                "\"Why did you come so late?\" she asked at last, \"I tried to find you. You\nnever replied.\"\n",
                "\"I did not know. I did not know,\" he said.... \"Tell me, was it you who\ncame to my aid so many times without my guessing who it was?... Do I owe\nit to you that I was able to go back to Germany? Were you my good angel,\nwatching over me?\"\n",
                "She said:\n",
                "\"I was glad to be able to do something for you. I owe you so much!\"\n",
                "\"What do you owe?\" he asked. \"I have done nothing for you.\"\n",

                "She spoke of the days when she was a little girl and met him at the\nhouse of her uncle, Stevens, and he had given her through his music the\nrevelation of all that is beautiful in the world. And little by little,\nwith growing animation she told him with brief allusions, that were both\nveiled and transparent, of her childish feeling for him, and the way in\nwhich she had shared Christophe's troubles, and the concert at which he\nhad been hissed, and she had wept, and the letter she had written and he\nhad never answered: for he had not received it. And as Christophe\nlistened to her, in all good faith, he projected his actual emotion and\nthe tenderness he felt for the tender face so near his own into the\npast.\n",
                "They talked innocently, fondly, and joyously. And, as he talked,\nChristophe took Grazia's hand. And suddenly they both stopped: for\nGrazia saw that Christophe loved her. And Christophe saw it too....\n",
                "For some time Grazia had loved Christophe without Christophe knowing or\ncaring. Now Christophe loved Grazia: and Grazia had nothing for him but\ncalm friendship: she loved another man. As so often happens, one of the\ntwo clocks of their lives was a little faster than the other, and it was\nenough to have changed the course of both their lives....\n",
                "Grazia withdrew her hand, and Christophe did not stay her. And they sat\nthere for a moment, mum, without a word.\n",
                "And Grazia said:\n",
                "\"Good-bye.\"\n",
                "Christophe said plaintively once more:\n",
                "\"And it is all over?\"\n",
                "\"No doubt it is better that it should be so.\"\n",
                "\"We shall not meet again before you go.\"\n",
                "\"No,\" she said.\n",
                "\"When shall we meet again?\"\n",
                "She made a sad little gesture of doubt.\n",
                "\"Then,\" said Christophe, \"what's the good, what's the good of our having\nmet again?\"\n",
                "Her eyes reproached him, and he said quickly:\n",
                "\"No. Forgive me. I am unjust.\"\n",
                "\"I shall always think of you,\" said she.\n",
                "\"Alas!\" he replied, \"I cannot even think of you. I know nothing of your\nlife.\"\n",
                "Very quietly she described her ordinary life in a few words and told him\nhow her days were spent. She spoke of herself and of her husband with\nher lovely affectionate smile.\n",
                "\"Ah!\" he said jealously. \"You love him?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said.\nHe got up.\n",
                "\"Good-bye.\"\n",
                "She got up too. Then only he saw that she was with child. And in his\nheart there was an inexpressible feeling of disgust, and tenderness, and\njealousy, and passionate pity. She walked with him to the door of the\nlittle room. There he turned, bent over her hands, and kissed them\nfervently. She stood there with her eyes half closed and did not stir.\nAt last he drew himself up, turned, and hurried away without looking at\nher.\n",
                "    ... _E chi allora m'avesse domandalo di cosa alcuna, la mia\n    risponsione sarebbe stata solamente AMORE, con viso vestito\n    d'umilt\u00e0_....\n",
                "All Saints' Day. Outside, a gray light and a cold wind. Christophe was\nwith C\u00e9cile, who was sitting near the cradle, and Madame Arnaud was\nbending over it. She had dropped in. Christophe was dreaming. He was\nfeeling that he had missed happiness: but he never thought of\ncomplaining: he knew that happiness existed.... Oh! sun, I have no need\nto see thee to love thee! Through the long winter days, when I shiver in\nthe darkness, my heart is full of thee: my love keeps me warm: I know\nthat thou art there....\n",
                "And C\u00e9cile was dreaming too. She was pondering the child, and she had\ncome to believe that it was indeed her own. Oh, blessed power of dreams,\nthe creative imagination of life! Life.... What is life? It is not as\ncold reason and our eyes tell us that it is. Life is what we dream, and\nthe measure of life is love.\n",
                "Christophe gazed at C\u00e9cile, whose peasant face with its wide-set eyes\nshone with the splendor of the maternal instinct,--she was more a mother\nthan the real mother. And he looked at the tender weary face of Madame\nArnaud. In it, as in books that moved him, he read the hidden sweetness\nand suffering of the life of a married woman which, though none ever\nsuspects it, is sometimes as rich in sorrow and joy as the love of\nJuliet or Ysolde: though it touches a greater height of religious\nfeeling ....\n",
                "  _Socia rei human\u00e6 atque divin\u00e6...._\n",
                "And he thought that children or the lack of children has as much to do\nwith the happiness or unhappiness of those who marry and those who do\nnot marry as faith and the lack of faith. Happiness is the perfume of\nthe soul, the harmony that dwells, singing, in the depths of the heart.\nAnd the most beautiful of all the music of the soul is kindness.\n",
                "Olivier came in. He was quite calm and reposeful in his movements: a new\nserenity shone in him. He smiled at the child, shook hands with C\u00e9cile\nand Madame Arnaud, and began to talk quietly. He watched them with a\nsort of surprised affection. He was no longer the same. In the isolation\nin which he had shut himself up with his grief, like a caterpillar in\nthe nest of its own spinning, he had succeeded after a hard struggle in\nthrowing off his sorrow like an empty shell. Some day we shall tell how\nhe thought he had found a fine cause to which to devote his life, in\nwhich he had no interest save that of sacrifice: and, as it is ordered,\non the very day when in his heart he had come to a definite renunciation\nof life, it was kindled once more. His friends looked at him. They did\nnot know what had happened, and dared not ask him: but they felt that he\nwas free once more, and that there was in him neither regret nor\nbitterness for anything or against anybody in the whole wide world.\n",
                "Christophe got up and went to the piano, and said to Olivier:\n",
                "\"Would you like me to sing you a melody of Brahms?\"\n",
                "\"Brahms?\" said Olivier. \"Do you play your old enemy's music nowadays?\"\n",
                "\"It is All Saints' Day,\" said Christophe. \"The day when all are\nforgiven.\"\n",
                "Softly, so as not to wake the child, he sang a few bars of the old\nSchwabian folk-song:\n",

                "Christophe was at rest: peace was his. He was in a certain measure proud\nof having conquered it: but secretly, in his heart of hearts, he was\nsorry for it. He was amazed at the silence. His passions were\nslumbering: in all good faith he thought that they would never wake\nagain.\n",
                "The mighty, somewhat brutal force that was his was browsing listlessly\nand aimlessly. In his inmost soul there was a secret void, a hidden\nquestion: \"What's the good?\": perhaps a certain consciousness of the\nhappiness which he had failed to grasp. He had not force enough to\nstruggle either with himself or with others. He had come to the end of a\nstage in his progress: he was reaping the fruits of all his former\nefforts, cumulatively: too easily he was tapping the vein of music that\nhe had opened and while the public was naturally behindhand, and was\njust discovering and admiring his old work, he was beginning to break\naway from them without knowing as yet whether he would be able to make\nany advance on them. He had now a uniform and even delight in creation.\nAt this period of his life art was to him no more than a fine instrument\nupon which he played like a virtuoso. He was ashamedly conscious of\nbecoming a dilettante.\n",
                "\"_If_,\" said Ibsen, \"_a man is to persevere in his art; he must\nhave something else, something more than his native genius: passions,\nsorrows, which shall fill his life and give it a direction. Otherwise he\nwill not create, he will write books.\"_\n",
                "Christophe was writing books. He was not used to it. His books were\nbeautiful. He would have rather had them less beautiful and more alive.\nHe was like an athlete resting, not knowing to what use to turn his\nmuscles, and, yawning in boredom like a caged wild beast, he sat looking\nahead at the years and years of peaceful work that awaited him. And as,\nwith his old German capacity for optimism, he had no difficulty in\npersuading himself that everything was for the best, he thought that\nsuch a future was no doubt the appointed inevitable end: he flattered\nhimself that he had issued from his time of trial and tribulation and\nhad become master of himself. That was not saying much.... Oh, well! A\nman is sovereign over that which is his, he is what he is capable of\nbeing.... He thought that he had reached his haven.\n",
                "The two friends were not living together. After Jacqueline's flight,\nChristophe had thought that Olivier would come back and take up his old\nquarters with him. But Olivier could not. Although he felt keenly the\nneed of intimacy with Christophe, yet he was conscious of the\nimpossibility of resuming their old existence together. After the years\nlived with Jacqueline, it would have seemed intolerable and even\nsacrilegious to admit another human being to his most intimate\nlife,--even though he loved and were loved by that other a thousand\ntimes more than Jacqueline.--There was no room for argument.\n",
                "Christophe had found it hard to understand. He returned again and again\nto the charge, he was surprised, saddened, hurt, and angry. Then his\ninstinct, which was finer and quicker than his intelligence, bade him\ntake heed. Suddenly he ceased, and admitted that Olivier was right.\n",
                "But they saw each other every day: and they had never been so closely\nunited even when they were living under the same roof. Perhaps they did\nnot exchange their most intimate thoughts when they talked. They did not\nneed to do so. The exchange was made naturally, without need of words,\nby grace of the love that was in their hearts.\n",
                "They talked very little, for each was absorbed: one in his art, the other\nin his memories. Olivier's sorrow was growing less: but he did\nnothing to mitigate it, rather almost taking a pleasure in it: for a\nlong time it had been his only reason for living. He loved his child:\nbut his child--a puling baby--could occupy no great room in his life.\nThere are men who are more lovers than fathers, and it is useless to cry\nout against them. Nature is not uniform, and it would be absurd to try\nto impose identical laws upon the hearts of all men. No man has the\nright to sacrifice his duty to his heart. At least the heart must be\ngranted the right to be unhappy where a man does his duty. What Olivier\nperhaps most loved in his child was the woman of whose body it was made.\n",
                "Until quite recently he had paid little attention to the sufferings of\nothers. He was an intellectual living too much shut up in himself. It\nwas not egoism so much as a morbid habit of dreaming. Jacqueline had\nincreased the void about him: her love had traced a magic circle about\nOlivier to cut him off from other men, and the circle endured after love\nhad ceased to be. In addition he was a little aristocratic by temper.\nFrom his childhood on, in spite of his soft heart, he had held aloof\nfrom the mob for reasons rooted in the delicacy of his body and his\nsoul. The smell of the people and their thoughts were repulsive to him.\n",
                "But everything had changed as the result of a commonplace tragedy which\nhe had lately witnessed.\n",

                "He had taken a very modest lodging at the top of the Mont-rouge quarter,\nnot far from Christophe and C\u00e9cile. The district was rather common, and\nthe house in which he lived was occupied by little gentlepeople, clerks,\nand a few working-class families. At any other time he would have suffered\nfrom such surroundings in which he moved as a stranger: but now\nit mattered very little to him where he was: he felt that he was a\nstranger everywhere. He hardly knew and did not want to know who his\nneighbors were. When he returned from his work--(he had gone into a\npublishing-house)--he withdrew into his memories, and would only go out\nto see his child and Christophe. His lodging was not home to him: it was\nthe dark room in which the images of the past took shape and dwelling:\nthe darker it was the more clearly did the inward images emerge. He\nscarcely noticed the faces of those he passed on the stairs. And yet\nunconsciously he was aware of certain faces that were impressed upon his\nmind. There is a certain order of mind which only really sees things\nafter they have passed. But then, nothing escapes them, the smallest\ndetails are graven on the plate. Olivier's was such a mind: he bore\nwithin himself multitudes of the shadowy shapes of the living. With any\nemotional shock they would come mounting up in crowds: and Olivier would\nbe amazed to recognize those whom he had never known, and sometimes he\nwould hold out his hands to grasp them.... Too late.\n",
                "One day as he came out of his rooms he saw a little crowd collected in\nfront of the house-door round the housekeeper, who was making a\nharangue. He was so little interested that he was for going his way\nwithout troubling to find out what was the matter: but the housekeeper,\nanxious to gain another listener, stopped him, and asked him if he knew\nwhat had happened to the poor Roussels. Olivier did not even know who\n\"the poor Roussels\" were, and he listened with polite indifference. When\nhe heard that a working-class family, father, mother, and five children,\nhad committed suicide to escape from poverty in the house in which he\nlived, he stopped, like the rest, and looked up at the walls of the\nbuilding, and listened to the woman's story, which she was nothing loth\nto begin again from the beginning. As she went on talking, old memories\nawoke in him, and he realized that he had seen the wretched family: he\nasked a few questions.... Yes, he remembered them: the man--(he used to\nhear him breathing noisily on the stairs)--a journeyman baker, with a\npale face, all the blood drawn out of it by the heat of the oven, hollow\ncheeks always ill shaven: he had had pneumonia at the beginning of the\nwinter: he had gone back to work only half cured: he had had a relapse:\nfor the last three weeks he had had no work and no strength. The woman\nhad dragged from childbirth to childbirth: crippled with rheumatism, she\nhad worn herself out in trying to make both ends meet, and had spent her\ndays running hither and thither trying to obtain from the Public Charity\na meager sum which was not readily forthcoming. Meanwhile the children\ncame, and went on coming: eleven, seven, three--not to mention two others\nwho had died in between:--and, to crown all, twins who had chosen\nthe very dire moment to make their appearance: they had been born only\nthe month before.\n",
                "--On the day of their birth, a neighbor said, the eldest of the five, a\nlittle girl of eleven, Justine--poor little mite!--had begun to cry and\nasked how ever she could manage to carry both of them.\n",
                "Olivier at once remembered the little girl,--a large forehead, with\ncolorless hair pulled back, and sorrowful, gray bulging eyes. He was\nalways meeting her, carrying provisions or her little sister: or she\nwould be holding her seven-year-old brother by the hand, a little\npinch-faced, cringing boy he was, with one blind eye. When they met on\nthe stairs Olivier used to say, with his absent courteous manner:\n",
                "\"Pardon, mademoiselle.\"\n",
                "But she never said anything: she used to go stiffly by, hardly moving\naside: but his illusory courtesy used to give her a secret pleasure.\nOnly the evening before, at six o'clock, as he was going downstairs, he\nhad met her for the last time: she was carrying up a bucket of charcoal.\nHe had not noticed it, except that he did remark that the burden seemed\nto be very heavy. But that is merely in the order of things for the\nchildren of the people. Olivier had bowed, as usual, without looking at\nher. A few steps lower down he had mechanically looked up to see her\nleaning over the balustrade of the landing, with her little pinched\nface, watching him go down. She turned away at once, and resumed her\nclimb upstairs. Did she know whither she was climbing?--Olivier had no\ndoubt that she did, and he was obsessed by the thought of the child\nbearing death in the load that was too heavy for her, death the\ndeliverer--the wretched children for whom to cease to be meant an end of\nsuffering! He was unable to continue his walk. He went back to his room.\nBut there he was conscious of the proximity of the dead.... Only a few\nthin walls between him and them.... To think that he had lived so near\nto such misery!\n",
                "He went to see Christophe. He was sick at heart: he told himself that it\nwas monstrous for him to have been so absorbed as he had been in vain\nregrets for love while there were so many creatures suffering\nmisfortunes a thousand times more cruel, and it was possible to help and\nsave them. His emotion was profound: there was no difficulty In\ncommunicating it. Christophe was easily impressionable, and he in his\nturn was moved. When he heard Olivier's story he tore up the page of\nmusic he had just been writing, and called himself a selfish brute to be\namusing himself with childish games. But, directly after, he picked up\nthe pieces. He was too much under the spell of his music. And his\ninstinct told him that a work of art the less would not make one happy\nman the more. The tragedy of want was no new thing to him: from his\nchildhood on he had been used to treading on the edge of such abysmal\ndepths, and contriving not to topple over. But he was apt to judge\nsuicide harshly, being conscious as he was of such a fullness of force,\nand unable to understand how a man, under the pressure of any suffering\nwhatsoever, could give up the struggle. Suffering, struggling, is there\nanything more normal? These things are the backbone of the universe.\n",
                "Olivier also had passed through much the same sort of experience: but he\nhad never been able to resign himself to it, either on his own account\nor for others. He had a horror of the poverty in which the life of his\nbeloved Antoinette had been consumed. After his marriage with\nJacqueline, when he had suffered the softening influence of riches and\nlove, he had made haste to thrust back the memory of the sorrowful years\nwhen he and his sister had worn themselves out each day in the struggle\nto gain the right to live through the next, never knowing whether they\nwould succeed or no. The memories of those days would come to him now\nthat he no longer had his youthful egoism to preserve. Instead of flying\nbefore the face of suffering he set out to look for it. He did not need\nto go far to find it. In the state of mind in which he was he was prone\nto find it everywhere. The world was full of it, the world, that\nhospital.... Oh, the agony, the sorrow! Pains of the wounded body,\nquivering flesh, rotting away in life. The silent torture of hearts\nunder gnawing grief. Children whom no one loves, poor hopeless girls,\nwomen seduced or betrayed, men deceived in their friends, their loves,\ntheir faith, the pitiable herd of the unfortunates whom life has broken\nand forgotten!... Not poverty and sickness were the most frightful\nthings to see, but the cruelty of men one to another. Hardly had Olivier\nraised the cover of the hell of humanity than there rose to his ears the\nplaint of all the oppressed, the exploited poor, the persecuted peoples,\nmassacred Armenians, Finland crushed and stifled, Poland rent in pieces,\nRussia martyred, Africa flung to the rapacious pack of Europe, all the\nwretched creatures of the human race. It stifled him: he heard it\neverywhere, he could no longer close his ears to it, he could no longer\nconceive the possibility of there being people with any other thought.\nHe was for ever talking about it to Christophe. Christophe grew anxious,\nand said:\n",
                "\"Be quiet! Let me work.\"\n",
                "And as he found it hard to recover his balance he would lose his temper\nand swear.\n",
                "\"Damnation! My day is wasted! And you're a deal the better for it,\naren't you?\"\n",
                "Olivier would beg his pardon.\n",
                "\"My dear fellow,\" said Christophe, \"it's no good always looking down\ninto the pit. It stops your living.\"\n",
                "\"One must lend a hand to those who are in the pit.\"\n",
                "\"No doubt. But how? By flinging ourselves down as well? For that is what\nyou want. You've got a propensity for seeing nothing but the sad side of\nlife. God bless you! Your pessimism is charitable, I grant you, but it\nis very depressing. Do you want to create happiness? Very well, then, be\nhappy.\"\n",
                "\"Happy! How can one have the heart to be happy when one sees so much\nsuffering? There can only be happiness in trying to lessen it and\nfighting the evil.\"\n",
                "\"Very good. But I don't help the unfortunate much by lashing out blindly\nin all directions. It means only one bad soldier the more. But I can\nbring comfort by my art and spread force and joy. Have you any idea how\nmany wretched beings have been sustained in their suffering by the\nbeauty of an idea, by a winged song? Every man to his own trade! You\nFrench people, like the generous scatterbrains that you are, are always\nthe first to protest against the injustice of, say, Spain or Russia,\nwithout knowing what it is all about. I love you for it. But do you\nthink you are helping things along? You rush at it and bungle it and the\nresult is nil,--if not worse.... And, look you, your art has never been\nmore weak and emaciated than now, when your artists claim to be taking\npart in the activities of the world. It is the strangest thing to see so\nmany little writers and artists, all dilettante and rather dishonest,\ndaring to set themselves up as apostles! They would do much better if\nthey were to give the people wine to drink that was not so\nadulterated.--My first duty is to do whatever I am doing well, and to\ngive you healthy music which shall set new blood coursing in your veins\nand let the sun shine in upon you.\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "If a man is to shed the light of the sun upon other men, he must first\nof all have it within himself. Olivier had none of it. Like the best man\nof to-day, he was not strong enough to radiate force by himself. But in\nunison with others he might have been able to do so. But with whom could\nhe unite? He was free in mind and at heart religious, and he was\nrejected by every party political and religious. They were all\nintolerant and narrow and were continually at rivalry. Whenever they\ncame into power they abused it. Only the weak and the oppressed\nattracted Olivier. In this at least he agreed with Christophe's opinion,\nthat before setting out to combat injustice in distant lands, it were as\nwell to fight injustice close at hand, injustice everywhere about,\ninjustice for which each and every man is more or less responsible.\nThere are only too many people who are quite satisfied with protesting\nagainst the evil wrought by others, without ever thinking of the evil\nthat they do themselves.\n",
                "At first he turned his attention to the relief of the poor. His friend,\nMadame Arnaud, helped to administer a charity. Olivier got her to allow\nhim to help. But at the outset he had more than one setback: the poor\npeople who were given into his charge were not all worthy of interest,\nor they were unresponsive to his sympathy, distrusted him, and shut\ntheir doors against him. Besides, it is hard for a man of intellect to\nbe satisfied with charity pure and simple: it waters such a very small\ncorner of the kingdom of wretchedness! Its effects are almost always\npiecemeal, fragmentary: it seems to move by chance, and to be engaged\nonly in dressing wounds as fast as it discovers them: generally it is\ntoo modest and in too great a hurry to probe down to the roots of the\nevil. Now it was just this probing that Olivier's mind found\nindispensable.\n",
                "He began to study the problem of social poverty. There was no lack of\nguides to point the way. In those days the social question had become a\nsociety question. It was discussed in drawing-rooms, in the theater, in\nnovels. Everybody claimed some knowledge of it. Some of the young men\nwere expending the best part of their powers upon it.\n",
                "Every new generation needs to have some splendid mania or other. Even\nthe most selfish of young people are endowed with a superfluity of life,\na capital sum of energy which has been advanced to them and cannot be\nleft idle and unproductive: they are for ever seeking to expend it on a\ncourse of action, or--(more prudently)--on a theory. Aviation or\nRevolution, a muscular or intellectual exercise. When a man is young he\nneeds to be under the illusion that he is sharing in some great movement\nof humanity and is renewing the life of the world. It is a lovely thing\nwhen the senses thrill in answer to every puff of the winds of the\nuniverse! Then a man is so free, so light! Not yet is he laden with the\nballast of a family, he has nothing, risks next to nothing. A man is\nvery generous when he can renounce what is not yet his. Besides, it is\nso good to love and to hate, and to believe that one is transforming the\nearth with dreams and shouting! Young people are like watch-dogs: they\nare for ever howling and barking at the wind. An act of injustice\ncommitted at the other end of the world will send them off their heads.\n",
                "Dogs barking through the night. From one farm to another in the heart of\nthe forest they were yelping to one another, never ceasing. The night\nwas stormy. It was not easy to sleep in those days. The wind bore\nthrough the air the echoes of so many acts of injustice!... The tale of\ninjustice is unnumbered: in remedying one there is danger of causing\nothers. What is injustice?--To one man it means a shameful peace, the\nfatherland dismembered. To another it signifies war. To another it means\nthe destruction of the past, the banishment of princes: to another, the\nspoliation of the Church: to yet another the stifling of the future to\nthe peril of liberty. For the people, injustice lies in inequality: for\nthe upper ten, in equality. There are so many different kinds of\ninjustice that each age chooses its own,--the injustice that it fights\nagainst, and the injustice that it countenances.\n",
                "At the present time the mightiest efforts of the world were directed\nagainst social injustice,--and unconsciously were tending to the\nproduction of fresh injustice.\n",
                "And, in truth, such injustice had waxed great and plain to see since the\nworking-classes, growing in numbers and power, had become part of the\nessential machinery of the State. But in spite of the declamations of\nthe tribunes and bards of the people, their condition was not worse, but\nrather better than it had ever been in the past: and the change had come\nabout not because they suffered more, but because they had grown\nstronger. Stronger by reason of the very power of the hostile ranks of\nCapital, by the fatality of economic and industrial development which\nhad banded the workers together in armies ready for the fight, and, by\nthe use of machinery, had given weapons into their hands, and had turned\nevery foreman into a master with power over light, lightning, movement,\nall the energy of the world. From this enormous mass of elementary\nforces, which only a short time ago the leaders of men were trying to\norganize, there was given out a white heat, electric waves gradually\npermeating the whole body of human society.\n",
                "It was not by reason of its justice, or its novelty, or the force of the\nideas bound up in it that the cause of the people was stirring the minds\nof the intelligent middle-class, although they were fain to think so.\nIts appeal lay in its vitality.\n",
                "Its justice? Justice was everywhere and every day violated thousands of\ntimes without the world ever giving a thought to it. Its ideas? Scraps\nof truth, picked up here and there and adjusted to the interests and\nrequirements of one class at the expense of the other classes. Its creed\nwas as absurd as every other creed,--the Divine Right of Kings, the\nInfallibility of the Popes, Universal Suffrage, the Equality of\nMan,--all equally absurd if one only considers them by their rational\nvalue and not in the light of the force by which they are animated. What\ndid their mediocrity matter? Ideas have never conquered the world as\nideas, but only by the force they represent. They do not grip men by\ntheir intellectual contents, but by the radiant vitality which is given\noff from them at certain periods in history. They give off as it were a\nrich scent which overpowers even the dullest sense of smell. The\nloftiest and most sublime idea remains ineffective until the day when it\nbecomes contagious, not by its own merits, but by the merits of the\ngroups of men in whom it becomes incarnate by the transfusion of their\nblood. Then the withered plant, the rose of Jericho, comes suddenly to\nflower, grows to its full height, and fills all the air with its\npowerful aroma.--Some of the ideas which were now the flaming standard\nunder which the working-classes were marching on to the assault upon the\ncapitalistic citadel, emanated from the brains of dreamers of the\ncomfortable classes. While they had been left in their comfortable\nbooks, they had lain dead: items in a museum, mummies packed away in\nglass cases with no one to look at them. But as soon as the people laid\nhands on them, they had become part and parcel of the people, they had\nbeen given their feverish reality, which deformed them while it gave\nthem life, breathing into such abstract reason, their hallucinations,\nand their hopes, like a burning wind of Hegira. They were quickly spread\nfrom man to man. Men succumbed to them without knowing from whom they\ncame or how they had been brought. They were no respecters of persons.\nThe moral epidemic spread and spread: and it was quite possible for\nlimited creatures to communicate it to superior men. Every man was\nunwittingly an agent in the transmission.\n",
                "Such phenomena of intellectual contagion are to be observed in all times\nand in all countries: they make themselves felt even in aristocratic\nStates where there is the endeavor to maintain castes hermetically\nsealed one against the other. But nowhere are they more electric than in\ndemocracies which preserve no sanitary barrier between the elect and the\nmob. The elect are contaminated at once whatever they do to fight\nagainst it. In spite of their pride and intelligence they cannot resist\nthe contagion; for the elect are much weaker than they think.\nIntelligence is a little island fretted by the tides of humanity,\ncrumbling away and at last engulfed. It only emerges again on the ebb of\nthe tide.--One wonders at the self-denial of the French privileged\nclasses when on the night of August 4 they abdicated their rights. Most\nwonderful of all, no doubt, is the fact that they could not do\notherwise. I fancy a good many of them when they returned home must have\nsaid to themselves: \"What have I done? I must have been drunk....\" A\nsplendid drunkenness! Blessed be wine and the vine that gives it forth!\nIt was not the privileged classes of old France who planted the vine\nwhose blood brought them to drunkenness. The wine was extracted, they\nhad only to drink it. He who drank must lose his wits. Even those who\ndid not drink turned dizzy only from the smell of the vat that caught\nthem as they passed. The vintages of the Revolution!... Hidden away in\nthe family vaults there are left only a few empty bottles of the wine of\n'89: but our grandchildren's children will remember that their\ngreat-grandfathers had their heads turned by it.\n",
                "It was a sourer wine but a wine no less strong that was mounting to the\nheads of the comfortable young people of Olivier's generation. They were\noffering up their class as a sacrifice to the new God, _Deo\nignoto_:--the people.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "To tell the truth, they were not all equally sincere. Many of them were\nonly able to see in the movement an opportunity of rising above their\nclass by affecting to despise it. For the majority it was an\nintellectual pastime, an oratorical enthusiasm which they never took\naltogether seriously. There is a certain pleasure in believing that you\nbelieve in a cause, that you are fighting, or will fight, for it,--or\nat least could fight. There is a by no means negligible satisfaction in the\nthought that you are risking something. Theatrical emotions.\n",
                "They are quite innocent so long as you surrender to them simply without\nany admixture of interested motive.--But there were men of a more\nworldly type who only played the game of set purpose: the popular\nmovement was to them only a road to success. Like the Norse pirates,\nthey made use of the rising tide to carry their ships up into the land:\nthey aimed at reaching the innermost point of the great estuaries so as\nto be left snugly ensconced in the conquered cities when the sea fell\nback once more. The channel was narrow and the tide was capricious:\ngreat skill was needed. But two or three generations of demagogy have\ncreated a race of corsairs who know every trick and secret of the trade.\nThey rushed boldly in with never even so much as a glance back at those\nwho foundered on the way.\n",
                "This piratical rabble is made up of all parties: thank Heaven, no party\nis responsible for it. But the disgust with which such adventurers had\ninspired the sincere and all men of conviction had led some of them to\ndespair of their class. Olivier came in contact with rich young men of\nculture who felt very strongly that the comfortable classes were\nmoribund and that they themselves were useless. He was only too much\ninclined to sympathize with them. They had begun by believing in the\nreformation of the people by the elect, they had founded Popular\nUniversities, and taken no account of the time and money spent upon\nthem, and now they were forced to admit the futility of their efforts:\ntheir hopes had been pitched too high, their discouragement sank too\nlow. The people had either not responded to their appeal or had run away\nfrom it. When the people did come, they understood everything all wrong,\nand only assimilated the vices and absurdities of the culture of the\nsuperior classes. And in the end more than one scurvy knave had stolen\ninto the ranks of the burgess apostles, and discredited them by\nexploiting both people and apostles at the same time. Then it seemed to\nhonest men that the middle-class was doomed, that it could only infect\nthe people who, at all costs, must break free and go their way alone. So\nthey were left cut off from all possibility of action, save to predict\nand foresee a movement which would be made without and against\nthemselves. Some of them found in this the joy of renunciation, the joy\nof deep disinterested human sympathy feeding upon itself and the\nsacrifice of itself. To love, to give self! Youth is so richly endowed\nthat it can afford to do without repayment: youth has no fear of being\nleft despoiled. And it can do without everything save the art of\nloving.--Others again found in it a pleasurable rational satisfaction, a\nsort of imperious logic: they sacrificed themselves not to men so much\nas to ideas. These were the bolder spirits. They took a proud delight in\ndeducing the fated end of their class from their reasoned arguments. It\nwould have hurt them more to see their predictions falsified than to be\ncrushed beneath the weight of circumstance. In their intellectual\nintoxication they cried aloud to those outside: \"Harder! Strike harder!\nLet there be nothing left of us!\"--They had become the theorists of\nviolence.\n",
                "Of the violence of others. For, as usual, these apostles of brute force\nwere almost always refined and weakly people. Many of them were\nofficials of the State which they talked of destroying, industrious,\nconscientious, and orderly officials.\n",
                "Their theoretical violence was the throwback from their weakness, their\nbitterness, and the suppression of their vitality. But above all it was\nan indication of the storms brewing all around them. Theorists are like\nmeteorologists: they state in scientific terms not what the weather will\nbe, but what the weather is. They are weathercocks pointing to the\nquarter whence the wind blows. When they turn they are never far from\nbelieving that they are turning the wind.\n",
                "The wind had turned.\n",
                "Ideas are quickly used up in a democracy, and the more quickly they are\npropagated, the more quickly are they worn out. There are any number of\nRepublicans in France who in less than fifty years have grown disgusted\nwith the Republic, with Universal Suffrage, with all the manifestations\nof liberty won with such blind intoxication! After the fetish worship of\nnumbers, after the gaping optimism which had believed in the sanctity of\nthe majority and had looked to it for the progress of humanity, there\ncame the wind of brute force: the inability of the majority to govern\nthemselves, their venality, their corruption, their base and fearful\nhatred of all superiority, their oppressive cowardice, raised the spirit\nof revolt: the minorities of energy--every kind of minority--appealed\nfrom the majority to force. A queer, yet inevitable alliance was brought\nabout between the royalists of the _Action Fran\u00e7aise_ and the\nsyndicalists of the C. G. T. Balzac speaks somewhere of the men of his\ntime who _\"though aristocrats by inclination, yet became Republicans\nin spite, of themselves, only to find many inferiors among their\nequals.\"_--A scant sort of pleasure. Those who are inferior must be\nmade to accept themselves as such: and to bring that about there is\nnothing to be done but to create an authority which shall impose the\nsupremacy of the elect--of either class, working or burgess--upon the\noppressive majority. Our young intellectuals, being proud and of the\nbetter class, became royalists or revolutionaries out of injured vanity\nand hatred of democratic equality. And the disinterested theorists, the\nphilosophers of brute force, like good little weathercocks, reared their\nheads above them and were the oriflammes of the storm.\n",
                "Last of all there was the herd of literary men in search of\ninspiration--men who could write and yet knew not what to write: like\nthe Greeks at Aulis, they were becalmed and could make no progress, and\nsat impatiently waiting for a kindly wind from any quarter to come and\nbelly out their sails.--There were famous men among them, men who had\nbeen wrenched away from their stylistic labors and plunged into public\nmeetings by the Dreyfus affair. An example which had found only too many\nfollowers for the liking of those who had set it. There was now a mob of\nwriting men all engrossed in politics, and claiming to control the\naffairs of the State. On the slightest excuse they would form societies,\nissue manifestoes, save the Capitol. After the intellectuals of the\nadvance guard came the intellectuals of the rear: they were much of a\nmuchness. Each of the two parties regarded the other as intellectual and\nthemselves as intelligent. Those who had the luck to have in their veins\na few drops of the blood of the people bragged about it: they dipped\ntheir pens into it, wrote with it.--They were all malcontents of the\nburgess class, and were striving to recapture the authority which that\nclass had irreparably lost through its selfishness. Only in rare\ninstances were these apostles known to keep up their apostolic zeal for\nany length of time. In the beginning the cause meant a certain amount of\nsuccess to them, success which in all probability was in no wise due to\ntheir oratorical gifts. It gave them a delicious flattery for their\nvanity. Thereafter they went on with less success and a certain secret\nfear of being rather ridiculous. In the long-run the last feeling was\napt to dominate the rest, being increased by the fatigue of playing a\ndifficult part for men of their distinguished tastes and innate\nskepticism. But they waited upon the favor of the wind and of their\nescort before they could withdraw. For they were held captive both by\nwind and escort. These latter-day Voltaires and Joseph de Maistres,\nbeneath their boldness in speech and writing, concealed a dread\nuncertainty, feeling the ground, being fearful of compromising\nthemselves with the young men, and striving hard to please them and to\nbe younger than the young. They were revolutionaries or\ncounter-revolutionaries merely as a matter of literature, and in the end\nthey resigned themselves to following the literary fashion which they\nthemselves had helped to create.\n",
                "The oddest of all the types with which Olivier came in contact in the\nsmall burgess advance guard of the Revolution was the revolutionary who\nwas so from timidity.\n",
                "The specimen presented for his immediate observation was named Pierre\nCanet. He was brought up in a rich, middle-class, and conservative\nfamily, hermetically sealed against any new idea: they were magistrates\nand officials who had distinguished themselves by crabbing authority or\nbeing dismissed: thick-witted citizens of the Marais who flirted with\nthe Church and thought little, but thought that little well. He had\nmarried, for want of anything better to do, a woman with an aristocratic\nname, who had no great capacity for thought, but did her thinking no\nless well than he. The bigoted, narrow, and retrograde society in which\nhe lived, a society which was perpetually chewing the cud of its own\nconceit and bitterness, had finally exasperated him,--the more so as his\nwife was ugly and a bore. He was fairly intelligent and open-minded, and\nliberal in aspiration, without knowing at all clearly in what liberalism\nconsisted: there was no likelihood of his discovering the meaning of\nliberty in his immediate surroundings. The only thing he knew for\ncertain was that liberty did not exist there: and he fancied that he had\nonly to leave to find it. On his first move outwards he was lucky enough\nto fall in with certain old college friends, some of whom had been\nsmitten with syndicalistic ideas. He was even more at sea in their\ncompany than in the society which he had just quitted: but he would not\nadmit it: he had to live somewhere: and he was unable to find people of\nhis own cast of thought (that is to say, people of no cast of thought\nwhatever), though, God knows, the species is by no means rare in France!\nBut they are ashamed of themselves: they hide themselves, or they take\non the hue of one of the fashionable political colors, if not of\nseveral, all at once. Besides, he was under the influence of his\nfriends.\n",
                "As always happens, he had particularly attached himself to the very man\nwho was most different from himself. This Frenchman, French, burgess and\nprovincial to his very soul, had become the _fidus Achates_ of a\nyoung Jewish doctor named Manousse Heimann, a Russian refugee, who, like\nso many of his fellow-countrymen, had the twofold gift of settling at\nonce among strangers and making himself at home, and of being so much at\nhis ease in any sort of revolution as to rouse wonder as to what it was\nthat most interested him in it: the game or the cause. His experiences\nand the experiences of others were a source of entertainment to him. He\nwas a sincere revolutionary, and his scientific habit of mind made him\nregard the revolutionaries and himself as a kind of madmen. His excited\ndilettantism and his extreme instability of mind made him seek the\ncompany of men the most opposite. He had acquaintances among those in\nauthority and even among the police: he was perpetually prying and\nspying with that morbid and dangerous curiosity which makes so many\nRussian revolutionaries seem to be playing a double game, and sometimes\nreduces the appearance to reality. It is not treachery so much as\nversatility, and it is thoroughly disinterested. There are so many men\nof action to whom action is a theater into which they bring their\ntalents as comedians, quite honestly prepared at any moment to change\ntheir part! Manousse was as faithful to the revolutionary part as it was\npossible for him to be: it was the character which was most in accord\nwith his natural anarchy, and his delight in demolishing the laws of the\ncountries through which he passed. But yet, in spite of everything, it\nwas only a part. It was always impossible to know how much was true and\nhow much invented in what he said, and even he himself was never very\nsure. He was intelligent and skeptical, endowed with the psychological\nsubtlety of his twofold nationality, could discern quite marvelously the\nweaknesses of others, and his own, and was extremely skilful in playing\nupon them, so that he had no difficulty in gaining an ascendancy over\nCanet. It amused him to drag this Sancho Panza into Quixotic pranks. He\nmade no scruple about using him, disposing of his will, his time, his\nmoney,--not for his own benefit, (he needed none, though no one knew how\nor in what way he lived),--but in the most compromising demonstrations\nof the cause. Canet submitted to it all: he tried to persuade himself\nthat he thought like Manousse. He knew perfectly well that this was not\nthe case: such ideas scared him: they were shocking to his common sense.\nAnd he had no love for the people. And, in addition, he had no courage.\nThis big, bulky, corpulent young man, with his clean-shaven pinkish face,\nhis short breathing, his pleasant, pompous, and rather childish way of\nspeaking, with a chest like the Farnese Hercules, (he was a fair hand at\nboxing and singlestick), was the most timid of men. If he took a certain\npride in being taken for a man of a subversive temper by his own people,\nin his heart of hearts he used to tremble at the boldness of his\nfriends. No doubt the little thrill they gave him was by no means\ndisagreeable as long as it was only in fun. But their fun was becoming\ndangerous. His fervent friends were growing aggressive, their hardy\npretensions were increasing: they alarmed Canet's fundamental egoism,\nhis deeply rooted sense of propriety, his middle-class pusillanimity. He\ndared not ask: \"Where are you taking me to?\" But, under his breath, he\nfretted and fumed at the recklessness of these young men who seemed to\nlove nothing so much as breaking their necks, and never to give a\nthought as to whether they were not at the same time running a risk of\nbreaking other people's.--What was it impelled him to follow them? Was\nhe not free to break with them? He had not the courage. He was afraid of\nbeing left alone, like a child who gets left behind and begins to\nwhimper. He was like so many men: they have no opinions, except in so\nfar as they disapprove of all enthusiastic opinion: but if a man is to\nbe independent he must stand alone, and how many men are there who are\ncapable of that? How many men are there, even amongst the most clear\nsighted, who will dare to break free of the bondage of certain\nprejudices, certain postulates which cramp and fetter all the men of the\nsame generation? That would mean setting up a wall between themselves\nand others. On the one hand, freedom in the wilderness, on the other,\nmankind. They do not hesitate: they choose mankind, the herd. The herd\nis evil smelling, but it gives warmth. Then those who have chosen\npretend to think what they do not in fact think. It is not very\ndifficult for them: they know so little what they think!... _\"Know\nthyself!\"_... How could they, these men who have hardly a _Me_\nto know? In every collective belief, religious or social, very rare are\nthe men who believe, because very rare are the men who are men. Faith is\nan heroic force: its fire has kindled but a very few human torches, and\neven these have often flickered. The apostles, the prophets, even Jesus\nhave doubted. The rest are only reflections,--save at certain hours when\ntheir souls are dry and a few sparks falling from a great torch set\nlight to all the surface of the plain: then the fire dies down, and\nnothing gleams but the glowing embers beneath the ashes. Not more than a\nfew hundred Christians really believe in Christ. The rest believe that\nthey believe, or else they only try to believe.\n",
                "Many of these revolutionaries were like that. Our friend Canet tried\nhard to believe that he was a revolutionary: he did believe it. And he\nwas scared at his own boldness.\n",
                "All these comfortable people invoked divers principles: some followed\nthe bidding of their hearts, others that of their reason, others again\nonly their interests: some associated their way of thinking with the\nGospel, others with M. Bergson, others, again, with Karl Marx, with\nProudhon, with Joseph de Maistre. with Nietzsche, or with M. Sorel.\nThere were men who were revolutionaries to be in the fashion, some who\nwere so out of snobbishness, and some from shyness: some from hatred,\nothers from love: some from a need of active, hot-headed heroism: and\nsome in sheer slavishness, from the sheeplike quality of their minds.\nBut all, without knowing it, were at the mercy of the wind. All were no\nmore than those whirling clouds of dust which are to be seen like smoke\nin the far distance on the white roads in the country, clouds of dust\nforetelling the coming of the storm.\n",
                "Olivier and Christophe watched the wind coming. Both of them had strong\neyes. But they used them in different ways. Olivier, whose clear gaze,\nin spite of himself, pierced to the very inmost thoughts of men, was\nsaddened by their mediocrity: but he saw the hidden force that sustained\nthem: he was most struck by the tragic aspect of things. Christophe was\nmore sensible of their comic aspect. Men interested him, ideas not at\nall. He affected a contemptuous indifference towards them. He laughed at\nSocialistic Utopias. In a spirit of contradiction and out of instinctive\nreaction against the morbid humanitarianism which was the order of the\nday, he appeared to be more selfish than he was: he was a self-made man,\na sturdy upstart, proud of his strength of body and will, and he was a\nlittle too apt to regard all those who had not his force as shirkers. In\npoverty and alone he had been able to win through: let others do the\nsame! Why all this talk of a social question? What question? Poverty?\n",
                "\"I know all about that,\" he would say. \"My father, my mother, I myself,\nwe have been through it. It's only a matter of getting out of it.\"\n",
                "\"Not everybody can,\" Olivier would reply. \"What about the sick and the\nunlucky?\"\n",
                "\"One must help them, that's all. But that is a very different thing from\nsetting them on a pinnacle, as people are doing nowadays. Only a short\nwhile ago people were asserting the odious doctrine of the rights of the\nstrongest man. Upon my word, I'm inclined to think that the rights of\nthe weakest are even more detestable: they're sapping the thought of\nto-day, the weakest man is tyrannizing over the strong, and exploiting\nthem. It really looks as though it has become a merit to be diseased,\npoor, unintelligent, broken,--and a vice to be strong, upstanding, happy\nin fighting, and an aristocrat in brains and blood. And what is most\nabsurd of all is this, that the strong are the first to believe it....\nIt's a fine subject for a comedy, my dear Olivier!\"\n",
                "\"I'd rather have people laugh at me than make other people weep.\"\n",
                "\"Good boy!\" said Christophe. \"But, good Lord, who ever said anything to\nthe contrary? When I see a hunchback, my back aches for him.... We're\nplaying the comedy, we won't write it.\"\n",
                "He did not suffer himself to be bitten by the prevalent dreams of social\njustice. His vulgar common sense told him and he believed that what had\nbeen would be.\n",
                "\"But if anybody said that to you about art you'd be up in arms against\nhim.\"\n",
                "\"May be. Anyhow, I don't know about anything except art. Nor do you.\nI've no faith in people who talk about things without knowing anything\nabout them.\"\n",
                "Olivier's faith in such people was no greater. Both of them were\ninclined to push their distrust a little too far: they had always held\naloof from politics. Olivier confessed, not without shame, that he could\nnot remember ever having used his rights as an elector: for the last ten\nyears he had not even entered his name at the _mairie_.\n",
                "\"Why,\" he asked, \"should I take part in a comedy which I know to be\nfutile? Vote? For whom should I vote? I don't see any reason for\nchoosing between two candidates, both of whom are unknown to me, while I\nhave only too much reason to expect that, directly the election is over,\nthey will both be false to all their professions of faith. Keep an eye\non them? Remind them of their duty? It would take up the whole of my\nlife, with no result. I have neither time, nor strength, nor the\nrhetorical weapons, nor sufficient lack of scruple, nor is my heart\nsteeled against all the disgust that action brings. Much better to keep\nclear of it all. I am quite ready to submit to the evil. But at least I\nwon't subscribe to it.\"\n",
                "But, in spite of his excessive clear-sightedness, Olivier, to whom the\nordinary routine of politics was repulsive, yet preserved a chimerical\nhope in a revolution. He knew that it was chimerical: but he did not\ndiscard it. It was a sort of racial mysticism in him. Not for nothing\ndoes a man belong to the greatest destructive and constructive people of\nthe Western world, the people who destroy to construct and construct to\ndestroy,--the people who play with ideas and life, and are for ever\nmaking a clean sweep so as to make a new and better beginning, and shed\ntheir blood in pledge.\n",
                "Christophe was endowed with no such hereditary Messianism. He was too\nGerman to relish much the idea of a revolution. He thought that there\nwas no changing the world. Why all these theories, all these words, all\nthis futile uproar?\n",
                "\"I have no need,\" he would say, \"to make a revolution--or long speeches\nabout revolution--in order to prove to my own satisfaction that I am\nstrong. I have no need, like these young men of yours, to overthrow the\nState in order to restore a King or a Committee of Public Safety to\ndefend me. That's a queer way of proving your strength! I can defend\nmyself. I am not an anarchist: I love all necessary order and I revere\nthe laws which govern the universe. But I don't want an intermediary\nbetween them and myself. My will knows how to command, and it knows also\nhow to submit. You've got the classics on the tip of your tongue. Why\ndon't you remember your Corneille: _'Myself alone, and that is\nenough.'_ Your desire for a master is only a cloak for your weakness.\nForce is like the light: only the blind can deny it. Be strong, calmly,\nwithout all your theories, without any act of violence, and then, as\nplants turn to the sun, so the souls of the weak will turn to you.\"\n",
                "But even while he protested that he had no time to waste on political\ndiscussions, he was much less detached from it all than he wished to\nappear. He was suffering, as an artist, from the social unrest. In his\nmomentary dearth of strong passion he would sometimes pause to look\naround and wonder for what people he was writing. Then he would see the\nmelancholy patrons of contemporary art, the weary creatures of the\nupper-classes, the dilettante men and women of the burgess-class, and he\nwould think:\n",
                "\"What profits it to work for such people as these?\" In truth there was\nno lack of men of refinement and culture, men sensitive to skill and\ncraft, men even who were not incapable of appreciating the novelty\nor--(it is all the same)--the archaism of fine feeling. But they were\nbored, too intellectual, not sufficiently alive to believe in the\nreality of art: they were only interested in tricks,--tricks of sound,\nor juggling with ideas; most of them were distraught by other worldly\ninterests, accustomed to scattering their attention over their\nmultifarious occupations, none of which was \"necessary.\" It was almost\nimpossible for them to pierce the outer covering of art, to feel its\nheart deep down: art was not flesh and blood to them; it was literature.\nTheir critics built up their impotence to issue from dilettantism into a\ntheory, an intolerant theory. When it happened that a few here and there\nwere vibrant enough to respond to the voice of art, they were not strong\nenough to bear it, and were left disgruntled and nerve-ridden for life.\nThey were sick men or dead. What could art do in such a hospital?--And\nyet in modern society he was unable to do without these cripples: for\nthey had money, and they ruled the Press: they only could assure an\nartist the means of living. So then he must submit to such humiliation:\nan intimate and sorrowful art, music in which is told the secret of the\nartist's inmost life, offered up as an amusement--or rather as a\npalliative of boredom, or as another sort of boredom--in the theaters or\nin fashionable drawing-rooms, to an audience of snobs and worn-out\nintellectuals.\n",
                "Christophe was seeking the real public, the public which believes in the\nemotions of art as in those of life, and feels them with a virgin soul.\nAnd he was vaguely attracted by the new promised world--the people. The\nmemories of his childhood, Gottfried and the poor, who had revealed to\nhim the living depths of art, or had shared with him the sacred bread of\nmusic, made him inclined to believe that his real friends were to be\nfound among such people. Like many another young man of a generous heart\nand simple faith, he cherished great plans for a popular art, concerts,\nand a theater for the people, which he would have been hard put to it to\ndefine. He thought that a revolution might make it possible to bring\nabout a great artistic renascence, and he pretended that he had no other\ninterest in the social movement. But he was hoodwinking himself: he was\nmuch too alive not to be attracted and drawn onward by the sight of the\nmost living activity of the time.\n",
                "In all that he saw he was least of all interested in the middle-class\ntheorists. The fruit borne by such trees is too often sapless: all the\njuices of life are wasted in ideas. Christophe did not distinguish\nbetween one idea and another. He had no preference even for ideas which\nwere his own when he came upon them congealed in systems. With\ngood-humored contempt he held aloof from the theorists of force as from\nthe theorists of weakness. In every comedy the one ungrateful part is\nthat of the _raisonneur_. The public prefers not only the\nsympathetic characters to him, but the unsympathetic characters also.\nChristophe was like the public in that. The _raisonneurs_ of the\nsocial question seemed tiresome to him. But he amused himself by\nwatching the rest, the simple, the men of conviction, those who believed\nand those who wanted to believe, those who were tricked and those who\nwanted to be tricked, not to mention the buccaneers who plied their\npredatory trade, and the sheep who were made to be fleeced. His sympathy\nwas indulgent towards the pathetically absurd little people like fat\nCanet. Their mediocrity was not offensive to him as it was to Olivier.\nHe watched them all with affectionate and mocking interest: he believed\nthat he was outside the piece they were playing: and he did not see that\nlittle by little he was being drawn into it. He thought only of being a\nspectator watching the wind rush by. But already the wind had caught\nhim, and was dragging him along into its whirling cloud of dust.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "The social drama was twofold. The piece played by the intellectuals was\na comedy within a comedy; the people hardly heeded it. The real drama\nwas that of the people. It was not easy to follow it: the people\nthemselves did not always know where they were in it. It was all\nunexpected, unforeseen.\n",
                "It was not only that there was much more talk in it than action. Every\nFrenchman, be he burgess or of the people, is as great an eater of speeches\nas he is of bread. But all men do not eat the same sort of\nbread. There is the speech of luxury for delicate palates, and the more\nnourishing sort of speech for hungry gullets. If the words are the same,\nthey are not kneaded into the same shape: taste, smell, meaning, all are\ndifferent.\n",
                "The first time Olivier attended a popular meeting and tasted of the fare\nhe lost his appetite: his gorge rose at it, and he could not swallow. He\nwas disgusted by the platitudinous quality of thought, the drab and\nuncouth clumsiness of expression, the vague generalizations, the\nchildish logic, the ill-mixed mayonnaise of abstractions and\ndisconnected facts. The impropriety and looseness of the language were\nnot compensated by the raciness and vigor of the vulgar tongue. The\nwhole thing was compounded of a newspaper vocabulary, stale tags picked\nup from the reach-me-downs of middle-class rhetoric. Olivier was\nparticularly amazed at the lack of simplicity. He forgot that literary\nsimplicity is not natural, but acquired: it is a thing achieved by the\npeople of the elect. Dwellers in towns cannot be simple: they are rather\nalways on the lookout for far-fetched expressions.\n",
                "Olivier did not understand the effect such turgid phrases might have on\ntheir audience. He had not the key to their meaning. We call foreign the\nlanguages of other races, and it never occurs to us that there are\nalmost as many languages in our nation as there are social grades. It is\nonly for a limited few that words retain their traditional and age-old\nmeaning: for the rest they represent nothing more than their own\nexperience and that of the group to which they belong. Many of such\nwords, which are dead for the select few and despised by them, are like\nan empty house, wherein, as soon as the few are gone, new energy and\nquivering passion take up their abode. If you wish to know the master of\nthe house, go into it.\n",
                "That Christophe did.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He had been brought into touch with the working-classes by a neighbor of\nhis who was employed on the State Railways. He was a little man of\nforty-five, prematurely old, with a pathetically bald head, deep-sunken\neyes, hollow cheeks, a prominent nose, fleshy and aquiline, a clever\nmouth, and malformed ears with twisted lobes: the marks of degeneracy.\nHis name was Alcide Gautier. He was not of the people, but of the lower\nmiddle-class.\n",
                "He came of a good family who had spent all they had on the education of\ntheir only son, but, for want of means, had been unable to let him go\nthrough with it. As a very young man he had obtained one of those\nGovernment posts which seem to the lower middle-class a very heaven, and\nare in reality death,--living death.--Once he had gone into it, it had\nbeen impossible for him to escape. He had committed the offense--(for it\nis an offense in modern society)--of marrying for love a pretty\nworkgirl, whose innate vulgarity had only increased with time. She gave\nhim three children and he had to earn a living for them. This man, who\nwas intelligent and longed with all his might to finish his education,\nwas cramped and fettered by poverty. He was conscious of latent powers\nin himself which were stifled by the difficulties of his existence: he\ncould not take any decisive step. He was never alone. He was a\nbookkeeping clerk and had to spend his days over purely mechanical work\nin a room which he had to share with several of his colleagues who were\nvulgar chattering creatures: they were for ever talking of idiotic\nthings and avenged themselves for the absurdity of their existence by\nslandering their chiefs and making fun of him and his intellectual point\nof view which he had not been prudent enough to conceal from them. When\nhe returned home it was to find an evil-smelling charmless room, a noisy\ncommon wife who did not understand him and regarded him as a humbug or a\nfool. His children did not take after him in anything: they took after\ntheir mother. Was it just that it should be so? Was it just? Nothing but\ndisappointment and suffering and perpetual poverty, and work that took\nup his whole day from morning to night, and never the possibility of\nsnatching an hour for recreation, an hour's silence, all this had\nbrought him to a state of exhaustion and nervous\nirritability.--Christophe, who had pursued his acquaintance with him,\nwas struck by the tragedy of his lot: an incomplete nature, lacking\nsufficient culture and artistic taste, yet made for great things and\ncrushed by misfortune. Gautier clung to Christophe as a weak man\ndrowning grasps at the arm of a strong swimmer. He felt a mixture of\nsympathy and envy for Christophe. He took him to popular meetings, and\nshowed him some of the leaders of the syndicalist party to which he\nbelonged for no other reason than his bitterness against society. For he\nwas an aristocrat gone wrong. It hurt him terribly to mix with the\npeople.\n",
                "Christophe was much more democratic than he--the more so as nothing\nforced him to be so--and enjoyed the meetings. The speeches amused him.\nHe did not share Olivier's feeling of repulsion: he was hardly at all\nsensible of the absurdities of the language. In his eyes a windbag was\nas good as any other man. He affected a sort of contempt for eloquence\nin general. But though he took no particular pains to understand their\nrhetoric, he did feel the music which came through the man who was\nspeaking and the men who were listening. The power of the speaker was\nraised to the hundredth degree by the echo thrown back from hie hearers.\nAt first Christophe only took stock of the speakers, and he was\ninterested enough to make the acquaintance of some of them.\n",
                "The man who had the most influence on the crowd was Casimir Joussier,--a\nlittle, pale, dark man, between thirty and thirty-five, with a Mongolian\ncast of countenance, thin, puny, with cold burning eyes, scant hair, and\na pointed beard. His power lay not so much in his gesture, which was\npoor, stilted, and rarely in harmony with the, words,--not so much in\nhis speech, which was raucous and sibilant, with marked pauses for\nbreathing,--as in his personality and the emphatic assurance and force\nof will which emanated from it. He never seemed to admit the possibility\nof any one thinking differently from himself: and as what he thought was\nwhat his audience wanted to think they had no difficulty in\nunderstanding one another. He would go on saying thrice, four times, ten\ntimes, the things they expected him to say: he never stopped hammering\nthe same nail with a tenacious fury: and his audience, following his\nexample, would hammer, hammer, hammer, until the nail was buried deep in\nthe flesh.--Added to this personal ascendancy was the confidence\ninspired by his past life, the _prestige_ of many terms in prison,\nlargely deserved by his violent writings. He breathed out an indomitable\nenergy: but for the seeing eye there was revealed beneath it all an\naccumulated fund of weariness, disgust with so much continual effort,\nanger against fate. He was one of those men who every day spend more\nthan their income of vitality. From his childhood on he had been ground\ndown by work and poverty. He had plied all sorts of trades: journeyman\nglass-blower, plumber, printer: his health was ruined: he was a prey to\nconsumption, which plunged him into fits of bitter discouragement and\ndumb despair of the cause and of himself: at other times it would raise\nhim up to a pitch of excitement. He was a mixture of calculated and\nmorbid violence, of policy and recklessness. He was educated up to a\ncertain point: he had a good knowledge of many things, science,\nsociology, and his various trades: he had a very poor knowledge of many\nothers: and he was just as cocksure with both: he had Utopian notions,\njust ideas, ignorance in many directions, a practical mind, many\nprejudices, experience, and suspicion and hatred of burgess society.\nThat did not prevent his welcoming Christophe. His pride was tickled by\nbeing sought out by a well-known artist. He was of the race of leaders,\nand, whatever he did, he was brusque with ordinary workmen. Although in\nall good faith he desired perfect equality, he found it easier to\nrealize with those above than with those beneath him.\n",
                "Christophe came across other leaders of the working-class movement.\nThere was no great sympathy between them. If the common fight--with\ndifficulty--produced unity of action, it was very far from creating\nunity of feeling. It was easy to see the external and purely transitory\nreality to which the distinction between the classes corresponded. The\nold antagonisms were only postponed and marked: but they continued to\nexist. In the movement were to be found men of the north and men of the\nsouth with their fundamental scorn of each other. The trades were\njealous of each other's wages, and watched each other with an\nundisguised feeling of superiority to all others in each. But the great\ndifference lay--and always will lie--in temperament. Foxes and wolves\nand horned beasts, beasts with sharp teeth, and beasts with four\nstomachs, beasts that are made to eat, and beasts that are made to be\neaten, all sniffed at each other as they passed in the herd that had been\ndrawn together by the accident of class and common interest: and\nthey recognized each other: and they bristled.\n",
                "Christophe sometimes had his meals at a little creamery and restaurant\nkept by a former colleague of Gautier's, one Simon, a railway clerk who\nhad been dismissed for taking part in a strike. The shop was frequented\nby syndicalists. There were five or six of them who used to sit in a\nroom at the back, looking on to an inclosed courtyard, narrow and\nill-lit, from which there arose the never-ceasing desperate song of two\ncaged canaries straining after the light. Joussier used to come with\nhis mistress, the fair Berthe, a large coquettish young woman, with a pale\nface, and a purple cap, and merry, wandering eyes. She had under her\nthumb a good-looking boy, L\u00e9opold Graillot, a journeyman mechanic, who\nwas clever and rather a _poseur_: he was the esthete of the\ncompany. Although he called himself an anarchist, and was one of the\nmost violent opponents of the burgess-class, his soul was typical of\nthat class at its very worst. Every morning for years he had drunk in\nthe erotic and decadent news of the halfpenny literary papers. His\nreading had given him a strongly addled brain. His mental subtlety in\nimagining the pleasures of the senses was allied in him with an absolute\nlack of physical delicacy, indifference to cleanliness, and the\ncomparative coarseness of his life. He had acquired a taste for an\noccasional glass of such adulterated wine--the intellectual alcohol of\nluxury, the unwholesome stimulants of unhealthy rich men. Being unable\nto take these pleasures in the flesh, he inoculated his brain with them.\nThat means a bad tongue in the morning and weakness in the knees. But it\nputs you on an equality with the rich. And you hate them.\n",
                "Christophe could not bear him. He was more in sympathy with Sebastien\nCoquard, an electrician, who, with Joussier, was the speaker with the\ngreatest following. He did not overburden himself with theories. He did\nnot always know where he was going. But he did go straight ahead. He was\nvery French. He was heavily built, about forty, with a big red face, a\nround head, red hair, a flowing beard, a bull neck, and a bellowing\nvoice. Like Joussier, he was an excellent workman, but he loved drinking\nand laughter. The sickly Joussier regarded his superabundant health with\nthe eyes of envy: and, though they were friends, there was always a\nsimmering secret hostility between them.\n",
                "Am\u00e9lie, the manageress of the creamery, a kind creature of forty-five,\nwho must have been pretty once, and still was, in spite of the wear of\ntime, used to sit with them, with some sewing in her hands, listening to\ntheir talk with a jolly smile, moving her lips in time to their words:\nevery now and then she would drop a remark into the discussion, and she\nwould emphasize her words with a nod of her head as she worked. She had\na married daughter and two children of seven and ten--a little girl and\na boy--who used to do their home lessons at the corner of a sticky\ntable, putting out their tongues, and picking up scraps of conversations\nwhich were not meant for their ears.\n",
                "On more than one occasion Olivier tried to go with Christophe. But he\ncould not feel at ease with these people. When these working-men were\nnot tied down by strict factory hours or the insistent scream of a\nhooter, they seemed to have an incredible amount of time to waste,\neither after work, or between jobs, in loafing or idleness. Christophe,\nbeing in one of those periods when the mind has completed one piece of\nwork and is waiting until a new piece of work presents itself, was in no\ngreater hurry than they were: and he liked sitting there with his elbows\non the table, smoking, drinking, and talking. But Olivier's respectable\nburgess instincts were shocked, and so were his traditional habits of\nmental discipline, and regular work, and scrupulous economy of time: and\nhe did not relish such a waste of so many precious hours. Besides that,\nhe was not good at talking or drinking. Above all there was his physical\ndistaste for it all, the secret antipathy which raises a physical\nbarrier between the different types of men, the hostility of the senses,\nwhich stands in the way of the communion of their souls, the revolt of\nthe flesh against the heart. When Olivier was alone with Christophe he\nwould talk most feelingly about the duty of fraternizing with the\npeople: but when he found himself face to face with the people, he was\nimpotent to do anything, in spite of his good will. Christophe, on the\nother hand, who laughed at his ideas, could, without the least effort,\nmeet any workman he chanced to come across in brotherhood. It really\nhurt Olivier to find himself so cut off from these men. He tried to be\nlike them, to think like them, to speak like them. He could not do it.\nHis voice was dull, husky, had not the ring that was in theirs. When he\ntried to catch some of their expressions the words would stick in his\nthroat or sound queer and strange. He watched himself; he was\nembarrassed, and embarrassed them. He knew it. He knew that to them he\nwas a stranger and suspect, that none of them was in sympathy with him,\nand then, when he was gone, everybody would sigh with relief: \"Ouf!\" As\nhe passed among them he would notice hard, icy glances, such hostile\nglances as the working-classes, embittered by poverty, cast at any\ncomfortable burgess. Perhaps Christophe came in for some of it too: but\nhe never noticed it.\n",
                "Of all the people in that place the only ones who showed any inclination\nto be friendly with Olivier were Am\u00e9lie's children. They were much more\nattracted by their superior in station than disposed to hate him. The\nlittle boy was fascinated by the burgess mode of thought: he was clever\nenough to love it, though not clever enough to understand it: the little\ngirl, who was very pretty, had once been taken by Olivier to see Madame\nArnaud, and she was hypnotized by the comfort and ease of it all: she\nwas silently delighted to sit in the fine armchairs, and to feel the\nbeautiful clothes, and to be with lovely ladies: like the little\nsimpleton she was, she longed to escape from the people and soar upwards\nto the paradise of riches and solid comfort. Olivier had no desire or\ntaste for the cultivation of these inclinations in her: and the simple\nhomage she paid to his class by no means consoled him for the silent\nantipathy of her companions. Their ill-disposition towards him pained\nhim. He had such a burning desire to understand them! And in truth he\ndid understand them, too well, perhaps: he watched them too closely, and\nhe irritated them. It was not that he was indiscreet in his curiosity,\nbut that he brought to bear on it his habit of analyzing the souls of\nmen and his need of love.\n",
                "It was not long before he perceived the secret drama of Joussier's life:\nthe disease which was undermining his constitution, and the cruelty of\nhis mistress. She loved him, she was proud of him: but she had too much\nvitality: he knew that she was slipping away from him, would slip away\nfrom him: and he was aflame with jealousy. She found his jealousy\ndiverting: she was for ever exciting the men about her, bombarding them\nwith her eyes, flinging around them her sensual provocative atmosphere:\nshe loved to play with him like a cat. Perhaps she deceived him with\nGraillot. Perhaps it pleased her to let him think so. In any case if she\nwere not actually doing so, she very probably would. Joussier dared not\nforbid her to love whomsoever she pleased: did he not profess the woman's\nright to liberty equally with the man's? She reminded him of\nthat slyly and insolently one day when he was upbraiding her. He was\ndelivered up to a terrible struggle within himself between his theories\nof liberty and his violent instincts. At heart he was still a man like\nthe men of old, despotic and jealous: by reason he was a man of the\nfuture, a Utopian. She was neither more nor less than the woman of\nyesterday, to-morrow, and all time.--And Olivier, looking on at their\nsecret duel, the savagery of which was known to him by his own\nexperience, was full of pity for Joussier when he realized his weakness.\nBut Joussier guessed that Olivier was reading him: and he was very far\nfrom liking him for it.\n",
                "There was another interested witness, an indulgent spectator of this\ngame of love and hate. This was the manageress, Am\u00e9lie. She saw\neverything without seeming to do so. She knew life. She was an honest,\nhealthy, tranquil, easy-going woman, and in her youth had been free\nenough. She had been in a florist's shop: she had had a lover of the\nclass above her own: she had had other lovers. Then she had married a\nworking-man. She had become a good wife and mother. But she understood\neverything, all the foolish ways of the heart, Joussier's jealousy, as\nwell as the young woman's desire for amusement. She tried to help them\nto understand each other with a few affectionate words:\n",
                "\"You must make allowances: it is not worth while creating bad blood\nbetween you for such a trifle....\"\n",
                "She was not at all surprised when her words produced no result....\n",
                "\"That's the way of the world. We must always be torturing ourselves....\"\n",
                "She had that splendid carelessness of the people, from which misfortune\nof every sort seems harmlessly to glide. She had had her share of\nunhappiness. Three months ago she had lost a boy of fifteen whom she\ndearly loved: it had been a great grief to her: but now she was once\nmore busy and laughing. She used to say:\n",
                "\"If one were to think of these things one could not live.\"\n",
                "So she ceased to think of it. It was not selfishness. She could not do\notherwise: her vitality was too strong: she was absorbed by the present:\nit was impossible for her to linger over the past. She adapted herself\nto things as they were, and would adapt herself to whatever happened. If\nthe revolution were to come and turn everything topsy-turvy she would\nsoon manage to be standing firmly on her feet, and do everything that\nwas there to do; she would be in her place wherever she might be set\ndown. At heart she had only a modified belief in the revolution. She had\nhardly any real faith in anything whatever. It is hardly necessary to\nadd that she used to consult the cards in her moments of perplexity, and\nthat she never failed to make the sign of the cross when she met a\nfuneral. She was very open-minded and very tolerant, and she had the\nskepticism of the people of Paris, that healthy skepticism which doubts,\nas a man breathes, joyously. Though she was the wife of a revolutionary,\nnevertheless she took up a motherly and ironical attitude towards her\nhusband's ideas and those of his party--and those of the other\nparties,--the sort of attitude she had towards the follies of youth--and\nof maturity. She was never much moved by anything. But she was\ninterested in everything. And she was equally prepared for good and bad\nluck. In fine, she was an optimist.\n",
                "\"It's no good getting angry.... Everything settles itself so long as\nyour health is good....\"\n",
                "That was clearly to Christophe's way of thinking. They did not need much\nconversation to discover that they belonged to the same family. Every\nnow and then they would exchange a good-humored smile, while the others\nwere haranguing and shouting. But, more often, she would laugh to\nherself as she looked at Christophe, and saw him being caught up by the\nargument to which he would at once bring more passion than all the rest\nput together.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Christophe did not observe Olivier's isolation and embarrassment. He\nmade no attempt to probe down to the inner workings of his companions.\nBut he used to eat and drink with them, and laugh and lose his temper.\nThey were never distrustful of him, although they used to argue heatedly\nenough. He did not mince his words with them. At bottom he would have\nfound it very hard to say whether he was with or against them. He never\nstopped to think about it. No doubt if the choice had been forced upon\nhim he would have been a syndicalist as against Socialism and all the\ndoctrines of the State--that monstrous entity, that factory of\nofficials, human machines. His reason approved of the mighty effort of\nthe cooperative groups, the two-edged ax of which strikes at the same\ntime at the dead abstractions of the socialistic State, and at the\nsterility of individualism, that corrosion of energy, that dispersion of\ncollective force in individual frailties,--the great source of modern\nwretchedness for which the French Revolution is in part responsible.\n",
                "But Nature is stronger than reason. When Christophe came in touch with\nthe syndicates--those formidable coalitions of the weak--his vigorous\nindividuality drew back. He could not help despising those men who\nneeded to be linked together before they could march on--to the fight;\nand if he admitted that it was right for them to submit to such a law,\nhe declared that such a law was not for him. Besides, if the weak and\nthe oppressed are sympathetic, they cease altogether to be so when they\nin their turn become oppressors. Christophe, who had only recently been\nshouting out to the honest men living in isolation: \"Unite! Unite!\" had\na most unpleasant sensation when for the first time he found himself in\nthe midst of such unions of honest men, all mixed up with other men who\nwere less honest, and yet were endowed with their force, their rights,\nand only too ready to abuse them. The best people, those whom Christophe\nloved, the friends whom he had met in The House, on every floor, drew no\nsort of profit from these fighting combinations. They were too sensitive\nat heart and too timid not to be scared: they were fated to be the first\nto be crushed out of existence by them. Face to face with the\nworking-class movement they were in the same position as Olivier and the\nmost warmly generous of the young men of the middle-class. Their\nsympathies were with the workers organizing themselves. But they had\nbeen brought up in the cult of liberty: now liberty was exactly what the\nrevolutionaries cared for least of all. Besides, who is there nowadays\nthat cares for liberty? A select few who have no sort of influence over\nthe world. Liberty is passing through dark days. The Popes of Rome\nproscribe the light of reason. The Popes of Paris put out the light of\nthe heavens. And M. Pataud puts out the lights of the streets.\nEverywhere imperialism is triumphant: the theocratic imperialism of the\nChurch of Rome: the military imperialism of the mercantile and mystic\nmonarchies: the bureaucratic imperialism of the republics of Freemasonry\nand covetousness: the dictatorial imperialism of the revolutionary\ncommittees. Poor liberty, thou art not in this world!... The abuse of\npower preached and practised by the revolutionaries revolted Christophe\nand Olivier. They had little regard for the blacklegs who refuse to\nsuffer for the common cause. But it seemed abominable to them that the\nothers should claim the right to use force against them.--And yet it is\nnecessary to take sides. Nowadays the choice in fact lies not between\nimperialism and liberty, but between one imperialism and another.\nOlivier said:\n",
                "\"Neither. I am for the oppressed.\"\n",
                "Christophe hated the tyranny of the oppressors no less. But he was\ndragged into the wake of force in the track of the army of the\nworking-classes in revolt.\n",
                "He was hardly aware that it was so. He would tell his companions in the\nrestaurant that he was not with them.\n",
                "\"As long as you are only out for material interests,\" he would say, \"you\ndon't interest me. The day when you march out for a belief then I shall\nbe with you. Otherwise, what have I to do with the conflict between one\nman's belly and another's? I am an artist; it is my duty to defend art;\nI have no right to enroll myself in the service of a party. I am\nperfectly aware that recently certain ambitious writers, impelled by a\ndesire for an unwholesome popularity, have set a bad example. It seems\nto me that they have not rendered any great service to the cause which\nthey defended in that way: but they have certainly betrayed art. It is\nour, the artists', business to save the light of the intellect. We have\nno right to obscure it with your blind struggles. Who shall hold the\nlight aloft if we let it fall? You will be glad enough to find it still\nintact after the battle. There must always be workers busy keeping up\nthe fire in the engine, while there is fighting on the deck of the ship.\nTo understand everything is to hate nothing. The artist is the compass\nwhich, through the raging of the storm, points steadily to the north.\"\n",
                "They regarded him as a maker of phrases, and said that, if he were\ntalking of compasses, it was very clear that he had lost his: and they\ngave themselves the pleasure of indulging in a little friendly contempt\nat his expense. In their eyes an artist was a shirker who contrived to\nwork as little and as agreeably as possible.\n",
                "He replied that he worked as hard as they did, harder even, and that he\nwas not nearly so afraid of work. Nothing disgusted him so much as\n_sabotage_, the deliberate bungling of work, and skulking raised to\nthe level of a principle.\n",
                "\"All these wretched people,\" he would say, \"afraid for their own\nskins!... Good Lord! I've never stopped working since I was eight. You\npeople don't love your work; at heart you're just common men.... If only\nyou were capable of destroying the Old World! But you can't do it. You\ndon't even want to. No, you don't even want to. It is all very well for\nyou to go about shrieking menace and pretending you're going to\nexterminate the human race. You have only one thought: to get the upper\nhand and lie snugly in the warm beds of the middle-classes. Except for a\nfew hundred poor devils, navvies, who are always ready to break their\nbones or other people's bones for no particular reason,--just for\nfun--or for the pain, the age-old pain with which they are simply\nbursting, the whole lot of you think of nothing but deserting the camp\nand going over to the ranks of the middle-classes on the first\nopportunity. You become Socialists, journalists, lecturers, men of\nletters, deputies, Ministers.... Bah! Bah! Don't you go howling about\nso-and-so! You're no better. You say he is a traitor?... Good. Whose\nturn next? You'll all come to it. There is not one of you who can resist\nthe bait. How could you? There is not one of you who believes in the\nimmortality of the soul. You are just so many bellies, I tell you. Empty\nbellies thinking of nothing but being filled.\"\n",
                "Thereupon they would all lose their tempers and all talk at once. And in\nthe heat of the argument it would often happen that Christophe, whirled\naway by his passion, would become more revolutionary than the others. In\nvain did he fight against it: his intellectual pride, his complacent\nconception of a purely esthetic world, made for the joy of the spirit,\nwould sink deep into the ground at the sight of injustice. Esthetic, a\nworld in which eight men out of ten live in nakedness and want, in\nphysical and moral wretchedness? Oh! come! A man must be an impudent\ncreature of privilege who would dare to claim as much. An artist like\nChristophe, in his inmost conscience, could not but be on the side of\nthe working-classes. What man more than the spiritual worker has to\nsuffer from the immorality of social conditions, from the scandalously\nunequal partition of wealth among men? The artist dies of hunger or\nbecomes a millionaire for no other reason than the caprice of fashion\nand of those who speculate on fashion. A society which suffers its best\nmen to die or gives them extravagant rewards is a monstrous society: it\nmust be swept and put in order. Every man, whether he works or no, has a\nright to a living minimum.\n",
                "Every kind of work, good or mediocre, should be rewarded, not according\nto its real value--(who can be the infallible judge of that?)--but\naccording to the normal legitimate needs of the worker. Society can and\nshould assure the artist, the scientist, and the inventor an income\nsufficient to guarantee that they have the means and the time yet\nfurther to grace and honor it. Nothing more. The _Gioconda_ is not\nworth a million. There is no relation between a sum of money and a work\nof art: a work of art is neither above nor below money: it is outside\nit. It is not a question of payment: it is a question of allowing the\nartist to live. Give him enough to feed him, and allow him to work in\npeace. It is absurd and horrible to try to make him a robber of\nanother's property. This thing must be put bluntly: every man who has\nmore than is necessary for his livelihood and that of his family, and\nfor the normal development of his intelligence, is a thief and a robber.\nIf he has too much, it means that others have too little. How often have\nwe smiled sadly to hear tell of the inexhaustible wealth of France, and\nthe number of great fortunes, we workers, and toilers, and\nintellectuals, and men and women who from our very birth have been given\nup to the wearying task of keeping ourselves from dying of hunger, often\nstruggling in vain, often seeing the very best of us succumbing to the\npain of it all,--we who are the moral and intellectual treasure of the\nnation! You who have more than your share of the wealth of the world are\nrich at the cost of our suffering and our poverty. That troubles you not\nat all: you have sophistries and to spare to reassure you: the sacred\nrights of property, the fair struggle for life, the supreme interests of\nthat Moloch, the State and Progress, that fabulous monster, that\nproblematical Better to which men sacrifice the Good,--the Good of other\nmen.--But for all that, the fact remains, and all your sophistries will\nnever manage to deny it: \"You have too much to live on. We have not\nenough. And we are as good as you. And some of us are better than the\nwhole lot of you put together.\"\n",

                "So Christophe was affected by the intoxication of the passions with\nwhich he was surrounded. Then he was astonished at his own bursts of\neloquence. But he did not attach any importance to them. He was amused\nby such easily roused excitement, which he attributed to the bottle. His\nonly regret was that the wine was not better, and he would belaud the\nwines of the Rhine. He still thought that he was detached from\nrevolutionary ideas. But there arose the singular phenomenon that\nChristophe brought into the discussion, if not the upholding of them, a\nsteadily increasing passion, while that of his companions seemed in\ncomparison to diminish.\n",
                "As a matter of fact, they had fewer illusions than he. Even the most\nviolent leaders, the men who were most feared by the middle-classes,\nwere at heart uncertain and horribly middle-class. Coquard, with his\nlaugh like a stallion's neigh, shouted at the top of his voice and made\nterrifying gestures: but he only half believed what he was saying: it\nwas all for the pleasure of talking, giving orders, being active: he was\na braggart of violence. He knew the cowardice of the middle-classes\nthrough and through, and he loved terrorizing them by showing that he\nwas stronger than they: he was quite ready to admit as much to\nChristophe, and to laugh over it. Graillot criticized everything, and\neverything anybody tried to do: he made every plan come to nothing.\nJoussier was for ever affirming, for he was unwilling ever to be in the\nwrong. He would be perfectly aware of the inherent weakness of his line\nof argument, but that would make him only the more obstinate in sticking\nto it: he would have sacrificed the victory of his cause to his pride of\nprinciple. But he would rush from extremes of bullet-headed faith to\nextremes of ironical pessimism, when he would bitterly condemn the lie\nof all systems of ideas and the futility of all efforts.\n",
                "The majority of the working-classes were just the same. They would\nsuddenly relapse from the intoxication of words into the depths of\ndiscouragement. They had immense illusions: but they were based upon\nnothing: they had not won them in pain or forged them for themselves:\nthey had received them ready-made, by that law of the smallest effort\nwhich led them for their amusements to the slaughter-house and the\nblatant show. They suffered from an incurable indolence of mind for\nwhich there were only too many excuses: they were like weary beasts\nasking only to be suffered to lie down and in peace to ruminate over\ntheir end and their dreams. But once they had slept off their dreams\nthere was nothing left but an even greater weariness and the doleful\ndumps. They were for ever flaring up to a new leader: and very soon they\nbecame suspicious of him and spurned him. The sad part of it all was\nthat they were never wrong: one after another their leaders were dazzled\nby the bait of wealth, success, or vanity: for one Joussier, who was\nkept from temptation by the consumption under which he was wasting away,\na brave crumbling to death, how many leaders were there who betrayed the\npeople or grew weary of the fight! They were victims of the secret sore\nwhich was devouring the politicians of every party in those days:\ndemoralization through women and money, women and money,--(the two\nscourges are one and the same).--In the Government as in the ministry\nthere were men of first-rate talent, men who had in them the stuff of\nwhich great statesmen are made--(they, might have been great statesmen\nin the days of Richelieu, perhaps);--but they lacked faith and\ncharacter: the need, the habit, the weariness of pleasure, had sapped\nthem: when they were engaged upon vast schemes they fumbled into\nincoherent action, or they would suddenly fling up the whole thing,\nwhile important business was in progress, desert their country or their\ncause for rest and pleasure. They were brave enough to meet death in\nbattle: but very few of the leaders were capable of dying in harness, at\ntheir posts, never budging, with their hands upon the rudder and their\neyes unswervingly fixed upon the invisible goal.\n",
                "The revolution was hamstrung by the consciousness of the fundamental\nweakness. The leaders of the working-classes spent part of their time in\nblaming each other. Their strikes always failed as a result of the\nperpetual dissensions between the leaders and the trades-unions, between\nthe reformers and the revolutionaries--and of the profound timidity\nthat underlay their blustering threats--and of the inherited\nsheepishness that made the rebels creep once more beneath the yoke upon\nthe first legal sentence,--and of the cowardly egoism and the baseness\nof those who profited by the revolt of others to creep a little nearer\nthe masters, to curry favor and win a rich reward for their\ndisinterested devotion. Not to speak of the disorder inherent in all\ncrowds, the anarchy of the people. They tried hard to create corporate\nstrikes which should assume a revolutionary character: but they were not\nwilling to be treated as revolutionaries. They had no liking for\nbayonets. They fancied that it was possible to make an omelette without\neggs. In any case, they preferred the eggs to be broken by other people.\n",
                "Olivier watched, observed, and was not surprised. From the very outset\nhe had recognized the great inferiority of these men to the work which\nthey were supposed to be accomplishing: but he had also recognized the\ninevitable force that swept them on: and he saw that Christophe, unknown\nto himself, was being carried on by the stream. But the current would\nhave nothing to do with himself, who would have asked nothing better\nthan to let himself be carried away.\n",
                "It was a strong current: it was sweeping along an enormous mass of\npassions, interest, and faith, all jostling, pushing, merging into each\nother, boiling and frothing and eddying this way and that. The leaders\nwere in the van; they were the least free of all, for they were pushed\nforward, and perhaps they had the least faith of all: there had been a\ntime when they believed: they were like the priests against whom they\nhad so loudly railed, imprisoned by their vows, by the faith they once\nhad had, and were forced to profess to the bitter end. Behind them the\ncommon herd was brutal, vacillating, and short-sighted. The great\nmajority had a sort of random faith, because the current had now set in\nthe direction of Utopia: but a little while, and they would cease to\nbelieve because the current had changed. Many believed from a need of\naction, a desire for adventure, from romantic folly. Others believed\nfrom a sort of impertinent logic, which was stripped of all common\nsense. Some believed from goodness of heart. The self-seeking only made\nuse of ideas as weapons for the fight: their eye was for the main\nchance: they were fighting for a definite sum as wages for a definite\nnumber of hours' work. The worst of all were nursing a secret hope of\nwreaking a brutal revenge for the wretched lives they had led.\n",
                "But the current which bore them all along was wiser than they: it knew\nwhere it was going. What did it matter that at any moment it might dash\nup against the dyke of the Old World! Olivier foresaw that a social\nrevolution in these days would be squashed. But he knew also that\nrevolution would achieve its end through defeat as well as through\nvictory: for the oppressors only accede to the demands of the oppressed\nwhen the oppressed inspire them with fear. And so the violence of the\nrevolutionaries was of no less service to their cause than the justice\nof that cause. Both violence and justice were part and parcel of the\nplan of that blind and certain force which moves the herd of human\nkind....\n",
                "_\"For consider what you are, you whom the Master has summoned. If the\nbody be considered there are not many among you who are wise, or strong,\nor noble. But He has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound\nthe wise; and He has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the\nstrong: and He has chosen the vile things of the world and the despised\nthings, and the things that are not, to the destruction of those things\nthat are....\"_\n",
                "And yet, whatever may be the Master who orders all things,--(Reason or\nUnreason),--and although the social organization prepared by syndicalism\nmight constitute a certain comparative stage in progress for the future,\nOlivier did not think it worth while for Christophe and himself to\nscatter the whole of their power of illusion and sacrifice in this\nearthy combat which would open no new world. His mystic hopes of the\nrevolution were dashed to the ground. The people seemed to him no better\nand hardly any more sincere than the other classes: there was not enough\ndifference between them and others. In the midst of the torrent of\ninterests and muddy passions, Olivier's gaze and heart were attracted by\nthe little islands of independent spirits, the little groups of true\nbelievers who emerged here and there like flowers on the face of the\nwaters. In vain do the elect seek to mingle with the mob: the elect\nalways come together,--the elect of all classes and all parties,--the\nbearers of the fire of the world. And it is their sacred duty to see to\nit that the fire in their hands shall never die down.\n",
                "Olivier had already made his choice.\n",
                "A few houses away from that in which he lived was a cobbler's booth,\nstanding a little below the level of the street,--a few planks nailed\ntogether, with dirty windows and panes of paper. It was entered by three\nsteps down, and you had to stoop to stand up in it. There was just room\nfor a shelf of old shoes, and two stools. All day long, in accordance\nwith the classic tradition of cobbling, the master of the place could be\nheard singing. He used to whistle, drum on the soles of the boots, and\nin a husky voice roar out coarse ditties and revolutionary songs, or\nchaff the women of the neighborhood as they passed by. A magpie with a\nbroken wing, which was always hopping about on the pavement, used to\ncome from a porter's lodge and pay him a visit. It would stand on the\nfirst step at the entrance to the booth and look at the cobbler. He\nwould stop for a moment to crack a dirty joke with the bird in a piping\nvoice, or he would insist on whistling the _Internationale_. The\nbird would stand with its beak in the air, listening gravely: every now\nand then it would bob with its beak down by way of salutation, and it\nwould awkwardly flap its wings in order to regain its balance: then it\nwould suddenly turn round, leaving the cobbler in the middle of a\nsentence, and fly away with its wing and a bit on to the back of a\nbench, from whence it would hurl defiance at the dogs of the quarter.\nThen the cobbler would return to his leather, and the flight of his\nauditor would by no means restrain him from going through with his\nharangue.\n",
                "He was fifty-six, with a jovial wayward manner, little merry eyes under\nenormous eyebrows, with a bald top to his head rising like an egg out of\nthe nest of his hair, hairy ears, a black gap-toothed mouth that gaped\nlike a well when he roared with laughter, a very thick dirty beard, at\nwhich he used to pluck in handfuls with his long nails that were always\nfilthy with wax. He was known in the district as Daddy Feuillet, or\nFeuillette, or Daddy la Feuillette--and to tease him they used to call\nhim La Fayette: for politically the old fellow was one of the reds: as a\nyoung man he had been mixed up in the Commune, sentenced to death, and\nfinally deported: he was proud of his memories, and was always\nrancorously inclined to lump together Badinguet, Galliffet, and\nFoutriquet. He was a regular attendant at the revolutionary meetings,\nand an ardent admirer of Coquard and the vengeful idea that he was\nalways prophesying with much beard-wagging and a voice of thunder. He\nnever missed one of his speeches, drank in his words, laughed at his\njokes with head thrown back and gaping mouth, foamed at his invective,\nand rejoiced in the fight and the promised paradise. Next day, in his\nbooth, he would read over the newspaper report of the speeches: he would\nread them aloud to himself and his apprentice: and to taste their full\nsweetness he would have them read aloud to him, and used to box his\napprentice's ears if he skipped a line. As a consequence he was not\nalways very punctual in the delivery of his work when he had promised\nit: on the other hand, his work was always sound: it might wear out the\nuser's feet, but there was no wearing out his leather....\n",
                "The old fellow had in his shop a grandson of thirteen, a hunchback, a\nsickly, rickety boy, who used to run his errands, and was a sort of\napprentice. The boy's mother had left her family when she was seventeen\nto elope with a worthless fellow who had sunk into hooliganism, and\nbefore very long had been caught, sentenced, and so disappeared from the\nscene. She was left alone with the child, deserted by her family, and\ndevoted herself to the upbringing of the boy Emmanuel. She had\ntransferred to him all the love and hatred she had had for her lover.\nShe was a woman of a violent and jealous character, morbid to a degree.\nShe loved her child to distraction, brutally ill-treated him, and, when\nhe was ill, was crazed with despair. When she was in a bad temper she\nwould send him to bed without any dinner, without so much as a piece of\nbread. When she was dragging him along through the streets, if he grew\ntired and would not go on and slipped down to the ground, she would kick\nhim on to his feet again. She was amazingly incoherent in her use of\nwords, and she used to pass swiftly from tears to a hysterical mood of\ngaiety. She died. The cobbler took the boy, who was then six years old.\nHe loved him dearly: but he had his own way of showing it, which\nconsisted in bullying the boy, battering him with a large assortment of\ninsulting names, pulling his ears, and clouting him over the head\nfrom morning to night by way of teaching him his job: and at the same time\nhe grounded him thoroughly in his own social and anti-clerical catechism.\n",
                "Emmanuel knew that his grandfather was not a bad man: but he was always\nprepared to raise his arm to ward off his blows: the old fellow used to\nfrighten him, especially on the evenings when he got drunk. For Daddy la\nFeuillette had not come by his nickname for nothing: he used to get\ntipsy twice or thrice a month: then he used to talk all over the place,\nand laugh, and act the swell, and always in the end he used to give the\nboy a good thrashing. His bark was worse than his bite. But the boy\nwas terrified: his ill-health made him more sensitive than other children:\nhe was precociously intelligent, and he had inherited a fierce and\nunbalanced capacity for feeling from his mother. He was overwhelmed by\nhis grandfather's brutality, and also by his revolutionary\nharangues,--(for the two things went together: it was particularly when\nthe old man was drunk that he was inclined to hold forth).--His whole\nbeing quivered in response to outside impressions, just as the booth\nshook with the passing of the heavy omnibuses. In his crazy imagination\nthere were mingled, like the humming vibrations of a belfry, his\nday-to-day sensations, the wretchedness of his childhood, his deplorable\nmemories of premature experience, stories of the Commune, scraps of\nevening lectures and newspaper feuilletons, speeches at meetings, and\nthe vague, uneasy, and violent sexual instincts which his parents had\ntransmitted to him. All these things together formed a monstrous grim\ndream-world, from the dense night, the chaos and miasma of which there\ndarted dazzling rays of hope.\n",
                "The cobbler used sometimes to drag his apprentice with him to Am\u00e9lie's\nrestaurant. There it was that Olivier noticed the little hunchback with\nthe voice of a lark. Sitting and never talking to the workpeople, he had\nhad plenty of time to study the boy's sickly face, with its jutting brow\nand shy, humiliated expression: he had heard the coarse jokes that had\nbeen thrown at the boy, jokes which were met with silence and a faint\nshuddering tremor. During certain revolutionary utterances he had seen\nthe boy's soft brown eyes light up with the chimerical ecstasy of the\nfuture happiness,--a happiness which, even if he were ever to realize\nit, would make but small difference in his stunted life. At such moments\nhis expression would illuminate his ugly face in such a way as to make\nits ugliness forgotten. Even the fair Berthe was struck by it; one day\nshe told him of it, and, without a word of warning, kissed him on the\nlips. The boy started back: he went pale and shuddering, and flung away\nin disgust. The young woman had no time to notice him: she was already\nquarreling with Joussier. Only Olivier observed Emmanuel's uneasiness:\nhe followed the boy with his eyes, and saw him withdraw into the shadow\nwith his hands trembling, head down, looking down at the floor, and\ndarting glances of desire and irritation at the girl. Olivier went up to\nhim, spoke to him gently and politely and soothed him.... Who can tell\nall that gentleness can bring to a heart deprived of all consideration?\nIt is like a drop of water falling upon parched earth, greedily to be\nsucked up. It needed only a few words, a smile, for the boy Emmanuel in\nhis heart of hearts to surrender to Olivier, and to determine to have\nOlivier for his friend. Thereafter, when he met him in the street and\ndiscovered that they were neighbors, it seemed to him to be a mysterious\nsign from Fate that he had not been mistaken. He used to watch for\nOlivier to pass the booth, and say good-day to him: and if ever Olivier\nwere thinking of other things and did not glance in his direction, then\nEmmanuel would be hurt and sore.\n",
                "It was a great day for him when Olivier came into Daddy Feuillette's\nshop to leave an order. When the work was done Emmanuel took it to\nOlivier's rooms; he had watched for him to come home so as to be sure of\nfinding him in. Olivier was lost in thought, hardly noticed him, paid\nthe bill, and said nothing: the boy seemed to wait, looked from right to\nleft, and began reluctantly to move away. Olivier, in his kindness,\nguessed what was happening inside the boy: he smiled and tried to talk\nto him in spite of the awkwardness he always felt in talking to any of\nthe people. But now he was able to find words simple and direct. An\nintuitive perception of suffering made him see in the boy--(rather too\nsimply)--a little bird wounded by life, like himself, seeking\nconsolation with his head under his wing, sadly huddled up on his perch,\ndreaming of wild flights into the light. A feeling that was something\nakin to instinctive confidence brought the boy closer to him: he felt\nthe attraction of the silent soul, which made no moan and used no harsh\nwords, a soul wherein he could take shelter from the brutality of the\nstreets; and the room, thronged with books, filled with bookcases\nwherein there slumbered the dreams of the ages, filled him with an\nalmost religious awe. He made no attempt to evade Olivier's questions:\nhe replied readily, with sudden gasps and starts of shyness and pride:\nbut he had no power of expression. Carefully, patiently, Olivier\nunswathed his obscure stammering soul: little by little he was able to\nread his hopes and his absurdly touching faith in the new birth of the\nworld. He had no desire to laugh, though he knew that the dream was\nimpossible, and would never change human nature. The Christians also\nhave dreamed of impossible things, and they have not changed human\nnature. From the time of Pericles to the time of M. Falli\u00e8res when has\nthere been any moral progress?... But all faith is beautiful: and when\nthe light of an old faith dies down it is meet to salute the kindling of\nthe new: there will never be too many. With a curious tenderness Olivier\nsaw the uncertain light gleaming in the boy's mind. What a strange mind\nit was!... Olivier was not altogether able to follow the movement of his\nthoughts, which were incapable of any sustained effort of reason,\nprogressing in hops and jerks, and lagging behind in conversation,\nunable to follow, clutching in some strange way at an image called up by\na word spoken some time before, then suddenly catching up, rushing\nahead, weaving a commonplace thought or an ordinary cautious phrase into\nan enchanted world, a crazy and heroic creed. The boy's soul, slumbering\nand waking by fits and starts, had a puerile and mighty need of\noptimism: to every idea in art or science thrown out to it, it would add\nsome complacently melodramatic tag, which would link it up with and\nsatisfy its own chimerical dreams.\n",
                "As an experiment Olivier tried reading aloud to the boy on Sundays. He\nthought that he was most likely to be interested by realistic and\nfamiliar stories: he read him Tolstoy's _Memories of Childhood_.\nThey made no impression on the boy: he said:\n",
                "\"That's quite all right. Things are like that. One knows that.\"\n",
                "And he could not understand why anybody should take so much trouble to\nwrite about real things....\n",
                "\"He's just a boy,\" he would say disdainfully, \"just an ordinary little\nboy.\"\n",
                "He was no more responsive to the interest of history: and science bored\nhim: it was to him no more than a tiresome introduction to a fairy-tale:\nthe invisible forces brought into the service of man were like terrible\ngenii laid low. What was the use of so much explanation? When a man\nfinds something it is no good his telling how he found it, he need\nonly tell what it is that he has found. The analysis of thought is a luxury\nof the upper-classes. The souls of the people demand synthesis, ideas\nready-made, well or ill, or rather ill-made than well, but all tending\nto action, and composed of the gross realities of life, and charged with\nelectricity. Of all the literature open to Emmanuel that which most\nnearly touched him was the epic pathos of certain passages in Hugo and\nthe fuliginous rhetoric of the revolutionary orators, whom he did not\nrightly understand, characters who no more understood themselves than\nHugo did. To him as to them the world was not an incoherent collection\nof reasons or facts, but an infinite space, steeped in darkness and\nquivering with light, while through the night there passed the beating\nof mighty wings all bathed in the sunlight. Olivier tried in vain to\nmake him grasp his cultivated logic. The boy's rebellious and weary soul\nslipped through his fingers: and it sank back with a sigh of comfort and\nrelief into the indeterminate haze and the chafing of its own sensation\nand hallucinations, like a woman in love giving herself with eyes closed\nto her lover.\n",
                "Olivier was at once attracted and disconcerted by the qualities in the\nchild so much akin to his own:--loneliness, proud weakness, idealistic\nardor,--and so very different,--the unbalanced mind, the blind and\nunbridled desires, the savage sensuality which had no idea of good and\nevil, as they are defined in ordinary morality. He had only a partial\nglimpse of that sensuality which would have terrified him had he known\nits full extent. He never dreamed of the existence of the world of\nuneasy passions stirring and seething in the heart and mind of his\nlittle friend. Our bourgeois atavism has given us too much wisdom. We\ndare not even look within ourselves. If we were to tell a hundredth part\nof the dreams that come to an ordinary honest man, or of the desires\nwhich come into being in the body of a chaste woman, there would be a\nscandal and an outcry. Silence such monsters! Bolt and bar their cage!\nBut let us admit that they exist, and that in the souls of the young\nthey are insecurely fettered.--The boy had all the erotic desires and\ndreams which we agree among ourselves to regard as perverse: they would\nsuddenly rise up unawares and take him by the throat: they would come in\ngusts and squalls: and they only gained in intensity and heat through\nthe irritation set up by the isolation to which his ugliness condemned\nhim. Olivier knew nothing of all this. Emmanuel was ashamed in his\npresence. He felt the contagion of such peace and purity. The example of\nsuch a life was a taming influence upon him. The boy felt a passionate\nlove for Olivier. And his suppressed passions rushed headlong into\ntumultuous dreams of human happiness, social brotherhood, fantastic\naviation, wild barbaric poetry--a whole heroic, erotic, childish,\nsplendid, vulgar world in which his intelligence and his will were\ntossed hither and thither in mental loafing and fever.\n",
                "He did not have much time for indulging himself in this way, especially\nin his grandfather's booth, for the old man was never silent for a\nminute on end, but was always whistling, hammering, and talking from\nmorning to night; but there is always room for dreams. How many voyages\nof the mind one can make standing up with wide-open eyes in the space of\na second!--Manual labor is fairly well suited to intermittent thought.\nThe working-man's mind would be hard put to it without an effort of the\nwill to follow a closely reasoned chain of argument: if he does manage\nto do so he is always certain to miss a link here and there: but in the\nintervals of rhythmic movement ideas crop up and mental images come\nfloating to the surface: the regular movements of the body send them\nflying upwards like sparks under the smith's bellows. The thought of the\npeople! It is just smoke and fire, a shower of glittering sparks fading\naway, glowing, then fading away once more! But sometimes a spark will be\ncarried away by the wind to set fire to the dried forests and the fat\nricks of the upper-classes....\n",
                "Olivier procured Emmanuel a place in a printing house. It was the boy's\nwish, and his grandfather did not oppose it; he was glad to see his\ngrandson better educated than himself, and he had a great respect for\nprinter's ink. In his new trade the boy found his work more exhausting\nthan in the old: but he felt more free to think among the throng of\nworkers than in the little shop where he used to sit alone with his\ngrandfather.\n",
                "The best time of day was the dinner hour. He would escape and get right\naway from the horde of artisans crowding round the little tables on the\npavement and into the wineshops of the district, and limp along to the\nsquare hard by: and there he would sit astride a bench under a spreading\nchestnut-tree, near a bronze dancing faun with grapes in his hands, and\nuntie his brown-paper parcel of bread and meat, and munch it slowly,\nsurrounded by a little crowd of sparrows. Over the green turf little\nfountains spread the trickling web of their soft rain. Round-eyed,\nslate-blue pigeons cooed in a sunlit tree. And all about him was the\nperpetual hum of Paris, the roar of the carriages, the surging sea of\nfootsteps, the familiar street-cries, the gay distant whistle of a\nchina-mender, a navvy's hammer ringing out on the cobblestones, the\nnoble music of a fountain--all the fevered golden trappings of the\nParisian dream.--And the little hunchback, sitting astride his bench,\nwith his mouth full, never troubling to swallow, would drowse off into a\ndelicious torpor, in which he lost all consciousness of his twisted\nspine and his craven soul, and was all steeped in an indeterminate\nintoxicating happiness.\n",
                "\"... Soft warm light, sun of justice that art to shine for us to-morrow,\nart thou not shining now? It is all so good, so beautiful! We are rich,\nwe are strong, we are hale, we love ... I love, I love all men, all men\nlove me.... Ah! How splendid it all is! How splendid it will be\nto-morrow!...\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "The factory hooters would sound: the boy would come to his senses,\nswallow down his mouthful, take a long drink at the Wallace fountain\nnear by, slip back into his hunchbacked shell, and go limping and\nhobbling back to his place in the printing works in front of the cases\nof magic letters which would one day write the _Mene, Mene, Tekel,\nUpharsin_, of the Revolution.\n",
                "Daddy Feuillet had a crony, Trouillot, the stationer on the other side\nof the street. He kept a stationery and haberdashery shop, in the\nwindows of which were displayed pink and green bonbons in green bottles,\nand pasteboard dolls without arms or legs. Prom either side of the\nstreet, one standing on his doorstep, the other in his shop, the two old\nmen used to exchange winks and nods and a whole elaborate code of\npantomimic gesture. At intervals, when the cobbler was tired of\nhammering, and had, as he used to say, the cramp in his buttocks, they\nwould hail each other, La Feuillette in his shrill treble, Trouillot\nwith a muffled roar, like a husky calf; and they would go off together\nand take a nip at a neighboring bar. They were never in any hurry to\nreturn. They were both infernally loquacious. They had known each other\nfor half a century. The stationer also had played a little walking-on\npart in the great melodrama of 1871. To see the fat placid creature with\nhis black cap on his head and his white blouse, and his gray,\nheavy-dragoon mustache, and his dull light-blue bloodshot eyes with\nheavy pouches under the lids, and his flabby shining cheeks, always in a\nperspiration, slow-footed, gouty, out of breath, heavy of speech, no one\nwould ever have thought it. But he had lost none of the illusions of the\nold days. He had spent some years as a refugee in Switzerland, where he\nhad met comrades of all nations, notably many Russians, who had\ninitiated him in the beauties of anarchic brotherhood. On that point he\ndisagreed with La Feuillette, who was a proper Frenchman, an adherent of\nthe strong line and of absolutism in freedom. For the rest, they were\nequally firm in their belief in the social revolution and the\nworking-class _salente_ of the future. Each was devoted to a leader\nin whose person he saw incarnate the ideal man that each would have\nliked to be. Trouillot was for Joussier, La Feuillette for Coquard. They\nused to engage in interminable arguments about the points on which they\nwere divided, being quite confident that the thoughts upon which they\nagreed were definitely decided;--(and they were so sure of their common\nground that they were never very far from believing, in their cups, that\nit was a matter of hard fact).--The cobbler was the more argumentative\nof the two. He believed as a matter of reason: or at least he flattered\nhimself that he did, for, Heaven knows, his reason was of a very\npeculiar kind, and could have fitted the foot of no other man. However,\nthough he was less skilled in argument than in cobbling, he was always\ninsisting that other minds should be shod to his own measure. The\nstationer was more indolent and less combative, and never worried about\nproving his faith. A man only tries to prove what he doubts himself. He\nhad no doubt. His unfailing optimism always made him see things as he\nwanted to see them, and not see things or forget them immediately when\nthey were otherwise. Whether he did so wilfully or from apathy he saved\nhimself from trouble of any sort: experience to the contrary slipped off\nhis hide without leaving a mark.--The two of them were romantic babies\nwith no sense of reality, and the revolution, the mere sound of the name\nof which was enough to make them drunk, was only a jolly story they told\nthemselves, and never knew whether it would ever happen, or whether it\nhad actually happened. And the two of them firmly believed in the God of\nHumanity merely by the transposition of the habits they had inherited\nfrom their forbears, who for centuries had bowed before the Son of\nMan.--It goes without saying that both men were anti-clerical.\n",
                "The amusing part of it was that the honest stationer lived with a very\npious niece who did just what she liked with him. She was a very dark\nlittle woman, plump, with sharp eyes and a gift of volubility spiced\nwith a strong Marseilles accent, and she was the widow of a clerk in the\nDepartment of Commerce. When she was left alone with no money, with a\nlittle girl, and received a home with her uncle, the common little\ncreature gave herself airs, and was more than a little inclined to think\nthat she was doing her shop-keeping relation a great favor by serving in\nhis shop: she reigned there with the airs of a fallen queen, though,\nfortunately for her uncle's business and his customers, her arrogance\nwas tempered by her natural exuberance and her need of talking. As\nbefitted a person of her distinction, Madame Alexandrine was royalist\nand clerical, and she used to parade her feelings with a zeal that was\nall the more indiscreet as she took a malicious delight in teasing the\nold miscreant in whose house she had taken up her abode. She had set\nherself up as mistress of the house, and regarded herself as responsible\nfor the conscience of the whole household: if she was unable to convert\nher uncle--(she had vowed to capture him _in extremis_),--she\nbusied herself to her heart's content with sprinkling the devil with\nholy water. She fixed pictures of Our Lady of Lourdes and Saint Anthony\nof Padua on the walls: she decorated the mantelpiece with little painted\nimages in glass cases: and in the proper season she made a little chapel\nof the months of Mary with little blue candles in her daughter's\nbedroom. It was impossible to tell which was the predominant factor in\nher aggressive piety, real affection for the uncle she desired to\nconvert or a wicked joy in worrying the old man.\n",
                "He put up with it apathetically and sleepily: he preferred not to run\nthe risk of rousing the tempestuous ire of his terrible niece: it was\nimpossible to fight against such a wagging tongue: he desired peace\nabove all things. Only once did he lose his temper, and that was when a\nlittle Saint Joseph made a surreptitious attempt to creep into his room\nand take up his stand above his bed: on this point he gained the day:\nfor he came very near to having an apoplectic fit, and his niece was\nfrightened: she did not try the experiment again. For the rest he gave\nin, and pretended not to see: the odor of sanctity made him feel very\nuncomfortable: but he tried not to think of it. On the other hand they\nwere at one in pampering the girl, little Reine, or Rainette.\n",
                "She was twelve or thirteen, and was always ill. For some months past she\nhad been on her back with hip disease, with the whole of one side of her\nbody done up in plaster of Paris like a little Daphne in her shell. She\nhad eyes like a hurt dog's, and her skin was pallid and pale like a\nplant grown out of the sun: her head was too big for her body, and her\nfair hair, which was very soft and very tightly drawn back, made it\nappear even bigger: but she had an expressive and sweet face, a sharp\nlittle nose, and a childlike expression. The mother's piety had assumed\nin the child, in her sickness and lack of interest, a fervid character.\nShe used to spend hours in telling her beads, a string of corals,\nblessed by the Pope: and she would break off in her prayers to kiss it\npassionately. She did next to nothing all day long: needlework made her\ntired: Madame Alexandrine had not given her a taste for it. She did\nlittle more than read a few insipid tracts, or a stupid miraculous\nstory, the pretentious and bald style of which seemed to her the very\nflower of poetry,--or the criminal reports illustrated in color in the\nSunday papers which her stupid mother used to give her. She would\nperhaps do a little crochet-work, moving her lips, and paying less\nattention to her needle than to the conversation she would hold with\nsome favorite saint or even with God Himself. For it is useless to\npretend that it is necessary to be Joan of Are to have such visitations:\nevery one of us has had them. Only, as a rule, our celestial visitors\nleave the talking to us as we sit by the fireside: and they say never a\nword. Rainette never dreamed of taking exception to it: silence gives\nconsent. Besides, she had so much to tell them that she hardly gave them\ntime to reply: she used to answer for them. She was a silent chatterer:\nshe had inherited her mother's volubility: but her fluency was drawn off\nin inward speeches like a stream disappearing underground.--Of course\nshe was a party to the conspiracy against her uncle with the object of\nprocuring his conversion: she rejoiced over every inch of the house\nwrested by the spirit of light from the spirit of darkness: and on more\nthan one occasion she had sewn a holy medallion on to the inside of the\nlining of the old man's coat or had slipped into one of his pockets the\nbead of a rosary, which her uncle, in order to please her, had pretended\nnot to notice.--This seizure by the two pious women of the bitter foe of\nthe priests was a source of indignation and joy to the cobbler. He had\nan inexhaustible store of coarse pleasantries on the subject of women\nwho wear breeches: and he used to jeer at his friend for letting himself\nbe under their thumb. As a matter of fact he had no right to scoff: for\nhe had himself been afflicted for twenty years with a shrewish\ncross-grained wife, who had always regarded him as an old scamp and had\ntaken him down a peg or two. But he was always careful not to mention\nher. The stationer was a little ashamed, and used to defend himself\nfeebly, and in a mealy voice profess a Kropotkinesque gospel of\ntolerance.\n",
                "Rainette and Emmanuel were friends. They had seen each other every day\never since they were children. To be quite accurate, Emmanuel only\nrarely ventured to enter the house. Madame Alexandrine used to regard\nhim with an unfavorable eye as the grandson of an unbeliever and a\nhorrid little dwarf. But Rainette used to spend the day on a sofa near\nthe window on the ground floor. Emmanuel used to tap at the window as he\npassed, and, flattening his nose against the panes, he would make a face\nby way of greeting. In summer, when the window was left open, he would\nstop and lean his arms on the windowsill, which was a little high for\nhim;--(he fancied that this attitude was flattering to himself and that,\nhis shoulders being shrugged up in such a pose of intimacy, it might\nserve to disguise his actual deformity);--and they would talk. Rainette\ndid not have too many visitors, and she never noticed that Emmanuel was\nhunchbacked. Emmanuel, who was afraid and mortified in the presence of\ngirls, made an exception in favor of Rainette. The little invalid, who\nwas half petrified, was to him something intangible and far removed,\nsomething almost outside existence. Only on the evening when the fair\nBerthe kissed him on the lips, and the next day too, he avoided Rainette\nwith an instinctive feeling of repulsion: he passed the house without\nstopping and hung his head: and he prowled about far away, fearfully and\nsuspiciously, like a pariah dog. Then he returned. There was so little\nwoman in her! As he was passing on his way home from the works, trying\nto make himself as small as possible among the bookbinders in their long\nworking-blouses like nightgowns--busy merry young women whose hungry\neyes stripped him as he passed,--how eagerly he would scamper away to\nRainette's window! He was grateful for his little friend's infirmity:\nwith her he could give himself airs of superiority and even be a little\npatronizing. With a little swagger he would tell her about the things\nthat happened in the street and always put himself in the foreground.\nSometimes in gallant mood he would bring Rainette a little present,\nroast chestnuts in winter, a handful of cherries in summer. And she used\nto give him some of the multi-colored sweets that filled the two glass\njars in the shop-window: and they would pore over picture postcards\ntogether. Those were happy moments: they could both forget the pitiful\nbodies in which their childish souls were held captive.\n",
                "But sometimes they would begin to talk, like their elders, of politics\nand religion. Then they would become as stupid as their elders. It put\nan end to their sympathy and understanding. She would talk of miracles\nand the nine days' devotion, or of pious images tricked out with paper\nlace, and of days of indulgence. He used to tell her that it was all\nfolly and mummery, as he had heard his grandfather say. But when he in\nturn tried to tell her about the public meetings to which the old man\nhad taken him, and the speeches he had heard, she would stop him\ncontemptuously and tell him that all such folk were drunken sots.\nBitterness would creep into their talk. They would get talking about\ntheir relations: they would recount the insulting things that her mother\nand his grandfather had said of each other respectively. Then they would\ntalk about themselves. They tried to say disagreeable things to each\nother. They managed that without much difficulty. They indulged in\ncoarse gibes. But she was always the more malicious of the two. Then he\nwould go away: and when he returned he would tell her that he had been\nwith other girls, and how pretty they were, and how they had joked and\nlaughed, and how they were going to meet again next Sunday. She would\nsay nothing to that: she used to pretend to despise what he said: and\nthen, suddenly, she would grow angry, and throw her crochet-work at his\nhead, and shout at him to go, and declare that she loathed him: and she\nwould hide her face in her hands. He would leave her on that, not at all\nproud of his victory. He longed to pull her thin little hands away from\nher face and to tell her that it was not true. But his pride would not\nsuffer him to return.\n",
                "One day Rainette had her revenge.--He was with some of the other boys at\nthe works. They did not like him because he used to hold as much aloof\nfrom them as possible and never spoke, or talked too well, in a na\u00efvely\npretentious way, like a book, or rather like a newspaper article--(he\nwas stuffed with newspaper articles).--That day they had begun to talk\nof the revolution and the days to come. He waxed enthusiastic and made a\nfool of himself. One of his comrades brought him up sharp with these\nbrutal words:\n",
                "\"To begin with, you won't be wanted, you're too ugly. In the society of\nthe future, there won't be any hunchbacks. They'll be drowned at birth.\"\n",
                "That brought him toppling down from his lofty eloquence. He stopped\nshort, dumfounded. The others roared with laughter. All that afternoon\nhe went about with clenched teeth. In the evening he was going home,\nhurrying back to hide away in a corner alone with his suffering. Olivier\nmet him: he was struck by his downcast expression: he guessed that he\nwas suffering.\n",
                "\"You are hurt. Why?\"\n",
                "Emmanuel refused to answer. Olivier pressed him kindly. The boy\npersisted in his silence: but his jaw trembled as though he were on the\npoint of weeping. Olivier took his arm and led him back to his rooms.\nAlthough he too had the cruel and instinctive feeling of repulsion from\nugliness and disease that is in all who are not born with the souls of\nsisters of charity, he did not let it appear.\n",
                "\"Some one has hurt you?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "\"What did they do?\"\n",
                "The boy laid bare his heart. He said that he was ugly. He said that his\ncomrades had told him that their revolution was not for him.\n",
                "\"It is not for them, either, my boy, nor for us. It is not a single\nday's affair. It is all for those who will come after us.\"\n",
                "The boy was taken aback by the thought that it would be so long\ndeferred.\n",
                "\"Don't you like to think that people are working to give happiness to\nthousands of boys like yourself, to millions of human beings?\"\n",
                "Emmanuel sighed and said:\n",
                "\"But it would be good to have a little happiness oneself.\"\n",
                "\"My dear boy, you mustn't be ungrateful. You live in the most beautiful\ncity, in an age that is most rich in marvels; you are not a fool, and\nyou have eyes to see. Think of all the things there are to be seen and\nloved all around you.\"\n",
                "He pointed out a few things.\n",
                "The boy listened, nodded his head, and said:\n",
                "\"Yes, but I've got to face the fact that I shall always have to live in\nthis body of mine!\"\n",
                "\"Not at all. You will quit it.\"\n",
                "\"And that will be the end.\"\n",
                "\"How do you know that?\"\n",
                "The boy was aghast. Materialism was part and parcel of his grandfather's\ncreed: he thought that it was only the priest-ridden prigs who believed\nin an eternal life. He knew that his friend was not such a one: and he\nwondered if Olivier could be speaking seriously. But Olivier held his\nhand and expounded at length his idealistic faith, and the unity of\nboundless life, that has neither beginning nor end, in which all the\nmillions of creatures and all the million million moments of time are\nbut rays of the sun, the sole source of it all. But he did not put it to\nhim in such an abstract form. Instinctively, when he talked to the boy,\nhe adapted himself to his mode of thought;--ancient legends, the\nmaterial and profound fancies of old cosmogonies were called to mind:\nhalf in fun, half in earnest, he spoke of metempsychosis and the\nsuccession of countless forms through which the soul passes and flows,\nlike a spring passing from pool to pool. All this was interspersed with\nreminiscences of Christianity and images taken from the summer evening,\nthe light of which was cast upon them both. He was sitting by the open\nwindow, and the boy was standing by his side, and their hands were\nclasped. It was a Saturday evening. The bells were ringing. The earliest\nswallows, only just returned, were skimming the walls of the houses. The\ndim sky was smiling above the city, which was wrapped in shadow. The boy\nheld his breath and listened to the fairy-tale his man friend was\ntelling him. And Olivier, warmed by the eagerness of his young hearer,\nwas caught up by the interest of his own stories.\n",
                "There are decisive moments in life when, just as the electric lights\nsuddenly flash out in the darkness of a great city, so the eternal fires\nflare up in the darkness of the soul. A spark darting from another soul\nis enough to transmit the Promethean fire to the waiting soul. On that\nspring evening Olivier's calm words kindled the light that never dies in\nthe mind hidden in the boy's deformed body, as in a battered lantern. He\nunderstood none of Olivier's arguments: he hardly heard them. But the\nlegends and images which were only beautiful stories and parables to\nOlivier, took living shape and form in his mind, and were most real. The\nfairy-tale lived, moved, and breathed all around him. And the view\nframed in the window of the room, the people passing in the street, rich\nand poor, the swallows skimming the walls, the jaded horses dragging\ntheir loads along, the stones of the houses drinking in the cool shadow\nof the twilight, and the pale heavens where the light was dying--all the\noutside world was softly imprinted on his mind, softly as a kiss. It was\nbut the flash of a moment. Then the light died down. He thought of\nRainette, and said;\n",
                "\"But the people who go to Mass, the people who believe in God, are all\ncracked, aren't they?\"\n",
                "Olivier smiled.\n",
                "\"They believe,\" he said, \"as we do. We all believe the same thing. Only\ntheir belief is less than ours. They are people who have to shut all the\nshutters and light the lamp before they can see the light. They see God\nin the shape of a man. We have keener eyes. But the light that we love\nis the same.\"\n",
                "The boy went home through the dark streets in which the gas-lamps were\nnot yet lit. Olivier's words were ringing in his head. He thought that\nit was as cruel to laugh at people because they had weak eyes as because\nthey were hunchbacked. And he thought that Rainette had very pretty\neyes: and he thought that he had brought tears into them. He could not\nbear that. He turned and went across to the stationer's. The window was\nstill a little open: and he thrust his head inside and called in a\nwhisper:\n",
                "\"Rainette.\"\n",
                "She did not reply.\n",
                "\"Rainette. I beg your pardon.\"\n",
                "From the darkness came Rainette's voice, saying:\n",
                "\"Beast! I hate you.\"\n",
                "\"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n",
                "He stopped. Then, on a sudden impulse, he said in an even softer\nwhisper, uneasily, rather shamefacedly:\n",
                "\"You know, Rainette, I believe in God just as you do.\"\n",
                "\"Really?\"\n",
                "\"Really.\"\n",
                "He said it only out of generosity. But, as soon as he had said it, he\nbegan to believe it.\n",
                "They stayed still and did not speak. They could not see each other.\nOutside the night was so fair, so sweet!... The little cripple murmured:\n",
                "\"How good it will be when one is dead!\"\n",
                "He could hear Rainette's soft breathing.\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"Good-night, little one.\"\n",
                "Tenderly came Rainette's voice:\n",
                "\"Good-night.\"\n",
                "He went away comforted. He was glad that Rainette had forgiven him. And,\nin his inmost soul, the little sufferer was not sorry to think that he\nhad been the cause of suffering to the girl.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Olivier had gone into retirement once more. It was not long before\nChristophe rejoined him. It was very certain that their place was not\nwith the syndicalist movement: Olivier could not throw in his lot with\nsuch people. And Christophe would not. Olivier flung away from them in\nthe name of the weak and the oppressed; Christophe in the name of the\nstrong and the independent. But though they had withdrawn, one to the\nbows, the other to the stern, they were still traveling in the vessel\nwhich was carrying the army of the working-classes and the whole of\nsociety. Free and self-confident, Christophe watched with tingling\ninterest the coalition of the proletarians: he needed every now and then\nto plunge into the vat of the people: it relaxed him: he always issued\nfrom it fresher and jollier. He kept up his relation with Coquard, and\nhe went on taking his meals from time to time at Am\u00e9lie's. When he was\nthere he lost all self-control, and would whole-heartedly indulge his\nfantastic humor: he was not afraid of paradox: and he took a malicious\ndelight in pushing his companions to the extreme consequences of their\nabsurd and wild principles. They never knew whether he was speaking in\njest or in earnest: for he always grew warm as he talked, and always in\nthe end lost sight of the paradoxical point of view with which he had\nbegun. The artist in him was carried away by the intoxication of the rest.\nIn one such moment of esthetic emotion in Am\u00e9lie's back-shop, he\nimprovised a revolutionary song, which was at once tried, repeated, and\non the very next day spread to every group of the working-classes. He\ncompromised himself. He was marked by the police. Manousse, who was in\ntouch with the innermost chambers of authority, was warned by one of his\nfriends, Xavier Bernard, a young official in the police department, who\ndabbled in literature and expressed a violent admiration for\nChristophe's music:--(for dilettantism and the spirit of anarchy had\nspread even to the watchdogs of the Third Republic).\n",
                "\"That Krafft of yours is making himself a nuisance,\" said Bernard to\nManousse. \"He's playing the braggart. We know what it means: but I tell\nyou that those in high places would be not at all sorry to catch a\nforeigner--what's more, a German--in a revolutionary plot: it is the\nregular method of discrediting the party and casting suspicion upon its\ndoings. If the idiot doesn't look out we shall be obliged to arrest him.\nIt's a bore. You'd better warn him.\"\n",
                "Manousse did warn Christophe: Olivier begged him to be careful.\nChristophe did not take their advice seriously.\n",
                "\"Bah!\" he said. \"Everybody knows there's no harm in me. I've a perfect\nright to amuse myself. I like these people. They work as I do, and they\nhave faith, and so have I. As a matter of fact, it isn't the same faith;\nwe don't belong to the same camp.... Very well! We'll fight. Not that I\ndon't like fighting. What would you? I can't do as you do, and stay\ncurled up in my shell. I must breathe. I'm stifled by the comfortable\nclasses.\"\n",
                "Olivier, whose lungs were not so exacting, was quite at his ease in his\nsmall rooms with the tranquil society of his two women friends, though\none of them, Madame Arnaud, had flung herself into charitable work, and\nthe other, C\u00e9cile, was entirely taken up with looking after the baby, to\nsuch an extent that she could talk of nothing else and to nobody else,\nin that twittering, beatific tone which is an attempt to emulate the\nnote of a little bird, and to mold its formless song into human speech.\n",
                "His excursion into working-class circles had left him with two\nacquaintances. Two men of independent views, like himself. One of them,\nGu\u00e9rin, was an upholsterer. He worked when he felt so disposed,\ncapriciously, though he was very skilful. He loved his trade. He had a\nnatural taste for artistic things, and had developed it by observation,\nwork, and visits to museums. Olivier had commissioned him to repair an\nold piece of furniture: it was a difficult job, and the upholsterer had\ndone it with great skill: he had taken a lot of time and trouble over\nit: he sent in a very modest bill to Olivier because he was so delighted\nwith his success. Olivier became interested in him, questioned him about\nhis life, and tried to find out what he thought of the working-class\nmovement. Gu\u00e9rin had no thought about it: he never worried about it. At\nbottom he did not belong to the working-class, or to any class. He read\nvery little. All his intellectual development had come about through his\nsenses, eyes, hands, and the taste innate in the true Parisian. He was a\nhappy man. The type is by no means rare among the working people of the\nlower middle-class, who are one of the most intelligent classes in the\nnation: for they realize a fine balance between manual labor and healthy\nmental activity.\n",
                "Olivier's other acquaintance was a man of a more original kind. He was a\npostman, named Hurteloup. He was a tall, handsome creature, with bright\neyes, a little fair beard and mustache, and an open, merry expression.\nOne day he came with a registered letter, and walked into Olivier's\nroom. While Olivier was signing the receipt, he wandered round, looking\nat the books, with his nose thrust close up to their backs:\n",
                "\"Ha! Ha!\" he said. \"You have the classics....\"\n",
                "He added:\n",
                "\"I collect books on history. Especially books about Burgundy.\"\n",
                "\"You are a Burgundian?\" asked Olivier.\n",
                "  _\"Bourguignon sal\u00e9,\n  L'\u00e9p\u00e9e au c\u00f4t\u00e9,\n  La barbe au menton,\n  Sante Bourguignon,\"_\n",
                "replied the postman with a laugh. \"I come from the Avallon country. I\nhave family papers going back to 1200 and something....\"\n",
                "Olivier was intrigued, and tried to find out more about him. Hurteloup\nasked nothing better than to be allowed to talk. He belonged, in fact,\nto one of the oldest families in Burgundy. One of his ancestors had been\non crusade with Philippe Auguste: another had been secretary of State\nunder Henri II. The family had begun to decay in the seventeenth\ncentury. At the time of the Revolution, ruined and despairing, they had\ntaken the plunge into the ocean of the people. Now they were coming to\nthe surface again as the result of honest work and the physical and\nmoral vigor of Hurteloup the postman, and his fidelity to his race. His\ngreatest hobby had been collecting historical and genealogical documents\nrelating to his family and their native country. In off hours he used to\ngo to the Archives and copy out old papers. Whenever he did not\nunderstand them he would go and ask one of the people on his beat, a\nChartist or a student at the Sorbonne, to explain. His illustrious\nancestry did not turn his head: he would speak of it laughingly, with\nnever a shade of embarrassment or of indignation at the hardness of\nfate. His careless sturdy gaiety was a delightful thing to see. And when\nOlivier looked at him he thought of the mysterious ebb and flow of the\nlife of human families, which for centuries flows burningly, for\ncenturies disappears under the ground, and then comes bubbling forth\nagain, having gathered fresh energy from the depths of the earth. And\nthe people seemed to him to be an immense reservoir into which the\nrivers of the past plunge, while the rivers of the future spring forth\nagain, and, though they bear a new name, are sometimes the same as those\nof old.\n",
                "He was in sympathy with both Gu\u00e9rin and Hurteloup: but it is obvious\nthat they could not be company for him: between him and them there was\nno great possibility of conversation. The boy Emmanuel took up more of\nhis time: he came now almost every evening. Since their magical talk\ntogether a revolution had taken place in the boy. He had plunged into\nreading with a fierce desire for knowledge. He would come back from his\nbooks bewildered and stupefied. Sometimes he seemed even less\nintelligent than before: he would hardly speak: Olivier could only get\nhim to answer in monosyllables: the boy would make fatuous replies to\nhis questions. Olivier would lose heart: he would try not to let it be\nseen: but he thought he had made a mistake, and that the boy was\nthoroughly stupid. He could not see the frightful fevered travail in\nincubation that was going on in the inner depths of the boy's soul.\nBesides, he was a bad teacher, and was more fitted to sow the good seed\nat random in the fields than to weed the soil and plow the furrows.\nChristophe's presence only served to increase the difficulty. Olivier\nfelt a certain awkwardness in showing his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to his friend:\nhe was ashamed of Emmanuel's stupidity, which was raised to alarming\nproportions when Jean-Christophe was in the room. Then the boy would\nwithdraw into bashful sullenness. He hated Christophe because Olivier\nloved him: he could not bear any one else to have a place in his\nmaster's heart. Neither Christophe nor Olivier had any idea of the love\nand jealousy tugging at the boy's heart. And yet Christophe had been\nthrough it himself in old days. But he was unable to see himself in the\nboy who was fashioned of such different metal from that of which he\nhimself was made. In the strange obscure combination of inherited\ntaints, everything, love, hate, and latent genius, gave out an entirely\ndifferent sound.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "The First of May was approaching. A sinister rumor ran through Paris.\nThe blustering leaders of the C.G.T. were doing their best to spread it.\nTheir papers were announcing the coming of the great day, mobilizing the\nforces of the working-classes, and directing the word of terror upon the\npoint in which the comfortable classes were mostly sensitive--namely,\nupon the stomach.... _Feri ventrem_.... They were threatening them\nwith a general strike. The scared Parisians were leaving for the country\nor laying in provisions as against a siege. Christophe had met Canet, in\nhis motor, carrying two hams and a sack of potatoes: he was beside\nhimself: he did not in the least know to which party he belonged: he was\nin turn an old Republican, a royalist, and a revolutionary. His cult of\nviolence was like a compass gone wrong, with the needle darting from\nnorth to south and from south to north. In public he still played the\npart of chorus to the wild speeches of his friends: but he would have\ntaken _in petto_ the first dictator who came along and swept away\nthe red spectre.\n",
                "Christophe was tickled to death by such universal cowardice. He was\nconvinced that nothing would come of it all. Olivier was not so sure.\nHis birth into the burgess-class had given him something of the\ninevitable and everlasting tremulation which the comfortable classes\nalways feel upon the recollection or the expectation of Revolution.\n",
                "\"That's all right!\" said Christophe. \"You can sleep in peace. Your\nRevolution isn't going to happen to-morrow. You're all afraid. Afraid of\nbeing hurt. That sort of fear is everywhere. In the upper-classes, in\nthe people, in every nation, in all the nations of the West. There's not\nenough blood in the whole lot of them: they're afraid of spilling a\nlittle. For the last forty years all the fighting has been done in words,\nin newspaper articles. Just look at your old Dreyfus Affair. You\nshouted loud enough: 'Death! Blood! Slaughter!'... Oh! you Gascons!\nSpittle and ink! But how many drops of blood?\"\n",
                "\"Don't you be so sure,\" said Olivier. \"The fear of blood is a secret\ninstinctive feeling that on the first shedding of it the beast in man\nwill see red, and the brute will appear again under the crust of\ncivilization: and God knows how it will ever be muzzled! Everybody\nhesitates to declare war: but when the war does come it will be a\nfrightful thing.\"\n",
                "Christophe shrugged his shoulders and said that it was not for nothing\nthat the heroes of the age were lying heroes, Cyrano the braggart and\nthe swaggering cock, Chantecler.\n",
                "Olivier nodded. He knew that in France bragging is the beginning of\naction. However, he had no more faith than Christophe in an immediate\nmovement: it had been too loudly proclaimed, and the Government was on\nits guard. There was reason to believe that the syndicalist strategists\nwould postpone the fight for a more favorable opportunity.\n",
                "During the latter half of April Olivier had an attack of influenza: he\nused to get it every winter about the same time, and it always used to\ndevelop into his old enemy, bronchitis. Christophe stayed with him for a\nfew days. The attack was only a slight one, and soon passed. But, as\nusual, it left Olivier morally and physically worn out, and he was in\nthis condition for some time after the fever had subsided. He stayed in\nbed, lying still for hours without any desire to get up or even to move:\nhe lay there watching Christophe, who was sitting at his desk, working,\nwith his back towards him.\n",
                "Christophe was absorbed in his work. Sometimes, when he was tired of\nwriting, he would suddenly get up and walk over to the piano: he would\nplay, not what he had written, but just whatever came into his mind.\nThen there came to pass a very strange thing. While the music he had\nwritten was conceived in a style which recalled that of his earlier\nwork, what he played was like that of another man. It was music of a\nworld raucous and uncontrolled. There were in it a disorder and a\nviolence, and incoherence which had no resemblance at all to the\npowerful order and logic which were everywhere present in his other\nmusic. These unconsidered improvizations, escaping the scrutiny of his\nartistic conscience, sprang, like the cry of an animal, from the flesh\nrather than from the mind; and seemed to reveal a disturbance of the\nbalance of his soul, a storm brewing in the depths of the future.\nChristophe was quite unconscious of it: but Olivier would listen, look\nat Christophe, and feel vaguely uneasy. In his weak condition he had a\nsingular power of penetration, a far-seeing eye: he saw things that no\nother man could perceive.\n",
                "Christophe thumped out a final chord and stopped all in a sweat, and\nlooking rather haggard: he looked at Olivier, and there was still a\ntroubled expression in his eyes; then he began to laugh, and went back\nto his desk. Olivier asked him:\n",
                "\"What was that, Christophe?\"\n",
                "\"Nothing,\" replied Christophe. \"I'm stirring the water to attract my\nfish.\"\n",
                "\"Are you going to write that?\"\n",
                "\"That? What do you mean?\"\n",
                "\"What you've just said.\"\n",
                "\"What did I say? I don't remember.\"\n\"What were you thinking of?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know,\" said Christophe, drawing his hand across his forehead.\n",
                "He went on writing. Silence once mere filled the room. Olivier went on\nlooking at Christophe. Christophe felt that he was looking, and turned.\nOlivier's eyes were upon him with such a hunger of affection!\n",
                "\"Lazy brute!\" he said gaily.\n",
                "Olivier sighed.\n",
                "\"What's the matter?\" asked Christophe.\n",
                "\"Oh! Christophe! To think there are so many things in you, sitting\nthere, close at hand, treasures that you will give to others, and I\nshall never be able to share!...\"\n",
                "\"Are you mad? What's come to you?\"\n",
                "\"I wonder what your life will be. I wonder what peril and sorrow you\nhave still to go through.... I would like to follow you. I would like to\nbe with you.... But I shan't see anything of it all. I shall be left\nstuck stupidly by the wayside.\"\n",
                "\"Stupid? You are that. Do you think that I would leave you behind even\nif you wanted to be left?\"\n",
                "\"You will forget me,\" said Olivier.\n",
                "Christophe got up and went and sat on the bed by Olivier's side: he took\nhis wrists, which were wet with a clammy sweat of weakness. His\nnightshirt was open at the neck, showing his weak chest, his too\ntransparent skin, which was stretched and thin like a sail blown out by\na puff of wind to rending point. Christophe's strong fingers fumbled as\nhe buttoned the neckband of Olivier's nightshirt. Olivier suffered him.\n",
                "\"Dear Christophe!\" he said tenderly. \"Yet I have had one great happiness\nin my life!\"\n",
                "\"Oh! what on earth are you thinking of?\" said Christophe. \"You're as\nwell as I am.\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" said Olivier.\n",
                "\"Then why talk nonsense?\"\n",
                "\"I was wrong,\" said Olivier, ashamed and smiling. \"Influenza is so\ndepressing.\"\n",
                "\"Pull yourself together, though! Get up.\"\n",
                "\"Not now. Later on.\"\n",
                "He stayed in bed, dreaming. Next day he got up. But he was only able to\nsit musing by the fireside. It was a mild and misty April. Through the\nsoft veil of silvery mist the little green leaves were unfolding their\ncocoons, and invisible birds were singing the song of the hidden sun.\nOlivier wound the skein of his memories. He saw himself once more as a\nchild, in the train carrying him away from his native town, through the\nmist, with his mother weeping. Antoinette was sitting by herself at the\nother end of the carriage.... Delicate shapes, fine landscapes, were\ndrawn in his mind's eye. Lovely verses came of their own accord, with\nevery syllable and charming rhythm in due order. He was near his desk:\nhe had only to reach out his hand to take his pen and write down his\npoetic visions. But his will failed him: he was tired: he knew that the\nperfume of his dreams would evaporate so soon as he tried to catch and\nhold them. It was always so: the best of himself could never find\nexpression: his mind was like a little valley full of flowers: but\nhardly a soul had access to it: and as soon as they were picked the\nflowers faded. No more than just a few had been able languidly to\nsurvive, a few delicate little tales, a few pieces of verse, which all\ngave out a fragrant, fading scent. His artistic impotence had for a long\ntime been one of Olivier's greatest griefs. It was so hard to feel so\nmuch life in himself and to be able to save none of it!...--Now he was\nresigned. Flowers do not need to be seen to blossom. They are only the\nmore beautiful in the fields where no hand can pluck them. Happy, happy\nfields with flowers dreaming in the sun!--Here in the little valley\nthere was hardly any sun; but Olivier's dreams flowered all the better\nfor it. What stories he wove for his own delight in those days, stories\nsad and tender and fantastic! They came he knew not whence, sailing like\nwhite clouds in a summer sky, melted into thin air, and others followed\nthem: he was full of them. Sometimes the sky was clear: in the light of\nit Olivier would sit drowsily until once more, with all sail set, there\nwould come gliding the silent ships of dreams.\n",
                "In the evening the little hunchback would come in. Olivier was so full\nof stories that he told him one, smiling, eager and engrossed in the\ntale. Often he would go on talking to himself, with the boy breathing\nnever a word. In the end he would altogether forget his presence....\nChristophe arrived in the middle of the story, and was struck by its\nbeauty, and asked Olivier to begin all over again. Olivier refused:\n",
                "\"I am in the same position as yourself,\" he said. \"I don't know anything\nabout it.\"\n",
                "\"That is not true,\" said Christophe. \"You're a regular Frenchman, and\nyou always know exactly what you are doing and saying. You never forget\nanything.\"\n",
                "\"Alas!\" said Olivier.\n",
                "\"Begin again, then.\"\n",
                "\"I'm too tired. What's the good?\"\n",
                "Christophe was annoyed.\n",
                "\"That's all wrong,\" he said. \"What's the good of your having ideas? You\nthrow away what you have. It's an utter waste.\" \"Nothing is ever lost,\"\nsaid Olivier.\n",
                "The little hunchback started from the stillness he had maintained during\nOlivier's story--sitting with his face towards the window, with eyes\nblankly staring, and a frown on his face and a fierce expression so that\nit was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He got up and said:\n",
                "\"It will be fine to-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"I bet,\" said Christophe to Olivier, \"that he didn't even listen.\"\n",
                "\"To-morrow, the First of May,\" Emmanuel went on, while his morose\nexpression lighted up.\n",
                "\"That is his story,\" said Olivier. \"You shall tell it me tomorrow.\"\n\"Nonsense!\" said Christophe.\n",
                "Next day Christophe called for Olivier to take him for a walk in Paris.\nOlivier was better: but he still had the same strange feeling of\nexhaustion: he did not want to go out, he had a vague fear, he did not\nlike mixing with the crowd. His heart and mind were brave: but the flesh\nwas weak. He was afraid of a crush, an affray, brutality of all sorts:\nhe knew only too well that he was fated to be a victim, that he could\nnot, even would not, defend himself: for he had as great a horror of\ngiving pain as of suffering it himself. Men who are sick in body shudder\naway from physical suffering more readily than others, because they are\nmore familiar with it, because they have less power to resist, and\nbecause it is presented more immediately and more poignantly to their\nheated imagination. Olivier was ashamed of this physical cowardice of\nhis which was in entire contradiction to the stoicism of his will: and\nhe tried hard to fight it down. But this morning the thought of human\ncontact of any sort was painful to him, and he would gladly have\nremained indoors all day long. Christophe scolded him, rallied him,\nabsolutely insisted on his going out and throwing off his stupor: for\nquite ten days he had not had a breath of air. Olivier pretended not to\npay any attention. Christophe said:\n",
                "\"Very well. I'll go without you. I want to see their First of May. If I\ndon't come back to-night, you will know that I have been locked up.\"\n",
                "He went out. Olivier caught him up on the stairs. He would not leave\nChristophe to go alone.\n",
                "There were very few people in the streets. A few little work-girls\nwearing sprays of lily-of-the-valley. Working-people in their Sunday\nclothes were walking about rather listlessly. At the street corners, and\nnear the M\u00e9tro stations were groups of policemen in plain clothes. The\ngates of the Luxembourg were closed. The weather was still foggy and\ndamp. It was a long, long time since the sun had shown himself!... The\nfriends walked arm in arm. They spoke but little, but they were very\nglad of each other. A few words were enough to call up all their tender\nmemories of the intimate past. They stopped in front of a _mairie_\nto look at the barometer, which had an upward tendency.\n",
                "\"To-morrow,\" said Olivier, \"I shall see the sun.\"\n",
                "They were quite near the house where C\u00e9cile lived. They thought of going\nin and giving the baby a hug.\n",
                "\"No. We can do it when we come back.\"\n",
                "On the other side of the river they began to fall in with more people.\nJust ordinary peaceful people taking a walk, wearing their Sunday\nclothes and faces; poor people with their babies: workmen loafing. A few\nhere and there wore the red eglantine in their buttonholes: they looked\nquite inoffensive: they were revolutionaries by dint of self-persuasion:\nthey were obviously quite benevolent and optimistic at heart, well\nsatisfied with the smallest opportunities for happiness: whether it were\nfine or merely passable for their holiday, they were grateful for it ...\nthey did not know exactly to whom ... to everything and everybody about\nthem. They walked along without any hurry, expansively admiring the new\nleaves of the trees and the pretty dresses of the little girls who went\nby: they said proudly:\n",
                "\"Only in Paris can you see children so well dressed as that.\"\n",
                "Christophe made fun of the famous upheaval that had been predicted....\nSuch nice people!... He was quite fond of them, although a little\ncontemptuous.\n",
                "As they got farther along the crowd thickened. Men with pale hangdog\nfaces and horrible mouths slipped into the stream of people, all on the\nalert, waiting for the time to pounce on their prey. The mud was stirred\nup. With every inch the river grew more and more turbid. Now it flowed\nslowly thick, opaque, and heavy. Like air-bubbles rising from the depths\nto the greasy surface, there came up calling voices, shrill whistles,\nthe cries of the newsboys, piercing the dull roar of the multitude, and\nmade it possible to take the measure of its strata. At the end of a\nstreet, near Am\u00e9lie's restaurant, there was a noise like that of a\nmill-race. The crowd was stemmed up against several ranks of police and\nsoldiers. In front of the obstacles a serried mass was formed, howling,\nwhistling, singing, laughing, and eddying this way and that.... The\nlaughter of the people is the only means they have of expressing a\nthousand obscure and yet deep feelings which cannot find an outlet in\nwords!...\n",
                "The multitude was not hostile. The people did not know what they wanted.\nUntil they did know they were content to amuse themselves--after their\nown nervous, brutal fashion, still without malice--to amuse themselves\nwith pushing and being pushed, insulting the police and each other. But\nlittle by little, they lost their ardor. Those who came up from behind\ngot tired of being able to see nothing, and were the more provocative\ninasmuch as they ran little risk behind the shelter of the human\nbarricade in front of them. Those in front, being crushed between those\nwho were pushing and those who were offering resistance, grew more and\nmore exasperated as their position became more and more intolerable: the\nforce of the current pushing them on increased their own force an\nhundredfold. And all of them, as they were squeezed closer and closer\ntogether, like cattle, felt the warmth of the whole herd creeping\nthrough their breasts and their loins: and it seemed to them then that\nthey formed a solid block: and each was all, each was a giant with the\narms of Briareus. Every now and then a wave of blood would surge to the\nheart of the thousand-headed monster: eyes would dart hatred, murderous\ncries would go up. Men cowering away in the third and fourth row began\nto throw stones. Whole families were looking down from the windows of\nthe houses: it was like being at the play: they excited the mob and\nwaited with a little thrill of agonized impatience for the troops to\ncharge.\n",
                "Christophe forced his way through the dense throng with elbows and\nknees, like a wedge. Olivier followed him. The living mass parted for a\nmoment to let them pass and closed again at once behind them. Christophe\nwas in fine fettle. He had entirely forgotten that only five minutes ago\nhe had denied the possibility of an upheaval of the people. Hardly had\nhe set foot inside the stream than he was swept along: though he was a\nforeigner in this crowd of Frenchmen and a stranger to their demands,\nyet he was suddenly engulfed by them: little he cared what they wanted:\nhe wanted it too: little he cared whither they were going: he was going\ntoo, drinking in the breath of their madness.\n",
                "Olivier was dragged along after him, but it was no joy to him; he saw\nclearly, he never lost his self-consciousness, and was a thousand times\nmore a stranger to the passions of these people who were his people than\nChristophe, and yet he was carried away by them like a piece of\nwreckage. His illness, which had weakened him, had also relaxed\neverything that bound him to life. How far removed he felt from these\npeople!... Being free from the delirium that was in them and having all\nhis wits at liberty, his mind took in the minutest details. It gave him\npleasure to gaze at the bust of a girl standing in front of him and at\nher pretty, white neck. And at the same time he was disgusted by the\nsickly, thick smell that was given off from the close-packed heap of\nbodies.\n",
                "\"Christophe!\" he begged.\n",
                "Christophe did not hear him.\n",
                "\"Christophe!\"\n",
                "\"Eh?\"\n",
                "\"Let's go home.\"\n",
                "\"You're afraid?\" said Christophe.\n",
                "He pushed on. Olivier followed him with a sad smile.\n",
                "A few rows in front of them, in the danger zone where the people were so\nhuddled together as to form a solid barricade, he saw his friend the\nlittle hunchback perched on the roof of a newspaper kiosk. He was\nclinging with both hands, and crouching in a most uncomfortable\nposition, and laughing as he looked over the wall of soldiers: and then\nhe would turn again and look back at the crowd with an air of triumph.\nHe saw Olivier and beamed at him: then once more he began to peer across\nthe soldiers, over the square, with his eyes wide staring in hope and\nexpectation ... of what?--Of the thing which was to come to pass.... He\nwas not alone. There were many, many others all around him waiting for\nthe miracle! And Olivier, looking at Christophe, saw that he too was\nexpecting it.\n",
                "He called to the boy and shouted to him to come down. Emmanuel pretended\nnot to hear and looked away. He had seen Christophe. He was glad to be\nin a position of peril in the turmoil, partly to show his courage to\nOlivier, partly to punish him for being with Christophe.\n",
                "Meanwhile they had come across some of their friends in the\ncrowd,--Coquard, with his golden beard, who expected nothing more than a\nlittle jostling and crushing, and with the eye of an expert was watching\nfor the moment when the vessel would overflow. Farther on they met the\nfair Berthe, who was slanging the people about her and getting roughly\nmauled. She had succeeded in wriggling through to the front row, and she\nwas hurling insults at the police. Coquard came up to Christophe. When\nChristophe saw him he began to chaff him:\n",
                "\"What did I tell you? Nothing is going to happen.\"\n",
                "\"That remains to be seen!\" said Coquard. \"Don't you be too sure. It\nwon't be long before the fun begins.\"\n",
                "\"Rot!\" said Christophe.\n",
                "At that very moment the cuirassiers, getting tired of having stones\nflung at them, marched forward to clear the entrances to the square: the\ncentral body came forward at a double. Immediately the stampede began.\nAs the Gospel has it, the first were last. But they took good care not\nto be last for long. By way of covering their confusion the runaways\nyelled at the soldiers following them and screamed: \"Assassins!\" long\nbefore a single blow had been struck. Berthe wriggled through the crowd\nlike an eel, shrieking at the top of her voice. She rejoined her\nfriends; and taking shelter behind Coquard's broad back, she recovered\nher breath, pressed close up against Christophe, gripped his arm, in\nfear or for some other reason, ogled Olivier, and shook her fist at the\nenemy, and screeched. Coquard took Christophe's arm and said:\n",
                "\"Let's go to Am\u00e9lie's,\"\n",
                "They had very little way to go. Berthe had preceded them with Graillot\nand a few workmen. Christophe was on the point of entering followed by\nOlivier. The street had a shelving ridge. The pavement, by the creamery,\nwas five or six steps higher than the roadway. Olivier stopped to take a\nlong breath after his escape from the crowd. He disliked the idea of\nbeing in the poisoned air of the restaurant and the clamorous voices of\nthese fanatics. He said to Christopher:\n",
                "\"I'm going home.\"\n",
                "\"Very well, then, old fellow,\" said Christophe. \"I'll rejoin you in an\nhour from now.\"\n",
                "\"Don't run any risks, Christophe!\"\n",
                "\"Coward!\" said Christophe, laughing.\n",
                "He turned into the creamery.\n",
                "Olivier walked along to the corner of the shop. A few steps more and he\nwould be in a little by-street which would take him out of the uproar.\nThe thought of his little protege crossed his mind. He turned to look\nfor him. He saw him at the very moment when Emmanuel had slipped down\nfrom his coign of vantage and was rolling on the ground being trampled\nunderfoot by the rabble: the fugitives were running over his body: the\npolice were just reaching the spot. Olivier did not stop to think: he\nrushed down the steps and ran to his aid. A navvy saw the danger, the\nsoldiers with drawn sabers. Olivier holding out his hand to the boy to\nhelp him up, the savage rush of the police knocked them both over. He\nshouted out, and in his turn rushed in. Some of his comrades followed at\na run. Others rushed down from the threshold of the restaurant, and, on\ntheir cries, came those who had already entered. The two bodies of men\nhurled themselves at each other's throats like dogs. And the women,\nstanding at the top of the steps, screamed and yelled.--So Olivier, the\naristocrat, the essentially middle-class nature, released the spring of\nthe battle, which no man desired less than he.\n",
                "Christophe was swept along by the workmen and plunged into the fray\nwithout knowing who had been the cause of it. Nothing was farther from\nhis thoughts than that Olivier had taken part in it. He thought him far\naway in safety. It was impossible to see anything of the fight. Every\nman had enough to do in keeping an eye on his opponent. Olivier had\ndisappeared in the whirlpool like a foundered ship. He had received a\njab from a bayonet, meant for some one else, in his left breast: he\nfell: the crowd trampled him underfoot. Christophe had been swept away\nby an eddy to the farthest extremity of the field of battle. He did not\nfight with any animosity: he jostled and was jostled with a fierce zest\nas though he was in the throng at a village fair. So little did he think\nof the serious nature of the affair that when he was gripped by a huge,\nbroad-shouldered policeman and closed with him, he saw the thing in\ngrotesque and said:\n",
                "\"My waltz, I think.\"\n",
                "But when another policeman pounced on to his back, he shook himself like\na wild boar, and hammered away with his fists at the two of them: he had\nno intention of being taken prisoner. One of his adversaries, the man\nwho had seized him from behind, rolled down on the ground. The other\nlost his head and drew his sword. Christophe saw the point of the saber\ncome within a hand's breadth of his chest: he dodged, and twisted the\nman's wrist and tried to wrench his weapon from him. He could not\nunderstand it: till then it had seemed to him just a game. They went on\nstruggling and battering at each other's faces. He had no time to stop\nto think. He saw murder in the other man's eyes: and murderous desire\nawoke in him. He saw that the man would slit him up like a sheep. With a\nsudden movement he turned the man's hand and sword against himself: he\nplunged the sword into his breast, felt that he was killing him, and\nkilled him. And suddenly the whole thing was changed: he was mad,\nintoxicated, and he roared aloud.\n",
                "His yells produced an indescribable effect. The crowd had smelt blood.\nIn a moment it became a savage pack. On all sides swords were drawn. The\nred flag appeared in the windows of the houses. And old memories of\nParisian revolutions prompted them to build a barricade. The stones were\ntorn up from the street, the gas lamps were wrenched away, trees were\npulled up, an omnibus was overturned. A trench that had been left open\nfor months in connection with work on the _M\u00e9tropolitain_ was\nturned to account. The cast-iron railings round the trees were broken up\nand used as missiles. Weapons were brought out of pockets and from the\nhouses. In less than an hour the scuffle had grown into an insurrection:\nthe whole district was in a state of siege. And, on the barricade, was\nChristophe, unrecognizable, shouting his revolutionary song, which was\ntaken up by a score of voices. Olivier had been carried to Am\u00e9lie's. He\nwas unconscious. He had been laid on a bed in the dark back-shop. At the\nfoot of the bed stood the hunchback, numbed and distraught. At first\nBerthe had been overcome with emotion: at a distance she had thought it\nwas Graillot who had been wounded, and, when she recognized Olivier, her\nfirst exclamation had been:\n",
                "\"What a good thing! I thought it was L\u00e9opold.\"\n",
                "But now she was full of pity.. And she kissed Olivier and held his head\non the pillow. With her usual calmness Am\u00e9lie had undone his clothes and\ndressed his wound. Manousse Heimann was there, fortunately, with his\ninseparable Canet. Like Christophe they had come out of curiosity to see\nthe demonstration: they had been present at the affray and seen Olivier\nfall. Canet was blubbering like a child: and at the same time he was\nthinking:\n",
                "\"What on earth am I doing here?\"\n",
                "Manousse examined Olivier: at once he saw that it was all over. He had a\ngreat feeling for Olivier: but he was not a man to worry about what\ncan't be helped: and he turned his thoughts to Christophe. He admired\nChristophe though he regarded him as a pathological case. He knew his\nideas about the Revolution: and he wanted to deliver him from the\nidiotic danger he was running in a cause that was not his own. The risk\nof a broken head in the scuffle was not the only one: if Christophe were\ntaken, everything pointed to his being used as an example and getting\nmore than he bargained for. Manousse had long ago been warned that the\npolice had their eye on Christophe: they would saddle him not only with\nhis own follies but with those of others. Xavier Bernard, whom Manousse\nhad just encountered, prowling through the crowd, for his own amusement\nas well as in pursuit of duty, had nodded to him as he passed and said:\n",
                "\"That Krafft of yours is an idiot. Would you believe that he's putting\nhimself up as a mark on the barricade! We shan't miss him this time.\nYou'd better get him out of harm's way.\"\n",
                "That was easier said than done. If Christophe were to find out that\nOlivier was dying he would become a raging madman, he would go out to\nkill, he would be killed. Manousse said to Bernard:\n",
                "\"If he doesn't go at once, he's done for. I'll try and take him away.\"\n",
                "\"How?\"\n",
                "\"In Canet's motor. It's over there at the corner of the street.\"\n",
                "\"Please, please....\" gulped Canet.\n",
                "\"You must take him to Laroche,\" Manousse went on. \"You will get there in\ntime to catch the Pontarlier express. You must pack him off to\nSwitzerland.\"\n",
                "\"He won't go.\"\n",
                "\"He will. I'll tell him that Jeannin will follow him, or has already\ngone.\"\n",
                "Without paying any attention to Canet's objections Manousse set out to\nfind Christophe on the barricade. He was not very courageous, he started\nevery time he heard a shot: and he counted the cobble-stones over which\nhe stepped--(odd or even), to make out his chances of being killed. He\ndid not stop, but went through with it. When he reached the barricade he\nfound Christophe, perched on a wheel of the overturned omnibus, amusing\nhimself by firing pistol-shots into the air. Round the barricade the\nriff-raff of Paris, spewed up from the gutters, had swollen up like the\ndirty water from a sewer after heavy rain. The original combatants were\ndrowned by it. Manousse shouted to Christophe, whose back was turned to\nhim. Christophe did not hear him. Manousse climbed up to him and plucked\nat his sleeve. Christophe pushed him away and almost knocked him down.\nManousse stuck to it, climbed up again, and shouted:\n",
                "\"Jeannin....\"\n",
                "In the uproar the rest of the sentence was lost. Christophe stopped\nshort, dropped his revolver, and, slipping down from his scaffolding, he\nrejoined Manousse, who started pulling him away.\n",
                "\"You must clear out,\" said Manousse.\n",
                "\"Where is Olivier?\"\n",
                "\"You must clear out,\" repeated Manousse.\n",
                "\"Why?\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"The barricade will be captured in an hour. You will be arrested\nto-night.\"\n",
                "\"What have I done?\"\n",
                "\"Look at your hands.... Come!... There's no room for doubt, they won't\nspare you. Everybody recognized you. You've not got a moment to lose.\"\n",
                "\"Where is Olivier?\"\n",
                "\"At home.\"\n",
                "\"I'll go and join him.\"\n",
                "\"You can't do that. The police are waiting for you at the door. He sent\nme to warn you. You must cut and run.\"\n",
                "\"Where do you want me to go?\"\n",
                "\"To Switzerland. Canet will take you out of this in his car.\"\n",
                "\"And Olivier?\"\n",
                "\"There's no time to talk....\"\n",
                "\"I won't go without seeing him.\"\n",
                "\"You'll see him there. He'll join you to-morrow. He'll go by the first\ntrain. Quick! I'll explain.\"\n",
                "He caught hold of Christophe. Christophe was dazed by the noise and the\nwave of madness that had rushed through him, could not understand what\nhe had done and what he was being asked to do, and let himself be\ndragged away. Manousse took his arm, and with his other hand caught hold\nof Canet, who was not at all pleased with the part allotted to him in\nthe affair: and he packed the two of them into the car. The worthy Canet\nwould have been bitterly sorry if Christophe had been caught, but he\nwould have much preferred some one else to help him to escape. Manousse\nknew his man. And as he had some qualms about Canet's cowardice, he\nchanged his mind just as he was leaving them and the car was getting\ninto its stride and climbed up and sat with them.\n",
                "Olivier did not recover consciousness. Am\u00e9lie and the little hunchback\nwere left alone in the room. Such a sad room it was, airless and gloomy!\nIt was almost dark.... For one instant Olivier emerged from the abyss.\nHe felt Emmanuel's tears and kisses on his hand. He smiled faintly, and\npainfully laid his hand on the boy's head. Such a heavy hand it was!...\nThen he sank back once more....\n",
                "By the dying man's head, on the pillow, Am\u00e9lie had laid a First of May\nnosegay, a few sprays of lily-of-the-valley. A leaky tap in the\ncourtyard dripped, dripped into a bucket. For a second mental images\nhovered tremblingly at the back of his mind, like a light flickering and\ndying down ... a house in the country with glycine on the walls: a\ngarden where a child was playing: a boy lying on the turf: a little\nfountain plashing in its stone basin: a little girl laughing....\n"

                "They drove out of Paris. They crossed the vast plains of France shrouded\nin mist. It was an evening like that on which Christophe had arrived in\nParis ten years before. He was a fugitive then, as now. But then his\nfriend, the man who loved him, was alive: and Christophe was fleeing\ntowards him....\n",
                "During the first hour Christophe was still under the excitement of the\nfight: he talked volubly in a loud voice: in a breathless, jerky fashion\nhe kept on telling what he had seen and heard: he was proud of his\nachievement and felt no remorse. Manousse and Canet talked too, by way\nof making him forget. Gradually his feverish excitement subsided, and\nChristophe stopped talking: his two companions went on making\nconversation alone. He was a little bewildered by the afternoon's\nadventures, but in no way abashed. He recollected the time when he had\ncome to France, a fugitive then, always a fugitive. It made him laugh.\nNo doubt he was fated to be so. It gave him no pain to be leaving Paris:\nthe world is wide: men are the same everywhere. It mattered little to\nhim where he might be so long as he was with his friend. He was counting\non seeing him again next day. They had promised him that.\n",
                "They reached Laroche. Manousse and Canet did not leave him until they\nhad seen him into the train. Christophe made them say over the name of\nthe place where he was to get out, and the name of the hotel, and the\npost-office where he would find his letters. In spite of themselves, as\nthey left him, they both looked utterly dejected. Christophe wrung their\nhands gaily.\n",
                "\"Come!\" he shouted, \"don't look so like a funeral Good Lord, we shall\nmeet again! Nothing easier! We'll write to each other to-morrow.\"\n",
                "The train started. They watched it disappear.\n",
                "\"Poor devil!\" said Manousse.\n",
                "They got back into the car. They were silent. After a short time Canet\nsaid to Manousse:\n",
                "\"Bah! the dead are dead. We must help the living.\"\n",
                "As night fell Christophe's excitement subsided altogether. He sat\nhuddled in a corner of the carriage, and pondered. He was sobered and\nicy cold. He looked down at his hands and saw blood on them that was not\nhis own. He gave a shiver of disgust. The scene of the murder came\nbefore him once more. He remembered that he had killed a man: and now he\nknew not why. He began to go over the whole battle from the very\nbeginning; but now he saw it in a very different light. He could not\nunderstand how he had got mixed up in it. He went back over every\nincident of the day from the moment when he had left the house with\nOlivier: he saw the two of them walking through Paris until the moment\nwhen he had been caught up by the whirlwind. There he lost the thread:\nthe chain of his thoughts was snapped: how could he have shouted and\nstruck out and moved with those men with whose beliefs he disagreed? It\nwas not he, it was not he!... It was a total eclipse of his will!... He\nwas dazed by it and ashamed. He was not his own master then? Who was his\nmaster?... He was being carried by the express through the night: and\nthe inward night through which he was being carried was no less dark,\nnor was the unknown force less swift and dizzy.... He tried hard to\nshake off his unease: but one anxiety was followed by another. The\nnearer he came to his destination, the more he thought of Olivier; and\nhe was oppressed by an unreasoning fear.\n",
                "As he arrived he looked through the window across the platform for the\nfamiliar face of his friend.... There was no one. He got out and still\nwent on looking about him. Once or twice he thought he saw.... No, it\nwas not \"he.\" He went to the appointed hotel. Olivier was not there.\nThere was no reason for Christophe to be surprised: how could Olivier\nhave preceded him?... But from that moment on he was in an agony of\nsuspense.\n",
                "It was morning. Christophe went up to his room. Then he came down again,\nhad breakfast, sauntered through the streets. He pretended to be free of\nanxiety and looked at the lake and the shop-windows, chaffed the girl in\nthe restaurant, and turned over the illustrated papers.... Nothing\ninterested him. The day dragged through, slowly and heavily. About seven\no'clock in the evening, Christophe having, for want of anything else to\ndo, dined early and eaten nothing, went up to his room, and asked that\nas soon as the friend he was expecting arrived, he should be brought up\nto him. He sat down at the desk with his back turned to the door. He had\nnothing to busy himself with, no baggage, no books: only a paper that he\nhad just bought: he forced himself to read it: but his mind was\nwandering: he was listening for footsteps in the corridor. All his\nnerves were on edge with the exhaustion of a day's anxious waiting and a\nsleepless night.\n",
                "Suddenly he heard some one open the door. Some indefinable feeling made\nhim not turn around at once. He felt a hand on his shoulder. Then he\nturned and saw Olivier smiling at him. He was not surprised, and said:\n",
                "\"Ah, here you are at last!\"\n",
                "The illusion vanished.\n",
                "Christophe got up suddenly, knocking over chair and table. His hair\nstood on end. He stood still for a moment, livid, with his teeth\nchattering.\n",
                "At the end of that moment--(in vain did he shut his eyes to it and tell\nhimself: \"I know nothing\")--he knew everything: he was sure of what he\nwas going to hear.\n",
                "He could not stay in his room. He went down into the street and walked\nabout for an hour. When he returned the porter met him in the hall of\nthe hotel and gave him a letter. _The_ letter. He was quite sure it\nwould be there. His hand trembled as he took it. He opened it, saw that\nOlivier was dead, and fainted.\n",
                "The letter was from Manousse. It said that in concealing the disaster\nfrom him the day before, and hurrying him off, they had only been\nobeying Olivier's wishes, who had desired to insure his friend's\nescape,--that it was useless for Christophe to stay, as it would mean\nthe end of him also,--that it was his duty to seek safety for the sake\nof his friend's memory, and for his other friends, and for the sake of\nhis own fame, etc., etc.... Am\u00e9lie had added three lines in her big,\nscrawling handwriting, to say that she would take every care of the poor\nlittle gentleman....\n",
                "When Christophe came back to himself he was furiously angry. He wanted\nto kill Manousse. He ran to the station. The hall of the hotel was\nempty, the streets were deserted: in the darkness the few belated\npassers-by did not notice his wildly staring eyes or his furious\nbreathing. His mind had fastened as firmly as a bulldog with its fangs\non to the one fixed idea: \"Kill Manousse! Kill!...\" He wanted to return\nto Paris. The night express had gone an hour before. He had to wait\nuntil the next morning. He could not wait. He took the first train that\nwent in the direction of Paris, a train which stopped at every station.\nWhen he was left alone in the carriage Christophe cried over and over\nagain:\n",
                "\"It is not true! It is not true!\"\n",
                "At the second station across the French frontier the train stopped\naltogether: it did not go any farther. Shaking with fury, Christophe got\nout and asked for another train, battering the sleepy officials with\nquestions, and only knocking up against indifference. Whatever he did he\nwould arrive too late. Too late for Olivier. He could not even manage to\ncatch Manousse. He would be arrested first. What was he to do? Which way\nto turn? To go on? To go back? What was the use? What was the use?... He\nthought of giving himself up to a gendarme who went past him. He was\nheld back by an obscure instinct for life which bade him return to\nSwitzerland. There was no train in either direction for a few hours.\nChristophe sat down in the waiting-room, could not keep still, left the\nstation, and blindly followed the road on through the night. He found\nhimself in the middle of a bare countryside--fields, broken here and\nthere with clumps of pines, the vanguard of a forest. He plunged into\nit. He had hardly gone more than a few steps when he flung himself down\non the ground and cried:\n",
                "\"Olivier!\"\n",
                "He lay across the path and sobbed.\n",
                "A long time afterwards a train whistling in the distance roused him and\nmade him get up. He tried to go back to the station, but took the wrong\nroad. He walked on all through the night. What did it matter to him\nwhere he went? He went on walking to keep from thinking, walking,\nwalking, until he could not think, walking on in the hope that he might\nfall dead. Ah! if only he might die!...\n",
                "At dawn he found himself in a French village a long way from the\nfrontier. All night he had been walking away from it. He went into an\ninn, ate a huge meal, set out once more, and walked on and on. During\nthe day he sank down in the middle of a field and lay there asleep until\nthe evening. When he woke up it was to face another night. His fury had\nabated. He was left only with frightful grief that choked him. He\ndragged himself to a farmhouse, and asked for a piece of bread and a\ntruss of straw for a bed. The farmer stared hard at him, cut him a slice\nof bread, led him into the stable, and locked it. Christophe lay in the\nstraw near the thickly-smelling cows, and devoured his bread. Tears were\nstreaming down his face. Neither his hunger nor his sorrow could be\nappeased. During the night sleep once more delivered him from his agony\nfor a few hours. He woke up next day on the sound of the door opening.\nHe lay still and did not move. He did not want to come back to life. The\nfarmer stopped and looked down at him for a long time: he was holding in\nhis hand a paper, at which he glanced from time to time. At last he\nmoved forward and thrust his newspaper in front of Christophe. His\nportrait was on the front page.\n",
                "\"It is I,\" said Christophe. \"You'd better give me up.\"\n",
                "\"Get up,\" said the farmer.\n",
                "Christophe got up. The man motioned to him to follow. They went behind\nthe barn and walked along a winding path through an orchard. They came\nto a cross, and then the farmer pointed along a road and said to\nChristophe:\n",
                "\"The frontier is over there.\"\n",
                "Christophe walked on mechanically. He did not know why he should go on.\nHe was so tired, so broken in body and soul, that he longed to stop with\nevery stride. But he felt that if he were to stop he would never be able\nto go on again, never budge from the spot where he fell. He walked on\nright through the day. He had not a penny to buy bread. Besides, he\navoided the villages. He had a queer feeling which entirely baffled his\nreason, that, though he wished to die, he was afraid of being taken\nprisoner: his body was like a hunted animal fleeing before its captors.\nHis physical wretchedness, exhaustion, hunger, an obscure feeling of\nterror which was augmented by his worn-out condition, for the time being\nsmothered his moral distress. His one thought was to find a refuge where\nhe could in safety be alone with his distress and feed on it.\n",
                "He crossed the frontier. In the distance he saw a town surmounted with\ntowers and steeples and factory chimneys, from which the thick smoke\nstreamed like black rivers, monotonously, all in the same direction\nacross the gray sky under the rain. He was very near a collapse. Just\nthen he remembered that he knew a German doctor, one Erich Braun, who\nlived in the town, and had written to him the year before, after one of\nhis successes, to remind him of their old acquaintance. Dull though\nBraun might be, little though he might enter into his life, yet, like a\nwounded animal, Christophe made a supreme effort before he gave in to\nreach the house of some one who was not altogether a stranger.\n",
                "Under the cloud of smoke and rain, he entered the gray and red city. He\nwalked through it, seeing nothing, asking his way, losing himself, going\nback, wandering aimlessly. He was at the end of his tether. For the last\ntime he screwed up his will that was so near to breaking-point to climb\nup the steep alleys, and the stairs which went to the top of a stiff\nlittle hill, closely overbuilt with houses round a gloomy church. There\nwere sixty red stone steps in threes and sixes. Between each little\nflight of steps was a narrow platform for the door of a house. On each\nplatform Christophe stopped swaying to take breath. Far over his head,\nabove the church tower, crows were whirling.\n",
                "At last he came upon the name he was looking for. He knocked.--The alley\nwas in darkness. In utter weariness he closed his eyes. All was dark\nwithin him.... Ages passed.\n",
                "The narrow door was opened. A woman appeared on the threshold. Her face\nwas in darkness: but her outline was sharply shown against the\nbackground of a little garden which could be clearly seen at the end of\na long passage, in the light of the setting sun. She was tall, and stood\nvery erect, without a word, waiting for him to speak. He could not see\nher eyes: but he felt them taking him in. He asked for Doctor Erich\nBraun and gave his name. He had great difficulty in getting the words\nout. He was worn out with fatigue, hunger, and thirst. Without a word\nthe woman went away, and Christophe followed her into a room with closed\nshutters. In the darkness he bumped into her: his knees and body brushed\nagainst her. She went out again and closed the door of the room and left\nhim in the dark. He stayed quite still, for fear of knocking something\nover, leaning against the wall with his forehead against the soft\nhangings: his ears buzzed: the darkness seemed alive and throbbing to\nhis eyes.\n",
                "Overhead he heard a chair being moved, an exclamation of surprise, a\ndoor slammed. Then came heavy footsteps down the stairs.\n",
                "\"Where is he?\" asked a voice that he knew.\n",
                "The door of the room was opened once more.\n",
                "\"What! You left him in the dark! Anna! Good gracious! A light!\"\n",
                "Christophe was so weak, he was so utterly wretched, that the sound of\nthe man's loud voice, cordial as it was, brought him comfort in his\nmisery. He gripped the hand that was held out to him. The two men looked\nat each other. Braun was a little man: he had a red face with a black,\nscrubby and untidy beard, kind eyes twinkling behind spectacles, a\nbroad, bumpy, wrinkled, worried, inexpressive brow, hair carefully\nplastered down and parted right down to his neck. He was very ugly: but\nChristophe was very glad to see him and to be shaking hands with him.\nBraun made no effort to conceal his surprise.\n",
                "\"Good Heavens! How changed he is! What a state he is in!\"\n",
                "\"I'm just come from Paris,\" said Christophe, \"I'm a fugitive.\"\n",
                "\"I know, I know. We saw the papers. They said you were caught. Thank\nGod! You've been much in our thoughts, mine and Anna's.\"\n",
                "He stopped and made Christophe known to the silent creature who had\nadmitted him:\n",
                "\"My wife.\"\n",
                "She had stayed in the doorway of the room with a lamp in her hand. She\nhad a taciturn face with a firm chin. The light fell on her brown hair\nwith its reddish shades of color, and on her pallid cheeks. She held out\nher hand to Christophe stiffly with the elbow close against her side: he\ntook it without looking at her. He was almost done.\n",
                "\"I came....\" he tried to explain. \"I thought you would be so kind ... if\nit isn't putting you out too much ... as to put me up for a day--\"\n",
                "Braun did not let him finish.\n",
                "\"A day!... Twenty days, fifty, as long as you like. As long as you are\nin this country you shall stay in our house: and I hope you will stay\nfor a long time. It is an honor and a great happiness for us.\"\n",
                "Christophe was overwhelmed by his kind words. He flung himself into\nBraun's arms.\n",
                "\"My dear Christophe, my dear Christophe!\" said Braun.... \"He is\nweeping.... Well, well what is it?... Anna! Anna!... Quick, he has\nfainted....\"\n",
                "Christophe had collapsed in his host's arms. He had succumbed to the\nfainting fit which had been imminent for several hours.\n",
                "When he opened his eyes again he was lying in a great bed. A smell of\nwet earth came up through the open window. Braun was bending over him.\n",
                "\"Forgive me,\" murmured Christophe, trying to get up.\n",
                "\"He is dying of hunger!\" cried Braun.\n",
                "The woman went out and returned with a cup and gave him to drink. Braun\nheld his head. Christophe was restored to life: but his exhaustion was\nstronger than his hunger: hardly was his head laid back on the pillow\nthan he went to sleep. Braun and his wife watched over him: then, seeing\nthat he only needed rest, they left him.\n",
                "He fell into the sort of sleep that seems to last for years, a heavy\ncrushing sleep, dropping like a piece of lead to the bottom of a lake.\nIn such a sleep a man is a prey to his accumulated weariness and the\nmonstrous hallucinations which are forever prowling at the gates of his\nwill. He tried to wake up, burning, broken, lost in the impenetrable\ndarkness: he heard the clocks striking the half hours: he could not\nbreathe, or think, or move: he was bound and gagged like a man flung\ninto water to drown: he tried to struggle, but only sank down\nagain.--Dawn came at length, the tardy gray dawn of a rainy day. The\nintolerable heat that consumed him grew less: but his body was pinned\nunder the weight of a mountain. He woke up. It was a terrible awakening.\n",
                "\"Why open my eyes? Why wake up? Rather stay, like my poor friend, who is\nlying under the earth....\"\n",
                "He lay on his back and never moved, although he was cramped by his\nposition in the bed: his legs and arms were heavy as stone. He was in a\ngrave. A dim pale light. A few drops of rain dashed against the windows.\nA bird in the garden was uttering a little plaintive cry. Oh! the misery\nof life! The cruel futility of it all!...\n",
                "The hours crept by. Braun came in. Christophe did not turn his head.\nSeeing his eyes open, Braun greeted him joyfully: and as Christophe went\non grimly staring at the ceiling he tried to make him shake off his\nmelancholy: he sat down on the bed and chattered noisily. Christophe\ncould not bear the noise. He made an effort, superhuman it seemed to\nhim, and said:\n",
                "\"Please leave me alone.\"\n",
                "The good little man changed his tone at once.\n",
                "\"You want to be alone? Why, of course. Keep quiet. Rest, don't talk,\nwe'll bring you up something to eat, and no one shall say a word.\"\n",
                "But it was impossible for him to be brief. After endless explanations he\ntiptoed from the room with his huge slippers creaking on the floor.\nChristophe was left alone once more, and sank back into his mortal\nweariness. His thoughts were veiled by the mist of suffering. He wore\nhimself out in trying to understand.... \"Why had he known him? Why had\nhe loved him? What good had Antoinette's devotion been? What was the\nmeaning of all the lives and generations,--so much experience and\nhope--ending in that life, dragged down with it into the void?\"... Life\nwas meaningless. Death was meaningless. A man was blotted out, shuffled\nout of existence, a whole family disappeared from the face of the earth,\nleaving no trace. Impossible to tell whether it is more odious or more\ngrotesque. He burst into a fit of angry laughter, laughter of hatred and\ndespair. His impotence in the face of such sorrow, his sorrow in the\nface of such impotence, were dragging him down to death. His heart was\nbroken....\n",
                "There was not a sound in the house, save the doctor's footsteps as he\nwent out on his rounds. Christophe had lost all idea of the time, when\nAnna appeared. She brought him some dinner on a tray. He watched her\nwithout stirring, without even moving his lips to thank her: but in his\nstaring eyes, which seemed to see nothing, the image of the young woman\nwas graven with photographic clarity. Long afterwards, when he knew her\nbetter, it was always thus that he saw her: later impressions were never\nable to efface that first memory of her. She had thick hair done up in a\nheavy knob, a bulging forehead, wide cheeks, a short, straight nose,\neyes perpetually cast down, and when they met the eyes of another, they\nwould turn away with an expression in which there was little frankness\nand small kindness: her lips were a trifle thick, and closely pressed\ntogether, and she had a stubborn, rather hard expression. She was tall,\napparently big and well made, but her clothes were very stiff and tight,\nand she was cramped in her movements. She came silently and noiselessly\nand laid the tray on the table by the bed and went out again with her\narms close to her sides and her head down. Christophe felt no surprise\nat her strange and rather absurd appearance: he did not touch his food\nand relapsed into his silent suffering.\n",
                "The day passed. Evening came and once more Anna with more food. She\nfound the meal she had brought in the morning still untouched: and she\ntook it away without a remark. She had none of those fond observations\nwhich all women seem instinctively to produce for the benefit of an\ninvalid. It was as though Christophe did not exist for her, as though\nshe herself hardly existed. This time Christophe felt a sort of dumb\nhostility as impatiently he followed her awkward hasty movements.\nHowever, he was grateful to her for not trying to talk.--He was even\nmore grateful to her when, after she had gone, he had to put up with the\ndoctor's protestations, when he observed that Christophe had not touched\nthe earlier meal. He was angry with his wife for not having forced\nChristophe to eat, and now tried to compel him to do so. For the sake of\npeace, Christophe had to gulp down a little milk. After that he turned\nhis back on him.\n",
                "The next night was more tranquil. Heavy sleep once more drew Christophe\ninto its state of nothingness. Not a trace of hateful life was\nleft.--But waking up was even more suffocating than before. He went on\nturning over and over all the details of the fateful day, Olivier's\nreluctance to leave the house, his urgent desire to go home, and he said\nto himself in despair:\n",
                "\"It was I who killed him....\"\n",
                "He could not bear to stay there any longer, shut up in that room, lying\nmotionless beneath the claws of the fierce-eyed sphinx that went on\nbattering him with its dizzy rain of questions and its deathlike breath.\nHe got up all in a fever: he dragged himself out of the room and went\ndownstairs: in his instinctive fear he was driven to cling to other\nhuman creatures. And as soon as he heard another voice he felt a longing\nto rush away.\n",
                "Braun was in the dining-room. He received Christophe with his usual\ndemonstrations of friendship and at once began to ply him with questions\nas to what had happened in Paris. Christophe seized him by the arm:\n",
                "\"No,\" he said. \"Don't ask me. Later on.... You mustn't mind. I can't,\nnow. I'm dead tired, worn out....\"\n",
                "\"I know, I know,\" said Braun kindly. \"Your nerves are shaken. The\nemotions of the last few days. Don't talk. Don't put yourself out in any\nway. You are free, you are at home here. No one will worry about you.\"\n",
                "He kept his word. By way of sparing his guest he went to the opposite\nextreme: he dared not even talk to his wife in Christophe's presence: he\ntalked in whispers and walked about on tiptoe: the house became still\nand silent. Exasperated by the whispering and the silence and the\naffectation of it all, Christophe had to beg Braun to go on living just\nas he usually did.\n",
                "For some days no one paid any attention to Christophe. He would sit for\nhours together in the corner of a room, or he would wander through the\nhouse like a man in a dream. What were his thoughts? He hardly knew. He\nhardly had even strength enough to suffer. He was crushed. The dryness\nof his heart was a horror to him. He had only one desire: to be buried\nwith \"him\" and to make an end.--One day he found the garden-door open\nand went out. But it hurt him so much to be in the light of day that he\nreturned hurriedly and shut himself up in his room with all the shutters\nclosed. Fine days were torture to him. He hated the sun. The brutal\nserenity of Nature overwhelmed him. At meals he would eat in silence the\nfood that Braun laid before him, and he would sit with never a word\nstaring down at the table. One day Braun pointed to the piano in the\ndrawing-room: Christophe turned from it in terror. Noise of any sort was\ndetestable to him. Silence, silence, and the night!... There was\nnothing in him save an aching void, and a need of emptiness. Gone was\nhis joy in life, gone the splendid bird of joy that once used to soar\nblithely, ecstatically upwards, pouring out song. There were days when,\nsitting in his room, he had no more feeling of life than the halting\ntic-tac of the clock in the next room, that seemed to be beating in his\nown brain. And yet, the wild bird of joy was still in him, it would\nsuddenly take flight, and flutter against the bars of its cage: and in\nthe depths of his soul there was a frightful tumult of sorrow--\"the\nbitter cry of one living in the wilderness....\"\n",
                "The world's misery lies in this, that a man hardly ever has a companion.\nWomen perhaps, and chance friendships. We are reckless in our use of the\nlovely word, friend. In reality we hardly have a single friend all\nthrough our lives. Rare, very rare, are those men who have real friends.\nBut the happiness of it is so great that it is impossible to live when\nthey are gone. The friend filled the life of his friend, unbeknown to\nhim, unmarked. The friend goes: and life is empty. Not only the beloved\nis lost, but every reason for loving, every reason for having loved. Why\nhad he lived? Why had either lived?\n",
                "The blow of Olivier's death was the more terrible to Christophe in that\nit fell just at a time when his whole nature was in a state of upheaval.\nThere are in life certain ages when there takes place a silently working\norganic change in a man: then body and soul are more susceptible to\nattack from without; the mind is weakened, its power is sapped by a\nvague sadness, a feeling of satiety, a sort of detachment from what it\nis doing, an incapacity for seeing any other course of action. At such\nperiods of their lives when these crises occur, the majority of men are\nbound by domestic ties, forming a safeguard for them, which, it is true,\ndeprives them of the freedom of mind necessary for self-judgment, for\ndiscovering where they stand, and for beginning to build up a healthy\nnew life. For them so many sorrows, so much bitterness and disgust\nremain concealed!... Onward! Onward! A man must ever be pressing on....\nThe common round, anxiety and care for the family for which he is\nresponsible, keep a man like a jaded horse, sleeping between the shafts,\nand trotting on and on.--But a free man has nothing to support him in\nhis hours of negation, nothing to force him to go on. He goes on as a\nmatter of habit: he knows not whither he is going. His powers are\nscattered, his consciousness is obscured. It is an awful thing for him\nif, just at the moment when he is most asleep, there comes a thunderclap\nto break in upon his somnambulism! Then he comes very nigh to\ndestruction.\n",
                "A few letters from Paris, which at last reached him, plucked Christophe\nfor a moment out of his despairing apathy. They were from C\u00e9cile and\nMadame Arnaud. They brought him messages of comfort. Cold comfort.\nFutile condolence. Those who talk about suffering know it not. The\nletters only brought him an echo of the voice that was gone.... He had\nnot the heart to reply: and the letters ceased. In his despondency he\ntried to blot out his tracks. To disappear.... Suffering is unjust: all\nthose who had loved him dropped out of his existence. Only one creature\nstill existed: the man who was dead. For many weeks he strove to bring\nhim to life again: he used to talk to him, write to him:\n",
                "\"My dear, I had no letter from you to-day. Where are you? Come back,\ncome back, speak to me, write to me!...\"\n",
                "But at night, hard though he tried, he could never succeed in seeing him\nin his dreams. We rarely dream of those we have lost, while their loss\nis still a pain. They come back to us later on when we are beginning to\nforget.\n",
                "However, the outside world began gradually to penetrate to the sepulcher\nof Christophe's soul. At first he became dimly conscious of the\ndifferent noises in the house and to take an unwitting interest in them.\nHe marked the time of day when the front door opened and shut, and how\noften during the day, and the different ways in which it was opened for\nthe various visitors. He knew Braun's step: he used to visualize the\ndoctor coming back from his rounds, stopping in the hall, hanging up his\nhat and cloak, always with the same meticulous fussy way. And when the\naccustomed noises came up to him out of the order in which he had come\nto look for them, he could not help trying to discover the reason for\nthe change. At meals he began mechanically to listen to the\nconversation. He saw that Braun almost always talked single-handed. His\nwife used only to give him a curt reply. Braun was never put out by the\nwant of anybody to talk to: he used to chat pleasantly and verbosely\nabout the houses he had visited and the gossip he had picked up. At\nlast, one day, Christophe looked at Braun while he was speaking: Braun\nwas delighted, and laid himself out to keep him interested.\n",
                "Christophe tried to pick up the threads of life again.... It was utterly\nexhausting! He felt old, as old as the world!... In the morning when he\ngot up and saw himself in the mirror he was disgusted with his body, his\ngestures, his idiotic figure. Get up, dress, to what end?... He tried\ndesperately to work: it made him sick. What was the good of creation,\nwhen everything ends in nothing? Music had become impossible for him.\nArt--(and everything else)--can only be rightly judged in unhappiness.\nUnhappiness is the touchstone. Only then do we know those who can stride\nacross the ages, those who are stronger than death. Very few bear the\ntest. In unhappiness we are struck by the mediocrity of certain souls\nupon whom we had counted--(and of the artists we had loved, who had been\nlike friends to our lives).--Who survives? How hollow does the beauty of\nthe world ring under the touch of sorrow!\n",
                "But sorrow grows weary, the force goes from its grip. Christophe's\nnerves were relaxed. He slept, slept unceasingly. It seemed that he\nwould never succeed in satisfying his hunger for sleep.\n",
                "At last one night he slept so profoundly that he did not wake up until\nwell on into the afternoon of the next day. The house was empty. Braun\nand his wife had gone out. The window was open, and the smiling air was\nquivering with light. Christophe felt that a crushing weight had been\nlifted from him. He got up and went down into the garden. It was a\nnarrow rectangle, inclosed within high walls, like those of a convent.\nThere were gravel paths between grass-plots and humble flowers; and an\narbor of grape-vines and climbing roses. A tiny fountain trickled from a\ngrotto built of stones: an acacia against the wall hung its\nsweet-scented branches over the next garden. Above stood the old tower\nof the church, of red sandstone. It was four o'clock in the evening. The\ngarden was already in shadow. The sun was still shining on the top of\nthe tree and the red belfry. Christophe sat in the arbor, with his back\nto the wall, and his head thrown back, looking at the limpid sky through\nthe interlacing tendrils of the vine and the roses. It was like waking\nfrom a nightmare. Everywhere was stillness and silence. Above his head\nnodded a cluster of roses languorously. Suddenly the most lovely rose of\nall shed its petals and died: the snow of the rose-leaves was scattered\non the air. It was like the passing of a lovely innocent life. So\nsimply!... In Christophe's mind it took on a significance of a rending\nsweetness. He choked: he hid his face in his hands, and sobbed....\n",
                "The bells in the church tower rang out. From one church to another\ncalled answering voices.... Christophe lost all consciousness of the\npassage of time. When he raised his head, the bells were silent and the\nsun had disappeared. Christophe was comforted by his tears: they had\nwashed away the stains from his mind. Within himself he heard a little\nstream of music well forth and he saw the little crescent moon glide\ninto the evening sky. He was called to himself by the sound of footsteps\nentering the house. He went up to his room, locked the door, and let the\nfountain of music gush forth. Braun summoned him to dinner, knocked at\nthe door, and tried to open it: Christophe made no reply. Anxiously\nBraun looked through the keyhole and was reassured when he saw\nChristophe lying half over the table surrounded with paper which he was\nblackening with ink.\n",
                "A few hours later, worn out, Christophe went downstairs and found the\ndoctor reading, impatiently waiting for him in the drawing-room. He\nembraced the little man, asked him to forgive him for his strange\nconduct since his arrival, and, without waiting to be asked, he began to\ntell Braun about the dramatic events of the past weeks. It was the only\ntime he ever talked to him about it: he was never sure that Braun had\nunderstood him, for he talked disconnectedly, and it was very late, and,\nin spite of his eager interest, Braun was nearly dead with sleep. At\nlast--(the clock struck two)--Christophe saw it and they said\ngood-night.\n",
                "From that time on Christophe's existence was reconstituted. He did not\nmaintain his condition of transitory excitement: he came back to his\nsorrow, but it was normal sorrow which did not interfere with his life.\nHe could not help returning to life! Though he had just lost his dearest\nfriend in the world, though his grief had undermined him and Death had\nbeen his most intimate companion, there was in him such an abundant,\nsuch a tyrannical force of life, that it burst forth even in his\nelegies, shining forth from his eyes, his lips, his gestures. But a\ngnawing canker had crept into the heart of his force. Christophe had\nfits of despair, transports rather. He would be quite calm, trying to\nread, or walking: suddenly he would see Olivier's smile, his tired,\ngentle face.... It would tug at his heart.... He would falter, lay his\nhand on his breast, and moan. One day he was at the piano playing a\npassage from Beethoven with his old zest.... Suddenly he stopped, flung\nhimself on the ground, buried his face in the cushions of a chair, and\ncried:\n",
                "\"My boy....\"\n",
                "Worst of all was the sensation of having \"already lived\" that was\nconstantly with him. He was continually coming across familiar gestures,\nfamiliar words, the perpetual recurrence of the same experiences. He\nknew everything, had foreseen everything. One face would remind him of a\nface he had known and the lips would say--(as he was quite sure they\nwould)--exactly the same things as he had heard from the original:\nbeings similar to each other would pass through similar phases, knock up\nagainst the same obstacles, suffer from them in exactly the same way. If\nit is true that \"nothing so much brings weariness of life as the new\nbeginning of love,\" how much more then the new beginning of everything!\nIt was elusive and delusive.--Christophe tried not to think of it, since\nit was necessary to do so, if he were to live, and since he wished to\nlive. It is the saddest hypocrisy, such rejection of self-knowledge, in\nshame or piety, it is the invincible imperative need of living hiding\naway from itself! Knowing that no consolation is possible, a man invents\nconsolations. Being convinced that life has no reason, he forges reasons\nfor living. He persuades himself that he must live, even when no one\noutside himself is concerned. If need be he will go so far as to pretend\nthat the dead man encourages him to live. And he knows that he is\nputting into the dead man's mouth the words that he wishes him to say. O\nmisery!...\n",
                "Christophe set out on the road once more: his step seemed to have\nregained its old assurance: the gates of his heart were closed upon his\nsorrow: he never spoke of it to others: he avoided being left alone with\nit himself: outwardly he seemed calm.\n",
                "\"_Real sorrows_,\" says Balzac, \"_are apparently at peace in the deep bed\nthat they have made for themselves, where they seem to sleep, though all\nthe while they never cease to fret and eat away the soul_.\"\n",
                "Any one knowing Christophe and watching him closely, seeing him coming\nand going, talking, composing, even laughing--(he could laugh\nnow!)--would have felt that for all his vigor and the radiance of life\nin his eyes, something had been destroyed in him, in the inmost depths\nof his life.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "As soon as he had regained his hold on life he had to look about him for\na means of living. There could be no question of his leaving the town.\nSwitzerland was the safest shelter for him: and where else could he have\nfound more devoted hospitality?--But his pride could not suffer the idea\nof his being any further a burden upon his friend. In spite of Braun's\nprotestations, and his refusal to accept any payment, he could not rest\nuntil he had found enough pupils to permit of his paying his hosts for\nhis board and lodging. It was not an easy matter. The story of his\nrevolutionary escapade had been widely circulated: and the worthy\nfamilies of the place were reluctant to admit a man who was regarded as\ndangerous, or at any rate extraordinary, and, in consequence, not quite\n\"respectable,\" to their midst. However, his fame as a musician and\nBraun's good offices gained him access to four or five of the less\ntimorous or more curious families, who were perhaps artistically\nsnobbish enough to desire to gain particularity. They were none the less\ncareful to keep an eye on him, and to maintain a respectable distance\nbetween master and pupils.\n",
                "The Braun household fell into a methodically ordered existence. In the\nmorning each member of it went about his business: the doctor on his\nrounds, Christophe to his pupils, Madame Braun to the market and about\nher charitable works. Christophe used to return about one, a little\nbefore Braun, who would not allow them to wait for him; and he used to\nsit down to dinner alone with the wife. He did not like that at all: for\nshe was not sympathetic to him, and he could never find anything to say\nto her. She took no trouble to remove his impression, though it was\nimpossible for her not to be aware of it; she never bothered to put\nherself out in dress or in mind to please him: she never spoke to\nChristophe first: her notable lack of charm in movement and dress, her\nawkwardness, her coldness, would have repelled any man who was as\nsensitive as Christophe to the charm of women. When he remembered the\nsparkling elegance of the Parisian women, he could not help thinking, as\nhe looked at Anna:\n",
                "\"How ugly she is!\"\n",
                "Yet that was unjust: and he was not slow to notice the beauty of her\nhair, her hands, her mouth, her eyes,--on the rare occasions when he\nchanced to meet her gaze, which she always averted at once. But his\nopinion was never modified. As a matter of politeness he forced himself\nto speak to her: he labored to find subjects of conversation: she never\ngave him the smallest assistance. Several times he tried to ask her\nabout the town, her husband, herself: he could get nothing out of her.\nShe would make the most trivial answers: she would make an effort to\nsmile: but the effort was painfully evident; her smile was forced, her\nvoice was hollow: she drawled and dragged every word: her every sentence\nwas followed by a painful silence. At last Christophe only spoke to her\nas little as possible; and she was grateful to him for it. It was a\ngreat relief to both of them when the doctor came in. He was always in a\ngood humor, talkative, busy, vulgar, worthy. He ate, drank, talked,\nlaughed, plentifully. Anna used to talk to him a little: but they hardly\never touched on anything but the food in front of them or the price of\nthings. Sometimes Braun would jokingly tease her about her pious works\nand the minister's sermons. Then she would stiffen herself, and relapse\ninto an offended silence until the end of the meal. More often the\ndoctor would talk about his patients: he would delight in describing\nrepulsive cases, with a pleasant elaboration of detail which used to\nexasperate Christophe. Then he would throw his napkin on the table and\nget up, making faces of disgust which simply delighted the teller. Braun\nwould stop at once, and soothe his friend and laugh. At the next meal he\nwould begin again. His hospital pleasantries seemed to have the power to\nenliven the impassive Anna. She would break her silence with a sudden\nnervous laugh, which was something animal in quality. Perhaps she felt\nno less disgust than Christophe at the things that made her laugh.\n",
                "In the afternoon Christophe had very few pupils. Then, as a rule, he\nwould stay at home with Anna, while the doctor went out. They never saw\neach other. They used to go about their separate business. At first\nBraun had begged Christophe to give his wife a few lessons on the piano:\nshe was, he said, an excellent musician. Christophe asked Anna to play\nhim something. She did not need to be pressed, although she disliked\ndoing it: but she did it with her usual ungraciousness: she played\nmechanically, with an incredible lack of sensibility: each note was like\nanother: there was no sort of rhythm or expression: when she had to turn\nthe page she stopped short in the middle of a bar, made no haste about\nit, and went on with the next note. Christophe was so exasperated by it\nthat he was hard put to it to keep himself from making an insulting\nremark: he could not help going out of the room before she had finished.\nShe was not put out, but went on imperturbably to the very last note,\nand seemed to be neither hurt nor indignant at his rudeness: she hardly\nseemed to have noticed it. But the matter of music was never again\nmentioned between them. Sometimes in the afternoons when Christophe was\nout and returned unexpectedly, he would find Anna practising the piano,\nwith icy, dull tenacity, going over and over one passage fifty times,\nand never by any chance showing the least animation. She never played when\nshe knew that Christophe was at home. She devoted all the time that\nwas not consecrated to her religious duties to her household work. She\nused to sew, and mend, and darn, and look after the servant: she had a\nmania for tidiness and cleanliness. Her husband thought her a fine\nwoman, a little odd--\"like all women,\" he used to say--but \"like all\nwomen,\" devoted. On that last point Christophe made certain reservations\n_in petto_: such psychology seemed to him too simple; but he told\nhimself that, after all, it was Braun's affair; and he gave no further\nthought to the matter.\n",
                "They used to sit together after dinner in the evening. Braun and\nChristophe would talk. Anna would sit working. On Braun's entreaty,\nChristophe had consented to play the piano sometimes: and he would\noccasionally play on to a very late hour in the big gloomy room looking\nout on to the garden. Braun would go into ecstasies.... Who is there\nthat does not know the type that has a passionate love for things they\ndo not understand, or understand all wrong!--(which is why they love\nthem!)--Christophe did not mind: he had met so many idiots in the course\nof his life! But when Braun gave vent to certain mawkish expressions of\nenthusiasm, he would stop playing, and go up to his room without a word.\nBraun grasped the truth at last, and put a stopper on his reflections.\nBesides, his love for music was quickly sated: he could never listen\nwith any attention for more than a quarter of an hour on end: he would\npick up his paper, or doze off, and leave Christophe in peace. Anna\nwould sit back in her chair and say nothing: she would have her work in\nher lap and seem to be working: but her eyes were always staring and her\nhands never moved. Sometimes she would go out without a sound in the\nmiddle of a piece, and be seen no more.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "So the days passed. Christophe regained his strength. Braun's heavy but\nkindly attentions, the tranquillity of the household, the restful\nregularity of such a domestic life, the extremely nourishing German\nfood, restored him to his old robustness. His physical health was\nrepaired: but his moral machinery was still out of gear. His new vigor\nonly served to accentuate the disorder of his mind, which could not\nrecover its balance, like a badly ballasted ship which will turn turtle\non the smallest shock.\n",
                "He was profoundly lonely. He could have no intellectual intimacy with\nBraun. His relations with Anna were reduced, with a few exceptions, to\nsaying good-morning and good-night. His dealings with his pupils were\nrather hostile than otherwise: for he hardly hid from them his opinion\nthat the best thing for them to do was to give up music altogether. He\nknew nobody. It was not only his fault, though he had hidden himself\naway since his loss. People held aloof from him.\n",
                "He was living in an old town, full of intelligence and vitality, but\nalso full of patrician pride, self-contained, and self-satisfied. There\nwas a bourgeois aristocracy with a taste for work and the higher\nculture, but narrow and pietistic, who were calmly convinced of their\nown superiority and the superiority of their city, and quite content to\nlive in family isolation. There were enormous families with vast\nramifications. Each family had its day for a general gathering of the\nclan. They were hardly at all open to the outside world. All these great\nhouses, with fortunes generations old, felt no need of showing their\nwealth. They knew each other, and that was enough: the opinion of others\nwas a thing of no consequence. There were millionaires dressed like\nhumble shopkeepers, talking their raucous dialect with its pungent\nexpressions, going conscientiously to their offices, every day of their\nlives, even at an age when the most industrious of men will grant\nthemselves the right to rest. Their wives prided themselves on their\ndomestic skill. No dowry was given to the daughters. Rich men let their\nsons in their turn go through the same hard apprenticeship that they\nthemselves had served. They practised strict economy in their daily\nlives. But they made a noble use of their fortune in collecting works of\nart, picture galleries, and in social work: they were forever giving\nenormous sums, nearly always anonymously, to found charities and to\nenrich the museums. They were a mixture of greatness and absurdity, both\nof another age. This little world, for which the rest of the world\nseemed not to exist--(although its members knew it thoroughly through\ntheir business, and their distant relationships, and the long and\nextended voyages which they forced their sons to take,)--this little\nworld, for which fame and celebrity in another land only were esteemed\nfrom the moment when they were welcomed and recognized by\nitself,--practised the severest discipline upon itself. Every member of\nit kept a watch upon himself and upon the rest. The result of all this\nwas a collective conscience which masked all individual differences\n(more marked than elsewhere among the robust personalities of the place)\nunder the veil of religious and moral uniformity. Everybody practised\nit, everybody believed in it. Not a single soul doubted it or would\nadmit of doubt. It were impossible to know what took place in the depths\nof souls which were the more hermetically sealed against prying eyes\ninasmuch as they knew that they were surrounded by a narrow scrutiny,\nand that every man took upon himself the right to examine into the\nconscience of other men. It was said that even those who had left the\ncountry and thought themselves emancipated--as soon as they set foot in\nit again were dominated by the traditions, the habits, the atmosphere of\nthe town: even the most skeptical were at once forced to practise and to\nbelieve. Not to believe would have seemed to them an offense against\nNature. Not to believe was the mark of an inferior caste, a sign of bad\nbreeding. It was never admitted that a man of their world could possibly\nbe absolved of his religious duties. If a man did not practise their\nreligion, he was at once unclassed, and all doors were closed to him.\n",
                "Even the weight of such discipline was apparently not enough for them.\nThe men of this little world were not closely bound enough within their\ncaste. Within the great _Verein_ they had formed a number of smaller\n_Verein_ by way of binding their fetters fast. There were several hundred\nof them: and they were increasing every year. There were _Verein_ for\neverything: for philanthropy, charitable work, commercial work, work that\nwas both charitable and commercial, for the arts, for the sciences, for\nsinging, music, spiritual exercises, physical exercises, merely to provide\nexcuses for meeting and taking their amusement collectively: there were\n_Verein_ for the various districts and the various corporations: there\nwere _Verein_ for men of the same position in the world, the same degree\nof wealth, men of the same social weight, who wore the same handle to\ntheir names. It was even said that an attempt had been made to form a\n_Verein_ for the _Vereinlosen_ (those who did not belong to any _Verein_):\nthough not twelve such people had been forthcoming.\n",
                "Within this triple bandage of town, caste, and union, the soul was\ncramped and bound. Character was suppressed by a secret constraint. The\nmajority were brought up to it from childhood--had been for centuries:\nand they found it good: they would have thought it improper and\nunhealthy to go without these bandages. Their satisfied smiles gave no\nindication of the discomfort they might be feeling. But Nature always\ntook her revenge. Every now and then there would arise some individual\nin revolt, some vigorous artist or unbridled thinker who would brutally\nbreak his bonds and set the city fathers by the ears. They were so\nclever that, if the rebel had not been stifled in the embryo, and became\nthe stronger, they never troubled to fight him--(a fight might have\nproduced all sorts of scandalous outbreaks):--they bought him up. If he\nwere a painter, they sent him to the museum: if he were a thinker, to\nthe libraries. It was quite useless for him to roar out all sorts of\noutrageous things: they pretended not to hear him. It was in vain for\nhim to protest his independence: they incorporated him as one of\nthemselves. So the effect of the poison was neutralized: it was the\nhomeopathic treatment.--But such cases were rare, most of the rebellions\nnever reached the light of day. Their peaceful houses concealed\nunsuspected tragedies. The master of a great house would go quietly and\nthrow himself into the river, and leave no explanation. Sometimes a man\nwould go into retirement for six months, sometimes he would send his\nwife to an asylum to restore her mind. Such things were spoken of quite\nopenly, as though they were quite natural, with that placidity which is\none of the great features of the town, the inhabitants of which are able\nto maintain it in the face of suffering and death.\n",
                "These solid burgesses, who were hard upon themselves because they knew\ntheir own worth, were much less hard on others because they esteemed\nthem less. They were quite liberal towards the foreigners dwelling in\nthe town like Christophe, German professors, and political refugees,\nbecause they had no sort of feeling about them. And, besides, they loved\nintelligence. Advanced ideas had no terrors for them: they knew that\ntheir sons were impervious to their influence. They were coldly cordial\nto their guests, and kept them at a distance.\n",
                "Christophe did not need to have these things underlined. He was in a\nstate of raw sensitiveness which left his feelings absolutely\nunprotected: he was only too ready to see egoism and indifference\neverywhere, and to withdraw into himself.\n",
                "To make matters worse, Braun's patients, and the very limited circle to\nwhich his wife belonged, all moved in a little Protestant society which\nwas particularly strict. Christophe was ill-regarded by them both as a\nPapist by origin and a heretic in fact. For his part, he found many\nthings which shocked him. Although he no longer believed, yet he bore\nthe marks of his inherited Catholicism, which was more poetic than a\nmatter of reason, more indulgent towards Nature, and never suffered the\nself-torment of trying to explain and understand what to love and what\nnot to love: and also he had the habits of intellectual and moral\nfreedom which he had unwittingly come by in Paris. It was inevitable\nthat he should come into collision with the little pious groups of\npeople in whom all the defects of the Calvinistic spirit were marked and\nexaggerated: a rationalistic religion, which clipped the wings of faith\nand left it dangling over the abyss: for it started with an _a\npriori_ reason which was open to discussion like all mysticism: it\nwas no longer poetry, nor was it prose, it was poetry translated into\nprose. They had pride of intellect, an absolute, dangerous faith in\nreason--in _their_ reason. They could not believe in God or in\nimmortality: but they believed in reason as a Catholic believes in the\nPope, or as a fetish-worshiper believes in his idol. They never even\ndreamed of discussing the matter. In vain did life contradict it; they\nwould rather have denied life. They had no psychology, no understanding\nof Nature, or of the hidden forces, the roots of humanity, the \"Spirit\nof the Earth.\" They fashioned a scheme of life and nature that were\nchildish, silly, arbitrary figments. Some of them were cultured and\npractical people who had seen and read much. But they never saw or read\nanything as it actually was: they always reduced it to an abstraction.\nThey were poor-blooded: they had high moral qualities: but they were not\nhuman enough: and that is the cardinal sin. Their purity of heart, which\nwas often very real, noble, and naive, sometimes comic, unfortunately,\nin certain cases, became tragic: it made them hard in their dealings\nwith others, and produced in them a tranquil inhumanity, self-confident\nand free from anger, which was quite appalling. How should they\nhesitate? Had they not truth, right, virtue, on their side? Did they not\nreceive revelation direct from their hallowed reason? Reason is a hard\nsun: it gives light, but it blinds. In that withering light, without\nshade or mist, human beings grow pallid, the blood is sucked up from\ntheir hearts.\n",
                "Now, if there was one thing in the world that was utterly meaningless to\nChristophe at that time it was reason. To his eyes its sun only lit up\nthe walls of the abyss, and neither showed him the means of escape nor\neven enabled him to sound its depths.\n",
                "As for the artistic world, Christophe had little opportunity and less\ndesire to mix with it. The musicians were for the most part worthy\nconservatives of the neo-Schumann period and \"Brahmins\" of the type\nagainst which Christophe had formerly broken many a lance. There were\ntwo exceptions: Krebs, the organist, who kept a famous confectioner's\nshop, an honest man and a good musician, who would have been an even\nbetter one if, to adapt the quip of one of his fellow-countrymen, \"he\nhad not been seated on a Pegasus which he overfed with hay,\"--and a\nyoung Jewish composer of an original talent, a man full of a vigorous\nand turbid sap, who had a business in the Swiss trade: wood carvings,\nchalets, and Berne bears. They were more independent than the others, no\ndoubt because they did not make a trade of their art, and they would\nhave been very glad to come in touch with Christophe: and at any other\ntime Christophe would have been interested to know them: but at this\nperiod of his life, all artistic and human curiosity was blunted in him:\nhe was more conscious of the division between himself and other men than\nof the bond of union.\n",
                "His only friend, the confidant of his thoughts, was the river that ran\nthrough the city--the same mighty fatherly river that washed the walls\nof his native town up north. In the river Christophe could recover the\nmemory of his childish dreams.... But in his sorrow they took on, like\nthe Rhine itself, a darkling hue. In the dying day he would lean against\nthe parapet of the embankment and look down at the rushing river, the\nfused and fusing, heavy, opaque, and hurrying mass, which was always\nlike a dream of the past, wherein nothing could be clearly seen but\ngreat moving veils, thousands of streams, currents, eddies twisting into\nform, then fading away: it was like the blurred procession of mental\nimages in a fevered mind: forever taking shape, forever melting away.\nOver this twilight dream there skimmed phantom ferry-boats, like\ncoffins, with never a human form in them. Darker grew the night. The\nriver became bronze. The lights upon its banks made its armor shine with\nan inky blackness, casting dim reflections, the coppery reflections of\nthe gas lamps, the moon-like reflections of the electric lights, the\nblood-red reflections of the candles in the windows of the houses. The\nriver's murmur filled the darkness with its eternal muttering that was\nfar more sad than the monotony of the sea....\n",
                "For hours together Christophe would stand drinking in the song of death\nand weariness of life. Only with difficulty could he tear himself away:\nthen he would climb up to the house again, up the steep alleys with\ntheir red steps, which were worn away in the middle: broken in soul and\nbody he would cling to the iron hand-rail fastened to the walls, which\ngleamed under the light thrown down from the empty square on the hilltop\nin front of the church that was shrouded in darkness....\n",
                "He could not understand why men went on living. When he remembered the\nstruggles he had seen, he felt a bitter admiration for the undying faith\nof humanity. Ideas succeeded the ideas most directly opposed to them,\nreaction followed action:--democracy, aristocracy: socialism,\nindividualism: romanticism, classicism: progress, tradition:--and so on\nto the end of time. Each new generation, consumed in its own heat in\nless than ten years, believed steadfastly that it alone had reached the\nzenith, and hurled its predecessors down and stoned them: each new\ngeneration bestirred itself, and shouted, and took to itself the power\nand the glory, only to be hurled down and stoned in turn by its\nsuccessors and so to disappear. Whose turn next?...\n",
                "The composition of music was no longer a refuge for Christophe: it was\nintermittent, irregular, aimless. Write? For whom? For men? He was\npassing through an acute phase of misanthropy. For himself? He was only\ntoo conscious of the vanity of art with its impotence to top the void of\ndeath. Only now and then the blind force that was in him would raise him\non its mighty beating wing and then fall back, worn out by the effort.\nHe was like a storm cloud rumbling in the darkness. With Olivier gone,\nhe had nothing left. He hurled himself against everything that had\nfilled his life, against the feelings that he had thought to share with\nothers, against the thoughts which he had in imagination had in common\nwith the rest of humanity. It seemed to him now that he had been the\nplaything of an illusion: the whole life of society was based upon a\ncolossal misunderstanding originating in speech. We imagine that one\nman's thought can communicate with the thought of other men. In reality\nthe connection lies only in words. We say and hear words: not one word\nhas the same meaning in the mouths of two different men. Words outrun\nthe reality of life. We speak of love and hatred. There is neither love\nnor hatred, friends nor enemies, no faith, no passion, neither good nor\nevil. There are only cold reflections of the lights falling from\nvanished suns, stars that have been dead for ages.... Friends? There is\nno lack of people to claim that name. But what a stale reality is\nrepresented by their friendship! What is friendship in the sense of the\neveryday world? How many minutes of his life does he who thinks himself\na friend give to the pale memory of his friend? What would he sacrifice\nto him, not of the things that are necessary, but of his superfluity,\nhis leisure, his waste time? What had Christophe sacrificed for\nOlivier?--(For he made no exception in his own case: he excepted only\nOlivier from the state of nothingness into which he cast all human\nbeings).--Art is no more true than love. What room does it really occupy\nin life? With what sort of love do they love it, they who declare their\ndevotion to it?... The poverty of human feeling is inconceivable.\nOutside the instincts of species, the cosmic force which is the lever of\nthe world, nothing exists save a scattered dust of emotion. The majority\nof men have not vitality enough to give themselves wholly to any\npassion. They spare themselves and save their force with cowardly\nprudence. They are a little of everything and nothing absolutely. A man\nwho gives himself without counting the cost, to everything that he does,\neverything that he suffers, everything that he loves, everything that he\nhates, is a prodigy, the greatest that is granted to us here on earth.\nPassion is like genius: a miracle, which is as much as to say that it\ndoes not exist.\n",
                "So thought Christophe: and life was on the verge of giving him the lie\nin a terrible fashion. The miracle is everywhere, like fire in stone:\nfriction brings it forth. We have little notion of the demons who lie\nslumbering within ourselves....\n",
                "  ... _Pero non mi destar, deh! parla basso!_...\n",
                "One evening when he was improvising at the piano, Anna got up and went\nout, as she often did when Christophe was playing. Apparently his music\nbored her. Christophe had ceased to notice it: he was indifferent to\nanything she might think. He went on playing: then he had an idea which\nhe wished to write down, and stopped short and hurried up to his room\nfor the necessary paper. As he opened the door into the next room and,\nwith head down, rushed into the darkness, he bumped violently against a\nfigure standing motionless just inside. Anna.... The shock and the\nsurprise made her cry out. Christophe was anxious to know if he had hurt\nher, and took her hands in his. Her hands were frozen. She seemed to\nshiver,--no doubt from the shock. She muttered a vague explanation of\nher presence there:\n",
                "\"I was looking in the dining-room....\"\n",
                "He did not hear what she was looking for: and perhaps she did not say\nwhat it was. It seemed to him odd that she should go about looking for\nsomething without a light. But he was used to Anna's singular ways and\npaid no attention to it. An hour later he returned to the little parlor\nwhere he used to spend the evening with Braun and Anna. He sat at the\ntable near the lamp, writing. Anna was on his right at the table,\nsewing, with her head bent over her work. Behind them, in an armchair,\nnear the fire, Braun was reading a magazine. They were all three silent.\nAt intervals they could hear the pattering of the rain on the gravel in\nthe garden. To get away from her Christophe sat with his back turned to\nAnna. Opposite him on the wall was a mirror which reflected the table,\nthe lamp, the two faces bending over their work. It seemed to Christophe\nthat Anna was looking at him. At first he did not pay much attention to\nit; then, as he could not shake off the idea, he began to feel uneasy\nand he looked up at the mirror and saw.... She was looking at him. And\nin such a way! He was petrified with amazement, held his breath, watched\nher. She did not know that he was watching her. The light of the lamp\nwas cast upon her pale face, the silent solemnity of which seemed now to\nbe fiercely concentrated. Her eyes--those strange eyes that he had never\nbeen able squarely to see--were fixed upon him: they were dark blue,\nwith large pupils, and the expression in them was burning and hard: they\nwere fastened upon him, searching through him with dumb insistent ardor.\nHer eyes? Could they be her eyes? He saw them and could not believe it.\nDid he really see them? He turned suddenly.... Her eyes were lowered. He\ntried to talk to her, to force her to look up at him. Impassively she\nreplied without raising her eyes from her work or from their refuge\nbehind the impenetrable shadow of her bluish eyelids with their short\nthick lashes. If Christophe had not been quite positive of what he had\nseen, he would have believed that he had been the victim of an illusion.\nBut he knew what he had seen, and he could not explain it away.\n",
                "However, as his mind was engrossed in his work and he found Anna very\nuninteresting, the strange impression made on him did not occupy him for\nlong.\n",
                "A week later Christophe was trying over a song he had just composed, on\nthe piano. Braun, who had a mania, due partly to marital vanity and\npartly to love of teasing, for worrying his wife to sing and play, had\nbeen particularly insistent that evening. As a rule Anna only replied\nwith a curt \"No\"; after which she would not even trouble to reply to his\nrequests, entreaties, and pleasantries: she would press her lips\ntogether and seem not to hear. On this occasion, to Braun's and\nChristophe's astonishment, she folded up her work, got up, and went to\nthe piano. She sang the song which she had never even read. It was a\nsort of miracle:--_the_ miracle. The deep tones of her voice bore\nnot the faintest resemblance to the rather raucous and husky voice in\nwhich she spoke. With absolute sureness from the very first note,\nwithout a shade of difficulty, without the smallest effort, she endued\nthe melody with a grandeur that was both moving and pure: and she rose\nto an intensity of passion which made Christophe shiver: for it seemed\nto him to be the very voice of his own heart. He looked at her in\namazement while she was singing, and at last, for the first time, he saw\nher as she was. He saw her dark eyes in which there was kindled a light\nof wildness, he saw her wide, passionate mouth with its clear-cut lips,\nthe voluptuous, rather heavy and cruel smile, her strong white teeth,\nher beautiful strong hands, one of which was laid on the rack of the\npiano, and the sturdy frame of her body cramped by her clothes,\nemaciated by a life of economy and poverty, though it was easy to divine\nthe youth, the vigor, and the harmony, that were concealed by her gown.\n",
                "She stopped singing, and went and sat down with her hands folded in her\nlap. Braun complimented her: but to his way of thinking there had been a\nlack of softness in her singing. Christophe said nothing. He sat\nwatching her. She smiled vaguely, knowing that he was looking at her.\nAll the evening there was a complete silence between them. She knew\nquite well that she had risen above herself, or rather, that she had\nbeen \"herself,\" for the first time. And she could not understand why.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "From that day on Christophe began to observe Anna closely. She had\nrelapsed into her sullenness, her cold indifference, and her mania for\nwork, which exasperated even her husband, while beneath it all she\nlulled the obscure thoughts of her troubled nature. It was in vain that\nChristophe watched her, he never found her anything but the stiff\nordinary woman of their first acquaintance. Sometimes she would sit lost\nin thought, doing nothing, with her eyes staring straight in front of\nher. They would leave her so, and come back a quarter of an hour later\nand find her just the same: she would never stir. When her husband asked\nher what she was thinking of, she would rouse herself from her torpor\nand smile and say that she was thinking of nothing. And she spoke the\ntruth.\n",
                "There was nothing capable of upsetting her equanimity. One day when she\nwas dressing, her spirit-lamp burst. In an instant Anna was a mass of\nflames. The maid rushed away screaming for help. Braun lost his head,\nflung himself about, shouted and yelled, and almost fell ill. Anna tore\naway the hooks of her dressing-gown, slipped off her skirt just as it\nwas beginning to burn, and stamped on it. When Christophe ran in\nexcitedly with a water-bottle which he had blindly seized, he found Anna\nstanding on a chair, in her petticoat with her arms bare, calmly putting\nout the burning curtains with her hands. She got burnt, said nothing\nabout it, and only seemed to be put out at being seen in such a costume.\nShe blushed, awkwardly covered her shoulders with her arms, and with an\nair of offended dignity ran away into the next room. Christophe admired\nher calmness: but he could not tell whether it proved her courage or her\ninsensibility. He was inclined to the latter explanation. Indeed, Anna\nseemed to take no interest in anything, or in other people, or in\nherself. Christophe doubted even whether she had a heart.\n",
                "He had no doubt at all after a little scene which he happened to\nwitness. Anna had a little black dog, with intelligent soft eyes, which\nwas the spoiled darling of the household. Braun adored it. Christophe\nused to take it to his room when he shut himself up to work; and often,\nwhen the door was closed, instead of working, he would play with it.\nWhen he went out, the dog was always waiting for him at the door,\nlooking out for him, to follow at his heels: for he always wanted a\ncompanion in his walks. She would run in front of him, pattering along\nwith her little paws moving so fast that they seemed to fly. Every now\nand then she would stop in pride at walking faster than he: and she\nwould look at him and draw herself up archly. She used to beg, and bark\nfuriously at a piece of wood: but directly she saw another dog in the\ndistance she would tear away as fast as she could and tremblingly take\nrefuge between Christophe's legs. Christophe loved her and used to laugh\nat her. Since he had held aloof from men he had come nearer to the\nbrutes: he found them pitiful and touching. The poor beasts surrender\nwith such absolute confidence to those who are kind to them! Man is so\nmuch the master of their life and death that those who are cruel to the\nweak creatures delivered into their hands are guilty of an abominable\nabuse of power.\n",
                "Affectionate though the pretty creature was with every one, she had a\nmarked preference for Anna. She did nothing to attract the dog: but she\nliked to stroke her and let her snuggle down in her lap, and see that\nshe was fed, and she seemed to love her as much as she was capable of\nloving anything. One day the dog failed to get out of the way of a\nmotor-car. She was run over almost under the very eyes of her masters.\nShe was still alive and yelping pitiably. Braun ran out of the house\nbareheaded: he picked up the bleeding mass and tried to relieve the\ndog's suffering. Anna came up, looked down without so much as stooping,\nmade a face of disgust, and went away again. Braun watched the little\ncreature's agony with tears in his eyes. Christophe was striding up and\ndown the garden with clenched fists. He heard Anna quietly giving orders\nto the servant. He could not help crying out:\n",
                "\"It doesn't affect you at all?\"\n",
                "She replied:\n",
                "\"There's nothing to be done. It is better not to think of it.\"\n",
                "He felt that he hated her: then he was struck by the grotesqueness of\nher reply: and he laughed. He thought it would be well if Anna could\ngive him her recipe for avoiding the thought of sad things, and that\nlife must be very easy for those who are lucky enough to have no heart.\nHe fancied that if Braun were to die, Anna would hardly be put out by\nit, and he felt glad that he was not married. His solitude seemed less\nsad to him than the fetters of habit that bind a man for life to a\ncreature to whom he may be an object of hatred, or worse still, nothing\nat all. It was very certain that this woman loved no one. She hardly\nexisted. The atmosphere of piety had withered her.\n",
                "She took Christophe by surprise one day at the end of October.--They\nwere at dinner. He was talking to Braun about a crime of passion which\nwas the sole topic in the town. In the country two Italian girls,\nsisters, had fallen in love with the same man. They were both unable to\nmake the sacrifice with a good grace, and so they had drawn lots as to\nwho should yield. But when the lot was cast the girl who had lost showed\nlittle inclination to abide by the decision. The other was enraged by\nsuch faithlessness. From insult they came to blows, and even to fighting\nwith knives: then, suddenly, the wind changed: they kissed each other,\nand wept, and vowed that they could not live without each other: and, as\nthey could not submit to sharing the lover, they made up their minds\nthat he should be killed. This they did. One night the two girls invited\nthe lover to their room, and he was congratulating himself upon such\ntwofold favor; and, while one girl clasped him passionately in her arms,\nthe other no less passionately stabbed him in the back. It chanced that\nhis cries were heard. People came and tore him in a pitiable condition\nfrom the embraces of his charmers, and they were arrested. They\nprotested that it was no one's business, and that they alone were\ninterested in the matter, and that, from the moment when they had agreed\nto rid themselves of their own property, it was no one else's concern.\nTheir victim was not a little inclined to agree with their line of\nargument: but the law was unable to follow it. And Braun could not\nunderstand it either.\n",
                "\"They are mad,\" he said. \"They should be shut up in an asylum.\nBeasts!... I can understand a man killing himself for love. I can even\nunderstand a man killing the woman he loves if she deceives him.... I\ndon't mean that I would excuse his doing so: but I am prepared to admit\nthat there is a remnant of primitive savagery in us: it is barbarous,\nbut it is logical: you kill the person who makes you suffer. But for a\nwoman to kill the man she loves, without bitterness, without hatred,\nsimply because another woman loves him, is nothing but madness.... Can\nyou understand it, Christophe?\"\n",
                "\"Peuh!\" said Christophe. \"I'm quite used to being unable to understand\nthings. Love is madness.\"\n",
                "Anna, who had said nothing, and seemed not to be listening, said in her\ncalm voice:\n",
                "\"There is nothing irrational in it. It is quite natural. When a woman\nloves, she wants to destroy the man she loves so that no one else may\nhave him.\"\n",
                "Braun looked at his wife aghast, thumped on the table, folded his arms,\nand said:\n",
                "\"Where on earth did you get that from?... What? So you must put your oar\nin, must you? What the devil do you know about it?\"\n",
                "Anna blushed a little, and said no more. Braun went on:\n",
                "\"When a woman loves, she wants to destroy, does she? That's a nice sort\nof thing to say! To destroy any one who is dear to you is to destroy\nyourself.--On the contrary, when one loves, the natural feeling is to do\ngood to the person you love, to cherish him, to defend him, to be kind\nto him, to be kind to everything and everybody. Love is paradise on\nearth.\"\n",
                "Anna sat staring into the darkness, and let him talk, and then shook her\nhead, and said coldly:\n",
                "\"A woman is not kind when she loves.\"\n",
                "Christophe did not renew the experiment of hearing Anna sing. He was\nafraid ... of disillusion, or what? He could not tell. Anna was just as\nfearful. She would never stay in the room when he began to play.\n",
                "But one evening in November, as he was reading by the fire, he saw Anna\nsitting with her sewing in her lap, deep in one of her reveries. She was\nlooking blankly in front of her, and Christophe thought he saw in her\neyes the strangely burning light of the other evening. He closed his\nbook. She felt his eyes upon her, and picked up her sewing. With her\neyelids down she saw everything. He got up and said:\n",
                "\"Come.\"\n",
                "She stared at him, and there was still a little uneasiness in her eyes:\nshe understood, and followed him.\n",
                "\"Where are you going?\" asked Braun.\n",
                "\"To the piano,\" replied Christophe.\n",
                "He played. She sang. At once he found her just as she had been on the\nfirst occasion. She entered the heroic world of music as a matter of\ncourse, as though it were her own. He tested her yet further, and went\non to a second song, then to a third, more passionate, which let loose\nin her the whole gamut of passion, uplifting both herself and him: then,\nas they reached a very paroxysm, he stopped short and asked her, staring\nstraight into her eyes:\n",
                "\"Tell me, what woman are you?\"\n",
                "Anna replied:\n",
                "\"I do not know.\"\n",
                "He said brutally:\n",
                "\"What is there in you that makes you sing like that?\"\n",
                "She replied:\n",
                "\"Only what you put there to make me sing.\"\n",
                "\"Yes? Well, it is not out of place. I'm wondering whether I created it\nor you. How do you come to think of such things?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know. I think I am no longer myself when I am singing.\"\n",
                "\"I think it is only then that you are yourself.\"\n",
                "They said no more. Her cheeks were wet with a slight perspiration. Her\nbosom heaved, but she spoke no word. She stared at the lighted candles,\nand mechanically scratched away the wax that had trickled down the side\nof the candlestick. He drummed on the keys as he sat looking at her.\nThey exchanged a few awkward remarks, brusquely and roughly, and then\nthey tried a commonplace remark or two, and finally relapsed into\nsilence, being fearful of probing any farther....\n",
                "Next day they hardly spoke: they stole glances at each other in a sort\nof dread. But they made it a habit to play and sing together in the\nevening. Before long they began in the afternoon, giving a little more\ntime to it each day. Always the same incomprehensible passion would take\npossession of her with the very first bars, and set her flaming from\nhead to foot, and, while the music lasted, make of the ordinary little\nwoman an imperious Venus, the incarnation of all the furies of the soul.\nBraun was surprised at Anna's sudden craze for singing, but did not take\nthe trouble to discover any explanation for a mere feminine caprice: he\nwas often present at their little concerts, marked time with his head,\ngave his advice, and was perfectly happy, although he would have\npreferred softer, sweeter music: such an expenditure of energy seemed to\nhim exaggerated and unnecessary. Christophe breathed freely in the\natmosphere of danger: but he was losing his head: he was weakened by the\ncrisis through which he had passed, and could not resist, and lost\nconsciousness of what was happening to him without perceiving what was\nhappening to Anna. One afternoon, in the middle of a song, with all the\nfrantic ardor of it in full blast, she suddenly stopped, and left the\nroom without making any explanation. Christophe waited for her: she did\nnot return. Half an hour later, as he was going down the passage past\nAnna's room, through the half-open door he saw her absorbed in grim\nprayer, with all expression frozen from her face.\n",
                "However, a slight, very slight, feeling of confidence cropped up between\nthem. He tried to make her talk about her past: only with great\ndifficulty could he induce her to tell him a few commonplace details.\nThanks to Braun's easy, indiscreet good nature, he was able to gain a\nglimpse into her intimate life.\n",
                "She was a native of the town. Her maiden name was Anna Maria Senfl. Her\nfather, Martin Senfl, was a member of an old commercial house, very old\nand enormously rich, in whom pride of caste and religious strictness\nwere ingrained. Being of an adventurous temper, like many of his\nfellow-countrymen, he had spent several years abroad in the East and in\nSouth America: he had even made bold exploring expeditions in Central\nAsia, whither he had gone to advance the commercial interests of his\nhouse, for love of science, and for his own pleasure. By dint of rolling\nthrough the world, he had not only gathered no moss, but had also rid\nhimself of that which covered him, the moss of his old prejudices. When,\ntherefore, he returned to his own country, being of a warm temper and an\nobstinate mind, he married, in face of the indignant protests of his\nfamily, the daughter of a farmer of the surrounding country, a lady of\ndoubtful reputation who had originally been his mistress. Marriage had\nbeen the only available means of keeping the beautiful girl to himself,\nand he could not do without her. After having exercised its veto in\nvain, his family absolutely closed its doors to its erring member who\nhad set aside its sacrosanct authority. The town--all those, that is,\nwho mattered, who, as usual, were absolutely united in any matter that\ntouched the moral dignity of the community--sided bodily against the\nrash couple. The explorer learned to his cost that it is no less\ndangerous to traverse the prejudice of the people in a country inhabited by\nthe sectaries of Christ, than in a country inhabited by those of the\nGrand Lania. He had not been strong enough to live without public\nopinion. He had more than jeopardized his patrimony: he could find no\nemployment: everything was closed to him. He wore himself out in futile\nwrath against the affronts of the implacable town. His health,\nundermined by excess and fever, could not bear up against it. He died of\na flux of blood five months after his marriage. Four months later, his\nwife, a good creature, but weak and feather-brained, who had never lived\nthrough a day since her marriage without weeping, died in childbirth,\ncasting the infant Anna upon the shores which she was leaving.\n",
                "Martin's mother was alive. Even when they were dying she had not\nforgiven her son or the woman whom she had refused to acknowledge as her\ndaughter-in-law. But when the woman died--and Divine vengeance was\nappeased--she took the child and looked after her. She was a woman of\nthe narrowest piety: she was rich and mean, and kept a draper's shop in\na gloomy street in the old town. She treated her son's daughter less as\na grandchild than as an orphan taken in out of charity, and therefore\noccupying more or less the position of a servant by way of payment.\nHowever, she gave her a careful education; but she never departed from\nher attitude of suspicious strictness towards her; it seemed as though\nshe considered the child guilty of her parents' sin, and therefore set\nherself to chasten and chastise the sin in her. She never allowed her\nany amusement: she punished everything that was natural in her gestures,\nwords, thoughts, as a crime. She killed all joy in her young life. From\na very early age Anna was accustomed to being bored in church and\ndisguising the fact: she was hemmed in by the terrors of hell: every\nSunday the child's heavy-lidded eyes used to see them at the door of the\nold _M\u00fcnster_, in the shape of the immodest and distorted statues\nwith a fire burning between their legs, while round their loins crawled\ntoads and snakes. She became accustomed to suppressing her instincts and\nlying to herself. As soon as she was old enough to help her grandmother,\nshe was kept busy from morning to night in the dark gloomy shop. She\nassimilated the habits of those around her, the spirit of order, grim\neconomy, futile privations, the bored indifference, the contemptuous,\nungracious conception of life, which is the natural consequence of\nreligious beliefs in those who are not naturally religious. She was\nso wholly given up to her piety as to seem rather absurd even to the old\nwoman: she indulged in far too many fasts and macerations: at one period\nshe even went so far as to wear corsets embellished with pins, which\nstuck into her flesh with every movement. She was seen to go pale, but\nno one knew what was the matter. At last, when she fainted, a doctor was\ncalled in. She refused to allow him to examine her--(she would have died\nrather than undress in the presence of a man)--but she confessed: and\nthe doctor was so angry about it that she promised not to do it again.\nTo make quite sure her grandmother thereafter took to inspecting her\nclothes. In such self-torture Anna did not, as might have been supposed,\nfind any mystic pleasure: she had little imagination, she would never\nhave understood the poetry of saints like Francis of Assisi or Teresa.\nHer piety was sad and materialistic. When she tormented herself, it was\nnot in any hope of advantage to be gained in the next world, but came\nonly from a cruel boredom which rebounded against herself, so that she\nonly found in it an almost angry pleasure in hurting herself. Singularly\nenough, her hard, cold spirit was, like her grandmother's, open to the\ninfluence of music, though she never knew how profound that influence\nwas. She was impervious to all the other arts: probably she had never\nlooked at a picture in her life: she seemed to have no sense of plastic\nbeauty, for she was lacking in taste, owing to her proud and wilful\nindifference; the idea of a beautiful body only awoke in her the idea of\nnakedness, that is to say, like the peasant of whom Tolstoy speaks, a\nfeeling of repugnance, which was all the stronger in Anna inasmuch as\nshe was dimly aware, in her relations with other people whom she liked,\nof the vague sting of desire far more than of the calm impression of\nesthetic judgment. She had no more idea of her own beauty than of her\nsuppressed instincts: or rather, she refused to have any idea of it: and\nwith her habitual self-deception she succeeded in deluding herself.\n",
                "Braun met her at a marriage feast at which she was present, quite\nunusually for her: for she was hardly ever invited because of the evil\nreputation which clung to her from her improper origin. She was\ntwenty-two. He marked her out; not that she made any attempt to attract\nattention. She sat next him at dinner: she was very stiff and badly\ndressed, and she hardly ever opened her mouth. But Braun never stopped\ntalking to her, in a monologue, all through the meal, and he went away\nin raptures. With his usual penetration, he had been struck by his\nneighbor's air of original simplicity: he had admired her common sense\nand her coolness: also he appreciated her healthiness and the solid\ndomestic qualities which she seemed to him to possess. He called on her\ngrandmother, called again, proposed, and was accepted. She was given no\ndowry: Madame Senfl had left all the wealth of her family to the town to\nencourage trade abroad.\n",
                "At no point in her life had the young wife had any love for her husband;\nthe idea of such a thing never seemed to her to play any part in the\nlife of an honest woman, but rather to be properly set aside as guilty.\nBut she knew the worth of Braun's kindness: she was grateful to him,\nthough she never showed it, for having married her in spite of her\ndoubtful origin. Besides, she had a very strong feeling of honor between\nhusband and wife. For the first seven years of their married life\nnothing had occurred to disturb their union. They lived side by side, as\nit were, did not understand each other, and never worried about it: in\nthe eyes of the world they were a model couple. They went out very\nlittle. Braun had a fairly practice, but he had never succeeded in\nmaking his friends accept his wife. No one liked her: and the stigma of\nher birth was not yet quite obliterated. Anna, for her part, never put\nherself out in order to gain admission to society. She was resentful on\naccount of the scorn which had cast a cloud on her childhood. Besides,\nshe was never at her ease in society, and she was not sorry to be left\nout of it. She paid and received a few inevitable calls, such as her\nhusband's interests made necessary. Her callers were inquisitive and\nscandalous women of the middle-class. Anna had not the slightest\ninterest in their gossip, and she never took the trouble to conceal her\nindifference. That is what such people never forgive. So her callers\ngrew fewer and more far between, and Anna was left alone. That was what\nshe wanted: nothing could then come and break in upon the dreams over\nwhich she brooded, and the obscure thrill and humming of life that was\never in her body. Meanwhile for some weeks Anna looked very unwell. Her\nface grew thin and pale. She avoided both Christophe and Braun. She\nspent her days in her room, lost in thought, and she never replied when\nshe was spoken to. Usually Braun did not take much notice of her\nfeminine caprices. He would explain them to Christophe at length. Like\nall men fated to be deceived by women he flattered himself that he knew\nthem through and through. He did know something about them, as a matter\nof fact, but a little knowledge is quite useless. He knew that women\noften have fits of persistent moodiness and blindly sullen antagonism:\nand it was his opinion that it was necessary at such times to leave them\nalone, and to make no attempt to understand or, above all, to find out\nwhat they were doing in the dangerous unconscious world in which their\nminds were steeped. Nevertheless he did begin to grow anxious about\nAnna. He thought that her pining must be the result of her mode of life,\nalways shut up, never going outside the town, hardly ever out of the\nhouse. He wanted her to go for walks: but he could hardly ever go with\nher: the whole day on Sunday was taken up with her pious duties, and on\nthe other days of the week he had consultations all day long. As for\nChristophe, he avoided going out with her. Once or twice they had gone\nfor a short walk together, as far as the gates of the town: they were\nbored to death. Their conversation came to a standstill. Nature seemed\nnot to exist for Anna: she never saw anything: the country was to her\nonly grass and stones: her insensibility was chilling. Christophe tried\nonce to make her admire a beautiful view. She looked, smiled coldly, and\nsaid, with an effort towards being pleasant:\n",
                "\"Oh! yes, it is very mystic....\"\n",
                "She said it just as she might have said:\n",
                "\"The sun is very hot.\"\n",
                "Christophe was so irritated that he dug his nails into the palms of his\nhands. After that he never asked her anything: and when she was going\nout he always made some excuse and stayed in his room.\n",
                "In reality it was not true that Anna was insensible to Nature. She did\nnot like what are conventionally called beautiful landscapes: she could\nsee no difference between them and other landscapes. But she loved the\ncountry whatever it might be like--just earth and air. Only she had no\nmore idea of it than of her other strong feelings: and those who lived\nwith her had even less idea of it.\n",
                "Braun so far insisted as to induce his wife to make a day's excursion\ninto the outskirts of the town. She was so bored with him that she\nconsented for the sake of peace. It was arranged that they should go on\nthe Sunday. At the last moment, the doctor, who had been looking forward\nto it with childlike glee, was detained by an urgent case of illness.\nChristophe went with Anna.\n",
                "It was a fine winter day with no snow: a pure cold air, a clear sky, a\nflaming sun, and an icy wind. They went out on a little local railway\nwhich took them to one of the lines of blue hills which formed a distant\nhalo round the town. Their compartment was full: they were separated.\nThey did not speak to each other. Anna was in a gloomy mood: the day\nbefore she had declared, to Braun's surprise, that she would not go to\nchurch on Sunday. For the first time in her life she missed a service.\nWas it revolt?... Who could tell what struggles were taking place in\nher? She stared blankly at the seat in front of her, she was pale: she\nwas eating her heart out.\n",
                "They got out of the train. The coldness and antagonism between them did\nnot disappear during the first part of their walk. They stepped out side\nby side: she walked with a firm stride and looked at nothing: her hands\nwere free: she swung her arms: her heels rang out on the frozen\nearth.--Gradually her face quickened into life. The swiftness of their\npace brought the color to her pale cheeks. Her lips parted to drink in\nthe keen air. At the turn of a zigzag path she began to climb straight\nup the hillside like a goat; she scrambled along the edge of a quarry,\nwhere she was in great danger of failing, clinging to the shrubs.\nChristophe followed her. She climbed faster and faster, slipping,\nstopping herself by clutching at the grass with her hands. Christophe\nshouted to her to stop. She made no reply, but went on climbing on all\nfours. They passed through the mists which hung above the valley like a\nsilvery gauze rent here and there by the bushes: and they stood in the\nwarm sunlight of the uplands. When she reached the summit she stopped:\nher face was aglow: her mouth was open, and she was breathing heavily.\nIronically she looked down at Christophe scaling the slope, took off her\ncloak, flung it at him, then without giving him time to take his breath,\nshe darted on. Christophe ran after her. They warmed to the game: the\nair intoxicated them. She plunged down a steep slope: the stones gave\nway under her feet: she did not falter, she slithered, jumped, sped down\nlike an arrow. Every now and then she would dart a glance behind her to\nsee how much she had gained on Christophe. He was close upon her. She\nplunged into a wood. The dead leaves crackled under their footsteps: the\nbranches which she thrust aside whipped back into his face. She stumbled\nover the roots of a tree. He caught her. She struggled, lunging out with\nhands and feet, struck him hard, trying to knock him off: she screamed\nand laughed. Her bosom heaved against him: for a moment their cheeks\ntouched: he tasted the sweat that lay on Anna's brow: he breathed the\nscent of her moist hair. She pushed away from him and looked at him,\nunmoved, with defiant eyes. He was amazed at her strength, which all\nwent for nothing in her ordinary life.\n",
                "They went to the nearest village, joyfully trampling the dry stubble\ncrisping beneath their feet. In front of them whirled the crows who were\nransacking the fields. The sun was burning, the wind was biting. He held\nAnna's arm. She had on a rather thin dress: through the stuff he could\nfeel the moisture and the tingling warmth of her body. He wanted her to\nput on her cloak once more: she refused, and in bravado undid the hooks\nat her neck. They lunched at an inn, the sign of which bore the figure\nof a \"wild man\" (_Zum wilden Mann_). A little pine-tree grew in\nfront of the door. The dining-room was decorated with German quatrains,\nand two chromolithographs, one of which was sentimental: _In the\nSpring (Im Fr\u00fchling)_, and the other patriotic: _The Battle of\nSaint Jacques_, and a crucifix with a skull at the foot of the cross.\nAnna had a voracious appetite, such as Christophe had never known her to\nhave. They drank freely of the ordinary white wine. After their meal\nthey set out once more across the fields, in a blithe spirit of\ncompanionship. In neither was there any equivocal thought. They were\nthinking only of the pleasure of their walk, the singing in their blood,\nand the whipping, nipping air. Anna's tongue was loosed. She was no\nlonger on her guard: she said just whatever came into her mind.\n",
                "She talked about her childhood, and how her grandmother used to take her\nto the house of an old friend who lived near the cathedral: and while the\nold ladies talked they sent her into the garden over which there\nhung the shadow of the _M\u00fcnster_. She used to sit in a corner and\nnever stir: she used to listen to the shivering of the leaves, and watch\nthe busy swarming insects: and she used to be both pleased and\nafraid.--(She made no mention of her fear of devils: her imagination was\nobsessed by it: she had been told that they prowled round churches but\nnever dared enter: and she used to believe that they appeared in the\nshape of animals: spiders, lizards, ants, all the hideous creatures that\nswarmed about her, under the leaves, over the earth, or in the crannies\nof the walls).--Then she told him about the house she used to live in,\nand her sunless room: she remembered it with pleasure: she used to spend\nmany sleepless nights there, telling herself things....\n",
                "\"What things?\"\n",
                "\"Silly things.\"\n",
                "\"Tell me.\"\n",
                "She shook her head in refusal.\n",
                "\"Why not?\"\n",
                "She blushed, then laughed, and added:\n",
                "\"In the daytime too, while I was at work.\"\n",
                "She thought for a moment, laughed once more, and then said:\n",
                "\"They were silly things, bad things.\"\n",
                "He said, jokingly:\n\"Weren't you afraid?\"\n",
                "\"Of what?\"\n",
                "\"Of being damned?\"\n",
                "The expression in her eyes froze.\n",
                "\"You mustn't talk of that,\" she said.\n",
                "He turned the conversation. He marveled at the strength she had shown a\nshort while before in their scuffle. She resumed her confiding\nexpression and told him of her girlish achievements--(she said \"boyish,\"\nfor, when she was a child she had always longed to join in the games and\nrights of the boys).--On one occasion when she was with a little boy who\nwas a head taller than herself she had suddenly struck him with her\nfist, hoping that he would strike her back. But he ran away yelling that\nshe was beating him. Once, again, in the country she had climbed on to\nthe back of a black cow as she was grazing: the terrified beast flung\nher against a tree, and she had narrowly escaped being killed. Once she\ntook it into her head to jump out of a first-floor window because she\nhad dared herself to do it: she was lucky enough to get off with a\nsprain. She used to invent strange, dangerous gymnastics when she was\nleft alone in the house: she used to subject her body to all sorts of\nqueer experiments.\n",
                "\"Who would think it of you now, to see you looking so solemn?...\"\n",
                "\"Oh!\" she said, \"if you were to see me sometimes when I am alone in my\nroom!\"\n",
                "\"What! Even now?\"\n",
                "She laughed. She asked him--jumping from one subject to another--if he\nwere a shot.\n",
                "He told her that he never shot. She said that she had once shot at a\nblackbird with a gun and had wounded it. He waxed indignant.\n",
                "\"Oh!\" she said. \"What does it matter?\"\n",
                "\"Have you no heart?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know.\"\n",
                "\"Don't you ever think the beasts are living creatures like ourselves?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" she said. \"Certainly. I wanted to ask you: do you think the\nbeasts have souls?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. I think so.\"\n",
                "\"The minister says not. But I think they have souls.... Sometimes,\" she\nadded, \"I think I must have been an animal in a previous existence.\"\n",
                "He began to laugh.\n",
                "\"There's nothing to laugh at,\" she said (she laughed too). \"That is one\nof the stories I used to tell myself when I was little. I used to\npretend to be a cat, a dog, a bird, a foal, a heifer. I was conscious of\nall their desires. I wanted to be in their skins or their feathers for a\nlittle while: and it used to be as though I really was. You can't\nunderstand that?\"\n",
                "\"You are a strange creature. But if you feel such kinship with the\nbeasts how can you bear to hurt them?\"\n",
                "\"One is always hurting some one. Some people hurt me. I hurt other\npeople. That's the way of the world. I don't complain. We can't afford\nto be squeamish in life! I often hurt myself for the pleasure of it.\"\n",
                "\"Hurt yourself?\"\n",
                "\"Myself. One day I hammered a nail into my hand, here.\"\n",
                "\"Why?\"\n",
                "\"There wasn't any reason.\"\n",
                "(She did not tell him that she had been trying to crucify herself.)\n",
                "\"Give me your hand,\" she said.\n",
                "\"What do you want it for?\"\n",
                "\"Give it me.\"\n",
                "He gave her his hand. She took it and crushed it until he cried out.\nThey played, like peasants, at seeing how much they could hurt each\nother. They were happy and had no ulterior thought. The rest of the\nworld, the fetters of their ordinary life, the sorrows of the past, fear\nof the future, the gathering storm within themselves, all had\ndisappeared.\n",
                "They had walked several miles, but they were not at all tired. Suddenly\nshe stopped, flung herself down on the ground, and lay full length on\nthe stubble, and said no more. She lay on her back with her hands behind\nher head and looked up at the sky. Oh! the peace of it, and the\nsweetness!... A few yards away a spring came bubbling up in an\nintermittent stream, like an artery beating, now faintly, now more\nstrongly. The horizon took on a pearly hue. A mist hung over the purple\nearth from which the black naked trees stood out. The late winter sun\nwas shining, the little pale gold sun sinking down to rest. Like\ngleaming arrows the birds cleft the air. The gentle voices of the\ncountry bells called and answered calling from village to village....\nChristophe sat near Anna and looked down at her. She gave no thought to\nhim. She was full of a heartfelt joy. Her beautiful lips smiled\nsilently. He thought:\n",
                "\"Is that you? I do not know you.\"\n",
                "\"Nor I. Nor I. I think I must be some one else. I am no longer afraid: I\nam no longer afraid of Him.... Ah! How He stifled me, how He made me\nsuffer! I seemed to have been nailed down in my coffin.... Now I can\nbreathe: this body and this heart are mine. My body. My dear body. My\nheart is free and full of love. There is so much happiness in me! And I\nknew it not. I never knew myself! What have you done to me?...\"\n",
                "So he thought he could hear her softly sighing to herself. But she was\nthinking of nothing, only that she was happy, only that all was well.\n",
                "The evening had begun to fall. Behind the gray and lilac veils of mist,\nabout four o'clock, the sun, weary of life, was setting. Christophe got\nup and went to Anna. He bent down to her. She turned her face to him,\nstill dizzy with looking up into the vast sky over which she seemed to\nhave been hanging. A few seconds passed before she recognized him. Then\nher eyes stared at him with an enigmatic smile that told him of the\nunease that was in her. To escape the knowledge of it he closed his eyes\nfor a moment. When he opened them again she was still looking at him:\nand it seemed to him that for many days they had so looked into each\nother's eyes. It was as though they were reading each other's soul. But\nthey refused to admit what they had read there.\n",
                "He held out his hand to her. She took it without a word. They went back\nto the village, the towers of which they could see shaped like the\npope's nose in the heart of the valley: one of the towers had an empty\nstorks' nest on the top of its roof of mossy tiles, looking just like a\ntoque on a woman's head. At a cross-roads just outside the village they\npassed a fountain above which stood a little Catholic saint, a wooden\nMagdalene, graciously and a little mincingly holding out her arms. With\nan instinctive movement Anna responded to the gesture and held out her\narms also, and she climbed on to the curb and filled the arms of the\npretty little goddess with branches of holly and mountain-ash with such\nof their red berries as the birds and the frost had spared.\n",
                "On the road they passed little groups of peasants and peasant women in\ntheir Sunday clothes: women with brown skins, very red cheeks, thick\nplaits coiled round their heads, light dresses, and hats with flowers.\nThey wore white gloves and red cuffs. They were singing simple songs\nwith shrill placid voices not very much in tune. In a stable a cow was\nmooing. A child with whooping-cough was coughing in a house. A little\nfarther on there came up the nasal sound of a clarionet and a cornet.\nThere was dancing in the village square between the little inn and the\ncemetery. Four musicians, perched on a table, were playing a tune. Anna\nand Christophe sat in front of the inn and watched the dancers. The\ncouples were jostling and slanging each other vociferously. The girls\nwere screaming for the pleasure of making a noise. The men drinking were\nbeating time on the tables with their fists. At any other time such\nponderous coarse joy would have disgusted Anna: but now she loved it:\nshe had taken off her hat and was watching eagerly. Christophe poked fun\nat the burlesque solemnity of the music and the musicians. He fumbled in\nhis pockets and produced a pencil and began to make lines and dots on\nthe back of a hotel bill: he was writing dance music. The paper was soon\ncovered: he asked for more, and these too he covered like the first with\nhis big scrawling writing. Anna looked over his shoulder with her face\nnear his and hummed over what he wrote: she tried to guess how the\nphrases would end, and clapped her hands when she guessed right or when\nher guesses were falsified by some unexpected sally. When he had done\nChristophe took what he had written to the musicians. They were honest\nSuabians who knew their business, and they made it out without much\ndifficulty. The melodies were sentimental, and of a burlesque humor,\nwith strongly accented rhythms, punctuated, as it were, with bursts of\nlaughter. It was impossible to resist their impetuous fun: nobody's feet\ncould help dancing. Anna rushed into the throng; she gripped the first\npair of hands held out to her and whirled about like a mad thing; a\ntortoise-shell pin dropped out of her hair and a few locks of it fell\ndown and hung about her face. Christophe never took his eyes off her: he\nmarveled at the fine healthy animal who hitherto had been condemned to\nsilence and immobility by a pitiless system of discipline: he saw her as\nno one had ever seen her, as she really was under her borrowed mask: a\nBacchante, drunk with life. She called to him. He ran to her and put his\narms round her waist. They danced and danced until they whirled crashing\ninto a wall. They stopped, dazed. Night was fully come. They rested for\na moment and then said good-by to the company. Anna, who was usually so\nstiff with the common people, partly from embarrassment, partly from\ncontempt, held out her hand to the musicians, the host of the inn, the\nvillage boys with whom she had been dancing.\n",
                "Once more they were alone under the brilliant frozen sky retracing the\npaths across the fields by which they had come in the morning. Anna was\nstill excited. She talked less and less, and then ceased altogether, as\nthough she had succumbed to fatigue or to the mysterious emotion of the\nnight. She leaned affectionately on Christophe. As they were going down\nthe slope up which they had so blithely scrambled a few hours before,\nshe sighed. They approached the station. As they came to the first house\nhe stopped and looked at her. She looked up at him and smiled sadly. The\ntrain was just as crowded as it had been before, and they could not\ntalk. He sat opposite her and devoured her with his eyes. Her eyes were\nlowered: she raised them and looked at him when she felt his eyes upon\nher: then she glanced away and he could not make her look at him again.\nShe sat gazing out into the night. A vague smile hovered about her lips\nwhich showed a little weariness at the corners. Then her smile\ndisappeared. Her expression became mournful. He thought her mind must be\nengrossed by the rhythm of the train and he tried to speak to her. She\nreplied coldly, without turning her head, with a single word. He tried\nto persuade himself that her fatigue was responsible for the change: but\nhe knew that it was for a very different reason. The nearer they came to\nthe town the more he saw Anna's face grow cold, and life die down in\nher, and all her beautiful body with its savage grace drop back into its\ncasing of stone. She did not make use of the hand he held out to her as\nshe stepped out of the carriage. They returned home in silence.\n",
                "A few days later, about four o'clock in the evening, they were alone\ntogether. Braun had gone out. Since the day before the town had been\nshrouded in a pale greenish fog. The murmuring of the invisible river\ncame up. The lights of the electric trams glared through the mist. The\nlight of day was dead, stifled: time seemed to be wiped out: it was one\nof those hours when men lose all consciousness of reality, an hour which\nis outside the march of the ages. After the cutting wind of the\npreceding days, the moist air had suddenly grown warmer, too damp and\ntoo soft. The sky was filled with snow, and bent under the load.\n",
                "They were alone together in the drawing-room, the cold cramped taste of\nwhich was the reflection of that of its mistress. They said nothing. He\nwas reading. She was sewing. He got up and went to the window: he\npressed his face against the panes, and stood so dreaming: he was\nstupefied and heavy with the dull light which was cast back from the\ndarkling sky upon the livid earth: his thoughts were uneasy: he tried in\nvain to fix them: they escaped him. He was filled with a bitter agony:\nhe felt that he was being engulfed: and in the depths of his being, from\nthe chasm of the heap of ruins came a scorching wind in slow gusts. He\nturned his back on Anna: she could not see him, she was engrossed in her\nwork; but a faint thrill passed through her body: she pricked herself\nseveral times with her needle, but she did not feel it. They were both\nfascinated by the approaching danger.\n",
                "He threw off his stupor and took a few strides across the room. The\npiano attracted him and made him fearful. He looked away from it. As he\npassed it his hand could not resist it, and touched a note. The sound\nquivered like a human voice. Anna trembled, and let her sewing fall.\nChristophe, was already seated and playing. Without seeing her, he knew\nthat Anna had got up, that she was coming towards him, that she was by\nhis side. Before he knew what he was doing, he had begun the religious\nand passionate melody that she had sung the first time she had revealed\nherself to him: he improvised a fugue with variations on the theme.\nWithout his saying a word to her, she began to sing. They lost all sense\nof their surroundings. The sacred frenzy of music had them in its\nclutches....\n",
                "O music, that openest the abysses of the soul! Thou dost destroy the\nnormal balance of the mind. In ordinary life, ordinary souls are closed\nrooms: within, there droop the unused forces of life, the virtues and\nthe vices to use which is hurtful to us: sage, practical wisdom,\ncowardly common sense, are the keepers of the keys of the room. They let\nus see only a few cupboards tidily and properly arranged. But music\nholds the magic wand which drives back every lock. The doors are opened.\nThe demons of the heart appear. And, for the first time, the soul sees\nitself naked.--While the siren sings, while the bewitching voice\ntrembles on the air, the tamer holds all the wild beasts in check with\nthe power of the eye. The mighty mind and reason of a great musician\nfascinates all the passions that he set loose. But when the music dies\naway, when the tamer is no longer there, then the passions he has\nsummoned forth are left roaring in their tottering cage, and they seek\ntheir prey....\n",
                "The melody ended. Silence.... While she was singing she had laid her\nhand on Christophe's shoulder. They dared not move: and each felt the\nother trembling. Suddenly--in a flash--she bent down to him, he turned\nto her: their lips met: he drank her breath....\n",
                "She flung away from him and fled. He stayed, not stirring in the dark.\nBraun returned. They sat down to dinner. Christophe was incapable of\nthought. Anna seemed absent-minded: she was looking \"elsewhere.\" Shortly\nafter dinner she went to her room. Christophe found it impossible to\nstay alone with Braun, and went upstairs also.\n",
                "About midnight the doctor was called from his bed to a patient.\nChristophe heard him go downstairs and out. It had been snowing ever\nsince six o'clock. The houses and the streets were under a shroud. The\nair was as though it were padded with cotton-wool. Not a step, not a\ncarriage could be heard outside. The town seemed dead. Christophe could\nnot sleep. He had a feeling of terror which grew from minute to minute.\nHe could not stir. He lay stiff in his bed, on his back, with his eyes\nwide open. A metallic light cast up from the white earth and roofs fell\nupon the walls of the room.... An imperceptible noise made him tremble.\nOnly a man at a feverish tension could have heard it. Came a soft\nrustling on the floor of the passage. Christophe sat up in bed. The\nfaint noise came nearer, stopped; a board creaked. There was some one\nbehind the door: some one waiting.... Absolute stillness for a few\nseconds, perhaps for several minutes.... Christophe could not breathe,\nhe broke out into a sweat. Outside flakes of snow brushed the window as\nwith a wing. A hand fumbled with the door and opened it. There appeared\na white form, and it came slowly forward: it halted a few yards away\nfrom him. Christophe could see nothing clearly: but he could hear her\nbreathing: and he could hear his own heart thumping. She came nearer to\nhim; once more she halted. Their faces were so near that their breath\nmingled. Their eyes sought each other vainly in the darkness.... She\nfell into his arms. In silence, without a word, they hugged each other\nclose, frenziedly....\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "An hour, two hours, a century later, the door of the house was opened.\nAnna broke from the embrace in which they were locked, slipped away, and\nleft Christophe without a word, just as she had come. He heard her bare\nfeet moving away, just skimming the floor in her swift flight. She\nregained her room, and there Braun found her in her bed, apparently\nasleep. So she lay through the night, with eyes wide open, breathless,\nstill, in her narrow bed near the sleeping Braun. How many nights had\nshe passed like that!\n",
                "Christophe could not sleep either. He was utterly in despair. He had\nalways regarded the things of love, and especially marriage, with tragic\nseriousness. He hated the frivolity of those writers whose art uses\nadultery as a spicy flavoring. Adultery roused in him a feeling of\nrepulsion which was a combination of his vulgar brutality and high\nmorality. He had always felt a mixture of religious respect and physical\ndisgust for a woman who belonged to another man. The doglike promiscuity\nin which some of the rich people in Europe lived appalled him. Adultery\nwith the consent of the husband is a filthy thing: without the husband's\nknowledge it is a base deceit only worthy of a rascally servant hiding\naway to betray and befoul his master's honor. How often had he not\npiteously despised those whom he had known to be guilty of such\ncowardice! He had broken with some of his friends who had thus\ndishonored themselves in his eyes.... And now he too was sullied with\nthe same shameful thing! The circumstances of the crime only made it the\nmore odious. He had come to the house a sick, wretched man. His friend\nhad welcomed him, helped him, given him comfort. His kindness had never\nflagged. Nothing had been too great a demand upon it. He owed him his\nvery life. And in return he had robbed the man of his honor and his\nhappiness, his poor little domestic happiness! He had basely betrayed\nhim, and with whom? With a woman whom he did not know, did not\nunderstand, did not love.... Did he not love her? His every drop of\nblood rose up against him. Love is too faint a word to express the river\nof fire that rushed through him when he thought of her. It was not love,\nit was a thousand times a greater thing than love.... He was in a whirl\nall through the night. He got up, dipped his face in the icy water,\ngasped, and shuddered. The crisis came to a head in an attack of fever.\n",
                "When he got up, aching all over, he thought that she, even more than he,\nmust be overwhelmed with shame. He went to the window. The sun was\nshining down upon the dazzling snow. In the garden Anna was hanging out\nthe clothes on a line. She was engrossed in her work, and seemed to be\nin no wise put out. She had a dignity in her carriage and her gesture\nwhich was quite new to him, and made him, unconsciously, liken her to a\nmoving statue.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "They met again at lunch. Braun was away for the whole day. Christophe\ncould not have borne meeting him. He wanted to speak to Anna. But they\nwere not alone: the servant kept going and coming: they had to keep\nguard on themselves. In vain did Christophe try to catch Anna's eye. She\ndid not look at him or at anything. There was no indication of inward\nferment: and always in her smallest movement there was the unaccustomed\nassurance and nobility. After lunch he hoped they would have an\nopportunity of speaking: but the servant dallied over clearing away; and\nwhen they went into the next room she contrived to follow them: she\nalways had something to fetch or to bring: she stayed bustling in the\npassage near the half-open door which Anna showed no hurry to shut: it\nlooked as though she were spying on them. Anna sat by the window with\nher everlasting sewing. Christophe leaned back in an armchair with his\nback to the light, and a book on his knee which he did not attempt to\nread. Anna could only see his profile, and she noticed the torment in\nhis face as he looked at the wall: and she gave a cruel smile. From the\nroof of the house and the tree in the garden the melting snow trickled\ndown into the gravel with a thin tinkling noise. Some distance away was\nthe laughter of children chasing each other in the street and\nsnowballing. Anna seemed to be half-asleep. The silence was torture to\nChristophe: it hurt him so that he could have cried out.\n",
                "At last the servant went downstairs and left the house. Christophe got\nup, turned to Anna, and was about to say:\n",
                "\"Anna! Anna! what have we done?\"\n",
                "Anna looked at him: her eyes, which had been obstinately lowered, had\njust opened: they rested on Christophe, and devoured him hotly,\nhungrily. Christophe felt his own eyes burn under the impact, and he\nreeled; everything that he wanted to say was brushed aside. They came\ntogether, and once more they were locked in an embrace....\n",
                "The shades of the evening were falling. Their blood was still in\nturmoil. She was lying down, with her dress torn, her arms outstretched.\nHe had buried his face in the pillow, and was groaning aloud. She turned\ntowards him and raised his head, and caressed his eyes and his lips with\nher fingers: she brought her face close to his, and she stared into his\neyes. Her eyes were deep, deep as a lake, and they smiled at each other\nin utter indifference to pain. They lost consciousness. He was silent.\nMighty waves of feeling thrilled through them....\n",
                "That night, when he was alone in his room, Christophe thought of killing\nhimself.\n",
                "Next day, as soon as he was up, he went to Anna. Now it was he whose\neyes avoided hers. As soon as he met their gaze all that he had to say\nwas banished from his mind. However, he made an effort, and began to\nspeak of the cowardice of what they had done. Hardly had she understood\nthan she roughly stopped his lips with her hand. She flung away from him\nwith a scowl, and her lips pressed together, and an evil expression upon\nher face. He went on. She flung the work she was holding down on the\nground, opened the door, and tried to go out. He caught her hands,\nclosed the door, and said bitterly that she was very lucky to be able to\nbanish from her mind all idea of the evil they had done. She struggled\nlike an animal caught in a trap, and cried angrily:\n",
                "\"Stop!... You coward, can't you see how I am suffering?... I won't let\nyou speak! Let me go!\"\n",
                "Her face was drawn, her expression was full of hate and fear, like a\nbeast that has been hurt: her eyes would have killed him, if they\ncould.--He let her go. She ran to the opposite corner of the room to\ntake shelter. He had no desire to pursue her. His heart was aching with\nbitterness and terror. Braun came in. He looked at them, and they stood\nstockishly there. Nothing existed for them outside their own suffering.\n",
                "Christophe went out. Braun and Anna sat down to their meal. In the\nmiddle of dinner Braun suddenly got up to open the window. Anna had\nfainted.\n",
                "Christophe left the town for a fortnight on the pretext of having been\ncalled away. For a whole week Anna remained shut up in her room except\nfor meal-times. She slipped back into consciousness of herself, into her\nold habits, the old life from which she had thought she had broken away,\nfrom which we never break away. In vain did she close her eyes to what\nshe had done. Every day anxiety made further inroads into her heart, and\nfinally took possession of it. On the following Sunday she refused once\nmore to go to church. But the Sunday after that she went, and never\nomitted it again. She was conquered, but not submissive. God was the\nenemy,--an enemy from whose power she could not free herself. She went\nto Him with the sullen anger of a slave who is forced into obedience.\nDuring service her face showed nothing but cold hostility: but in the\ndepths of her soul the whole of her religious life was a fierce, dumbly\nexasperated struggle against the Master whose reproaches persecuted her.\nShe pretended not to hear. She had to hear: and bitterly, savagely, with\nclenched teeth, hard eyes, and a deep frowning furrow in her forehead,\nshe would argue with God. She thought of Christophe with hatred. She\ncould not forgive him for having delivered her for one moment from the\nprison of her soul, only to let her fall back into it again, to be the\nprey of its tormentors. She could not sleep; day and night she went over\nand over the same torturing thoughts: she did not complain: she went on\nobstinately doing her household work and all her other duties, and\nthroughout maintaining the unyielding and obstinate character of her\nwill in her daily life, the various tasks of which she fulfilled with\nthe regularity of a machine. She grew thin, and seemed to be a prey to\nsome internal malady. Braun questioned her fondly and anxiously: he\nwanted to sound her. She repulsed him angrily. The greater her remorse\ngrew for what she had done to him, the more harshly she spoke to him.\nChristophe had determined not to return. He wore himself out. He took\nlong runs and violent exercise, rowed, walked, climbed mountains.\nNothing was able to quench the fire in him.\n",
                "He was more the victim of passion than an ordinary man. It is the\nnecessity of the nature of men of genius. Even the most chaste, like\nBeethoven and B\u00fcrchner, must always be in love: every human capacity is\nraised to a higher degree in them, and as, in them, every human capacity\nis seized on by their imagination, their minds are a prey to a continual\nsuccession of passions. Most often they are only transitory fires: one\ndestroys another, and all are absorbed by the great blaze of the\ncreative spirit. But if the heat of the furnace ceases to fill the soul,\nthen the soul is left defenseless against the passions without which it\ncannot live: it must have passion, it creates passion: and the passions\nwill devour the soul ...--and then, besides the bitter desire that\nharrows the flesh, there is the need of tenderness which drives a man\nwho is weary and disillusioned of life into the mothering arms of the\ncomforter, woman. A great man is more of a child than a lesser man: more\nthan any other, he needs to confide in a woman, to lay his head in the\nsoft hands of the beloved, in the folds of the lap of her gown.\n",
                "But Christophe could not understand.... He did not believe in the\ninevitability of passion--the idiotic cult of the romantics. He believed\nthat a man can and must fight with all the force of his will.... His\nwill! Where was it? Not a trace of it was left. He was possessed. He was\nstung by the barbs of memory, day and night. The scent of Anna's body\nwas with him everywhere. He was like a dismantled hulk, rolling\nrudderless, at the mercy of the winds. In vain did he try to escape, he\nstrove mightily, wore himself out in the attempt: he always found\nhimself brought back to the same place, and he shouted to the wind:\n",
                "\"Break me, break me, then! What do you want of me?\"\n",
                "Feverishly he probed into himself. Why, why this woman?... Why did he\nlove her? It was not for her qualities of heart or mind. There were any\nnumber of better and more intelligent women. It was not for her body. He\nhad had other mistresses more acceptable to his senses. What was\nit?...--\"We love because we love.\"--Yes, but there is a reason, even if\nit be beyond ordinary human reason. Madness? That means nothing. Why\nthis madness?\n",
                "Because there is a hidden soul, blind forces, demons, which every one of\nus bears imprisoned in himself. Our every effort, since the first\nexistence of humanity, has been directed towards the building up against\nthis inward sea of the dykes of our reason and our religions. But a\nstorm arises (and the richest souls are the most subject to storms), the\ndykes are broken, the demons have free play, they find themselves in the\npresence of other souls uptorn by similar powers.... They hurl\nthemselves at each other. Hatred or love? A frenzy of mutual\ndestruction?--Passion is the soul of prey.\n",
                "The sea has burst its bounds. Who shall turn it back into its bed? Then\nmust a man appeal to a mightier than himself. To Neptune, the God of the\ntides.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "After a fortnight of vain efforts to escape, Christophe returned to\nAnna. He could not live away from her. He was stifled.\n",
                "And yet he went on struggling. On the evening of his return, they found\nexcuses for not meeting and not dining together: at night they locked\ntheir doors in fear and dread.--But love was stronger than they. In the\nmiddle of the night she came creeping barefooted, and knocked at his\ndoor. She wept silently. He felt the tears coursing down her cheeks. She\ntried to control herself, but her anguish was too much for her and she\nsobbed. Under the frightful burden of her grief Christophe forgot his\nown: he tried to calm her and gave her tender, comfortable words. She\nmoaned:\n",
                "\"I am so unhappy. I wish I were dead....\"\n",
                "Her plaint pierced his heart. He tried to kiss her. She repulsed him:\n",
                "\"I hate you!... Why did you ever come?\"\n",
                "She wrenched herself away from him. She turned her back on him and shook\nwith rage and grief. She hated him mortally. Christophe lay still,\nappalled. In the silence Anna heard his choking breathing: she turned\nsuddenly and flung her arms round his neck:\n",
                "\"Poor Christophe!\" she said. \"I have made you suffer....\"\n",
                "For the first time he heard pity in her voice.\n",
                "\"Forgive me,\" she said.\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"We must forgive each other.\"\nShe raised herself as though she found it hard to breathe. She sat\nthere, with bowed back, overwhelmed, and said:\n",
                "\"I am ruined.... It is God's will, He has betrayed me.... What can I do\nagainst Him?\"\n",
                "She stayed for a long time like that, then lay down again and did not\nstir. A faint light proclaimed the dawn. In the half-light he saw her\nsorrowful face so near his. He murmured:\n",
                "\"The day.\"\n",
                "She made no movement.\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"So be it. What does it matter?\"\n",
                "She opened her eyes and left him with an expression of utter weariness.\nShe sat for a moment looking down at the floor. In a dull, colorless\nvoice she said:\n",
                "\"I thought of killing him last night.\"\n",
                "He gave a start of terror:\n",
                "\"Anna!\" he said.\n",
                "She was staring gloomily at the window.\n",
                "\"Anna!\" he said again. \"In God's name!... Not him!... He is the best of\nus!...\"\n",
                "She echoed;\n",
                "\"Not him. Very well.\"\n",
                "They looked at each other.\n",
                "They had known it for a long time. They had known where the only way out\nlay. They could not bear to live a lie. And they had never even\nconsidered the possibility of eloping together. They knew perfectly well\nthat that would not solve the problem: for the bitterest suffering came\nnot from the external Obstacles that held them apart, but in themselves,\nin their different souls. It was as impossible for them to live together\nas to live apart. They were driven into a corner.\n",
                "From that moment on they never touched each other: the shadow of death\nwas upon them: they were sacred to each other.\n",
                "But they put off appointing a time for their decision. They kept on\nsaying: \"To-morrow, to-morrow...\" And they turned their eyes away from\ntheir to-morrow, Christophe's mighty soul had Wild spasms Of revolt: he\nwould not consent to his defeat: he despised suicide, and he could not\nresign himself to such a pitiful and abrupt conclusion of his splendid\nlife. As for Anna, how could she, unless she were forced, accept the\nidea of a death which must lead to eternal death? But ruthless necessity\nwas at their heels, and the circle was slowly narrowing about them.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "That morning, for the first time since the betrayal, Christophe was left\nalone with Braun. Until then he had succeeded in avoiding him. He found\nit intolerable to be with him. He had to make an excuse to avoid eating\nat the same table: the food stuck in his throat. To shake the man's\nhand, to eat his bread, to give the kiss of Judas!... Most odious for\nhim to think of was not the contempt he had for himself so much as the\nagony of suffering that Braun must endure if he should come to know....\nThe idea of it crucified him. He knew, only too well that poor Braun\nwould never avenge himself, that perhaps he would not even have the\nstrength to hate them: but what an utter wreck of all his life!... How\nwould he regard him! Christophe felt that he could not face the reproach\nin his eyes.--And it was inevitable that sooner or later Braun would be\nwarned. Did he not already suspect something? Seeing him again after his\nfortnight's absence Christophe was struck by the change in him: Braun\nwas not the same man. His gaiety had disappeared, or there was something\nforced in it. At meals he would stealthily glance at Anna, who talked\nnot at all, ate not at all, and seemed to be burning away like the oil\nin a lamp. With timid, touching kindness he tried to look after her: she\nrejected his attentions harshly: then he bent his head over his plate\nand relapsed into silence. Anna could bear it no longer, and flung her\nnapkin on the table in the middle of the meal and left the room. The two\nmen finished their dinner in silence, or pretended to do so, for they\nate nothing: they dared not raise their eyes. When they had finished,\nChristophe was on the point of going when Braun suddenly clasped his arm\nwith both hands and said:\n",
                "\"Christophe!\"\n",
                "Christophe looked at him uneasily.\n",
                "\"Christophe,\" said Braun again--(his voice was shaking),--\"do you know\nwhat's the matter with her?\"\n",
                "Christophe stood transfixed: for a moment or two he could find nothing\nto say. Braun stood looking at him timidly: very quickly he begged\nhis pardon:\n",
                "\"You see a good deal of her, she trusts you....\"\n",
                "Christophe was very near taking Braun's hands and kissing them and\nbegging his forgiveness. Braun saw Christophe's downcast expression,\nand, at once, he was terrified, and refused to see: he cast him a\nbeseeching look and stammered hurriedly and gasped:\n",
                "\"No, no. You know nothing? Nothing?\"\n",
                "Christophe was overwhelmed and said:\n",
                "\"No.\"\n",
                "Oh! the bitterness of not being able to lay bare his offense, to humble\nhimself, since to do so would be to break the heart of the man he had\nwronged! Oh! the bitterness of being unable to tell the truth, when he\ncould see in the eyes of the man asking him for it, that he could not,\nwould not know the truth!...\n",
                "\"Thanks, thank you. I thank you....\" said Braun.\n",
                "He stayed with his hands plucking at Christophe's sleeve as though there\nwas something else he wished to ask, and yet dared not, avoiding his\neyes. Then he let go, sighed, and went away.\n",
                "Christophe was appalled by this new lie. He hastened to Anna. Stammering\nin his excitement, he told her what had happened. Anna listened gloomily\nand said:\n",
                "\"Oh, well. He knows. What does it matter?\"\n",
                "\"How can you talk like that?\" cried Christophe. \"It is horrible! I will\nnot have him suffer, whatever it may cost us, whatever it may cost.\"\n",
                "Anna grew angry.\n",
                "\"And what if he does suffer? Don't I have to suffer? Let him suffer\ntoo!\"\n",
                "They said bitter things to each other. He accused her of loving only\nherself. She reproached him with thinking more of her husband than of\nherself.\n",
                "But a moment later, when he told her that he could not go on living like\nthat, and that he would go and tell the whole story to Braun, then she\ncried out on him for his selfishness, declaring that she did not care a\nbit about Christophe's conscience, but was quite determined that Braun\nshould never know.\n",
                "In spite of her hard words she was thinking as much of Braun as of\nChristophe. Though she had no real affection for her husband she was\nfond of him. She had a religious respect for social ties and the duties\nthey involve. Perhaps she did not think that it was the duty of a wife\nto be kind and to love her husband: but she did think that she was\ncompelled scrupulously to fulfil her household duties and to remain\nfaithful. It seemed to her ignoble to fail in that object as she herself\nhad done.\n",
                "And even more surely than Christophe she knew that Braun must know\neverything very soon. It was something to her credit that she concealed\nthe fact from Christophe, either because she did not wish to add to his\ntroubles or more probably because of her pride.\n",
                "Secluded though the Braun household was, secret though the tragedy might\nremain that was being enacted there, some hint of it had trickled away\nto the outer world.\n",
                "In that town it was impossible for any one to flatter himself that the\nfacts of his life were hidden. This was strangely true. No one ever\nlooked at anybody in the streets: the doors and shutters of the houses\nwere closed. But there were mirrors fastened in the corners of the\nwindows: and as one passed the houses one could hear the faint creaking\nof the Venetian shutters being pushed open and shut again. Nobody took\nany notice of anybody else: everything and everybody were apparently\nignored: but it was not long before one perceived that not a single\nword, not a single gesture had been unobserved: whatever one did,\nwhatever one said, whatever one saw, whatever one ate was known at once:\neven what one thought was known, or, at least, everybody pretended to\nknow. One was surrounded by a universal, mysterious watchfulness.\nServants, tradespeople, relations, friends, people who were neither\nfriends nor enemies, passing strangers, all by tacit agreement shared in\nthis instinctive espionage, the scattered elements of which were\ngathered to a head no one knew how. Not only were one's actions\nobserved, but they probed into one's inmost heart. In that town no man\nhad the right to keep the secrets of his conscience, and everybody had\nthe right to rummage amongst his intimate thoughts, and, if they were\noffensive to public opinion, to call him to account. The invisible\ndespotism of the collective mind dominated the individual: all his life\nhe remained like a child in a state of tutelage: he could call nothing\nhis own: he belonged to the town.\n",
                "It was enough for Anna to have stayed away from church two Sundays\nrunning to arouse suspicion. As a rule no one seemed to notice her\npresence at service: she lived outside the life of the place, and the\ntown seemed to have forgotten her existence.--On the evening of the\nfirst Sunday when she had stayed away her absence was known to everybody\nand docketed in their memory. On the following Sunday not one of the\npious people following the blessed words in their Bibles or on the\nminister's lips seemed to be distracted from their solemn attention: not\none of them had failed to notice as they entered, and to verify as they\nleft, the fact that Anna's place was empty. Next day Anna began to\nreceive visits from women she had not seen for many months: they came on\nvarious pretexts, some fearing that she was ill, others assuming a new\ninterest in her affairs, her husband, her house: some of them showed a\nsingularly intimate knowledge of the doings of her household: not one of\nthem--(with clumsy ingenuity)--made any allusion to her absence from\nchurch on two Sundays running. Anna said that she was unwell and\ndeclared that she was very busy. Her visitors listened attentively and\napplauded her: Anna knew that they did not believe a word she said.\nTheir eyes wandered round the room, prying, taking notes, docketing.\nThey did not for a moment drop their cold affability or their noisy\naffected chatter: but their eyes revealed the indiscreet curiosity which\nwas devouring them. Two or three with exaggerated indifference inquired\nafter M. Krafft.\n",
                "A few days later--(during Christophe's absence),--the minister came\nhimself. He was a handsome, good-natured creature, splendidly healthy,\naffable, with that imperturbable tranquillity which comes to a man from\nthe consciousness of being in sole possession of the truth, the whole\ntruth. He inquired anxiously after the health of the members of his\nflock, politely and absently listened to the excuses she gave him, which\nhe had not asked for, accepted a cup of tea, made a mild joke or two,\nexpressed his opinion on the subject of drink that the wine referred to\nin the Bible was not alcoholic liquor, produced several quotations, told\na story, and, as he was leaving, made a dark allusion to the danger of\nbad company, to certain excursions in the country, to the spirit of\nimpiety, to the impurity of dancing, and the filthy lusts of the flesh.\nHe seemed to be addressing his remarks to the age in general and not to\nAnna. He stopped for a moment, coughed, got up, bade Anna give his\nrespectful compliments to M. Braun, made a joke in Latin, bowed, and\ntook his leave.--Anna was left frozen by his allusion. Was it an\nallusion? How could he have known about her excursion with Christophe?\nThey had not met a soul of their acquaintance that day. But was not\neverything known in the town? The musician with the remarkable face and\nthe young woman in black who had danced at the inn had attracted much\nattention: their descriptions had been spread abroad; and, as the story\nwas bandied from mouth to mouth, it had reached the town where the\nwatchful malice of the gossips had not failed to recognize Anna. No\ndoubt it amounted as yet to no more than a suspicion, but it was\nsingularly attractive, and it was augmented by information supplied by\nAnna's maid. Public curiosity had been a-tip-toe, waiting for them to\ncompromise each other, spying on them with a thousand invisible eyes.\nThe silent crafty people of the town were creeping close upon them, like\na cat lying in wait for a mouse.\n",
                "In spite of the danger Anna would in all probability not have given in:\nperhaps her consciousness of such cowardly hostility would have driven\nher to some desperate act of provocation if she had not herself been\npossessed by the Pharisaic spirit of the society which was so\nantagonistic to her. Her education had subjugated her nature. It was in\nvain that she condemned the tyranny and meanness of public opinion: she\nrespected it: she subscribed to its decrees even when they were directed\nagainst herself: if they had come into conflict with her conscience, she\nwould have sacrificed her conscience. She despised the town: but she\ncould not have borne the town to despise herself.\n",
                "Now the time was coming when the public scandal would be afforded an\nopportunity of discharging itself. The carnival was coming on.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "In that city, the carnival had preserved up to the time of the events\nnarrated in this history--(it has changed since then)--a character of\narchaic license and roughness. Faithfully in accordance with its origin,\nby which it had been a relaxation for the profligacy of the human mind\nsubjugated, wilfully or involuntarily, by reason, it nowhere reached\nsuch a pitch of audacity as in the periods and countries in which custom\nand law, the guardians of reason, weighed most heavily upon the people.\nThe town in which Anna lived was therefore one of its most chosen\nregions. The more moral stringency paralyzed action and gagged speech,\nthe bolder did action become and speech the more untrammeled during\nthose few days. Everything that was secreted away in the lower depths of\nthe soul, jealousy, secret hate, lewd curiosity, the malicious instincts\ninherent in the social animal, would burst forth with all the vehemence\nand joy of revenge. Every man had the right to go out into the streets,\nand, prudently masked, to nail to the pillory, in full view of the\npublic gaze, the object of his detestation, to lay before all and sundry\nall that he had found out by a year of patient industry, his whole hoard\nof scandalous secrets gathered drop by drop. One man would display them\non the cars. Another would carry a transparent lantern on which were\npasted in writings and drawings the secret history of the town. Another\nwould go so far as to wear a mask in imitation of his enemy, made so\neasily recognizable that the very gutter-snipes would point him out by\nname. Slanderous newspapers would appear during the three days. Even the\nvery best people would craftily take part in the game of _Pasquino_. No\ncontrol was exercised except over political allusions,--such coarse\nliberty of speech having on more than one occasion produced fierce\nconflict between the authorities of the town and the representatives of\nforeign countries. But there was nothing to protect the citizens against\nthe citizens, and this cloud of public insult, constantly hanging over\ntheir heads, did not a little help to maintain the apparently impeccable\nmorality on which the town prided itself.\n",
                "Anna felt the weight of that dread--which was quite unjustified. She had\nvery little reason to be afraid. She occupied too small a place in the\nopinion of the town for any one to think of attacking her. But in the\nabsolute isolation in which of her own choice she lived, in her state of\nexhaustion and nervous excitement brought on by several weeks of\nsleepless nights and moral suffering, her imagination was apt to welcome\nthe most unreasoning terrors. She exaggerated the animosity of those who\ndid not like her. She told herself that suspicion was on her track: the\nveriest trifle was enough to ruin her: and there was nothing to assure\nher that it was not already an accomplished fact. It would mean insult,\npitiless exposure, her heart laid bare to the mockery of the passers-by:\ndishonor so cruel that Anna was near dying of shame at the very thought\nof it. She called to mind how, a few years before, a girl, who had been\nthe victim of such persecution, had had to fly the country with her\nfamily.... And she could do nothing, nothing to defend herself, nothing\nto prevent it, nothing even to find out if it was going to happen. The\nsuspense was even more maddening than the certainty. Anna looked\ndesperately about her like an animal at bay. In her own house she knew\nthat she was hemmed in.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Anna's servant was a woman of over forty: her name was B\u00e4bi: she was\ntall and strong: her face was narrow and bony round her brow and\ntemples, wide and long in the lower part, fleshy under the jaw, roughly\npear-shaped: she had a perpetual smile and eyes that pierced like\ngimlets, sunken, as though they had been sucked in, beneath red eyelids\nwith colorless lashes. She never put off her expression of coquettish\ngaiety: she was always delighted with her superiors, always of their\nopinion, worrying about their health with tender interest: smiling when\nthey gave her orders: smiling when they scolded her. Braun believed that\nshe was unshakably devoted. Her gushing manner was strongly in contrast\nwith Anna's coldness. However, she was like her in many things: like her\nshe spoke little and dressed in a severe neat style: like her she was\nvery pious, and went to service with her, scrupulously fulfilling all\nher religious duties and nicely attending to her household tasks: she\nwas clean, methodical, and her morals and her kitchen were beyond\nreproach. In a word she was an exemplary servant and the perfect type of\ndomestic foe. Anna's feminine instinct was hardly ever wrong in her\ndivination of the secret thoughts of women, and she had no illusions\nabout her. They detested each other, knew it, and never let it appear.\n",
                "On the night of Christophe's return, when Anna, torn by her desire and\nher emotion, went to him once more in spite of her resolve never to see\nhim again, she walked stealthily, groping along the wall in the\ndarkness: just as she reached Christophe's door, instead of the ordinary\ncold smooth polished floor, she felt a warm dust softly crunching under\nher bare feet. She stooped, touched it with her hands, and understood: a\nthin layer of ashes had been spread for the space of a few yards across\nthe passage. Without knowing it B\u00e4bi had happed on the old device\nemployed in the days of the old Breton songs by Frocin the dwarf to\ncatch Tristan on his way to Yseult: so true it is that a limited number\nof types, good and bad, serve for all ages. A remarkable piece of\nevidence in favor of the wise economy of the universe!--Anna did not\nhesitate; she did not stop or turn, but went on in a sort of\ncontemptuous bravado: she went to Christophe, told him nothing, in spite\nof her uneasiness: but when she returned she took the stove brush and\ncarefully effaced every trace of her footsteps in the ashes, after she\nhad crossed over them.--When Anna and B\u00e4bi met next day it was with the\nusual coldness and the accustomed smile.\n",
                "B\u00e4bi used sometimes to receive a visit from a relation who was a little\nolder than herself: he fulfilled the function of beadle of the church:\nduring _Gottesdienst_ (Divine service) he used to stand sentinel at\nthe church door, wearing a white armlet with black stripes and a silver\ntassel, leaning on a cane with a curved handle. By trade he was an\nundertaker. His name was Sami Witschi. He was very tall and thin, with a\nslight stoop, and he had the clean-shaven solemn face of an old peasant.\nHe was very pious and knew better than any one all the tittle-tattle of\nthe parish. B\u00e4bi and Sami were thinking of getting married: they\nappreciated each other's serious qualities, and solid faith and malice.\nBut they were in no hurry to make up their minds: they prudently took\nstock of each other,--Latterly Sami's visits had become more frequent.\nHe would come in unawares. Every time Anna went near the kitchen and\nlooked through the door, she would see Sami sitting near the fire, and\nB\u00e4bi a few yards away, sewing. However much they talked, it was\nimpossible to hear a sound. She could see B\u00e4bi's beaming face and her\nlips moving: Sami's wide hard mouth would stretch in a grin without\nopening: not a sound would come up from his throat: the house seemed to\nbe lost in silence. Whenever Anna entered the kitchen, Sami would rise\nrespectfully and remain standing, without a word, until she had gone out\nagain. Whenever B\u00e4bi heard the door open, she would ostentatiously break\noff in the middle of a commonplace remark, and turn to Anna with an\nobsequious smile and wait for her orders. Anna would think they were\ntalking about her: but she despised them too much to play the\neavesdropper.\n",
                "The day after Anna had dodged the ingenious trap of the ashes, as she\nentered the kitchen, the first thing she saw in Sami's hand was the\nlittle broom she had used the night before to wipe out the marks of her\nbare feet. She had taken it out of Christophe's room, and that very\nminute, she suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to take it back\nagain; she had left it in her own room, where B\u00e4bi's sharp eyes had seen\nit at once. The two gossips had immediately put two and two together.\nAnna did not flinch. B\u00e4bi followed her mistress's eyes, gave an\nexaggerated smile, and explained:\n",
                "\"The broom was broken: I gave it to Sami to mend.\"\n",
                "Anna did not take the trouble to point out the gross falsehood of the\nexcuse: she did not seem even to hear it: she looked at B\u00e4bi's work,\nmade a few remarks, and went out again impassively. But when the door\nwas closed she lost all her pride: she could not help hiding behind the\ncorner of the passage and listening--(she was humiliated to the very\ndepths of her being at having to stoop to such means: but fear mastered\nher).--She heard a dry chuckle of laughter. Then whispering, so low that\nshe could not make out what was said. But in her desperation Anna\nthought she heard: her terror breathed into her ears the words she was\nafraid of hearing: she imagined that they were speaking of the coming\nmasquerades and a charivari. There was no doubt: they would try to\nintroduce the episode of the ashes. Probably she was wrong: but in her\nstate of morbid excitement, having for a whole fortnight been haunted by\nthe fixed idea of public insult, she did not stop to consider whether\nthe uncertain could be possible: she regarded it as certain.\n",
                "From that time on her mind was made up.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "On the evening of the same day--(it was the Wednesday preceding the\ncarnival)--Braun was called away to a consultation twenty miles out of\nthe town: he would not return until the next morning. Anna did not come\ndown to dinner and stayed in her room. She had chosen that night to\ncarry out the tacit pledge she had made with herself. But she had\ndecided to carry it out alone, and to say nothing to Christophe. She\ndespised him. She thought:\n",
                "\"He promised. But he is a man, he is an egoist and a liar. He has his\nart. He will soon forget.\"\n",
                "And then perhaps there was in her passionate heart that seemed so\ninaccessible to kindness, room for a feeling of pity for her companion.\nBut she was too harsh and too passionate to admit it to herself.\n",
                "B\u00e4bi told Christophe that her mistress had bade her to make her excuses\nas she was not very well and wished to rest. Christophe dined alone\nunder B\u00e4bi's supervision, and she bored him with her chatter, tried to\nmake him talk, and protested such an extraordinary devotion to Anna,\nthat, in spite of his readiness to believe in the good faith of men,\nChristophe became suspicious. He was counting on having a decisive\ninterview with Anna that night. He could no more postpone matters than\nshe. He had not forgotten the pledge they had given each other at the\ndawn of that sad day. He was ready to keep it if Anna demanded it of\nhim. But he saw the absurdity of their dying together, how it would not\nsolve the problem, and how the sorrow of it and the scandal must fall\nupon Braun's shoulders. He was inclined to think that the best thing to\ndo was to tear themselves apart and for him to try once more to go right\naway,--to see at least if he were strong enough to stay away from her:\nhe doubted it after the vain attempt he had made before: but he thought\nthat, in case he could not bear it, he would still have time to turn to\nthe last resort, alone, without anybody knowing.\n",
                "He hoped that after supper he would be able to escape for a moment to go\nup to Anna's room. But B\u00e4bi dogged him. As a rule she used to finish her\nwork early: but that night she seemed never to have done with scrubbing\nher kitchen: and when Christophe thought he was rid of her, she took it\ninto her head to tidy a cupboard in the passage leading to Anna's room.\nChristophe found her standing on a stool, and he saw that she had no\nintention of moving all evening. He felt a furious desire to knock her\nover with her piles of plates: but he restrained himself and asked her\nto go and see how her mistress was and if he could say good-night to\nher. B\u00e4bi went, returned, and said, as she watched him with a malicious\njoy, that Madame was better and was asleep and did not want anybody to\ndisturb her. Christophe tried irritably and nervously to read, but could\nnot, and went up to his room. B\u00e4bi watched his light until it was put\nout, and then went upstairs to her room, resolving to keep watch: she\ncarefully left her door open so that she could hear every sound in the\nhouse. Unfortunately for her, she could not go to bed without at once\nfalling asleep and sleeping so soundly that not thunder, not even her\nown curiosity, could wake her up before daybreak. Her sound sleep Was no\nsecret. The echo of it resounded through the house even to the lower\nfloor.\n",
                "As soon as Christophe heard the familiar noise he went to Anna's room.\nIt was imperative that he should speak to her. He was profoundly uneasy.\nHe reached her door, turned the handle: the door was locked. He knocked\nlightly: no reply. He placed his lips to the keyhole and begged her in a\nwhisper, then more loudly, to open: not a movement, not a sound.\nAlthough he told himself that Anna was asleep, he was in agonies. And\nas, in a vain attempt to hear, he laid his cheek against the door, a\nsmell came to his nostrils which seemed to be issuing from the room: he\nbent down and recognised it; it was the smell of gas. His blood froze.\nHe shook the door, never thinking that he might wake B\u00e4bi: the door did\nnot give.... He understood: in her dressing-room, which led out of her\nroom, Anna had a little gas-stove: she had turned it on. He must break\nopen the door: but in his anxiety Christophe kept his senses enough to\nremember that at all costs B\u00e4bi must not hear. He leaned against one of\nthe leaves of the door and gave an enormous shove as quietly as he\ncould. The solid, well-fitting door creaked on its hinges, but did not\nyield. There was another door which led from Anna's room to Braun's\ndressing-room. He ran to it. That too was locked: but the lock was\noutside. He started to tug it off. It was not easy. He had to remove the\nfour big screws which were buried deep in the wood. He had only his\nknife and he could not see: for he dared not light a candle; it would\nhave meant blowing the whole place up. Fumblingly he managed to fit his\nknife, into the head of a screw, then another, breaking the blades and\ncutting himself; the screws seemed to be interminably long, and he\nthought he would never be able to get them out: and, at the same time,\nin the feverish haste which was making his body break out into a cold\nsweat, there came to his mind a memory of his childhood: he saw himself,\na boy of ten, shut up in a dark room as a punishment: he had taken off\nthe lock and run out of the house.... The last screw came out. The lock\ngave with a crackling noise like the sawing of wood. Christophe plunged\ninto the room, rushed to the window, and opened it. A flood of cold air\nswept in. Christophe bumped into the furniture in the dark and came to\nthe bed, groped with his hands, and came on Anna's body, tremblingly\nfelt her legs lying still under the clothes, and moved his hands up to\nher waist: Anna was sitting up in bed, trembling. She had not had time\nto feel the first effects of asphyxiation: the room was high: the air\ncame through the chinks in the windows and the doors, Christophe caught\nher in his arms. She broke away from him angrily, crying:\n",
                "\"Go away!... Ah! What have you done?\"\n",
                "She raised her hands to strike him: but she was worn out with emotion:\nshe fell back on her pillow and sobbed:\n",
                "\"Oh! Oh! We've to go through it all over again!\"\n",
                "Christophe took her hands in his, kissed her, scolded her, spoke to her\ntenderly and roughly:\n",
                "\"You were going to die, to die, alone, without me!\"\n",
                "\"Oh! You!\" she said bitterly.\n",
                "Her tone was as much as to say:\n",
                "\"You want to live.\"\n",
                "He spoke harshly to her and tried to break down her will.\n",
                "\"You are mad!\" he said. \"You might have blown the house to pieces!\"\n\"I wanted to,\" she said angrily.\n",
                "He tried to play on her religious fears: that was the right note. As\nsoon as he touched on it she began to scream and to beg him to stop. He\nwent on pitilessly, thinking that it was the only means of bringing her\nback to the desire to live. She said nothing more, but lay sobbing\nconvulsively. When he had done, she said in a tone of intense hatred:\n",
                "\"Are you satisfied now? You've done your work well. You've brought me to\ndespair. And now, what am I to do?\"\n",
                "\"Live,\" he said.\n",
                "\"Live!\" she cried. \"You don't know how impossible it is! You know\nnothing! You know nothing!\"\n",
                "He asked:\n",
                "\"What is it?\"\n",
                "She shrugged her shoulders:\n",
                "\"Listen.\"\n",
                "In a few brief disconnected sentences she told him all that she had\nconcealed from him: B\u00e4bi's spying on her, the ashes, the scene with\nSami, the carnival, the public insult that was before her. As she told\nher story she was unable to distinguish between the figments of her fear\nand what she had any reason to fear. He listened in utter consternation,\nand was no more capable than she of discerning between the real and the\nimaginary in her story. Nothing had ever been farther from his mind than\nto suspect how they were being dogged. He tried to understand: he could\nfind nothing to say: against such enemies he was disarmed. Only he was\nconscious of a blind fury, a desire to strike and to destroy. He said:\n",
                "\"Why didn't you dismiss B\u00e4bi?\"\n",
                "She did not deign to reply. B\u00e4bi dismissed would have been even more\nvenomous than B\u00e4bi tolerated: and Christophe saw the idiocy of his\nquestion. His thoughts were in a whirl: he was trying to discover a way\nout, some immediate action upon which to engage. He clenched his fists\nand cried:\n",
                "\"I'll kill them?\"\n",
                "\"Who?\" she said, despising him for his futile words.\n",
                "He lost all power of thought or action. He felt that he was lost in such\na network of obscure treachery, in which it was impossible to clutch at\nanything since all were parties to it. He writhed.\n",
                "\"Cowards!\" he cried, in sheer despair.\n",
                "He slipped down on to his knees and buried his face against Anna.--They\nwere silent for a little. She felt a mixture of contempt and pity for\nthe man who could defend neither himself nor her. He felt Anna's limbs\ntrembling with cold against his cheek. The window had been left open,\nand outside it was freezing: they could see the icy stars shivering in\nthe sky that was smooth and gleaming as a mirror.\n",
                "When she had fully tasted the bitter joy of seeing him as broken as\nherself, she said in a hard, weary voice:\n",
                "\"Light the candle.\"\n",
                "He did so. Anna's teeth were chattering, she was sitting huddled up,\nwith her arms tight folded across her chest and her knees up to her\nchin. He closed the window. Then he sat on the bed. He laid his hands on\nAnna's feet: they were cold as ice, and he warmed them with his hands\nand lips. She was softened.\n",
                "\"Christophe!\" she said.\n",
                "Her eyes were pitiful to see.\n",
                "\"Anna!\" said he.\n",
                "\"What are we going to do?\"\n",
                "He looked at her and replied:\n",
                "\"Die.\"\n",
                "She gave a cry of joy.\n",
                "\"Oh! You will? You will?... I shall not be alone!\"\n",
                "She kissed him.\n",
                "\"Did you think I was going to let you?\"\n",
                "She replied in a whisper:\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "A few moments later he questioned her with his eyes. She understood.\n",
                "\"In the bureau,\" she said. \"On the right. The bottom drawer.\"\n",
                "He went and looked. At the back of the drawer he found a revolver. Braun\nhad bought it as a student. He had never made use of it. In an open box\nChristophe found some cartridges. He took them to the bed. Anna looked\nat them, and at once turned her eyes away to the wall.\n",
                "Christophe waited, and then asked:\n",
                "\"You don't want to...?\"\n",
                "Anna turned abruptly:\n",
                "\"I will.... Quick!\"\n",
                "She thought:\n",
                "\"Nothing can save me now from the everlasting pit. A little more or\nless, it will be just the same.\"\n",
                "Christophe awkwardly loaded the revolver.\n",
                "\"Anna,\" he said, and his voice trembled. \"One of us will see the other\ndie.\"\n",
                "She wrenched the pistol out of his hands and said selfishly:\n",
                "\"I shall be the first.\"\n",
                "They looked at each other once more.... Alas! At the very moment when\nthey were to die for each other they felt so far apart!... Each was\nthinking in terror:\n",
                "\"What am I doing? What am I doing?\"\n",
                "And each was reading the other's eyes. The absurdity of the thing was\nwhat struck Christophe most. All his life gone for nothing: vain his\nstruggles: vain his suffering: vain his hopes: all botched, flung to the\nwinds: one foolish act was to wipe all away.... In his normal state he\nwould have wrenched the revolver away from Anna and flung it out of the\nwindow and cried:\n",
                "\"No, no! I will not.\"\n",
                "But eight months of suffering, of doubt and torturing grief, and on top\nof that the whirlwind of their crazy passion, had wasted his strength\nand broken his will: he felt that he could do nothing now, that he was\nno longer master of himself.... Ah! what did it matter, after all?\n",
                "Anna, feeling certain that she was doomed to everlasting death,\nstretched every nerve to catch and hold the last minute of her life:\nChristophe's sorrowful face lit by the flickering candle, the shadows on\nthe wall, a footstep in the street, the cold contact of the steel in her\nhand.... She clung to these sensations, as a shipwrecked man clings to\nthe spar that sinks beneath his weight. Afterwards all was terror. Why\nnot prolong the time of waiting? But she said to herself:\n",
                "\"I must....\"\n",
                "She said good-by to Christophe, with no tenderness, with the haste of a\nhurried traveler fearful of losing the train: she bared her bosom, felt\nfor her heart, and laid the mouth of the revolver against it. Christophe\nhid his face. Just as she was about to fire she laid her left hand on\nChristophe's. It was the gesture of a child dreading to walk in the\ndarkness....\n",
                "Then a few frightful seconds passed.... Anna did not fire. Christophe\nwanted to raise his head, to take her in his arms: and he was afraid\nthat his very movement might bring her to the point of firing. He heard\nnothing more: he lost consciousness.... A groan from Anna pierced his\nheart. He got up. He saw Anna with her face distorted in terror. The\nrevolver had fallen down on to the bed. She kept on saying plaintively;\n",
                "\"Christophe!... It has missed fire!...\"\n",
                "He took the pistol: it had lain long forgotten and had grown rusty: but\nthe trigger was in working order. Perhaps the cartridges had gone bad\nwith exposure to the air.--Anna held out her hand for the revolver.\n",
                "\"Enough! Enough!\" he implored her.\n",
                "She commanded him:\n",
                "\"The cartridges!\"\n",
                "He gave them to her. She examined them, took one, loaded the pistol,\ntrembling, put the pistol to her breast, and fired.--Once more it missed\nfire.\n",
                "Anna flung the revolver out into the room.\n",
                "\"Oh! It is horrible, horrible!\" she cried. \"_He_ will not let me die!\"\n",
                "She writhed and sobbed: she was like a madwoman. He tried to touch her:\nshe beat him off, screaming. Finally she had a nervous attack.\nChristophe stayed with her until morning. At last she was pacified: but\nshe lay still and breathless, with her eyes closed and the livid skin\nstretched tight over the bones of her forehead and cheeks: she looked\nlike one dead.\n",
                "Christophe repaired the disorder of her bed, picked up the revolver,\nfastened on the lock he had wrenched away, tidied up the whole room.,\nand went away: for it was seven o'clock and B\u00e4bi might come at any\nmoment.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "When Braun returned next morning he found Anna in the same prostrate\ncondition. He saw that something extraordinary had happened: but he\ncould glean nothing either from B\u00e4bi or Christophe. All day long Anna\ndid not stir: she did not open her eyes: her pulse was so weak that he\ncould hardly feel it: every now and then it would stop, and, for a\nmoment, Braun would be in a state of agony, thinking that her heart had\nstopped. His affection made him doubt his own knowledge: he ran and\nfetched a colleague. The two men examined Anna and could not make up\ntheir minds whether it was the beginning of a fever, or a case of\nnervous hysteria: they had to keep the patient under observation. Braun\nnever left Anna's bedside. He refused to eat. Towards evening Anna's\npulse gave no signs of fever, but was extremely weak. Braun tried to\nforce a few spoonfuls of milk between her lips: she brought it back at\nonce. Her body lay limp in her husband's arms like a broken doll. Braun\nspent the night with her, getting up every moment to listen to her\nbreathing. B\u00e4bi, who was hardly at all put out by Anna's illness, played\nthe devoted servant and refused to go to bed and sat up with Braun.\n",
                "On the Friday Anna opened her eyes. Braun spoke to her: she took no\nnotice of him. She lay quite still with her eyes staring at a mark on\nthe wall. About midday Braun saw great tears trickling down her thin\ncheeks: he dried them gently: one by one the tears went on trickling\ndown. Once more Braun tried to make her take some food. She took it\npassively. In the evening she began to talk: loose snatches of\nsentences. She talked about the Rhine: she had tried to drown herself,\nbut there was not enough water. In her dreams she persisted in\nattempting suicide, imagining all sorts of strange forms of death;\nalways death was at the back of her thoughts. Sometimes she was arguing\nwith some one, and then her face would take on an expression of fear and\nanger: she addressed herself to God, and tried obstinately to prove that\nit was all His fault. Or the flame of desire would kindle in her eyes,\nand she would say shameless things which it seemed impossible that she\nshould know. Once she saw B\u00e4bi, and gave precise orders for the morrow's\nwashing. At night she dozed. Suddenly she got up: Braun ran to her. She\nlooked at him strangely, and babbled impatient formless words. He asked\nher:\n",
                "\"My dear Anna, what do you want?\"\n",
                "She said harshly:\n",
                "\"Go and bring him.\"\n",
                "\"Who?\" he asked.\n",
                "She looked at him once more with the same expression and suddenly burst\nout laughing: then she drew her hands over her forehead and moaned:\n",
                "\"Oh! my God! Let me forget!...\"\n",
                "Sleep overcame her. She was at peace until day. About dawn she moved a\nlittle: Braun raised her head to give her to drink: she gulped down a\nfew mouthfuls, and, stooping to Braun's hands, she kissed them. Once more\nshe dozed off.\n",
                "On the Saturday morning she woke up about nine o'clock. Without saying a\nword, she began to slip out of bed. Braun went quickly to her and tried\nto make her lie down again. She insisted. He asked her what she wanted\nto do. She replied:\n",
                "\"Go to church.\"\n",
                "He tried to argue with her and to remind her that it was not Sunday and\nthe church was closed. She relapsed into silence: but she sat in a chair\nnear the bed, and began to put on her clothes with trembling fingers.\nBraun's doctor-friend came in. He joined Braun in his entreaties: then,\nseeing that she would not give in, he examined her, and finally\nconsented. He took Braun aside, and told him that his wife's illness\nseemed to be altogether moral, and that for the time being he must avoid\nopposing her wishes, and that he could see no danger in her going out,\nso long as Braun went with her. Braun told Anna that he would go with\nher. She refused, and insisted on going alone. But she stumbled as soon\nas she tried to walk across the room. Then, without a word, she took\nBraun's arm, and they went out. She was very weak, and kept stopping.\nSeveral times he asked her if she wanted to go home. She began to walk\non. When they reached the church, as he had told her, they found the\ndoors closed. Anna sat down on a bench near the door, and stayed,\nshivering, until the clock struck twelve. Then she took Braun's arm\nagain, and they came home in silence. But in the evening she wanted to\ngo to church again. Braun's entreaties were useless. He had to go out\nwith her once more.\n",
                "Christophe had spent the two days alone. Braun was too anxious to think\nabout him. Only once, on the Saturday morning, when he was trying to\ndivert Anna's mind from her fixed idea of going out, he had asked her if\nshe would like to see Christophe. She had looked at him with such an\nexpression of fear and loathing that he could not but remark it: and he\nnever pronounced Christophe's name again.\n",
                "Christophe had shut himself up in his room. Anxiety, love, remorse, a\nvery chaos of sorrow was whirling in him. He blamed himself for\neverything. He was overwhelmed by self-disgust. More than once he had\ngot up to go and confess the whole story to Braun--and each time he had\nimmediately been arrested by the thought of bringing wretchedness to yet\nanother human being by his self-accusation. At the same time he was\nspared nothing of his passion. He prowled about in the passage outside\nAnna's room; and when he heard footsteps inside coming to the door he\nrushed away to his own room.\n",
                "When Braun and Anna went out in the afternoon, he looked out for them\nfrom behind his window-curtains. He saw Anna. She who had been so erect\nand proud walked now with bowed back, lowered head, yellow complexion:\nshe was an old woman bending under the weight of the cloak and shawl her\nhusband had thrown about her: she was ugly. But Christophe did not see\nher ugliness: he saw only her misery; and his heart ached with pity and\nlove. He longed to run to her, to prostrate himself in the mud, to kiss\nher feet: her dear body so broken and destroyed by passion, and to\nimplore her forgiveness. And he thought as he looked after her:\n",
                "\"My work.... That is what I have done!\"\n",
                "But when he looked into the mirror and saw his own face, he was shown\nthe same devastation in his eyes, in all his features: he saw the marks\nof death upon himself, as upon her, and he thought:\n",
                "\"My work? No. It is the work of the cruel Master who drives us mad and\ndestroys us.\"\n",
                "The house was empty. B\u00e4bi had gone out to tell the neighbors of the\nday's events. Time was passing. The clock struck five. Christophe was\nfilled with terror as he thought of Anna's return and the coming of the\nnight. He felt that he could not bear to stay under the same roof with\nher for another night. He felt his reason breaking beneath the weight of\npassion. He did not know what to do, he did not know what he wanted,\nexcept that he wanted Anna at all costs. He thought of the wretched face\nhe had just seen going past his window, and he said to himself:\n",
                "\"I must save her from myself!...\"\n",
                "His will stirred into life.\n",
                "He gathered together the litter of papers on the table, tied them up,\ntook his hat and cloak, and went out. In the passage, near the door of\nAnna's room, he hurried forward in a spasm of fear. Downstairs he\nglanced for the last time into the empty garden. He crept away like a\nthief in the night. An icy mist pricked his face and hands. Christophe\nskirted the walls of the houses, dreading a meeting with any one he\nknew. He went to the station, and got into a train which was just\nstarting for Lucerne. At the first stopping-place he wrote to Braun. He\nsaid that he had been called away from the town on urgent business for a\nfew days, and that he was very sorry to have to leave him at such a\ntime: he begged him to send him news, and gave him an address. At\nLucerne he took the St. Gothard train. Late at night he got out at a\nlittle station between Altorf and Goeschenen. He did not know the name,\nnever knew it. He went into the nearest inn by the station. The road was\nfilled with pools of water. It was raining in torrents: it rained all\nnight and all next day. The water was rushing and roaring like a\ncataract from a broken gutter. Sky and earth were drowned, seemingly\ndissolved and melted like his own mind. He went to bed between damp\nsheets which smelt of railway smoke. He could not lie still. The idea of\nthe danger hanging over Anna was too much in his mind for him to feel\nhis own suffering as yet. Somehow he must avert public malignity from\nher, somehow turn it aside upon another track. In his feverish condition\na queer idea came to him: he decided to write to one of the few\nmusicians with whom he had been acquainted in the little town, Krebs,\nthe confectioner-organist. He gave him to understand that he was off to\nItaly upon an affair of the heart, that he had been possessed by the\npassion when he first took up his abode with the Brauns, and that he had\ntried to shake free of it, but it had been too strong for him. He put\nthe whole thing clearly enough for Krebs to understand, and yet so\nveiled as to enable him to improve on it as he liked. Christophe\nimplored Krebs to keep his secret. He knew that the good little man\nsimply could not keep anything to himself, and--quite rightly--he\nreckoned on Krebs hastening to spread the news as soon as it came into\nhis hands. To make sure of hoodwinking the gossips of the town\nChristophe closed his letter with a few cold remarks about Braun and\nabout Anna's illness.\n",
                "He spent the rest of the night and the next day absorbed by his fixed\nIdea.... Anna.... Anna.... He lived through the last few months with\nher, day by day: he did not see her as she was, but enveloped her with a\npassionate atmosphere of illusion. From the very beginning he had\ncreated her in the image of his own desire, and given her a moral\ngrandeur, a tragic consciousness which he needed to heighten his love\nfor her. These lies of passion gained in intensity of conviction now\nthat they were beyond the control of Anna's presence. He saw in her a\nhealthy free nature, oppressed, struggling to shake off its fetters,\nreaching upwards to a wider life of liberty in the open air of the soul,\nand then, fearful of it, struggling against her dreams, wrestling with\nthem, because they could not be brought into line with her destiny, and\nmade it only the more sorrowful and wretched. She cried to him: \"Help\nme.\" He saw once more her beautiful body, clasped it to him. His\nmemories tortured him: he took a savage delight in mortifying the wounds\nthey dealt him. As the day crept on, the feeling of all that he had lost\nbecame so frightful that he could not breathe.\n",
                "Without knowing what he was doing, he got up, went out, paid his bill,\nand took the first train back to the town in which Anna lived. He\narrived in the middle of the night: he went straight to the house. There\nwas a wall between the alley and the garden next to Braun's. Christophe\nclimbed the wall, jumped down into the next-door garden, and then into\nBraun's. He stood outside the house. It was in darkness save for a\nnight-light which cast a yellow glow upon a window--the window of Anna's\nroom. Anna was there. She was suffering. He had only to make one stride\nto enter. He laid his hand on the handle of the door. Then he looked at\nhis hand, the door, the garden: suddenly he realized what he was doing:\nand, breaking free of the hallucination which had been upon him for the\nlast seven or eight hours, he groaned, wrenched free of the inertia\nwhich held him riveted to the ground whereon he stood, ran to the wall,\nscaled it, and fled.\n",
                "That same night he left the town for the second time: and next day he\nwent and buried himself in a mountain village, hidden from the world by\ndriving blizzards.--There he would bury his heart, stupefy his thoughts,\nand forget, and forget!...\n",

                "Oh! God, what have I done to Thee? Why dost Thou overwhelm me? Since I\nwas a little child Thou hast appointed misery and conflict to be my lot.\nI have struggled without complaint. I have loved my misery. I have tried\nto preserve the purity of the soul Thou gavest me, to defend the fire\nwhich Thou hast kindled in me.... Lord, it is Thou, it is Thou who art\nso furious to destroy what Thou hast created. Thou hast put out the\nfire, Thou hast besmirched my soul. Thou hast despoiled me of all that\ngave me life. I had but two treasurable things in the world: my friend\nand my soul. Now I have nothing, for Thou hast taken everything from me.\nOne only creature was mine in the wilderness of the world: Thou hast\ntaken him from me. Our hearts were one. Thou hast torn them asunder:\nThou hast made us know the sweetness of being together only to make us\nknow the horror of being lost to each other. Thou hast created emptiness\nall about me. Thou hast created emptiness within me. I was broken and\nsick, unarmed and robbed of my will. Thou hast chosen that hour to\nstrike me down. Thou hast come stealthily with silent feet from behind\ntreacherously, and Thou hast stabbed me: Thou hast let loose upon me Thy\nfierce dogs of passion; I was weak, and Thou knewest it, and I could not\nstruggle: passion has laid me low, and thrown me into confusion, and\nbefouled me, and destroyed all that I had.... I am left only in\nself-disgust. If I could only cry aloud my grief and my shame! or forget\nthem in the rushing stream of creative force! But my strength is broken,\nand my creative power is withered up. I am like a dead tree.... Would I\nwere dead! O God, deliver me, break my body and my soul, tear me from\nthis earth, leave me not to struggle blindly in the pit, leave me not in\nthis endless agony! I cry for mercy.... Lord, make an end!\n",

                "So in his sorrow Christophe cried upon a God in whom his reason did not\nbelieve.\n",

                "He had taken refuge in a lonely farm in the Swiss Jura Mountains. The\nhouse was built in the woods tucked away in the folds of a high humpy\nplateau. It was protected from the north winds by crags and boulders. In\nfront of it lay a wide stretch of fields, and long wooded slopes: the\nrock suddenly came to an end in a sheer precipice: twisted pines hung on\nthe edge of it; behind were wide-spreading beeches. The sky was blotted\nout. There was no sign of life. A wide stretch of country with all its\nlines erased. The whole place lay sleeping under the snow. Only at night\nin the forest foxes barked. It was the end of the winter. Slow dragging\nwinter. Interminable winter. When it seemed like to break up, snow would\nfall once more, and it would begin again.\n",
                "However, for a week now the old slumbering earth had felt its heart slow\nbeating to new birth. The first deceptive breath of spring crept into\nthe air and beneath the frozen crust. From the branches of the\nbeech-trees, stretched out like soaring wings, the snow melted. Already\nthrough the white cloak of the fields there peered a few thin blades of\ngrass of tender green: around their sharp needles, through the gaps in\nthe snow, like so many little mouths, the dank black earth was\nbreathing. For a few hours every day the voice of the waters, sleeping\nbeneath their robe of ice, murmured. In the skeleton woods a few birds\npiped their shrill clear song.\n",
                "Christophe noticed nothing. All things were the same to him. He paced up\nand down, up and down his room. Or be would walk outside. He could not\nkeep still. His soul was torn in pieces by inward demons. They fell upon\nand rent each other. His suppressed passion never left off beating\nfuriously against the walls of the house of its captivity. His disgust\nwith passion was no less furiously in revolt: passion and disgust flew\nat each other's throats, and, in their conflict, they lacerated his\nheart. And at the same time he was delivered up to the memory of\nOlivier, despair at his death, the hunger to create which nothing could\nsatisfy, and pride rearing on the edge of the abyss of nothingness. He\nwas a prey to all devils. He had no moment of respite. Or, if there came\na seeming calm, if the rushing waves did fall back for a moment, it was\nonly that he might find himself alone, and nothing in himself: thought,\nlove, will, all had been done to death.\n",
                "To create! That was the only loophole. To abandon the wreck of his life\nto the mercy of the waves! To save himself by swimming in the dreams of\nart!... To create! He tried.... He could not.\n",
                "Christophe had never had any method of working. When he was strong and\nwell he had always rather suffered from his superabundance than been\ndisturbed at seeing it diminish: he followed his whim: he used to work\nfirst as the fancy took him, as circumstances chanced, with no fixed\nrule. As a matter of fact, he was always working everywhere: his brain\nwas always busy. Often and often Olivier, who was less richly endowed\nand more reflective, had warned him:\n",
                "\"Take care. You are trusting too much to your force. It is a mountain\ntorrent. Full to-day, perhaps dry to-morrow. An artist must coax his\ngenius: he must not let it scatter itself at random. Turn your force\ninto a channel. Train yourself in habits of mind and a healthy system of\ndaily work, at fixed hours. They are as necessary to the artist as the\npractice of military movements and steps to a man who is to go into\nbattle. When moments of crisis come--(and they always do come)--the\nbracing of steel prevents the soul from destruction. I know. It is just\nthat that has saved me from death.\"\n",
                "But Christophe used to laugh and say:\n",
                "\"That's all right for you, my boy I There's no danger of my losing my\ntaste for life. My appetite's too good.\"\n",
                "Olivier would shrug his shoulders:\n",
                "\"Too much ends in too little. There are no worse invalids than the men\nwho have always had too much health.\"\n",
                "And now Olivier's words had come true. After the death of his friend the\nsource of his inward life had not all at once dried up: but it had\nbecome strangely intermittent: it flowed in sudden gushes, then stopped,\nthen disappeared under the earth. Christophe had paid no heed to it:\nwhat did it matter to him? His grief and his budding passion had\nabsorbed his mind.--But after the storm had passed, when once more he,\nturned to the fountain to drink, he could find no trace of it. All was\nbarren. Not a trickle of water. His soul was dried up. In vain did he\ntry to dig down into the sand, and force the water up from the\nsubterranean wells, and create at all costs: the machine of his mind\nrefused to obey. He could not invoke the aid of habit, the faithful\nally, which, when we have lost every reason for living, alone, constant\nand firmly loyal, stays with us, and speaks no word, and makes no sign,\nbut with eyes fixed, and silent lips, with its sure unwavering hand\nleads us by the hand through the dangerous chasm until the light of day\nand the joy of life return. Christophe was helpless: and his hand could\nfind no guiding hand in the darkness. He could not find his way back to\nthe light of day.\n",
                "It was the supreme test. Then he felt that he was on the verge of\nmadness. Sometimes he would wage an absurd and crazy battle with his own\nbrain, maniacal obsessions, a nightmare of numbers: he would count the\nboards on the floor, the trees in the forest: figures and chords, the\nchoice of which was beyond his reason. Sometimes he would lie in a state\nof prostration, like one dead.\n",
                "Nobody worried about him. He lived apart in one wing of the house. He\ntidied his own room--or left it undone, every day. His meals were laid\nfor him downstairs: he never saw a human face. His host, an old peasant,\na taciturn, selfish creature, took no interest in him. Whether\nChristophe ate or did not eat was his affair. He hardly ever noticed\nwhether Christophe came in at night. Once he was lost in the forest,\nburied up to his hips in the snow: he was very near never returning. He\ntried to wear himself out to keep himself from thinking. He could not\nsucceed. Only now and then could he snatch a few hours of troubled\nsleep.\n",
                "Only one living creature seemed to take any notice of his existence:\nthis was an old St. Bernard, who used to come and lay his big head with\nits mournful eyes on Christophe's knees when Christophe was sitting on\nthe seat in front of the house. They would look long at each other.\nChristophe would not drive him away. Unlike the sick Goethe, the dog's\neyes had no uneasiness for him. Unlike him, he had no desire to cry:\n",
                "\"Go away!... Thou goblin, thou shalt not catch me, whatever thou doest!\"\n",
                "He asked nothing better than to be engrossed by the dog's suppliant\nsleepy eyes and to help the beast: he felt that there must be behind\nthem an imprisoned soul imploring his aid.\n",
                "In those hours when he was weak with suffering, torn alive away from\nlife, devoid of human egoism, he saw the victims of men, the field of\nbattle in which man triumphed in the bloody slaughter of all other\ncreatures: and his heart was filled with pity and horror. Even in the\ndays when he had been happy he had always loved the beasts: he had never\nbeen able to bear cruelty towards them: he had always had a detestation\nof sport, which he had never dared to express for fear of ridicule:\nperhaps even he had never dared to admit it to himself: but his feeling\nof repulsion had been the secret cause of the apparently inexplicable\nfeeling of dislike he had had for certain men: he had never been able to\nadmit to his friendship a man who could kill an animal for pleasure. It\nwas not sentimentality: no one knew better than he that life is based on\nsuffering and infinite cruelty: no man can live without making others\nsuffer. It is no use closing our eyes and fobbing ourselves off with\nwords. It is no use either coming to the conclusion that we must\nrenounce life and sniveling like children. No. We must kill to live, if,\nat the time, there is no other means of living. But the man who kills\nfor the sake of killing is a miscreant. An unconscious miscreant, I\nknow. But, all the same, a miscreant. The continual endeavor of man\nshould be to lessen the sum of suffering and cruelty: that is the first\nduty of humanity.\n",
                "In ordinary life those ideas remained buried in Christophe's inmost heart.\nHe refused to think of them. What was the good? What could he do?\nHe had to be Christophe, he had to accomplish his work, live at all\ncosts, live at the cost of the weak.... It was not he who had made the\nuniverse.... Better not think of it, better not think of it.... But when\nunhappiness had dragged him down, him, too, to the level of the\nvanquished, he had to think of these things Only a little while ago he\nhad blamed Olivier for plunging into futile remorse and vain compassion\nfor all the wretchedness that men suffer and inflict. Now he went even\nfarther: with all the vehemence of his mighty nature he probed to the\ndepths of the tragedy of the universe: he suffered all the sufferings of\nthe world, and was left raw and bleeding. He could not think of the\nanimals without shuddering in anguish. He looked into the eyes of the\nbeasts and saw there a soul like his own, a soul which could not speak;\nbut the eyes cried for it:\n",
                "\"What have I done to you? Why do you hurt me?\"\n",
                "He could not bear to see the most ordinary sights that he had seen\nhundreds of times--a calf crying in a wicker pen, with its big,\nprotruding eyes, with their bluish whites and pink lids, and white\nlashes, its curly white tufts on its forehead, its purple snout, its\nknock-kneed legs:--a lamb being carried by a peasant with its four legs\ntied together, hanging head down, trying to hold its head up, moaning\nlike a child, bleating and lolling its gray tongue:--fowls huddled\ntogether in a basket:--the distant squeals of a pig being bled to\ndeath:--a fish being cleaned on the kitchen-table.... The nameless\ntortures which men inflict on such innocent creatures made his heart\nache. Grant animals a ray of reason, imagine what a frightful nightmare\nthe world is to them: a dream of cold-blooded men, blind and deaf,\ncutting their throats, slitting them open, gutting them, cutting them\ninto pieces, cooking them alive, sometimes laughing at them and their\ncontortions as they writhe in agony. Is there anything more atrocious\namong the cannibals of Africa? To a man whose mind is free there is\nsomething even more intolerable in the sufferings of animals than in the\nsufferings of men. For with the latter it is at least admitted that\nsuffering is evil and that the man who causes it is a criminal. But\nthousands of animals are uselessly butchered every day without a shadow\nof remorse. If any man were to refer to it, he would be thought\nridiculous.--And that is the unpardonable crime. That alone is the\njustification of all that men may suffer. It cries vengeance upon all\nthe human race. If God exists and tolerates it, it cries vengeance upon\nGod. If there exists a good God, then even the most humble of living\nthings must be saved. If God is good only to the strong, if there is no\njustice for the weak and lowly, for the poor creatures who are offered\nup as a sacrifice to humanity, then there is no such thing as goodness,\nno such thing as justice....\n",
                "Alas! The slaughter accomplished by man is so small a thing of itself in\nthe carnage of the universe! The animals devour each other. The peaceful\nplants, the silent trees, are ferocious beasts one to another. The\nserenity of the forests is only a commonplace of easy rhetoric for the\nliterary men who only know Nature through their books!... In the forest\nhard by, a few yards away from the house, there were frightful struggles\nalways toward. The murderous beeches flung themselves upon the pines\nwith their lovely pinkish stems, hemmed in their slenderness with\nantique columns, and stifled them. They rushed down upon the oaks and\nsmashed them, and made themselves crutches of them. The beeches were\nlike Briareus with his hundred arms, ten trees in one tree! They dealt\ndeath all about them. And when, failing foes, they came together, they\nbecame entangled, piercing, cleaving, twining round each other like\nantediluvian monsters. Lower down, in the forest, the acacias had left\nthe outskirts and plunged into the thick of it and attacked the\npinewoods, strangling and tearing up the roots of their foes, poisoning\nthem with their secretions. It was a struggle to the death in which the\nvictors at once took possession of the room and the spoils of the\nvanquished. Then the smaller monsters would finish the work of the\ngreat. Fungi, growing between the roots, would suck at the sick tree,\nand gradually empty it of its vitality. Black ants would grind exceeding\nsmall the rotting wood. Millions of invisible insects were gnawing,\nboring, reducing to dust what had once been life.... And the silence of\nthe struggle!... Oh! the peace of Nature, the tragic mask that covers\nthe sorrowful and cruel face of Life! Christophe was going down and\ndown. But he was not the kind of man to let himself drown without a\nstruggle, with his arms held close to his sides. In vain did he wish to\ndie: he did everything in his power to remain alive. He was one of those\nmen of whom Mozart said: _\"They must act until at last they have no\nmeans of action.\"_ He felt that he was sinking, and in his fall he\ncast about, striking out with his arms to right and left, for some\nsupport to which to cling. It seemed to him that he had found it. He had\njust remembered Olivier's little boy. At once he turned on him all his\ndesire for life: he clung to him desperately. Yes: he must go and find\nhim, claim him, bring him up, love him, take the place of his father,\nbring Olivier to life again in his son. Why had he not thought of it in\nthe selfishness of his sorrow? He wrote to C\u00e9cile, who had charge of the\nboy. He waited feverishly for her reply. His whole being was bent upon\nthe one thought. He forced himself to be calm: he still had reason for\nhope. He was quite confident about it: he knew how kind C\u00e9cile was.\n",
                "Her answer came. C\u00e9cile said that three months after Olivier's death, a\nlady in black had come to her house and said:\n",
                "\"Give me back my child!\"\n",
                "It was Jacqueline, who had deserted her child and Olivier,--Jacqueline,\nbut so changed that she had hardly recognized her. Her mad love affair\nhad not lasted. She had wearied of her lover more quickly than her lover\nhad done of her. She had come back broken, disgusted, aged. The too\nflagrant scandal of her adventure had closed many doors to her. The\nleast scrupulous had not been the least severe. Even her mother had been\nso offensive and so contemptuous that Jacqueline had found it impossible\nto stay with her. She had seen through and through the world's\nhypocrisy. Olivier's death had been the last blow. She seemed so utterly\nsorrowful that C\u00e9cile had not thought it right to refuse to let her have\nher boy. It was hard for her to have to give up the little creature,\nwhom she had grown so used to regarding as her own. But how could she\nmake things even harder for a woman who had more right than herself, a\nwoman who was further more unhappy? She had wanted to write to\nChristophe to ask his advice. But Christophe had never answered the\nletters she had written him, she did not know his address, she did not\neven know whether he was alive or dead.... Joy comes and goes. What\ncould she do? Only resign herself to the inevitable. The main thing was\nfor the child to be happy and to be loved....\n",
                "The letter reached him in the evening. A belated gust of winter brought\nback the snow. It fell all night. In the forest, where already the young\nleaves had appeared, the trees cracked and split beneath the weight of\nit. They went off like a battery of artillery. Alone in his room,\nwithout a light, surrounded only by the phosphorescent darkness,\nChristophe sat listening to the tragic sounds of the forest, and started\nat every crack: and he was like one of the trees bending beneath its\nload and snapping. He said to himself:\n",
                "\"Now the end has come.\"\n",
                "Night passed. Day came. The tree was not broken. All through the new day\nand the following night the tree went on bending and cracking: but it\ndid not break. Christophe had no reason for living left: and he went on\nliving. He had no motive for struggling; and he struggled, body to body,\nfoot to foot, with the invisible enemy who was bending his back. He was\nlike Jacob with the angel. He expected nothing from the fight, he\nexpected nothing now but the end, rest; and he went on fighting. And he\ncried aloud:\n",
                "\"Break me and have done! Why dost thou not throw me down?\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Days passed. Christophe issued from the fight, utterly lifeless. Yet he\nwould not lie down, and insisted on going out and walking. Happy are\nthose men who are sustained by the fortitude of their race in the hours\nof eclipse of their lives! Though the body of the son was near\nbreaking-point, the strength of the father and the grandfather held him\nup: the energy and impetus of his robust ancestors sustained his broken\nsoul, like a dead knight being carried along by his horse.\n",

                "Along a precipitous road he went with a ravine on either hand: he went\ndown the narrow path, thick with sharp stones, among which coiled the\ngnarled roots of the little stunted oaks: he did not know where he was\ngoing, and yet he was more surefooted than if he had been moving under\nthe lucid direction of his will. He had not slept, he had hardly eaten\nanything for several days. He saw a mist in front of his eyes. He walked\ndown towards the valley.--It was Easter-week. A cloudy day. The last\nassault of winter had been overcome. The warmth of spring was brooding.\nFrom the villages far down the sound of bells came up: first from a\nvillage nestling in a hollow at the foot of the mountain, with its\ndappled thatched roofs, dark and light in patches, covered with thick,\nvelvety moss. Then from another, out of sight, on the other slope of the\nhill. Then, others down on the plain beyond the river. And the distant\nhum of a town seen hazily in the mist. Christophe stopped. His heart\nalmost stopped beating. Their voices seemed to be saying:\n",
                "\"Come with us. Here is peace. Here sorrow is dead. Dead, and thought is\ndead too. We croon so sweetly to the soul that it sleeps in our arms,\nCome, and rest, and thou shalt not wake again.\"\n",
                "He felt so worn out! He was so fain to sleep! But he shook his head and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"It is not peace that I seek, but life.\"\n",
                "He went on his way. He walked for miles without noticing it. In his\nstate of weakness and hallucination the simplest sensations came to him\nwith unexpected resonance. Over earth and air his mind cast fantastic\nlights. A shadow, with nothing to cause it that he could see, going\nbefore him on the white and sunless road, made him tremble.\n",
                "As he emerged from a wood he found himself near a village. He turned\nback: the sight of men hurt him. However, he could not avoid passing by\na lonely house above the hamlet: it was built on the side of the\nmountain, and looked like a sanatorium: it was surrounded by a large\ngarden open to the sun; a few men were wandering with faltering\nfootsteps along the gravel paths. Christophe did not look at it\nparticularly: but at a turn of the path he came face to face with a man\nwith pale eyes and a fat, yellow face, staring blankly, who had sunk\ndown on a seat at the foot of two poplar trees. Another man was sitting\nby his side: they were both silent. Christophe walked past them. But, a\nfew yards on, he stopped: the man's eyes had seemed familiar to him. He\nturned. The man had not stirred: he was still staring fixedly at\nsomething in front of him. But his companion looked at Christophe, who\nbeckoned to him. He came up.\n",
                "\"Who is he?\" asked Christophe.\n",
                "\"A patient in the asylum,\" said the man, pointing to the house.\n",
                "\"I think I know him,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"Possibly,\" replied the man. \"He was a well-known writer in Germany.\"\n",
                "Christophe mentioned a name.--Yes. That was the name.--He had met him\nonce in the days when he was writing for Mannheim's review. Then, they\nwere enemies: Christophe was only just beginning, and the other was\nalready famous. He had been a man of considerable power, very\nself-confident, very contemptuous of other men's work, a novelist whose\nrealistic and sensual writings had stood out above the mediocrity of the\nproductions of his day. Christophe, who detested the man, could not help\nadmiring the perfection of his materialistic art, which was sincere,\nthough limited.\n",
                "\"He went mad a year ago,\" said the keeper. \"He was treated, regarded as\ncured, and sent home. Then he went mad again. One evening he threw\nhimself out of the window. At first, when he came here, he used to fling\nhimself about and shout. But now he is quite quiet. He spends his days\nsitting there, as you see.\"\n",
                "\"What is he looking at?\" asked Christophe.\n",
                "He went up to the seat, and looked pitifully at the pale face of the\nmadman, with his heavy eyelids drooping over his eyes: one of them\nseemed to be almost shut. The madman seemed to be unaware of\nChristophe's presence. Christophe spoke to him by name and took his\nhand--a soft, clammy hand, which lay limp in his like a dead thing: he\nhad not the courage to keep it in his: the man raised his glazing eyes\nto Christophe for a moment, then went on staring straight in front of\nhim with his besotted smile. Christophe asked:\n",
                "\"What are you looking at?\"\n",
                "The man said, without moving, in a whisper:\n",
                "\"I am waiting.\"\n",
                "\"What for?\"\n",
                "\"The Resurrection.\"\n",
                "Christophe started back. He walked hurriedly away. The word had burnt\ninto his very soul.\n",
                "He plunged into the forest, and climbed up the hillside in the direction\nof his own house. In his confusion he missed his way, and found himself\nin the middle of an immense pine-wood. Darkness and silence. A few\npatches of sunlight of a pale, ruddy gold, come it was impossible to\ntell whence, fell aslant the dense shadows. Christophe was hypnotized by\nthese patches of light. Round him everything seemed to be in darkness.\nHe walked along over the carpet of pine-needles, tripping over the roots\nwhich stood out like swollen veins. At the foot of the trees were\nneither plants nor moss. In the branches was never the song of a bird.\nThe lower branches were dead. All the life of the place had fled upwards\nto meet the sun. Soon even the life overhead would be gone. Christophe\npassed into a part of the wood which was visited by some mysterious\npestilence. A kind of long, delicate lichen, like spiders' webs, had\nfastened upon the branches of the red pines, and wrapped them about with\nits meshes, binding them from hand to foot, passing from tree to tree,\nchoking the life out of the forest. It was like the deep-sea alga with\nits subtle tentacles. There was in the place the silence of the depths\nof the ocean. High overhead hung the pale sun. Mists which had crept\ninsidiously through the forest encompassed Christophe. Everything\ndisappeared: there was nothing to be seen. For half an hour Christophe\nwandered at random in the web of the white mist, which grew slowly\nthicker, black, and crept down into his throat: he thought he was going\nstraight: but he was walking in a circle beneath the gigantic spiders'\nwebs hanging from the stifled pines: the mist, passing through them,\nleft them enriched with shivering drops of water. At last the meshes\nwere rent asunder, a hole was made, and Christophe managed to make his\nway out of the submarine forest. He came to living woods and the silent\nconflict of the pines and the beeches. But everywhere there was the same\nstillness. The silence, which had been brooding for hours, was\nagonizing. Christophe stopped to listen....\n",
                "Suddenly, in the distance, there came a storm. A premonitory gust of\nwind blew up from the depths of the forest. Like a galloping horse it\nrushed over the swaying tree-tops. It was like the God of Michael Angelo\npassing in a water-spout. It passed over Christophe's head. The forest\nrustled, and Christophe's heart quivered. It was the Annunciation....\n",
                "Silence came again. In a state of holy terror Christophe walked quickly\nhome, with his legs giving way beneath him. At the door of the house he\nglanced fearfully behind him, like a hunted man. All Nature seemed dead.\nThe forests which covered the sides of the mountain were sleeping, lying\nheavy beneath a weight of sadness. The still air was magically clear and\ntransparent. There was never a sound. Only the melancholy music of a\nstream--water eating away the rock--sounded the knell of the earth,\nChristophe went to bed in a fever. It the stable hard by the beasts\nstirred as restlessly and uneasily as he....\n",
                "Night. He had dozed off. In the silence the distant storm arose once\nmore. The wind returned, like a hurricane now,--the _foehn_ of the\nspring, with its burning breath warming the still sleeping, chilly\nearth, the _foehn_ which melts the ice and gathers fruitful rains.\nIt rumbled like thunder in the forests on the other side of the ravine.\nIt came nearer, swelled, charged up the slopes: the whole mountain\nroared. In the stable a horse neighed and the cows lowed. Christophe's\nhair stood on end, he sat up in bed and listened. The squall came up\nscreaming, set the shutters banging, the weather-cocks squeaking, made\nthe slates of the roof go crashing down, and the whole house shake. A\nflower-pot fell and was smashed. Christophe's window was insecurely\nfastened, and was burst open with a bang, and the warm wind rushed in.\nChristophe received its blast full in his face and on his naked chest.\nHe jumped out of bed gaping, gasping, choking. It was as though the\nliving God were rushing into his empty soul. The Resurrection!... The\nair poured down his throat, the flood of new life swelled through him\nand penetrated to his very marrow. He felt like to burst, he wanted to\nshout, to shout for joy and sorrow: and there would only come\ninarticulate sounds from his mouth. He reeled, he beat on the walls with\nhis arms, while all around him were sheets of paper flying on the wind.\nHe fell down in the middle of the room and cried:\n",
                "\"O Thou, Thou! Thou art come back to me at last!\"\n",
                "\"Thou art come back to me, Thou art come back to me! O Thou, whom I had\nlost!... Why didst Thou abandon me?\"\n",
                "\"To fulfil My task, that thou didst abandon.\"\n",
                "\"What task?\"\n",
                "\"My fight.\"\n",
                "\"What need hast Thou to fight? Art Thou not master of all?\"\n",
                "\"I am not the master.\"\n",
                "\"Art Thou not All that Is?\"\n",
                "\"I am not all that is. I am Life fighting Nothingness. I am not\nNothingness, I am the Fire which burns in the Night. I am not the Night.\nI am the eternal Light; I am not an eternal destiny soaring above the\nfight. I am free Will which struggles eternally. Struggle and burn with\nMe.\"\n",
                "\"I am conquered. I am good for nothing.\"\n",
                "\"Thou art conquered? All seems lost to thee? Others will be conquerors.\nThink not of thyself, think of My army.\"\n",
                "\"I am alone. I have none but myself. I belong to no army.\"\n",
                "\"Thou art not alone, and thou dost not belong to thyself. Thou art one\nof My voices, thou art one of My arms. Speak and strike for Me. But if\nthe arm be broken, or the voice be weary, then still I hold My ground: I\nfight with other voices, other arms than thine. Though thou art\nconquered, yet art thou of the army which is never vanquished. Remember\nthat and thou wilt fight even unto death.\"\n",
                "\"Lord, I have suffered much!\"\n",
                "\"Thinkest thou that I do not suffer also? For ages death has hunted Me\nand nothingness has lain in wait for Me. It is only by victory in the\nfight that I can make My way. The river of life is red with My blood.\"\n",
                "\"Fighting, always fighting?\"\n",
                "\"We must always fight. God is a fighter, even He Himself. God is a\nconqueror. He is a devouring lion. Nothingness hems Him in and He hurls\nit down. And the rhythm of the fight is the supreme harmony. Such\nharmony is not for thy mortal ears. It is enough for thee to know that\nit exists. Do thy duty in peace and leave the rest to the Gods.\"\n",
                "\"I have no strength left.\"\n",
                "\"Sing for those who are strong.\"\n",
                "\"My voice is gone.\"\n",
                "\"Pray.\"\n",
                "\"My heart is foul.\"\n",
                "\"Pluck it out. Take Mine.\"\n",
                "\"Lord, it is easy to forget myself, to cast away my dead soul. But how\ncan I cast out the dead? how can I forget those whom I have loved?\"\n",
                "\"Abandon the dead with thy dead soul. Thou wilt find them alive with My\nliving soul.\"\n",
                "\"Thou hast left me once: wilt Thou leave me again?\"\n",
                "\"I shall leave thee again. Never doubt that. It is for thee never to\nleave Me more.\"\n",
                "\"But if the flame of my life dies down?\"\n",
                "\"Then do thou kindle others.\"\n",
                "\"And if death is in me?\"\n",
                "\"Life is otherwhere. Go, open thy gates to life. Thou insensate man, to\nshut thyself up in thy ruined house! Quit thyself. There are other\nmansions.\"\n",
                "\"O Life, O Life! I see ... I sought thee in myself, in my own empty\nshut-in soul. My soul is broken: the sweet air pours in through the\nwindows of my wounds: I breathe again, I have found Thee once more, O\nLife!...\"\n",
                "\"I have found thee again.... Hold thy peace, and listen.\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "And like the murmuring of a spring, Christophe heard the song of life\nbubbling up in him. Leaning out of his window, he saw the forest, which\nyesterday had been dead, seething with life under the sun and the wind,\nheaving like the Ocean. Along the stems of the trees, like thrills of\njoy, the waves of the wind passed: and the yielding branches held their\narms in ecstasy up to the brilliant sky. And the torrent rang out\nmerrily as a bell. The countryside had risen from the grave in which\nyesterday it had been entombed: life had entered it at the time when\nlove passed into Christophe's heart. Oh! the miracle of the soul touched\nby grace, awaking to new life! Then everything comes to life again all\nround it. The heart begins to beat once more. The eye of the spirit is\nopened. The dried-up fountains begin once more to flow.\n",
                "And Christophe returned to the Divine conflict.... How his own fight,\nhow all the conflicts of men were lost in that gigantic battle, wherein\nthe suns rain down like flakes of snow tossing on the wind!... He had\nlaid bare his soul. And, just as in those dreams in which one hovers in\nspace, he felt that he was soaring above himself, he saw himself from\nabove, in the general plan of the world; and the meaning of his efforts,\nthe price of his suffering, were revealed to him at a glance. His\nstruggles were a part of the great fight of the worlds. His overthrow\nwas a momentary episode, immediately repaired. Just as he fought for\nall, so all fought for him. They shared his trials, he shared their\nglory.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "\"Companions, enemies, walk over me, crush me, let me feel the cannons\nwhich shall win victory pass over my body! I do not think of the iron\nwhich cuts deep into my flesh, I do not think of the foot that tramples\ndown my head, I think of my Avenger, the Master, the Leader of the\ncountless army. My blood shall cement the victory of the future....\"\n",
                "God was not to him the impassive Creator, a Nero from his tower of brass\nwatching the burning of the City to which he himself has set fire. God\nwas fighting. God was suffering. Fighting and suffering with all who\nfight and for all who suffer. For God was Life, the drop of light fallen\ninto the darkness, spreading out, reaching out, drinking up the night.\nBut the night is limitless, and the Divine struggle will never cease:\nand none can know how it will end. It was a heroic symphony wherein the\nvery discords clashed together and mingled and grew into a serene whole!\nJust as the beech-forest in silence furiously wages war, so Life carries\nwar into the eternal peace.\n",
                "The wars and the peace rang echoing through Christophe. He was like a\nshell wherein the ocean roars. Epic shouts passed, and trumpet calls,\nand tempestuous sounds borne upon sovereign rhythms. For in that\nsonorous soul everything took shape in sound. It sang of light. It sang\nof darkness, sang of life and death. It sang for those who were\nvictorious in battle. It sang for himself who was conquered and laid\nlow. It sang. All was song. It was nothing but song.\n",
                "It was so drunk with it that it could not hear its own song. Like the\nspring rains, the torrents of music disappeared into the earth that was\ncracked by the winter. Shame, grief, bitterness now revealed their\nmysterious mission: they had decomposed the earth and they had\nfertilized it. The share of sorrow, breaking the heart, had opened up\nnew sources of life. The waste land had once more burst into flower. But\nthey were not the old spring flowers. A new soul had been born.\n",
                "Every moment it was springing into birth. For it was not yet shaped and\nhardened, like the souls that have come to the end of their belief, the\nsouls which are at the point of death. It was not the finished statue.\nIt was molten metal. Every second made a new universe of it. Christophe\nhad no thought of setting bounds upon himself. He gave himself up to the\njoy of a man leaving behind him the burden of his past and setting out\non a long voyage, with youth in his blood, freedom in his heart, to\nbreathe the sea air, and think that the voyage will never come to an\nend. Now that he was caught up again by the creative force which flows\nthrough the world, he was amazed to the point of ecstasy at the world's\nwealth. He loved, he _was_, his neighbor as himself. And all things\nwere \"neighbors\" to him, from the grass beneath his feet to the man\nwhose hand he clasped. A fine tree, the shadow of a cloud on the\nmountain, the breath of the fields borne upward on the wind, and, at\nnight, the hive of heaven buzzing with the swarming suns ... his blood\nraced through him ... he had no desire to speak or to think, he desired\nonly to laugh and to cry, and to melt away into the living marvel of it\nall. Write? Why should he write? Can a man write the inexpressible?...\nBut whether it were possible or no, he had to write. It was his law.\nIdeas would come to him in flashes, wherever he might be, most often\nwhen he was out walking. He could not wait. Then he would write with\nanything, on anything that came to hand: and very often he could not\nhave told the meaning of the phrases which came rushing forth from him\nwith irresistible impetuosity: and, as he wrote, more ideas would come,\nmore and more: and he would write and write, on his shirt cuffs, in the\nlining of his hat. Quickly though he wrote, yet his thoughts would leap\nahead, and he had to use a sort of shorthand.\n",
                "They were only rough notes. The difficulty began when he tried to turn\nhis ideas into the ordinary musical forms: he discovered that none of\nthe conventional molds were in the least suitable: if he wanted to fix\nhis visions with any sort of fidelity, he had to begin by forgetting all\nthe music he had ever heard, everything he had ever written, make a\nclean sweep of all the formulae he had ever learned, and the traditional\ntechnique; fling away all such crutches of the impotent mind, the\ncomfortable bed made for the indolence of those who lie back on the\nthoughts of other men to save themselves the trouble of thinking for\nthemselves. A short while ago, when he thought that he had reached\nmaturity in life and art--(as a matter of fact he had only been at the\nend of one of his lives and one of his incarnations in art),--he had\nexpressed himself in a preexisting language: his feelings had submitted\nwithout revolt to the logic of a pre-established development, which\ndictated a portion of his phrases in advance, and had led him, docilely\nenough, along the beaten track to the appointed spot where the public\nwas awaiting him. Now there was no road marked out, and his feelings had\nto carve out their own path: his mind had only to follow. It was no\nlonger appointed to describe or to analyze passion: it had to become\npart and parcel of it, and seek to wed its inward law.\n",
                "At the same time he shed all the contradictions in which he had long\nbeen involved, though he had never willingly submitted to them. For,\nalthough he was a pure artist, he had often incorporated in his art\nconsiderations which are foreign to art: he had endowed it with a social\nmission. And he had not perceived that there were two men in him: the\ncreative artist who never worried himself about any moral aim, and the\nman of action, the thinker, who wanted his art to be moral and social.\nThe two would sometimes bring each other to an awkward pass. But now\nthat he was subject to every creative idea, with its organic law, like a\nreality superior to all reality, he had broken free of practical reason.\nIn truth, he shed none of his contempt for the flabby and depraved\nimmorality of the age: in truth, he still thought that its impure and\nunwholesome art was the lowest rung of art, because it is a disease, a\nfungus growing on a rotting trunk: but if art for pleasure's sake is the\nprostration of art, Christophe by no means opposed to it the\nshort-sighted utilitarianism of art for morality's sake, that winged\nPegasus harnessed to the plow. The highest art, the only art which is\nworthy of the name, is above all temporary laws: it is a comet sweeping\nthrough the infinite. It may be that its force is useful, it may be that\nit is apparently useless and dangerous in the existing order of the\nworkaday world: but it is force, it is movement and fire: it is the\nlightning darted from heaven: and, for that very reason, it is sacred,\nfor that very reason it is beneficent. The good it does may be of the\npractical order: but its real, its Divine benefits are, like faith, of\nthe supernatural order. It is like the sun whence it is sprung. The sun\nis neither moral nor immoral. It is that which Is. It lightens the\ndarkness of space. And so does art.\n",
                "And Christophe, being delivered up to art, was amazed to find unknown\nand unsuspected powers teeming in himself: powers quite apart from his\npassions, his sorrows, his conscious soul, a stranger soul, indifferent\nto all his loves and sufferings, to all his life, a joyous, fantastic,\nwild, incomprehensible soul. It rode him and dug its spurs into his\nsides. And, in the rare moments when he could stop to take breath, he\nwondered as he read over what he had written:\n",
                "\"How could such things have come out of me?\"\n",
                "He was a prey to that delirium of the mind which is known to every man\nof genius, that will which is independent of the will, _\"the ineffable\nenigma of the world and life\"_ which Goethe calls _\"the demoniac,\"_\nagainst which he was always armed, though it always overcame him.\n",
                "And Christophe wrote and wrote. For days and weeks. There are times when\nthe mind, being impregnated, can feed upon itself and go on producing\nalmost indefinitely. The faintest contact with things, the pollen of a\nflower borne by the wind were enough to make the inward germs, the\nmyriads of germs put forth and come to blossom. Christophe had no time\nto think, no time to live. His creative soul reigned sovereign over the\nruins of his life.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "And suddenly it stopped. Christophe came out of that state broken,\nscorched, older by ten years--but saved. He had left Christophe and gone\nover to God.\n",
                "Streaks of white hair had suddenly appeared in his black mane, like\nthose autumn flowers which spring up in the fields in September nights.\nThere were fresh lines on his cheeks. But his eyes had regained their\ncalm expression, and his mouth bore the marks of resignation. He was\nappeased. He understood now. He understood the vanity of his pride, the\nvanity of human pride, under the terrible hand of the Force which moves\nthe worlds. No man is surely master of himself. A man must watch. For if\nhe slumbers that Force rushes into him and whirls him headlong ... into\nwhat dread abysses? or the torrent which bears him along sinks and\nleaves him on its dry bed. To fight the fight it is not enough to will.\nA man must humiliate himself before the unknown God, who _fiat ubi\nvult_, who blows where and when He listeth, love, death, or life.\nHuman will can do nothing without God's. One second is enough for Him to\nobliterate the work of years of toil and effort. And, if it so please\nHim, He can cause the eternal to spring forth from dust and mud. No man\nmore than the creative artist feels at the mercy of God: for, if he is\ntruly great, he will only say what the Spirit bids him.\n",
                "And Christophe understood the wisdom of old Haydn who went down on his\nknees each morning before he took pen in hand.... _Vigila et ora_.\nWatch and pray. Pray to God that He may be with you. Keep in loving and\npious communion with the Spirit of life.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Towards the end of summer a Parisian friend of Christophe's, who was\npassing through Switzerland, discovered his retreat. He was a musical\ncritic who in old days had been an excellent judge of his compositions.\nHe was accompanied by a well-known painter, who was avowedly a\nwhole-hearted admirer of Christophe's. They told him of the very\nconsiderable success of his work, which was being played all over\nEurope. Christophe showed very little interest in the news: the past was\ndead to him, and his old compositions did not count. At his visitors'\nrequest he showed them the music he had written recently. The critic\ncould make nothing of it. He thought Christophe had gone mad.\n",
                "\"No melody, no measure, no thematic workmanship: a sort of liquid core,\nmolten matter which had not hardened, taking any shape, but possessing\nnone of its own: it is like nothing on earth: a glimmering of light in\nchaos.\"\n",
                "Christophe smiled:\n",
                "\"It is quite like that,\" he said. \"The eyes of chaos shining through the\nveil of order....\"\n",
                "But the critic did not understand Novalis' words:\n",
                "(\"He is cleaned out,\" he thought.)\n",
                "Christophe did not try to make him understand.\n",
                "When his visitors were ready to go he walked with them a little, so as\nto do the honors of his mountain. But he did not go far. Looking down at\na field, the musical critic called to mind the scenery of a Parisian\ntheater: and the painter criticised the colors, mercilessly remarking on\nthe awkwardness of their combination, and declaring that to him they had\na Swiss flavor, sour, like rhubarb, musty and dull, _\u00e0 la_ Hodler;\nfurther, he displayed an indifference to Nature which was not altogether\naffectation. He pretended to ignore Nature.\n",
                "\"Nature! What on earth is Nature? I don't know. Light, color, very well!\nBut I don't care a hang for Nature!\"\n",
                "Christophe shook hands with them and let them go. That sort of thing had\nno effect on him now. They were on the other side of the ravine. That\nwas well. He said to nobody in particular:\n",
                "\"If you wish to come up to me, you must take the same road.\"\n",
                "The creative fire which had been burning for months had died down. But\nits comfortable warmth was still in Christophe's heart. He knew that the\nfire would flare up again: if not in himself, then around him. Wherever\nit might be, he would love it just the same: it would always be the same\nfire. On that September evening he could feel it burning throughout all\nNature.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He climbed up to the house. There had been a storm. The sun had come out\nagain. The fields were steaming. The ripe fruit was falling from the\napple-trees into the wet grass. Spiders' webs, hanging from the branches\nof the trees, still glittering with the rain, were like the ancient\nwheels of Mycenaean chariots. At the edge of the dripping forest the\ngreen woodpecker was trilling his jerky laughter; and myriads of little\nwasps, dancing in the sunbeams, filled the vault of the woods with their\ndeep, long-drawn organ note.\n",
                "Christophe came to a clearing, in the hollow of a shoulder of the\nmountain, a little valley shut in at both ends, a perfect oval in shape,\nwhich was flooded with the light of the setting sun: the earth was red:\nin the midst lay a little golden field of belated crops, and\nrust-colored rushes. Round about it was a girdle of the woods with their\nripe autumn tints: ruddy copper beeches, pale yellow chestnuts, rowans\nwith their coral berries, flaming cherry-trees with their little tongues\nof fire, myrtle-bushes with their leaves of orange and lemon and brown\nand burnt tinder. It was like a burning bush. And from the heart of the\nflaring cup rose and soared a lark, drunk with the berries and the sun.\n",
                "And Christophe's soul was like the lark. It knew that it would soon come\ndown to earth again, and many times. But it knew also that it would\nunwearyingly ascend in the fire, singing its \"tirra-lirra\" which tells\nof the light of the heavens to those who are on earth below.\n"

I cast it from me\nlike an empty shell. Life is a succession of deaths and resurrections.\nWe must die, Christophe, to be born again,\n",

The whole visible world of form\nis forever wearing out and springing to new life. Thou only dost not\npass, immortal music. Thou art the inward sea. Thou art the profound\ndepths of the soul. In thy clear eyes the scowling face of life is not\nmirrored. Far, far from thee, like the herded clouds, flies the\nprocession of days, burning, icy, feverish, driven by uneasiness,\nhuddling, moving on, on, never for one moment to endure.

I lay my\nburning eyelids upon the cool palms of thy hands.

                "Christophe loses count of the fleeting years. Drop by drop life ebbs\naway. But _his_ life is elsewhere. It has no history. His history\nlies wholly in his creative work. The unceasing buzzing song of music\nfills his soul, and makes him insensible to the outward tumult.\n",
                "Christophe has conquered. His name has been forced upon the world. He is\nageing. His hair is white. That is nothing to him, his heart is ever\nyoung: he has surrendered none of his force, none of his faith. Once\nmore he is calm, but not as he was before he passed by the Burning Bush.\nIn the depths of his soul there is still the quivering of the storm, the\nmemory of his glimpse into the abyss of the raging seas. He knows that\nno man may boast of being master of himself without the permission of\nthe God of battle. In his soul there are two souls. One is a high\nplateau swept by winds and shrouded with, clouds. The other, higher\nstill, is a snowy peak bathed in light. There it is impossible to dwell;\nbut, when he is frozen by the mists on the lower ground, well he knows\nthe path that leads to the sun. In his misty soul Christophe is not\nalone. Near him he ever feels the presence of an invisible friend, the\nsturdy Saint Cecilia, listening with wide, calm eyes to the heavens;\nand, like the Apostle Paul,--in Raphael's picture,--silent and\ndreaming, leaning on his sword, he is beyond exasperation, and has no\nthought of fighting: he dreams, and forges his dreams into form.\n",
                "During this period of his life he mostly wrote piano and chamber music.\nIn such work he was more free to dare and be bold: it necessitated fewer\nintermediaries between his ideas and their realization; his ideas were\nless in danger of losing force in the course of their percolation.\nFrescobaldi, Couperin, Schubert, and Chopin, in their boldness of\nexpression and style, anticipated the revolutionaries in orchestral\nmusic by fifty years. Out of the crude stuff shaped by Christophe's\nstrong hands came strange and unknown agglomerations of harmony,\nbewildering combinations of chords, begotten of the remotest kinships of\nsounds accessible to the senses in these days; they cast a magical and\nholy spell upon the mind.--But the public must have time to grow\naccustomed to the conquests and the trophies which a great artist brings\nback with him from his quest in the deep waters of the ocean. Very few\nwould follow Christophe in the temerity of his later works. His fame was\ndue to his earlier compositions. The feeling of not being understood,\nwhich is even more painful in success than in the lack of it, because\nthere seems to be no way out of it, had, since the death of his only\nfriend, aggravated in Christophe his rather morbid tendency to seek\nisolation from the world.\n",
                "However, the gates of Germany were open to him once more. In France the\ntragic brawl had been forgotten. He was free to go whithersoever he\npleased. But he was afraid of the memories that would lie in wait for\nhim in Paris. And, although he had spent a few months in Germany and\nreturned there from time to time to conduct performances of his work, he\ndid not settle there. He found too many things which hurt him. They were\nnot particular to Germany: he found them elsewhere. But a man expects\nmore of his own country than any other, and he suffers more from its\nfoibles. It was true, too, that Germany was bearing the greatest burden\nof the sins of Europe. The victor incurs the responsibility of his\nvictory, a debt towards the vanquished: tacitly the victor is pledged to\nmarch in front of them to show them the way. The conquests of Louis XIV.\ngave Europe the splendor of French reason. What light has the Germany of\nSedan given to the world? The glitter of bayonets? Thought without\nwings, action without generosity, brutal realism, which has not even the\nexcuse of being the realism of healthy men; force and interest: Mars\nturned bagman. Forty years ago Europe was led astray into the night, and\nthe terrors of the night. The sun was hidden beneath the conqueror's\nhelmet. If the vanquished are too weak to raise the extinguisher, and\ncan claim only pity mingled with contempt, what shall be given to the\nvictor who has done this thing?\n",
                "A little while ago, day began to peep: little shafts of light shimmered\nthrough the cracks. Being one of the first to see the rising of the sun,\nChristophe had come out of the shadow of the helmet: gladly he returned\nto the country in which he had been a sojourner perforce, to\nSwitzerland. Like so many of the spirits of that time, spirits thirsting\nfor liberty, choking in the narrowing circle of the hostile nations, he\nsought a corner of the earth in which he could stand above Europe and\nbreathe freely. Formerly, in the days of Goethe, the Rome of the free\nPopes was the island upon which all the winged thought of divers nations\ncame to rest, like birds taking shelter from the storm. Now what refuge\nis there? The island has been covered by the sea. Rome is no more. The\nbirds have fled from the Seven Hills.--The Alps only are left for them.\nThere, amid the rapacity of Europe, stands (for how long?) the little\nisland of twenty-four cantons. In truth it has not the poetic radiance\nand glamor of the Eternal City: history has not filled its air with the\nbreath of gods and heroes; but a mighty music rises from the naked\nEarth; there is an heroic rhythm in the lines of the mountains, and\nhere, more than anywhere else, a man can feel himself in contact with\nelemental forces. Christophe did not go there in search of romantic\npleasure. A field, a few trees, a stream, the wide sky, were enough to\nmake him feel alive. The calm aspect of his native country was sweeter\nand more companionable to him than the gigantic grandeur of the Alps.\nBut he could not forget that it was here that he had renewed his\nstrength: here God had appeared to him in the Burning Bush; and he never\nreturned thither without a thrill of gratitude and faith. He was not the\nonly one. How many of the combatants of life, ground beneath life's\nheel, have on that soil renewed their energy to turn again to the fight,\nand believe once more in its purpose!\n",
                "Living in that country he had come to know it well. The majority of\nthose who pass through it see only its excrescences: the leprosy of the\nhotels which defiles the fairest features of that sturdy piece of earth,\nthe stranger cities, the monstrous marts whither all the fatted people\nof the world come to browse, the _table d'h\u00f4te_ meals, the masses\nof food flung into the trough for the nosing beasts: the casino bands\nwith their silly music mingling with the noise of the little horses, the\nItalian scum whose disgusting uproar makes the bored wealthy idiots\nwriggle with pleasure, the fatuous display of the shops--wooden bears,\nchalets, silly knick-knacks, always the same, repeated time and again,\nover and over again, with no freshness or invention; the worthy\nbooksellers with their scandalous pamphlets,--all the moral baseness of\nthose places whither every year the idle, joyless millions come who are\nincapable of finding amusement in the smallest degree finer than that of\nthe multitude, or one tithe as keen.\n",
                "And they know nothing of the people in whose land they stay. They have\nno notion of the reserves of moral force and civic liberty which for\ncenturies have been hoarded up in them, coals of the fires of Calvin and\nZwingli, still glowing beneath the ashes; they have no conception of the\nvigorous democratic spirit which will always ignore the Napoleonic\nRepublic, of the simplicity of their institutions, or the breadth of\ntheir social undertakings, or the example given to the world by these\nUnited States of the three great races of the West, the model of the\nEurope of the future. Even less do they know of the Daphne concealed\nbeneath this rugged bark, the wild, flashing dreams of Boecklin, the\nraucous heroism of Hodler, the serene vision and humor of Gottfried\nKeller, the living tradition of the great popular festivals, and the sap\nof springtime swelling the trees,--the still young art, sometimes\nrasping to the palate, like the hard fruits of wild pear-trees,\nsometimes with the sweetish insipidity of myrtles black and blue, but at\nleast something smacking of the earth, is the work of self-taught men\nnot cut off from the people by an archaic culture, but, with them,\nreading in the same book of life.\n",
                "Christophe was in sympathy with these men who strive less to seem than\nto be, and, under the recent veneer of an ultramodern industrialism,\nkeep clearly marked the most reposeful features of the old Europe of\npeasants and townsmen. Among them he had found a few good friends,\ngrave, serious, and faithful, who hold isolated and immured in them\nregrets for the past; they were looking on at the gradual disappearance\nof the old Switzerland with a sort of religious fatalism and Calvinistic\npessimism; great gray souls. Christophe seldom saw them. His old wounds\nwere apparently healed: but they had been too deep wholly to be cured.\nHe was fearful of forming new ties with men. It was something for this\nreason that he liked to dwell in a country where it was easy to live\napart, a stranger amid a throng of strangers. For the rest he rarely\nstayed long in any one place; often he changed his lair: he was like an\nold migratory bird which needs space, and has its country in the air ...\n_\"Mein Reich ist in der Luft.\"_\n",
                "An evening in summer.\n",
                "He was walking in the mountains above a village. He was striding along\nwith his hat in his hand, up a winding road. He came to a neck where the\nroad took a double turn, and passed into shadow between two slopes; on\neither side were nut-trees and pines. It was like a little shut-in\nworld. On either hand the road seemed to come to an end, cut off at the\nedge of the void. Beyond were blue distance and the gleaming air. The\npeace of evening came down like a gentle rain.\n",
                "They came together each at the same moment turning the bend at either\nend of the neck. She was dressed in black, and stood out against the\nclear sky: behind her were two children, a boy and a girl, between six\nand eight, who were playing and picking flowers. They recognized each\nother at a distance of a few yards. Their emotion was visible in their\neyes; but neither brought it into words; each gave only an imperceptible\nmovement. He was deeply moved: she ... her lips trembled a little. They\nstopped. Almost in a whisper:\n",
                "\"Grazia!\"\n",
                "\"You here!\"\n",
                "They held out their hands and stood without a word. Grazia was the first\nto make an effort to break the silence. She told him where she lived,\nand asked him where he was staying. Question and answer were mechanical,\nand they hardly listened, heard later, when their hands had parted: they\nwere absorbed in gazing at each other. The children came back to her.\nShe introduced them. He felt hostile towards them, and looked at them\nwith no kindness, and said nothing: he was engrossed with her, occupied\nonly in studying her beautiful face that bore some marks of suffering\nand age. She was embarrassed by his gaze, and said:\n",
                "\"Will you come, this evening?\"\n",
                "And she gave the name of her hotel.\n",
                "He asked her where her husband was. She pointed to her black dress. He\nwas too much moved to say more, and left her awkwardly. But when he had\ntaken a few strides he came back to the children, who were picking\nstrawberries, and took them roughly in his arms and kissed them, and\nwent away.\n",
                "In the evening he went to the hotel, and found her on the veranda, with\nthe blinds drawn. They sat apart. There were very few people about, only\ntwo or three old people. Christophe was irritated by their presence.\nGrazia looked at him, and he looked at her, and murmured her name over\nand over again.\n",
                "\"Don't you think I have changed?\" she asked.\n",
                "His heart grew big.\n",
                "\"You have suffered,\" he said.\n",
                "\"You too,\" she answered pityingly, scanning the deep marks of agony and\npassion in his face.\n",
                "They were at a loss for words.\n",
                "\"Please,\" he said, a moment later, \"let us go somewhere else. Could we\nnot find somewhere to be alone and talk?\"\n",
                "\"No, my dear. Let us stay here. It is good enough here. No one is\nheeding us at all.\"\n",
                "\"I cannot talk freely here.\"\n",
                "\"That is all the better.\"\n",
                "He could not understand why. Later, when in memory he went over their\nconversation, he thought she had not trusted him. But she was\ninstinctively afraid of emotional scenes: unconsciously she was seeking\nprotection from any surprise of their hearts: the very awkwardness of\ntheir intimacy in a public room, so sheltering the modesty of her secret\nemotions, was dear to her.\n",
                "In whispers, with long intervals of silence, they sketched their lives\nin outline. Count Ber\u00e9ny had been killed in a duel a few months ago; and\nChristophe saw that she had not been very happy with him. Also, she had\nlost a child, her first-born. She made no complaint, and turned the\nconversation from herself to question Christophe, and, as he told her of\nhis tribulations, she showed the most affectionate compassion. Bells\nrang. It was Sunday evening. Life stood still.\n",
                "She asked him to come again next day but one. He was hurt that she\nshould be so little eager to see him again. In his heart happiness and\nsorrow were mingled.\n",
                "Next day, on some pretext, she wrote and asked him to come. He was\ndelighted with her little note. This time she received him in her\nprivate room. She was with her two children. He looked at them, still a\nlittle uneasily, but very tenderly. He thought the little girl--the\nelder of the two--very like her mother: but he did not try to match the\nboy's looks. They talked about the country, the times, the books lying\nopen on the table:--but their eyes spoke of other things. He was hoping\nto be able to talk more intimately when a hotel acquaintance came in. He\nmarked the pleasure and politeness with which Grazia received the\nstranger: she seemed to make no difference between her two visitors. He\nwas hurt by it, but could not be angry with her. She proposed that they\nshould all go for a walk and he accepted; the presence of the other woman,\nthough she was young and charming, paralyzed him: his day was spoiled.\n",
                "He did not see Grazia again for two days. During that time he lived but\nfor the hours he was to spend with her.--Once more his efforts to speak\nto her were doomed to failure. While she was very gentle and kind with\nhim, she could not throw off her reserve. All unconsciously Christophe\nadded to her difficulty by his outbursts of German sentimentality, which\nembarrassed her and forced her instinct into reaction.\n",
                "He wrote her a letter which touched her, saying that life was so short!\nTheir lives were already so far gone! Perhaps they would have only a\nvery little time in which to see each other, and it was pitiful, almost\ncriminal, not to employ it in frank converse.\n",
                "She replied with a few affectionate words, begging him to excuse her for\nher distrust, which she could not avoid, since she had been so much hurt\nby life: she could not break her habitual reserve: any excessive\ndisplay, even of a genuine feeling, hurt and terrified her. But well she\nknew the worth of the friendship that had come to her once more: and she\nwas as glad of it as he. She asked him to dine with her that evening.\n",
                "His heart was brimming with gratitude. In his room, lying on his bed, he\nsobbed. It was the opening of the flood-gates of ten years of solitude:\nfor, since Olivier's death, he had been utterly alone. Her letter gave\nthe word of resurrection to his heart that was so famished for\ntenderness. Tenderness!... He thought he had put it from him: he had\nbeen forced to learn how to do without it! Now he felt how sorely he\nneeded it, and the great stores of love that had accumulated in him....\n",
                "It was a sweet and blessed evening that they spent together.... He\ncould only speak to her of trivial subjects, in spite of their intention\nto hide nothing from each other. But what goodly things he told her\nthrough the piano, which with her eyes she invited him to use to tell\nher what he had to say! She was struck by the humility of the man whom\nshe had known in his violence and pride. When he went away the silent\npressure of their hands told them that they had found each other, and\nwould never lose what they had regained.--It was raining, and there was\nnot a breath of wind. His heart was singing.\n",
                "She was only able to stay a few days longer, and she did not postpone\nher departure for an hour. He dared not ask her to do so, nor complain.\nOn their last day they went for a walk with the children; there came a\nmoment when he was so full of love and happiness that he tried to tell\nher so: but, with a very gentle gesture, she stopped him and smiled:\n",
                "\"Hush! I feel everything that you could say.\"\n",
                "They sat down at the turn of the road where they had met. Still smiling\nshe looked down into the valley below: but it was not the valley that\nshe saw. He looked at the gentle face marked with the traces of bitter\nsuffering: a few white tresses showed in her thick black hair. He was\nfilled with a pitying, passionate adoration of this beloved creature who\nhad travailed and been impregnated with the suffering of the soul. In\nevery one of the marks of time upon her the soul was visible.--And, in a\nlow, trembling voice, he craved, as a precious favor, which she granted\nhim, a white hair from her head.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "She went away. He could not understand why she would not have him\naccompany her. He had no doubt of her feeling for him, but her reserve\ndisconcerted him. He could not stay alone in that place, and set out in\nanother direction. He tried to occupy his mind with traveling and work.\nHe wrote to Grazia. She answered him, two or three week later, with\nvery brief letters, in which she showed her tranquil friendship, knowing\nneither impatience nor uneasiness. They hurt him and he loved them. He\nwould not admit that he had any right to reproach her; their affection\nwas too recent, too recently renewed. He was fearful of losing it. And\nyet every letter he had from her breathed a calm loyalty which should\nhave made him feel secure. But she was so different from him!...\n",
                "They had agreed to meet in Rome, towards the end of the autumn. Without\nthe thought of seeing her, the journey would have had little charm for\nChristophe. His long isolation had made him retiring: he had no taste\nfor that futile hurrying from place to place which is so dear to the\nindolence of modern men and women. He was fearful of a change of habit,\nwhich is dangerous to the regular work of the mind. Besides, Italy had\nno attractions for him. He knew it only in the villainous music of the\nVerists and the tenor arias to which every now and then the land of\nVirgil inspires men of letters on their travels. He felt towards Italy\nthe hostility of an advanced artist, who has too often heard the name of\nRome invoked by the worst champions of academic routine. Finally, the\nold leaven of instinctive antipathy which ever lies fermenting in the\nhearts of the men of the North towards the men of the South, or at least\ntowards the legendary type of rhetorical braggart which, in the eyes of\nthe men of the North, represents the men of the South. At the mere\nthought of it Christophe disdainfully curled his lip.... No, he had no\ndesire for the more acquaintance of the musicless people--(for, in the\nmusic of modern Europe, what is the place of their mandolin tinkling and\nmelodramatic posturing declamation?).--And yet Grazia belonged to this\npeople. To join her again, whither and by what devious ways would\nChristophe not have gone? He would win through by shutting his eyes\nuntil he came to her.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He was used to shutting his eyes. For so many years the shutters of his\nsoul had been closed upon his inward life. Now, in this late autumn, it\nwas more necessary than ever. For three weeks together it had rained\nincessantly. Then a gray pall of impenetrable mists had hung over the\nvalleys and towns of Switzerland, dripping and wet. His eyes had\nforgotten the sunlight. To rediscover in himself its concentrated energy\nhe had to begin by clothing himself in night, and, with his eyes closed,\nto descend to the depths of the mine, the subterranean galleries of his\ndreams. There in the seams of coal slept the sun of days gone by. But as\nthe result of spending his life crouching there, digging, he came out\nburned, stiff in back and knees, with limbs deformed, half petrified,\ndazed eyes, that, like a bird's, could see keenly in the night. Many a\ntime Christophe had brought up from the mine the fire he had so\npainfully extracted to warm the chill of heart. But the dreams of the\nNorth smack of the warmth of the fireside and the closed room. No man\nnotices it while he lives in it: dear is that heavy air, dear the\nhalf-light and the soul's dreams in the drowsy head. We love the things\nwe have. We must be satisfied with them!...\n",
                "When, as he passed the barrier of the Alps, Christophe, dozing in a\ncorner of the carriage, saw the stainless sky and the limpid light\nfalling upon the slopes of the mountains, he thought he must be\ndreaming. On the other side of the wall he had left a darkened sky and a\nfading day. So sudden was the change that at first he felt more surprise\nthan joy. It was some time before his drowsy soul awoke and began slowly\nto expand and burst the crust that was upon it, and his heart could free\nitself from the shadows of the past. But as the day wore on, the mellow\nlight took his soul into its arms, and, wholly forgetting all that had\nbeen, he drank greedily of the delight of seeing.\n",
                "Through the plains of Milan. The eye of day mirrored in the blue canals,\na network of veins through the downy rice fields. Mountains of Vinci,\nsnowy Alps soft in their brilliance, ruggedly encircling the horizon,\nfringed with red and orange and greeny gold and pale blue. Evening\nfalling on the Apennines. A winding descent by little sheer hills,\nsnakelike curving, in a repeating, involved rhythm like a\nfarandole.--And suddenly, at the bottom of the slope, like a kiss, the\nbreath of the sea and the smell of orange-trees. The sea, the Latin sea\nand its opal light, whereon, swaying, were the sails of little boats\nlike wings folded back....\n",
                "By the sea, at a fishing-village, the train stopped for a while. It was\nexplained to the passengers that there had been a landslip, as a result\nof the heavy rains, in a tunnel between Genoa and Pisa: all the trains\nwere several hours late. Christophe, who was booked through to Rome,\nwas delighted by the accident which provoked the loud lamentations of\nhis fellow-passengers. He jumped down to the platform and made use of\nthe stoppage to go down to the sea, which drew him on and on. The sea\ncharmed him so that when, a few hours later, the engine whistled as it\nmoved on, Christophe was in a boat, and, as the train passed, shouted:\n\"Good-by!\" In the luminous night, on the luminous sea, he sat rocking in\nthe boat, as it passed along the scented coast with its promontories\nfringed with tiny cypress-trees. He put up at a village and spent there\nfive days of unbroken joy. He was like a man issuing from a long fast,\nhungrily eating. With all his famished senses he gulped down the\nsplendid light.... Light, the blood of the world, that flows in space\nlike a river of life, and through our eyes, our lips, our nostrils,\nevery pore of our skins, filters through to the depths of our bodies,\nlight, more necessary to life than bread,--he who sees thee stripped of\nthy northern veils, pure, burning, naked, marvels how ever he could have\nlived without knowing thee, and deeply feels that he can never live more\nwithout possessing thee....\n",
                "For five days Christophe was drunk with the sun. For five days he\nforgot--for the first time--that he was a musician. The music of his\nsoul was merged into light. The air, the sea, the earth: the brilliant\nsymphony played by the sun's orchestra. And with what innate art does\nItaly know how to use that orchestra! Other peoples paint from Nature:\nthe Italians collaborate with her: they paint with sunlight. The music\nof color. All is music, everything sings. A wall by the roadside, red,\nfissured with gold: above it, two cypress-trees with their tufted\ncrests: and all around the eager blue of the sky. A marble staircase,\nwhite, steep, narrow, climbing between pink walls against the blue front\nof a church. Any one of their many-colored houses, apricot, lemon,\ncedrate, shining among the olive-trees, has the effect of a marvelous\nripe fruit among the leaves. In Italy seeing is sensual: the eyes enjoy\ncolor, as the palate and the tongue delight in a juicy, scented fruit.\nChristophe flung himself at this new repast with eager childlike greed:\nhe made up for the asceticism of the gray visions to which till then he\nhad been condemned. His abounding nature, stifled by Fate, suddenly\nbecame conscious of powers of enjoyment which he had never used: they\npounced on the prey presented to them; scents, colors, the music of\nvoices, bells and the sea, the kisses of the air, the warm bath of light\nin which his ageing, weary soul began to expand.... Christophe had no\nthought of anything. He was in a state of beatific delight, and only\nleft it to share his joy with those he met: his boatman, an old\nfisherman, with quick eyes all wrinkled round, who wore a red cap like\nthat of a Venetian senator;--his only fellow-boarder, a Milanese, who\nate macaroni and rolled his eyes like Othello: fierce black eyes filled\nwith a furious hatred; an apathetic, sleepy man;--the waiter in the\nrestaurant, who, when he carried a tray, bent his neck, and twisted his\narms and his body like an angel of Bernini;--the little Saint John, with\nsly, winking eyes, who begged on the road, and offered the passers-by an\norange on a green branch. He would hail the carriage-drivers, sitting\nhuddled on their seats, who every now and then would, in a nasal,\ndroning, throaty voice, intone the thousand and one couplets. He was\namazed to find himself humming _Cavalleria Rusticana_. He had\nentirely forgotten the end of his journey. Forgotten, too, was his haste\nto reach the end and Grazia....\n",
                "Forgotten altogether was she until the day when the beloved image rose\nbefore him. Was it called up by a face seen on the road or a grave,\nsinging note in a voice? He did not know. But a time came when, from\neverything about him, from the circling, olive-clad hills, from the\nhigh, shining peaks of the Apennines, graven by the dense shadows and\nthe burning sun, and from the orange-groves heavy with flowers and\nfruit, and the deep, heaving breath of the sea, there shone the smiling\nface of the beloved. Through the countless eyes of the air, her eyes\nwere upon him. In that beloved earth she flowered, like a rose upon a\nrose-tree.\n",
                "Then he regained possession of himself. He took the train for Rome and\nnever stopped. He had no interest in the old memories of Italy, or the\ncities of the art of past ages. He saw nothing of Rome, nor wanted to:\nand what he did see at first, in passing, the styleless new districts,\nthe square blocks of buildings, gave him no desire to see more.\n",
                "As soon as he arrived he went to see Grazia. She asked him:\n",
                "\"How did you come? Did you stop at Milan or Florence?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" he said. \"Why should I?\"\n",
                "She laughed.\n",
                "\"That's a fine thing to say! And what do you think of Rome?\"\n",
                "\"Nothing,\" he said. \"I haven't seen it!\"\n",
                "\"Not yet?\"\n",
                "\"Nothing. Not a single monument. I came straight to you from my hotel.\"\n",
                "\"You don't need to go far to see Rome.... Look at that wall opposite....\nYou only need to see its light.\"\n",
                "\"I only see you,\" he said.\n",
                "\"You are a barbarian. You only see your own ideas. When did you leave\nSwitzerland?\"\n",
                "\"A week ago.\"\n",
                "\"What have you been doing since then?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know. I stopped, by chance, at a place by the sea. I never\nnoticed its name. I slept for a week. Slept, with my eyes open. I do not\nknow what I have seen, or what I have dreamed. I think I was dreaming of\nyou. I know that it was very beautiful. But the most lovely part of it\nall is that I forgot everything....\"\n",
                "\"Thank you!\" she said.\n",
                "(He did not listen.)\n",
                "\"... Everything,\" he went on. \"Everything that was then, everything that\nhad been before. I am a new man. I am beginning to live again.\"\n",
                "\"It is true,\" she said, looking into his laughing eyes. \"You have\nchanged since we last met.\"\n",
                "He looked at her, too, and found her no less different from his memory\nof her. Not that she had changed in two months, but he was seeing her\nwith new eyes. Yonder, in Switzerland, the image of old days, the faint\nshadow of the girl Grazia, had flitted between his gaze and this new\nactual beloved. Now, in the sun of Italy, the dreams of the North had\nmelted away: in the clear light of day he saw her real soul and body.\nHow far removed she was from the little, wild, imprisoned girl of Paris,\nhow far from the woman with the smile like Saint John, whom he had met\none evening, shortly after her marriage, only to lose her again! Out of\nthe little Umbrian Madonna had flowered a lovely Roman lady:\n",
                "_Color verus, corpus solidum et succi plenum._\n",
                "Her figure had taken on an harmonious fullness: her body was bathed in a\nproud languor. The very genius of tranquillity hovered in her presence.\nShe had that greed of sunny silence, and still contemplation, the\ndelightful joy in the peace of living which the people of the North will\nnever really know. What especially she had preserved out of the past was\nher great kindness which inspired all her other feelings. But in her\nluminous smile many new things were to be read: a melancholy indulgence,\na little weariness, much knowledge of the ways of men, a fine irony, and\ntranquil common sense. The years had veiled her with a certain coldness,\nwhich protected her against the illusions of the heart; rarely could she\nsurrender herself; and her tenderness was ever on the alert, with a\nsmile that seemed to know and tell everything, against the passionate\nimpulses that Christophe found it hard to suppress. She had her\nweaknesses, moments of abandonment to the caprice of the minute, a\ncoquetry at which she herself mocked but never fought against. She was\nnever in revolt against things, nor against herself: she had come to a\ngentle fatalism, and she was altogether kind, but a little weary.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "She entertained a great deal, and--at least, in appearance--not very\nselectively: but as, for the most part, her intimates belonged to the\nsame world, breathed the same atmosphere, had been fashioned by the same\nhabits, they were homogeneous and harmonious enough, and very different\nfrom the polite assemblages that Christophe had known in France and\nGermany. The majority were of old Italian families, vivified here and\nthere by foreign marriages; they all had a superficial cosmopolitanism\nand a comfortable mixture of the four chief languages, and the\nintellectual baggage of the four great nations of the West. Each nation\nbrought into the pool its personal characteristic, the Jews their\nrestlessness and the Anglo-Saxons their phlegm, but everything was\nquickly absorbed in the Italian melting-pot. When centuries of great\nplundering barons have impressed on a race the haughty and rapacious\nprofile of a bird of prey, the metal may change, but the imprint remains\nthe same. Many of the faces that seemed the most pronouncedly Italian,\nwith a Luini smile, or the voluptuous, calm gaze of a Titian, flowers of\nthe Adriatic, or the plains of Lombardy, had blossomed on the shrubs of\nthe North transplanted to the old Latin soil. Whatever colors be spread\non the palette of Rome, the color which stands out is always Roman.\n",
                "Christophe could not analyze his impressions, but he admired the perfume\nof an age-old culture, an ancient civilization exhaled by these people,\nwho were often mediocre, and, in some cases, less than mediocre. It was\na subtle perfume, springing from the smallest trifles. A graceful\ncourtesy, a gentleness of manners that could be charming and\naffectionate, and at the same time malicious and consciously superior,\nan elegant finesse in the use of the eyes, the smile, the alert,\nnonchalant, skeptical, diverse, and easy intelligence. There was nothing\neither stiff or familiar. Nothing literary. Here there was no fear of\nmeeting the psychologues of a Parisian drawing-room, ensconced behind\ntheir eyeglasses, or the corporalism of a German pedant. They were men,\nquite simply, and very human men, such as were the friends of Terence\nand Scipio the \u00c6milian....\n",
                "_Homo sum_....\n",
                "It was fine to see. It was a life more of appearance than reality.\nBeneath it lay an incurable frivolity which is common to the polite\nsociety of every country. But what made this society characteristic of\nits race was its indolence. The frivolity of the French is accompanied\nby a fever of the nerves--a perpetual agitation of the mind, even when\nit is empty. The brain of the Italian knows how to rest. It knows it\nonly too well. It is sweet to sleep in the warm shadows, on the soft\npillow of a padded Epicureanism, and a very supple, fairly curious, and,\nat bottom, prodigiously indifferent intelligence.\n",
                "All the men of this society were entirely lacking in decided opinions.\nThey dabbled in politics and art in the same dilettante fashion. Among\nthem were charming natures, handsome, fine-featured patrician, Italian\nfaces, with soft, intelligent eyes, men with gentle, quiet manners, who,\nwith exquisite taste and affectionate hearts, loved Nature, the old\nmasters, flowers, women, books, good food, their country, music.... They\nloved everything. They preferred nothing. Sometimes one felt that they\nloved nothing. Love played so large a part in their lives, but only on\ncondition that it never disturbed them. Their love was indolent and\nlazy, like themselves; even in their passion it was apt to take on a\ndomestic character. Their solid, harmonious intelligence was fitted with\nan inertia in which all the opposites of thought met without collision,\nwere tranquilly yoked together, smiling, cushioned, and rendered\nharmless. They were afraid of any thorough belief, of taking sides, and\nwere at their ease in semi-solutions and half-thoughts. They were\nconservative-liberal in temper of mind. They needed politics and art\nhalf-way up the hill, like those health resorts where there is no danger\nof asthma or palpitations. They recognized themselves in the lazy plays\nof Goldoni, or the equally diffused light of Manzoni. Their amiable\nindifference was never disturbed. Never could they have said like their\ngreat ancestors: _\"Primum vivere ...\"_ but rather _\"Dapprima,\nquieto vivere.\"_\n",
                "To live in peace. That was the secret vow, the aim of even the most\nenergetic of those who controlled politics. A little Machiavelli, master\nof himself and others, with a heart as cold as his head, a lucid, bored\nintelligence, knowing how and daring to use all means to gain his ends,\nready to sacrifice all his friends to his ambition, would be capable of\nsacrificing his ambition to one thing only: his _quieto vivere_.\nThey needed long periods of absolute lassitude. When they issued from\nthem, as from a good sleep, they were fresh and ready: these grave men,\nthese tranquil Madonnas would be taken with a sudden desire to talk, to\nbe gay, to plunge into social life; then they would break out into a\nprofusion of gestures and words, paradoxical sallies, burlesque humor:\nthey were always playing an _opera bouffe_. In that gallery of\nItalian portraits rarely would you find the marks of thought, the\nmetallic brilliance of the eyes, faces stained with the perpetual labor\nof the mind, such as are to be found in the North. And yet, here, as\nelsewhere, there was no lack of souls turned in upon themselves, to feed\nupon themselves, concealing their woes, and desires and cares seething\nbeneath the mask of indifference, and, voluptuously, drawing on a cloak\nof torpor. And, in certain faces there would peep out, queerly,\ndisconcertingly, indications of some obscure malady of the spirit\npeculiar to very ancient races--like the excavations in the Roman\nCampagna.\n",
                "There was great charm in the enigmatic indifference of these people, and\ntheir calm, mocking eyes, wherein there slumbered hidden tragedy. But\nChristophe was in no humor to recognize it. He was furious at seeing\nGrazia surrounded by worldly people with their courteous, witty, and\nempty manners. He hated them for it, and he was angry with her. He\nsulked at her just as he sulked at Rome. His visits to her became less\nand less frequent, and he began to make up his mind to go.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He did not go. Unknown to himself, he was beginning to feel the\nattraction of Italian society, though it irritated him so much.\n",
                "For the time being, he isolated himself and lounged about Rome and the\nenvironment. The Roman light, the hanging gardens, the Campagna,\nencircled, as by a golden scarf, by the sunlit sea, little by little\ndelivered up to him the secret of the enchanted land. He had sworn not\nto move a step to see the monuments of the dead, which he affected to\ndespise: he used grumblingly to declare that he would wait until they\ncame to look for him. They came; he happened on them by chance on his\nrambling through the City of many hills. Without having looked for it,\nhe saw the Forum red under the setting sun, and the half-ruined arches\nof the Palatine and behind them the deep azure vault of heaven, a gulf\nof blue light. He wandered in the vast Campagna, near the ruddy Tiber,\nthick with mud, like moving earth,--and along the ruined aqueducts, like\nthe gigantic vertebrae of antediluvian monsters. Thick masses of black\nclouds rolled across the blue sky. Peasants on horseback goaded across\nthe desert great herds of pearly-gray cattle with long horns; and along\nthe ancient road, straight, dusty, and bare, goat-footed shepherds, clad\nin thick skins, walked in silence. On the far horizon, the Sabine Chain,\nwith its Olympian lines, unfolded its hills; and on the other edge of\nthe cup of the sky the old walls of the city, the front of Saint John's\nChurch, surmounted with statues which danced in black silhouette....\nSilence.... A fiery sun.... The wind passed over the plain.... On a\nheadless, armless statue, almost inundated by the waving grass, a\nlizard, with its heart beating tranquilly, lay motionless, absorbed,\ndrinking in its fill of light. And Christophe, with his head buzzing\nwith the sunshine (sometimes also with the _Castelli_ wine), sitting on\nthe black earth near the broken statue, smiling, sleepy, lost\nin forgetfulness, breathed in the calm, tremendous force of Rome.--Until\nnightfall.--Then, with his heart full of a sudden anguish, he fled from\nthe gloomy solitude in which the tragic light was sinking.... O earth,\nburning earth, earth passionate and dumb! Beneath thy fevered peace I\nstill can hear the trumpeting of the legions. What a fury of life is\nshining in thy bosom! What a mighty desire for an awakening!\n",
                "Christophe found men in whose souls there burned brands of the age-old\nfire. Beneath the ruse of the dead they had been preserved. It might\nbe thought that the fire had died down with the closing of Mazzini's\neyes. It was springing to life again. It was the same. Very few\nwished to see it. It troubled the quiet of those who were asleep. It\ngave a clear and brutal light. Those who bore it aloft,--young men (the\neldest was not thirty-five), a little band of the elect come from every\npoint of the horizon, men of free intellect who were all different in\ntemperament, education, opinions, and faith--were all united in worship\nof this flame of the new life. The etiquette of parties, systems of\nthought, mattered not to them: the great thing was to \"think with\ncourage.\" To be frank, to be brave, in mind and deed. Rudely they\ndisturbed the sleep of their race. After the political resurrection of\nItaly, awakened from death by the summons of her heroes, after her\nrecent economic resurrection, they had set themselves to pluck Italian\nthought from the grave. They suffered, as from an insult, from the\nindolent and timid indifference of the elect, their cowardice of mind\nand verbolatry. Their _Voices_ rang hollow in the midst of\nrhetoric and the moral slavery which for centuries had been gathering\ninto a crust upon the soul of their country. They breathed into it their\nmerciless realism and their uncompromising loyalty. Though upon occasion\nthey were capable of sacrificing their own personal intellectual\npreferences to the duty of discipline which national life imposes on the\nindividual, yet they reserved their highest altar and their purest ardor\nfor the truth. They loved truth with fiery, pious hearts. Insulted by\nhis adversaries, defamed, threatened, one of the leaders of these young\nmen replied, with grand, calm dignity:\n",
                "_\"Respect the truth. I speak to you now, from my heart, with no shade\nof bitterness. I forget the ill I have received at your hands and the\nevil that I may have done you. Be true. There is no conscience, there is\nno noble life, there is no capacity for sacrifice where there is not a\nreligious, a rigid, and a rigorous respect for truth. Strive, then, to\nfulfil this difficult duty. Untruth corrupts whoever makes use of it\nbefore it overcomes him against whom it is used. What does it matter\nthat you gain an immediate success? The roots of your soul will remain\nwithered in the air above the soil that is crumbled away with untruth.\nWe are on a plane superior to our disagreements, even though on your\nlips your passion brings the name of our country. There is one thing\ngreater than a man's country, and that is the human conscience. There\nare laws which you must not violate on pain of being bad Italians. You\nsee before you now only a man who is a seeker after truth: you must hear\nhis cry. You have before you now only a man who ardently desires to see\nyou great and pure, and to work with you. For, whether you will or no,\nwe all work in common with all those who in this world work truthfully.\nThat which comes out of our labors (and we cannot foresee what it will\nbe) will bear our common mark, the mark of us all, if we have labored\nwith truth. The essence of man lies in this, in his marvelous faculty\nfor seeking truth, seeing it, loving it, and sacrificing himself to\nit.--Truth, that over all who possess it spends the magic breath of its\npuissant health!...\"_ [Footnote: The hymn to Truth here introduced is\nan abridgment of an article by Giuseppe Prezzolini (_La Voce_,\nApril 13, 1911).]\n",
                "The first time Christophe heard these words they seemed to him like an\necho of his own voice: and he felt that these men and he were brothers.\nThe chances of the conflict of the nations and ideas might one day fling\nthem into the position of adversaries in the m\u00eal\u00e9e; but, friends or\nenemies, they were, and would always be, members of the same human\nfamily. They knew it, even as he. They knew it, before he did. They knew\nhim before he knew them, for they had been friends of Olivier's.\nChristophe discovered that his friend's writings--(a few volumes of\nverse and critical essays)--which had only been read by a very few in\nParis, had been translated by these Italians, and were as familiar to\nthem as to himself.\n",
                "Later on he was to discover the impassable distance which divided these\nmen from Olivier. In their way of judging others they were entirely\nItalian, incapable of the effort necessary to see beyond themselves,\nrooted in the ideas of their race. At bottom, in all good faith, in\nforeign literature they only sought what their national instinct was\nwilling to find in it; often they only took out of it what they\nthemselves had unconsciously read into it. Mediocre as critics, and as\npsychologists contemptible, they were too single-minded, too full of\nthemselves and their passions, even when they were the most enamored of\ntruth. Italian idealism cannot forget itself: it is not interested in\nthe impersonal dreams of the North; it leads everything back to itself,\nits desires, its pride of race, and transfigures them. Consciously or\nunconsciously, it is always toiling for the _terza Roma_. It must\nbe said that for many centuries it has not taken much trouble to realize\nit. These splendid Italians, who are cut out for action, only act\nthrough passion, and soon weary of it: but when the breath of passion\nrushes in their veins it raises them higher than all other nations; as\nhas been seen, for example, in their _Risorgimento_.--Some such\ngreat wind as that had begun to pass over the young men of Italy of all\nparties: nationalists, socialists, neo-Catholics, free idealists, all the\nunyielding Italians, all, in hope and will, citizens of Imperial Rome,\nQueen of the universe.\n",
                "At first Christophe saw only their generous ardor and the common\nantipathies which united him and them. They could not but join with him\nin their contempt for the fashionable society, against which Christophe\nraged on account of Grazia's preferences. More than he they hated the\nspirit of prudence, the apathy, the compromise, and buffoonery, the\nthings half said, the amphibious thoughts, the subtle dawdling of the\nmind between all possibilities, without deciding on any one, the fine\nphrases, the sweetness of it all. They were all self-taught men who had\npieced themselves together with everything they could lay their hands\non, but had had neither means nor leisure to put the finishing touch to\ntheir work, and they were prone to exaggerate their natural coarseness\nand their rather bitter tone fitting to rough _contadini._ They\nwished to provoke active hostility. Anything rather than indifference.\nIn order to rouse the energy of their race they would gladly have\nconsented to be among the first victims to it.\n",
                "Meanwhile they were not liked, and they did nothing to gain liking.\nChristophe met with but small success when he tried to talk to Grazia of\nhis new friends. They were repugnant to her order-loving, peace-loving\nnature. He had to recognize when he was with her that they had a way of\nupholding the best of causes which sometimes provoked a desire in the\nbest of people to declare themselves hostile to it. They were ironical\nand aggressive, in criticism harsh to the point of insult, even with\npeople whom they had no desire to hurt. Having reached the sphere of\npublication before they had come to maturity, they passed with equal\nintolerance from one infatuation to another. Passionately sincere,\ngiving themselves unreservedly, without stint or thought of economy,\nthey were consumed by their excessive intellectuality, their precocious\nand blindly obstinate endeavors. It is not well for young ideas, hardly\nout of the pod, to be exposed to the raw sunlight. The soul is scorched\nby it. Nothing is made fruitful save with time and silence. Time and\nsilence these men had not allowed themselves. It is the misfortune of\nonly too many Italian talents. Violent, hasty action is an intoxicant.\nThe mind that has once tasted it is hard put to it to break the habit;\nand its normal growth is then in great peril of being forced and forever\ntwisted.\n",
                "Christophe appreciated the acid freshness of such green frankness in\ncontrast with the insipidity of the people who frequented the middle\nway, the _via di mezzo,_ who are in perpetual fear of being\ncompromised, and have a subtle talent for saying neither \"Yes\" nor \"No.\"\nBut very soon he came to see that such people also, with their calm,\ncourteous minds, have their worth. The perpetual state of conflict in\nwhich his new friends lived was very tiring. Christophe began by\nthinking it his duty to go to Grazia's house to defend them. Sometimes\nhe went there to forget them. No doubt he was like them, too much like\nthem. They were now what he had been twenty years ago. And life never\ngoes back. At heart Christophe well knew that, for his own part, he had\nforever said good-by to such violence, and that he was going towards\npeace, whose secret seemed to lie for him in Grazia's eyes. Why, then,\nwas he in revolt against her?... Ah! In the egoism of his love he longed\nto be the only one to enjoy her peace. He could not bear Grazia to\ndispense its benefits without marking how to all comers she extended the\nsame prodigally gracious welcome.\n",

I don't go out of my way\nfor society; but I admit that I like it, just as I like going sometimes\nto an indifferent play, or reading foolish books, which you despise,\nthough I find them soothing and amusing. I cannot refuse anything.\"\n",
                "\"How can you endure these idiots?\"\n",
                "\"Life has taught me not to be too nice. One must not ask too much. It is\na good deal, I assure you, when one finds honest people, with no harm in\nthem, kindly people....

And yet they are fond of me, and\nwhen I find a little real affection, I hold the rest cheap. You are\nangry with me? Forgive me for being an ordinary person.

                "\"What is it?\"\n",

                "\"No, my dear,\" she said tenderly.\n",
                "He could not speak. She saw that he was hurt.\n",
                "\"Forgive me. I have hurt you. I knew that you would say that to me. We\nmust speak out frankly and in all truth, like good friends.\"\n",
                "\"Friends,\" he said sadly. \"Nothing more?\"\n",
                "\"You are ungrateful. What more do you want? To marry me?... Do you\nremember the old days when you had eyes only for my pretty cousin?

Happy marriages are very rare. It is a\nlittle against nature. You cannot bind together the wills of two people\nwithout mutilating one of them, if not both, and it does not even bring\nthe suffering through which it is well and profitable for the soul\nto pass.\"\n",
                "\"Ah!\" he said. \"But I can see in it a fine thing--the union of two\nsacrifices, two souls merged into one.\"\n",
                "\"A fine thing, in your dreams. In reality you would suffer more than any\none.\"\n",
                "\"What! You think I could never have a wife, a family, children?... Don't\nsay that! I should love them so! You think it impossible for me to have\nthat happiness?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know. I don't think so. Perhaps with a good woman, not very\nintelligent, not very beautiful, who would be devoted to you, and would\nnot understand you.\"\n",
                "\"How unkind of you!... But you are wrong to make fun of it. A good woman\nis a fine thing, even if she has no mind.\"\n",

                "\"On the contrary, it is because I love you that I should be happy to do\nanything which could make you happy.\"\n",

                "\"No, no. Don't go back to that. I tell you, it would make you\nmiserable.\"\n",
                "\"Don't worry about me. I swear to you that I shall be happy! Speak the\ntruth: do you think that you would be unhappy with me?\"\n",
                "\"Oh! Unhappy? No, my dear. I respect and admire you too much ever to be\nunhappy with you.... But, I will tell you: I don't think anything could\nmake me very unhappy now. I have seen too much. I have become\nphilosophical.... But, frankly--(You want me to? You won't be\nangry?)--well. I know my own weakness. I should, perhaps, be foolish\nenough, after a few months, not to be perfectly happy with you; and I\nwill not have that, just because my affection for you is the most holy\nthing in the world, and I will not have it tarnished.\"\n",
                "Sadly, he said:\n",
                "\"Yes, you say that, to sweeten the pill. You don't like me. There are\nthings in me which are odious to you.\"\n",

                "\"Then I don't understand. Why couldn't we agree?\"\n",
                "\"Because we are too different--both too decided, too individual.\"\n",
                "\"That is why I love you.\"\n",
                "\"I too. But that is why we should find ourselves conflicting.\"\n",
                "\"No.\" \"Yes. Or, rather, as I know that you are bigger than I, I should\nreproach myself with embarrassing you with my smaller personality, and\nthen I should be stifled. I should say nothing, and I should suffer.\"\n",
                "Tears came to Christophe's eyes.\n",
                "\"Oh! I won't have that. Never! I would rather be utterly miserable than\nhave you suffering through my fault, for my sake.\"\n",
                "\"My dear, you mustn't feel it like that.... You know, I say all that,\nbut I may be flattering myself.... Perhaps I should not be so good as to\nsacrifice myself for you.\"\n",
                "\"All the better.\"\n",
                "\"But, then, I should sacrifice you, and that would be misery for me....\nYou see, there is no solving the difficulty either way. Let us stay as\nwe are. Could there be anything better than our friendship?\"\n",
                "He nodded his head and smiled a little bitterly.\n",
                "\"Yes. That is all very well. But at bottom you don't love me enough.\"\n",
                "She smiled too, gently, with a little melancholy, and said, with a sigh:\n",
                "\"Perhaps. You are right. I am no longer young. I am tired. Life wears\none out unless one is very strong, like you.... Oh! you, there are times\nwhen I look at you and you seem to be a boy of eighteen.\"\n",
                "\"Alas! With my old face, my wrinkles, my dull skin!\"\n",
                "\"I know that you have suffered as much as I--perhaps more. I can see\nthat. But sometimes you look at me with the eyes of a boy, and I feel\nyou giving out a fresh stream of life. I am worn out. When I think of my\nold eagerness, then--alas! As one said, 'Those were great days. I was\nvery unhappy!' I hold to life only by a thread. I should never be bold\nenough to try marriage again. Ah! Then! Then!... If you had only given a\nsign!...\"\n",
                "\"Well, then, well, tell me....\"\n",

                "\"Yes. If you had...? I said nothing.\"\n",
                "\"I understood. You are cruel.\"\n",
                "\"Take it, then, that in the old days I was a fool.\"\n",
                "\"You are making it worse and worse.\"\n",
                "\"Poor Christophe! I can't say a word but it hurts you. I shan't say any\nmore.\"\n",
                "\"You must.... Tell me.... Tell me something.\"\n",
                "\"Something?\"\n",
                "\"Something kind.\"\n",

                "\"Then you must not be sad.\"\n",
                "\"How can I be anything else?\"\n",

                "\"Why?\"\n",

                "\"Truly?\"\n",
                "\"If I tell you so, won't you believe me?\"\n",
                "\"Tell me, then.\"\n",
                "\"You won't be sad any longer? You won't be insatiable? You will be\ncontent with our dear friendship?\"\n",
                "\"I must.\"\n",
                "\"Oh! Ungrateful! And you say you love me? Really, I think I love you\nbetter than you love me.\"\n",
                "\"Ah! If it were possible.\"\n",
                "He said that with such an outburst of lover's egoism that she laughed.\nHe too. He insisted:\n",
                "\"Tell me!...\"\n",
                "For a moment she was silent, looking at him, then suddenly she brought\nher face close to Christophe's and kissed him. It was so unexpected! His\nheart leaped within him. He tried to take her in his arms. But she had\nescaped. At the door of the little room she laid her finger on her\nlips.--\"Hush!\"--and disappeared.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "From that moment on he did not again speak to her of his love, and he\nwas less awkward in his relation with her. Their alternations of\nstrained silence and ill-suppressed violence were succeeded by a simple\nrestful intimacy. That is the advantage of frankness in friendship. No\nmore hidden meanings, no more illusions, no more fears. Each knew the\nother's innermost thoughts. Now when Christophe was with Grazia in the\ncompany of strangers who irritated him and he lost patience at hearing\nher exchange with them the empty remarks usual in polite society, she\nwould notice it and look at him and smile. It was enough to let him know\nthat they were together, and he would find his peace restored.\n",
                "The presence of the beloved robs the imagination of its poisoned dart:\nthe fever of desire is cooled: the soul becomes absorbed in the chaste\npossession of the loved presence.--Besides, Grazia shed on all about her\nthe silent charm of her harmonious nature. Any exaggeration of voice or\ngesture, even if it were involuntary, wounded her, as a thing that was\nnot simple and beautiful. In this way she influenced Christophe little\nby little. Though at first he tugged at the bridle put upon his\neagerness, he slowly gained the mastery of himself, and he was all the\nstronger since his force was not wasted in useless violence.\n",
                "Their souls met and mingled. Grazia, who had smilingly surrendered to\nthe sweetness of living, was awaked from her slumber by contact with\nChristophe's moral energy. She took a more direct and less passive\ninterest in the things of the mind. She used to read very little,\npreferring to browse indolently over the same old books, but now she\nbegan to be curious about new ideas, and soon came to feel their\nattraction. The wealth of the world of modern ideas, which was not\nunknown to her though she had never cared to adventure in it alone, no\nlonger frightened her now that she had a companion and guide. Insensibly\nshe suffered herself, while she protested against it, to be drawn on to\nan understanding of the young Italians, whose ardent iconoclasm had\nalways been distasteful to her.\n",
                "But Christophe profited the more by this mutual perception. It has often\nbeen observed in love that the weaker of the two gives the most: it is\nnot that the other loves less, but, being stronger, must take more. So\nChristophe had already been enriched by Olivier's mind. But this new\nmystic marriage was far more fruitful; for Grazia brought him for her\ndowry the rarest treasure, that Olivier had never possessed--joy. The\njoy of the soul and of the eyes. Light. The smile of the Latin sky, that\nloves the ugliness of the humblest things, and sets the stones of the\nold walls flowering, and endows even sadness with its calm radiance.\n",
                "The budding spring entered into alliance with her. The dream of new life\nwas teeming in the warmth of the slumbering air. The young green was\nwedding with the silver-gray of the olive-trees. Beneath the dark red\narches of the ruined aqueducts flowered the white almond-trees. In the\nawakening Campagna waved the seas of grass and the triumphant flames of\nthe poppies. Down the lawns of the villas flowed streams of purple\nanemones and sheets of violets. The glycine clambered up the\numbrella-shaped pines, and the wind blowing over the city brought the\nscent of the roses of the Palatine.\n",
                "They went for walks together. When she was able to shake off the almost\nOriental torpor, in which for hours together she would muse, she became\nanother creature: she loved walking; she was tall, with a fine length of\nleg, and a strong, supple figure, and she looked like a Diana of\nPrimatice.--Most often they would go to one of the villas, left like\nflotsam from the shipwreck of the Splendid Rome of the _setticento_\nunder the assault of the flood of the Piedmontese barbarians. They\npreferred, above all, the Villa Mattei, that promontory of ancient Rome,\nbeneath which the last waves of the deserted Campagna sink and die. They\nused to go down the avenue of oaks that, with its deep vault, frames the\nblue, the pleasant chains of the Alban hills, softly swelling like a\nbeating heart. Along the path through the leaves they could see the\ntombs of Roman husbands and wives, lying sadly there, with hands clasped\nin fidelity. They used to sit down at the end of the avenue, under an\narbor of roses against a white sarcophagus. Behind them the desert.\nProfound peace. The murmuring of a slow-dropping fountain, trickling\nlanguidly, so languidly that it seemed on the point of dying. They would\ntalk in whispers. Grazia's eyes would trustfully gaze into the eyes of\nher friend. Christophe would tell her of his life, his struggles, his\npast sorrows; and there was no more sadness in them. In her presence,\nwith her eyes upon him, everything was simple, everything seemed\ninevitable.... She, in her turn, would tell of her life. He hardly heard\nwhat she said, but none of her thoughts were lost upon him. His soul and\nhers were wedded. He saw with her eyes. Everywhere he saw her eyes, her\ntranquil eyes, in the depths of which there burned an ardent fire; he\nsaw them in the fair, mutilated faces of the antique statues and in the\nriddle of their silent gaze: he saw them in the sky of Rome, lovely\nlaughing around the matted crests of the cypress-trees and through the\nfingers of the _lecci,_ black, shining, riddled with the sun's arrows.\n",
                "Through Grazia's eyes the meaning of Latin art reached his heart. Till\nthen Christophe had been entirely indifferent to the work of the\nItalians. The barbarian idealist, the great bear from the German\nforests, had not yet learned to taste the delicious savor of the lovely\ngilded marbles, golden as honey. The antiques of the Vatican were\nfrankly repulsive to him. He was disgusted by their stupid faces, their\neffeminate or massive proportions, their banal, rounded modeling, all\nthe Gitons and gladiators. Hardly more than a few portrait-statues found\nfavor in his sight, and the originals had absolutely no interest for\nhim. He was no more kindly towards the pale, grimacing Florentines and\ntheir sick Madonnas and pre-Raphaelite Venuses, anaemic, consumptive,\naffected, and tormented. And the bestial stupidity of the red, sweating\nbullies and athletes let loose upon the world by the example of the\nSistine Chapel made him think of cast-iron. Only for Michael Angelo did\nhe have a secret feeling of pious sympathy with his tragic sufferings,\nhis divine contempt, and the loftiness of his chaste passions. With a\npure barbaric love, like that of the master, he loved the religious\nnudity of his youths, his shy, wild virgins, like wild creatures caught\nin a trap, the sorrowful Aurora, the wild-eyed Madonna, with her Child\nbiting at her breast, and the lovely Lia, whom he would fain have had to\nwife. But in the soul of the tormented hero he found nothing more than\nthe echo of his own.\n",
                "Grazia opened the gates of a new world of art for him. He entered into\nthe sovereign serenity of Raphael and Titian. He saw the imperial\nsplendor of the classic genius, which, like a lion, reigns over the\nuniverse of form conquered and mastered. The flashing vision of the\ngreat Venetian which goes straight to the heart of life, and with its\nlightning cleaves the hovering mists that veil it, the masterful might\nof these Latin minds that cannot only conquer, but also conquer\nthemselves, and in victory impose upon themselves the straitest\ndiscipline, and, on the field of battle, have the art exactly to choose\ntheir rightful booty from among the spoils of the enemy overthrown--the\nOlympian portraits and the _stanze_ of Raphael filled Christophe's\nheart with music richer than Wagner's, the music of serene lives, noble\narchitecture, harmonious grouping, the music which shines forth from the\nperfect beauty of face, hands, feet, draperies, and gestures.\nIntelligence. Love. The stream of love which springs from those youthful\nsouls and bodies. The might of the spirit and delight. Young tenderness,\nironic wisdom, the warm obsessing odor of amorous bodies, the luminous\nsmile in which the shadows are blotted out and passion slumbers. The\nquivering force of life rearing and reined in, like the horses of the\nSun, by the sturdy hand of the master....\n",
                "And Christophe wondered:\n",
                "\"Is it impossible to unite, as they have done, the force and the peace\nof the Romans? Nowadays the best men aspire only to force or peace, one\nto the detriment of the other. Of all men the Italians seem most utterly\nto have lost the sense of harmony which Poussin, Lorraine, and Goethe\nunderstood. Must a stranger once more reveal to them its work?... And\nwhat man shall teach it to our musicians? Music has not yet had its\nRaphael. Mozart is only a child, a little German bourgeois, with\nfeverish hands and sentimental soul, who uses too many words, too many\ngestures, and chatters and weeps and laughs over nothing. And neither\nthe Gothic Bach nor the Prometheus of Bonn, struggling with the vulture,\nnor his offspring of Titans piling Pelion on Ossa, and hurling\nimprecations at the Heavens, have ever seen the smile of God....\"\n",
                "After he had seen it, Christophe was ashamed of his own music; his vain\nagitation, his turgid passions, his indiscreet exclamations, his parade\nof himself, his lack of moderation, seemed to him both pitiable and\nshameful. A flock of sheep without a shepherd, a kingdom without a\nking.--A man must be the king of his tumultuous soul....\n",
                "During these months Christophe seemed to have forgotten music. He hardly\nwrote at all, feeling no need for it. His mind, fertilized by Rome, was\nin a period of gestation. He spent days together in a dreamy state of\nsemi-intoxication. Nature, like himself, was in the early spring-time,\nwhen the languor of the awakening is mixed with a voluptuous dizziness.\nNature and he lay dreaming, locked in each other's arms, like lovers\nembracing in their sleep. The feverish enigma of the Campagna was no\nlonger hostile and disturbing to him; he had made himself master of its\ntragic beauty; in his arms he held Demeter, sleeping.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "During April he received an invitation from Paris to go there and\nconduct a series of concerts. Without troubling to think it over, he\ndecided to refuse, but thought it better to mention it to Grazia. It was\nvery sweet to him to consult her about his life, for it gave him the\nillusion that she shared it.\n",
                "This time she gave him a shock of disillusion. She made him explain the\nwhole matter to her, and advised him to accept. He was very hurt, and\nsaw in her advice the proof of her indifference.\n",
                "Probably Grazia was sorry to give him such advice. But why did\nChristophe ask her for it? The more he turned to her and asked her to\ndecide for him, the more she thought herself responsible for her\nfriend's actions. As a result of their interchange of ideas she had\ngained from Christophe a little of his will-power: he had revealed to\nher duty and the beauty of action. At least she had recognized duty as\nfar as her friend was concerned, and she would not have him fail in it.\nBetter than he, she knew the power of languor given off by the Italian\nsoil, which, like the insidious poison of its warm _scirocco_,\ncreeps into the veins and sends the will to sleep. How often had she not\nfelt its maleficent charm, and had no power to resist it! All her\nfriends were more or less tainted by this malaria of the soul. Stronger\nmen than they had in old days fallen victim to it: it had rusted away\nthe brass of the Roman she-wolf. Rome breathes forth death: it is too\nfull of graves. It is healthier to stay there for a little time than to\nlive there. Too easily does one slip out of one's own time, a dangerous\ntaste for the still young forces that have a vast duty to accomplish.\nGrazia saw clearly that the society about her had not a life-giving air\nfor an artist. And although she had more friendship for Christophe than\nfor any other ... (dared she confess it?) ... she was not, at heart,\nsorry for him to go. Alas! He wearied her with the very qualities that\nshe most loved in him, his overflowing intelligence, his abundance of\nvitality, accumulated for years, and now brimming over: her tranquillity\nwas disturbed by it. And he wearied her, too, perhaps, because she was\nalways conscious of the menace of his love, beautiful and touching, but\never-present: so that she had always to be on her guard against it; it\nwas more prudent to keep him at a distance. She did not admit it to\nherself, and thought she had no consideration for anything but\nChristophe's interests.\n",
                "There was no lack of sound reasons at hand. In Italy just then it was\ndifficult for a musician to live: the air was circumscribed. The musical\nlife of the country was suppressed and deformed. The factory of the\ntheater scattered its heavy ashes and its burning smoke upon the soil,\nwhose flowers in old days had perfumed all Europe. If a man refused to\nenroll himself in the train of the brawlers, and could not, or would\nnot, enter the factory, he was condemned to exile or a stifled\nexistence. Genius was by no means dried up. But it was left to stagnate\nunprofitably and to go to ruin. Christophe had met more than one young\nmusician in whom there lived again the soul of the melodious masters of\nthe race and the instinct of beauty which filled the wise and simple art\nof the past. But who gave a thought to them? They could neither get\ntheir work played nor published. No interest was taken in the symphony.\nThere were no ears for music except it were presented with a painted\nface!... So discouraged, they sang for themselves, and soon sang no\nmore. What was the good of it? Sleep....--Christophe would have asked\nnothing better than to help them. While they admitted that he could do\nso, their umbrageous pride would not consent to it. Whatever he did, he\nwas a foreigner to them; and for Italians of long descent, in spite of\nthe warm welcome they will give him, every foreigner is really a\nbarbarian. They thought that the wretched condition of their art was a\nquestion to be threshed out among themselves, and while, they extended\nall kind of friendly tributes to Christophe, they could not admit him as\none of themselves.--What could he do? He could not compete with them and\ndispute with them their meager place in the sun, where they were by no\nmeans secure!...\n",
                "Besides, genius cannot do without its food. The musician must have\nmusic--music to hear, music to make heard. A temporary withdrawal is\nvaluable to the mind by forcing it to recuperate. But this can only be\non condition that it will return. Solitude is noble, but fatal to an\nartist who has not the strength to break out of it. An artist must live\nthe life of his own time, even if it be clamorous and impure: he must\nforever be giving and receiving, and giving, and giving, and again\nreceiving.--Italy, at the time of Christophe's sojourn, was no longer\nthe great market of the arts that once it was, and perhaps will be\nagain. Nowadays the meeting-place of ideas, the exchange of the thought\nand spirit of the nations, are in the North. He who has the will to live\nmust live in the North.\n",
                "Left to himself, Christophe would have shuddered away from the rout. But\nGrazia felt his duty more clearly than he could see it. And she demanded\nmore of him than of herself: no doubt because she valued him more\nhighly, but also because it suited her. She delegated her energy upon\nhim, and so maintained her tranquillity.--He had not the heart to be\nangry with her for it. Like Mary, hers was the better part. Each of us\nhas his part to play in life. Christophe's was action. For her it was\nenough to be. He asked no more of her.\n",
                "He asked nothing but to love her, if it were possible, a little less for\nhimself, and a little more for her. For he did not altogether like her\nhaving so little egoism in her friendship as to think only of the\ninterests of her friend--who asked only to be allowed to give no thought\nto them.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He went away from her. And yet he did not leave her. As an old trouv\u00e8re\nsays: \"_The lover does not leave his beloved but with the sanction of\nhis soul._\"\n"

                "He was sick at heart as he reached Paris. It was the first time he had\nbeen there since the death of Olivier. He had wished never to see the\ncity again. In the cab which took him from the station to his hotel he\nhardly dared look out of the window; for the first few days he stayed in\nhis room and could not bring himself to go out. He was fearful of the\nmemories lying in wait for him outside. But what exactly did he dread?\nDid he really know? Was it, as he tried to believe, the terror of seeing\nthe dead spring to life again exactly as they had been? Or was it--the\ngreater sorrow of being forced to know that they were dead?... Against\nthis renewal of grief all the half-unconscious ruses of instinct had\ntaken up arms. It was for this reason--(though perhaps he knew it\nnot)--that he had chosen a hotel in a district far removed from that in\nwhich he had lived. And when for the first time he went out into the\nstreets, having to conduct rehearsals at the concert-hall, when once\nmore he came in contact with the life of Paris, he walked for a long\ntime with his eyes closed, refusing to see what he did see, insisting on\nseeing only what he had seen in old days. He kept on saying to himself:\n",

The young men of twenty years ago were now more\nconservative than the old conservatives whom they had fought, and their\ncritics refused the newcomers the right to live.

I had nothing. I had lost you. Here I was\nfeeling terribly the absence of those whom I have lost. All my old\nfriends of whom I used to tell you have disappeared--Philomela--(you\nremember the singing voice that dear, sad night when, as I wandered\nthrough a gay crowd, I saw your eyes in a mirror gazing at\nme)--Philomela has realized her very reasonable dream: she inherited a\nlittle money, and has a farm in Normandy. M. Arnaud has retired and gone\nback to the provinces with his wife, to a little town near Angers. Of\nthe famous men of my day many are dead or gone under; none are left save\nthe same old puppets who twenty years ago were playing the juvenile lead\nin art and politics, and with the same false faces are still playing it.\nOutside these masks there are none whom I recognize. They seem to me to\nbe grimacing over a grave. It is a terrible feeling.--More than this:\nduring the first few days after my arrival I suffered physically from\nthe ugliness of things, from the gray light of the North after your\ngolden sun: the masses of dull houses, the vulgar lines of certain domes\nand monuments, which had never struck me before, hurt me cruelly. Nor\nwas the moral atmosphere any more to my taste.\n",
                "\"And yet I have no complaint to make of the Parisians. They have given\nme a welcome altogether different from that which I received before. In\nmy absence I seem to have become a kind of celebrity. I will say nothing\nof that, for I know what it is worth. I am touched by all the pleasant\nthings which these people say and write of me, and am obliged to them.\nBut what shall I say to you? I felt much nearer the people who attacked\nme in old days than I do to the people who laud me now.... It is my own\nfault, I know. Don't scold me. I had a moment of uneasiness. It was to\nbe expected. It is done now. I understand. Yes. You are right to have\nsent me back among men. I was in a fair way to be buried in my solitude.\nIt is unhealthy to play at Zarathustra. The flood of life moves on,\nmoves on away from us. There comes a time when one is as a desert.

What a race of rodents!'--a race of beavers. Just when\nyou think them prostrate on their ruins, lo, they are using the ruins to\nlay the foundations of a new city.

There are also people who\ncan do nothing without vilifying what their neighbors are doing. All\nthis is calculated to upset the stoutest head. But when you have lived,\nas I have, nearly ten years with them, you cannot be deceived by their\nuproar. You see then that it is their way of spurring themselves on to\nwork. They talk, but they work, and as each builder's yard sets about\nbuilding a house, in the end you find that the city has been re-builded.\nWhat is most remarkable is that, taken together, all these buildings are\nnot discordant. They may maintain opposing theses, but all their minds\nare cast in the same mold. So that, beneath their anarchy, there are\ncommon instincts, a racial logic which takes the place of discipline,\nand this discipline is, when all is told, probably more solid than that\nof a Prussian regiment.\n",

He was the grandson of\na peasant, the son of a small official, a clerk in a _mairie_ in a\nvillage in the North. They wanted to make him a gentleman, a lawyer, and\nhe was sent to school in the neighboring town. He was a sturdy country\nboy, not at all fitted for being cooped up over the small work of a\nnotary's office, and he could not stay caged in: he used to jump over\nthe wall, and wander through the fields, and run after the girls, and\nspend his strength in brawling: the rest of the time he lounged and\ndreamed of things he would never do. Only one thing had any attraction\nfor him: music. God knows why! There was not a single musician in his\nfamily, except a rather cracked great-uncle, one of those odd,\nprovincial characters, whose often remarkable intelligence and gifts are\nspent, in their proud isolation, on whims, and cranks, and trivialities.\nThis great-uncle had invented a new system of notation--(yet\nanother!)--which was to revolutionize music; he even claimed to have\nfound a system of stenography by which words, tune, and accompaniment\ncould be written simultaneously; but he never managed to transcribe it\ncorrectly himself. They just laughed at the old man in the family, but\nall the same, they were proud of him. They thought: 'He is an old\nmadman. Who knows? Perhaps he is a genius.'--It was no doubt from him\nthat the grandnephew had his mania for music. What music could he hear\nin the little town?... But bad music can inspire a love as pure as good\nmusic.\n",
                "\"The unhappy part of it was that there seemed no possibility of\nconfessing to such a passion in such surroundings: and the boy had not\nhis great-uncle's cracked brains. He hid away to read the old lunatic's\nlucubrations which formed the basis of his queer musical education. Vain\nand fearful of his father and of public opinion, he would say nothing of\nhis ambitions until he had succeeded. He was crushed by his family, and\ndid as so many French people of the middle-class have to do when, out of\nweakness or kindness, they dare not oppose the will of their relations:\nthey submit to all appearance, and live their true life in perpetual\nsecrecy. Instead of following his bent, he struggled on, against his\ninclination, in the work they had marked out for him. He was as\nincapable of succeeding in it as he was of coming to grief. Somehow or\nother he managed to pass the necessary examinations. The main advantage\nto him was that he escaped from the spying of his father and the\nneighbors. The law crushed him: he was determined not to spend his life\nin it. But while his father was alive he dared not declare his desire.\nPerhaps it was not altogether distasteful to him to have to wait a\nlittle before he took the decisive step. He was one of those men who all\ntheir lives long dazzle themselves with what they will do later on, with\nthe things they could do. For the moment he did nothing. He lost his\nbearings, and, intoxicated by his new life in Paris, gave himself up\nwith all his young peasant brutality to his two passions, woman and\nmusic; he was crazed with the concerts he went to, no less than with\npleasure.

The little girl took after her\nmother: she was made to play the piano, though she had not a shadow of\ntalent; she adored her father, and applied herself to her work to please\nhim. For several years they plied the hotels in the watering-places,\npicking up more insults than money. The child was ailing and overworked,\nand died. The wife grew desperate, and became more shrewish every day.\nSo his life became one of endless misery, with no hope of escape,\nbrightened only by an ideal which he knew himself to be incapable of\nattaining....\n",
                "\"And, my dear, when I saw that poor broken devil, whose life has been\nnothing but a series of disappointments, I thought: 'That is what I\nmight have been.' There was much in common in our boyhood, and certain\nadventures in our two lives are the same; I have even found a certain\nkinship in some of our musical ideas: but his have stopped short. What\nis it that has kept me from foundering as he has done? My will, no\ndoubt. But also the chances of life. And even taking my will, is that\ndue only to my merits? Is it not rather due to my descent, my friends,\nand God who has aided me?... Such thoughts make a man humble. With such\nthoughts he feels brotherly to all who love his art, and suffer for it.\n",
                "\"Prom lowest to highest the distance is not so great....\n",
                "\"On that I thought of what you said in your letter. You are right: an\nartist has no right to hold aloof, so long as he can help others. So I\nshall stay: I shall force myself to spend a few months in every year\nhere, or in Vienna, or Berlin, although it is hard for me to grow\naccustomed to these cities again. But I must not abdicate. If I do not\nsucceed in being of any great service, as I have good reason to think I\nshall not, perhaps my sojourn in these cities will be useful to me,\nmyself. And I shall console myself with the thought that it was your\nwish. Besides ... (I will not lie)... I am beginning to find it pleasant.\nAdieu, tyrant. You have triumphed. I am beginning not only to do what\nyou want me to do, but to love doing it.\n",

                "So he stayed, partly to please her, but also because his artistic\ncuriosity was reawakened, and was drawn on to contemplation of the\nrenewal of art. Everything that he saw and did he presented for Grazia's\nscrutiny in his letters. He knew that he was deceiving himself as to the\ninterest she would take in it all; he suspected her of a certain\nindifference. But he was grateful to her for not letting him see it too\nclearly.\n",
                "She answered him regularly once a fortnight. Affectionate, composed\nletters, like her gestures. When she told him of her life she never\ndiscarded her tender, proud reserve. She knew the violence with which\nher words went resounding through Christophe's heart. She preferred that\nhe should think her cold, rather than to send him flying to heights\nwhither she did not wish to follow him. But she was too womanly not to\nknow the secret of not discouraging her friend's love, and of, at once,\nby gentle words, soothing the dismay and disappointment caused by her\nindifferent words. Christophe soon divined her tactics, and by a\ncounter-trick tried in his turn to control his warmth and to write more\ncomposedly, so that Grazia's replies should not be so studiously\nrestrained.\n",
                "The longer he stayed in Paris the greater grew his interest in the new\nactivity stirring in that gigantic ant-heap. He was the more interested\nin it all as in the young ants he found less sympathy with himself. He\nwas not deceived: his success was a Pyrrhic victory. After an absence of\nten years his return had created a sensation in Parisian society. But by\nan ironic turn of events, such as is by no means rare, he found himself\npatronized by his old enemies the snobs, and people of fashion: the\nartists were either mutely hostile or distrustful of him. He won his way\nby his name, which already belonged to the past, by his considerable\naccomplishment, by his tone of passionate conviction, and the violence\nof his sincerity. But if people were forced to reckon with him, to\nadmire or respect him, they did not understand or love him. He was\noutside the art of the time. A monster, a living anachronism. He had\nalways been that. His ten years of solitude had accentuated the\ncontrast. During his absence in Europe, and especially in Paris, a\ngreat work of reconstruction had been carried through. A new order was\nspringing to life. A generation was arising, desirous rather of action\nthan of understanding, hungry rather for happiness than for truth. It\nwished to live, to grasp life, even at the cost of a lie. Lies of\npride--all manner of pride: pride of race, pride of caste, pride of\nreligion, pride of culture and art--all were food to this generation,\nprovided that they were armor of steel, provided that they could be\nturned to sword and buckler, and that, sheltered by them, they could\nmarch on to victory.\n",
                "So to this generation it was distasteful to hear the great voice of\ntorment reminding it of the existence of sorrow and doubt, those\nwhirlwinds that had troubled the night that was hardly gone, and, in\nspite of its denials, went on menacing the universe, the whirlwinds that\nit wished to forget. These young people turned away in despite, and they\nshouted at the top of their voices to deafen themselves. But the voice\nwas heard above them all. And they were angry.\n",
                "Christophe, on the other hand, regarded them with a friendly eye. He\nhailed the upward movement of the world towards happiness. The\ndeliberate narrowness of its impulse affected him not at all. When a man\nwishes to go straight to his goal, he must look straight in front of\nhim. For his part, sitting at the turning of the world, he was rejoiced\nto see behind him the tragic splendor of the night, and, in front of\nhim, the smile of young hope, the uncertain beauty of the fresh, fevered\ndawn. And he was at the stationary point of the axis of the pendulum\nwhile the clock was beginning to go again. Without following its onward\nmarch, he listened joyfully to the beating of the rhythm of life. He\njoined in the hope of those who denied his past agonies. What would be,\nwould be, as he had dreamed. Ten years before, in night and suffering,\nOlivier--the little Gallic cock--had with his frail song announced the\ndistant day. The singer was no more; but his song was coming to pass. In\nthe garden of Prance the birds were singing. And, above all the singing,\nclearer, louder, happier, Christophe suddenly heard the voice of Olivier\ncome to life again.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "He was absently reading a book of poems at a bookstall. The name of the\nauthor was unknown to him. Certain words struck him and he went on\nreading. As he read on between the uncut pages he seemed to recognize a\nfriendly voice, the features of a friend.... He could not define his\nfeeling, nor could he bring himself to put the book down, and so he\nbought it. When he reached his room he resumed his reading. At once the\nold obsession descended on him. The impetuous rhythm of the poem evoked,\nwith a visionary precision, the universe and age-old souls--the gigantic\ntrees of which we are all the leaves and the fruit--the nations. From\nthe pages there arose the superhuman figure of the Mother--she who was\nbefore us, she who will be after us. She who reigns, like the Byzantine\nMadonnas, lofty as the mountains, at whose feet kneel and pray ant-like\nhuman beings. The poet was hymning the homeric struggle of the great\ngoddesses, whose lances had clashed together since the beginning of the\nages: the eternal Iliad which is to that of Troy what the Alps are to\nthe little hills of Greece.\n",
                "Such an epic of warlike pride and action was far removed from the ideas\nof a European soul like Christophe's. And yet, in gleams, in the vision\nof the French soul--the graceful virgin, who bears the Aegis, Athena,\nwith blue eyes shining through the darkness, the goddess of work, the\nincomparable artist, sovereign reason, whose glittering lance hurls down\nthe tumultuously shouting barbarians--Christophe perceived an\nexpression, a smile that he knew and had loved. But just as he was on\nthe point of fixing it the vision died away. And while he was\nexasperated by this vain pursuit, lo! as he turned a page, he came on a\nstory which Olivier had told him a few days before his death....\n",
                "He was struck dumb. He ran to the publishers, and asked for the poet's\naddress. It was refused, as is the custom. He lost his temper. In vain.\nFinally he remembered that he could find what he wanted in a year-book.\nHe did find it, and went at once to the author's house. When he wanted\nanything he found it impossible to wait.\n",
                "It was in the Batignolles district on the top floor. There were several\ndoors opening on to a common landing. Christophe knocked at the door\nwhich had been pointed out to him. The next door opened. A young woman,\nnot at all pretty, very dark, with low-growing hair and a sallow\ncomplexion--a shriveled face with very sharp eyes--asked what he wanted.\nShe looked suspicious. Christophe told her why he had come, and, in\nanswer to her next question, gave his name. She came out of her room and\nopened the other door with a key which she had in her pocket. But she\ndid not let Christophe enter immediately. She told him to wait in the\ncorridor, and went in alone, shutting the door in his face. At last\nChristophe reached the well-guarded sanctum. He crossed a half-empty\nroom which served as a dining-room and contained only a few shabby\npieces of furniture, while near the curtainless window several birds\nwere twittering in an aviary. In the next room, on a threadbare divan,\nlay a man. He sat up to welcome Christophe. At once Christophe\nrecognized the emaciated face, lit up by the soul, the lovely velvety\nblack eyes burning with a feverish flame, the long, intelligent hands,\nthe misshapen body, the shrill, husky voice.... Emmanuel! The little\ncripple boy who had been the innocent cause.... And Emmanuel, suddenly\nrising to his feet, had also recognized Christophe.\n",
                "They stood for a moment without speaking. Both of them saw Olivier....\nThey could not bring themselves to shake hands. Emmanuel had stepped\nbackward. After ten long years, an unconfessed rancor, the old jealousy\nthat he had had of Christophe, leaped forth from the obscure depths of\ninstinct. He stood still, defiant and hostile.--But when he saw\nChristophe's emotion, when on his lips he read the name that was in\ntheir thoughts: \"Olivier\"--it was stronger than he: he flung himself\ninto the arms held out towards him.\n",
                "Emmanuel asked:\n",
                "\"I knew you were in Paris. But how did you find me?\"\n",
                "Christophe said: \"I read your last book: through it I heard _his_\nvoice.\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" said Emmanuel. \"You recognized it? I owe everything that I am now\nto him.\"\n",
                "(He avoided pronouncing the name.)\n",
                "After a moment he went on gloomily:\n",
                "\"He loved you more than me.\"\n",
                "Christophe smiled:\n",
                "\"If a man loves truly there is neither more nor less: he gives himself\nto all those whom he loves.\"\n",
                "Emmanuel looked at Christophe: the tragic seriousness of his stubborn\neyes was suddenly lit up with a profound sweetness. He took Christophe's\nhand and made him sit on the divan by his side.\n",
                "Each told the story of his life. From fourteen to twenty-five Emmanuel\nhad practised many trades: printer, upholsterer, pedlar, bookseller's\nassistant, lawyer's clerk, secretary to a politician, journalist.... In\nall of them he had found the means of learning feverishly, here and\nthere finding the support of good people who were struck by the little\nman's energy, more often falling into the hands of people who exploited\nhis poverty and his gifts, turning his worst experiences to profit, and\nsucceeding in fighting his way through without too much bitterness,\nleaving behind him only the remains of his feeble health. His singular\naptitude for the dead languages (not so rare as one is inclined to\nbelieve in a race imbued with humanistic traditions) gained him the\ninterest and support of an old Hellenizing priest. These studies, which\nhe had no time to push very far, served him as mental discipline and a\nschool of style. This man, who had risen from the dregs of the people,\nwhose whole education had been won by his own efforts, haphazard, so\nthat there were great gaps in it, had acquired a gift of verbal\nexpression, a mastery of thought over form, such as ten years of a\nuniversity education cannot give to the young bourgeois. He attributed\nit all to Olivier. And yet others had helped him more effectively. But\nfrom Olivier came the spark which in the night of this man's soul had\nlighted the eternal flame. The rest had but poured oil into the lamp.\n",
                "He said:\n",
                "\"I only began to understand him from the moment when he passed away. But\neverything he ever said had become a part of me. His light never left\nme.\"\n",
                "He spoke of his work and the task which he declared had been left to him\nby Olivier; the awakening of the French, the kindling of that torch of\nheroic idealism of which Olivier had been the herald: he wished to make\nhimself the resounding voice which should hover above the battlefield\nand declare the approaching victory: he sang the epic of the new-birth\nof his race.\n",
                "His poems were the product of that strange race that, through the ages,\nhas so strongly preserved its old Celtic aroma, while it has ever taken\na bizarre pride in clothing its ideas with the cast-off clothes and laws\nof the Roman conqueror. There were to be found in it absolutely pure the\nGallic audacity, the spirit of heroic reason, of irony, the mixture of\nbraggadocio and crazy bravura, which set out to pluck the beards of the\nRoman senators, and pillaged the temple of Delphi, and laughingly hurled\nits javelins at the sky. But this little Parisian dwarf had had to shape\nhis passions, as his periwigged grandfathers had done, and as no doubt\nhis great-grandnephews would do, in the bodies of the heroes and gods of\nGreece, two thousand years dead. It is a curious instinct in these\npeople which accords well with their need of the absolute: as they\nimpose their ideas on the remains of the ages, they seem to themselves\nto be imposing them on the ages. The constraint of his classic form only\ngave Emmanuel's passions a more violent impulse. Olivier's calm\nconfidence in the destinies of France had been transformed in his little\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 into a burning faith, hungering for action and sure of triumph.\nHe willed it, he said it, he clamored for it. It was by his exalted\nfaith and his optimism that he had uplifted the souls of the French\npublic. His book had been as effective as a battle. He had made a breach\nin the ranks of skepticism and fear. The whole younger generation had\nthronged to follow him towards the new destiny....\n",
                "He grew excited as he talked: his eyes burned, his pale face glowed pink\nin patches, and his voice rose to a scream. Christophe could not help\nnoticing the contrast between the devouring fire and the wretched body\nthat was its pyre. He was only half-conscious of the irony of this\nstroke of fate. The singer of energy, the poet who hymned the generation\nof intrepid sport, of action, war, could hardly walk without losing his\nbreath, was extremely temperate, lived on a strict diet, drank water,\ncould not smoke, lived without women, bore every passion in his body,\nand was reduced by his health to asceticism.\n",
                "Christophe watched Emmanuel, and he felt a mixture of admiration and\nbrotherly pity. He tried not to show it: but no doubt his eyes betrayed\nhis feeling. Emmanuel's pride, which ever kept an open wound in his\nside, made him think he read commiseration in Christophe's eyes, and\nthat was more odious to him than hatred. The fire in him suddenly died\ndown. He stopped talking. Christophe tried in vain to win back his\nconfidence. His soul had closed up. Christophe saw that he was wounded.\n",
                "The hostile silence dragged on. Christophe got up. Emmanuel took him to\nthe door without a word. His step declared his infirmity: he knew it: it\nwas a point of pride with him to appear indifferent: but he thought\nChristophe was watching him, and his rancor grew.\n",
                "Just as he was coldly shaking hands with his guest, and saying good-by,\nan elegant young lady rang at the door. She was escorted by a\npretentious nincompoop whom Christophe recognized as a man he had seen\nat theatrical first-nights, smiling, chattering, waving his hand,\nkissing the hands of the ladies, and from his stall shedding smiles all\nover the theater: not knowing his name, he had called him \"the\nbuck.\"--The buck and his companion, on seeing Emmanuel, flung themselves\non the _\"cher ma\u00eetre\"_ with obsequious and familiar effusiveness.\nAs Christophe walked away he heard Emmanuel in his dry voice saying that\nhe was too busy to see any one. He admired the man's gift of being\ndisagreeable. He did not know Emmanuel's reasons for scowling at the\nrich snobs who came to gratify him with their indiscreet visits; they\nwere prodigal of fine phrases and eulogy; but they no more thought of\nhelping him in his poverty than the famous friends of C\u00e9sar Franck ever\ndreamed of releasing him from the piano-lessons which he had to give up\nto the last to make a living.\n",
                "Christophe went several times again to see Emmanuel. He never succeeded\nin restoring the intimacy of his first visit. Emmanuel showed no\npleasure in seeing him, and maintained a suspicious reserve. Every now\nand then he would be carried away by the generous need of expansion of\nhis genius: a remark of Christophe's would shake him to the very roots\nof his being: then he would abandon himself to a fit of enthusiastic\nconfidence: and over his secret soul his idealism would cast the glowing\nlight of a flashing poetry. Then, suddenly, he would fall back: he would\nshrivel up into sulky silence: and Christophe would find him hostile\nonce more.\n",
                "They were divided by too many things. Not the least was the difference\nin their ages. Christophe was on the way to full consciousness and\nmastery of himself. Emmanuel was still in process of formation and more\nchaotic than Christophe had ever been. The originality of his face came\nfrom the contradictory elements that were at grips in him; a mighty\nstoicism, struggling to tame a nature consumed by atavistic\ndesires,--(he was the son of a drunkard and a prostitute);--a frantic\nimagination which tugged against the bit of a will of steel; an immense\negoism, and an immense love for others, and of the two it were\nimpossible to tell which would be the conqueror; an heroic idealism and\na morbid thirst for glory which made him impatient of other\nsuperiorities. If Olivier's ideas, and his independence, and his\ndisinterestedness were in him, if Emmanuel was superior to his master by\nhis plebeian vitality which knew not disgust in the face of action, by\nhis poetic genius and his thicker skin, which protected him from disgust\nof all kinds, yet he was very far from reaching the serenity of\nAntoinette's brother: his character was vain and uneasy: and the\nrestlessness of other people only augmented his own.\n",
                "He lived in a stormy alliance with a young woman who was his neighbor,\nthe woman who had received Christophe on his first visit. She loved\nEmmanuel, and was jealously busy over him, looked after his house,\ncopied out his work, and wrote to his dictation. She was not beautiful,\nand she bore the burden of a passionate soul. She came of the people,\nand for a long time worked in a bookbinding workshop, then in the\npost-office. Her childhood had been spent in the stifling atmosphere\ncommon to all the poor workpeople of Paris: souls and bodies all huddled\ntogether, harassing work, perpetual promiscuity, no air, no silence,\nnever any solitude, no opportunity for recuperation or of defending the\ninner sanctuary of the heart. She was proud in spirit, with her mind\never seething with a religious fervor for a confused ideal of truth. Her\neyes were worn out with copying out at night, sometimes without a lamp,\nby moonlight, _Les Mis\u00e9rables_ of Hugo. She had met Emmanuel at a\ntime when he was more unhappy than she, ill and without resources; and\nshe had devoted herself to him. This passion was the first, the only\nliving love of her life. So she attached herself to him with a hungry\ntenacity. Her affection was a terrible trial to Emmanuel, who rather\nsubmitted to than shared it. He was touched by her devotion: he knew\nthat she was his best friend, the only creature to whom he was\neverything, who could not do without him. But this very feeling\noverwhelmed him. He needed liberty and isolation; her eyes always\ngreedily beseeching a look obsessed him: he used to speak harshly to\nher, and longed to say: \"Go!\" He was irritated by her ugliness and her\nclumsy manners. Though he had seen but little of fashionable society,\nand though he heartily despised it,--(for he suffered at appearing even\nuglier and more ridiculous there),--he was sensitive to elegance, and\nalive to the attraction of women who felt towards him (he had no doubt\nof it) exactly as he felt towards his friend. He tried to show her an\naffection which he did not possess or, at least, which was continually\nobscured by gusts of involuntary hatred. He could not do it: he had a\ngreat generous heart in his bosom, hungering to do good, and also a\ndemon of violence, capable of much evil. This inward struggle and his\nconsciousness of his inability to end it to his advantage plunged him\ninto a state of acute irritation, which he vented on Christophe.\n",
                "Emmanuel could not help feeling a double antipathy towards Christophe;\nfirstly because of his old jealousy (one of those childish passions\nwhich still subsist, though we may forget the cause of them): secondly,\nbecause of his fierce nationalism. In France he had embodied all the\ndreams of justice, pity, and human brotherhood conceived by the best men\nof the preceding age. He did not set France against the rest of Europe\nas an enemy whose fortune is swelled by the ruin of the other nations,\nbut placed her at their head, as the legitimate sovereign who reigns for\nthe good of all--the sword of the ideal, the guide of the human race.\nRather than see her commit an injustice he would have preferred to see\nher dead. But he had no doubt of her. He was exclusively French in\nculture and in heart, nourished wholly by the French tradition, the\nprofound reasons of which he found in his own instinct. Quite sincerely\nhe ignored foreign thought, for which he had a sort of disdainful\ncondescension,--and was exasperated if a foreigner did not accept his\nlowly position.\n",
                "Christophe saw all that, but, being older and better versed in life, he\ndid not worry about it. If such pride of race could not but be\ninjurious, Christophe was not touched by it: he could appreciate the\nillusions of filial love, and never dreamed of criticising the\nexaggerations of a sacred feeling. Besides, humanity is profited by the\nvain belief of the nations in their mission. Of all the reasons at hand\nfor feeling himself estranged from Emmanuel only one hurt him:\nEmmanuel's voice, which at times rose to a shrill, piercing scream.\nChristophe's ears suffered cruelly. He could not help making a face when\nit happened. He tried to prevent Emmanuel's seeing it. He endeavored to\nhear the music and not the instrument. There was such a beauty of\nheroism shining forth from the crippled poet when he evoked the\nvictories of the mind, the forerunners of other victories, the conquest\nof the air, the \"flying God\" who should upraise the peoples, and, like\nthe star of Bethlehem, lead them in his train, in ecstasies, towards far\ndistant spaces or near revenge. The splendor of these visions of energy\ndid not prevent Christophe's seeing their danger, and foreknowing\nwhither this change and the growing clamor of the new Marseillaise would\nlead. He thought, with a little irony, (with no regret for past or fear\nof the future), that the song would find an echo that the singer could\nnot foresee, and that a day would come when men would sigh for the\nvanished days of the Market-Place.--How free they were then! The golden\nage of liberty! Never would its like be known again. The world was\nmoving on to the age of strength, of health, of virile action, and\nperhaps of glory, but also of harsh authority and narrow order. We shall\nhave called it enough with our prayers, the age of iron, the classic\nage! The great classic ages--Louis XIV. or Napoleon--seem now at a\ndistance the peaks of humanity. And perhaps the nation therein most\nvictoriously realized its ideal State. But go and ask the heroes of\nthose times what they thought of them! Your Nicolas Poussin went to live\nand die in Rome; he was stifled in your midst. Your Pascal, your Racine,\nsaid farewell to the world. And among the greatest, how many others\nlived apart in disgrace, and oppressed! Even the soul of a man like\nMoli\u00e8re hid much bitterness.--For your Napoleon, whom you so greatly\nregret, your fathers do not seem to have had any doubt as to their\nhappiness, and the master himself was under no illusion; he knew that\nwhen he disappeared the world would say: \"Ouf!\"... What a wilderness of\nthought surrounds the _Imperator!_ Over the immensity of the sands,\nthe African sun....\n",
                "Christophe did not say all that was in his mind. A few hints were enough\nto set Emmanuel in a fury, and he did not try the experiment again. But\nit was in vain that he kept his thoughts to himself: Emmanuel knew what\nhe was thinking. More than that, he was obscurely conscious that\nChristophe saw farther than he. And he was only irritated by it. Young\npeople never forgive their elders for forcing them to see what they will\nsee in twenty years' time.\n",
                "Christophe read his heart, and said to himself:\n",
                "\"He is right. Every man his own faith. A man must believe what he\nbelieves. God keep me from disturbing his confidence in the future!\"\n",
                "But his mere presence upset Emmanuel. When two personalities are\ntogether, however hard they try to efface themselves, one always crushes\nthe other, and the other always feels rancor and humiliation. Emmanuel's\npride was hurt by Christophe's superiority in experience and character.\nAnd perhaps also he was keeping back the love which he felt growing in\nhimself for him.\n",
                "He became more and more shy. He locked his door, and did not answer\nletters.--Christophe had to give up seeing him.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "During the first days of July Christophe reckoned up what he had gained\nby his few months' stay in Paris: many new ideas, but few friends.\nBrilliant and derisory successes, in which he saw his own image and the\nimage of his work weakened or caricatured in mediocre minds; and there\nis but scant pleasure in that. And he failed to win the sympathy of\nthose by whom he would have loved to be understood; they had not\nwelcomed his advances; he could not throw in his lot with them, however\nmuch he desired to share their hopes and to be their ally; it was as\nthough their uneasy vanity shunned his friendship and found more\nsatisfaction in having him for an enemy. In short, he had let the tide\nof his own generation pass without passing with it, and the tide of the\nnext generation would have nothing to do with him. He was isolated, and\nwas not surprised, for all his life he had been accustomed to it. But\nnow he thought he had won the right, after this fresh attempt, to return\nto his Swiss hermitage, until he had realized a project which for some\ntime past had been taking shape. As he grew older he was tormented with\nthe desire to return and settle down in his own country. He knew nobody\nthere, and would find even less intellectual kinship than in this\nforeign city: but none the less it was his country: you do not ask those\nof your blood to think your thoughts: between them and you there are a\nthousand secret ties; the senses learned to read in the same book of sky\nand earth, and the heart speaks the same language.\n",
                "He gaily narrated his disappointments to Grazia, and told her of his\nintention of returning to Switzerland: jokingly he asked her permission\nto leave Paris, and assured her that he was going during the following\nweek. But at the end of the letter there was a postscript saying:\n",
                "\"I have changed my mind. My departure is postponed.\"\n",
                "Christophe had entire confidence in Grazia: he gave into her hands the\nsecret of his inmost thoughts. And yet there was a room in his heart of\nwhich he kept the key: it contained the memories which did not belong\nonly to himself, but to those whom he had loved. He kept back everything\nconcerning Olivier. His reserve was not deliberate. The words would not\ncome from his lips whenever he tried to talk to Grazia about Olivier.\nShe had never known him....\n",
                "Now, on the morning when he was writing to his friend, there came a\nknock on the door. He went to open it, cursing at being interrupted. A\nboy of fourteen or fifteen asked for M. Krafft. Christophe gruffly bade\nhim come in. He was fair, with blue eyes, fine features, not very tall,\nwith a slender, erect figure. He stood in front of Christophe, rather\nshyly, and said not a word. Quickly he pulled himself together, and\nraised his limpid eyes, and looked at him with keen interest. Christophe\nsmiled as he scanned the boy's charming face, and the boy smiled too.\n",
                "\"Well?\" said Christophe. \"What do you want?\"\n",
                "\"I came,\" said the boy....\n",
                "(And once more he became confused, blushed, and was silent.)\n",
                "\"I can see that you have come,\" said Christophe, laughing. \"But why have\nyou come? Look at me. Are you afraid of me?\"\n",
                "The boy smiled once more, shook his head, and said:\n",
                "\"No.\"\n",
                "\"Bravo! Then tell me who you are.\"\n",
                "\"I am....\" said the boy.\n",
                "He stopped once more. His eyes wandered curiously round the room, and\nlighted on a photograph of Olivier on the mantelpiece.\n",
                "\"Come!\" said Christophe. \"Courage!\"\n",
                "The boy said:\n",
                "\"I am his son.\"\n",
                "Christophe started: he got up from his chair, took hold of the boy's\narm, and drew him to him; he sank back into his chair and held him in a\nclose embrace: their faces almost touched; and he gazed and gazed at\nhim, saying:\n",
                "\"My boy.... My poor boy....\"\n",
                "Suddenly he took his face in his hands and kissed his brow, eyes,\ncheeks, nose, hair. The boy was frightened and shocked by such a violent\ndemonstration, and broke away from him. Christophe let him go. He hid\nhis face in his hand, and leaned his brow against the wall, and sat so\nfor the space of a few moments. The boy had withdrawn to the other end\nof the room. Christophe raised his head. His face was at rest: he looked\nat the boy with an affectionate smile.\n",
                "\"I frightened you,\" he said. \"Forgive me.... You see, I loved him.\"\n",
                "The boy was still frightened, and said nothing.\n",
                "\"How like you are to him!\" said Christophe.... \"And yet I should not\nhave recognized you. What is it that has changed?...\"\n",
                "He asked:\n",
                "\"What is your name?\"\n",
                "\"Georges.\"\n",
                "\"Oh! yes. I remember. Christophe Olivier Georges.... How old are you?\"\n",
                "\"Fourteen.\"\n",
                "\"Fourteen! Is it so long ago?... It is as though it were yesterday--or\nfar back in the darkness of time.... How like you are to him! The same\nfeatures. It is the same, and yet another. The same colored eyes, but\nnot the same eyes. The same smile, the same lips, but not the same\nvoice. You are stronger. You hold yourself more erect: your face is\nfuller, but you blush just as he used to do. Come, sit down, let us\ntalk. Who sent you to me?\"\n",
                "\"No one.\"\n",
                "\"You came of your own accord? How do you know about me?\"\n",
                "\"People have talked to me about you.\"\n",
                "\"Who?\"\n",
                "\"My mother.\"\n",
                "\"Ah!\" said Christophe. \"Does she know that you came to see me?\"\n",
                "\"No.\"\n",
                "Christophe said nothing for a moment; then he asked:\n",
                "\"Where do you live?\"\n",
                "\"Near the Parc Mon\u00e7eau.\"\n",
                "\"You walked here? Yes? It is a long way. You must be tired.\"\n",
                "\"I am never tired.\"\n",
                "\"Good! Show me your arms.\"\n",
                "(He felt them.)\n",
                "\"You are a strong boy.... What put it into your head to come and see\nme?\"\n",
                "\"My father loved you more than any one.\"\n",
                "\"Did she tell you so?\"\n",
                "(He corrected himself.)\n",
                "\"Did your mother tell you so?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "Christophe smiled pensively. He thought: \"She too!... How they all loved\nhim! Why did they not let him see it?...\"\n",
                "He went on:\n",
                "\"Why did you wait so long before you came?\"\n",
                "\"I wanted to come sooner. But I thought you would not want to see me.\"\n",
                "\"I!\"\n",
                "\"I saw you several weeks ago at the Chevillard concerts: I was with my\nmother, sitting a little away from you: I bowed to you: you looked\nthrough me, and frowned, and took no notice.\"\n",
                "\"I looked at you?... My poor boy, how could you think that?... I did not\nsee you. My eyes are tired. That is why I frown.... You don't think me\nso cruel as that?\"\n",
                "\"I think you could be cruel too, if you wanted to be.\"\n",
                "\"Really?\" said Christophe. \"In that case, if you thought I did not want\nto see you, how did you dare to come?\"\n",
                "\"Because I wanted to see you.\"\n",
                "\"And if I had refused to see you?\"\n",
                "\"I shouldn't have let you do that.\" He said this with a little decided\nair, at once shy and provoking.\n",
                "Christophe burst out laughing, and Georges laughed too.\n",
                "\"You would have sent me packing! Think of that! You rogue!... No,\ndecidedly, you are not like your father.\"\n",
                "A shadow passed over the boy's mobile face.\n",
                "\"You think I am not like him? But you said, just now...? You don't think\nhe would have loved me? You don't love me?\"\n",
                "\"What difference does it make to you whether I love you or not?\"\n",
                "\"A great deal of difference.\"\n",
                "\"Because...?\"\n",
                "\"Because I love you.\"\n",
                "In a moment his eyes, his lips, all his features, took on a dozen\ndifferent expressions, like the shadows of the clouds on an April day\nchasing over the fields before the spring winds. Christophe had the most\nlovely joy in gazing at him and listening to him; it seemed to him that\nall the cares of the past were washed away; his sorrowful experiences,\nhis trials, his sufferings and Olivier's sufferings, all were wiped out:\nhe was born again in this young shoot of Olivier's life.\n",
                "They talked on. Georges knew nothing of Christophe's music until the\nlast few months, but since Christophe had been in Paris, he had never\nmissed a concert at which his work was played. He spoke of it with an\neager expression, his eyes shining and laughing, with the tears not far\nbehind: he was like a lover. He told Christophe that he adored music,\nand that he wanted to be a composer. But after a question or two,\nChristophe saw that the boy knew not even the elements of music. He\nasked about his work. Young Jeannin was at the lyc\u00e9e; he said cheerfully\nthat he was not a good scholar.\n",
                "\"What are you best at? Literature or science?\"\n",
                "\"Very much the same.\"\n",
                "\"What? What? Are you a dunce?\"\n",
                "The boy laughed frankly and said:\n",
                "\"I think so.\"\n",
                "Then he added confidentially:\n",
                "\"But I know that I am not, all the same.\"\n",
                "Christophe could not help laughing.\n",
                "\"Then why don't you work? Aren't you interested in anything?\"\n",
                "\"No. I'm interested in everything.\"\n",
                "\"Well, then, why?\"\n",
                "\"Everything is so interesting that there is no time....\"\n",
                "\"No time? What the devil do you do?\"\n",
                "He made a vague gesture:\n",
                "\"Many things. I play music, and games, and I go to exhibitions. I\nread....\"\n",
                "\"You would do better to read your school-books.\"\n",
                "\"We never read anything interesting in school.... Besides, we travel.\nLast month I went to England to see the Oxford and Cambridge match.\"\n",
                "\"That must help your work a great deal!\"\n",
                "\"Bah! You learn much more that way than by staying at the lyc\u00e9e.\"\n",
                "\"And what does your mother say to that?\"\n",
                "\"Mother is very reasonable. She does whatever I want.\"\n",
                "\"You bad boy!... You can thank your stars I am not your father....\"\n",
                "\"You wouldn't have had a chance....\"\n",
                "It was impossible to resist his banter.\n",
                "\"Tell me, you traveler,\" said Christophe. \"Do you know my country?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "\"I bet you don't know a word of German.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I do. I know it quite well.\"\n",
                "\"Let us see.\"\n",
                "They began to talk German. The boy jabbered on quite ungrammatically\nwith the most droll coolness; he was very intelligent and wide awake,\nand guessed more than he understood: often he guessed wrong; but he was\nthe first to laugh at his mistakes. He talked eagerly about his travels\nand his reading. He had read a great deal, hastily, superficially,\nskipping half the pages, and inventing what he had left unread, but he\nwas always urged on by a keen curiosity, forever seeking reasons for\nenthusiasm. He jumped from one subject to another, and his face grew\nanimated as he talked of plays or books that had moved him. There was no\nsort of order in his knowledge. It was impossible to tell how he could\nread right through a tenth-rate book, and yet know nothing of the\ngreatest masterpieces.\n",
                "\"That is all very well,\" said Christophe. \"But you will never do\nanything if you do not work.\"\n",
                "\"Oh! I don't need to. We are rich.\"\n",
                "\"The devil! Then it is a very serious state of things. Do you want to be\na man who does nothing and is good for nothing?\"\n",
                "\"No. I should like to do everything. It is stupid to shut yourself up\nall your life in a profession.\"\n",
                "\"But it is the only means yet discovered of doing any good.\"\n",
                "\"So they say!\"\n",
                "\"What do you mean? 'So they say!'... I say so. I've been working at my\nprofession for forty years, and I am just beginning to get a glimmer of\nit.\"\n",
                "\"Forty years, to learn a profession! When can you begin to practise it?\"\n",
                "Christophe began to laugh.\n",
                "\"You little disputatious Frenchman!\"\n",
                "\"I want to be a musician,\" said Georges.\n",
                "\"Well, it is not too early for you to begin. Shall I teach you?\"\n",
                "\"Oh! I should be so glad!\"\n",
                "\"Come to-morrow. I'll see what you are worth. If you are worth nothing,\nI shall forbid you ever to lay hands on a piano. If you have a real\ninclination for it, we'll try and make something of you.... But, I warn\nyou, I shall make you work.\"\n",
                "\"I will work,\" said Georges delightedly.\n",
                "They said good-by until the morrow. As he was going, Georges remembered\nthat he had other engagements on the morrow, and also for the day after.\nYes, he was not free until the end of the week. They arranged day and\nhour.\n",
                "But when the day and hour came, Christophe waited in vain. He was\ndisappointed. He had been looking forward with childlike glee to seeing\nGeorges again. His unexpected visit had brightened his life. It had made\nhim so happy, and moved him so much that he had not slept the night\nafter it. With tender gratitude he thought of the young friend who had\nsought him out for his friend's sake. His natural grace, his malicious\nand ingenuous frankness had delighted him: he sank back into the mute\nintoxication, the buzzing of happiness, which had filled his ears and\nhis heart during the first days of his friendship with Olivier. It was\nallied now with a graver and almost religious feeling which, through the\nliving, saw the smile of the past.--He waited all the next day and the\nday after. Nobody came. Not even a letter of excuse. Christophe was very\nmournful, and cast about for excuses for the boy. He did not know where\nto write to him, and he did not know his address. Had he had it he would\nnot have dared to write. When the heart of an older man is filled with\nlove for a young creature, he feels a certain modesty about letting him\nsee the need he has of him: he knows that the young man has not the same\nneed: they are not evenly matched: and nothing is so much dreaded as to\nseem to be imposing oneself on a person who cares not a jot.\n",
                "The silence dragged on. Although Christophe suffered under it, he forced\nhimself to take no step to hunt up the Jeannins. But every day he\nexpected the boy, who never came. He did not go to Switzerland, but\nstayed through the summer in Paris. He thought himself absurd, but he\nhad no taste for traveling. Only when September came did he decide to\nspend a few days at Fontainebleau.\n",
                "About the end of October Georges Jeannin came and knocked at his door.\nHe excused himself calmly, without being in the least put out by his\nlong silence.\n",
                "\"I could not come,\" he said. \"And then we went away to stay in\nBrittany.\"\n",
                "\"You might have written to me,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"Yes. I did try. But I never had the time.... Besides,\" he said,\nlaughing, \"I forgot all about it.\"\n",
                "\"When did you come back?\"\n",
                "\"At the beginning of October.\"\n",
                "\"And it has taken you three weeks to come?... Listen. Tell me frankly:\nDid your mother prevent you?... Does she dislike your seeing me?\"\n",
                "\"No. Not at all. She told me to come to-day.\"\n",
                "\"What?\"\n",
                "\"The last time I saw you before the holidays I told her everything when\nI got home. She told me I had done right, and she asked about you, and\npestered me with a great many questions. When we came home from\nBrittany, three weeks ago, she made me promise to go and see you again.\nA week ago she reminded me again. This morning, when she found that I\nhad not been, she was angry with me, and wanted me to go directly after\nbreakfast, without more ado.\"\n",
                "\"And aren't you ashamed to tell me that? Must you be forced to come and\nsee me?\"\n",
                "\"No. You mustn't think that.... Oh! I have annoyed you. Forgive me.... I\nam a muddle-headed idiot.... Scold me, but don't be angry with me. I\nlove you. If I did not love you I should not have come. I was not forced\nto come. I can't be forced to do anything but what I want to do.\"\n",
                "\"You rascal!\" said Christophe, laughing in spite of himself. \"And your\nmusical projects, what about them?\"\n",
                "\"Oh! I am still thinking about it.\"\n",
                "\"That won't take you very far.\"\n",
                "\"I want to begin now. I couldn't begin these last few months. I have had\nso much to do! But now you shall see how I will work, if you still want\nto have anything to do with me....\"\n",
                "(He looked slyly at Christophe.)\n",
                "\"You are an impostor,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"You don't take me seriously.\"\n",
                "\"No, I don't.\"\n",
                "\"It is too dreadful. Nobody takes me seriously. I lose all heart.\"\n",
                "\"I shall take you seriously when I see you working.\"\n",
                "\"At once, then.\"\n",
                "\"I have no time now. To-morrow.\"\n",
                "\"No. To-morrow is too far off. I can't bear you to despise me for a\nwhole day.\"\n",
                "\"You bore me.\"\n",
                "\"Please!...\"\n",
                "Smiling at his weakness, Christophe made him sit at the piano, and\ntalked to him about music. He asked him many questions, and made him\nsolve several little problems of harmony. Georges did not know much\nabout it, but his musical instinct supplied the gaps of his ignorance;\nwithout knowing their names, he found the chords Christophe wanted; and\neven his mistakes in their awkwardness showed a curiosity of taste and a\nsingularly acute sensibility. He did not accept Christophe's remarks\nwithout discussion; and the intelligent questions he asked in his turn\nbore witness to the sincerity of a mind that would not accept art as a\ndevout formula to be repeated with the lips, but desired to live it for\nits own sake.--They did not only talk of music. In reference to harmony\nGeorges would summon up pictures, the country, people. It was difficult\nto hold him in check: it was constantly necessary to bring him back to\nthe middle of the road: and Christophe had not always the heart to do\nso. It amused him to hear the boy's joyous chatter, so full of wit and\nlife. What a difference there was between his nature and Olivier's! With\nthe one life was a subterranean river that flowed silently; with the\nother all was above ground: a capricious stream disporting itself in the\nsun. And yet it was the same lovely, pure water, like their eyes. With a\nsmile, Christophe recognized in Georges certain instinctive antipathies,\nlikings and dislikings, which he well knew, and the na\u00efve intolerance,\nthe generosity of heart which gives itself entirely to whatsoever it\nloves.... Only Georges loved so many things that he had no time to love\nany one thing for long.\n",
                "He came back the next day and the days following. He was filled with a\nyouthful passion for Christophe, and he worked enthusiastically at his\nlessons....--Then his enthusiasm palled, his visits grew less frequent.\nHe came less and less often. Then he came no more, and disappeared for\nweeks.\n",
                "He was light-hearted, forgetful, na\u00efvely selfish, and sincerely\naffectionate; he had a good heart and a quick intelligence which he\nexpended piecemeal day by day. People forgave him everything because\nthey were so glad to see him; he was happy....\n",
                "Christophe refused to judge him. He did not complain. He wrote to\nJacqueline to thank her for having sent her son to him. Jacqueline\nreplied with a short letter filled with restrained emotion: she\nexpressed a hope that Christophe would be interested in Georges and help\nhim in his life. Through shame and pride she could not bring herself to\nsee him again. And Christophe thought he could not visit her without\nbeing invited.--So they stayed apart, seeing each other at a distance at\nconcerts, bound together only by the boy's infrequent visits.\n",
                "The winter passed. Grazia wrote but seldom. She was still faithful in\nher friendship for Christophe. But, like a true Italian, she was hardly\nat all sentimental, attached to reality, and needed to see people if she\nwere, perhaps not to think of them, but certainly to take pleasure in\ntalking to them. Her heart's memory needed to be supported by having her\nsight's memory refreshed from time to time. Her letters became brief and\ndistant. She was as sure of Christophe as Christophe was of her. But\ntheir security gave out more light than warmth.\n",
                "Christophe did not feel his new disappointments very keenly. His musical\nactivity was enough to fill his life. When he reaches a certain age a\nvigorous artist lives much more in his art than in his life; his life\nhas become the dream, his art the reality. His creative powers had been\nreawakened by contact with Paris. There is no stronger stimulant in the\nworld than the sight of that city of work. The most phlegmatic natures\nare touched by its fever. Christophe, being rested by years of healthy\nsolitude, brought to his work an enormous accumulation of force.\nEnriched by the new conquests forever being made in the fields of\nmusical technique by the intrepid curiosity of the French, he hurled\nhimself in his turn along the road to discovery: being more violent and\nbarbarous than they, he went farther. But nothing in his new audacities\nwas left to the hazardous mercies of his instinct. Christophe had begun\nto feel the need of clarity; all his life his genius had obeyed the\nrhythm of alternate currents: it was its law to pass from one pole to\nthe other, and to fill everything between them. Having greedily\nsurrendered in his last period to _\"the eyes of chaos shining through\nthe veil of order,\"_ even to rending the veil so as to see them more\nclearly, he was now striving to tear himself away from their\nfascination, and once more to throw over the face of the sphinx the\nmagic net of the master mind. The imperial inspiration of Rome had\npassed over him. Like the Parisian art of that time, by the spirit of\nwhich he was infected, he was aspiring to order. But not--like the\nreactionaries who spent what was left of their energies in protecting\ntheir slumber--to order in Varsovia; the good people who are always\ngoing back to Brahms--the Brahmses of all the arts, the thematics, the\ninsipid neo-classics, in search of solace! Might one not say that they\nare enfeebled with passion! You are soon done for, my friends.... No, it\nis not of your order that I speak. Mine has no kinship with yours. Mine\nis the order in harmony of the free passions and the free will....\nChristophe was studying how in his art to maintain the just balance\nbetween the forces of life. These new chords, the new musical daimons\nthat he had summoned from the abyss of sounds, were used to build clear\nsymphonies, vast, sunlit buildings, like the Italian cupola'd basilicas.\n",
                "These plays and battles of the mind occupied him all winter. And the\nwinter passed quickly, although, in the evening, as he ended his day's\nwork and looked behind him at the tale of days, he could not have told\nwhether it had been long or short, or whether he was still young or very\nold.\n",
                "Then a new ray of human sunshine pierced the veil of his dreams, and\nonce more brought in the springtime. Christophe received a letter from\nGrazia, telling him that she was coming to Paris with her two children.\nFor a long time she had planned to do so. Her cousin Colette had often\ninvited her. Her dread of the effort necessary to interrupt her habits\nand to tear herself away from her careless tranquillity and the home she\nloved in order to plunge into the Parisian whirligig that she knew so\nwell, had made her postpone the journey from year to year. This spring\nshe was filled with melancholy, perhaps with a secret\ndisappointment--(how many unspoken romances there are in the heart of a\nwoman, unknown to others, often unconfessed to herself!)--and she longed\nto go right away from Rome. A threatened epidemic gave her an excuse for\nhurrying on her children's departure. She followed her letter to\nChristophe in a very few days.\n",
                "Christophe hastened to her as soon as he heard she was at Colette's. He\nfound her still absorbed and distant. He was hurt, but did not show it.\nBy now he was almost rid of his egoism, and that gave him the insight of\naffection. He saw that she had some grief which she wished to conceal,\nand he suppressed his longing to know its nature. Only he strove to keep\nher amused by giving her a gay account of his misadventures and sharing\nwith her his work and his plans, and he wrapped her round with his\naffection. Her mournful heart rested in the heart of her friend, and he\nspoke to her always of things other than that which was in both their\nminds. And gradually he saw the shadow of melancholy fade from her eyes,\nand their expression became nearly, and ever more nearly, intimate. So\nmuch so, that one day, as he was talking to her, he stopped suddenly,\nand in silence looked at her.\n",
                "\"What is it?\" she asked.\n",
                "\"To-day,\" he said, \"you have come back to me.\"\n",
                "She smiled, and in a low voice she replied:\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "It was not easy for them to talk quietly together. They were very rarely\nalone. Colette gave them the pleasure of her presence more often than\nthey wished. In spite of her eccentricities she was extremely kind and\nsincerely attached to Grazia and Christophe; but she never dreamed that\nshe could be a nuisance to them. She had, of course, noticed--(for her\neyes saw everything)--what she was pleased to call Christophe's\nflirtation with Grazia; flirtation was her element, and she was\ndelighted, and asked nothing better than to encourage it. But that was\nprecisely what she was not required to do; she was only desired not to\nmeddle with things that did not concern her. It was enough for her to\nappear or to make an (indiscreet) discreet allusion to their friendship\nto one of them, to make Christophe and Grazia freeze and turn the\nconversation. Colette cast about among all the possible reasons, except\none, and that the true one, for their reserve. Fortunately for them, she\ncould never stay long. She was always coming and going, coming in, going\nout, superintending everything in her house, doing a dozen things at a\ntime. In the intervals between her appearances Christophe and Grazia,\nleft alone with the children, would resume the thread of their innocent\nconversation. They never spoke of the feelings that bound them together.\nUnrestrainedly they confided to each other their little daily\nhappenings. Grazia, with feminine interest, inquired into Christophe's\ndomestic affairs. They were in a very bad way: he was always having\nruptures with his housekeepers; he was continually being cheated and\nrobbed by his servants. She laughed heartily but very kindly, and with\nmotherly compassion for the great child's small practical sense. One\nday, when Colette left them after a longer visitation than usual, Grazia\nsighed:\n",
                "\"Poor Colette! I love her dearly.... But how she bores me!\"\n",
                "\"I love her too,\" said Christophe, \"if you mean by that that she bores\nus.\"\n",
                "Grazia laughed:\n",
                "\"Listen. Will you let me ... (it is quite impossible for us to talk in\npeace here) ... will you let me come to your house one day?\"\n",
                "He could hardly speak.\n",
                "\"To my house! You will come?\"\n",
                "\"If you don't mind?\"\n",
                "\"Mind! Mercy, no!\"\n",
                "\"Well, then, will you let me come on Tuesday?\"\n",
                "\"Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, any day you like.\"\n",
                "\"Tuesday, at four. It is agreed?\"\n",
                "\"How good of you! How good of you!\"\n",
                "\"Wait. There is a condition.\"\n",
                "\"A condition? Why? Anything you like. You know that I will do it,\ncondition or no condition.\"\n",
                "\"I would rather make a condition.\"\n",
                "\"I promise.\"\n",
                "\"You don't know what it is.\"\n",
                "\"I don't care. I promise. Anything you like.\"\n",
                "\"But listen. You are so obstinate.\"\n",
                "\"Tell me!\"\n",
                "\"The condition is that between now and then you make no change in your\nrooms--none, you understand; everything must be left exactly as it is.\"\n",
                "Christophe's face fell. He looked abject.\n",
                "\"Ah! That's not playing the game.\"\n",
                "\"You see, that's what comes of giving your word too hastily! But you\npromised.\"\n",
                "\"But why do you want--?\n",
                "\"But I want to see you in your rooms as you are, every day, when you are\nnot expecting me.\"\n",
                "\"Surely you will let me--\"\n",
                "\"Nothing at all. I shall allow nothing.\"\n",
                "\"At least--\"\n",
                "\"No, no, no! I won't listen to you, or else I won't come, if you prefer\nit--\"\n",
                "\"You know I would agree to anything if you will only come.\"\n",
                "\"Then you promise.\"\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "\"On your word of honor?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, you tyrant.\"\n",
                "\"A good tyrant.\"\n",
                "\"There is no such thing as a good tyrant: there are tyrants whom one\nloves and tyrants whom one detests.\"\n",
                "\"And I am both?\"\n",
                "\"No. You are one of the first.\"\n",
                "\"It is very humiliating.\"\n",
                "On the appointed day she came. With scrupulous loyalty Christophe had\nnot dared even to arrange the smallest piece of paper in his untidy\nrooms: he would have felt dishonored had he done so. But he was in\ntorture. He was ashamed of what his friend would think. Anxiously he\nawaited her arrival. She came punctually, not more than four or five\nminutes after the hour. She climbed up the stairs with her light, firm\nstep. She rang. He was at the door and opened it. She was dressed with\neasy, graceful elegance. Through her veil he could see her tranquil\neyes. They said \"Good-day\" in a whisper and shook hands; she was more\nsilent than usual: he was awkward and emotional and said nothing, to\navoid showing his feeling. He led her in without uttering the sentence\nhe had prepared by way of excusing the untidiness of his room. She sat\ndown in the best chair, and he sat near her.\n",
                "\"This is my work-room.\"\n",
                "It was all he could find to say to her.\n",
                "There was a silence. She looked round slowly, with a kindly smile, and\nshe, too, was much moved, though she would not admit it to herself.\n(Later she told him that when she was a girl she had thought of coming\nto him, but had been afraid as she reached the door.) She was struck by\nthe solitary aspect and the sadness of the place: the dark, narrow hall,\nthe absolute lack of comfort, the visible poverty, all went to her\nheart: she was filled with affectionate pity for her old friend, who, in\nspite of all his work and his sufferings and his celebrity, was unable\nto shake free of material anxiety. And at the same time she was amused\nat the absolute indifference revealed by the bareness of the room that\nhad no carpets, no pictures, no bric-a-brac, no armchair; no other\nfurniture than a table, three hard chairs, and a piano: and papers,\npapers everywhere, mixed up with books, on the table, under the table,\non the floor, on the piano, on the chairs--(she smiled as she thought\nhow conscientiously he had kept his word).\n",
                "After a minute or two she asked him, pointing to his place at the table:\n",
                "\"Is that where you work?\"\n",
                "\"No,\" he said. \"There.\"\n",
                "He pointed to the darkest corner of the room, where there stood a low\nchair with its back to the light. She went and sat in it quietly,\nwithout a word. For a few minutes they were silent, for they knew not\nwhat to say. He got up and went to the piano. He played and improvised\nfor half an hour; all around him he felt the presence of his beloved and\nan immense happiness filled his heart; with eyes closed he played\nmarvelous things. Then she understood the beauty of the room, all\nfurnished with divine harmonies: she heard his loving, suffering heart\nas though it were beating in her own bosom.\n",
                "When the music had died away, he stopped for a little while, quite\nstill, at the piano; then he turned as he heard the breath of his\nbeloved and knew that she was weeping. She came to him.\n",
                "\"Thank you!\" she murmured, and took his hand.\n",
                "Her lips were trembling a little. She closed her eyes. He did the same.\nFor a few seconds they remained so, hand in hand; and time stopped; it\nseemed to them that for ages, ages, they had been lying pressed close\ntogether.\n",
                "She opened her eyes, and to shake off her emotion, she asked:\n",
                "\"May I see the rest of the flat?\"\n",
                "Glad also to escape from his emotions, he opened the door into the next\nroom; but at once he was ashamed. It contained a narrow, hard iron bed.\n",
                "On the wall there was a cast of the mask of Beethoven, and near the bed,\nin a cheap frame, photographs of his mother and Olivier. On the\ndressing-table was another photograph: Grazia herself as a child of\nfifteen. He had found it in her album in Rome, and had stolen it. He\nconfessed it, and asked her to forgive him. She looked at the face, and\nsaid:\n",
                "\"Can you recognize me in it?\"\n",
                "\"I can recognize you, and remember you.\"\n",
                "\"Which of the two do you love best?\" she asked, pointing to herself.\n",
                "\"You are always the same. I love you always just the same. I recognize\nyou everywhere. Even in the photograph of you as a tiny child. You do\nnot know the emotion I feel as in this chrysalis I discern your soul.\nNothing so clearly assures me that you are eternal. I loved you before\nyou were born, and I shall love you ever after....\"\n",
                "He stopped. She stood still and made no answer: she was filled with the\nsweet sorrow of love. When she returned to the work-room, and he had\nshown her through the window his little friendly tree, full of chattering\nsparrows, she said:\n",
                "\"Now, do you know what we will do? We will have a feast. I brought tea\nand cakes because I knew you would have nothing of the kind. And I\nbrought something else. Give me your overcoat.\"\n",
                "\"My overcoat?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. Give it me.\"\n",
                "She took needles and cotton from her bag.\n",
                "\"What are you going to do?\"\n",
                "\"There were two buttons the other day which made me tremble for their\nfate. Where are they now?\"\n",
                "\"True. I never thought of sewing them on. It is so tiresome!\"\n",
                "\"Poor boy! Give it me.\"\n",
                "\"I am ashamed.\"\n",
                "\"Go and make tea.\"\n",
                "He brought the kettle and the spirit-lamp into the room, so as not to\nmiss a moment of his friend's stay. As she sewed she watched his clumsy\nways stealthily and maliciously. They drank their tea out of cracked\ncups, which she thought horrible, dodging the cracks, while he\nindignantly defended them, because they reminded him of his life with\nOlivier.\n",
                "Just as she was going, he asked:\n",
                "\"You are not angry with me?\"\n",
                "\"Why should I be?\"\n",
                "\"Because of the litter here?\"\n",
                "She laughed.\n",
                "\"I will make it tidy.\"\n",
                "As she reached the threshold and was just going to open the door, he\nknelt and kissed her feet.\n",
                "\"What are you doing?\" she said. \"You foolish, foolish dear! Good-by!\"\n",
                "They agreed that she should come once a week on a certain day. She had\nmade him promise that there should be no more outbursts, no more\nkneelings, no more kissing of her feet. She breathed forth such a gentle\ntranquillity, that even when Christophe was in his most violent mood, he\nwas influenced by it; and although when he was alone, he often thought\nof her with passionate desire, when they were together they were always\nlike good comrades. Never did word or gesture escape him which could\ndisturb his friend's peace.\n",
                "On Christophe's birthday she dressed her little girl as she herself had\nbeen when they first met in the old days; and she made the child play\nthe piece that Christophe used to make her play.\n",
                "But all her grace and tenderness and sweet friendship were mingled with\ncontradictory feelings. She was frivolous, and loved society, and\ndelighted in being courted, even by fools; she was a coquette, except\nwith Christophe,--even with Christophe. When he was very tender with\nher, she would be deliberately cold and reserved. When he was cold and\nreserved she would become tender and tease him affectionately. She was\nthe most honest of women. But even in the most honest and the best of\nwomen there is always a girl. She insisted on standing well with the\nworld, and conformed to the conventions. She had fine musical gifts, and\nunderstood Christophe's work; but she was not much interested in\nit--(and he knew it).--To a true Latin woman, art is of worth only in\nproportion as it leads back to life, to life and love.... The love which\nis forever seething, slumbering, in the depths of the voluptuous\nbody.... What has she to do with the tragic meditations, the tormented\nsymphonies, the intellectual passions of the North? She must have music\nin which her hidden desires can unfold, with the minimum of effort, an\nopera, which is passionate life without the fatigue of the passions, a\nsentimental, sensual, lazy art.\n",
                "She was weak and changing: she could only apply herself intermittently\nto any serious study: she must have amusement; rarely did she do on the\nmorrow what she had decided to do the night before. She had so many\nchildish ways, so many little disconcerting caprices! The restless\nnature of woman, her morbid and periodically unreasonable character. She\nknew it and then tried to isolate herself. She knew her weaknesses, and\nblamed herself for her failure to resist them, since they distressed her\nfriend; sometimes, without his knowing it, she made real sacrifices for\nhim; but, when all was told, her nature was the stronger. For the rest,\nGrazia could not bear Christophe to seem to be commanding her; and, once\nor twice, by way of asserting her independence, she did the opposite of\nwhat he asked her. At once she regretted it; at night she would be\nfilled with remorse that she could not make Christophe happier; she\nloved him more than she would let him see; she felt that her friendship\nwith him was the best part of her life. As usually happens with two very\ndifferent people, they were more united when they were not together. In\ntruth, if they had been thrust apart by a misunderstanding, the fault\nwas not altogether Christophe's, as he honestly believed. Even when in\nthe old days Grazia most dearly loved Christophe, would she have married\nhim? She would perhaps have given him her life; but would she have so\ngiven herself as to live all her life with him? She knew (though she did\nnot confess it to Christophe) that she had loved her husband, and, even\nnow, after all the harm he had done her, loved him as she had never\nloved Christophe.... The secrets of the heart, the secrets of the body,\nof which one is not very proud, and hides from those dear to one, as\nmuch out of respect for them, as in complacent pity for oneself....\nChristophe was too masculine to divine them: but every now and then, in\nflashes, he would see how little the woman he most dearly loved, who\ntruly loved him, belonged to him--and that he could not wholly count on\nany one, on any one, in life. His love was not quenched by this\nperception. He even felt no bitterness. Grazia's peace spread over him.\nHe accepted everything. O life why should I reproach thee for that which\nthou canst not give? Art thou not very beautiful and very blessed as\nthou art? I must fain love thy smile, Gioconda....\n",
                "Christophe would gaze at his beloved's beautiful face, and read in it\nmany things of the past and the future. During the long years when he\nhad lived alone, traveling, speaking little but seeing much, he had\nacquired, almost unconsciously, the power of reading the human face,\nthat rich and complex language formed by the ages. It is a thousand\ntimes richer and more complex than the spoken language. The spirit of\nthe race is expressed in it.... There are perpetual contrasts between\nthe lines of the face and the words that come from it. Take the profile\nof a girl, clear-cut, a little hard, in the Burne-Jones style, tragic,\nconsumed by a secret passion, jealousy, a Shakespearian sorrow.... She\nspeaks: and, behold, she is a little bourgeois creature, as stupid as an\nowl, a selfish, commonplace coquette, with no idea of the terrible\nforces inscribed upon her body. And yet such passion, such violence are\nin her. In what shape will they one day spring forth? Will it be in the\nlust of gain, conjugal jealousy, or splendid energy, or morbid\nwickedness? There is no knowing. It may be that she will transmit them\nto another creature of her blood before the time comes for the eruption.\nBut it is an element with which we have to reckon as, like a fatality,\nit hovers above the race.\n",
                "Grazia also bore the weight of that uneasy heritage, which, of all the\npatrimony of ancient families, is the least in danger of being\ndissipated in transit. She, at least, was aware of it. It is a great\nsource of strength to know our weakness, to make ourselves, if not the\nmasters, the pilots of the soul of the race to which we are bound, which\nbears us like a vessel upon its waters,--to make fate our instrument, to\nuse it as a sail which we furl or clew up according to the wind. When\nGrazia closed her eyes, she could hear within herself more than one\ndisturbing voice, of a tone familiar to her. But in her healthy soul\neven the dissonances were blended to form a profound, soft music, under\nthe guiding hand of her harmonious reason.\n",
                "Unhappily it is not within our power to transmit the best of our blood\nto the creatures of our blood.\n",
                "Of Grazia's two children, the little girl, Aurora, who was eleven years\nold, was like her mother; she was not so pretty, being a little coarser\nin fiber; she had a slight limp; she was a good little girl,\naffectionate and gay, with splendid health, abundant good nature, few\nnatural gifts, except idleness, a passion for doing nothing. Christophe\nadored her. When he saw her with Grazia he felt the charm of a twofold\ncreature, seen at two ages of life, two generations together.... Two\nflowers upon one stem; a Holy Family of Leonardo, the Virgin and Saint\nAnne, different shades of the same smile. With one glance he could take\nin the whole blossoming of a woman's soul; and it was at once fair and\nsad to see: he could see whence it came and whither it was going. There\nis nothing more natural than for an ardent, chaste heart to love two\nsisters at one and the same time, or mother and daughter. Christophe\nwould have loved the woman of his love through all her descendants, just\nas in her he loved the stock of which she came. Her every smile, her\nevery tear, every line in her face, were they not living beings, the\nmemories of a life which was before her eyes opened to the light, the\nforerunners of a life which was to come, when her eyes should be forever\nclosed?\n",
                "The little boy, Lionello, was nine. He was much handsomer than his\nsister, of a finer stock, too fine, worn out and bloodless, wherein he\nwas like his father. He was intelligent, well-endowed with bad\ninstincts, demonstrative, and dissembling. He had big blue eyes, long,\ngirlish, fair hair, a pale complexion, a delicate chest, and was\nmorbidly nervous, which last, being a born comedian and strangely\nskilled in discovering people's weaknesses, he upon occasion turned to\ngood account. Grazia was inclined to favor him, with the natural\npreference of a mother for her least healthy child,--and also through\nthe attraction which all kindly, good women feel for the sons who are\nneither well nor ill (for in them a part of their life which they have\nsuppressed finds solace). In such attraction there is something of the\nmemory of the husbands who have made them suffer, whom they loved even\nwhile they despised them, or the strange flora of the soul, which wax\nstrong in the dark, humid hot-house of conscience.\n",
                "In spite of Grazia's care equally to bestow her tenderness upon her\nchildren, Aurora felt the difference, and was a little hurt by it.\nChristophe divined her feeling, and she divined Christophe's: they came\ntogether instinctively; while between Christophe and Lionello there was\nan antipathy which the boy covered up with exaggerated, lisping,\ncharming ways,--and Christophe thrust from him as a shameful feeling. He\nwrestled with himself and forced himself to cherish this other man's\nchild as though he were the child whom it would have been ineffably\nsweet for him to have had by the beloved. He would not allow himself to\nsee Lionello's bad nature or anything that could remind him of the\n\"other man\": he set himself to find in him only Grazia. She, more\nclear-sighted, was under no illusions about her son, and she only loved\nhim the more.\n",
                "However, the disease which for years had been lying dormant in the boy\nbroke out. Consumption supervened. Grazia resolved to go and shut\nherself up in a sanatorium in the Alps with Lionello, Christophe begged\nto be allowed to go with her. To avoid scandal she dissuaded him. He was\nhurt by the excessive importance which she attached to the conventions.\nShe went away and left her daughter with Colette. It was not long before\nshe began to feel terribly lonely among the sick people who talked of\nnothing but their illness, surrounded by the pitiless mountains rising\nabove the rags and tatters of men. To escape from the depressing\nspectacle of the invalids with their spittoons spying upon each other\nand marking the progress of death over each one of them, she left the\nPalace hospital, and took a chalet, where she lived aloof with her own\nlittle invalid. Instead of improving Lionello's condition, the high\naltitude aggravated it. His fever waxed greater. Grazia spent nights of\nanguish. Christophe knew it by his keen intuition, although she told him\nnothing: for she was growing more and more rigid in her pride; she\nlonged for Christophe to be with her, but she had forbidden him to\nfollow her, and she could not bring herself to confess: \"I am too weak,\nI need you....\"\n",
                "One evening, as she stood in the veranda of the chalet in the twilight\nhour, which is so bitter for hearts in agony, she saw ... she thought she\nsaw coming up from the station of the funicular railway ... a man walking\nhurriedly: he stopped, hesitating, with his back a little bowed. She\nwent indoors to avoid his seeing her: she held her hands over her heart,\nand, quivering with emotion, she laughed. Although she was not at all\nreligious she knelt down, hid her face in her hands; she felt the need\nof thanking some one.... But he did not come. She went back to the\nwindow, and, hiding behind the curtains, looked out. He had stopped,\nleaning against a fence round a field, near the gate of the chalet. He\ndared not enter. And, even more perturbed than he, she smiled, and said\nin a low voice:\n",
                "\"Come....\"\n",
                "At last he made up his mind and rang the bell. Already she was at the\ndoor, and she opened it. His eyes looked at her like the eyes of a\nfaithful dog, who is afraid of being beaten. He said:\n",
                "\"I came.... Forgive me....\"\n",
                "She said:\n",
                "\"Thank you.\"\n",
                "Then she confessed how she had expected him. Christophe helped her to\nnurse the boy, whose condition was growing worse. His heart was in the\ntask. The boy treated him with irritable animosity: he took no pains now\nto conceal it: he said many malicious things to him. Christophe put it\nall down to his illness. He was extraordinarily patient. He passed many\npainful days by the boy's bedside, until the critical night, on passing\nthrough which, Lionello, whom they had given up for lost, was saved. And\nthey felt then such pure happiness--watching hand in hand over the\nlittle invalid--that suddenly she got up, took her cloak and hood, and\nled Christophe out of doors, along the road, in the snow, the silence\nand the night, under the cold stars. Leaning on his arm, excitedly\nbreathing in the frozen peace of the world, they hardly spoke at all.\nThey made no allusion to their love. Only when they returned, on the\nthreshold, she said: \"My dear, dear friend!...\"\n",
                "And her eyes were lit up by the happiness of having saved her child.\nThat was all. But they felt that the bond between them had become\nsacred.\n",
                "On her return to Paris after Lionello's long convalescence, she took a\nlittle house at Passy, and did not worry any more about \"avoiding\nscandal\": she felt brave enough to dare opinion for her friend's sake.\nTheir life henceforth was so intimately linked that it would have seemed\ncowardly to her to conceal the friendship which united them at\nthe--inevitable--risk of having it slandered. She received Christophe at\nall hours of the day, and was seen with him out walking and at the\ntheater: she spoke familiarly to him in company. Colette thought they\nwere making themselves too conspicuous. Grazia would stop her hints with\na smile, and quietly go her way.\n",
                "And yet she had given Christophe no new right over her. They were\nnothing more than friends: he always addressed her with the same\naffectionate respect. But they hid nothing from each other: they\nconsulted each other about everything: and insensibly Christophe assumed\na sort of paternal authority in the house: Grazia listened to and\nfollowed his advice. She was no longer the same woman since the winter\nshe had spent in the sanatorium; the anxiety and fatigue had seriously\ntried her health, which, till then, had been sturdy. Her soul was\naffected by it. In spite of an occasional lapse into her old caprices,\nshe had become mysteriously more serious, more reflective, and was more\nconstantly desirous of being kind, of learning and not hurting any one.\nEvery day saw her more softened by Christophe's affection, his\ndisinterestedness, and the purity of his heart: and she was thinking of\none day giving him the great happiness of which he no longer dared to\ndream, that of becoming his wife.\n",
                "He had never broached the subject again after her first refusal, for he\nthought he had no right to do so. But regretfully he clung to his\nimpossible hope. Though he respected what his friend had said, he was\nnot convinced by her disillusioned attitude towards marriage: he\npersisted in believing that the union of two people who love each other,\nprofoundly and devotedly, is the height of human happiness.--His regrets\nwere revived by coming in contact once more with the Arnauds.\n",
                "Madame Arnaud was more than fifty. Her husband was sixty-five or\nsixty-six. Both seemed to be older. He had grown stout: she was very\nthin and rather shrunken: spare though she had been in the old days, she\nwas now just a wisp of a woman. After Arnaud's retirement they had gone\nto live in a house in the country. They had no link with the life of the\ntime save the newspaper, which in the torpor of their little town and\ntheir drowsy life brought them the tardy echo of the voice of the world.\nOnce they saw Christophe's name. Madame Arnaud wrote him a few\naffectionate, rather ceremonious words, to tell him how glad they were\nof his fame. He took the train at once without letting them know.\n",
                "He found them in the garden, dozing under the round canopy of an ash, on\na warm summer afternoon. They were like Boecklin's old couple, sleeping\nhand in hand, in an arbor. Sun, sleep, old age overwhelm them: they are\nfalling, they are already half-buried in the eternal dream. And, as the\nlast gleam of their life, their tenderness persists to the end. The\nclasp of their hands, the dying warmth of their bodies....--They were\ndelighted to see Christophe, for the sake of all the memories of the\npast he brought with him. They talked of the old days, which at that\ndistance seemed brilliant and full of light.\n",
                "Arnaud loved talking, but he had lost his memory for names. Madame\nArnaud whispered them to him. She liked saying nothing and preferred\nlistening to talking: but the image of the old times had been kept alive\nand clear in her silent heart: in glimmers they would appear sharply\nbefore her like shining pebbles in a stream. There was one such memory\nthat Christophe more than once saw reflected in her eyes as she looked\nat him with affectionate compassion: but Olivier's name was not\npronounced. Old Arnaud plied his wife with touching, awkward little\nattentions; he was fearful lest she should catch cold, or be too hot; he\nwould gaze hungrily with anxious love at her dear, faded face, and with\na weary smile she would try to reassure him. Christophe watched them\ntenderly, with a little envy.... To grow old together. To love in the\ndear companion even the wear of time. To say: \"I know those lines round\nher eyes and nose. I have seen them coming. I know when they came. Her\nscant gray hair has lost its color, day by day, in my company, something\nbecause of me, alas! Her sweet face has swollen and grown red in the\nfires of the weariness and sorrow that have consumed us. My soul, how\nmuch better I love thee for that thou hast suffered and grown old with\nme. Every one of thy wrinkles is to me as music from the past....\" The\ncharm of these old people, who, after the long vigil of life, spent side\nby side, go side by side to sleep in the peace of the night! To see them\nwas both sweet and profitable and sorrowful for Christophe. Oh! How\nlovely had life and death been thus!...\n",
                "When he next saw Grazia, he could not help telling her of his visit. He\ndid not tell her of the thoughts roused in him by his visit. But she\ndivined them. He was tender and wistful as he spoke. He turned his eyes\naway from her and was silent every now and then. She looked at him and\nsmiled, and Christophe's unease infected her.\n",
                "That evening, when she was alone in her room, she lay dreaming. She went\nover the story Christophe had told her; but the image she saw through it\nwas not that of the old couple sleeping under the ash: it was the shy,\nardent dream of her friend. And her heart was filled with love for him.\nShe lay in the dark and thought:\n",
                "\"Yes. It is absurd, criminal and absurd, to waste the opportunity for\nsuch happiness. What joy in the world can equal the joy of making the\nman you love happy?... What! Do I love him?...\"\n",
                "She was silent, deeply moved, listening to the answer of her heart.\n",
                "\"I love him.\"\n",
                "Just then a dry, hard, hasty cough came from the next room where the\nchildren were sleeping. Grazia pricked her ears: since the boy's illness\nshe had always been anxious. She called out to him. He made no reply,\nand went on coughing. She sprang from her bed and went to him. He was\nirritated, and moaned, and said that he was not well, and broke out\ncoughing again.\n",
                "\"What is the matter?\"\n",
                "He did not reply, but only groaned that he was ill.\n",
                "\"My darling, please tell me what is the matter?\"\n",
                "\"I don't know.\"\n",
                "\"Is it here?\"\n",
                "\"Yes. No. I don't know. I am ill all over.\"\n",
                "On that he had a fresh fit of coughing, violent and exaggerated. Grazia\nwas alarmed: she had a feeling that he was forcing himself to cough: but\nshe was ashamed of her thought, as she saw the boy sweating and choking\nfor breath. She kissed him and spoke to him tenderly: he seemed to grow\ncalmer; but as soon as she tried to leave him he broke out coughing\nagain. She had to stay shivering by his bedside, for he would not even\nallow her to go away to dress herself, and insisted on her holding his\nhand; and he would not let her go until he fell asleep again. Then she\nwent to bed, chilled, uneasy, harassed. And she found it impossible to\ngather up the threads of her dreams.\n",
                "The boy had a singular power of reading his mother's thoughts. This\ninstinctive genius is often--though seldom in such a high degree--to be\nfound in creatures of the same stock: they hardly need to look at each\nother to know each other's thoughts: they can guess them by the\nbreathing, by a thousand imperceptible signs. This natural aptness,\nwhich is fortified by living together, was in Lionello sharpened and\nrefined by his ever wakeful malevolence. He had the insight of the\ndesire to hurt. He detested Christophe. Why? Why does a child take a\ndislike to a person who has never done him any harm? It is often a\nmatter of chance. It is enough for a child to have begun by persuading\nhimself that he detests some one, for it to become a habit, and the more\nhe is argued with the more desperately he will cling to it. But often,\nagain, there are deeper reasons for it, which pass the child's\nunderstanding: he has no idea of them.... From the first moment when he\nsaw Christophe, the son of Count Ber\u00e9ny had a feeling of animosity\ntowards the man whom his mother had loved. It was as though he had\ninstinctively felt the exact moment when Grazia began to think of\nmarrying Christophe. From that moment on he never ceased to spy upon\nthem. He was always between them, and refused to leave the room whenever\nChristophe came; or he would manage to burst in upon them when they were\nsitting together. More than that, when his mother was alone, thinking of\nChristophe, he seemed to divine her thoughts. He would sit near her and\nwatch her. His gaze would embarrass her and almost make her blush. She\nwould get up to conceal her unease.--He would take a delight in saying\nunkind things about Christophe in her presence. She would bid him be\nsilent, but he would go on. And if she tried to punish him, he would\nthreaten to make himself ill. That was the strategy he had always used\nsuccessfully since he was a child. When he was quite small, one day when\nhe had been scolded, he had, out of revenge, undressed himself and lain\nnaked on the floor so as to catch cold.--Once, when Christophe brought a\npiece of music that he had composed for Grazia's birthday, the boy took\nthe manuscript and hid it. It was found in tatters in a wood-box. Grazia\nlost her patience and scolded him severely. Then he wept and howled, and\nstamped his feet, and rolled on the ground, and had an attack of nerves.\nGrazia was terrified, and kissed and implored him, and promised to do\nwhatever he wanted.\n",
                "From that day on he was the master: for he knew it: and very frequently\nhe had recourse to the weapon with which he had succeeded. There was\nnever any knowing how far his attacks were natural and how far\ncounterfeit. Soon he was not satisfied with using them vengefully when\nhe was opposed in any way, but took to using them out of spite whenever\nhis mother and Christophe planned to spend the evening together. He even\nwent so far as to play his dangerous game out of sheer idleness, or\ntheatricality, to discover the extent of his power. He was\nextraordinarily ingenious in inventing strange, nervous accidents;\nsometimes in the middle of dinner he would be seized with a convulsive\ntrembling, and upset his glass or break his plate; sometimes, as he was\ngoing upstairs, he would clutch at the banisters with his hand: his\nfingers would stiffen: he would pretend that he could not open them\nagain; or he would have a sharp pain in his side and roll about,\nhowling; or he would choke. Of course, in the end he developed a genuine\nnervous illness. Christophe and Grazia were at their wits' end. Their\npeaceful meetings--their quiet talks, their readings, their music, which\nwere as a festival to them--all their humble happiness was henceforth\ndisturbed.\n",
                "Every now and then, however, the little imp would, give them a respite,\npartly because he was tired of his play-acting, partly because his\nchild's nature took possession of him again, and made him think of\nsomething else. (He was sure now that he had won the day.)\n",
                "Then, quickly, quietly, they would seize their opportunity. Every hour\nthat they could steal in this way was the more precious to them as they\ncould never be sure of enjoying it to the end. How near they felt to\neach other! Why could they not always be so!... One day Grazia herself\nconfessed to her regret. Christophe took her hand.\n",
                "\"Yes. Why?\" he asked.\n",
                "\"You know why, my dear,\" she said, with a miserable smile.\n",
                "Christophe knew. He knew that she was sacrificing their happiness to her\nson: he knew that she was not deceived by Lionello's lies, that she\nstill adored him: he knew the blind egoism of such domestic affections\nwhich make the best pour out their reserves of devotion to the advantage\nof the bad or mediocre creatures of their blood, so that there is\nnothing left for them to give to those who would be more worthy, whom\nthey love best, but who are not of their blood. And although he was\nirritated by it, although there were times when he longed to kill the\nlittle monster who was destroying their lives, yet he bowed his head in\nsilence, and understood that Grazia could not do otherwise.\n",
                "So they renounced their life without vain recrimination. But if the\nhappiness which was their right could be snatched from them, nothing\ncould prevent the union of their hearts. Their very renunciation, their\ncommon sacrifice, held them by bonds stronger than those of the flesh.\nEach confided the sorrow of it all to the other, passed over the burden\nof it, and took on the other's suffering: so even their sorrow became\njoy. Christophe called Grazia \"his confessor.\" He did not hide from her\nthe weaknesses from which his pride had to suffer: rather he accused\nhimself with too great contrition, and she would smilingly soothe his\nboyish scruples. He even confessed to her his material poverty; but he\ncould only bring himself to do that after it had been agreed between\nthem that she should neither offer him, nor he accept from her, any\nhelp. It was the last barrier of pride which he upheld and she\nrespected. In place of the well-being which she could not bring into her\nfriend's life, she found many ways of filling it with what was\ninfinitely more precious to him--namely, her tenderness. He felt the\nbreath of it all about him, during every hour of the day: he never\nopened his eyes in the morning, never closed them at night, without a\nprayer of love and adoration. And when she awoke, or at night, as often\nhappened, lay for hours without sleeping, she thought:\n",
                "\"My dear is thinking of me.\"\n",
                "And a great peace came upon them and surrounded them.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "However, her health had given way. Grazia was constantly in bed, or had\nto spend the day lying on a sofa. Christophe used to go every day and\nread to her, and show her his new work. Then she would get up from the\nchair, and limp to the piano, for her feet were swollen. She would play\nthe music he had brought. It was the greatest joy she could give him. Of\nall his pupils she and C\u00e9cile were the most gifted. But while C\u00e9cile had\nan instinctive feeling for music, with hardly any understanding of it,\nto Grazia it was a lovely harmonious language full of meaning for her.\nThe demoniac quality in life and art escaped her altogether: she brought\nto bear on it the clarity of her intelligence and heart. Christophe's\ngenius was saturated with her clarity. His friend's playing helped him\nto understand the obscure passions he had expressed. With closed eyes he\nwould listen, and follow her, and hold her by the hand, as she led him\nthrough the maze of his own thoughts. By living in his music through\nGrazia's soul, he was wedded to her soul and possessed it. Prom this\nmysterious conjugation sprang music which was the fruit of the mingling\nof their lives. One day, as he brought her a collection of his works,\nwoven of his substance and hers, he said:\n",
                "\"Our children.\"\n",
                "Theirs was an unbroken communion whether they were together or apart;\nsweet were the evenings spent in the peace and quiet of the old house,\nwhich was a fit setting for the image of Grazia, where the silent,\ncordial servants, who were devoted to Christophe, extended to him a\nlittle of the respectful affection they had for their mistress. Joyous\nwas it to listen to the song of the fleeting hours, and to see the tide\nof life ebbing away.... A shadow of anxiety was thrown on their\nhappiness by Grazia's failing health. But, in spite of her little\ninfirmities, she was so serene that her hidden sufferings did but\nheighten her charm. She was his _\"liebe, leidende, und doch so\nr\u00fchrende, heitre Freundin\"_ (\"his dear, suffering, touching friend,\nalways so bright and cheerful\"). And sometimes, in the evening, when he\nleft her with his heart big with love so that he could not wait until\nthe morrow, he would write:\n",
                "\"Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe Grazia....\"\n",
                "Their tranquillity lasted for months. They thought it would last\nforever. The boy seemed to have forgotten them: his attention was\ndistracted by other things. But after this respite he returned to them\nand never left them again. The horrible little boy had determined to\npart his mother and Christophe. He resumed his play-acting. He did not\nset about it upon any premeditated plan, but, from day to day, followed\nthe whimsies of his spite. He had no idea of the harm he might be doing:\nhe only wanted to amuse himself by boring other people. He never relaxed\nhis efforts until he had made Grazia promise to leave Paris and go on a\nlong journey. Grazia had no strength to resist him. Besides, the doctors\nadvised her to pay a visit to Egypt. She had to avoid another winter in\nthe northern climate. Too many things had tried her health: the moral\nupheaval of the last few years, the perpetual anxiety about her son's\nhealth, the long periods of uncertainty, the struggle that had taken\nplace in her without her giving any sign of it, the sorrow of sorrows\nthat she was inflicting on her friend. To avoid adding to the trouble he\ndivined in her, Christophe hid his own grief at the approach of the day\nof parting: he made no effort to postpone it; and they were outwardly\ncalm, and, though inwardly they were very far from it, yet they\nsucceeded in forcing it upon each other.\n",
                "The day came. A September morning. They had left Paris together in the\nmiddle of July, and spent their last weeks in Switzerland in a mountain\nhotel, near the place where they had met again six years ago.\n",
                "They were unable to go out the last five days: the rain came down in\nunceasing torrents: they were almost alone in the hotel, for all the\nother travelers had fled. The rain stopped on their last morning, but\nthe mountains were still covered with clouds. The children went on ahead\nwith the servants in another carriage. She drove off. He accompanied her\nto the place where the road began to descend in steep windings to the\nplain of Italy. The mist came in under the hood of the carriage. They\nwere very close together, and they said no word: they hardly looked at\neach other. A strange light, half-day, half-night, wrapped them\nround.... Grazia's breath left little drops of water on her veil. He\npressed her little hand, warm under her cold glove. Their faces came\ntogether. Through her wet veil he kissed her dear lips.\n",
                "They came to the turn of the road. He got down, and the carriage plunged\non into the mist and disappeared. For a long time he could hear the\nrumbling of the wheels and the horses' hoofs. Great masses of white mist\nrolled over the fields. Through the close tracery of the branches the\ndripping trees dropped water. Not a breath of wind. The mist was\nstifling life. Christophe stopped, choking.... There was nothing now.\nEverything had gone....\n",
                "He took in a long breath, filling his lungs with the mist, and walked\non. Nothing passes for him who does not pass.\n"

                "The correspondence of Christophe and Grazia took on the serious and\nrestrained tone of a couple who are no longer in the dangerous period of\ntrial of love, but, having passed it, feel sure of the road and march on\nhand in hand. Each was strong to sustain and direct the other, weak and\nyielding to the other's support and direction.\n",
                "Christophe returned to Paris. He had vowed never to go there again. But\nwhat are such vows worth? He knew that he would find there the shade of\nGrazia. And circumstances, conspiring with his secret desires against\nhis will, showed him a new duty to fulfil in Paris. Colette, well\ninformed as to society gossip, told Christophe that his young friend\nJeannin was making a fool of himself. Jacqueline, who had always been\nweak in her dealings with her son, could not hold him in check. She\nherself was passing through a strange crisis, and was too much occupied\nwith herself to pay much heed to him.\n",
                "Since the unhappy adventure which had destroyed Olivier's marriage and\nlife, Jacqueline had lived a very worthy life. She withdrew from\nParisian society, which, after imposing on her a hypocritical sort of\nquarantine, had made fresh advances to her, which she had rejected. She\nwas not at all ashamed of what she had done as far as these people were\nconcerned: she thought she had no reason to account to them for it, for\nthey were more worthless than she: what she had done openly, half the\nwomen she knew did by stealth, under cover of their homes. She suffered\nonly from the thought of the wrong she had done her nearest and dearest,\nthe only man she had loved. She could not forgive herself for having, in\nso poor a world, lost an affection like his.\n",
                "Her regrets, and her sorrow, grew less acute with time. There were left\nonly a sort of mute suffering, a humiliated contempt for herself and\nothers, and the love of her child. This affection, into which she poured\nall her need of love, disarmed her before him; she could not resist\nGeorges's caprices. To excuse her weakness she persuaded herself that\nshe was paying for the wrong she had done Olivier. She had alternate\nperiods of exalted tenderness and weary indifference: sometimes she\nwould worry Georges with her exacting, anxious love, and sometimes she\nwould seem to tire of him, and she let him do as he liked. She admitted\nto herself that she was bringing him up badly, and she would torment\nherself with the admission; but she made no change. When, as she rarely\ndid, she tried to model her principles of conduct on Olivier's way of\nthinking, the result was deplorable. At heart she wished to have no\nauthority over her son save that of her affection. And she was not\nwrong: for between these two, however similar they might be, there were\nno bonds save those of the heart. Georges Jeannin was sensible of his\nmother's physical charm: he loved her voice, her gestures, her\nmovements, her grace, her love. But in mind he was conscious of\nstrangerhood to her. She only saw it as he began to grow into a man,\nwhen he turned from her. Then she was amazed and indignant, and\nattributed the estrangement to other feminine influences: and, as she\ntried awkwardly to combat them, she only estranged him more. In reality,\nthey had always lived, side by side, each preoccupied with totally\ndifferent interests, deceiving themselves as to the gulf that lay\nbetween them, with the aid of their common surface sympathies and\nantipathies, which disappeared when the man began to spring forth from\nthe boy (that ambiguous creature, still impregnated with the perfume of\nwomanhood). And bitterly Jacqueline would say to her son:\n",
                "\"I don't know whom you take after. You are not like your father or me.\"\n",
                "So she made him feel all that lay between them; and he took a secret\npride that was yet feverish and uneasy.\n",
                "The younger generation has always a keener sense than the elder of the\nthings that lie between them; they need to gain assurance of the\nimportance of their existence, even at the cost of injustice or of lying\nto themselves. But this feeling varies in its acuteness from one period\nto another. In the classic ages when, for a time, the balance of the\nforces of a civilization are realized,--those high plateaux ending on\nall sides with steep slopes--the difference in level is not so great\nfrom one generation to another. But in the ages of renascence or\ndecadence, the young men climbing or plunging down the giddy slopes,\nleave their predecessors far behind.--Georges, like the other young men\nof his time, was ascending the mountain.\n",
                "He was superior neither in character nor in mind: he had many aptitudes,\nnone of which rose above the level of elegant mediocrity. And yet,\nwithout any effort on his part, he found himself at the outset of his\ncareer several grades higher than his father, who, in his short life,\nhad expended an incalculable amount of intellect and energy.\n",
                "Hardly were the eyes of his mind opened upon the light of day than he\nsaw all round him the heaped-up darkness, pierced by luminous gleams,\nthe masses of knowledge and ignorance, warring truths, contradictory\nerrors, in which his father and the men of his father's generation had\nfeverishly groped their way. But at the same time he became conscious of\na weapon in his power which they had never known: his force....\n",
                "Whence did he have it?... Who can tell the mystery of the resurrections\nof a race, sleeping, worn out, which suddenly awakes brimming like a\nmountain torrent in the spring!... What would he do with his force? Use\nit in his turn to explore the inextricable thickets of modern thought?\nThey had no attraction for him. He was oppressed by the menacing dangers\nwhich lurked in them. They had crushed his father. Rather than renew\nthat experience and enter the tragic forest he would have set fire to\nit. He had only to glance at the books of wisdom or sacred folly which\nhad intoxicated Olivier: the Nihilist pity of Tolstoi, the somber\ndestructive pride of Ibsen, the frenzy of Nietzsche, the heroic, sensual\npessimism of Wagner. He had turned away from them in anger and terror.\nHe hated the realistic writers who, for half a century, had killed the\njoy of art. He could not, however, altogether blot out the shadows of\nthe sorrowful dream in which he had been cradled. He would not look\nbehind him, but he well knew that the shadow was there. He was too\nhealthy to seek a counter-irritant to his uneasiness in the lazy\nskepticism of the preceding epoch: he detested the dilettantism of men\nlike Renan and Anatole France, with their degradation of the free\nintellect, their joyless mirth, their irony without greatness: a\nshameful method, fit for slaves, playing with the chains which they are\nimpotent to break.\n",
                "He was too vigorous to be satisfied with doubt, too weak to create the\nconviction which, with all his soul, he desired. He asked for it, prayed\nfor it, demanded it. And the eternal snappers-up of popularity, the\ngreat writers, the sham thinkers at bay, exploited this imperious and\nagonized desire, by beating the drums and shouting the clap-trap of\ntheir nostrum. From trestles, each of these Hippocrates bawled that his\nwas the only true elixir, and decried all the rest. Their secrets were\nall equally worthless. None of these pedlars had taken the trouble to\nfind a new recipe. They had hunted about among their old empty bottles.\nThe panacea of one was the Catholic Church: another's was legitimate\nmonarchy: yet another's, the classic tradition. There were queer fellows\nwho declared that the remedy for all evils lay in the return to Latin.\nOthers seriously prognosticated, with an enormous word which imposed on\nthe herd, the domination of the Mediterranean spirit. (They would have\nbeen just as ready at some other time to talk of the Atlantic spirit.)\nAgainst the barbarians of the North and the East they pompously set up\nthe heirs of a new Roman Empire.... Words, words, all second-hand. The\nrefuse of the libraries scattered to the winds.--Like all his comrades,\nyoung Jeannin went from one showman to another, listened to their\npatter, was sometimes taken in by it, and entered the booth, only to\ncome out disappointed and rather ashamed of having spent his time and\nhis money in watching old clowns buffooning in shabby rags. And yet,\nsuch is youth's power of illusion, such was his certainty of gaining\ncertainty, that he was always taken in by each new promise of each new\nvendor of hope. He was very French, of a hypercritical temper, and an\ninnate lover of order. He needed a leader and could bear none; his\npitiless irony always riddled them through and through.\n",
                "While he was waiting for the advent of a leader who should give him the\nkey to the riddle ... he had no time to wait. He was not the kind of\nman, like his father, to be satisfied with the lifelong search for\ntruth. With or without a motive, he needed always to make up his mind,\nto act, to turn to account, to use his energy. Traveling, the delight of\nart, and especially of music, with which he had gorged himself, had at\nfirst been to him an intermittent and passionate diversion. He was\nhandsome, ardent, precocious, beset with temptations, and he early\ndiscovered the outwardly enchanting world of love, and plunged into it\nwith an unbridled, poetic, greedy joy. Then this impertinently na\u00efve and\ninsatiable cherub wearied of women: he needed action, so he gave himself\nup uncontrollably to sport. He tried everything, practised everything.\nHe was always going to fencing and boxing matches: he was the French\nchampion runner and high-jumper, and captain of a football team. He\ncompeted with a number of other crazy, reckless, rich young men like\nhimself in ridiculous, wild motor races. Finally he threw up everything\nfor the latest fad, and was drawn into the popular craze for flying\nmachines. At the Rheims meetings he shouted and wept for joy with three\nhundred thousand other men; he felt that he was one with the whole\npeople in a religious jubilation; the human birds flying over their\nheads bore them upwards in their flight: for the first time since the\ndawn of the great Revolution the vast multitude had raised their eyes to\nthe heavens and seen them open.--To his mother's terror young Jeannin\ndeclared that he was going to throw in his lot with the conquerors of\nthe air. Jacqueline implored him to give up his perilous ambition. She\nordered him to do so. He took the bit between his teeth. Christophe, in\nwhom Jacqueline thought she had found an ally, only gave the boy a\nlittle prudent advice, which he felt quite sure Georges would not follow\n(for, in his place, he would not have done so). He did not deem that he\nhad any right,--even had he been able to do so--to fetter the healthy\nand normal expansion of the boy's vitality, which, if it had been forced\ninto inaction, would have been perverted to his destruction.\n",
                "Jacqueline could not reconcile herself to seeing her son leave her. She\nhad vainly thought that she had renounced love, for she could not do\nwithout the illusion of love; all her affections, all her actions were\ntinged with it. There are so many mothers who expend on their sons all\nthe secret ardor which they have been unable to give forth in\nmarriage--or out of it! And when they see how easily their sons do\nwithout them, when suddenly they understand that they are not necessary\nto them, they go through the same kind of crisis as befalls them upon\nthe betrayal of a lover, or the disillusion of love.--Once more\nJacqueline's whole existence crumbled away. Georges saw nothing. Young\npeople never have any idea of the tragedies of the heart going on around\nthem: they have no time to stop and see them: and they do not wish to\nsee: a selfish instinct bids them march straight on without looking to\nright or left.\n",
                "Jacqueline was left alone to gulp down this new sorrow. She only emerged\nfrom it when her grief was worn out, worn out like her love. She still\nloved her son, but with a distant, disillusioned affection, which she\nknew to be futile, and she lost all interest in herself and him. So she\ndragged through a wretched, miserable year, without his paying her any\nheed. And then, poor creature, since her heart could neither live nor\ndie without love, she was forced to find something to love. She fell\nvictim to a strange passion, such as often takes possession of women,\nand especially, it would seem, of the noblest and most inaccessible,\nwhen maturity comes and the fair fruit of life has not been gathered.\nShe made the acquaintance of a woman who, from their first meeting,\ngained an ascendancy over her through her mysterious power of\nattraction.\n",
                "This woman was about her own age, and she was a nun. She was always busy\nwith charitable works. A tall, fine, rather stout woman, dark, with\nrather bold, handsome features, sharp eyes, a big, sensitive,\never-smiling mouth, and a masterful chin. She was remarkably\nintelligent, and not at all sentimental; she had the malice of a\npeasant, a keen business sense, and a southern imagination, which saw\neverything in exaggeration, though always exactly to scale when\nnecessary: she was a strangely enticing mixture of lofty mysticism and\nlawyer's cunning. She was used to domination, and the exercise of it was\na habit with her. Jacqueline was drawn to her at once. She became\nenthusiastic over her work, or, at least, believed herself to be so.\nSister Ang\u00e8le knew perfectly what was the object of her passion: she was\nused to provoking them; and without seeming to notice them, she used\nskilfully to turn them to account for her work and the glory of God.\nJacqueline gave up her money, her will, her heart. She was charitable,\nso she believed, through love.\n",
                "It was not long before her infatuation was observed. She was the only\nperson not to realize it. Georges's guardian became anxious. Georges was\ntoo generous and too easy to worry about money matters, though he saw\nhis mother's subjection, and was shocked by it. He tried, too late in\nthe day, to resume his old intimacy with her, and saw that a veil was\ndrawn between them; he blamed the occult influence for it, and, both\nagainst his mother and the nun, whom he called an intriguer, he\nconceived a feeling of irritation which he made no attempt to disguise:\nhe could not admit a stranger to his place in a heart that he had\nregarded as his natural right. It never occurred to him that his place\nwas taken because he had left it. Instead of trying patiently to win it\nback, he was clumsy and cruel. Quick words passed between mother and\nson, both of whom were hasty and passionate, and the rupture grew\nmarked. Sister Ang\u00e8le established her ascendancy over Jacqueline, and\nGeorges rushed away and kicked over the traces. He plunged into a\nrestless, dissipated life; gambled, lost large sums of money; he put a\ncertain amount of exaggeration into his extravagances, partly for his\nown pleasure and partly to counterbalance his mother's\nextravagances.--He knew the Stevens-Delestrades. Colette had marked down\nthe handsome boy, and tried the effect on him of her charms, which she\nnever wearied of using. She knew of all Georges's freaks, and was vastly\nentertained by them. But her sound common sense and the real kindness\nconcealed beneath her frivolity, helped her to see the danger the young\nidiot was running. And, being well aware that it was beyond her to save\nhim, she warned Christophe, who came at once.\n",
                "Christophe was the only person who had any influence over young Jeannin.\nHis influence was limited and very intermittent, but all the more\nremarkable in that it was difficult to explain. Christophe belonged to\nthe preceding generation against which Georges and his companions were\nviolently in reaction. He was one of the most conspicuous\nrepresentatives of that period of torment whose art and ideas rouse in\nthem a feeling of suspicion and hostility. He was unmoved by the new\nGospels and the charms of the minor prophets and the old cheapjacks who\nwere offering the young men an infallible recipe for the salvation of\nthe world, Rome and France. He was faithful to the free faith, free of\nall religion, free of all parties, free of all countries, which was no\nlonger the fashion--or had never been fashionable. Finally, though he\nwas altogether removed from national questions, he was a foreigner in\nParis at a time when all foreigners were regarded by the natives of the\ncountry as barbarians.\n",
                "And yet, young Jeannin, joyous, easy-going, instinctively hostile to\neverything that might make him sad or uneasy, ardent in pursuit of\npleasure, engrossed in violent sports, easily duped by the rhetoric of\nhis time, in his physical vigor and mental indolence inclined to the\nbrutal doctrines of French action, nationalist, royalist,\nimperialist--(he did not exactly know)--in his heart reflected only one\nman: Christophe. His precocious experience and the delicate tact he had\ninherited from his mother made him see (without being in the least\ndisturbed by it) how little worth was the world that he could not live\nwithout, and how superior to it was Christophe. From Olivier he had\ninherited a vague uneasiness, which visited him in sudden fits that\nnever lasted very long, a need of finding and deciding on some definite\naim for what he was doing. And perhaps it was from Olivier that he had\nalso inherited the mysterious instinct which drew him towards the man whom\nOlivier had loved.\n",
                "He used to go and see Christophe. He was expansive by nature, and of a\nrather chattering temper, and he loved indulging in confidences. He\nnever troubled to think whether Christophe had time to listen to him.\nBut Christophe always did listen, and never gave any sign of impatience.\nOnly sometimes he would be rather absent-minded when Georges had\ninterrupted him in his work, but never for more than a few minutes, when\nhis mind would be away putting the finishing touches to its work: then\nit would return to Georges, who never noticed its absence. He used to\nlaugh at the evasion, and come back like a man tiptoeing into the room,\nso as not to be heard. But once or twice Georges did notice it, and then\nhe said indignantly:\n",
                "\"But you are not listening!\"\n",
                "Then Christophe was ashamed: and docilely he would listen to Georges's\nstory, and try to win his forgiveness by redoubled attention. The\nstories were often very funny: and Christophe could not help laughing at\nthe tale of some wild freak: for Georges kept nothing back: his\nfrankness was disarming.\n",
                "Christophe did not always laugh. Georges's conduct sometimes pained him.\nChristophe was no saint: he knew he had no right to moralize over\nanybody. Georges's love affairs, and the scandalous waste of his fortune\nin folly, were not what shocked him most. What he found it most hard to\nforgive was the light-mindedness with which Georges regarded his sins:\nthey were no burden to him: he thought them very natural. His conception\nof morality was very different from Christophe's. He was one of those\nyoung men who are fain to see in the relation of the sexes nothing more\nthan a game that has no moral aspect whatever. A certain frankness and a\ncareless kindliness were all that was necessary for an honest man. He\nwas not troubled with Christophe's scruples. Christophe would wax wrath.\nIn vain did he try not to impose his way of feeling upon others: he\ncould not be tolerant, and his old violence was only half tamed. Every\nnow and then he would explode. He could not help seeing how dirty were\nsome of Georges's intrigues, and he used bluntly to tell him so. Georges\nwas no more patient than he, and they used to have angry scenes, after\nwhich they would not see each other for weeks. Christophe would realize\nthat his outbursts were not likely to change Georges's conduct, and that\nit was perhaps unjust to subject the morality of a period to the moral\nideas of another generation. But his feeling was too strong for him, and\non the next opportunity he would break out again. How can one renounce\nthe faith for which one has lived? That were to renounce life. What is\nthe good of laboring to think thoughts other than one's own, to be like\none's neighbor or to meddle with his affairs? That leads to\nself-destruction, and no one is benefited by it. The first duty is to be\nwhat one is, to dare to say: \"This is good, that bad.\" One profits the\nweak more by being strong than by sharing their weakness. Be indulgent,\nif you like, towards weakness and past sins. But never compromise with\nany weakness....\n",
                "Yes: but Georges never by any chance consulted Christophe about anything\nhe was going to do:--(did he know himself?).--He only told him about\nthings when they were done.--And then?... Then, what could he do but\nlook in dumb reproach at the culprit, and shrug his shoulders and smile,\nlike an old uncle who knows that he is not heeded?\n",
                "On such occasions they would sit for several minutes in silence. Georges\nwould look up at Christophe's grave eyes, which seemed to be gazing at\nhim from far away. And he would feel like a little boy in his presence.\nHe would see himself as he was, in that penetrating glance, which was\nshot with a gleam of malice: and he was not proud of it.\n",
                "Christophe hardly ever made use of Georges's confidences against him; it\nwas often as though he had not heard them. After the mute dialogue of\ntheir eyes, he would shake his head mockingly, and then begin to tell a\nstory without any apparent bearing on the story he had just been told,\nsome story about his life, or some one else's life, real or fictitious.\nAnd gradually Georges would see his double (he recognized it at once)\nunder a new light, grotesquely, ridiculously postured, passing through\nvagaries similar to his own. Christophe never added any commentary. The\nextraordinary kindliness of the story-teller would produce far more\neffect than the story. He would speak of himself just as he spoke of\nothers, with the same detachment, the same jovial, serene humor. Georges\nwas impressed by his tranquillity. It was for this that he came. When he\nhad unburdened himself of his light-hearted confession, he was like a\nman stretching out his limbs and lying at full length in the shade of a\ngreat tree on a summer afternoon. The dazzling fever of the scorching\nday would fall away from him. Above him he would feel the hovering of\nprotecting wings. In the presence of this man who so peacefully bore the\nheavy burden of his life, he was sheltered from his own inward\nrestlessness. He found rest only in hearing him speak. He did not always\nlisten: his mind would wander, but wheresoever it went, it was\nsurrounded by Christophe's laughter.\n",
                "However, he did not understand his old friend's ideas. He used to wonder\nhow Christophe could bear his soul's solitude, and dispense with being\nbound to any artistic, political, or religious party, or any group of\nmen. He used to ask him: \"Don't you ever want to take refuge in a camp\nof some sort?\"\n",
                "\"Take refuge?\" Christophe would say with a laugh. \"It is much too good\noutside. And you, an open-air man, talk of shutting yourself up?\"\n",
                "\"Ah!\" Georges would reply. \"It is not the same thing for body and soul.\nThe mind needs certainty: it needs to think with others, to adhere to\nthe principles admitted by all the men of the time. I envy the men of\nold days, the men of the classic ages. My friends are right in their\ndesire to restore the order of the past.\"\n",
                "\"Milksop!\" said Christophe. \"What have I to do with such disheartened\ncreatures?\"\n",
                "\"I am not disheartened,\" protested Georges indignantly. \"None of us is\nthat.\"\n",
                "\"But you must be,\" said Christophe, \"to be afraid of yourselves. What!\nYou need order and cannot create it for yourselves? You must always be\nclinging to your great-grandmother's skirts! Dear God! You must walk\nalone!\"\n",
                "\"One must take root,\" said Georges, proudly echoing one of the pontiffs\nof the time.\n",
                "\"But do you think the trees need to be shut up in a box to take root?\nThe earth is there for all of us. Plunge your roots into it. Find your\nown laws. Look to yourself.\"\n",
                "\"I have no time,\" said Georges.\n",
                "\"You are afraid,\" insisted Christophe.\n",
                "Georges indignantly denied it, but in the end he agreed that he had no\ntaste for examining his inmost soul: he could not understand what\npleasure there could be in it: there was the danger of falling over if\nyou looked down into the abyss.\n",
                "\"Give me your hand,\" said Christophe.\n",
                "He would amuse himself by opening the trap-door of his realistic, tragic\nvision of life. Georges would draw away from it, and Christophe would\nshut it down again, laughing:\n",
                "\"How can you live like that?\" Georges would ask.\n",
                "\"I am alive, and I am happy,\" Christophe would reply.\n",
                "\"I should die if I were forced to see things like that always.\"\n",
                "Christophe would slap him on the shoulder:\n",
                "\"Fine athlete you are!... Well, don't look, if your head is not strong\nenough. There is nothing to make you, after all. Go ahead, my boy. But\ndo you need a master to brand your shoulder, like a sheep? What is the\nword of command you are waiting for? The signal was given long ago. The\nsignal to saddle has sounded, and the cavalry is on the march. Don't\nworry about anything but your horse. Take your place! And gallop!\"\n",
                "\"But where to?\" asked Georges.\n",
                "\"With your regiment to the conquest of the world. Conquer the air,\nmaster the elements, dig the last entrenchment of Nature, set back\nspace, drive back death....\n",
                "\"_Expertus vacuum Dadalus aera_....\"\n",
                "\"... Do you know that, you champion of Latin? Can you even tell me what\nit means?\n",
                "\"_Perrupit Acheronta_....\"\n",
                "\"That is your lot, you happy _conquistadores_!\"\n",
                "So clearly did he show the duty of heroic action that had devolved upon\nthe new generation, that Georges was amazed, and said:\n",
                "\"But if you feel that, why don't you come with us?\"\n",
                "\"Because I have a different task. Go, my boy, do your work. Surpass me,\nif you can. But I stay here and watch.... Have you read the Arabian\nNight in which a genii, as tall as a mountain, is imprisoned in a bottle\nsealed with the seal of Solomon?... The genii is here, in the depths of\nour soul, the soul into which you are afraid to look down. I and the men\nof my time spent our lives in struggling with him: we did not conquer\nhim: he conquered us. At present we are both recovering our breath, and,\nwith no rancor nor fear, we are looking at each other, satisfied with\nthe struggles in which we have been engaged, waiting for the agreed\narmistice to expire. You are profiting by the armistice to gather your\nstrength and cull the world's beauty. Be happy. Enjoy the lull. But\nremember that one day, you or your children, on your return from your\nconquests, will have to come back to the place where I stand and resume\nthe combat, with new forces, against the genii by whose side I watch and\nwait. And the combat will endure with intervals of armistice until one\nof the two (perhaps both) will be laid low. It is your duty to be\nstronger and happier than we!...--Meanwhile, indulge in your sport if\nyou like: stiffen your muscles and strengthen your heart: and do not be\nso foolish as to waste your impatient vigor upon silly trifles: you\nbelong to an age that, if you are patient, will find a use for it.\"\n",

                "Georges did not remember much of what Christophe said to him. He was\nopen-minded enough to grasp Christophe's ideas, but they escaped him at\nonce. He forgot everything before he reached the bottom of the stairs.\nBut all the same, he had a feeling of well-being, which endured when the\nmemory of the words that had produced it had long been wiped out. He had\na real veneration for Christophe. He believed in nothing that Christophe\nbelieved in (at heart he laughed at everything and had no belief). But\nhe would have broken the head of any man who took upon himself to speak\nill of his old friend.\n",
                "Fortunately, no one did speak ill of him in his presence, otherwise he\nwould have been kept busy.\n",

                "Christophe had accurately forecast the next change of the wind. The new\nideal of the new French music was very different from his own; but while\nthat was a reason the more for Christophe to sympathize with it, its\nexponents had no sympathy with him. His vogue with the public was not\nlikely to reconcile the most hungry for recognition of these young men\nto him; they were meagerly fed, and their teeth were long, and they bit.\nChristophe was not put out by their spite.\n",
                "\"How thoroughly they do it!\" he would say. \"These boys are cutting their\nteeth....\"\n",
                "He was inclined to prefer them to the other puppies who fawned on him\nbecause of his success--those people of whom D'Aubign\u00e9 writes, who\n\"_when a mastiff plunges his nose into a butter-pot, come and lick his\nwhiskers by way of congratulation._\"\n",
                "He had a piece accepted at the Op\u00e9ra. Almost at once it was put into\nrehearsal. Through a newspaper attack Christophe learned that a certain\nyoung composer's piece had been postponed for it. The writer of the\narticle waxed indignant over such abuse of power, and made Christophe\nresponsible for it.\n",
                "Christophe went to see the manager, and said:\n",
                "\"Why didn't you tell me? You must not do it. You must put on the opera\nyou accepted before mine.\"\n",
                "The manager protested, began to laugh, refused, covered Christophe's\ncharacter, work, genius, with flattery, and said that the other man's\nwork was beneath contempt, and assured him that it was worthless and\nwould not make a sou.\n",
                "\"Why did you accept it then?\"\n",
                "\"One can't always do as one likes. Every now and then one has to throw a\nsop to public opinion. Formerly these young men could shout as much as\nthey pleased. And no one listened to them. But now they are able to let\nloose on us the nationalist Press, which roars 'Treason' and calls you a\ndisloyal Frenchman because you happen to have the misfortune to be\nunable to go into ecstasies over the younger school. The younger school!\nLet's look at it!... Shall I tell you what I think of it? I'm sick of\nit! So is the public. They bore us with their _Oremus!_... There's\nno blood in their veins; they're like sacristans chanting Mass: their\nlove duets are like the _De Profundis_.... If I were fool enough to\nput on the pieces I am compelled to accept, I should ruin my theater. I\naccept them: that is all they can ask.--Let us talk of something\nserious. Your work means a full house....\"\n",
                "And he went on with his compliments.\n",
                "Christophe cut him short, and said angrily:\n",
                "\"I am not taken in. Now that I am old and have 'arrived,' you are using\nme to suppress the young men. When I was a young man you would have\nsuppressed me in just the same way. You must play this boy's piece, or I\nshall withdraw my own.\"\n",
                "The manager threw up his hands, and said:\n",
                "\"But don't you see that if we did what you want, it would look as if we\nwere giving in to these newspaper attacks?\"\n",
                "\"What do I care?\" said Christophe.\n",
                "\"As you please! You will be their first victim.\"\n",
                "They put the young musician's piece into rehearsal without interrupting\nthe preparation of Christophe's. One was in three acts, the other in\ntwo: it was arranged to include them both in one program. Christophe\nwent to see the young man, for he wanted to be the first to give him the\nnews. The musician was loud in his promises of eternal gratitude.\n",
                "Naturally Christophe could not make the manager not devote all his\nattention to his piece. The interpretation and the scenery of the other\nwere rather scamped. Christophe knew nothing about it. He asked to be\nallowed to be present at a few rehearsals of the young man's opera: he\nthought it very mediocre, as he had been told: he ventured to give a\nlittle advice which was ill-received: he gave it up then, and did not\ninterfere again. On the other hand, the manager had made the young man\nadmit the necessity for a little cutting to have his piece produced in\ntime. Though the sacrifice was easily consented to at first, it was not\nlong before the author regretted it.\n",
                "On the evening of the performance the beginner's piece had no success,\nand Christophe's caused a sensation. Some of the papers attacked\nChristophe: they spoke of a trick, a plot to suppress a great young\nFrench artist: they said that his work had been mutilated to please the\nGerman master, whom they represented to be basely jealous of the coming\nfame of all the new men. Christophe shrugged his shoulders and thought:\n",
                "\"He will reply.\"\n",
                "\"He\" did not reply. Christophe sent him one of the paragraphs with these\nwords:\n",
                "\"Have you read this?\"\n",
                "The other replied:\n",
                "\"How sorry I am! The writer of it has always been so well disposed\ntowards me! Really, I am very sorry. The best thing is to pay no\nattention to it.\"\n",
                "Christophe laughed and thought: \"He is right! The little sneak.\"\n",
                "And he decided to forget all about it.\n",
                "But chance would have it that Georges, who seldom read the papers, and\nthat hastily, except for the sporting articles, should light on the most\nviolent attacks on Christophe. He knew the writer. He went to the caf\u00e9\nwhere he knew he would meet him, found him, struck him, fought a duel\nwith him, and gave him a nasty scratch on the shoulder with his rapier.\nNext day, at breakfast, Christophe had a letter from a friend telling\nhim of the affair. He was overcome. He left his breakfast and hurried to\nsee Georges. Georges himself opened the door. Christophe rushed in like\na whirlwind, seized him by the arms, and shook him angrily, and began to\noverwhelm him with a storm of furious reproaches.\n",
                "\"You little wretch!\" he cried. \"You have fought a duel for me! Who gave\nyou leave! A boy, a fly-by-night, to meddle in my affairs! Do you think\nI can't look after myself? What good have you done? You have done this\nrascal the honor of fighting him. He asked no more. You have made him a\nhero. Idiot! And if it had chanced ... (I am sure you rushed at it like\na madman as usual) ... if you had been wounded, killed perhaps!... You\nwretch! I should never have forgiven you as long as you lived!...\"\n",
                "Georges laughed uproariously at this last threat, and was so overcome\nwith merriment, that he cried:\n",
                "\"My dear old friend, how funny you are! Ah! You're unique! Here are you\ninsulting me for having defended you! Next time I shall attack you.\nPerhaps you'll embrace me then.\"\n",
                "Christophe stopped and hugged Georges, and kissed him on both cheeks,\nand then once more he said:\n",
                "\"My boy!... Forgive me. I am an old idiot.... But my blood boiled when I\nheard the news. What made you think of fighting? You don't fight with\nsuch people. Promise me at once that you will never do it again.\"\n",
                "\"I'll promise nothing of the kind,\" said Georges. \"I shall do as I\nlike.\"\n",
                "\"I forbid it. Do you hear? If you do it again, I'll never see you again.\nI shall publicly disown you in the newspapers I shall....\"\n",
                "\"You will disinherit me, you mean.\"\n",
                "\"Come, Georges. Please. What's the good of it?\"\n",
                "\"My dear old friend, you are a thousand times a better man than I am,\nand you know infinitely more: but I know these people better than you\ndo. Make yourself easy. It will do some good. They will think a little\nnow before they let loose their poisonous insults upon you.\"\n",
                "\"But what can these idiots do to me? I laugh at anything they may say.\"\n",
                "\"But I don't. And you must mind your own business.\"\n",
                "Thereafter Christophe lived on tenterhooks lest some fresh article might\nrouse Georges's susceptibilities. It was quite comic to see him during\nthe next few days going to a caf\u00e9 and devouring the newspapers, which he\nnever read as a rule, ready to go to all lengths (even to trickery) if\nhe found an insulting article, to prevent it reaching Georges. After a\nweek he recovered his equanimity. The boy was right. His action had\ngiven the yelping curs food for a moment's reflection.--And, though\nChristophe went on grumbling at the young lunatic who had made him waste\neight working days, he said to himself that, after all, he had no right\nto lecture him. He remembered a certain day, not so very long ago, when\nhe himself had fought a duel for Olivier's sake. And he thought he heard\nOlivier's voice saying:\n",
                "\"Let be, Christophe. I am giving you back what you lent me!\"\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Though Christophe took the attacks on himself lightly, there was one\nother man who was very far from such disinterestedness. This was\nEmmanuel.\n",
                "The evolution of European thought was progressing swiftly. It was as\nthough it had been accelerated by mechanical inventions and the new\nmotors. The stock of prejudices and hopes which in old days were enough\nto feed humanity for twenty years was now exhausted in five years. The\ngenerations of the mind were galloping ahead, one behind the other,\noften one trampling the other down, with Time sounding the\ncharge.--Emmanuel had been left behind.\n",
                "The singer of French energy had never denied the idealism of his master,\nOlivier. Passionate as was his national feeling, he identified himself\nwith his worship of moral greatness. If in his poetry he loudly\nproclaimed the triumph of France, it was because in her, by an act of\nfaith, he adored the loftiest ideas of modern Europe, the Athena Nike,\nthe victorious Law which takes its revenge on Force.--And now Force had\nawakened in the very heart of Law, and it was springing up in all its\nsavage nakedness. The new generation, robust and disciplined, was\nlonging for combat, and, before its victory was won, had the attitude of\nmind of the conqueror. This generation was proud of its strength, its\nthews, its mighty chest, its vigorous senses so thirsting for delight,\nits wings like the wings of a bird of prey hovering over the plains,\nwaiting to swoop down and try its talons. The prowess of the race, the\nmad flights over the Alps and the sea, the new crusades, not much less\nmystic, not much less interested than those of Philip Augustus and\nVillehardouin, had turned the nation's head. The children of the nation\nwho had never seen war except in books had no difficulty in endowing it\nwith beauty. They became aggressive. Weary of peace and ideas, they\nhymned the anvil of battle, on which, with bloody fists, action would\none day new-forge the power of France. In reaction against the\ndisgusting abuse of systems of ideas, they raised contempt of the idea\nto the level of a profession of faith. Blusteringly they exalted narrow\ncommon sense, violent realism, immodest national egoism, trampling\nunderfoot the rights of others and other nations, when it served the\nturn of their country's greatness. They were xenophobes, anti-democrats,\nand--even the most skeptical of them--set up the return to Catholicism,\nin the practical necessity for \"digging channels for the absolute,\" and\nshutting up the infinite under the surveillance of order and authority.\nThey were not content to despise--they regarded the gentle dotards of\nthe preceding generation, the visionary idealists, the humanitarian\nthinkers of the preceding generation, as public malefactors. Emmanuel\nwas among them in the eyes of the young men. He suffered cruelly and was\nvery angry.\n",
                "The knowledge that Christophe was, like himself,--more than himself--the\nvictim of their injustice, made him sympathetic. His ungraciousness had\ndiscouraged Christophe's visits. He was too proud to show his regret by\nseeking him out. But he contrived to meet him, as if by chance, and\nforced Christophe to make the first advances. Thereafter his umbrageous\nsusceptibilities were at rest, and he did not conceal the pleasure he\nhad in Christophe's company. Thereafter they often met in each other's\nrooms.\n",
                "Emmanuel confided his bitterness to Christophe. He was exasperated by\ncertain criticisms, and, thinking that Christophe was not sufficiently\nmoved by them, he made him read some of the newspaper appreciations of\nhimself. Christophe was accused of not knowing the grammar of his work,\nof being ignorant of harmony, of having stolen from other musicians,\nand, generally, of dishonoring music. He was called: \"This old\ntoss-brain....\" They said: \"We have had enough of these convulsionaries.\nWe are order, reason, classic balance....\"\n",
                "Christophe was vastly entertained.\n",
                "\"It is the law,\" he said. \"The young bury the old.... In my day, it is\ntrue, we waited until a man was sixty before we called him an old man.\nThey are going faster, nowadays.... Wireless telegraphy, aeroplanes....\nA generation is more quickly exploded.... Poor devils! They won't last\nlong! Let them despise us and strut about in the sun!\"\n",
                "But Emmanuel had not his sanity. Though he was fearless in thought, he\nwas a prey to his diseased nerves; with his ardent soul in his rickety\nbody, he was driven on to the fight and was unfitted for it. The\nanimosity of certain opinions of his work drew blood.\n",
                "\"Ah!\" he would say. \"If the critics knew the harm they do artists by the\nunjust words they throw out so recklessly, they would be ashamed of\ntheir trade.\"\n",
                "\"But they do know, my friend. That is the justification of their\nexistence. Everybody must live.\"\n",
                "\"They are butchers. One is drenched with the blood of life, worn out by\nthe struggle we have to wage with art. Instead of holding out their\nhands to us, and compassionately telling us of our faults, and brotherly\nhelping us to mend them, they stand there with their hands in their\npockets and watch you dragging your burden up the slope, and say: 'You\ncan't do it!' And when you reach the top, some of them say: 'Yes, but\nthat is not the way to climb up.' While the others go on blandly saying:\n'You couldn't do it!...' You're lucky if they don't send great stones\nrolling down on you to send you flying!\"\n",
                "\"Bah! There are plenty of good men among them, and think of the good\nthey can do! There are bad men everywhere. They're not peculiar to\ncriticism. Do you know anything worse than an ungenerous, vain, and\nembittered artist, to whom the world is only loot, that he is furious\nbecause he cannot grab? You must don patience for your protection. There\nis no evil but it may be of good service. The worst of the critics is\nuseful to us; he is a trainer: he does not let us loiter by the way.\nWhenever we think we have reached the goal, the pack hound us on. Get\non! Onward! Upward! They are more likely to weary of running after me\nthan I am of marching ahead of them. Remember the Arabian proverb:\n_'It is no use flogging sterile trees. Only those are stoned whose\nfront is crowned with golden fruit....'_ Let us pity the artists who\nare spared. They will stay half-way, lazily sitting down. When they try\nto get up their legs will be so stiff that they will be unable to walk.\nLong live my friend the enemy! They do me more good in my life than the\nenemy, my friend!\"\n",
                "Emmanuel could not help smiling. Then he said:\n",
                "\"All the same, don't you think it hard for a veteran like you to be\ntaken to task by recruits who are just approaching their first battle?\"\n",
                "\"They amuse me,\" said Christophe. \"Such arrogance is the mark of young,\nhot blood tingling to be up and doing. I was like that once. They are\nlike the showers of March falling on the new-born soil.... Let them take\nus to task! They are right, after all. Old people must learn from the\nyoung! They have profited by us, and are ungrateful: that is in the\norder of things. But, being enriched by our efforts, they will go\nfarther than we, and will realize what we attempted. If we still have\nsome youth left, let us learn in our turn, and try to rejuvenate\nourselves. If we cannot, if we are too old, let us rejoice in them. It\nis fine to see the perpetual new-flowering of the human soul that\nseemed, exhausted, the vigorous optimism of these young men, their\ndelight in action and adventures, the races springing to new life for\nthe conquest of the world.\"\n",
                "\"What would they be without us? Their joy is the fruit of our tears.\nTheir proud force is the flower of the sufferings of a whole generation.\n_Sic vos non nobis_....\"\n",
                "\"The old saying is wrong. It is for ourselves that we worked, and our\nreward lies in the creation of a race of men who shall surpass us. We\namassed their treasury, we hoarded it in a wretched hovel open to all\nthe winds of Heaven: we had to strain every nerve to keep the doors\nclosed against death. Our arms carved out the triumphal way along which\nour sons shall march. Our sufferings have saved the future. We have\nborne the Ark to the threshold of the Promised Land.

                "\"Do you regret it?\"\n",
                "\"No. There is a sort of intoxication in the tragic grandeur of the\nsacrifice of a mighty epoch like ours to the epoch that it has brought\ninto being. The men of to-day would not be more capable of tasting the\nsovereign joy of renunciation.\"\n",

                "The soothing influence that Christophe exercised over Georges and\nEmmanuel had the source of its power in Grazia's love. It was through\nthis love that he felt himself so near to all young things, and had an\ninexhaustible fund of sympathy for every new form of life. Whatever the\nforces might be that rekindled the earth, he was always with them, even\nwhen they were against him: he had no fear for the immediate future of\nthe democracies, that future which caused such an outcry against the\negoism of a handful of privileged men: he did not cling desperately to\nthe paternosters of an old art: he felt quite sure that from the\nfabulous visions, the realized dreams of science and action, a new art,\nmore puissant than the old, would spring forth: he hailed the new dawn\nof the world, even though the beauty of the old world were to die with\nit.\n",
                "Grazia knew the good that her love did for Christophe: and this\nconsciousness of her power lifted her out of herself. Through her\nletters she exercised a controlling power over her friend. She was not\nso absurdly pretentious as to try to control his art: she had too much\ntact, and knew her limitations. But her true, pure voice was the\ndiapason to which he attuned his soul. Christophe had only to hear her\nvoice echoing his thought to think nothing that was not just, pure, and\nworthy of repetition. The sound of a beautiful instrument is to a\nmusician like a beautiful body in which his dream at once becomes\nincarnate. Mysterious is the fusion of two loving spirits: each takes\nthe best from the other, but only to give it back again enriched with\nlove. Grazia was not afraid to tell Christophe that she loved him.\nDistance gave her more freedom of speech, and also, the certain\nknowledge that she would never be his. Her love, the religious fervor of\nwhich was communicated to Christophe, was a fountain of force and peace\nto him.\n",
                "Grazia gave to others more of such force and peace than she had herself.\nHer health was shattered, her moral balance seriously affected. Her\nson's condition did not improve. For the last two years she had lived in\na perpetual state of anxiety, aggravated by Lionello's fatal skill in\nplaying on it. He had acquired a consummate mastery of the art of\nkeeping those who loved him on tenterhooks: his idle mind was most\nfertile in inventing ways of rousing interest in himself and tormenting\nothers: it had become a mania with him. And the tragedy of it was, that,\nwhile he aped the ravages of disease, the disease did make real inroads\nupon him, and death peeped forth. Then the expected happened: Grazia,\nhaving been tortured by her son for years with his imaginary illness,\nceased to believe in it when the illness really came. The heart has its\nlimitations. She had exhausted her store of pity over his lies. She\nthought Lionello was still a comedian when he spoke the truth. And when\nthe truth was revealed to her, the rest of her life was poisoned by\nremorse.\n",
                "Lionello's malice had not laid aside its weapons. Having no love for any\none in the world, he could not bear any of those near him to feel love\nfor any one else: jealousy was his only passion. It was not enough for\nhim to have separated his mother and Christophe: he tried to force her\nto break off the intimacy which subsisted between them. Already he had\nemployed his usual weapon--his illness--to make Grazia swear that she\nwould not marry again. He was not satisfied with her promise. He tried\nto force his mother to give up writing to Christophe. On this she\nrebelled; and, being delivered by such an attempted abuse of power, she\nspoke harshly and severely to Lionello about his habit of lying, and,\nlater on, regarded herself as a criminal for having done so: for her\nwords flung Lionello into a fit of fury which made him really ill. His\nillness grew worse as he saw that his mother did not believe in it.\nThen, in his fury, he longed to die so as to avenge himself. He never\nthought that his wish would be granted.\n",
                "When the doctor told Grazia that there was no hope for her son, she was\ndumfounded. But she had to disguise her despair in order to deceive the\nboy who had so often deceived her. He had a suspicion that this time it\nwas serious, but he refused to believe it; and his eyes watched his\nmother's eyes for the reproachful expression that had infuriated him\nwhen he was lying. There came a time when there was no room for doubt.\nThen it was terrible, both for him and his mother and sister: he did not\nwish to die....\n",
                "When at last Grazia saw him sinking to sleep, she gave no cry and made\nno moan: she astonished those about her by her silence: she had no\nstrength left for suffering: she had only one desire, to sleep also.\nHowever, she went about the business of her life with the same apparent\ncalm. After a few weeks her smile returned to her lips, but she was more\nsilent still. No one suspected her inward distress, Christophe least of\nall. She had only written to tell him the news, without a word of\nherself. She did not answer Christophe's anxiously affectionate letters.\nHe wanted to come to her: she begged him not to. At the end of two or\nthree months, she resumed her old grave, serene tone with him. She would\nhave thought it criminal to put upon him the burden of her weakness. She\nknew how the echo of all her feelings reverberated in him, and how great\nwas his need to lean on her. She did not impose upon herself the\nrestraint of sorrow. This discipline was her salvation. In her weariness\nof life only two things gave her life: Christophe's love, and the\nfatalism, which, in sorrow as in joy, lay at the heart of her Italian\nnature. There was nothing intellectual in her fatalism: it was the\nanimal instinct, which makes a hunted beast go on, with no consciousness\nof fatigue, in a staring wide-eyed dream, forgetting the stones of the\nroad, forgetting its own body, until it falls. Her fatalism sustained\nher body. Love sustained her heart. Now that her own life was worn out,\nshe lived in Christophe. And yet she was more scrupulous than ever never\nin her letters to tell him of the love she had for him: no doubt because\nher love was greater: but also because she was conscious of the\n_veto_ of the dead boy, who had made her affection a crime. Then\nshe would relapse into silence, and refrain from writing for a time.\n",
                "Christophe did not understand her silence. Sometimes in the composed and\ntranquil tone of one of her letters he would be conscious of an\nunexpected note that seemed to be quivering with passionate moaning.\nThat would prostrate him: but he dared not say anything: he hardly dared\nto notice it: he was like a man holding his breath, afraid to breathe,\nfor fear of destroying an illusion. He knew almost infallibly that in\nthe next letter such notes as these would be atoned for by a deliberate\ncoldness. Then, once more, tranquillity ... _Meeresstille_....\n",

                "Georges and Emmanuel met at Christophe's one afternoon. Both were\npreoccupied with their own troubles: Emmanuel with his literary\ndisappointments, and Georges with some athletic failure. Christophe\nlistened to them good-humoredly and teased them affectionately. There\nwas a ring at the door. Georges went to open it. A servant had come with\na letter from Colette. Christophe stood by the window to read it. His\nfriends went on with their discussion, and did not see Christophe, whose\nback was turned to them. He left the room without their noticing it. And\nwhen they realized that he had done so, they were not surprised. But as\ntime passed and he did not return, Georges went and knocked at the door\nof the next room. There was no reply. Georges did not persist, for he\nknew his old friend's queer ways. A few minutes later Christophe\nreturned without a word. He seemed very calm, very kind, very gentle. He\nbegged their pardon for leaving them, took up the conversation where he\nhad left it, and spoke kindly about their troubles, and said many\nhelpful things. The tone of his voice moved them, though they knew not\nwhy.\n",
                "They left him. Georges went straight to Colette's, and found her in\ntears. As soon as she saw him she came swiftly to him and asked:\n",
                "\"How did our poor friend take the blow? It is terrible.\"\n",
                "Georges did not understand. And Colette told him that she had just sent\nChristophe the news of Grazia's death.\n",
                "She was gone, without having had time to say farewell to anybody. For\nseveral months past the roots of her life had been almost torn out of\nthe earth: a puff of wind was enough to lay it low. On the evening\nbefore the relapse of influenza which carried her off she received a\nlong, kind letter from Christophe. It had filled her with tenderness,\nand she longed to bid him come to her: she felt that everything else,\neverything that kept them apart, was absurd and culpable. She was very\nweary, and put off writing to him until the next day. On the day after\nshe had to stay in bed. She began a letter which she did not finish: she\nhad an attack of giddiness, and her head swam: besides, she was\nreluctant to speak of her illness, and was afraid of troubling\nChristophe. He was busy at the time with rehearsals of a choral symphony\nset to a poem of Emmanuel's: the subject had roused them both to\nenthusiasm, for it was something symbolical of their own destiny: _The\nPromised Land_. Christophe had often mentioned it to Grazia. The\nfirst performance was to take place the following week.... She must not\nupset him. In her letter Grazia just spoke of a slight cold. Then that\nseemed too much to her. She tore up the letter, and had no strength left\nto begin another. She told herself that she would write in the evening.\nWhen the evening came it was too late--too late to bid him come, too\nlate even to write.... How swiftly everything passes! A few hours are\nenough to destroy the labor of ages.... Grazia hardly had time to give\nher daughter a ring she wore and beg her to send it to her friend. Till\nthen she had not been very intimate with Aurora. Now that her life was\nebbing away, she gazed passionately at the face of the girl: she clung\nto the hand that would pass on the pressure of her own, and, joyfully,\nshe thought:\n",

                "When he left Colette, on an impulse of sympathy Georges went back to\nChristophe's. For a long time, through Colette's indiscretions, he had\nknown the place that Grazia filled in his old friend's heart: he had\neven--(for youth is not respectful)--made fun of it. But now generously\nand keenly he felt the sorrow that Christophe must be feeling at such a\nloss; and he felt that he must go to him, embrace him, pity him. Knowing\nthe violence of his passions,--the tranquillity that Christophe had\nshown made him anxious. He rang the bell. No answer. He rang once more\nand knocked, giving the signal agreed between Christophe and himself. He\nheard the moving of a chair and a slow, heavy tread. Christophe opened\nthe door. His face was so calm that Georges stopped still, just as he\nwas about to fling himself into his arms: he knew not what to say.\nChristophe asked him gently:\n",
                "\"You, my boy. Have you forgotten something?\"\n",
                "Georges muttered uneasily:\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "\"Come in.\"\n",
                "Christophe went and sat in the chair he had left on Georges's arrival,\nnear the window, with his head thrown back, looking at the roofs\nopposite and the reddening evening sky. He paid no attention to Georges.\nThe young man pretended to look about on the table, while he stole\nglances at Christophe. His face was set: the beams of the setting sun\nlit up his cheek-bones and his forehead. Mechanically Georges went into\nthe next room--the bedroom--as though he were still looking for\nsomething. It was in this room that Christophe had shut himself up with\nthe letter. It was still there on the bed, which bore the imprint of a\nbody. On the floor lay a book that had slipped down. It had been left\nopen with a page crumpled. Georges picked it up, and read the story of\nthe meeting of the Magdalene and the Gardener in the Gospel.\n",
                "He came back into the living-room, and moved a few things here and there\nto gain countenance, and once more he looked at Christophe, who had not\nbudged. He longed to tell him how he pitied him. But Christophe was so\nradiant with light that Georges felt that it was out of place to speak.\nIt was rather himself who stood in need of consolation. He said timidly:\n",
                "\"I am going.\"\n",
                "Without turning his head, Christophe said:\n",
                "\"Good-by, my boy.\"\n",
                "Georges went away and closed the door without a sound.\n",
                "For a long time Christophe sat there. Night came. He was not suffering:\nhe was not thinking: he saw no definite image. He was like a tired man\nlistening to some vague music without making any attempt to understand\nit. The night was far gone when he got up, cramped and stiff. He flung\nhimself on his bed and slept heavily. The symphony went on buzzing all\naround him....\n",
                "And now he saw _her_, the well-beloved.... She held out her hands\nto him, and said, smiling:\n",
                "\"Now you have passed through the zone of fire.\"\n",
                "Then his heart melted. An indescribable peace filled the starry spaces,\nwhere the music of the spheres flung out its great, still, profound\nsheets of water....\n",
                "When he awoke (it was day), his strange happiness still endured, with\nthe distant gleam of words falling upon his ears. He got up. He was\nexalted with a silent, holy enthusiasm.\n",

                "Between Beatrice and himself, the wall was broken down. For a long time\nnow more than half his soul had dwelt upon the other side.

With every new blow\nthat we have to bear, with every new work that we round and finish, we\nescape from ourselves, we escape into the work we have created, the soul\nwe have loved, the soul that has left us. When all is told, Rome is not\nin Rome: the best of a man lies outside himself. Only Grazia had\nwithheld him on this side of the wall. And now in her turn.... Now the\ndoor was shut upon the world of sorrow.\n",
                "He lived through a period of secret exaltation. He felt the weight of no\nfetters. He expected nothing of the things of this world. He was\ndependent upon nothing. He was set free. The struggle was at an end.\nIssuing from the zone of combat and the circle where reigned the God of\nheroic conflict, _Dominus Deus Sabaoth_, he looked down, and in the\nnight saw the torch of the Burning Bush put out. How far away it was!\nWhen it had lit up his path he had thought himself almost at the summit.\nAnd since then, how far he had had to go! And yet the topmost pinnacle\nseemed no nearer. He would never reach it (he saw that now), though he\nwere to march on to eternity. But when a man enters the circle of light\nand knows that he has not left those he loves behind him, eternity is\nnot too long a space to be journeying on with them.\n",
                "He closed his doors. No one knocked. Georges had expended all his\ncompassion and sympathy in the one impulse; he was reassured by the time\nhe reached home, and forgot all about it by the next day. Colette had\ngone to Rome. Emmanuel knew nothing, and hypersensitive as usual, he\nmaintained an affronted silence because Christophe had not returned his\nvisit. Christophe was not disturbed in his long colloquy with the woman\nwhom he now bore in his soul, as a pregnant woman bears her precious\nburden. It was a moving intercourse, impossible to translate into words.\nEven music could hardly express it. When his heart was full, almost\noverflowing, Christophe would lie still with eyes closed, and listen to\nits song. Or, for hours together, he would sit at his piano and let his\nfingers speak. During this period he improvised more than he had done in\nthe whole of his life. He did not set down his thoughts. What was the\ngood?\n",
                "When, after several weeks, he took to going out again and seeing other\nmen, while none of his friends, except Georges, had any suspicion of\nwhat had happened, the daimon of improvisation pursued him still. It\nwould take possession of Christophe just when he was least expecting it.\nOne evening, at Colette's, Christophe sat down at the piano and played\nfor nearly an hour, absolutely surrendering himself, and forgetting that\nthe room was full of strangers. They had no desire to laugh. His\nterrible improvisations enslaved and overwhelmed them. Even those who\ndid not understand their meaning were thrilled and moved: and tears came\nto Colette's eyes.... When Christophe had finished he turned away\nabruptly: he saw how everybody was moved, and shrugged his shoulders,\nand--laughed.\n",
                "He had reached the point at which sorrow also becomes a force--a\ndominant force. His sorrow possessed him no more: he possessed his\nsorrow: in vain it fluttered and beat upon its bars: he kept it caged.\n",
                "From that period date his most poignant and his happiest works: a scene\nfrom the Gospel which Georges recognized--\n",
                "\"_Mulier, quid ploras?\"--\"Quia tulerunt Dominium meum, et nescio ubi\nposuerunt eum.\"\n",
                "Et cum haec dixisset, conversa est retrorsum, et vidit Jesum stantem: et\nnon sciebat quia Jesus est_.\n",
                "--a series of tragic _lieder_ set to verses of popular Spanish\n_cantares_, among others a gloomy sad love-song, like a black\nflame--\n",
                "  \"_Quisiera ser el sepulcro\n  Donde \u00e1 ti te han de enterrar,\n  Para tenerte en mis brazos\n  Por toda la eternidad_.\"\n(\"Would I were the grave, where thou art to be buried, that I might hold\nthee in my arms through all eternity.\")\n",
                "--and two symphonies, called _The Island of Tranquillity_ and\n_The Dream of Scipio_, in which, more intimately than in any other\nof the works of Jean-Christophe Krafft, is realized the union of the\nmost beautiful of the forces of the music of his time: the affectionate\nand wise thought of Germany with all its shadowy windings, the clear\npassionate melody of Italy, and the quick mind of France, rich in subtle\nrhythms and variegated harmonies.\n",
                "This \"enthusiasm begotten of despair at the time of a great loss\" lasted\nfor a few months. Thereafter Christophe fell back into his place in life\nwith a stout heart and a sure foot. The wind of death had blown away the\nlast mists of pessimism, the gray of the Stoic soul, and the\nphantasmagoria of the mystic chiaroscura. The rainbow had shone upon the\nvanishing clouds. The gaze of heaven, purer, as though it had been laved\nwith tears, smiled through them. There was the peace of evening on the\nmountains.\n"

                "The fire smoldering in the forest of Europe was beginning to burst into\nflames. In vain did they try to put it out in one place: it only broke\nout in another: with gusts of smoke and a shower of sparks it swept from\none point to another, burning the dry brushwood. Already in the East\nthere were skirmishes as the prelude to the great war of the nations.\nAll Europe, Europe that only yesterday was skeptical and apathetic, like\na dead wood, was swept by the flames. All men were possessed by the\ndesire for battle. War was ever on the point of breaking out. It was\nstamped out, but it sprang to life again. The world felt that it was the\nmercy of an accident that might let loose the dogs of war. The world lay\nin wait. The feeling of inevitability weighed heavily even upon the most\npacifically minded. And ideologues, sheltered beneath the massive shadow\nof the cyclops, Proudhon, hymned in war man's fairest title of\nnobility....\n",
                "This, then, was to be the end of the physical and moral resurrection of\nthe races of the West! To such butchery they were to be borne along by\nthe currents of action and passionate faith! Only a Napoleonic genius\ncould have marked out a chosen, deliberate aim for this blind, onward\nrush. But nowhere in Europe was there any genius for action. It was as\nthough the world had chosen the most mediocre to be its governors. The\nforce of the human mind was in other things.--So there was nothing to be\ndone but to trust to the declivity down which they were moving. This\nboth governors and governed were doing. Europe looked like a vast armed\nvigil.\n",
                "Christophe remembered a similar vigil, when he had had Olivier's anxious\nface by his side. But then the menace of war had been only a passing\ncloud. Now all Europe lay under its shadow. And Christophe's heart also\nhad changed. He could not share in the hatred of the nations. His state\nof mind was like that of Goethe in 1813. How could a man fight without\nhatred? And how could he hate without youth? He had passed through the\nzone of hatred. Which of the great rival nations was the dearest to him?\nHe had learned to know all their merits, and what the world owed to\nthem. When a man has reached a certain stage in the development of the\nsoul _\"he knows no nation, he feels the happiness or unhappiness of\nthe neighboring peoples as his own.\"_ The storm-clouds are at his\nfeet. Around him is nothing but the sky--_\"the whole Heavens, the\nkingdom of the eagle.\"_\n",
                "And yet Christophe was sometimes embarrassed by this ambient hostility.\nIn Paris he was made to feel too clearly that he was of the hostile\nrace: even his friend Georges could not resist the pleasure of giving\nvent, in his presence, to feelings about Germany which made him sad.\nThen he rushed away, on the excuse that he wanted to see Grazia's\ndaughter: and he went and stayed for a time in Rome. But there the\natmosphere was no more serene. The great plague of national pride had\nspread there, and had transformed the Italian character. The Italians,\nwhom Christophe had known to be indifferent and indolent, were now\nthinking of nothing but military glory, battle, conquests, Roman eagles\nflying over the sands of Libya: they believed they had returned to the\ntime of the Emperors. The wonderful thing was that this madness was\nshared, with the best faith in the world, by the opposition parties,\nsocialists and clericals, as well as by the monarchists, and they had\nnot the least idea that they were being unfaithful to their cause. So\nlittle do politics and human reason count when the great epidemic\npassions sweep over the nations. Such passions do not even trouble to\nsuppress individual passions; they use them; and everything converges on\nthe one goal. In the great periods of action it was ever thus. The\narmies of Henri IV., the Councils of Louis XIV., which forged the\ngreatness of France, numbered as many men of faith and reason as men of\nvanity, interest, and enjoyment. Jansenists and libertines, Puritans and\ngallants, served the same destiny in serving their instincts. In the\nforthcoming wars no doubt internationalists and pacificists will kindle\nthe blaze, in the conviction, like that of their ancestors of the\nConvention, that they are doing it for the good of the nations and the\ntriumph of peace.\n",
                "With a somewhat ironical smile, Christophe, from the terrace of the\nJaniculum, looked down on the disparate and harmonious city, the symbol\nof the universe which it dominated; crumbling ruins, \"baroque\" fa\u00e7ades,\nmodern buildings, cypress and roses intertwined--every age, every style,\nmerged into a powerful and coherent unity beneath the clear light. So\nthe mind should shed over the struggling universe the order and light\nthat are in it.\n",
                "Christophe did not stay long in Rome. The impression made on him by the\ncity was too strong: he was afraid of it. Truly to profit by its harmony\nhe needed to hear it at a distance: he felt that if he stayed he would\nbe in danger of being absorbed by it, like so many other men of his\nrace.--Every now and then he went and stayed in Germany. But, when all\nwas told, and in spite of the imminence of a Franco-German war, Paris\nstill had the greatest attraction for him. No doubt this was because his\nadopted son, Georges, lived there. But he was not only swayed by reasons\nof affection. There were other reasons of an intellectual order that\nwere no less powerful. For an artist accustomed to the full life of the\nmind, who generously shares in all the sufferings, all the hopes, and\nall the passions of the great human family, it was difficult to grow\naccustomed to life in Germany. There was no lack of artists there. But\nthe artists lacked air. They were isolated from the rest of the nation,\nwhich took no interest in them: other preoccupations, social or\npractical, absorbed the attention of the public. The poets shut\nthemselves up in disdainful irritation in their disdained art; it became\na point of honor with them to sever the last ties which bound them to\nthe life of the people: they wrote only for a few, a little aristocracy\nfull of talent, refined and sterile, being itself divided into rival\ngroups of jaded initiates, and they were stifled in the narrow room in\nwhich they were huddled together: they were incapable of expanding it,\nand set themselves to dig down; they turned the soil over until it was\nexhausted. Then they drifted away into their archaic dreams, and never\neven troubled to bring their dreams into the common stock. Each man\nfought for his place in the mist. They had no light in common. Each man\nhad to look for light within himself.\n",
                "Yonder, on the other hand, on the other side of the Rhine, among their\nneighbors on the West, the great winds of collective passion, of public\nturbulence and tribulation, swept periodically over art. And, high above\nthe plain, like their Eiffel Tower above Paris, shone afar off the\nnever-dying light of a classic tradition, handed down from generation to\ngeneration, which, while it never enslaved nor constrained the mind,\nshowed it the road followed by past ages, and established the communion\nof a whole nation in its light. Many a German spirit--like birds strayed\nin the night--came winging towards the distant beacon. But who is there\nin France can dream of the power of the sympathy which drives so many\ngenerous hearts from the neighboring nation towards France! So many\nhands stretched out: hands that are not responsible for the aims of the\npoliticians!... And you see no more of us, our brothers in Germany,\nthough we say to you: \"Here are our hands. In spite of lies and hatred,\nwe will not be parted. We have need of you, you have need of us, to\nbuild the greatness of our spirits and our people. We are the two wings\nof the West. If one be broken, there is an end of flight! Let the war\ncome! It will not break the clasp of our hands or the flight of our\ngenius in brotherhood.\"\n",
                "So thought Christophe. He felt the mutual completion which the two races\ncould give each other, and how lame and halting were the spirit, the\nart, the action of each without the help of the other. For his own part,\nborn in the Rhine-lands where the two civilizations mingle in one\nstream, from his childhood he had instinctively felt their inevitable\nunion; all through his life the unconscious effort of his genius had\nbeen to maintain the balance and equilibrium of the two mighty wings.\nThe greater was his wealth of Germanic dreams, the more he needed the\nLatin clarity of mind and order. It was for this reason that France was\nso dear to him. In France he had the joy of better knowledge and mastery\nof himself. Only in France was he wholly himself.\n",
                "He turned to account all the elements that were or might be noxious to\nhim. He assimilated foreign energy in his own. A vigorous healthy mind\nabsorbs every kind of force, even that which is hostile to it, and makes\nit bone and flesh of its bone and flesh. There even comes a time when a\nman is most attracted by what least resembles him, for therein he finds\nhis most plentiful nourishment.\n",
                "Christophe did in fact find more pleasure in the work of artists who\nwere set up as his rivals than in the work of his imitators:--for he had\nimitators who called themselves his disciples, to his great despair.\nThey were honest, laborious, estimable, and altogether virtuous people\nwho were full of respect and veneration for him. Christophe would have\ngiven much if he could have liked their music; but--(it was just his\nluck!)--he could not do it: he found it meaningless. He was a thousand\ntimes more pleased with the talent of musicians who were personally\nantipathetic to him, and in art represented tendencies hostile to his\nown.... Well! What did it matter? These men were at least alive! Life\nis, in itself, such a virtue, that, if a man be deprived of it, though\nhe possess all the other virtues, he will never be a really good man,\nfor he cannot really be a man. Christophe used jokingly to say that the\nonly disciples he recognized were the men who attacked him. And when a\nyoung artist came and talked to him about his musical vocation, and\ntried to win his sympathy by flattering him, Christophe would say:\n",
                "\"So. My music satisfies you? That is how you would express your love, or\nyour hatred?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, master.\"\n",
                "\"Well. Don't. You have nothing to say.\"\n",
                "His horror of the submissive temper of mind, of men born to obey, his\nneed of absorbing other ideas than his own, attracted him to circles\nwhose ideas were diametrically opposed to his own. He had friends among\nmen to whom his art, his idealistic faith, his moral conceptions, were a\ndead letter: they had absolutely different ways of envisaging life,\nlove, marriage, the family, every social relationship:--but they were\ngood fellows, though they seemed to belong to another stage of moral\nevolution: the anguish and the scruples that had consumed a part of\nChristophe's life were incomprehensible to them. No doubt that was all\nthe better for them! Christophe had no desire to make them understand.\nHe did not ask others to confirm his ideas by thinking as he did: he was\nsure of his own thoughts. He asked them to let him know their thoughts,\nand to love their souls. He asked always to know and to love more, to\nsee and to learn how to see. He had reached the point not only of\nadmitting in others tendencies of mind that he had once combated, but\nalso of rejoicing in them, for they seemed to him to contribute to\nthe fecundity of the universe. He loved Georges the more because he did not\ntake life tragically, as he did. Humanity would be too poor and too gray\nin color if it were to be uniformly clad in the moral seriousness, and\nthe heroic restraint with which Christophe was armed. Humanity needed\njoy, carelessness, irreverent audacity in face of its idols, all its\nidols, even the most holy. Long live \"the Gallic salt which revives the\nworld\"! Skepticism and faith are no less necessary. Skepticism, riddling\nthe faith of yesterday, prepares the way for the faith of to-morrow....\nHow clear everything becomes to the man who stands away from life, and,\nas in a fine picture, sees the contrasting colors merge into a magical\nharmony, where, when they were closely seen, they clashed.\n",
                "Christophe's eyes had been opened to the infinite variety of the\nmaterial, as of the moral, world. It had been one of his greatest\nconquests since his first visit to Italy. In Paris he especially sought\nthe company of painters and sculptors; it seemed to him that the best of\nthe French genius was in them. The triumphant audacity with which they\npursued and captured movement, vibrant color, and tore away the veils\nthat cover life, made his heart leap with delight. The inexhaustible\nriches that he who has eyes to see can find in a drop of light, a second\nof life! Against such sovereign delights of the mind what matters the\nvain tumult of dispute and war?... But dispute and war also are a part\nof the marvelous spectacle. We must embrace everything, and, valiantly,\njoyously, fling into the crucible of our burning hearts both the forces\nof denial and the forces of affirmation, enemies and friends, the whole\nmetal of life. The end of it all is the statue which takes shape in us,\nthe divine fruit of our minds; and all is good that helps to make it\nmore beautiful even at the cost of the sacrifice of ourselves. What does\nthe creator matter? Only that which is created is real.... You cannot\nhurt us, ye enemies who seek to reach us with your hostility. We are\nbeyond the reach of your attacks.... You are rending the empty cloak. I\nhave been gone this many a day.\n",
                "His music had found a more serene form. No longer did it show the storms\nof spring, which gathered, burst, and disappeared in the old days, but,\ninstead, the white clouds of summer, mountains of snow and gold, great\nbirds of light, slowly soaring, and filling the sky.... Creation.\nRipening crops in the calm August sunlight....\n",
                "At first a vague, mighty torpor, the obscure joy of the full grape, the\nswollen ear of corn, the pregnant woman brooding over her ripe fruit. A\nbuzzing like the sound of an organ; the hive all alive with the hum of\nthe bees.... Such somber, golden music, like an autumn honeycomb, slowly\ngives forth the rhythm which shall mark its path: the round of the\nplanets is made plain: it begins to spin....\n",
                "Then the will appears. It leaps onto the back of the whinnying dream as\nit passes, and grips it with its knees. The mind recognizes the laws of\nthe rhythm which guides it: it tames the disordered forces and fixes the\npath they shall take, the goal towards which they shall move. The\nsymphony of reason and instinct is organized. The darkness grows bright.\nOn the long ribbon of the winding road, at intervals, there are\nbrilliant fires, which in their turn shall be in the work of creation\nthe nucleus of little planetary worlds linked up in the girdle of their\nsolar system....\n",
                "The main lines of the picture are henceforth fixed. Now it looms through\nthe uncertain light of dawn. Everything is becoming definite: the\nharmony of the colors, the outline of the figures. To bring the work to\nits close all the resources of his being are brought into requisition.\nThe scent-box of memory is opened and exhales its perfumes. The mind\nunchains the senses: it lets them wax delirious and is silent: but,\ncrouching there, it watches them and chooses its prey....\n",
                "All is ready: the team of workmen carries out, with the materials\nsnatched from the senses, the work planned by the mind. A great\narchitect must have good journeymen who know their trade and will not\nspare themselves.--The cathedral is finished.\n",
                "\"And God looked down on his work. And He saw that _it was not yet\ngood._\"\n",
                "The Master's eyes take in the whole of His creation, and His hand\nperfects its harmony....\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "The dream is ended. _Te Deum_....\n",
                "The white clouds of summer, like great birds of light, slowly soar and\nhover; and the heavens are filled with their widespread wings.\n",
                "And yet his life was very far from being one with his art. A man of his\nkind cannot do without love, not merely that equable love which the\nspirit of an artist sheds on all things in the world, but a love that\nknows _preference_: he must always be giving himself to the\ncreatures of his choice. They are the roots of the tree. Through them\nhis heart's blood is renewed.\n",
                "Christophe's heart's blood was nothing like dried up. He was steeped in\na love which was the best part of his joy, a twofold love, for Grazia's\ndaughter and Olivier's son. He united them in thought, and was to unite\nthem in reality.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "Georges and Aurora had met at Colette's: Aurora lived in her cousin's\nhouse. She spent part of the year in Rome and the rest in Paris. She\nwas eighteen: Georges five years older. She was tall, erect, elegant,\nwith a small head, and an open countenance, fair hair, a dark\ncomplexion, a slight down on her lips, bright eyes with a laughing\nexpression behind which lay busy thoughts, a rather plump chin, brown\nhands, beautiful round strong arms, and a fine bust; and she always\nlooked gay, proud, and worldly. She was not at all intellectual, hardly\nat all sentimental, and she had inherited her mother's careless\nindolence. She would sleep eleven hours on end. The rest of the time she\nspent in lounging and laughing, only half awake. Christophe called her\n_Dornr\u00f6schen_--the Sleeping Beauty. She reminded him of his old\nlove, Sabine. She used to sing as she went to bed, and when she got up,\nand laugh for no reason at all, with merry childish laughter, and then\ngulp it down with a sort of hiccough. It were impossible to tell how she\nspent the time. All Colette's efforts to equip her with the brilliant\nartificiality which is so easily imposed on the mind of a young girl,\nlike a kind of lacquered varnish, had been wasted: the varnish would not\nhold. She learned nothing: she would take months to read a book, and\nwould like it immensely, though in a week she would forget both its\ntitle and its subject: without the least embarrassment she would make\nmistakes in spelling, and when she spoke of learned matters she would\nfall into the most comical blunders. She was refreshing in her youth,\nher gaiety, her lack of intellectuality, even in her faults, her\nthoughtlessness which sometimes amounted to indifference, and her na\u00efve\negoism. She was always so spontaneous. Young as she was, and simple and\nindolent, she could when she pleased play the coquette, though in all\ninnocence: then she would spread her net for young men and go sketching,\nor play the nocturnes of Chopin, or carry books of poetry which she had\nnot read, and indulge in conversations and hats that were about equally\nidealistic.\n",
                "Christophe would watch her and laugh gently to himself. He had a\nfatherly tenderness, indulgent and teasing, for Aurora. And he had also\na secret feeling of worship for the woman he had loved who had come\nagain with new youth for another love than his. No one knew the depth of\nhis affection. Only Aurora ever suspected it. From her childhood she had\nalmost always been used to having Christophe near her, and she used to\nregard him as one of her family. In her old sorrow at being less loved\nthan her brother she had instinctively drawn near to Christophe. She\ndivined that he had a similar sorrow; he saw her grief: and though they\nnever exchanged confidences, they shared each other's feelings. Later,\nwhen she discovered the feeling that united her mother and Christophe,\nit seemed to her that she was in the secret, though they had never told\nher. She knew the meaning of the message with which Grazia had charged\nher as she lay dying, and of the ring which was now on Christophe's\nhand. So there existed hidden ties between her and Christophe, ties\nwhich she did not need to understand, to feel them in their complexity.\nShe was sincerely attached to her old friend, although she could never\nhave made the effort necessary to play or to read his work. Though she\nwas a fairly good musician, she had never even had the curiosity to cut\nthe pages of a score he had dedicated to her. She loved to come and have\nan intimate talk with him.--She came more often when she found out that\nshe might meet Georges Jeannin in his rooms.\n",
                "And Georges, too, found an extraordinary interest in Christophe's\ncompany.\n",
                "However, the two young people were slow to realize their real feelings.\nThey had at first looked at each other mockingly. They were hardly at\nall alike. He was quicksilver, she was still water. But it was not long\nbefore quicksilver tried to appear more at rest, and sleeping water\nawoke. Georges would criticise Aurora's clothes, and her Italian\ntaste--a slight want of feeling for modulation and a certain preference\nfor crude colors. Aurora used to delight in teasing Georges, and\nimitating his rather hurried and precious way of speaking. And while\nthey laughed at each other, they both took pleasure ... in laughing, or\nin entertaining each other? They used to entertain Christophe too, and,\nfar from gainsaying them, he would maliciously transpose these little\npoisoned darts from one to the other. They pretended not to care: but\nthey soon discovered that they cared only too much; and both, especially\nGeorges, being incapable of concealing their annoyance, as soon as they\nmet they would begin sparring. Their wounds were slight: they were\nafraid of hurting each other: and the hand which dealt the blow was so\ndear to the recipient of it that they both found more pleasure in the\nhurts they received than in those they gave. They used to watch each\nother curiously, and their eyes, seeking defects, would find only\nattractions. But they would not admit it. Each, to Christophe, would\ndeclare that the other was unbearable, but, for all that, they were not\nslow to seize every opportunity of meeting that Christophe gave them.\n",
                "One day when Aurora was with her old friend to tell him that she would\ncome and see him on the following Sunday in the morning, Georges rushed\nin, like a whirlwind as usual, to tell Christophe that he was coming on\nSunday afternoon. On Sunday morning Christophe waited in vain for\nAurora. At the hour mentioned by Georges she appeared, and asked him to\nforgive her because it had been impossible for her to come in the\nmorning: she embroidered her excuses with a circumstantial story.\nChristophe was amused by her innocent roguery, and said:\n",
                "\"It is a pity. You would have seen Georges: he came and lunched with me;\nbut he would not stay this afternoon.\"\n",
                "Aurora was discomfited, and did not listen to anything Christophe said.\nHe went on talking good-humoredly. She replied absently, and was not far\nfrom being cross with him. Came a ring at the bell. It was Georges.\nAurora was amazed. Christophe looked at her and laughed. She saw that he\nhad been making fun of her, and laughed and blushed. He shook his finger\nat her waggishly. Suddenly she ran and kissed him warmly. He whispered\nto her:\n",
                "_\"Biricchina, ladroncella, furbetta....\"_\n",
                "And she laid her hand on his lips to silence him.\n",
                "Georges could make nothing of their kissing and laughter. His expression\nof astonishment, almost of vexation, added to their joy.\n",
                "So Christophe labored to bring the two young people together. And when\nhe had succeeded he was almost sorry. He loved them equally; but he\njudged Georges more hardly: he knew his weakness: he idolized Aurora,\nand thought himself responsible for her happiness even more than for\nGeorges's; for it seemed to him that Georges was as a son to him, a part\nof himself, and he wondered whether it was not wrong to give Aurora in\nher innocence a companion who was very far from sharing it.\n",
                "But one day as he passed by an arbor where the two young people were\nsitting--(a short time after their betrothal)--his heart sank as he\nheard Aurora laughingly questioning Georges about one of his past\nadventures, and Georges telling her, nothing loth. Other scraps of\nconversation, which they made no attempt to disguise, showed him that\nAurora was far more at home than himself with Georges's moral ideas.\nThough they were very much in love with each other it was clear that\nthey did not regard themselves as bound forever; into their discussions\nof questions relating to love and marriage, they brought a spirit of\nliberty, which might have a beauty of its own, though it was singularly\nat variance with the old ideal of mutual devotion _usque ad mortem._ And\nChristophe would look at them a little sadly.... How far they were from\nhim already! How swiftly does the ship that bears our children speed\non!... Patience! A day will come when we shall all meet in harbor.\n",
                "Meanwhile the ship paid no heed to the way marked out for it: it trimmed\nits sails to every wind.--It would have seemed natural for the spirit of\nliberty, which was then tending to modify morality, to take up its stand\nalso in the other domains of thought and action. But it did nothing of\nthe kind: human nature cares little for contradiction. While morality\nwas becoming more free, the mind was becoming less so; it was demanding\nthat religion should restore its yoke. And this twofold movement in\nopposite directions was, with a magnificent defiance of logic, taking\nplace in the same souls. Georges and Aurora had been caught up by the\nnew current of Catholicism which was conquering many people of fashion\nand many intellectuals. Nothing could be more curious than the way in\nwhich Georges, who was naturally critical and perfectly irreligious,\nskepticism being to him as easy as breathing, Georges, who had never\ncared for God or devil--a true Frenchman, laughing at\neverything--suddenly declared that there lay the truth. He needed truth\nof some sort, and this sorted well with his need of action, his\natavistic French bourgeois characteristics, and his weariness of\nliberty. The young fool had wandered long enough, and he returned of his\nown accord to be harnessed to the plow of his race. The example of a\nnumber of his friends was enough for him. Georges was hypersensitive to\nthe least atmospheric pressure of the ideas that surrounded him, and he\nwas one of the first to be caught. And Aurora followed him, as she would\nhave followed him anywhere. At once they felt sure of themselves, and\ndespised everybody who did not think as they did. The irony of it! These\ntwo frivolous children were sincerely devout, while the moral purity,\nthe serious and ardent efforts of Grazia and Olivier had never helped\nthem to be so, in spite of their desire.\n",
                "Christophe watched their spiritual evolution with sympathetic curiosity.\nHe did not try to fight against it, as Emmanuel would have done, for\nEmmanuel's free idealism was up in arms against this return of the\nancient foe. It is vain to fight against the passing wind. One can only\nwait for it to go. The reason of humanity was exhausted. It had just\nmade a gigantic effort. It was overcome with sleep, and, like a child\nworn out by a long day, before going to sleep, it was saying its\nprayers. The gate of dreams had reopened; in the train of religion came\nlittle puffs of theosophy, mysticism, esoteric faiths, occultism to\nvisit the chambers of the Western mind. Even philosophy was wavering.\nTheir gods of thought, Bergson and William James, were tottering. Even\nscience was attainted, even science was showing the signs of the fatigue\nof reason. We have a moment's respite. Let us breathe. To-morrow the\nmind will awake again, more alert, more free.... Sleep is good when a\nman has worked hard. Christophe, who had had little time for it, was\nhappy that these children of his should enjoy it in his stead, and\nshould have rest for the soul, security of faith, absolute, unshakable\nconfidence in their dreams. He would not nor could he have exchanged his\nlot for theirs. But he thought that Grazia's melancholy and Olivier's\ndistress of mind had found solace in their children, and that it was\nwell.\n",
                "\"All that we have suffered, I, my friends, and so many others whom I\nnever knew, others who lived before us, all has been, that these two\nmight attain joy.... The joy, Antoinette, for which thou wast made, the\njoy that was refused thee!... Ah! If only the unhappy could have a\nforetaste of the happiness that will one day spring forth from the\nsacrifice of their lives!\"\n",
                "What purpose could be served by his trying to dispute their happiness?\nWe must not try to make others happy in our way, but in their own. At\nmost he only asked Georges and Aurora not to be too contemptuous of\nthose who, like himself, did not share their faith.\n",
                "They did not even take the trouble to argue with him. They seemed to say\nto each other:\n",
                "\"He cannot understand....\"\n",
                "In their eyes he belonged to the past. And, to be frank, they did not\nattach much importance to the past. When they were alone they used often\nto talk innocently of the things they would do when Christophe \"was no\nlonger with them.\"...--However, they loved him well.... How terrible\nare the children who grow up over us like creepers! How terrible is the\nforce of Nature, hurrying, hurrying, driving us out....\n",
                "\"Go! Go! Remove thyself! It is my turn now!...\"\n",
                "Christophe, overhearing their thoughts, longed to say to them:\n",
                "\"Don't be in such a hurry! I am quite happy here. Please regard me still\nas a living being.\"\n",
                "He was amused by their naive impertinence.\n",
                "\"You may as well say straight out,\" he observed one day when they had\ncrushed him with their disdainful manner. \"You may as well say that I am\na stupid old man.\"\n",
                "\"No, no, my dear old friend,\" said Aurora, laughing heartily. \"You are\nthe best of men, but there are some things that you do not know.\"\n",
                "\"And that you do know, my girl? You are very wise!\"\n",
                "\"Don't laugh at me. I know nothing much. But Georges knows.\"\n",
                "Christophe smiled:\n",
                "\"Yes. You are right, my dear. The man you love always knows.\"\n",
                "It was much more difficult for him to tolerate their music than to put\nup with their intellectual superiority. They used to try his patience\nseverely. The piano was given no rest when they were in his rooms. It\nseemed that love had roused them to song, like the birds. But they were\nby a long way not so skilled in singing. Aurora had no illusions as to\nher talent, but she was quite otherwise about her fianc\u00e9: she could see\nno difference between Georges's playing and Christophe's. Perhaps she\npreferred Georges's style, and Georges, in spite of his ironic subtlety,\nwas never far from being convinced by his sweetheart's belief in him.\nChristophe never contradicted them: maliciously he would concur in the\ngirl's opinion (except when, as sometimes happened, he could bear it no\nlonger, and would rush away, banging the doors). With an affectionate,\npitying smile he would listen to Georges playing _Tristan_ on the\npiano. The unhappy young man would conscientiously apply himself to the\ntranscription of the formidable pages with all the amiable sweetness of\na young girl, and a young girl's tender feeling. Christophe used to\nlaugh to himself. He would never tell the boy why he laughed. He would\nkiss him. He loved him as he was. Perhaps he loved him the more for\nit.... Poor boy!... Oh! the vanity of art!...\n",
                "He used often to talk about \"his children\"--(for so he called them)--to\nEmmanuel. Emmanuel, who was fond of Georges, used jokingly to say that\nChristophe ought to hand him aver to him. He had Aurora, and it was not\nfair. He was grabbing everything.\n",
                "Their friendship had become almost legendary in Parisian society, though\nthey lived apart from it. Emmanuel had grown passionately devoted to\nChristophe, though his pride would not let him show it. He covered it up\nwith his brusque manners, and sometimes used to be absolutely rude to\nChristophe. But Christophe was not deceived. He knew how deeply attached\nto him Emmanuel was, and he knew the worth of his affection. No week\nwent by but they met two or three times. When they were prevented by\nill-health from going out, they used to write to each other. Their\nletters might have been written from places far removed from Paris. They\nwere less interested in external happenings than in the progress of the\nmind in science and art. They lived in their ideas, pondering their art,\nor beneath the chaos of facts perceiving the little undistinguished\ngleam which reveals the progress of the history of the human mind.\n",
                "Generally it was Christophe who visited Emmanuel. Although, since a\nrecent illness, he was not much better in health than his friend, he had\ngrown used to thinking that Emmanuel's health called for more\nconsideration than his own. Christophe could not now ascend Emmanuel's\nsix flights of stairs without difficulty, and when he reached the top he\nhad to wait a moment to recover his breath. They were both incapable of\ntaking care of themselves. In defiance of their weak throats and their\nfits of despondency, they were inveterate smokers. That was one of the\nreasons why Christophe preferred that they should meet in Emmanuel's\nrooms rather than in his own, for Aurora used to declare war on his\nhabit of smoking, and he used to hide away from her. Sometimes they\nwould both break out coughing in the middle of their conversation, and\nthen they would break off and look at each other guiltily like\nschoolboys, and laugh: and sometimes one would lecture the other while\nhe was coughing; but as soon as he had recovered his breath the other\nwould vigorously protest that smoking had nothing to do with it.\n",
                "On Emmanuel's table, in a clear space among the papers, a gray cat would\nsit and gravely look at the smokers with an air of reproach. Christophe\nused to say that it was their living conscience, and, by way of stifling\nit, he would cover it up with his hat. It was a wretched beast, of the\ncommonest kind, that Emmanuel had picked up half-dead in the street; it had\nnever really recovered from the brutal handling it had received, and\nate very little, and hardly ever played, and never made any noise: it\nwas very gentle, and used to follow its master about with its\nintelligent eyes, and be unhappy when he was absent, and quite content\nto sit on the table by his side, only breaking off its musing\necstatically, for hours together, to watch the cage where the\ninaccessible birds fluttered about, purring politely at the least mark\nof attention, patiently submitting to Emmanuel's capricious, and\nChristophe's rough, attentions, and always being very careful not to\nscratch or bite. It was very delicate, and one of its eyes was always\nweeping: it used to cough: and if it had been able to speak it would\ncertainly not have had the effrontery, like the two men, to declare that\n\"the smoke had nothing to do with it\"; but it accepted everything at\ntheir hands, and seemed to think:\n",
                "\"They are men. They know what they are doing.\" Emmanuel was fond of the\nbeast because he saw a certain similarity between its lot and his own.\nChristophe used to declare that the resemblance was even extended to the\nexpression in their eyes.\n",
                "\"Why not?\" Emmanuel would say.\n",
                "Animals reflect their surroundings. Their faces grow refined or the\nreverse according to the people with whom they live. A fool's cat has a\ndifferent expression from that of a clever man's cat. A domestic animal\nwill become good or bad, frank or sly, sensitive or stupid, not only\naccording to what its master teaches it, but also according to what its\nmaster is. And this is true not only of the influence of men. Places\nfashion animals in their own image. A clear, bright landscape will light\nup the eyes of animals.--Emmanuel's gray cat was in harmony with the\nstuffy garret and its ailing master, who lived under the Parisian sky.\n",
                "Emmanuel had grown more human. He was not the same man that he had been\nat the time of his first acquaintance with Christophe. He had been\nprofoundly shaken by a domestic tragedy. His companion, whom, in a\nmoment of exasperation, he had made too clearly feel how tiresome the\nburden of her affection was to him, had suddenly disappeared. Frantic\nwith anxiety, he spent a whole night looking for her, and at last he\nfound her in a police station where she was being retained. She had\ntried to throw herself into the Seine; a passer-by had caught hold of\nher by the clothes, and pulled her back just as she was clambering over\nthe parapet of the bridge; she had refused to give her name and address,\nand made another attempt on her life. The sight of her grief had\noverwhelmed Emmanuel; he could not bear the thought that, having\nsuffered so much at the hands of others, he, in his turn, was causing\nsuffering. He brought the poor crazed creature back to his rooms, and\ndid his best to heal the wound he had dealt her, and to win her back to\nthe confidence in his affection she so sorely needed. He suppressed his\nfeeling of revolt, and resigned himself to her absorbing love, and\ndevoted to her the remainder of his life. The whole sap of his genius\nhad rushed back to his heart. The apostle of action had come to the\nbelief that there was only one course of action that was really\ngood--not to do evil. His part was played. It seemed that the Force\nwhich raises the great human tides had used him only as an instrument,\nto let loose action. Once his orders were carried out, he was nothing:\naction pursued its way without him. He watched it moving on, almost\nresigned to the injustice which touched him personally, though not\naltogether to that which concerned his faith. For although, as a\nfree-thinker, he claimed to be free of all religion and used humorously\nto call Christophe a clerical in disguise, like every sturdy spirit, he\nhad his altar on which he deified the dreams to which he sacrificed\nhimself. The altar was deserted now, and Emmanuel suffered. How could he\nwithout suffering see the blessed ideas, which he had so hardly led to\nvictory, the ideas for which, during the last hundred years, all the\nfinest men had suffered such bitter torment--how could he see them\ntramped underfoot by the oncoming generation? The whole magnificent\ninheritance of French idealism--the faith in Liberty, which had its\nsaints, martyrs, heroes, the love of humanity, the religious aspiration\ntowards the brotherhood of nations and races--all, all was with blind\nbrutality pillaged by the younger generation! What madness is it in them\nthat makes them sigh for the monsters we had vanquished, submit to the\nyoke that we had broken, call back with great shouts the reign of Force,\nand kindle Hatred and the insanity of war in the heart of my beloved\nFrance!\n",
                "\"It is not only in France,\" Christophe would say laughingly, \"it is\nthroughout the entire world. From Spain to China blows the same keen\nwind. There is not a corner anywhere for a man to find shelter from the\nwind! It is becoming a joke: even in my little Switzerland, which is\nturning nationalist!\"\n",
                "\"You find that comforting?\"\n",
                "\"Certainly. It shows that such waves of feeling are not due to the\nridiculous passions of a few men, but to a hidden God who controls the\nuniverse. And I have learned to bow before that God. If I do not\nunderstand Him, that is my fault, not His. Try to understand Him. But\nhow many of you take the trouble to do that? You live from day to day,\nand see no farther than the next milestone, and you imagine that it\nmarks the end of the road. You see the wave that bears you along, but\nyou do not see the sea! The wave of to-day is the wave of yesterday; it\nis the wave of our souls that prepared the way for it. The wave of\nto-day will plow the ground for the wave of to-morrow, which will wipe\nout its memory as the memory of ours is wiped out. I neither admire nor\ndread the naturalism of the present time. It will pass away with the\npresent time: it is passing, it has already passed. It is a rung in the\nladder. Climb to the top of it! It is the advance-guard of the coming\narmy. Hark to the sound of its fifes and drums!...\"\n",
                "(Christophe drummed on the table, and woke the cat, which sprang away.)\n",
                "\"... Every nation now feels the imperious necessity of gathering its\nforces and making up its balance-sheet. For the last hundred years all\nthe nations have been transformed by their mutual intercourse and the\nimmense contributions of all the brains of the universe, building up new\nmorality, new knowledge, new faith. Every man must examine his\nconscience, and know exactly what he is and what he has, before he can\nenter with the rest into the new age. A new age is coming. Humanity is\non the point of signing a new lease of life. Society is on the point of\nspringing into new vigor with new laws. It is Sunday to-morrow. Every\none is making up his accounts for the week, setting his house in order,\nmaking it clean and tidy, that, with other men, we may go into the\npresence of our common God and make a new compact of alliance with Him.\"\n",
                "Emmanuel looked at Christophe, and his eyes reflected the passing\nvision. He was silent for some time after Christophe had finished\nspeaking, and then he said:\n",
                "\"You are lucky, Christophe! You do not see the night!\"\n",
                "\"I can see in the dark,\" said Christophe. \"I have lived in it enough. I\nam an old owl.\"\n",
                "About this time his friends noticed a change in his manner. He was often\ndistracted and absent-minded. He hardly listened to what was said to\nhim. He had an absorbed, smiling expression. When his absent-mindedness\nwas commented upon he would gently excuse himself. Sometimes he would\nspeak of himself in the third person:\n",
                "\"Krafft will do that for you....\"\n",
                "or,\n",
                "\"Christophe will laugh at that....\"\n",
                "People who did not know him said:\n",
                "\"What extraordinary self-infatuation!\"\n",
                "But it was just the opposite. He saw himself from the outside, as a\nstranger. He had reached the stage when a man loses interest even in the\nstruggle for the beautiful, because, when a man has done his work, he is\ninclined to believe that others will do theirs, and that, when all is\ntold, as Rodin says, \"the beautiful will always triumph.\" The\nmalevolence and injustice of men did not repel him.--He would laugh and\ntell himself that it was not natural, that life was ebbing away from\nhim.\n",
                "In fact, he had lost much of his old vigor. The least physical effort, a\nlong walk, a fast drive, exhausted him. He quickly lost his breath, and\nhe had pains in his heart. Sometimes he would think of his old friend\nSchulz. He never told anybody what he was feeling. It was no good. It\nwas useless to upset his friends, and he would never get any better.\nBesides he did not take his symptoms seriously. He far more dreaded\nhaving to take care of himself than being ill.\n",
                "He had an inward presentiment and a desire to see his country once more.\nHe had postponed going from year to year, always saying--\"next year....\"\nNow he would postpone it no longer.\n",
                "He did not tell any one, and went away by stealth. The journey was\nshort. Christophe found nothing that he had come to seek. The changes\nthat had been in the making on his last visit were now fully\naccomplished: the little town had become a great industrial city. The\nold houses had disappeared. The cemetery also was gone. Where Sabine's\nfarm had stood was now a factory with tall chimneys. The river had\nwashed away the meadows where Christophe had played as a child. A street\n(and such a street!) between black buildings bore his name. The whole of\nthe past was dead, even death itself.... So be it! Life was going on:\nperhaps other little Christophes were dreaming, suffering, struggling,\nin the shabby houses in the street that was called after him.--At a\nconcert in the gigantic _Tonhalle_ he heard some of his music\nplayed, all topsy-turvy: he hardly recognized it.... So be it! Though it\nwere misunderstood it might perhaps arouse new energy. We sowed the\nseed. Do what you will with it: feed on us.--At nightfall Christophe\nwalked through the fields outside the city; great mists were rolling\nover them, and he thought of the great mists that should enshroud his\nlife, and those whom he had loved, who were gone from the earth, who had\ntaken refuge in his heart, who, like himself, would be covered up by the\nfalling night.... So be it! So be it! I am not afraid of thee, O night,\nthou devourer of suns! For one star that is put out, thousands are lit up.\nLike a bowl of boiling milk, the abysm of space is overflowing with\nlight. Thou shalt not put me out. The breath of death will set the flame\nof my life flickering up once more....\n",
                "On his return from Germany, Christophe wanted to stop in the town where\nhe had known Anna. Since he had left it, he had had no news of her. He\nhad never dared to ask after her. For years her very name was enough to\nupset him....--Now he was calm and had no fear. But in the evening, in\nhis room in the hotel looking out on the Rhine, the familiar song of the\nbells ringing in the morrow's festival awoke the images of the past.\nFrom the river there ascended the faint odor of distant danger, which he\nfound it hard to understand. He spent the whole night in recollection.\nHe felt that he was free of the terrible Lord, and found sweet sadness\nin the thought. He had not made up his mind what to do on the following\nday. For a moment--(the past lay so far behind!)--he thought of calling\non the Brauns. But when the morrow came his courage failed him: he dared\nnot even ask at the hotel whether the doctor and his wife were still\nalive. He made up his mind to go....\n",
                "When the time came for him to go an irresistible force drove him to the\nchurch which Anna used to attend: he stood behind a pillar from which he\ncould see the seat where in old days she used to come and kneel. He\nwaited, feeling sure that, if she were still alive, she would come.\n",
                "A woman did come, and he did not recognize her. She was like all the\nrest, plump, full-faced, with a heavy chin, and an indifferent, hard\nexpression. She was dressed in black. She sat down in her place, and did\nnot stir. There was nothing in the woman to remind Christophe of the\nwoman he was expecting. Only once or twice she made a certain queer\nlittle gesture as though to smooth out the folds of her skirt about her\nknees. In old days, _she_ had made such a gesture,... As she went\nout she passed slowly by him, with her head erect and her hands holding\nher prayer-book, folded in front of her. For a moment her somber, tired\neyes met Christophe's. And they looked at each other. And they did not\nrecognize each other. She passed on, straight and stiff, and never\nturned her head. It was only after a moment that suddenly, in a flash of\nmemory, beneath the frozen smile, he recognized the lips he had kissed\nby a certain fold in them.... He gasped for breath and his knees\ntrembled. He thought:\n",
                "\"Lord, is that the body in which she dwelt whom I loved? Where is she?\nWhere is she? And where am I, myself? Where is the man who loved her?\nWhat is there left of us and the cruel love that consumed us?--Ashes.\nWhere is the fire?\"\n",
                "And his God answered and said:\n",
                "\"In Me.\"\n",
                "Then he raised his eyes and saw her for the last time in the crowd\npassing through the door into the sunlight.\n",
                "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
                "It was shortly after his return to Paris that he made peace with big old\nenemy, L\u00e9vy-Coeur, who had been attacking him for a long time with equal\nmalicious talent and bad faith. Then, having attained the highest\nsuccess, glutted with honors, satiated, appeased, he had been clever\nenough secretly to recognize Christophe's superiority, and had made\nadvances to him. Christophe pretended to notice neither attacks nor\nadvances. L\u00e9vy-Coeur wearied of it. They lived in the same neighborhood\nand used often to meet. As they passed each other Christophe would look\nthrough L\u00e9vy-Coeur, who was exasperated by this calm way of ignoring his\nexistence.\n",
                "He had a daughter between eighteen and twenty, a pretty, elegant girl,\nwith a profile like a lamb, a cloud of curly fair hair, soft coquettish\neyes, and a Luini smile. They used to go for walks together, and\nChristophe often met them in the Luxembourg Gardens; they seemed very\nintimate, and the girl would walk arm-in-arm with her father.\nAbsent-minded though he was, Christophe never failed to notice a pretty\nface, and he had a weakness for the girl. He would think of L\u00e9vy-Coeur:\n",
                "\"Lucky beast!\"\n",
                "But then he would add proudly:\n",
                "\"But I too have a daughter.\"\n",
                "And he used to compare the two. In the comparison his bias was all in\nfavor of Aurora, but it led him to create in his mind a sort of\nimaginary friendship between the two girls, though they did not know\neach other, and even, without his knowing it, to a certain feeling for\nL\u00e9vy-Coeur.\n",
                "When he returned from Germany he heard that \"the lamb\" was dead. In his\nfatherly selfishness his first thought was:\n",
                "\"Suppose it had been mine!\"\n",
                "And he was filled with an immense pity for L\u00e9vy-Coeur. His first impulse\nwas to write to him: he began two letters, but was not satisfied, was\nashamed of them, and did not send either. But a few days later when he\nmet L\u00e9vy-Coeur with a weary, miserable face, it was too much for him: he\nwent straight up to the poor wretch and held out both hands to him.\nL\u00e9vy-Coeur, with a little hesitation, took them in his. Christophe said:\n",
                "\"You have lost her!...\"\n",
                "The emotion in his voice touched L\u00e9vy-Coeur. It was so unexpected! He\nfelt inexpressibly grateful.... They talked for a little sadly and\nconfusedly. When they parted nothing was left of all that had divided\nthem. They had fought: it was inevitable, no doubt: each man must fulfil\nthe law of his nature! But when men see the end of the tragi-comedy\ncoming, they put off the passions that masked them, and meet face to\nface,--two men, of whom neither is of much greater worth than the other,\nwho, when they have played their parts to the best of their ability,\nhave the right in the end to shake hands.\n",
                "The marriage of Georges and Aurora had been fixed for the early spring.\nChristophe's health was declining rapidly. He had seen his children\nwatching him anxiously. Once he heard them whispering to each other.\nGeorges was saying:\n",
                "\"How ill he looks! He looks as though he might fall ill at any moment.\"\n",
                "And Aurora replied:\n",
                "\"If only he does not delay our marriage!\"\n",
                "He did not forget it. Poor children! They might be sure that he would\nnot disturb their happiness!\n",
                "But he was inconsiderate enough on the eve of the marriage--(he had been\nabsurdly excited as the day drew near: as excited as though it were he\nwho was going to be married)--he was stupid enough to be attacked by his\nold trouble, a recurrence of pneumonia, which had first attacked him in\nthe days of the Market-Place. He was furious with himself, and dubbed\nhimself fool and idiot. He swore that he would not give in until the\nmarriage had taken place. He thought of Grazia as she lay dying, never\ntelling him of her illness because of his approaching concert, for fear\nlest he should be distracted from his work and pleasure. Now he loved\nthe idea of doing for her daughter--for her--what she had done for him.\nHe concealed his condition, but he found it hard to keep himself going.\nHowever, the happiness of his children made him so happy that he managed\nto support the long ordeal of the religious ceremony without disaster.\nBut he had hardly reached Colette's house than his strength gave out: he\nhad just time enough to shut himself up in a room, and then he fainted.\nHe was found by a servant. When he came to himself Christophe forbade\nthem to say anything to the bride and bridegroom, who were going off on\ntheir honeymoon in the evening. They were too much taken up with\nthemselves to notice anything else. They left him gaily, promising to\nwrite to him to-morrow, and afterwards....\n",
                "As soon as they were gone, Christophe took to his bed. He was feverish,\nand could not shake off the fever. He was alone. Emmanuel was ill too,\nand could not come. Christophe did not call in a doctor. He did not\nthink his condition was serious. Besides, he had no servant to go for a\ndoctor. The housekeeper who came for two hours in the morning took no\ninterest in him, and he dispensed with her services. He had a dozen\ntimes begged her not to touch any of his papers when she was dusting his\nroom. She would do it: she thought she had a fine opportunity to do as\nshe liked, now that he was confined to his bed. In the mirror of his\nwardrobe door he saw her from his bed turning the whole room upside\ndown. He was so furious--(no, assuredly the old Adam was not dead in\nhim!)--that he jumped out of bed, snatched a packet of papers out of her\nhands, and showed her the door. His anger cost him a bout of fever and\nthe departure of the servant, who lost her temper and never returned,\nwithout even taking the trouble to tell the \"old madman,\" as she called\nhim. So he was left, ill, with no one to look after him. He would get up\nin the morning to take in the jug of milk left at the door, and to see\nif the portress had not slipped under the door the promised letter from\nthe lovers. The letter did not come: they had forgotten him in their\nhappiness. He was not angry with them, and thought that in their place\nhe would have done the same. He thought of their careless joy, and that\nit was he had given it to them.\n",
                "He was a little better and was able to get up when at last a letter came\nfrom Aurora. Georges had been content to add his signature. Aurora asked\nvery little about Christophe and told very little, but, to make up for\nit, she gave him a commission, begging him to send her a necktie she had\nleft at Colette's. Although it was not at all important--(Aurora had\nonly thought of it as she sat down to write to Christophe, and then only\nbecause she wanted something to say),--Christophe was only too delighted\nto be of use, and went out at once to fetch it. The weather was cold and\ngusty. The winter had taken an unpleasant turn. Melting snow, and an icy\nwind. There were no carriages to be had. Christophe spent some time in a\nparcels' office. The rudeness of the clerks and their deliberate\nslowness made him irritable, which did not help his business on. His\nillness was partly responsible for his gusts of anger, which the\ntranquillity of his mind repudiated; they shook his body, like the last\ntremors of an oak falling under the blows of an ax. He returned chilled\nand trembling. As he entered, the portress handed him a cutting from a\nreview. He glanced at it. It was a spiteful attack upon himself. They\nwere growing rare in these days. There is no pleasure in attacking a man\nwho never notices the blows dealt him. The most violent of his enemies\nwere reduced to a feeling of respect for him, which exasperated them,\nfor they still detested him.\n",
                "_\"We believe,\"_ said Bismarck, almost regretfully, _\"that nothing\nis more involuntary than love. Respect is even more so....\"_\n",
                "But the writer of the article was one of those strong men, who, being\nbetter armed than Bismarck, escape both respect and love. He spoke of\nChristophe in insulting terms, and announced a series of attacks during\nthe following fortnight: Christophe began to laugh, and said as he went\nto bed again:\n",
                "\"He will be surprised! He won't find me at home!\"\n",
                "They tried to make him have a nurse, but he refused obstinately, saying\nthat he had lived alone so much that he thought he might at least have\nthe benefit of his solitude at such a time.\n",
                "He was never bored. During these last years he had constantly been\nengrossed in dialogues with himself; it was as though his soul was\ntwofold; and for some months past his inward company had been\nconsiderably augmented: not two souls, but ten, now dwelt in him. They\nheld converse among themselves, though more often they sang. He would\ntake part in their conversation, or he would hold his peace and listen\nto them. He had always on his bed, or on the table, within reach of his\nhand, music-paper on which he used to take down their remarks and his\nown, and laugh at their rejoinders. It was a mechanical habit: the two\nactions, thinking and writing, had become almost simultaneous with him;\nwriting was thinking out loud to him. Everything that took him away from\nthe company of his many souls exhausted and irritated him, even the\nfriends he loved best, sometimes. He tried hard not to let them see it,\nbut such constraint induced an extreme lassitude. He was very happy when\nhe came to himself again, for he would lose himself: it was impossible\nto hear the inward voices amid the chattering of human beings. Divine\nsilence!...\n",
                "He would only allow the portress or one of her children to come three\nor four times a day to see if he needed anything. He used to give them the\nnotes which, up to the last, he exchanged with Emmanuel. They were\nalmost equally ill, and were under no illusion as to their condition. By\ndifferent ways the free religious genius of Christophe and the free\nirreligious genius of Emmanuel had reached the same brotherly serenity.\nIn their wavering handwriting, which they found it more and more\ndifficult to read, they discoursed, not of their illness, but of the\nperpetual subject of their conversations, their art, and the future of\ntheir ideas.\n",
                "This went on until the day when, with his failing hand, Christophe wrote\nthe words of the King of Sweden, as he lay dying on the field of battle:\n",
                "_\"Ich habe genug, Bruder: rette dich!\"_\n[FOOTNOTE: \"I have had my fill, brother: save thyself!\"]\n",

                "As a succession of stages he looked back over the whole of his life: the\nimmense effort of his youth to win self-possession, his desperate struggles\nto exact from others the bare right to live, to wrest himself\nfrom the demons of his race. And even after the victory, the forced\nunending vigil over the fruits of conquest, to defend them against\nvictory itself. The sweetness, the tribulation of friendship opening up\nthe great human family through conflict to the isolated heart. The\nfullness of art, the zenith of life. His proud dominion over his\nconquered spirit. His belief that he had mastered his destiny. And then,\nsuddenly at the turn of the road, his meeting with the knights of the\nApocalypse, Grief, Passion, Shame, the vanguard of the Lord. Then laid\nlow, trampled underfoot by the horses, dragging himself bleeding to the\nheights, where, in the midst of the clouds, flames the wild purifying\nfire. His meeting face to face with God. His wrestling with Him, like\nJacob with the Angel. His issue, broken from the fight. His adoration of\nhis defeat, his understanding of his limitations, his striving to fulfil\nthe will of the Lord, in the domain assigned to him. Finally, when the\nlabors of seed-time and harvest, the splendid hard work, were at an end,\nhaving won the right to rest at the feet of the sunlit mountains, and to\nsay to them:\n",

                "Then the beloved had appeared to him: she had taken him by the hand; and\ndeath, breaking down the barrier of her body, had poured the pure soul\nof the beloved into the soul of her lover. Together they had issued from\nthe shadow of days, and they had reached the happy heights where, like\nthe three Graces, in a noble round, the past, the present, and the\nfuture, clasped hands, where the heart at rest sees griefs and joys in\none moment spring to life, flower, and die, where all is Harmony....\n",
                "He was in too great a hurry. He thought he had already reached that\nplace. The vise which gripped his panting bosom, and the tumultuous\nwhirl of images beating against the walls of his burning brain, reminded\nhim that the last stage and the hardest was yet to run.... Onward!...\n",

                "He lay motionless upon his bed. In the room above him some silly woman\nwould go on playing the piano for hours. She only knew one piece, and\nshe would go on tirelessly repeating the same bars; they gave her so\nmuch pleasure! They were a joy, an emotion to her; every color, every\nkind of form was in them. And Christophe could understand her happiness,\nbut she made him weep with exasperation. If only she would not hit the\nkeys so hard! Noise was as odious to Christophe as vice.... In the end\nhe became resigned to it. It was hard to learn not to hear. And yet it\nwas less difficult than he thought. He would leave his sick, coarse\nbody. How humiliating it was to have been shut up in it for so many\nyears! He would watch its decay and think:\n",
                "\"It will not go on much longer.\"\n",
                "He would feel the pulse of his human egoism and wonder:\n",
                "\"Which would you prefer? To have the name and personality of Christophe\nbecome immortal and his work disappear, or to have his work endure and\nno trace be left of his personality and name?\"\n",
                "Without a moment's hesitation he replied:\n",
                "\"Let me disappear and my work endure! My gain is twofold: for only what\nis most true of me, the real truth of myself will remain. Let Christophe\nperish!...\"\n",
                "But very soon he felt that he was becoming as much a stranger to his\nwork as to himself. How childish was the illusion of believing that his\nart would endure! He saw clearly not only how little he had done, but\nhow surely all modern music was doomed to destruction. More quickly than\nany other the language of music is consumed by its own heat; at the end\nof a century or two it is understood only by a few initiates. For how\nmany do Monteverdi and Lully still exist? Already the oaks of the\nclassic forest are eaten away with moss. Our buildings of sound, in\nwhich our passions sing, will soon be empty temples, will soon crumble\naway into oblivion.--And Christophe was amazed to find himself gazing at\nthe ruins untroubled.\n",
                "\"Have I begun to love life less?\" he wondered.\n",
                "But at once he understood that he loved it more.... Why weep over the\nruins of art? They are not worth it. Art is the shadow man casts upon\nNature. Let them disappear together, sucked up by the sun's rays! They\nprevent my seeing the sun.--The vast treasure of Nature passes through\nour fingers. Human intelligence tries to catch the running water in the\nmeshes of a net. Our music is an illusion. Our scale of sounds is an\ninvention. It answers to no living sound. It is a compromise of the mind\nbetween real sounds, the application of the metric system to the moving\ninfinite. The mind needs such a lie as this to understand the\nincomprehensible, and the mind has believed the lie, because it wished\nto believe it. But it is not true. It is not alive. And the delight\nwhich the mind takes in this order of its own creation has only been\nobtained by falsifying the direct intuition of what is. From time to time,\na genius, in passing contact with the earth, suddenly perceives\nthe torrent of reality, overflowing the continents of art. The dykes\ncrack for a moment. Nature creeps in through a fissure. But at once the\ngap is stopped up. It must be done to safeguard the reason of mankind.\nIt would perish if its eyes met the eyes of Jehovah. Then once more it\nbegins to strengthen the walls of its cell, which nothing enters from\nwithout, except it have first been wrought upon. And it is beautiful,\nperhaps, for those who will not see.... But for me, I will see Thy face,\nJehovah! I will hear the thunder of Thy voice, though it bring me to\nnothingness. The noise of art is an hindrance to me. Let the mind hold\nits peace! Let man be silent!...\n",

And now he looked at himself, touched\nhimself, sought and could not find himself. He seemed to himself to be\n\"another.\" Another, dearer than himself.... Who?... It seemed to him\nthat in his dreams another soul had taken possession of him. Olivier?\nGrazia?... His heart and his head were so weak! He could not distinguish\nbetween his loved ones. Why should he distinguish between them? He loved\nthem all equally.\n",
                "He lay bound in a sort of overwhelming beatitude. He made no attempt to\nmove. He knew that sorrow lay in ambush for him, like a cat waiting for\na mouse. He lay like one dead.

Christophe was passionately absorbed in gazing at the branch\nof a tree that grew in front of the window. The branch was swelling, the\nmoist buds were bursting, the little white flowers were expanding; and\nin the flowers, in the leaves, in the whole tree coming to new life,\nthere was such an ecstasy of surrender to the new-born force of spring,\nthat Christophe was no longer conscious of his weariness, his\ndepression, his wretched, dying body, and lived again in the branch of\nthe tree. He was steeped in the gentle radiance of its life. It was like\na kiss. His heart, big with love, turned to the beautiful tree, smiling\nthere upon his last moments. He thought that at that moment there were\ncreatures loving each other, that to others this hour, that was so full\nof agony for him, was an hour of ecstasy, that it is ever thus, and that\nthe puissant joy of living never runs dry. And in a choking voice that\nwould not obey his thoughts--(possibly no sound at all came from his\nlips, but he knew it not)--he chanted a hymn to life.\n",
                "An invisible orchestra answered him. Christophe said within himself:\n",

                "He tried to sit up so as to see the whole orchestra, and beat time with\nhis arms outstretched. But the orchestra made no mistake; they were sure\nof themselves. What marvelous music! How wonderfully they improvised the\nresponses! Christophe was amused.\n",
