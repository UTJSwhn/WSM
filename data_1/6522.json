                "Those who walk on the path of pride crushing the lowly life under their tread,\ncovering the tender green of the earth with their footprints in blood;",
                "Let them rejoice, and thank thee, Lord, for the day is theirs.",
                "But I am thankful that my lot lies with the humble who suffer and bear the\nburden of power, and hide their faces and stifle their sobs in the dark.",
                "For every throb of their pain has pulsed in the secret depth of thy night, and\nevery insult has been gathered into thy great silence. And the morrow is\ntheirs.",
                "O Sun, rise upon the bleeding hearts blossoming in flowers of the morning, and\nthe torchlight revelry of pride shrunken to ashes.",
                "THE END"
