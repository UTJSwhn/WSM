Hi! Threes about there! Trot!\"\n\n   All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know\n   By word or act official who read off that helio.\n\n   But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Mooltan\n   They know the worthy General as \"that most immoral man.\""

Had I gone by Kakahutti,\n   On the old Hill-road and rutty, I had 'scaped that fatal car.\n   But his fortune each must bide by, so I watched the milestones slide by,\n   To \"You call on Her tomorrow!\" -- fugue with cymbals by the bar -- \n\n   \"You must call on Her tomorrow!\" -- post-horn gallop by the bar.\n\n   Yet a further stage my goal on -- we were whirling down to Solon,\n   With a double lurch and roll on, best foot foremost, ganz und gar -- \n   \"She was very sweet,\" I hinted. \"If a kiss had been imprinted?\" -- \n   \"'Would ha' saved a world of trouble!\" clashed the busy tonga-bar.\n\n   \"'Been accepted or rejected!\" banged and clanged the tonga-bar.\n\n   Then a notion wild and daring, 'spite the income tax's paring,\n   And a hasty thought of sharing -- less than many incomes are,\n   Made me put a question private, you can guess what I would drive at.\n   \"You must work the sum to prove it,\" clanked the careless tonga-bar.\n\n   \"Simple Rule of Two will prove it,\" lilted back the tonga-bar.\n\n   It was under Khyraghaut I mused. \"Suppose the maid be haughty -- \n   (There are lovers rich -- and rotty) -- wait some wealthy Avatar?\n   Answer monitor untiring, 'twixt the ponies twain perspiring!\"\n    \"Faint heart never won fair lady,\" creaked the straining tonga-bar.\n\n   \"Can I tell you ere you ask Her?\" pounded slow the tonga-bar.\n\n   Last, the Tara Devi turning showed the lights of Simla burning,\n   Lit my little lazy yearning to a fiercer flame by far.\n\n   As below the Mall we jingled, through my very heart it tingled -- \n   Did the iterated order of the threshing tonga-bar -- \n\n   \"Try your luck -- you can't do better!\" twanged the loosened tonga-bar."

leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,\n   But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.\n\n   There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,\n   And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.\n\n   They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,\n   The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.\n\n   The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,\n   And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.\n\n   He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,\n   \"'Twas only by favour of mine,\" quoth he, \"ye rode so long alive:\n   There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,\n   But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.\n\n   \"If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,\n   The little jackals that flee so fast were

their fires when all the cattle are slain.\n\n   \"But if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,\n   The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!\n   And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,\n   Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!\"\n\n   Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.\n   \"No talk shall be of dogs,\" said he, \"when wolf and gray wolf meet.\n\n   \"May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;\n   What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?\"\n    Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  \"I hold by the blood of my clan:\n   Take up the mare for my father's gift -- by God, she has carried a man!\"\n    The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;\n   \"We be two strong men,\" said Kamal then, \"but she loveth the younger best.\n\n   So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,\n   My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.\"\n    The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,\n   \"Ye have taken the one from a foe,\" said he;\n     \"will ye take the mate from a friend?\"\n    \"A gift for a gift,\" said Kamal straight; \"a limb for the risk of a limb.\n\n   \"Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!\"\n    With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest -- \n   He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.\n\n   \"Now here is thy master,\" Kamal said, \"who leads a troop of the Guides,\n   And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.\n   Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,\n   Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.\n\n   \"So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,\n   And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,\n   And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power -- \n   Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.\"\n\n   They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,\n   They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:\n   They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,\n   On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.\n\n   The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,\n   And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.\n\n   And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear -- \n   There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.\n\n   \"Ha' done! ha' done!\" said the Colonel's son.\n     \"Put up the steel at your sides!\n   Last night ye had struck at a Border thief -- \n     tonight 'tis a man of the Guides!\"\n\n        Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,\n        Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;\n        But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\n        When two strong men stand face to face,\n          tho' they come from the ends of the earth!"

At the close of a winter day,\n   Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay;\n   And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye,\n   And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby,\n   And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall,\n   And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all.\n\n   Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the\n   sheer,\n   When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer.\n\n   Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze,\n   Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas.\n\n   Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,\n   And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.\n\n   \"I ha' paid Port dues for your Law,\" quoth he, \"and where is the Law ye boast\n   If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast?\n   Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk,\n   We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk;\n   I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare\n   Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre.\n\n   \"There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,\n   And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore.\n\n   \"He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black,\n   But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack.\n   He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan;\n   But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own.\n\n   \"He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line,\n   He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;\n   He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas,\n   He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?\n   My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats;\n   He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats.\n\n   \"I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,\n   But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied.\n\n   \"Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm,\n   I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm;\n   I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw,\n   And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw;\n   I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark,\n   I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark;\n   I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil,\n   And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil;\n   I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, and tasselled his beard i' the\n   mesh,\n   And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened\n   flesh;\n   I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, where the mud-reef sucks and\n   draws,\n   Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!\n   He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow,\n   For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!\"\n    The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold,\n   And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold,\n   And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt: -- \n   \"Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut.\n\n   \"Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus:\n   He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us.\n\n   \"We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair,\n   And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre.\n\n   \"And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you,\n   We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true.\"\n    The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- \"And what is that to me?\n   Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three?\n   Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line?\n   He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine.\n\n   \"There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in,\n   But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin.\n\n   \"Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel?\n   Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? 'Fore Gad, then, why does he\n   steal?\"\n    The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet,\n   For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet.\n\n   But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: -- \n   \"We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman.\"\n    The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: -- \n   \"'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!\"\n    By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: -- \n   \"We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair.\"\n    The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: -- \n   \"They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm.\"\n    The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad,\n   The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord.\n\n   Masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft;\n   The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed: -- \n   \"It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again -- \n   Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain.\n\n   \"It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea, and the swing of the unbought\n   brine -- \n   We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line:\n   Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer,\n   Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer;\n   Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty,\n   Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea.\n\n   \"Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack,\n   We are paid in the coin of the white man's trade -- the bezant is hard, ay, and\n   black.\n\n   \"The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut\n   How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port;\n   How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there\n   Shall dip their flag to a slaver's rag -- to show that his trade is fair!\""

                "The Spirit gripped him by the hair, and sun by sun they fell\n   Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell:\n   The first are red with pride and wrath, the next are white with pain,\n   But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again:\n   They may hold their path, they may leave their path, with never a soul to\n   mark,\n   They may burn or freeze, but they must not cease in the Scorn of the Outer\n   Dark.\n\n   The Wind that blows between the worlds, it nipped him to the bone,\n   And he yearned to the flare of Hell-Gate there as the light of his own hearth-\n   stone.\n\n   The Devil he sat behind the bars, where the desperate legions drew,\n   But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through.\n\n   \"Wot ye the price of good pit-coal that I must pay?\" said he,\n   \"That ye rank yoursel' so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me?\n   I am all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that ye should give me scorn,\n   For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born.\n\n   \"Sit down, sit down upon the slag, and answer loud and high\n   The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die.\"\n    And Tomlinson looked up and up, and saw against the night\n   The belly of a tortured star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light;\n   And Tomlinson looked down and down, and saw beneath his feet\n   The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat.\n\n   \"O I had a love on earth,\" said he, \"that kissed me to my fall,\n   And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all.\"\n     -- \"All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair,\n   But now ye wait at Hell-Mouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square:\n   Though we whistled your love from her bed tonight, I trow she would not run,\n   For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one!\"\n    The Wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,\n   And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life: -- \n   \"Once I ha' laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave,\n   And thrice I ha' patted my God on the head that men might call me brave.\"\n    The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool: -- \n   \"Do ye think I would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool?\n   I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did\n   That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid.\"\n    Then Tomlinson looked back and forth, and there was little grace,\n   For Hell-Gate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space.\n\n   \"Nay, this I ha' heard,\" quo'  Tomlinson, \"and this was noised abroad,\n   And this I ha' got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord.\"\n     -- \"Ye ha' heard, ye ha' read, ye ha' got, good lack!

                "May no ill dreams disturb my rest,\n     Nor Powers of Darkness me molest.\n              -- Evening Hymn.",
                "ONE of the few advantages that India has over England is a great\n      Knowability. After five years' service a man is directly or indirectly\n      acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all\n      the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen\n      hundred other people of the non-official caste. In ten years his knowledge\n      should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows something\n      about, every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel anywhere and\n      everywhere without paying hotel-bills.",
                "Globe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within my\n      memory, blunted this open-heartedness, but none the less today, if you\n      belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep, all\n      houses are open to you, and our small world is very, very kind and\n      helpful.",
                "Rickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon some fifteen years ago.\n      He meant to stay two nights, but was knocked down by rheumatic fever, and\n      for six weeks disorganized Polder's establishment, stopped Polder's work,\n      and nearly died in Polder's bedroom. Polder behaves as though he had been\n      placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and yearly sends the little\n      Ricketts a box of presents and toys. It is the same everywhere. The men\n      who do not take the trouble to conceal from you their opinion that you are\n      an incompetent ass, and the women who blacken your character and\n      misunderstand your wife's amusements, will work themselves to the bone in\n      your behalf if you fall sick or into serious trouble.",
                "Heatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in addition to his regular practice, a\n      hospital on his private account -- an arrangement of loose boxes for\n      Incurables, his friend called it -- but it was really a sort of\n      fitting-up shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather. The\n      weather in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is always a\n      fixed quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work\n      overtime and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as\n      mixed as the metaphors in this sentence.",
                "Heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was, and his invariable\n      prescription to all his patients is, \"lie low, go slow, and keep cool.\" He\n      says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this\n      world justifies. He maintains that overwork slew Pansay, who died under\n      his hands about three years ago. He has, of course, the right to speak\n      authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in\n      Pansay's head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and pressed\n      him to death. \"Pansay went off the handle,\" says Heatherlegh, \"after the\n      stimulus of long leave at Home. He may or he may not have behaved like a\n      blackguard to Mrs. Keith-Wessington. My notion is that the work of the\n      Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs, and that he took to brooding\n      and making much of an ordinary P. & 0. flirtation. He certainly was\n      engaged to Miss Mannering, and she certainly broke off the engagement.\n      Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about ghosts\n      developed. Overwork started his illness, kept it alight, and killed him\n      poor devil. Write him off to the System -- one man to take the work of\n      two and a half men.\"",
                "I do not believe this. I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when\n      Heatherlegh was called out to patients, and I happened to be within claim.\n      The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low, even voice, the\n      procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed. He had a sick\n      man's command of language.",
                "When he recovered I suggested that he should write out the whole affair\n      from beginning to end, knowing that ink might assist him to ease his mind.\n      When little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy till\n      they have chalked it up on a door. And this also is Literature.",
                "He was in a high fever while he was writing, and the blood-and-thunder\n      Magazine diction he adopted did not calm him. Two months afterward he was\n      reported fit for duty, but, in spite of the fact that he was urgently\n      needed to help an undermanned Commission stagger through a deficit, he\n      preferred to die; vowing at the last that he was hag-ridden. I got his\n      manuscript before he died, and this is his version of the affair, dated\n      1885:",
                "My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of air. It is not\n      improbable that I shall get both ere long -- rest that neither the\n      red-coated messenger nor the midday gun can break, and change of air far\n      beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can give me. In the meantime\n      I am resolved to stay where I am; and, in flat defiance of my doctor's\n      orders, to take all the world into my confidence. You shall learn for\n      yourselves the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too, judge for\n      yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth was ever so\n      tormented as I.",
                "Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the drop-bolts are\n      drawn, my story, wild and hideously improbable as it may appear, demands\n      at least attention. That it will ever receive credence I utterly\n      disbelieve. Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man\n      who had dared tell me the like. Two months ago I was the happiest man in\n      India. Today, from Peshawur to the sea, there is no one more wretched. My\n      doctor and I are the only two who know this. His explanation is, that my\n      brain, digestion, and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise to\n      my frequent and persistent \"delusions.\" Delusions, indeed! I call him a\n      fool; but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile, the same\n      bland professional manner, the same neatly trimmed red whiskers, till I\n      begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid. But you\n      shall judge for yourselves.",
                "Three years ago it was my fortune -- my great misfortune -- to sail\n      from Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long leave, with one Agnes\n      Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side. It does not in\n      the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was. Be content\n      with the knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I were\n      desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another. Heaven knows that\n      I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity. In matters of\n      this sort there is always one who gives and another who accepts. From the\n      first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was conscious that Agnes's\n      passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and -- if I may use the\n      expression -- a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she recognized the\n      fact then, I do not know. Afterward it was bitterly plain to both of us.",
                "Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective ways,\n      to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave and her\n      love took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together; and there\n      my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing year.\n      I attempt no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington had given up much\n      for my sake, and was prepared to give up all. From my own lips, in August,\n      1882, she learned that I was sick of her presence, tired of her company,\n      and weary of the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine women out of a hundred\n      would have wearied of me as I wearied of them; seventy-five of that number\n      would have promptly avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation\n      with other men. Mrs. Wessington was the hundredth. On her neither my\n      openly expressed aversion nor the cutting brutalities with which I\n      garnished our interviews had the least effect. \"Jack, darling!\" was her\n      one eternal cuckoo cry: \"I'm sure it's all a mistake -- a hideous\n      mistake; and we'll be good friends again some day. Please forgive me,\n      Jack, dear.\"",
                "I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity into\n      passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate -- the same\n      instinct, I suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider\n      he has but half killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882\n      came to an end.",
                "Next year we met again at Simla -- she with her monotonous face and\n      timid attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every\n      fibre of my frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and\n      on each occasion her words were identically the same. Still the\n      unreasoning wail that it was all a \"mistake\"; and still the hope of\n      eventually \"making friends.\" I might have seen had I cared to look, that\n      that hope only was keeping her alive. She grew more wan and thin month by\n      month. You will agree with me, at least, that such conduct would have\n      driven any one to despair. It was uncalled for; childish; unwomanly. I\n      maintain that she was much to blame. And again, sometimes, in the black,\n      fever-stricken night-watches, I have begun to think that I might have been\n      a little kinder to her. But that really is a \"delusion.\" I could not have\n      continued pretending to love her when I didn't; could I? It would have\n      been unfair to us both.",
                "Last year we met again -- on the same terms as before. The same weary\n      appeal, and the same curt answers from my lips. At least I would make her\n      see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the old\n      relationship. As the season wore on, we fell apart -- that is to say,\n      she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more absorbing\n      interests to attend to. When I think it over quietly in my sick-room, the\n      season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade were\n      fantastically intermingled -- my courtship of little Kitty Mannering;\n      my hopes, doubts, and fears; our long rides together; my trembling avowal\n      of attachment; her reply; and now and again a vision of a white face\n      flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the black and white liveries I once\n      watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessington's gloved hand; and,\n      when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome monotony of her\n      appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering; honestly, heartily loved her, and with my\n      love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August Kitty and I were engaged.\n      The next day I met those accursed \"magpie\" jhampanies at the back of\n      Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of pity, stopped to tell Mrs.\n      Wessington everything. She knew it already.",
                "\"So I hear you're engaged, Jack dear.\" Then, without a moment's pause -- \"I'm\n      sure it's all a mistake -- a hideous mistake. We shall be as good\n      friends some day, Jack, as we ever were.\"",
                "My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman before\n      me like the blow of a whip. \"Please forgive me, Jack; I didn't mean to\n      make you angry; but it's true, it's true!\"",
                "And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to\n      finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that I\n      had been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she had\n      turned her 'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me.",
                "The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory.",
                "The rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden,\n      dingy pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed a\n      gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the\n      jhampanies, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's down-bowed\n      golden head stood out clearly. She was holding her handkerchief in her\n      left hand and was leaning back exhausted against the 'rickshaw cushions. I\n      turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie Reservoir and literally ran\n      away. Once I fancied I heard a faint call of \"Jack!\" This may have been\n      imagination. I never stopped to verify it. Ten minutes later I came across\n      Kitty on horseback; and, in the delight of a long ride with her, forgot\n      all about the interview.",
                "A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her\n      existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy.\n      Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except that\n      at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly\n      of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred what was left of\n      our correspondence from among my scattered belongings and had burned it.\n      At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was at Simla -- semi-deserted\n      Simla -- once more, and was deep in lover's talks and walks with Kitty.\n      It was decided that we should be married at the end of June. You will\n      understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I did, I am not saying too\n      much when I pronounce myself to have been, at that time, the happiest man\n      in India.",
                "Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight.",
                "Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals circumstanced\n      as we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement ring was the outward\n      and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and that she must\n      forthwith come to Hamilton's to be measured for one. Up to that moment, I\n      give you my word, we had completely forgotten so trivial a matter. To\n      Hamilton's we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885. Remember that -- whatever\n      my doctor may say to the contrary -- I was then in perfect health,\n      enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolute tranquil spirit. Kitty and I\n      entered Hamilton's shop together, and there, regardless of the order of\n      affairs, I measured Kitty for the ring in the presence of the amused\n      assistant. The ring was a sapphire with two diamonds. We then rode out\n      down the slope that leads to the Combermere Bridge and Peliti's shop.",
                "While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and\n      Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side -- while all Simla, that\n      is to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped\n      round the Reading-room and Peliti's veranda, -- I was aware that some\n      one, apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name.\n      It struck me that I had heard the voice before, but when and where I could\n      not at once determine. In the short space it took to cover the road\n      between the path from Hamilton's shop and the first plank of the\n      Combermere Bridge I had thought over half a dozen people who might have\n      committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided that it must have\n      been singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Peliti's shop my eye was\n      arrested by the sight of four jharnpanies in \"magpie\" livery, pulling a\n      yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw. In a moment my mind flew back to\n      the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense of irritation and\n      disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with, without\n      her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the day's happiness?\n      Whoever employed them now I thought I would call upon, and ask as a\n      personal favor to change her jhampanies' livery. I would hire the men\n      myself, and, if necessary, buy their coats from off their backs. It is\n      impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their presence\n      evoked.",
                "\"Kitty,\" I cried, \"there are poor Mrs. Wessington's jhampanies turned up\n      again! I wonder who has them now?\"",
                "Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always been\n      interested in the sickly woman. \"What? Where?\" she asked. \"I can't see\n      them anywhere.\"",
                "Even as she spoke her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself\n      directly in front of the advancing 'rickshaw. I had scarcely time to utter\n      a word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider passed\n      through men and carriage as if they had been thin air.",
                "\"What's the matter?\" cried Kitty; \"what made you call out so foolishly,\n      Jack? If I am engaged I don't want all creation to know about it. There\n      was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you think I\n      can't ride --",
                "\" -- There!\"",
                "Whereupon wilful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a\n      hand-gallop in the direction of the Bandstand; fully expecting, as she\n      herself afterward told me, that I should follow her. What was the matter?\n      Nothing indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla was haunted\n      with devils. I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round. The 'rickshaw\n      had turned too, and now stood immediately facing me, near the left railing\n      of the Combermere Bridge.",
                "\"Jack! Jack, darling!\" (There was no mistake about the words this time:\n      they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) \"It's\n      some hideous mistake, I'm sure. Please forgive me, jack, and let's be\n      friends again.\"",
                "The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and pray daily\n      for the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief in\n      hand, and golden head bowed on her breast.",
                "How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by my\n      syce taking the Waler's bridle and asking whether I was ill. From the\n      horrible to the commonplace is but a step. I tumbled off my horse and\n      dashed, half fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of cherry-brandy. There\n      two or three couples were gathered round the coffee-tables discussing the\n      gossip of the day. Their trivialities were more comforting to me just then\n      than the consolations of religion could have been. I plunged into the\n      midst of the conversation at once; chatted, laughed, and jested with a\n      face (when I caught a glimpse of it in a mirror) as white and drawn as\n      that of a corpse. Three or four men noticed my condition; and, evidently\n      setting it down to the results of over-many pegs, charitably endeavoured\n      to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers. But I refused to be led\n      away. I wanted the company of my kind -- as a child rushes into the\n      midst of the dinner-party after a fright in the dark. I must have talked\n      for about ten minutes or so, though it seemed an eternity to me, when I\n      heard Kitty's clear voice outside inquiring for me. In another minute she\n      had entered the shop, prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so\n      signally in my duties. Something in my face stopped her.",
                "\"Why, Jack,\" she cried, \"what have you been doing? What has happened? Are\n      you ill?\" Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the sun had been a\n      little too much for me. It was close upon five o'clock of a cloudy April\n      afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my mistake as soon\n      as the words were out of my mouth: attempted to recover it; blundered\n      hopelessly and followed Kitty in a regal rage, out of doors, amid the\n      smiles of my acquaintances. I made some excuse (I have forgotten what) on\n      the score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to my hotel, leaving\n      Kitty to finish the ride by herself.",
                "In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter.",
                "Here was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in the\n      year of grace, 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in terror\n      from my sweetheart's side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead\n      and buried eight months ago. These were facts that I could not blink.\n      Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs. Wessington\n      when Kitty and I left Hamilton's shop. Nothing was more utterly\n      commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Peliti's. It was broad\n      daylight. The road was full of people; and yet here, look you, in defiance\n      of every law of probability, in direct outrage of Nature's ordinance,\n      there had appeared to me a face from the grave.",
                "Kitty's Arab had gone through the 'rickshaw: so that my first hope that\n      some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage and the\n      coolies with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went round this\n      treadmill of thought; and again and again gave up baffled and in despair.\n      The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition. I had originally some\n      wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty; of begging her to marry me at\n      once; and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the 'rickshaw.\n      \"After all,\" I argued, \"the presence of the 'rickshaw is in itself enough\n      to prove the existence of a spectral illusion. One may see ghosts of men\n      and women, but surely never of coolies and carriages. The whole thing is\n      absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hill-man!\"",
                "Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook my\n      strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very\n      wroth, and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency\n      born of night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked\n      with sudden palpitation of the heart -- the result of indigestion. This\n      eminently practical solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out that\n      afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us.",
                "Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still\n      unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,\n      suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road -- anything\n      rather than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt: so I\n      yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out\n      together toward Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and,\n      according to our custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent to\n      the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched horses\n      appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we neared the\n      crest of the ascent. My mind had been full of Mrs. Wessington all the\n      afternoon; and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our oldtime\n      walks and talks. The bowlders were full of it; the pines sang it aloud\n      overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over the\n      shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud.",
                "As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladies' Mile\n      the Horror was awaiting me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight -- only the\n      four black and white jhampanies, the yellow-paneled carriage, and the\n      golden head of the woman within -- all apparently just as I had left\n      them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that\n      Kitty must see what I saw -- we were so marvelously sympathetic in all\n      things. Her next words undeceived me -- \"Not a soul in sight! Come\n      along, Jack, and I'll race you to the Reservoir buildings!\" Her wiry\n      little Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in\n      this order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within\n      fifty yards of the 'rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little.\n      The 'rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road; and once more the\n      Arab passed through it, my horse following. \"Jack! Jack dear! Please\n      forgive me,\" rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval: -- \"It's\n      a mistake, a hideous mistake!\"",
                "I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at the\n      Reservoir works, the black and white liveries were still waiting -- patiently\n      waiting -- under the grey hillside, and the wind brought me a mocking\n      echo of the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered me a good deal on my\n      silence throughout the remainder of the ride. I had been talking up till\n      then wildly and at random.",
                "To save my life I could not speak afterward naturally, and from Sanjowlie\n      to the Church wisely held my tongue.",
                "I was to dine with the Mannerings that night, and had barely time to\n      canter home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men\n      talking together in the dusk. -- \"It's a curious thing,\" said one, \"how\n      completely all trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely fond\n      of the woman ('never could see anything in her myself), and wanted me to\n      pick up her old 'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for love or\n      money. Morbid sort of fancy I call it; but I've got to do what the\n      Memsahib tells me.",
                "\"Would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four\n      of the men -- they were brothers -- died of cholera on the way to\n      Hardwar, poor devils, and the 'rickshaw has been broken up by the man\n      himself. 'Told me he never used a dead Memsahib's 'rickshaw. 'Spoiled his\n      luck.' Queer notion, wasn't it? Fancy poor little Mrs. Wessington spoiling\n      any one's luck except her own!\" I laughed aloud at this point; and my\n      laugh jarred on me as I uttered it. So there were ghosts of 'rickshaws\n      after all, and ghostly employments in the other world! How much did Mrs.\n      Wessington give her men? What were their hours? Where did they go?",
                "And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal Thing\n      blocking my path in the twilight. The dead travel fast, and by short cuts\n      unknown to ordinary coolies. I laughed aloud a second time and checked my\n      laughter suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad. Mad to a certain\n      extent I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my horse at the\n      head of the 'rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington \"Good evening.\"\n       Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened to the end; and\n      replied that I had heard it all before, but should be delighted if she had\n      anything further to say. Some malignant devil stronger than I must have\n      entered into me that evening, for I have a dim recollection of talking the\n      commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the Thing in front of me.",
                "\"Mad as a hatter, poor devil -- or drunk. Max, try and get him to come\n      home.\"",
                "Surely that was not Mrs. Wessington's voice! The two men had overheard me\n      speaking to the empty air, and had returned to look after me. They were\n      very kind and considerate, and from their words evidently gathered that I\n      was extremely drunk. I thanked them confusedly and cantered away to my\n      hotel, there changed, and arrived at the Mannerings' ten minutes late. I\n      pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse; was rebuked by Kitty for\n      my unlover-like tardiness; and sat down.",
                "The conversation had already become general; and under cover of it, I was\n      addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware that\n      at the further end of the table a short red-whiskered man was describing,\n      with much broidery, his encounter with a mad unknown that evening.",
                "A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half an\n      hour ago. In the middle of the story he looked round for applause, as\n      professional story-tellers do, caught my eye, and straightway collapsed.\n      There was a moment's awkward silence, and the red-whiskered man muttered\n      something to the effect that he had \"forgotten the rest,\" thereby\n      sacrificing a reputation as a good story-teller which he had built up for\n      six seasons past. I blessed him from the bottom of my heart, and -- went\n      on with my fish.",
                "In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end; and with genuine regret\n      I tore myself away from Kitty -- as certain as I was of my own\n      existence that It would be waiting for me outside the door. The\n      red-whiskered man, who had been introduced to me as Doctor Heatherlegh, of\n      Simla, volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together. I\n      accepted his offer with gratitude.",
                "My instinct had not deceived me. It lay in readiness in the Mall, and, in\n      what seemed devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp. The\n      red-whiskered man went to the point at once, in a manner that showed he\n      bad been thinking over it all dinner time.",
                "\"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on the\n      Elysium road?\" The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer from me\n      before I was aware.",
                "\"That!\" said I, pointing to It.",
                "\"That may be either D. T. or Eyes for aught I know. Now you don't liquor.\n      I saw as much at dinner, so it can't be D. T. There's nothing whatever\n      where you're pointing, though you're sweating and trembling with fright\n      like a scared pony. Therefore, I conclude that it's Eyes. And I ought to\n      understand all about them. Come along home with me. I'm on the Blessington\n      lower road.\"",
                "To my intense delight the 'rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about\n      twenty yards ahead -- and this, too whether we walked, trotted, or\n      cantered. In the course of that long night ride I had told my companion\n      almost as much as I have told you here.",
                "\"Well, you've spoiled one of the best tales I've ever laid tongue to,\"\n       said he, \"but I'll forgive you for the sake of what you've gone through.\n      Now come home and do what I tell you; and when I've cured you, young man,\n      let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and indigestible food\n      till the day of your death.\"",
                "The 'rickshaw kept steady in front; and my red-whiskered friend seemed to\n      derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts.",
                "\"Eyes, Pansay -- all Eyes, Brain, and Stomach. And the greatest of\n      these three is Stomach. You've too much conceited Brain, too little\n      Stomach, and thoroughly unhealthy Eyes. Get your Stomach straight and the\n      rest follows. And all that's French for a liver pill.",
                "\"I'll take sole medical charge of you from this hour! for you're too\n      interesting a phenomenon to be passed over.\"",
                "By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road and\n      the 'rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pine-clad, over-hanging shale\n      cliff. Instinctively I halted too, giving my reason. Heatherlegh rapped\n      out an oath.",
                "\"Now, if you think I'm going to spend a cold night on the hillside for the\n      sake of a stomach-cum-Brain-cum-Eye illusion -- Lord, ha' mercy! What's\n      that?\"",
                "There was a muffled report, a blinding smother of dust just in front of\n      us, a crack, the noise of rent boughs, and about ten yards of the\n      cliff-side -- pines, undergrowth, and all -- slid down into the road\n      below, completely blocking it up. The uprooted trees swayed and tottered\n      for a moment like drunken giants in the gloom, and then fell prone among\n      their fellows with a thunderous crash. Our two horses stood motionless and\n      sweating with fear. As soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had\n      subsided, my companion muttered: -- \"Man, if we'd gone forward we\n      should have been ten feet deep in our graves by now. 'There are more\n      things in heaven and earth...' Come home, Pansay, and thank God. I want a\n      peg badly.\"",
                "We retraced our way over the Church Ridge, and I arrived at Dr.\n      Heatherlegh's house shortly after midnight.",
                "His attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately, and for a week I\n      never left his sight. Many a time in the course of that week did I bless\n      the good fortune which had thrown me in contact with Simla's best and\n      kindest doctor. Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable. Day\n      by day, too, I became more and more inclined to fall in with Heatherlegh's\n      \"spectral illusion\" theory, implicating eyes, brain, and stomach. I wrote\n      to Kitty, telling her that a slight sprain caused by a fall from my horse\n      kept me indoors for a few days; and that I should be recovered before she\n      had time to regret my absence.",
                "Heatherlegh's treatment was simple to a degree. It consisted of liver\n      pills, cold-water baths, and strong exercise, taken in the dusk or at\n      early dawn -- for, as he sagely observed: -- \"A man with a sprained\n      ankle doesn't walk a dozen miles a day, and your young woman might be\n      wondering if she saw you.\"",
                "At the end of the week, after much examination of pupil and pulse, and\n      strict injunction' as to diet and pedestrianism, Heatherlegh dismissed me\n      as brusquely as he had taken charge of me. Here is his parting\n      benediction: -- \"Man, I can certify to your mental cure, and that's as\n      much as to say I've cured most of your bodily ailments. Now, get your\n      traps out of this as soon as you can; and be off to make love to Miss\n      Kitty.\"",
                "I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness. He cut me short.",
                "\"Don't think I did this because I like you. I gather that you've behaved\n      like a blackguard all through. But, all the same, you re a phenomenon, and\n      as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard. No!\" -- checking me a\n      second time -- \"not a rupee please. Go out and see if you can find the\n      eyes-brain-and-stomach business again. I'll give you a lakh for each time\n      you see it.\"",
                "Half an hour later I was in the Mannerings' drawing-room with Kitty -- drunk\n      with the intoxication of present happiness and the fore-knowledge that I\n      should never more be troubled with Its hideous presence. Strong in the\n      sense of my new-found security, I proposed a ride at once; and, by\n      preference, a canter round Jakko.",
                "Never had I felt so well, so overladen with vitality and mere animal\n      spirits, as I did on the afternoon of the 30th of April. Kitty was\n      delighted at the change in my appearance, and complimented me on it in her\n      delightfully frank and outspoken manner. We left the Mannerings' house\n      together, laughing and talking, and cantered along the Chota Simla road as\n      of old.",
                "I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my\n      assurance doubly sure. The horses did their best, but seemed all too slow\n      to my impatient mind. Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness. \"Why,\n      Jack!\" she cried at last, \"you are behaving like a child. What are you\n      doing?\"",
                "We were just below the Convent, and from sheer wantonness I was making my\n      Waler plunge and curvet across the road as I tickled it with the loop of\n      my riding-whip.",
                "\"Doing?\" I answered; \"nothing, dear. That's just it. If you'd been doing\n      nothing for a week except lie up, you'd be as riotous as I.\"",
                "\"'Singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth, Joying to feel yourself\n      alive; Lord over Nature, Lord of the visible Earth, Lord of the senses\n      five.'\"",
                "My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner\n      above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to\n      Sanjowlie. In the centre of the level road stood the black and white\n      liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington. I\n      pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said\n      something. The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on the\n      road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.",
                "\"Has it gone, child?\" I gasped. Kitty only wept more bitterly.",
                "\"Has what gone, Jack dear? what does it all mean? There must be a mistake\n      somewhere, Jack. A hideous mistake.\" Her last words brought me to my feet -- mad -- raving\n      for the time being.",
                "\"Yes, there is a mistake somewhere,\" I repeated, \"a hideous mistake. Come\n      and look at It.\"",
                "I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist along the road\n      up to where It stood, and implored her for pity's sake to speak to It; to\n      tell It that we were betrothed; that neither Death nor Hell could break\n      the tie between us; and Kitty only knows how much more to the same effect.\n      Now and again I appealed passionately to the Terror in the 'rickshaw to\n      bear witness to all I had said, and to release me from a torture that was\n      killing me. As I talked I suppose I must have told Kitty of my old\n      relations with Mrs. Wessington, for I saw her listen intently with white\n      face and blazing eyes.",
                "\"Thank you, Mr. Pansay,\" she said, \"that's quite enough. Syce ghora lao.\"",
                "The syces, impassive as Orientals always are, had come up with the\n      recaptured horses; and as Kitty sprang into her saddle I caught hold of\n      the bridle, entreating her to hear me out and forgive. My answer was the\n      cut of her riding-whip across my face from mouth to eye, and a word or two\n      of farewell that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and judged\n      rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back to the side of the\n      'rickshaw. My face was cut and bleeding, and the blow of the riding-whip\n      had raised a livid blue wheal on it. I had no self-respect. Just then,\n      Heatherlegh, who must have been following Kitty and me at a distance,\n      cantered up.",
                "\"Doctor,\" I said, pointing to my face, \"here's Miss Mannering's signature\n      to my order of dismissal and -- I'll thank you for that lakh as soon as\n      convenient.\"",
                "Heatherlegh's face, even in my abject misery, moved me to laughter.",

                "\"Don't be a fool,\" I whispered. \"I've lost my life's happiness and you'd\n      better take me home.\"",
                "As I spoke the 'rickshaw was gone. Then I lost all knowledge of what was\n      passing. The crest of Jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a\n      cloud and fall in upon me.",
                "Seven days later (on the 7th of May, that is to say) I was aware that I\n      was lying in Heatherlegh's room as weak as a little child. Heatherlegh was\n      watching me intently from behind the papers on his writing-table. His\n      first words were not encouraging; but I was too far spent to be much moved\n      by them.",

This mood would in time give place to\n      another where it seemed that the 'rickshaw and I were the only realities\n      in a world of shadows; that Kitty was a ghost; that Mannering,\n      Heatherlegh, and all the other men and women I knew were all ghosts; and\n      the great, grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised to torture me.\n      From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward for seven weary days; my\n      body growing daily stronger and stronger, until the bedroom looking-glass\n      told me that I had returned to everyday life, and was as other men once\n      more. Curiously enough my face showed no signs of the struggle I had gone\n      through. It was pale indeed, but as expressionless and commonplace as\n      ever. I had expected some permanent alteration -- visible evidence of\n      the disease that was eating me away. I found nothing.",
                "On the 15th of May, I left Heatherlegh's house at eleven o'clock in the\n      morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club. There I\n      found that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in\n      clumsy fashion, abnormally kind and attentive. Nevertheless I recognized\n      that for the rest of my natural life I should be among but not of my\n      fellows; and I envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the\n      Mall below. I lunched at the Club, and at four o'clock wandered aimlessly\n      down the Mall in the vague hope of meeting Kitty. Close to the Band-stand\n      the black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs. Wessington's old\n      appeal at my side. I had been expecting this ever since I came out; and\n      was only surprised at her delay. The phantom 'rickshaw and I went side by\n      side along the Chota Simla road in silence. Close to the bazar, Kitty and\n      a man on horseback overtook and passed us. For any sign she gave I might\n      have been a dog in the road. She did not even pay me the compliment of\n      quickening her pace; though the rainy afternoon had served for an excuse.",
                "So Kitty and her companion, and I and my ghostly Light-o'-Love, crept\n      round Jakko in couples. The road was streaming with water; the pines\n      dripped like roof-pipes on the rocks below, and the air was full of fine,\n      driving rain. Two or three times I found myself saying to myself almost\n      aloud: \"I'm Jack Pansay on leave at Simla -- at Simla! Everyday,\n      ordinary Simla. I mustn't forget that -- I mustn't forget that.\" Then I\n      would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard at the Club: the\n      prices of So-and-So's horses -- anything, in fact, that related to the\n      workaday Anglo-Indian world I knew so well. I even repeated the\n      multiplication-table rapidly to myself, to make quite sure that I was not\n      taking leave of my senses. It gave me much comfort; and must have\n      prevented my hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.",
                "Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level road.\n      Here Kitty and the man started off at a canter, and I was left alone with\n      Mrs. Wessington. \"Agnes,\" said I, \"will you put back your hood and tell me\n      what it all means?\" The hood dropped noiselessly, and I was face to face\n      with my dead and buried mistress. She was wearing the dress in which I had\n      last seen her alive; carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand;\n      and the same cardcase in her left. (A woman eight months dead with a\n      cardcase!) I had to pin myself down to the multiplication-table, and to\n      set both hands on the stone parapet of the road, to assure myself that\n      that at least was real.",
                "\"Agnes,\" I repeated, \"for pity's sake tell me what it all means.\" Mrs.\n      Wessington leaned forward, with that odd, quick turn of the head I used to\n      know so well, and spoke.",
                "If my story had not already so madly overleaped the hounds of all human\n      belief I should apologize to you now. As I know that no one -- no, not\n      even Kitty, for whom it is written as some sort of justification of my\n      conduct -- will believe me, I will go on. Mrs. Wessington spoke and I\n      walked with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the\n      Commander-in-Chief's house as I might walk by the side of any living\n      woman's 'rickshaw, deep in conversation. The second and most tormenting of\n      my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me, and like the Prince\n      in Tennyson's poem, \"I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts.\" There had\n      been a garden-party at the Commander-in-Chief's, and we two joined the\n      crowd of homeward-bound folk. As I saw them then it seemed that they were\n      the shadows -- impalpable, fantastic shadows -- that divided for\n      Mrs. Wessington's 'rickshaw to pass through. What we said during the\n      course of that weird interview I cannot -- indeed, I dare not -- tell.\n      Heatherlegh's comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that I\n      had been \"mashing a brain-eye-and-stomach chimera.\" It was a ghastly and\n      yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience. Could it be\n      possible, I wondered, that I was in this life to woo a second time the\n      woman I had killed by my own neglect and cruelty?",
                "I met Kitty on the homeward road -- a shadow among shadows.",
                "If I were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their\n      order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would Be\n      exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly\n      'rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went\n      there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company to\n      and from my hotel. At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd of yelling\n      jhampanies; outside the Club veranda, after a long evening of whist; at\n      the Birthday Ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and in broad\n      daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the 'rickshaw\n      was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron. More\n      than once, indeed, I have had to check myself from warning some\n      hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have walked\n      down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the unspeakable\n      amazement of the passers-by.",
                "Before I had been out and about a week I learned that the \"fit\" theory had\n      been discarded in favor of insanity. However, I made no change in my mode\n      of life. I called, rode, and dined out as freely as ever. I had a passion\n      for the society of my kind which I had never felt before; I hungered to be\n      among the realities of life; and at the same time I felt vaguely unhappy\n      when I had been separated too long from my ghostly companion. It would be\n      almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of May up to\n      today.",
                "The presence of the 'rickshaw filled me by turns with horror, blind fear,\n      a dim sort of pleasure, and utter despair. I dared not leave Simla; and I\n      knew that my stay there was killing me. I knew, moreover, that it was my\n      destiny to die slowly and a little every day. My only anxiety was to get\n      the penance over as quietly as might be. Alternately I hungered for a\n      sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations with my successor -- to\n      speak more accurately, my successors -- with amused interest. She was\n      as much out of my life as I was out of hers. By day I wandered with Mrs.\n      Wessington almost content. By night I implored Heaven to let me return to\n      the world as I used to know it. Above all these varying moods lay the\n      sensation of dull, numbing wonder that the Seen and the Unseen should\n      mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its grave.",
                "August 27. -- Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on\n      me; and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application for\n      sick leave. An application to escape the company of a phantom! A request\n      that the Government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts\n      and an airy 'rickshaw by going to England. Heatherlegh's proposition moved\n      me to almost hysterical laughter. I told him that I should await the end\n      quietly at Simla; and I am sure that the end is not far off. Believe me\n      that I dread its advent more than any word can say; and I torture myself\n      nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of my death.",
                "Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentleman should die; or,\n      in one last walk on the Mall, will my soul be wrenched from me to take its\n      place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm? Shall I\n      return to my old lost allegiance in the next world, or shall I meet Agnes\n      loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity? Shall we two\n      hover over the scene of our lives till the end of Time? As the day of my\n      death draws nearer, the intense horror that all living flesh feels toward\n      escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and more powerful. It is\n      an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with scarcely one-half of\n      your life completed. It is a thousand times more awful to wait as I do in\n      your midst, for I know not what unimaginable terror. Pity me, at least on\n      the score of my \"delusion,\" for I know you will never believe what I have\n      written here Yet as surely as ever a man was done to death by the Powers\n      of Darkness I am that man.",
                "In justice, too, pity her. For as surely as ever woman was killed by man,\n      I killed Mrs. Wessington. And the last portion of my punishment is ever\n      now upon me."

                "Somewhere in the Other World, where there are books and pictures and plays\n      and shop windows to look at, and thousands of men who spend their lives in\n      building up all four, lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the\n      real insides of people; and his name is Mr. Walter Besant. But he will\n      insist upon treating his ghosts -- he has published half a workshopful\n      of them -- with levity. He makes his ghost-seers talk familiarly, and,\n      in some cases, flirt outrageously, with the phantoms. You may treat\n      anything, from a Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper, with levity; but you must\n      behave reverently toward a ghost, and particularly an Indian one.",
                "There are, in this land, ghosts who take the form of fat, cold, pobby\n      corpses, and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes. Then\n      they drop upon his neck and remain. There are also terrible ghosts of\n      women who have died in child-bed. These wander along the pathways at dusk,\n      or hide in the crops near a village, and call seductively. But to answer\n      their call is death in this world and the next. Their feet are turned\n      backward that all sober men may recognize them. There are ghosts of little\n      children who have been thrown into wells. These haunt well curbs and the\n      fringes of jungles, and wail under the stars, or catch women by the wrist\n      and beg to be taken up and carried. These and the corpse ghosts, however,\n      are only vernacular articles and do not attack Sahibs. No native ghost has\n      yet been authentically reported to have frightened an Englishman; but many\n      English ghosts have scared the life out of both white and black.",
                "Nearly every other Station owns a ghost. There are said to be two at\n      Simla, not counting the woman who blows the bellows at Syree dak-bungalow\n      on the Old Road; Mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively Thing; a\n      White Lady is supposed to do night-watchman round a house in Lahore;\n      Dalhousie says that one of her houses \"repeats\" on autumn evenings all the\n      incidents of a horrible horse-and-precipice accident; Murree has a merry\n      ghost, and, now that she has been swept by cholera, will have room for a\n      sorrowful one; there are Officers' Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open\n      without reason, and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak, not with the\n      heat of June but with the weight of Invisibles who come to lounge in the\n      chairs; Peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent; and there\n      is something -- not fever -- wrong with a big bungalow in Allahabad.\n      The older Provinces simply bristle with haunted houses, and march phantom\n      armies along their main thoroughfares.",
                "Some of the dak-bungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy little\n      cemeteries in their compound -- witnesses to the \"changes and chances\n      of this mortal life\" in the days when men drove from Calcutta to the\n      Northwest. These bungalows are objectionable places to put up in. They are\n      generally very old, always dirty, while the khansamah is as ancient as the\n      bungalow. He either chatters senilely, or falls into the long trances of\n      age. In both moods he is useless. If you get angry with him, he refers to\n      some Sahib dead and buried these thirty years, and says that when he was\n      in that Sahib's service not a khansamah in the Province could touch him.\n      Then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes, and\n      you repent of your irritation.",
                "In these dak-bungalows, ghosts are most likely to be found, and when\n      found, they should be made a note of. Not long ago it was my business to\n      live in dak-bungalows. I never inhabited the same house for three nights\n      running, and grew to be learned in the breed. I lived in Government-built\n      ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings, an inventory of the furniture\n      posted in every room, and an excited snake at the threshold to give\n      welcome. I lived in \"converted\" ones -- old houses officiating as\n      dak-bungalows -- where nothing was in its proper place and there wasn't\n      even a fowl for dinner. I lived in second-hand palaces where the wind blew\n      through open-work marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a broken\n      pane. I lived in dak-bungalows where the last entry in the visitors' book\n      was fifteen months old, and where they slashed off the curry-kid's head\n      with a sword. It was my good luck to meet all sorts of men, from sober\n      traveling missionaries and deserters flying from British Regiments, to\n      drunken loafers who threw whisky bottles at all who passed; and my still\n      greater good fortune just to escape a maternity case. Seeing that a fair\n      proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in\n      dak-bungalows, I wondered that I had met no ghosts. A ghost that would\n      voluntarily hang about a dak-bungalow would be mad of course; but so many\n      men have died mad in dak-bungalows that there must be a fair percentage of\n      lunatic ghosts.",
                "In due time I found my ghost, or ghosts rather, for there were two of\n      them. Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr. Besant's method of\n      handling them, as shown in \"The Strange Case of Mr. Lucraft and Other\n      Stories.\" I am now in the Opposition.",
                "We will call the bungalow Katmal dak-bungalow. But THAT was the smallest\n      part of the horror. A man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in\n      dak-bungalows. He should marry. Katmal dak-bungalow was old and rotten and\n      unrepaired. The floor was of worn brick, the walls were filthy, and the\n      windows were nearly black with grime. It stood on a bypath largely used by\n      native Sub-Deputy Assistants of all kinds, from Finance to Forests; but\n      real Sahibs were rare. The khansamah, who was nearly bent double with old\n      age, said so.",
                "When I arrived, there was a fitful, undecided rain on the face of the\n      land, accompanied by a restless wind, and every gust made a noise like the\n      rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside. The khansamah\n      completely lost his head on my arrival. He had served a Sahib once. Did I\n      know that Sahib? He gave me the name of a well-known man who has been\n      buried for more than a quarter of a century, and showed me an ancient\n      daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth. I had seen a steel\n      engraving of him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs a month before,\n      and I felt ancient beyond telling.",
                "The day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food. He did not go\n      through the pretense of calling it \"khana\" -- man's victuals. He said\n      \"ratub,\" and that means, among other things, \"grub\" -- dog's rations.\n      There was no insult in his choice of the term. He had forgotten the other\n      word, I suppose.",
                "While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself down,\n      after exploring the dak-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside my own,\n      which was a corner kennel, each giving into the other through dingy white\n      doors fastened with long iron bars. The bungalow was a very solid one, but\n      the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built in their\n      flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the\n      other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls.\n      For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps -- only candles in\n      long glass shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.",
                "For bleak, unadulterated misery that dak-bungalow was the worst of the\n      many that I had ever set foot in. There was no fireplace, and the windows\n      would not open; so a brazier of charcoal would have been useless. The rain\n      and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the house, and the\n      toddy palms rattled and roared.",
                "Half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing, and a hyena stood\n      afar off and mocked them. A hyena would convince a Sadducee of the\n      Resurrection of the Dead -- the worst sort of Dead. Then came the ratub -- a\n      curious meal, half native and half English in composition -- with the\n      old khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone English people,\n      and the wind-blown candles playing shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the\n      mosquito-curtains. It was just the sort of dinner and evening to make a\n      man think of every single one of his past sins, and of all the others that\n      he intended to commit if he lived.",
                "Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy. The lamp in the\n      bath-room threw the most absurd shadows into the room, and the wind was\n      beginning to talk nonsense.",
                "Just when the reasons were drowsy with blood-sucking I heard the regular -- \"Let -- us -- take -- and -- heave -- him -- over\"\n       grunt of doolie-bearers in the compound. First one doolie came in, then a\n      second, and then a third. I heard the doolies dumped on the ground, and\n      the shutter in front of my door shook. \"That's some one trying to come\n      in,\" I said. But no one spoke, and I persuaded myself that it was the\n      gusty wind. The shutter of the room next to mine was attacked, flung back,\n      and the inner door opened. \"That's some Sub-Deputy Assistant,\" I said,\n      \"and he has brought his friends with him. Now they'll talk and spit and\n      smoke for an hour.\"",
                "But there were no voices and no footsteps. No one was putting his luggage\n      into the next room. The door shut, and I thanked Providence that I was to\n      be left in peace. But I was curious to know where the doolies had gone. I\n      got out of bed and looked into the darkness. There was never a sign of a\n      doolie. Just as I was getting into bed again, I heard, in the next room,\n      the sound that no man in his senses can possibly mistake -- the whir of\n      a billiard ball down the length of the slates when the striker is\n      stringing for break. No other sound is like it. A minute afterwards there\n      was another whir, and I got into bed. I was not frightened -- indeed I\n      was not. I was very curious to know what had become of the doolies. I\n      jumped into bed for that reason.",
                "Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up. It is\n      a mistake to say that hair stands up. The skin of the head tightens and\n      you can feel a faint, prickly, bristling all over the scalp. That is the\n      hair sitting up.",
                "There was a whir and a click, and both sounds could only have been made by\n      one thing -- a billiard ball. I argued the matter out at great length\n      with myself; and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one\n      bed, one table, and two chairs -- all the furniture of the room next to\n      mine -- could so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards.\n      After another cannon, a three -- cushion one to judge by the whir, I\n      argued no more. I had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have\n      escaped from that dak-bungalow. I listened, and with each listen the game\n      grew clearer.",
                "There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes there was a double\n      click and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort of doubt, people were\n      playing billiards in the next room. And the next room was not big enough\n      to hold a billiard table!",
                "Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forward -- stroke\n      after stroke. I tried to believe that I could not hear voices; but that\n      attempt was a failure.",
                "Do you know what fear is? Not ordinary fear of insult, injury or death,\n      but abject, quivering dread of something that you cannot see -- fear\n      that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throat -- fear that\n      makes you sweat on the palms of the hands, and gulp in order to keep the\n      uvula at work? This is a fine Fear -- a great cowardice, and must be\n      felt to be appreciated. The very improbability of billiards in a\n      dak-bungalow proved the reality of the thing. No man -- drunk or sober -- could\n      imagine a game at billiards, or invent the spitting crack of a\n      \"screw-cannon.\"",
                "A severe course of dak-bungalows has this disadvantage -- it breeds\n      infinite credulity. If a man said to a confirmed dak-bungalow-haunter: -- \"There\n      is a corpse in the next room, and there's a mad girl in the next but one,\n      and the woman and man on that camel have just eloped from a place sixty\n      miles away,\" the hearer would not disbelieve because he would know that\n      nothing is too wild, grotesque, or horrible to happen in a dak-bungalow.",
                "This credulity, unfortunately, extends to ghosts. A rational person fresh\n      from his own house would have turned on his side and slept. I did not. So\n      surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores of things in the\n      bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so surely did I hear\n      every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind\n      the iron-barred door. My dominant fear was that the players might want a\n      marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures who could play in the\n      dark would be above such superfluities. I only know that that was my\n      terror; and it was real.",
                "After a long, long while the game stopped, and the door banged. I slept\n      because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have preferred to have kept\n      awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the door-bar and\n      peered into the dark of the next room.",
                "When the morning came, I considered that I had done well and wisely, and\n      inquired for the means of departure.",
                "\"By the way, khansamah,\" I said, \"what were those three doolies doing in\n      my compound in the night?\"",
                "\"There were no doolies,\" said the khansamah.",
                "I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open door.\n      I was immensely brave. I would, at that hour, have played Black Pool with\n      the owner of the big Black Pool down below.",
                "\"Has this place always been a dak-bungalow?\" I asked.",
                "\"No,\" said the khansamah. \"Ten or twenty years ago, I have forgotten how\n      long, it was a billiard room.\"",
                "\"A how much?\"",
                "\"A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway. I was khansamah\n      then in the big house where all the Railway-Sahibs lived, and I used to\n      come across with brandy-shrab. These three rooms were all one, and they\n      held a big table on which the Sahibs played every evening. But the Sahibs\n      are all dead now, and the Railway runs, you say, nearly to Kabul.\"",
                "\"Do you remember anything about the Sahibs?\"",
                "\"It is long ago, but I remember that one Sahib, a fat man and always\n      angry, was playing here one night, and he said to me: -- 'Mangal Khan,\n      brandy-pani do,' and I filled the glass, and he bent over the table to\n      strike, and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table, and his\n      spectacles came off, and when we -- the Sahibs and I myself -- ran\n      to lift him he was dead. I helped to carry him out. Aha, he was a strong\n      Sahib! But he is dead and I, old Mangal Khan, am still living, by your\n      favor.\"",
                "That was more than enough! I had my ghost -- a firsthand, authenticated\n      article. I would write to the Society for Psychical Research -- I would\n      paralyze the Empire with the news! But I would, first of all, put eighty\n      miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dak-bungalow before\n      nightfall. The Society might send their regular agent to investigate later\n      on.",
                "I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts\n      of the case. As I smoked I heard the game begin again, -- with a miss\n      in balk this time, for the whir was a short one.",
                "The door was open and I could see into the room. Click -- click! That\n      was a cannon. I entered the room without fear, for there was sunlight\n      within and a fresh breeze without. The unseen game was going on at a\n      tremendous rate. And well it might, when a restless little rat was running\n      to and fro inside the dingy ceiling-cloth, and a piece of loose\n      window-sash was making fifty breaks off the window-bolt as it shook in the\n      breeze!",
                "Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake\n      the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when I\n      shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast\n      game.",
                "Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows, Kadir Baksh.",
                "\"This bungalow is very bad and low-caste! No wonder the Presence was\n      disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers came to the\n      bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside, and said that it was\n      their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people! What\n      honor has the khansamah? They tried to enter, but I told them to go. No\n      wonder, if these Oorias have been here, that the Presence is sorely\n      spotted. It is shame, and the work of a dirty man!\"",
                "Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for\n      rent in advance, and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten them with the big\n      green umbrella whose use I could never before divine. But Kadir Baksh has\n      no notions of morality.",
                "There was an interview with the khansamah, but as he promptly lost his\n      head, wrath gave place to pity, and pity led to a long conversation, in\n      the course of which he put the fat Engineer-Sahib's tragic death in three\n      separate stations -- two of them fifty miles away. The third shift was\n      to Calcutta, and there the Sahib died while driving a dogcart.",
                "If I had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through\n      Bengal with his corpse.",
                "I did not go away as soon as I intended. I stayed for the night, while the\n      wind and the rat and the sash and the window-bolt played a ding-dong\n      \"hundred and fifty up.\" Then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped,\n      and I felt that I had ruined my one genuine, hall-marked ghost story.",
                "Had I only stopped at the proper time, I could have made anything out of\n      it.",

                "THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES",
                "Alive or dead-there is no other way.\n                -- Native Proverb.",
                "THERE is, as the conjurers say, no deception about this tale. Jukes by\n      accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist, though he is\n      the only Englishman who has been there. A somewhat similar institution\n      used to flourish on the outskirts of Calcutta, and there is a story that\n      if you go into the heart of Bikanir, which is in the heart of the Great\n      Indian Desert, you shall come across not a village but a town where the\n      Dead who did not die but may not live have established their headquarters.\n      And, since it is perfectly true that in the same Desert is a wonderful\n      city where all the rich money lenders retreat after they have made their\n      fortunes (fortunes so vast that the owners cannot trust even the strong\n      hand of the Government to protect them, but take refuge in the waterless\n      sands), and drive sumptuous C-spring barouches, and buy beautiful girls\n      and decorate their palaces with gold and ivory and Minton tiles and\n      mother-of-pearl, I do not see why Jukes's tale should not be true. He is a\n      Civil Engineer, with a head for plans and distances and things of that\n      kind, and he certainly would not take the trouble to invent imaginary\n      traps. He could earn more by doing his legitimate work. He never varies\n      the tale in the telling, and grows very hot and indignant when he thinks\n      of the disrespectful treatment he received. He wrote this quite\n      straightforwardly at first, but he has since touched it up in places and\n      introduced Moral Reflections, thus:",
                "In the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever. My work\n      necessitated my being in camp for some months between Pakpattan and\n      Muharakpur -- a desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has\n      had the misfortune to go there may know. My coolies were neither more nor\n      less exasperating than other gangs, and my work demanded sufficient\n      attention to keep me from moping, had I been inclined to so unmanly a\n      weakness.",
                "On the 23d December, 1884, I felt a little feverish. There was a full moon\n      at the time, and, in consequence, every dog near my tent was baying it.\n      The brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic. A few days\n      previously I had shot one loud-mouthed singer and suspended his carcass in\n      terrorem about fifty yards from my tent-door. But his friends fell upon,\n      fought for, and ultimately devoured the body; and, as it seemed to me,\n      sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed energy.",
                "The light-heartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on\n      different men. My irritation gave way, after a short time, to a fixed\n      determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been\n      foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening. Thanks to a\n      shaking hand and a giddy head I had already missed him twice with both\n      barrels of my shot-gun, when it struck me that my best plan would be to\n      ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hog-spear. This, of\n      course, was merely the semi-delirious notion of a fever patient; but I\n      remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and\n      feasible.",
                "I therefore ordered my groom to saddle Pornic and bring him round quietly\n      to the rear of my tent. When the pony was ready, I stood at his head\n      prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift up his\n      voice. Pornic, by the way, had not been out of his pickets for a couple of\n      days; the night air was crisp and chilly; and I was armed with a specially\n      long and sharp pair of persuaders with which I had been rousing a sluggish\n      cob that afternoon. You will easily believe, then, that when he was let go\n      he went quickly. In one moment, for the brute bolted as straight as a die,\n      the tent was left far behind, and we were flying over the smooth sandy\n      soil at racing speed.",
                "In another we had passed the wretched dog, and I had almost forgotten why\n      it was that I had taken the horse and hogspear.",
                "The delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the air\n      must have taken away the remnant of my senses. I have a faint recollection\n      of standing upright in my stirrups, and of brandishing my hog-spear at the\n      great white Moon that looked down so calmly on my mad gallop; and of\n      shouting challenges to the camel-thorn bushes as they whizzed past. Once\n      or twice I believe, I swayed forward on Pornic's neck, and literally hung\n      on by my spurs -- as the marks next morning showed.",
                "The wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed, over what seemed\n      to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand. Next, I remember, the ground\n      rose suddenly in front of us, and as we topped the ascent I saw the waters\n      of the Sutlej shining like a silver bar below. Then Pornic blundered\n      heavily on his nose, and we rolled together down some unseen slope.",
                "I must have lost consciousness, for when I recovered I was lying on my\n      stomach in a heap of soft white sand, and the dawn was beginning to break\n      dimly over the edge of the slope down which I had fallen. As the light\n      grew stronger I saw that I was at the bottom of a horse-shoe shaped crater\n      of sand, opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the Sutlej. My\n      fever had altogether left me, and, with the exception of a slight\n      dizziness in the head, I felt no had effects from the fall over night.",
                "Pornic, who was standing a few yards away, was naturally a good deal\n      exhausted, but had not hurt himself in the least. His saddle, a favorite\n      polo one, was much knocked about, and had been twisted under his belly. It\n      took me some time to put him to rights, and in the meantime I had ample\n      opportunities of observing the spot into which I had so foolishly dropped.",
                "At the risk of being considered tedious, I must describe it at length:\n      inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of\n      material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows.",
                "Imagine then, as I have said before, a horseshoe-shaped crater of sand\n      with steeply graded sand walls about thirty-five feet high. (The slope, I\n      fancy, must have been about 65 degrees.) This crater enclosed a level\n      piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part,\n      with a crude well in the centre. Round the bottom of the crater, about\n      three feet from the level of the ground proper, ran a series of\n      eighty-three semi-circular ovoid, square, and multilateral holes, all\n      about three feet at the mouth. Each hole on inspection showed that it was\n      carefully shored internally with drift-wood and bamboos, and over the\n      mouth a wooden drip-board projected, like the peak of a jockey's cap, for\n      two feet. No sign of life was visible in these tunnels, but a most\n      sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatre -- a stench fouler\n      than any which my wanderings in Indian villages have introduced me to.",
                "Having remounted Pornic, who was as anxious as I to get back to camp, I\n      rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit\n      would be practicable. The inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not\n      thought fit to put in an appearance, so I was left to my own devices. My\n      first attempt to \"rush\" Pornic up the steep sand-banks showed me that I\n      had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the\n      ant-lion sets for its prey. At each step the shifting sand poured down\n      from above in tons, and rattled on the drip-boards of the holes like small\n      shot. A couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to the\n      bottom, half choked with the torrents of sand; and I was constrained to\n      turn my attention to the river-bank.",
                "Here everything seemed easy enough. The sand hills ran down to the river\n      edge, it is true, but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across\n      which I could gallop Pornic, and find my way back to terra firma by\n      turning sharply to the right or left. As I led Pornic over the sands I was\n      startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river; and at the same\n      moment a bullet dropped with a sharp \"whit\" close to Pornic's head.",
                "There was no mistaking the nature of the missile-a regulation\n      Martini-Henry \"picket.\" About five hundred yards away a country-boat was\n      anchored in midstream; and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in\n      the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come.\n      Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse? The treacherous sand\n      slope allowed no escape from a spot which I had visited most\n      involuntarily, and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for a\n      bombardment from some insane native in a boat. I'm afraid that I lost my\n      temper very much indeed.",
                "Another bullet reminded me that I had better save my breath to cool my\n      porridge; and I retreated hastily up the sands and back to the horseshoe,\n      where I saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixty-five human beings\n      from the badger-holes which I had up till that point supposed to be\n      untenanted. I found myself in the midst of a crowd of spectators -- about\n      forty men, twenty women, and one child who could not have been more than\n      five years old. They were all scantily clothed in that salmon-colored\n      cloth which one associates with Hindu mendicants, and, at first sight,\n      gave me the impression of a band of loathsome fakirs. The filth and\n      repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond all description, and I shuddered\n      to think what their life in the badger-holes must be.",
                "Even in these days, when local self government has destroyed the greater\n      part of a native's respect for a Sahib, I have been accustomed to a\n      certain amount of civility from my inferiors, and on approaching the crowd\n      naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my presence. As\n      a matter of fact there was; but it was by no means what I had looked for.",
                "The ragged crew actually laughed at me -- such laughter I hope I may\n      never hear again. They cackled, yelled, whistled, and howled as I walked\n      into their midst; some of them literally throwing themselves down on the\n      ground in convulsions of unholy mirth. In a moment I had let go Pornic's\n      head, and irritated beyond expression at the morning's adventure,\n      commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force I could. The\n      wretches dropped under my blows like nine-pins, and the laughter gave\n      place to wails for mercy; while those yet untouched clasped me round the\n      knees, imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them.",
                "In the tumult, and just when I was feeling very much ashamed of myself for\n      having thus easily given way to my temper, a thin, high voice murmured in\n      English from behind my shoulder: \" -- Sahib! Sahib! Do you not know me?\n      Sahib, it is Gunga Dass, the telegraph-master.\"",
                "I spun round quickly and faced the speaker.",
                "Gunga Dass, (I have, of course, no hesitation in mentioning the man's real\n      name) I had known four years before as a Deccanee Brahmin loaned by the\n      Punjab Government to one of the Khalsia States. He was in charge of a\n      branch telegraph-office there, and when I had last met him was a jovial,\n      full-stomached, portly Government servant with a marvelous capacity for\n      making had puns in English -- a peculiarity which made me remember him\n      long after I had forgotten his services to me in his official capacity. It\n      is seldom that a Hindu makes English puns.",
                "Now, however, the man was changed beyond all recognition. Caste-mark,\n      stomach, slate-colored continuations, and unctuous speech were all gone. I\n      looked at a withered skeleton, turban-less and almost naked, with long\n      matted hair and deep-set codfish-eyes.",
                "But for a crescent-shaped scar on the left cheek -- the result of an\n      accident for which I was responsible I should never have known him. But it\n      was indubitably Gunga Dass, and -- for this I was thankful -- an\n      English-speaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all that\n      I had gone through that day.",
                "The crowd retreated to some distance as I turned toward the miserable\n      figure, and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the crate.\n      He held a freshly plucked crow in his hand, and in reply to my question\n      climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of the holes, and\n      commenced lighting a fire there in silence. Dried bents, sand-poppies, and\n      driftwood burn quickly; and I derived much consolation from the fact that\n      he lit them with an ordinary sulphur-match. When they were in a bright\n      glow, and the crow was neatly spitted in front thereof, Gunga Dass began\n      without a word of preamble:",
                "\"There are only two kinds of men, Sar. The alive and the dead. When you\n      are dead you are dead, but when you are alive you live.\" (Here the crow\n      demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in\n      danger of being burned to a cinder.) \"If you die at home and do not die\n      when you come to the ghat to be burned you come here.\"",
                "The nature of the reeking village was made plain now, and all that I had\n      known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact just\n      communicated by the ex-Brahmin. Sixteen years ago, when I first landed in\n      Bombay, I had been told by a wandering Armenian of the existence,\n      somewhere in India, of a place to which such Hindus as had the misfortune\n      to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and kept, and I\n      recollect laughing heartily at what I was then pleased to consider a\n      traveler's tale.",
                "Sitting at the bottom of the sand-trap, the memory of Watson's Hotel, with\n      its swinging punkahs, white-robed attendants, and the sallow-faced\n      Armenian, rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph, and I burst into\n      a loud fit of laughter. The contrast was too absurd!",
                "Gunga Dass, as he bent over the unclean bird, watched me curiously. Hindus\n      seldom laugh, and his surroundings were not such as to move Gunga Dass to\n      any undue excess of hilarity. He removed the crow solemnly from the wooden\n      spit and as solemnly devoured it. Then he continued his story, which I\n      give in his own words:",
                "\"In epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before\n      you are dead. When you come to the riverside the cold air, perhaps, makes\n      you alive, and then, if you are only little alive, mud is put on your nose\n      and mouth and you die conclusively. If you are rather more alive, more mud\n      is put; but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away. I was\n      too lively, and made protestation with anger against the indignities that\n      they endeavored to press upon me. In those days I was Brahmin and proud\n      man.",
                "\"Now I am dead man and eat\" -- here he eyed the well-gnawed breast bone\n      with the first sign of emotion that I had seen in him since we met -- \"crows,\n      and other things. They took me from my sheets when they saw that I was too\n      lively and gave me medicines for one week, and I survived successfully.\n      Then they sent me by rail from my place to Okara Station, with a man to\n      take care of me; and at Okara Station we met two other men, and they\n      conducted we three on camels, in the night, from Okara Station to this\n      place, and they propelled me from the top to the bottom, and the other two\n      succeeded, and I have been here ever since two and a half years. Once I\n      was Brahmin and proud man, and now I eat crows.\"",
                "\"There is no way of getting out?\"",
                "\"None of what kind at all. When I first came I made experiments frequently\n      and all the others also, but we have always succumbed to the sand which is\n      precipitated upon our heads.\"",
                "\"But surely,\" I broke in at this point, \"the river-front is open, and it\n      is worth while dodging the bullets; while at night\" -- I had already\n      matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness\n      forbade me sharing with Gunga Dass. He, however, divined my unspoken\n      thought almost as soon as it was formed; and, to my intense astonishment,\n      gave vent to a long low chuckle of derision -- the laughter, be it\n      understood, of a superior or at least of an equal.",
                "\"You will not\" -- he had dropped the Sir completely after his opening\n      sentence -- \"make any escape that way. But you can try. I have tried.\n      Once only.\"",
                "The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which I had in vain\n      attempted to strive against overmastered me completely. My long fast -- it\n      was now close upon ten o'clock, and I had eaten nothing since tiffin on\n      the previous day -- combined with the violent and unnatural agitation\n      of the ride had exhausted me, and I verily believe that, for a few\n      minutes, I acted as one mad. I hurled myself against the pitiless\n      sand-slope. I ran round the base of the crater, blaspheming and praying by\n      turns. I crawled out among the sedges of the river-front, only to be\n      driven back each time in an agony of nervous dread by the rifle-bullets\n      which cut up the sand round me -- for I dared not face the death of a\n      mad dog among that hideous crowd -- and finally fell, spent and raving,\n      at the curb of the well. No one had taken the slightest notion of an\n      exhibition which makes me blush hotly even when I think of it now.",
                "Two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water, but they were\n      evidently used to this sort of thing, and had no time to waste upon me.\n      The situation was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had banked the\n      embers of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half a cupful of\n      fetid water over my head, an attention for which I could have fallen on my\n      knees and thanked him, but he was laughing all the while in the same\n      mirthless, wheezy key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the\n      shoals. And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I lay till noon.",
                "Then, being only a man after all, I felt hungry, and intimated as much to\n      Gunga Dass, whom I had begun to regard as my natural protector. Following\n      the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives, I put my hand\n      into my pocket and drew out four annas. The absurdity of the gift struck\n      me at once, and I was about to replace the money.",
                "Gunga Dass, however, was of a different opinion. \"Give me the money,\" said\n      he; \"all you have, or I will get help, and we will kill you!\" All this as\n      if it were the most natural thing in the world!",
                "A Briton's first impulse, I believe, is to guard the contents of his\n      pockets; but a moment's reflection convinced me of the futility of\n      differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me comfortable;\n      and with whose help it was possible that I might eventually escape from\n      the crater. I gave him all the money in my possession, Rs. 9-8-5 -- nine\n      rupees eight annas and five pie -- for I always keep small change as\n      bakshish when I am in camp. Gunga Dass clutched the coins, and hid them at\n      once in his ragged loin cloth, his expression changing to something\n      diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one had observed\n      us.",
                "\"Now I will give you something to eat,\" said he.",
                "What pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him I am\n      unable to say; but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight I was not\n      sorry that I had parted with it so readily, for I had no doubt that he\n      would have had me killed if I had refused. One does not protest against\n      the vagaries of a den of wild beasts; and my companions were lower than\n      any beasts. While I devoured what Gunga Dass had provided, a coarse\n      chapatti and a cupful of the foul well-water, the people showed not the\n      faintest sign of curiosity -- that curiosity which is so rampant, as a\n      rule, in an Indian village.",
                "I could even fancy that they despised me. At all events they treated me\n      with the most chilling indifference, and Gunga Dass was nearly as bad. I\n      plied him with questions about the terrible village, and received\n      extremely unsatisfactory answers. So far as I could gather, it had been in\n      existence from time immemorial -- whence I concluded that it was at\n      least a century old -- and during that time no one had ever been known\n      to escape from it. [I had to control myself here with both hands, lest the\n      blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving round\n      the crater.] Gunga Dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing this\n      point and in watching me wince. Nothing that I could do would induce him\n      to tell me who the mysterious \"They\" were.",
                "\"It is so ordered,\" he would reply, \"and I do not yet know any one who has\n      disobeyed the orders.\"",
                "\"Only wait till my servants find that I am missing,\" I retorted, \"and I\n      promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth,\n      and I'll give you a lesson in civility, too, my friend.\"",
                "\"Your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place;\n      and, besides, you are dead, my dear friend. It is not your fault, of\n      course, but none the less you are dead and buried.\"",
                "At irregular intervals supplies of food, I was told, were dropped down\n      from the land side into the amphitheatre, and the inhabitants fought for\n      them like wild beasts. When a man felt his death coming on he retreated to\n      his lair and died there. The body was sometimes dragged out of the hole\n      and thrown on to the sand, or allowed to rot where it lay.",
                "The phrase \"thrown on to the sand\" caught my attention, and I asked Gunga\n      Dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a pestilence.",
                "\"That,\" said he, with another of his wheezy chuckles, \"you may see for\n      yourself subsequently. You will have much time to make observations.\"",
                "Whereat, to his great delight, I winced once more and hastily continued\n      the conversation: -- \"And how do you live here from day to day? What do\n      you do?\" The question elicited exactly the same answer as before coupled\n      with the information that \"this place is like your European heaven; there\n      is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.\"",
                "Gunga Dass had been educated at a Mission School, and, as he himself\n      admitted, had he only changed his religion \"like a wise man,\" might have\n      avoided the living grave which was now his portion. But as long as I was\n      with him I fancy he was happy.",
                "Here was a Sahib, a representative of the dominant race, helpless as a\n      child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors. In a deliberate\n      lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would devote a\n      rapturous half-hour to watching the agonies of an impaled beetle, or as a\n      ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably to the neck of a\n      rabbit. The burden of his conversation was that there was no escape \"of no\n      kind whatever,\" and that I should stay here till I died and was \"thrown on\n      to the sand.\" If it were possible to forejudge the conversation of the\n      Damned on the advent of a new soul in their abode, I should say that they\n      would speak as Gunga Dass did to me throughout that long afternoon. I was\n      powerless to protest or answer; all my energies being devoted to a\n      struggle against the inexplicable terror that threatened to overwhelm me\n      again and again. I can compare the feeling to nothing except the struggles\n      of a man against the overpowering nausea of the Channel passage -- only\n      my agony was of the spirit and infinitely more terrible.",
                "As the day wore on, the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to\n      catch the rays of the afternoon sun, which were now sloping in at the\n      mouth of the crater. They assembled in little knots, and talked among\n      themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction. About four\n      o'clock, as far as I could judge Gunga Dass rose and dived into his lair\n      for a moment, emerging with a live crow in his hands. The wretched bird\n      was in a most draggled and deplorable condition, but seemed to be in no\n      way afraid of its master, Advancing cautiously to the river front, Gunga\n      Dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch\n      of sand directly in the line of the boat's fire. The occupants of the boat\n      took no notice. Here he stopped, and, with a couple of dexterous turns of\n      the wrist, pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings. As was\n      only natural, the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air with its\n      claws. In a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention of a bevy\n      of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away, where they were\n      discussing something that looked like a corpse. Half a dozen crows flew\n      over at once to see what was going on, and also, as it proved, to attack\n      the pinioned bird. Gunga Dass, who had lain down on a tussock, motioned to\n      me to be quiet, though I fancy this was a needless precaution. In a\n      moment, and before I could see how it happened, a wild crow, who had\n      grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird, was entangled in the\n      latter's claws, swiftly disengaged by Gunga Dass, and pegged down beside\n      its companion in adversity. Curiosity, it seemed, overpowered the rest of\n      the flock, and almost before Gunga Dass and I had time to withdraw to the\n      tussock, two more captives were struggling in the upturned claws of the\n      decoys. So the chase -- if I can give it so dignified a name -- continued\n      until Gunga Dass had captured seven crows. Five of them he throttled at\n      once, reserving two for further operations another day. I was a good deal\n      impressed by this, to me, novel method of securing food, and complimented\n      Gunga Dass on his skill.",
                "\"It is nothing to do,\" said he. \"Tomorrow you must do it for me. You are\n      stronger than I am.\"",
                "This calm assumption of superiority Upset me not a little, and I answered\n      peremptorily; -- \"Indeed, you old ruffian! What do you think I have\n      given you money for?\"",
                "\"Very well,\" was the unmoved reply. \"Perhaps not tomorrow, nor the day\n      after, nor subsequently; but in the end, and for many years, you will\n      catch crows and eat crows, and you will thank your European God that you\n      have crows to catch and eat.\"",
                "I could have cheerfully strangled him for this; but judged it best under\n      the circumstances to smother my resentment. An hour later I was eating one\n      of the crows; and, as Gunga Dass had said, thanking my God that I had a\n      crow to eat. Never as long as I live shall I forget that evening meal. The\n      whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform opposite their\n      dens, huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes. Death, having\n      once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike, seemed to stand\n      aloof from them now; for most of our company were old men, bent and worn\n      and twisted with years, and women aged to all appearance as the Fates\n      themselves. They sat together in knots and talked -- God only knows\n      what they found to discuss -- in low equable tones, curiously in\n      contrast to the strident babble with which natives are accustomed to make\n      day hideous. Now and then an access of that sudden fury which had\n      possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or woman; and with\n      yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the steep slope until,\n      baffled and bleeding, he fell back on the platform incapable of moving a\n      limb. The others would never even raise their eyes when this happened, as\n      men too well aware of the futility of their fellows' attempts and wearied\n      with their useless repetition. I saw four such outbursts in the course of\n      the evening.",
                "Gunga Dass took an eminently business-like view of my situation, and while\n      we were dining -- I can afford to laugh at the recollection now, but it\n      was painful enough at the time-propounded the terms on which he would\n      consent to \"do\" for me. My nine rupees eight annas, he argued, at the rate\n      of three annas a day, would provide me with food for fifty-one days, or\n      about seven weeks; that is to say, he would be willing to cater for me for\n      that length of time. At the end of it I was to look after myself. For a\n      further consideration -- videlicet my boots -- he would be willing\n      to allow me to occupy the den next to his own, and would supply me with as\n      much dried grass for bedding as he could spare.",
                "\"Very well, Gunga Dass,\" I replied; \"to the first terms I cheerfully\n      agree, but, as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as you\n      sit here and taking everything that you have\" (I thought of the two\n      invaluable crows at the time), \"I flatly refuse to give you my boots and\n      shall take whichever den I please.\"",
                "The stroke was a bold one, and I was glad when I saw that it had\n      succeeded. Gunga Dass changed his tone immediately, and disavowed all\n      intention of asking for my boots. At the time it did not strike me as at\n      all strange that I, a Civil Engineer, a man of thirteen years' standing in\n      the Service, and, I trust, an average Englishman, should thus calmly\n      threaten murder and violence against the man who had, for a consideration\n      it is true, taken me under his wing. I had left the world, it seemed, for\n      centuries. I was as certain then as I am now of my own existence, that in\n      the accursed settlement there was no law save that of the strongest; that\n      the living dead men had thrown behind them every canon of the world which\n      had cast them out; and that I had to depend for my own life on my strength\n      and vigilance alone. The crew of the ill-fated Mignonette are the only men\n      who would understand my frame of mind. \"At present,\" I argued to myself,\n      \"I am strong and a match for six of these wretches. It is imperatively\n      necessary that I should, for my own sake, keep both health and strength\n      until the hour of my release comes -- if it ever does.\"",
                "Fortified with these resolutions, I ate and drank as much as I could, and\n      made Gunga Dass understand that I intended to be his master, and that the\n      least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with the only\n      punishment I had it in my power to inflict -- sudden and violent death.\n      Shortly after this I went to bed.",
                "That is to say, Gunga Dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which I\n      thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his, and followed\n      myself, feet foremost; the hole running about nine feet into the sand with\n      a slight downward inclination, and being neatly shored with timbers. From\n      my den, which faced the river-front, I was able to watch the waters of the\n      Sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to\n      sleep as best I might.",
                "The horrors of that night I shall never forget. My den was nearly as\n      narrow as a coffin, and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by the\n      contact of innumerable naked bodies, added to which it smelled abominably.\n      Sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited frame of mind.\n      As the night wore on, it seemed that the entire amphitheatre was filled\n      with legions of unclean devils that, trooping up from the shoals below,\n      mocked the unfortunates in their lairs.",
                "Personally I am not of an imaginative temperament, -- very few\n      Engineers are, -- but on that occasion I was as completely prostrated\n      with nervous terror as any woman. After half an hour or so, however, I was\n      able once more to calmly review my chances of escape. Any exit by the\n      steep sand walls was, of course, impracticable. I had been thoroughly\n      convinced of this some time before. It was possible, just possible, that I\n      might, in the uncertain moonlight, safely run the gauntlet of the rifle\n      shots. The place was so full of terror for me that I was prepared to\n      undergo any risk in leaving it. Imagine my delight, then, when after\n      creeping stealthily to the river-front I found that the infernal boat was\n      not there. My freedom lay before me in the next few steps!",
                "By walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the\n      projecting left horn of the horseshoe, I could wade across, turn the flank\n      of the crater, and make my way inland. Without a moment's hesitation I\n      marched briskly past the tussocks where Gunga Dass had snared the crows,\n      and out in the direction of the smooth white sand beyond. My first step\n      from the tufts of dried grass showed me how utterly futile was any hope of\n      escape; for, as I put my foot down, I felt an indescribable drawing,\n      sucking motion of the sand below. Another moment and my leg was swallowed\n      up nearly to the knee. In the moonlight the whole surface of the sand\n      seemed to be shaken with devilish delight at my disappointment. I\n      struggled clear, sweating with terror and exertion, back to the tussocks\n      behind me and fell on my face.",
                "My only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a\n      quicksand!",
                "How long I lay I have not the faintest idea; but I was roused at last by\n      the malevolent chuckle of Gunga Dass at my ear. \"I would advise you,\n      Protector of the Poor\" (the ruffian was speaking English) \"to return to\n      your house. It is unhealthy to lie down here. Moreover, when the boat\n      returns, you will most certainly be rifled at.\" He stood over me in the\n      dim light of the dawn, chuckling and laughing to himself. Suppressing my\n      first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the\n      quicksand, I rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the\n      burrows.",
                "Suddenly, and futilely as I thought while I spoke, I asked -- \"Gunga\n      Dass, what is the good of the boat if I can't get out anyhow?\" I recollect\n      that even in my deepest trouble I had been speculating vaguely on the\n      waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore.",
                "Gunga Dass laughed again and made answer: -- \"They have the boat only\n      in daytime. It is for the reason that there is a way. I hope we shall have\n      the pleasure of your company for much longer time. It is a pleasant spot\n      when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough.\"",
                "I staggered, numbed and helpless, toward the fetid burrow allotted to me,\n      and fell asleep. An hour or so later I was awakened by a piercing scream -- the\n      shrill, high-pitched scream of a horse in pain. Those who have once heard\n      that will never forget the sound. I found some little difficulty in\n      scrambling out of the burrow. When I was in the open, I saw Pornic, my\n      poor old Pornic, lying dead on the sandy soil. How they had killed him I\n      cannot guess. Gunga Dass explained that horse was better than crow, and\n      \"greatest good of greatest number is political maxim. We are now Republic,\n      Mister Jukes, and you are entitled to a fair share of the beast. If you\n      like, we will pass a vote of thanks. Shall I propose?\"",
                "Yes, we were a Republic indeed! A Republic of wild beasts penned at the\n      bottom of a pit, to eat and fight and sleep till we died. I attempted no\n      protest of any kind, but sat down and stared at the hideous sight in front\n      of me. In less time almost than it takes me to write this, Pornic's body\n      was divided, in some unclear way or other; the men and women had dragged\n      the fragments on to the platform and were preparing their normal meal.\n      Gunga Dass cooked mine. The almost irresistible impulse to fly at the sand\n      walls until I was wearied laid hold of me afresh, and I had to struggle\n      against it with all my might. Gunga Dass was offensively jocular till I\n      told him that if he addressed another remark of any kind whatever to me I\n      should strangle him where he sat. This silenced him till silence became\n      insupportable, and I bade him say something.",
                "\"You will live here till you die like the other Feringhi,\" he said,\n      coolly, watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing.",
                "\"What other Sahib, you swine? Speak at once, and don't stop to tell me a\n      lie.\"",
                "\"He is over there,\" answered Gunga Dass, pointing to a burrow-mouth about\n      four doors ta the left of my own. \"You can see for yourself. He died in\n      the burrow as you will die, and I will die, and as all these men and women\n      and the one child will also die.\"",
                "\"For pity's sake tell me all you know about him. Who was he? When did he\n      come, and when did he die?\"",
                "This appeal was a weak step on my part. Gunga Dass only leered and\n      replied: -- \"I will not -- unless you give me something first.\"",
                "Then I recollected where I was, and struck the man between the eyes,\n      partially stunning him. He stepped down from the platform at once, and,\n      cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet, led me\n      round to the burrow which he had indicated.",
                "\"I know nothing whatever about the gentleman. Your God be my witness that\n      I do not. He was as anxious to escape as you were, and he was shot from\n      the boat, though we all did all things to prevent him from attempting. He\n      was shot here.\" Gunga Dass laid his hand on his lean stomach and bowed to\n      the earth.",
                "\"Well, and what then? Go on!\"",
                "\"And then -- and then, Your Honor, we carried him in to his house and\n      gave him water, and put wet cloths on the wound, and he laid down in his\n      house and gave up the ghost.\"",
                "\"In how long? In how long?\"",
                "\"About half an hour, after he received his wound. I call Vishnu to\n      witness,\" yelled the wretched man, \"that I did everything for him.\n      Everything which was possible, that I did!\"",
                "He threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles. But I had my\n      doubts about Gunga Dass's benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay\n      protesting.",
                "\"I believe you robbed him of everything he had. But I can find out in a\n      minute or two. How long was the Sahib here?\"",
                "\"Nearly a year and a half. I think he must have gone mad. But hear me\n      swear, Protector of the Poor! Won't Your Honor hear me swear that I never\n      touched an article that belonged to him? What is Your Worship going to\n      do?\"",
                "I had taken Gunga Dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the platform\n      opposite the deserted burrow. As I did so I thought of my wretched\n      fellow-prisoner's unspeakable misery among all these horrors for eighteen\n      months, and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole, with a\n      bullet-wound in the stomach. Gunga Dass fancied I was going to kill him\n      and howled pitifully. The rest of the population, in the plethora that\n      follows a full flesh meal, watched us without stirring.",
                "\"Go inside, Gunga Dass,\" said I, \"and fetch it out.\"",
                "I was feeling sick and faint with horror now. Gunga Dass nearly rolled off\n      the platform and howled aloud.",
                "\"But I am Brahmin, Sahib -- a high-caste Brahmin. By your soul, by your\n      father's soul, do not make me do this thing!\"",
                "\"Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my soul and my father's soul, in you go!\" I\n      said, and, seizing him by the shoulders, I crammed his head into the mouth\n      of the burrow, kicked the rest of him in, and, sitting down, covered my\n      face with my hands.",
                "At the end of a few minutes I heard a rustle and a creak; then Gunga Dass\n      in a sobbing, choking whisper speaking to himself; then a soft thud -- and\n      I uncovered my eyes.",
                "The dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a\n      yellow-brown mummy. I told Gunga Dass to stand off while I examined it.",
                "The body -- clad in an olive-green hunting-suit much stained and worn,\n      with leather pads on the shoulders -- was that of a man between thirty\n      and forty, above middle height, with light, sandy hair, long mustache, and\n      a rough unkempt beard. The left canine of the upper jaw was missing, and a\n      portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone. On the second finger of the\n      left hand was a ring -- a shield-shaped bloodstone set in gold, with a\n      monogram that might have been either \"B.K.\" or \"B.L.\" On the third finger\n      of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled cobra, much\n      worn and tarnished. Gunga Dass deposited a handful of trifles he had\n      picked out of the burrow at my feet, and, covering the face of the body\n      with my handkerchief, I turned to examine these. I give the full list in\n      the hope that it may lead to the identification of the unfortunate man:",

Singleton,\n      abbreviated several times to \"Lot Single,\" \"Mrs. S. May,\" and \"Garmison,\"\n       referred to in places as \"Jerry\" or \"Jack.\"",
                "6. Handle of small-sized hunting-knife. Blade snapped short. Buck's horn,\n      diamond cut, with swivel and ring on the butt; fragment of cotton cord\n      attached.",
                "It must not be supposed that I inventoried all these things on the spot as\n      fully as I have here written them down. The notebook first attracted my\n      attention, and I put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later on.",
                "The rest of the articles I conveyed to my burrow for safety's sake, and\n      there being a methodical man, I inventoried them. I then returned to the\n      corpse and ordered Gunga Dass to help me to carry it out to the\n      river-front. While we were engaged in this, the exploded shell of an old\n      brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet.\n      Gunga Dass had not seen it; and I fell to thinking that a man does not\n      carry exploded cartridge-cases, especially \"browns,\" which will not bear\n      loading twice, about with him when shooting. In other words, that\n      cartridge-case had been fired inside the crater. Consequently there must\n      be a gun somewhere. I was on the verge of asking Gunga Dass, but checked\n      myself, knowing that he would lie. We laid the body down on the edge of\n      the quicksand by the tussocks. It was my intention to push it out and let\n      it be swallowed up -- the only possible mode of burial that I could\n      think of. I ordered Gunga Dass to go away.",
                "Then I gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand. In doing so -- it\n      was lying face downward -- I tore the frail and rotten khaki\n      shooting-coat open, disclosing a hideous cavity in the back. I have\n      already told you that the dry sand had, as it were, mummified the body. A\n      moment's glance showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gun-shot\n      wound; the gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the\n      back. The shooting-coat, being intact, had been drawn over the body after\n      death, which must have been instantaneous. The secret of the poor wretch's\n      death was plain to me in a flash. Some one of the crater, presumably Gunga\n      Dass, must have shot him with his own gun -- the gun that fitted the\n      brown cartridges. He had never attempted to escape in the face of the\n      rifle-fire from the boat.",
                "I pushed the corpse out hastily, and saw it sink from sight literally in a\n      few seconds. I shuddered as I watched. In a dazed, half-conscious way I\n      turned to peruse the notebook. A stained and discolored slip of paper bad\n      been inserted between the binding and the back, and dropped out as I\n      opened the pages. This is what it contained: -- \"Four out from\n      crow-clump: three left; nine out; two right; three back; two left;\n      fourteen out; two left; seven out; one left; nine back; two right; six\n      back; four right; seven back.\" The paper had been burned and charred at\n      the edges. What it meant I could not understand. I sat down on the dried\n      bents turning it over and over between my fingers, until I was aware of\n      Gunga Dass standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and\n      outstretched hands.",
                "\"Have you got it?\" he panted. \"Will you not let me look at it also? I\n      swear that I will return it.\"",
                "\"Got what? Return what?\" asked.",
                "\"That which you have in your hands. It will help us both.\" He stretched\n      out his long, bird-like talons, trembling with eagerness.",
                "\"I could never find it,\" he continued. \"He had secreted it about his\n      person. Therefore I shot him, but nevertheless I was unable to obtain it.\"",
                "Gunga Dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the rifle-bullet.\n      I received the information perfectly calmly. Morality is blunted by\n      consorting with the Dead who are alive.",
                "\"What on earth are you raving about? What is it you want me to give you?\"",
                "\"The piece of paper in the notebook. It will help us both. Oh, you fool!\n      You fool! Can you not see what it will do for us? We shall escape!\"",
                "His voice rose almost to a scream, and he danced with excitement before\n      me. I own I was moved at the chance of my getting away.",
                "\"Don't skip! Explain yourself. Do you mean to say that this slip of paper\n      will help us? What does it mean?\"",
                "\"Read it aloud! Read it aloud! I beg and I pray you to read it aloud.\"",
                "I did so. Gunga Dass listened delightedly, and drew an irregular line in\n      the sand with his fingers.",
                "\"See now! It was the length of his gun-barrels without the stock. I have\n      those barrels. Four gun-barrels out from the place where I caught crows\n      straight out; do you follow me? Then three left -- Ah! how well I\n      remember when that man worked it out night after night Then nine out, and\n      so on. Out is always straight before you across the quicksand. He told me\n      so before I killed him.\"",
                "\"But if you knew all this why didn't you get out before?\"",
                "\"I did not know it. He told me that he was working it out a year and a\n      half ago, and how he was working it out night after night when the boat\n      had gone away, and he could get out near the quicksand safely. Then he\n      said that we would get away together. But I was afraid that he would leave\n      me behind one night when he had worked it all out, and so I shot him.\n      Besides, it is not advisable that the men who once get in here should\n      escape. Only I, and I am a Brahmin.\"",
                "The prospect of escape had brought Gunga Dass's caste back to him. He\n      stood up, walked about and gesticulated violently. Eventually I managed to\n      make him talk soberly, and he told me how this Englishman had spent six\n      months night after night in exploring, inch by inch, the passage across\n      the quicksand; how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up to within\n      about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank of the left\n      horn of the horseshoe. This much he had evidently not completed when Gunga\n      Dass shot him with his own gun.",
                "In my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape I recollect shaking\n      hands effusively with Gunga Dass, after we had decided that we were to\n      make an attempt to get away that very night. It was weary work waiting\n      throughout the afternoon.",
                "About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge, when the Moon had just risen\n      above the lip of the crater, Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to\n      bring out the gun-barrels whereby to measure our path. All the other\n      wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago. The guardian\n      boat drifted downstream some hours before, and we were utterly alone by\n      the crow-clump. Gunga Dass, while carrying the gun-barrels, let slip the\n      piece of paper which was to be our guide. I stooped down hastily to\n      recover it, and, as I did so, I was aware that the diabolical Brahmin was\n      aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gun-barrels. It was\n      too late to turn round. I must have received the blow somewhere on the\n      nape of my neck. A hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my eyes, and\n      I fell forwards senseless at the edge of, the quicksand.",
                "When I recovered consciousness, the Moon was going down, and I was\n      sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head. Gunga Dass had\n      disappeared and my mouth was full of blood. I lay down again and prayed\n      that I might die without more ado. Then the unreasoning fury which I had\n      before mentioned, laid hold upon me, and I staggered inland toward the\n      walls of the crater. It seemed that some one was calling to me in a\n      whisper -- \"Sahib! Sahib! Sahib!\" exactly as my bearer used to call me\n      in the morning I fancied that I was delirious until a handful of sand fell\n      at my feet. Then I looked up and saw a head peering down into the\n      amphitheatre -- the head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who attended to my\n      collies. As soon as he had attracted my attention, he held up his hand and\n      showed a rope. I motioned, staggering to and fro for the while, that he\n      should throw it down. It was a couple of leather punkah-ropes knotted\n      together, with a loop at one end. I slipped the loop over my head and\n      under my arms; heard Dunnoo urge something forward; was conscious that I\n      was being dragged, face downward, up the steep sand slope, and the next\n      instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand hills\n      overlooking the crater. Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the moonlight,\n      implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once.",
                "It seems that he had tracked Pornic's footprints fourteen miles across the\n      sands to the crater; had returned and told my servants, who flatly refused\n      to meddle with any one, white or black, once fallen into the hideous\n      Village of the Dead; whereupon Dunnoo had taken one of my ponies and a\n      couple of punkah-ropes, returned to the crater, and hauled me out as I\n      have described.",
                "To cut a long story short, Dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold\n      mohur a month -- a sum which I still think far too little for the\n      services he has rendered. Nothing on earth will induce me to go near that\n      devilish spot again, or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than I have\n      done. Of Gunga Dass I have never found a trace, nor do I wish to do. My\n      sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some one may\n      possibly identify, from the details and the inventory which I have given\n      above, the corpse of the man in the olive-green hunting-suit."

                "The Law, as quoted, lays down a fair conduct of life, and one not easy to\n      follow. I have been fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstances\n      which prevented either of us finding out whether the other was worthy. I\n      have still to be brother to a Prince, though I once came near to kinship\n      with what might have been a veritable King, and was promised the reversion\n      of a Kingdom -- army, law-courts, revenue, and policy all complete.\n      But, today, I greatly fear that my King is dead, and if I want a crown I\n      must go hunt it for myself.",
                "The beginning of everything was in a railway-train upon the road to Mhow\n      from Ajmir. There had been a Deficit in the Budget, which necessitated\n      travelling, not Second-class, which is only half as dear as First-Class,\n      but by Intermediate, which is very awful indeed. There are no cushions in\n      the Intermediate class, and the population are either Intermediate, which\n      is Eurasian, or native, which for a long night journey is nasty, or\n      Loafer, which is amusing though intoxicated. Intermediates do not buy from\n      refreshment-rooms. They carry their food in bundles and pots, and buy\n      sweets from the native sweetmeat-sellers, and drink the roadside water.\n      This is why in hot weather Intermediates are taken out of the carriages\n      dead, and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon.",
                "My particular Intermediate happened to be empty till I reached Nasirabad,\n      when the big black-browed gentleman in shirt-sleeves entered, and,\n      following the custom of Intermediates, passed the time of day. He was a\n      wanderer and a vagabond like myself, but with an educated taste for\n      whisky. He told tales of things he had seen and done, of out-of-the-way\n      corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated, and of adventures in\n      which he risked his life for a few days' food.",
                "\"If India was filled with men like you and me, not knowing more than the\n      crows where they'd get their next day's rations, it isn't seventy millions\n      of revenue the land would be paying -- it's seven hundred millions,\"\n       said he; and as I looked at his mouth and chin I was disposed to agree\n      with him.",
                "We talked politics, -- the politics of Loaferdom that sees things from\n      the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed off, -- and\n      we talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram\n      back from the next station to Ajmir, the turning-off place from the Bombay\n      to the Mhow line as you travel westward. My friend had no money beyond\n      eight annas which he wanted for dinner, and I had no money at all, owing\n      to the hitch in the Budget before mentioned. Further, I was going into a\n      wilderness where, though I should resume touch with the Treasury, there\n      were no telegraph offices. I was, therefore, unable to help him in any\n      way.",
                "\"We might threaten a Station-master, and make him send a wire on tick,\"\n       said my friend, \"but that'd mean inquiries for you and for me, and I've\n      got my hands full these days. Did you say you were travelling back along\n      this line within any days?\"",
                "\"Within ten,\" I said.",

                "\"I can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you,\" I\n      said.",
                "\"I couldn't trust the wire to fetch him, now I think of it. It's this way.\n      He leaves Delhi on the 23rd for Bombay. That means he'll be running\n      through Ajmir about the night of the 23rd.\"",
                "\"But I'm going into the Indian Desert,\" I explained.",
                "\"Well and good,\" said he. \"You'll be changing at Marwar Junction to get\n      into Jodhpore territory, -- you must do that, -- and he'll be coming\n      through Marwar Junction in the early morning of the 24th by the Bombay\n      Mail. Can you be at Marwar Junction on that time? 'T won't be\n      inconveniencing you, because I know that there's precious few pickings to\n      be got out of these Central India States -- even though you pretend to\n      be correspondent of the 'Backwoodsman.'\"",

I would take it more than\n      kind of you if you was to come out of Central India in time to catch him\n      at Marwar Junction, and say to him, 'He has gone South for the week.'\n      He'll know what that means. He's a big man with a red beard, and a great\n      swell he is.",
                "\"You'll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him\n      in a Second-class apartment. But don't you be afraid.",

                "\"Where have you come from?\" said I.",

                "Englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their\n      mothers; but for certain reasons, which will be fully apparent, I saw fit\n      to agree.",
                "\"It's more than a little matter,\" said he, \"and that's why I asked you to\n      do it -- and now I know that I can depend on you doing it. A\n      Second-class carriage at Marwar Junction, and a red-haired man asleep in\n      it. You'll be sure to remember.

                "\"I'll give the message if I catch him,\" I said, \"and for the sake of your\n      Mother as well as mine I'll give you a word of advice. Don't try to run\n      the Central India States just now as the correspondent of the\n      'Backwoodsman.' There's a real one knocking about here, and it might lead\n      to trouble.\"",
                "\"Thank you,\" said he, simply; \"and when will the swine be gone? I can't\n      starve because he's ruining my work. I wanted to get hold of the Degumber\n      Rajah down here about his father's widow, and give him a jump.\"",

                "\"Filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung from\n      a beam. I found that out myself, and I'm the only man that would dare\n      going into the State to get hush-money for it. They'll try to poison me,\n      same as they did in Chortumna when I went on the loot there. But you'll\n      give the man at Marwar Junction my message?\"",
                "He got out at a little roadside station, and I reflected. I had heard,\n      more than once, of men personating correspondents of newspapers and\n      bleeding small Native States with threats of exposure, but I had never met\n      any of the caste before. They lead a hard life, and generally die with\n      great suddenness. The Native States have a wholesome horror of English\n      newspapers, which may throw light on their peculiar methods of government,\n      and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne, or drive them\n      out of their mind with four-in-hand barouches. They do not understand that\n      nobody cares a straw for the internal administration of Native States so\n      long as oppression and crime are kept within decent limits, and the ruler\n      is not drugged, drunk, or diseased from one end of the year to the other.\n      They are the dark places of the earth, full of unimaginable cruelty,\n      touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one side, and, on the other, the\n      days of Harun-al-Raschid. When I left the train I did business with divers\n      Kings, and in eight days passed through many changes of life. Sometimes I\n      wore dress-clothes and consorted with Princes and Politicals, drinking\n      from crystal and eating from silver. Sometimes I lay out upon the ground\n      and devoured what I could get, from a plate made of leaves, and drank the\n      running water, and slept under the same rug as my servant. It was all in\n      the day's work.",
                "Then I headed for the Great Indian Desert upon the proper date, as I had\n      promised, and the night Mail set me down at Marwar Junction, where a funny\n      little, happy-go-lucky, native managed railway runs to Jodhpore. The\n      Bombay Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar. She arrived just as I\n      got in, and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the\n      carriages. There was only one Second-class on the train. I slipped the\n      window and looked down upon a flaming-red beard, half covered by a\n      railway-rug. That was my man, fast asleep, and I dug him gently in the\n      ribs.",
                "He woke with a grunt, and I saw his face in the light of the lamps.",
                "It was a great and shining face.",
                "\"Tickets again?\" said he.",
                "\"No,\" said I. \"I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week. He has\n      gone South for the week!\"",
                "The train had begun to move out. The red man rubbed his eyes.",
                "\"He has gone South for the week,\" he repeated. \"Now that's just like his\n      impidence. Did he say that I was to give you anything? 'Cause I won't.\"",
                "\"He didn't,\" I said, and dropped away, and watched the red lights die out\n      in the dark. It was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off the\n      sands. I climbed into my own train -- not an Intermediate carriage this\n      time -- and went to sleep.",
                "If the man with the beard had given me a rupee I should have kept it as a\n      memento of a rather curious affair. But the consciousness of having done\n      my duty was my only reward.",
                "Later on I reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any\n      good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers, and\n      might, if they blackmailed one of the little rat-trap States of Central\n      India or Southern Rajputana, get themselves into serious difficulties. I\n      therefore took some trouble to describe them as accurately as I could\n      remember to people who would be interested in deporting them; and\n      succeeded, so I was later informed, in having them headed back from the\n      Degumber borders.",
                "Then I became respectable, and returned to an office where there were no\n      Kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper. A\n      newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person, to the\n      prejudice of discipline. Zenana-mission ladies arrive, and beg that the\n      Editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian\n      prize-giving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village; Colonels\n      who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the outline of a\n      series of ten, twelve, or twenty-four leading articles on Seniority versus\n      Selection; missionaries wish to know why they have not been permitted to\n      escape from their regular vehicles of abuse, and swear at a brother\n      missionary under special patronage of the editorial We. Stranded\n      theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay for their\n      advertisements, but on their return from New Zealand or Tahiti will do so\n      with interest; inventors of patent punka-pulling machines, carriage\n      couplings, and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with specifications\n      in their pockets and hours at their disposal; tea companies enter and\n      elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens; secretaries of ball\n      committees clamour to have the glories of their last dance more fully\n      described; strange ladies rustle in and say, \"I want a hundred lady's\n      cards printed at once, please,\" which is manifestly part of an Editor's\n      duty; and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the Grand Trunk Road\n      makes it his business to ask for employment as a proof-reader. And, all\n      the time, the telephone-bell is ringing madly, and Kings are being killed\n      on the Continent, and Empires are saying, \"You're another,\" and Mister\n      Gladstone is calling down brimstone upon the British Dominions, and the\n      little black copyboys are whining, \"kaa-pi chay-ha-yeh\" (\"Copy wanted\"),\n      like tired bees, and most of the paper is as blank as Modred's shield.",
                "But that is the amusing part of the year. There are six other months when\n      none ever come to call, and the thermometer walks inch by inch up to the\n      top of the glass, and the office is darkened to just above reading-light,\n      and the press-machines are red-hot to touch, and nobody writes anything\n      but accounts of amusements in the Hill-stations or obituary notices. Then\n      the telephone becomes a tinkling terror, because it tells you of the\n      sudden deaths of men and women that you knew intimately, and the prickly\n      heat covers you with a garment, and you sit down and write: \"A slight\n      increase of sickness is reported from the Khuda Janta Khan District. The\n      outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature, and, thanks to the energetic\n      efforts of the District authorities, is now almost at an end. It is,\n      however, with deep regret we record the death,\" etc.",
                "Then the sickness really breaks out, and the less recording and reporting\n      the better for the peace of the subscribers. But the Empires and the Kings\n      continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before, and the Foreman\n      thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twenty-four\n      hours, and all the people at the Hill-stations in the middle of their\n      amusements say, \"Good gracious! why can't the paper be sparkling? I'm sure\n      there's plenty going on up here.\"",
                "That is the dark half of the moon, and, as the advertisements say, \"must\n      be experienced to be appreciated.\"",
                "It was in that season, and a remarkably evil season, that the paper began\n      running the last issue of the week on Saturday night, which is to say\n      Sunday morning, after the custom of a London paper. This was a great\n      convenience, for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn would\n      lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for half an\n      hour, and in that chill -- you have no idea how cold is 84 degrees on\n      the grass until you begin to pray for it -- a very tired man could get\n      off to sleep ere the heat roused him.",
                "One Saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone.\n      A King or courtier or a courtesan or a Community was going to die or get a\n      new Constitution, or do something that was important on the other side of\n      the world, and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible\n      minute in order to catch the telegram.",
                "It was a pitchy-black night, as stifling as a June night can be, and the\n      loo, the red-hot wind from the westward, was booming among the tinder-dry\n      trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels.",
                "Now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with\n      the flop of a frog, but all our weary world knew that was only pretence.\n      It was a shade cooler in the press-room than the office, so I sat there,\n      while the type ticked and clicked, and the night-jars hooted at the\n      windows, and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their\n      foreheads and called for water. The thing that was keeping us back,\n      whatever it was, would not come off, though the loo dropped and the last\n      type was set, and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat,\n      with its finger on its lip, to wait the event. I drowsed, and wondered\n      whether the telegraph was a blessing, and whether this dying man, or\n      struggling people, might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was\n      causing. There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make\n      tension, but, as the clock-hands crept up to three o'clock and the\n      machines spun their fly-wheels two and three times to see that all was in\n      order, before I said the word that would set them off, I could have\n      shrieked aloud.",
                "Then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little\n      bits. I rose to go away, but two men in white clothes stood in front of\n      me. The first one said, \"It's him!\" The second said, \"So it is!\" And they\n      both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared, and mopped their\n      foreheads. We seed there was a light burning across the road, and we were\n      sleeping in that ditch there for coolness, and I said to my friend here,\n      \"The office is open. Let's come along and speak to him as turned us back\n      from Degumber State,\" said the smaller of the two. He was the man I had\n      met in the Mhow train, and his fellow was the red-bearded man of Marwar\n      Junction. There was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one or the beard of\n      the other.",
                "I was not pleased, because I wished to go to sleep, not to squabble with\n      loafers. \"What do you want?\" I asked.",
                "\"Half an hour's talk with you, cool and comfortable, in the office,\" said\n      the red-bearded man. \"We'd like some drink, -- the Contrack doesn't\n      begin yet, Peachey, so you needn't look, -- but what we really want is\n      advice. We don't want money. We ask you as a favour, because we found out\n      you did us a bad turn about Degumber State.\"",
                "I led from the press-room to the stifling office with the maps on the\n      walls, and the red-haired man rubbed his hands. \"That's something like,\"\n       said he. \"This was the proper shop to come to.",
                "\"Now, Sir, let me introduce you to Brother Peachey Carnehan, that's him,\n      and Brother Daniel Dravot, that is me, and the less said about our\n      professions the better, for we have been most things in our time -- soldier,\n      sailor, compositor, photographer, proof-reader, street-preacher, and\n      correspondents of the 'Backwoodsman' when we thought the paper wanted one.\n      Carnehan is sober, and so am I. Look at us first, and see that's sure. It\n      will save you cutting into my talk. We'll take one of your cigars apiece,\n      and you shall see us light up.\"",
                "I watched the test. The men were absolutely sober, so I gave them each a\n      tepid whisky-and-soda.",
                "\"Well and good,\" said Carnehan of the eyebrows, wiping the froth from his\n      moustache. \"Let me talk now, Dan. We have been all over India, mostly on\n      foot. We have been boiler-fitters, engine-drivers, petty contractors, and\n      all that, and we have decided that India isn't big enough for such as us.\"",
                "They certainly were too big for the office. Dravot's beard seemed to fill\n      half the room and Carnehan's shoulders the other half, as they sat on the\n      big table. Carnehan continued: \"The country isn't half worked out because\n      they that governs it won't let you touch it. They spend all their blessed\n      time in governing it, and you can't lift a spade, nor chip a rock, nor\n      look for oil, nor anything like that, without all the Government saying,\n      'Leave it alone, and let us govern.' Therefore, such as it is, we will let\n      it alone, and go away to some other place where a man isn't crowded and\n      can come to his own. We are not little men, and there is nothing that we\n      are afraid of except Drink, and we have signed a Contrack on that.",
                "\"Therefore we are going away to be Kings.\"",
                "\"Kings in our own right,\" muttered Dravot.",
                "\"Yes, of course,\" I said. \"You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a\n      very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion? Come\n      tomorrow.\"",
                "\"Neither drunk nor sunstruck,\" said Dravot. \"We have slept over the notion\n      half a year, and require to see Books and Atlases, and we have decided\n      that there is only one place now in the world that two strong men can\n      Sar-a-whack. They call it Kafiristan. By my reckoning it's the top\n      right-hand corner of Afghanistan, not more than three hundred miles from\n      Peshawar. They have two and thirty heathen idols there, and we'll be the\n      thirty-third and fourth. It's a mountaineous country, the women of those\n      parts are very beautiful.\"",
                "\"But that is provided against in the Contrack,\" said Carnehan. \"Neither\n      Women nor Liquor, Daniel.\"",
                "\"And that's all we know, except that no one has gone there, and they\n      fight, and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men\n      can always be a King. We shall go to those parts and say to any King we\n      find, 'D' you want to vanquish your foes?' and we will show him how to\n      drill men; for that we know better than anything else. Then we will\n      subvert that King and seize his Throne and establish a Dy-nasty.\"",
                "\"You'll be cut to pieces before you're fifty miles across the Border,\" I\n      said. \"You have to travel through Afghanistan to get to that country. It's\n      one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers, and no Englishman has been\n      through it. The people are utter brutes, and even if you reached them you\n      couldn't do anything.\"",
                "\"That's more like,\" said Carnehan. \"If you could think us a little more\n      mad we would be more pleased. We have come to you to know about this\n      country, to read a book about it, and to be shown maps. We want you to\n      tell us that we are fools and to show us your books.\" He turned to the\n      bookcases.",
                "\"Are you at all in earnest?\" I said.",
                "\"A little,\" said Dravot, sweetly. \"As big a map as you have got, even if\n      it's all blank where Kafiristan is, and any books you've got. We can read,\n      though we aren't very educated.\"",
                "I uncased the big thirty-two-miles-to-the-inch map of India and two\n      smaller Frontier maps, hauled down volume INF-KAN of the \"Encyclopaedia\n      Britannica,\" and the men consulted them.",
                "\"See here!\" said Dravot, his thumb on the map. \"Up to Jagdallak, Peachey\n      and me know the road. We was there with Robert's Army. We'll have to turn\n      off to the right at Jagdallak through Laghmann territory. Then we get\n      among the hills -- fourteen thousand feet -- fifteen thousand -- it\n      will be cold work there, but it don't look very far on the map.\"",
                "I handed him Wood on the \"Sources of the Oxus.\" Carnehan was deep in the\n      \"Encyclopaedia.\"",
                "\"They're a mixed lot,\" said Dravot, reflectively; \"and it won't help us to\n      know the names of their tribes. The more tribes the more they'll fight,\n      and the better for us. From Jagdallak to Ashang. H'mm!\"",
                "\"But all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate as\n      can be,\" I protested. \"No one knows anything about it really. Here's the\n      file of the 'United Services' Institute.' Read what Bellew says.\"",
                "\"Blow Bellew!\" said Carnehan. \"Dan, they're a stinkin' lot of heathens,\n      but this book here says they think they're related to us English.\"",
                "I smoked while the men poured over Raverty, Wood, the maps, and the\n      \"Encyclopaedia.\"",
                "\"There is no use your waiting,\" said Dravot, politely. \"It's about four\n      o'clock now. We'll go before six o'clock if you want to sleep, and we\n      won't steal any of the papers. Don't you sit up. We're two harmless\n      lunatics, and if you come tomorrow evening down to the Serai we'll say\n      goodbye to you.\"",
                "\"You are two fools,\" I answered. \"You'll be turned back at the Frontier or\n      cut up the minute you set foot in Afghanistan. Do you want any money or a\n      recommendation down-country? I can help you to the chance of work next\n      week.\"",
                "\"Next week we shall be hard at work ourselves, thank you,\" said Dravot.\n      \"It isn't so easy being a King as it looks. When we've got our Kingdom in\n      going order we'll let you know, and you can come up and help us govern\n      it.\"",
                "\"Would two lunatics make a Contrack like that?\" said Carnehan, with\n      subdued pride, showing me a greasy half-sheet of notepaper on which was\n      written the following. I copied it, then and there, as a curiosity.",
                "This Contrack between me and you persuing witnesseth in the name of God -- Amen\n      and so forth.",
                "(One) That me and you will settle this matter together; i.e., to be Kings\n      of Kafiristan.",
                "(Two)That you and me will not, while this matter is being settled, look at\n      any Liquor, nor any Woman, black, white, or brown, so as to get mixed up\n      with one or the other harmful.",
                "(Three) That we conduct ourselves with Dignity and Discretion, and if one\n      of us gets into trouble the other will stay by him.",

                "Daniel Dravot.",
                "Both Gentlemen at Large.",
                "\"There was no need for the last article,\" said Carnehan, blushing\n      modestly; \"but it looks regular. Now you know the sort of men that loafers\n      are, -- we are loafers, Dan, until we get out of India, -- and do\n      you think that we would sign a Contrack like that unless we was in\n      earnest? We have kept away from the two things that make life worth\n      having.\"",
                "\"You won't enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this\n      idiotic adventure. Don't set the office on fire,\" I said, \"and go away\n      before nine o'clock.\"",
                "I left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of the\n      \"Contrack.\" \"Be sure to come down to the Serai tomorrow,\" were their\n      parting words.",
                "The Kumharsen Serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the\n      strings of camels and horses from the North load and unload. All the\n      nationalities of Central Asia may be found there, and most of the folk of\n      India proper. Balkh and Bokhara there meet Bengal and Bombay, and try to\n      draw eye-teeth. You can buy ponies, turquoises, Persian pussy-cats,\n      saddle-bags, fat-tailed sheep, and musk in the Kumharsen Serai, and get\n      many strange things for nothing. In the afternoon I went down to see\n      whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there drunk.",
                "A priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me,\n      gravely twisting a child's paper whirligig. Behind him was his servant\n      bending under the load of a crate of mud toys. The two were loading up two\n      camels, and the inhabitants of the Serai watched them with shrieks of\n      laughter.",
                "\"The priest is mad,\" said a horse-dealer to me. \"He is going up to Kabul\n      to sell toys to the Amir. He will either be raised to honour or have his\n      head cut off. He came in here this morning and has been behaving madly\n      ever since.\"",
                "\"The witless are under the protection of God,\" stammered a flat-cheeked\n      Usbeg in broken Hindi. \"They foretell future events.\"",
                "\"Would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up by\n      the Shinwaris almost within shadow of the Pass!\" grunted the Eusufzai\n      agent of a Rajputana trading-house whose goods had been diverted into the\n      hands of other robbers just across the Border, and whose misfortunes were\n      the laughing-stock of the bazaar. \"Ohe', priest, whence come you and\n      whither do you go?\"",
                "\"From Roum have I come,\" shouted the priest, waving his whirligig; \"from\n      Roum, blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea! O thieves,\n      robbers, liars, the blessing of Pir Khan on pigs, dogs, and perjurers! Who\n      will take the Protected of God to the North to sell charms that are never\n      still to the Amir? The camels shall not gall, the sons shall not fall\n      sick, and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away, of the men\n      who give me place in their caravan. Who will assist me to slipper the King\n      of the Roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel? The protection of\n      Pir Khan be upon his labours!\" He spread out the skirts of his gabardine\n      and pirouetted between the lines of tethered horses.",
                "\"There starts a caravan from Peshawar to Kabul in twenty days, Huzrut,\"\n       said the Eusufzai trader. \"My camels go therewith. Do thou also go and\n      bring us good luck.\"",
                "\"I will go even now!\" shouted the priest. \"I will depart upon my winged\n      camels, and be at Peshawar in a day! Ho! Hazar Mir Khan,\" he yelled to his\n      servant, \"drive out the camels, but let me first mount my own.\"",
                "He leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt, and, turning round to me,\n      cried, \"Come thou also, Sahib, a little along the road, and I will sell\n      thee a charm -- an amulet that shall make thee King of Kafiristan.\"",
                "Then the light broke upon me, and I followed the two camels out of the\n      Serai till we reached open road and the priest halted.",
                "\"What d' you think o' that?\" said he in English. \"Carnehan can't talk\n      their patter, so I've made him my servant. He makes a handsome servant.

We'll hitch on to a caravan at Peshawar\n      till we get to Jagdallak, and then we'll see if we can get donkeys for our\n      camels, and strike into Kafiristan. Whirligigs for the Amir, O Lor'! Put\n      your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you feel.\"",
                "I felt the butt of a Martini, and another and another.",
                "\"Twenty of 'em,\" said Dravot, placidly. \"Twenty of 'em and ammunition to\n      correspond, under the whirligigs and the mud dolls.\"",
                "\"Heaven help you if you are caught with those things!\" I said. \"A Martini\n      is worth her weight in silver among the Pathans.\"",
                "\"Fifteen hundred rupees of capital -- every rupee we could beg, borrow,\n      or steal -- are invested on these two camels,\" said Dravot.",
                "\"We won't get caught. We're going through the Khaiber with a regular\n      caravan. Who'd touch a poor mad priest?\"",
                "\"Have you got everything you want?\" I asked, overcome with astonishment.",
                "\"Not yet, but we shall soon. Give us a memento of your kindness, Brother.\n      You did me a service yesterday, and that time in Marwar. Half my Kingdom\n      shall you have, as the saying is.\" I slipped a small charm compass from my\n      watch-chain and handed it up to the priest.",
                "\"Goodbye,\" said Dravot, giving me hand cautiously. \"It's the last time\n      we'll shake hands with an Englishman these many days. Shake hands with\n      him, Carnehan,\" he cried, as the second camel passed me.",
                "Carnehan leaned down and shook hands. Then the camels passed away along\n      the dusty road, and I was left alone to wonder. My eye could detect no\n      failure in the disguises. The scene in the Serai proved that they were\n      complete to the native mind. There was just the chance, therefore, that\n      Carnehan and Dravot would be able to wander through Afghanistan without\n      detection. But, beyond, they would find death -- certain and awful\n      death.",
                "Ten days later a native correspondent, giving me the news of the day from\n      Peshawar, wound up his letter with: \"There has been much laughter here on\n      account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation to sell\n      petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as great charms\n      to H. H. the Amir of Bokhara. He passed through Peshawar and associated\n      himself to the Second Summer caravan that goes to Kabul. The merchants are\n      pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellows\n      bring good fortune.\"",
                "The two, then, were beyond the Border. I would have prayed for them, but\n      that night a real King died in Europe, and demanded an obituary notice.",
                "The wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again.\n      Summer passed and winter thereafter, and came and passed again. The daily\n      paper continued and I with it, and upon the third summer there fell a hot\n      night, a night issue, and a strained waiting for something to be\n      telegraphed from the other side of the world, exactly as had happened\n      before. A few great men had died in the past two years, the machines\n      worked with more clatter, and some of the trees in the office garden were\n      a few feet taller. But that was all the difference.",
                "I passed over to the press-room, and went through just such a scene as I\n      have already described. The nervous tension was stronger than it had been\n      two years before, and I felt the heat more acutely. At three o'clock I\n      cried, \"Print off,\" and turned to go, when there crept to my chair what\n      was left of a man. He was bent into a circle, his head was sunk between\n      his shoulders, and he moved his feet one over the other like a bear. I\n      could hardly see whether he walked or crawled -- this rag-wrapped,\n      whining cripple who addressed me by name, crying that he was come back.\n      \"Can you give me a drink?\" he whimpered. \"For the Lord's sake, give me a\n      drink!\"",
                "I went back to the office, the man following with groans of pain, and I\n      turned up the lamp.",
                "\"Don't you know me?\" he gasped, dropping into a chair, and he turned his\n      drawn face, surmounted by a shock of gray hair, to the light.",
                "I looked at him intently. Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over\n      the nose in an inch-broad black band, but for the life of me I could not\n      tell where.",
                "\"I don't know you,\" I said, handing him the whisky. \"What can I do for\n      you?\"",
                "He took a gulp of the spirit raw, and shivered in spite of the suffocating\n      heat.",
                "\"I've come back,\" he repeated; \"and I was the King of Kafiristan -- me\n      and Dravot -- crowned Kings we was!

                "I was more than a little astonished, and expressed my feelings\n      accordingly.",
                "\"It's true,\" said Carnehan, with a dry cackle, nursing his feet, which\n      were wrapped in rags -- \"true as gospel. Kings we were, with crowns\n      upon our heads -- me and Dravot -- poor Dan -- oh, poor, poor\n      Dan, that would never take advice, not though I begged of him!\"",
                "\"Take the whisky,\" I said, \"and take your own time. Tell me all you can\n      recollect of everything from beginning to end. You got across the Border\n      on your camels, Dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant. Do you\n      remember that?\"",
                "\"I ain't mad -- yet, but I shall be that way soon. Of course I\n      remember. Keep looking at me, or maybe my words will go all to pieces.\n      Keep looking at me in my eyes and don't say anything.\"",
                "I leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as I could. He\n      dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist. It was\n      twisted like a bird's claw, and upon the back was a ragged, red,\n      diamond-shaped scar.",
                "\"No, don't look there. Look at me,\" said Carnehan. \"That comes afterward,\n      but for the Lord's sake don't distrack me. We left with that caravan, me\n      and Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with.\n      Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was\n      cooking their dinners -- cooking their dinners, and... what did they do\n      then? They lit little fires with sparks that went into Dravot's beard, and\n      we all laughed -- fit to die. Little red fires they was, going into\n      Dravot's big red beard -- so funny.\" His eyes left mine and he smiled\n      foolishly.",
                "\"You went as far as Jagdallak with that caravan,\" I said, at a venture,\n      \"after you had lit those fires. To Jagdallak, where you turned off to try\n      to get into Kafiristan.\"",
                "\"No, we didn't, neither. What are you talking about? We turned off before\n      Jagdallak, because we heard the roads was good. But they wasn't good\n      enough for our two camels -- mine and Dravot's. When we left the\n      caravan, Dravot took off all his clothes and mine too, and said we would\n      be heathen, because the Kafirs didn't allow Mohammedans to talk to them.\n      So we dressed betwixt and between, and such a sight as Daniel Dravot I\n      never saw yet nor expect to see again. He burned half his beard, and slung\n      a sheepskin over his shoulder, and shaved his head into patterns. He\n      shaved mine too, and made me wear outrageous things to look like a\n      heathen. That was in a most mountaineous country, and our camels couldn't\n      go along any more because of the mountains. They were tall and black, and\n      coming home I saw them fight like wild goats -- there are lots of goats\n      in Kafiristan. And these mountains, they never keep still, no more than\n      the goats. Always fighting they are, and don't let you sleep at night.\"",
                "\"Take some more whisky,\" I said, very slowly. \"What did you and Daniel\n      Dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads\n      that led into Kafiristan?\"",
                "\"What did which do? There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan\n      that was with Dravot. Shall I tell you about him? He died out there in the\n      cold. Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey, turning and twisting in the\n      air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir. No; they was two\n      for three ha'pence, those whirligigs, or I am much mistaken and woful\n      sore... And then these camels were no use, and Peachey said to Dravot,\n      'For the Lord's sake let's get out of this before our heads are chopped\n      off,' and with that they killed the camels all among the mountains, not\n      having anything in particular to eat, but first they took off the boxes\n      with the guns and the ammunition, till two men came along driving four\n      mules. Dravot up and dances in front of them, singing, 'Sell me four\n      mules.' Says the first man, 'If you are rich enough to buy, you are rich\n      enough to rob;' but before ever he could put his hand to his knife, Dravot\n      breaks his neck over his knee, and the other party runs away. So Carnehan\n      loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the camels, and\n      together we starts forward into those bitter-cold mountaineous parts, and\n      never a road broader than the back of your hand.\"",
                "He paused for a moment, while I asked him if he could remember the nature\n      of the country through which he had journeyed.",
                "\"I am telling you as straight as I can, but my head isn't as good as it\n      might be. They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot\n      died. The country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary, and\n      the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary. They went up and up, and down\n      and down, and that other party, Carnehan, was imploring of Dravot not to\n      sing and whistle so loud, for fear of bringing down the tremenjus\n      avalanches. But Dravot says that if a King couldn't sing it wasn't worth\n      being King, and whacked the mules over the rump, and never took no heed\n      for ten cold days. We came to a big level valley all among the mountains,\n      and the mules were near dead, so we killed them, not having anything in\n      special for them or us to eat. We sat upon the boxes, and played odd and\n      even with the cartridges that was jolted out.",
                "\"Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley, chasing twenty\n      men with bows and arrows, and the row was tremenjus.",
                "\"They was fair men -- fairer than you or me -- with yellow hair and\n      remarkable well built. Says Dravot, unpacking the guns, 'This is the\n      beginning of the business. We'll fight for the ten men,' and with that he\n      fires two rifles at the twenty men, and drops one of them at two hundred\n      yards from the rock where he was sitting. The other men began to run, but\n      Carnehan and Dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges, up\n      and down the valley. Then we goes up to the ten men that had run across\n      the snow too, and they fires a footy little arrow at us. Dravot he shoots\n      above their heads, and they all falls down flat. Then he walks over them\n      and kicks them, and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to\n      make them friendly like. He calls them and gives them the boxes to carry,\n      and waves his hand for all the world as though he was King already. They\n      takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood\n      on the top, where there was half a dozen big stone idols. Dravot he goes\n      to the biggest -- a fellow they call Imbra -- and lays a rifle and a\n      cartridge at his feet, rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nose,\n      patting him on the head, and nods his head, and says, 'That's all right.\n      I'm in the know too, and these old jimjams are my friends.' Then he opens\n      his mouth and points down it, and when the first man brings him food, he\n      says, 'No;' and when the second man brings him food, he says 'no;' but\n      when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food,\n      he says, 'Yes;' very haughty, and eats it slow. That was how he came to\n      our first village without any trouble, just as though we had tumbled from\n      the skies. But we tumbled from one of those damned rope-bridges, you see,\n      and -- you couldn't expect a man to laugh much after that?\"",
                "\"Take some more whisky and go on,\" I said. \"That was the first village you\n      came into. How did you get to be King?\"",
                "\"I wasn't King,\" said Carnehan. \"Dravot he was the King, and a handsome\n      man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all. Him and the other\n      party stayed in that village, and every morning Dravot sat by the side of\n      old Imbra, and the people came and worshipped. That was Dravot's order.\n      Then a lot of men came into the valley, and Carnehan Dravot picks them off\n      with the rifles before they knew where they was, and runs down into the\n      valley and up again the other side, and finds another village, same as the\n      first one, and the people all falls down flat on their faces, and Dravot\n      says, 'Now what is the trouble between you two villages?' and the people\n      points to a woman, as fair as you or me, that was carried off, and Dravot\n      takes her back to the first village and counts up the dead -- eight\n      there was. For each dead man Dravot pours a little milk on the ground and\n      waves his arms like a whirligig, and 'That's all right,' says he. Then he\n      and Carnehan takes the big boss of each village by the arm, and walks them\n      down the valley, and shows them how to scratch a line with a spear right\n      down the valley, and gives each a sod of turf from both sides of the line.\n      Then all the people comes down and shouts like the devil and all, and\n      Dravot says, 'Go and dig the land, and be fruitful and multiply,' which\n      they did, though they didn't understand. Then we asks the names of things\n      in their lingo -- bread and water and fire and idols and such; and\n      Dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol, and says he must\n      sit there and judge the people, and if anything goes wrong he is to be\n      shot.",
                "\"Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees\n      and much prettier, and the priests heard all the complaints and told\n      Dravot in dumb-show what it was about. 'That's just the beginning,' says\n      Dravot. 'They think we're Gods.' He and Carnehan picks out twenty good men\n      and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in\n      line; and they was very pleased to do so, and clever to see the hang of\n      it. Then he takes out his pipe and his baccy-pouch, and leaves one at one\n      village and one at the other, and off we two goes to see what was to be\n      done in the next valley. That was all rock, and there was a little village\n      there, and Carnehan says, 'Send 'em to the old valley to plant,' and takes\n      'em there and gives 'em some land that wasn't took before. They were a\n      poor lot, and we blooded 'em with a kid before letting 'em into the new\n      Kingdom. That was to impress the people, and then they settled down quiet,\n      and Carnehan went back to Dravot, who had got into another valley, all\n      snow and ice and most mountaineous.",
                "\"There was no people there, and the Army got afraid; so Dravot shoots one\n      of them, and goes on till he finds some people in a village, and the Army\n      explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not\n      shoot their little matchlocks, for they had matchlocks. We makes friends\n      with the priest, and I stays there alone with two of the Army, teaching\n      the men how to drill; and a thundering big Chief comes across the snow\n      with kettledrums and horns twanging, because he heard there was a new God\n      kicking about. Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across\n      the snow and wings one of them. Then he sends a message to the Chief that,\n      unless he wished to be killed, he must come and shake hands with me and\n      leave his arms behind. The Chief comes alone first, and Carnehan shakes\n      hands with him and whirls his arms about, same as Dravot used, and very\n      much surprised that Chief was, and strokes my eyebrows. Then Carnehan goes\n      alone to the Chief, and asks him in dumb-show if he had an enemy he hated.\n      'I have,' says the chief. So Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men, and\n      sets the two of the Army to show them drill, and at the end of two weeks\n      the men can manoeuvre about as well as Volunteers. So he marches with the\n      Chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain, and the Chief's men\n      rushes into a village and takes it, we three Martinis firing into the\n      brown of the enemy. So we took that village too, and I gives the Chief a\n      rag from my coat, and says, 'Occupy till I come;' which was scriptural. By\n      way of a reminder, when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away, I\n      drops a bullet near him standing on the snow, and all the people falls\n      flat on their faces. Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever he be by\n      land or by sea.\"",
                "At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted: \"How\n      could you write a letter up yonder?\"",
                "\"The letter? -- oh! -- the letter! Keep looking at me between the\n      eyes, please. It was a string-talk letter, that we'd learned the way of it\n      from a blind beggar in the Punjab.\"",
                "I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a\n      knotted twig, and a piece of string which he wound round the twig\n      according to some cipher of his own. He could, after the lapse of days or\n      hours, repeat the sentence which he had reeled up.",
                "He had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds, and tried to teach\n      me his method, but I could not understand.",
                "\"I sent that letter to Dravot,\" said Carnehan, \"and told him to come back\n      because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle; and then I\n      struck for the first valley, to see how the priests were working. They\n      called the village we took along with the Chief, Bashkai, and the first\n      village we took, Er-Heb. The priests at Er-Heb was doing all right, but\n      they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me, and some men from\n      another village had been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked for\n      that village, and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards. That used\n      all the cartridges I cared to spend, and I waited for Dravot, who had been\n      away two or three months, and I kept my people quiet.",
                "\"One morning I heard the devil's own noise of drums and horns, and Dan\n      Dravot marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of men,\n      and, which was the most amazing, a great gold crown on his head. 'My Gord,\n      Carnehan,' says Daniel, 'this is a tremenjus business, and we've got the\n      whole country as far as it's worth having. I am the son of Alexander by\n      Queen Semiramis, and you're my younger brother and a God too! It's the\n      biggest thing we've ever seen. I've been marching and fighting for six\n      weeks with the Army, and every footy little village for fifty miles has\n      come in rejoiceful; and more than that, I've got the key of the whole\n      show, as you'll see, and I've got a crown for you! I told 'em to make two\n      of 'em at a place called Shu, where the gold lies in the rock like suet in\n      mutton. Gold I've seen, and turquoise I've kicked out of the cliffs, and\n      there's garnets in the sands of the river, and here's a chunk of amber\n      that a man brought me. Call up all the priests and, here, take your\n      crown.'",
                "\"One of the men opens a black hair bag, and I slips the crown on. It was\n      too small and too heavy, but I wore it for the glory. Hammered gold it was -- five\n      pounds weight, like a hoop of a barrel.",
                "\"'Peachey,' says Dravot, 'we don't want to fight no more. The Craft's the\n      trick, so help me!' and he brings forward that same Chief that I left at\n      Bashkai -- Billy Fish we called him afterward, because he was so like\n      Billy Fish that drove the big tank-engine at Mach on the Bolan in the old\n      days. 'Shake hands with him,' says Dravot; and I shook hands and nearly\n      dropped, for Billy Fish gave me the Grip. I said nothing, but tried him\n      with the Fellow-craft Grip. He answers all right, and I tried the Master's\n      Grip, but that was a slip. 'A Fellow-craft he is!' I says to Dan. 'Does he\n      know the word?' 'He does,' says Dan, 'and all the priests know. It's a\n      miracle! The Chiefs and the priests can work a Fellow-craft Lodge in a way\n      that's very like ours, and they've cut the marks on the rocks, but they\n      don't know the Third Degree, and they've come to find out. It's Gord's\n      Truth. I've known these long years that the Afghans knew up to the\n      Fellow-craft Degree, but this is a miracle. A God and a Grand Master of\n      the Craft am I, and a Lodge in the Third Degree I will open, and we'll\n      raise the head priests and the Chiefs of the villages.'",
                "\"'It's against all the law,' I says, 'holding a Lodge without warrant from\n      any one; and you know we never held office in any Lodge.'",
                "\"'It's a master stroke o' policy,' says Dravot. 'It means running the\n      country as easy as a four-wheeled bogie on a down grade. We can't stop to\n      inquire now, or they'll turn against us. I've forty Chiefs at my heel, and\n      passed and raised according to their merit they shall be. Billet these men\n      on the villages, and see that we run up a Lodge of some kind. The temple\n      of Imbra will do for a Lodge-room. The women must make aprons as you show\n      them. I'll hold a levee of Chiefs tonight and Lodge tomorrow.'",
                "\"I was fair run off my legs, but I wasn't such a fool as not to see what a\n      pull this Craft business gave us. I showed the priests' families how to\n      make aprons of the degrees, but for Dravot's apron the blue border and\n      marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide, not cloth. We took a\n      great square stone in the temple for the Master's chair, and little stones\n      for the officer's chairs, and painted the black pavement with white\n      squares, and did what we could to make things regular.",
                "\"At the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big bonfires,\n      Dravot gives out that him and me were Gods and sons of Alexander, and\n      Passed Grand Masters in the Craft, and was come to make Kafiristan a\n      country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet, and\n      specially obey us. Then the Chiefs come round to shake hands, and they\n      were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old\n      friends. We gave them names according as they was like men we had known in\n      India -- Billy Fish, Holly Dilworth, Pikky Kergan, that was\n      Bazaar-master when I was at Mhow, and so on, and so on.",
                "\"The most amazing miracles was at Lodge next night. One of the old priests\n      was watching us continuous, and I felt uneasy, for I knew we'd have to\n      fudge the Ritual, and I didn't know what the men knew. The old priest was\n      a stranger come in from beyond the village of Bashkai. The minute Dravot\n      puts on the Master's apron that the girls had made for him, the priest\n      fetches a whoop and a howl, and tries to overturn the stone that Dravot\n      was sitting on. 'It's all up now,' I says. 'That comes of meddling with\n      the Craft without warrant!' Dravot never winked an eye, not when ten\n      priests took and tilted over the Grand Master's chair -- which was to\n      say, the stone of Imbra. The priest begins rubbing the bottom end of it to\n      clear away the black dirt, and presently he shows all the other priests\n      the Master's Mark, same as was on Dravot's apron, cut into the stone. Not\n      even the priests of the temple of Imbra knew it was there. The old chap\n      falls flat on his face at Dravot's feet and kisses 'em. 'Luck again,' says\n      Dravot, across the Lodge, to me; 'they say it's the missing Mark that no\n      one could understand the why of.",
                "\"'We're more than safe now.' Then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel\n      and says, 'By virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right hand\n      and the help of Peachey, I declare myself Grand Master of all Freemasonry\n      in Kafiristan in this the Mother Lodge o' the country, and King of\n      Kafiristan equally with Peachey!' At that he puts on his crown and I puts\n      on mine, -- I was doing Senior Warden, -- and we opens the Lodge in\n      most ample form. It was an amazing miracle! The priests moved in Lodge\n      through the first two degrees almost without telling, as if the memory was\n      coming back to them. After that Peachey and Dravot raised such as was\n      worthy -- high priests and Chiefs of far-off villages. Billy Fish was\n      the first, and I can tell you we scared the soul out of him. It was not in\n      any way according to Ritual, but it served our turn. We didn't raise more\n      than ten of the biggest men, because we didn't want to make the Degree\n      common. And they was clamouring to be raised.",
                "\"'In another six months,' says Dravot, 'we'll hold another Communication\n      and see how you are working.' Then he asks them about their villages, and\n      learns that they was fighting one against the other, and were sick and\n      tired of it. And when they wasn't doing that they was fighting with the\n      Mohammedans. 'You can fight those when they come into our country,' says\n      Dravot. 'Tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a Frontier guard, and\n      send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled. Nobody is going\n      to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well, and I know that\n      you won't cheat me, because you're white people -- sons of Alexander -- and\n      not like common black Mohammedans. You are my people, and, by God,' says\n      he, running off into English at the end, 'I'll make a damned fine Nation\n      of you, or I'll die in the making!'",
                "\"I can't tell all we did for the next six months, because Dravot did a lot\n      I couldn't see the hang of, and he learned their lingo in a way I never\n      could. My work was to help the people plough, and now and again go out\n      with some of the Army and see what the other villages were doing, and make\n      'em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the country horrid.\n      Dravot was very kind to me, but when he walked up and down in the pine\n      wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both fists I knew he was\n      thinking plans I could not advise about, and I just waited for orders.",
                "\"But Dravot never showed me disrespect before the people. They were afraid\n      of me and the Army, but they loved Dan. He was the best of friends with\n      the priests and the Chiefs; but any one could come across the hills with a\n      complaint, and Dravot would hear him out fair, and call four priests\n      together and say what was to be done.",
                "\"He used to call in Billy Fish from Bashkai, and Pikky Kergan from Shu,\n      and an old Chief we called Kafuzelum, -- it was like enough to his real\n      name, -- and hold councils with 'em when there was any fighting to be\n      done in small villages. That was his Council of War, and the four priests\n      of Bashkai, Shu, Khawak, and Madora was his Privy Council. Between the lot\n      of 'em they sent me, with forty men and twenty rifles, and sixty men\n      carrying turquoises, into the Ghorband country to buy those hand-made\n      Martini rifles, that come out of the Amir's workshops at Kabul, from one\n      of the Amir's Herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of\n      their mouths for turquoises.",
                "\"I stayed in Ghorband a month, and gave the Governor there the pick of my\n      baskets for hush-money, and bribed the Colonel of the regiment some more,\n      and, between the two and the tribes-people, we got more than a hundred\n      hand-made Martinis, a hundred good Kohat Jezails that'll throw to six\n      hundred yards, and forty man -- loads of very bad ammunition for the\n      rifles. I came back with what I had, and distributed 'em among the men\n      that the Chiefs sent in to me to drill. Dravot was too busy to attend to\n      those things, but the old Army that we first made helped me, and we turned\n      out five hundred men that could drill, and two hundred that knew how to\n      hold arms pretty straight. Even those cork-screwed, hand-made guns was a\n      miracle to them. Dravot talked big about powder-shops and factories,\n      walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was coming on.",

They sit on chairs in their own houses.\n      They're the Lost Tribes, or something like it, and they've grown to be\n      English. I'll take a census in the spring if the priests don't get\n      frightened. There must be a fair two million of 'em in these hills. The\n      villages are full o' little children. Two million people -- two hundred\n      and fifty thousand fighting men -- and all English! They only want the\n      rifles and a little drilling. Two hundred and fifty thousand men, ready to\n      cut in on Russia's right flank when she tries for India! Peachey, man,' he\n      says, chewing his beard in great hunks, 'we shall be Emperors -- Emperors\n      of the Earth! Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to us. I'll treat with the\n      Viceroy on equal terms. I'll ask him to send me twelve picked English -- twelve\n      that I know of -- to help us govern a bit. There's Mackray, Serjeant\n      Pensioner at Segowli -- many's the good dinner he's given me, and his\n      wife a pair of trousers. There's Donkin, the Warder of Tounghoo Jail;\n      there's hundreds that I could lay my hand on if I was in India. The\n      Viceroy shall do it for me; I'll send a man through in the spring for\n      those men, and I'll write for a dispensation from the Grand Lodge for what\n      I've done as Grand Master. That -- and all the Sniders that'll be\n      thrown out when the native troops in India take up the Martini. They'll be\n      worn smooth, but they'll do for fighting in these hills. Twelve English, a\n      hundred thousand Sniders run through the Amir's country in driblets, -- I'd\n      be content with twenty thousand in one year, -- and we'd be an Empire.",

You know Dravot, Sir! You knew Right\n      Worshipful Brother Dravot! Look at him now!\"",
                "He fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist; brought out a black\n      horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread; and shook therefrom on to my\n      table -- the dried, withered head of Daniel Dravot! The morning sun,\n      that had long been paling the lamps, struck the red beard and blind sunken\n      eyes; struck, too, a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw turquoises,\n      that Carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples.",
                "\"You be'old now,\" said Carnehan, \"the Emperor in his 'abit as he lived -- the\n      King of Kafiristan with his crown upon his head. Poor old Daniel that was\n      a monarch once!\"",
                "I shuddered, for, in spite of defacements manifold, I recognised the head\n      of the man of Marwar Junction. Carnehan rose to go. I attempted to stop\n      him. He was not fit to walk abroad. \"Let me take away the whisky, and give\n      me a little money,\" he gasped. \"I was a King once. I'll go to the Deputy\n      Commissioner and ask to set in the Poorhouse till I get my health. No,\n      thank you, I can't wait till you get a carriage for me. I've urgent\n      private affairs -- in the south -- at Marwar.\"",
                "He shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the Deputy\n      Commissioner's house. That day at noon I had occasion to go down the\n      blinding-hot Mall, and I saw a crooked man crawling along the white dust\n      of the roadside, his hat in his hand, quavering dolorously after the\n      fashion of street-singers at Home. There was not a soul in sight, and he\n      was out of all possible earshot of the houses. And he sang through his\n      nose, turning his head from right to left:",
                "\"The Son of Man goes forth to war,\n    A golden crown to gain;\n    His blood-red banner streams afar -- \n    Who follows in His train?\"",
                "I waited to hear no more, but put the poor wretch into my carriage and\n      drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the\n      Asylum. He repeated the hymn twice while he was with me, whom he did not\n      in the least recognise, and I left him singing it to the missionary.",
                "Two days later I inquired after his welfare of the Superintendent of the\n      Asylum.",
                "\"He was admitted suffering from sunstroke. He died early yesterday\n      morning,\" said the Superintendent. \"Is it true that he was half an hour\n      bareheaded in the sun at midday?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" said I; \"but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by\n      any chance when he died?\"",
                "\"Not to my knowledge,\" said the Superintendent.",

                "\"O' ever the knightly years were gone\n  With the old world to the grave,\n  I was a king in Babylon\n  And you were a Christian slave.\"\n                  -- W. E. Henley.",
                "His name was Charlie Mears; he was the only son of his mother who was a\n      widow, and he lived in the north of London, coming into the City every day\n      to work in a bank. He was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations.\n      I met him in a public billiard-saloon where the marker called him by his\n      given name, and he called the marker \"Bulls-eyes.\" Charley explained, a\n      little nervously, that he had only come to the place to look on, and since\n      looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young, I\n      suggested that Charlie should go back to his mother.",
                "That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on me\n      sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his\n      fellow-clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must,\n      he told me of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to make\n      himself an undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not above\n      sending stories of love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot\n      journals. It was my fate to sit still while Charlie read me poems of many\n      hundred lines, and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the\n      world. My reward was his unreserved confidence, and the self-revelations\n      and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden.",
                "Charlie had never fallen in love, but was anxious to do so on the first\n      opportunity; he believed in all things good and all things honorable, but,\n      at the same time, was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way\n      about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twenty-five shillings a week.\n      He rhymed \"dove\" with \"love\" and \"moon\" with \"June,\" and devoutly believed\n      that they had never so been rhymed before. The long lame gaps in his plays\n      he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on,\n      seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already\n      done, and turned to me for applause.",
                "I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations, and I know that\n      his writing-table at home was the edge of his washstand. This he told me\n      almost at the outset of our acquaintance; when he was ravaging my\n      bookshelves, and a little before I was implored to speak the truth as to\n      his chances of \"writing something really great, you know.\" Maybe I\n      encouraged him too much, for, one night, he called on me, his eyes flaming\n      with excitement, and said breathlessly:",
                "\"Do you mind -- can you let me stay here and write all this evening? I\n      won't interrupt you, I won't really. There's no place for me to write in\n      at my mother's.\"",
                "\"What's the trouble?\" I said, knowing well what that trouble was.",
                "\"I've a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that was\n      ever written. Do let me write it out here. It's such a notion!\"",
                "There was no resisting the appeal. I set him a table; he hardly thanked\n      me, but plunged into the work at once. For half an hour the pen scratched\n      without stopping. Then Charlie sighed and tugged his hair. The scratching\n      grew slower, there were more erasures, and at last ceased. The finest\n      story in the world would not come forth.",
                "\"It looks such awful rot now\" he said, mournfully. \"And yet it seemed so\n      good when I was thinking about it. What's wrong?\"",
                "I could not dishearten him by saying the truth. So I answered: \"Perhaps\n      you don't feel in the mood for writing.\"",
                "\"Yes I do -- except when I look at this stuff. Ugh!\"",
                "\"Read me what you've done,\" I said. He read, and it was wondrous bad and\n      he paused at all the specially turgid sentences, expecting a little\n      approval; for he was proud of those sentences, as I knew he would be.",
                "\"It needs compression,\" I suggested, cautiously.",
                "\"I hate cutting my things down. I don't think you could alter a word here\n      without spoiling the sense. It reads better aloud than when I was writing\n      it.\"",
                "\"Charlie, you're suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a numerous\n      class. Put the thing by, and tackle it again in a week.\"",

                "Charlie told, and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance\n      had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word. I looked\n      at him, and wondering whether it were possible, that he did not know the\n      originality, the power of the notion that had come in his way? It was\n      distinctly a Notion among notions. Men had been puffed up with pride by\n      notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable. But Charlie babbled on\n      serenely, interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of horrible\n      sentences that he purposed to use. I heard him out to the end. It would be\n      folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands, when I could do\n      so much with it. Not all that could be done indeed; but, oh so much!",
                "\"What do you think?\" he said, at last. \"I fancy I shall call it 'The Story\n      of a Ship.'\"",
                "\"I think the idea's pretty good; but you won't Be able to handle it for\n      ever so long. Now I -- \"",
                "\"Would it be of any use to you? Would you care to take it? I should be\n      proud,\" said Charlie, promptly.",
                "There are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless, hot-headed,\n      intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even a woman in her blindest\n      devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores, tilt her\n      bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech\n      with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still it was\n      necessary to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of Charlie's\n      thoughts.",
                "\"Let's make a bargain. I'll give you a fiver for the notion,\" I said.",
                "Charlie became a bank-clerk at once.",
                "\"Oh, that's impossible. Between two pals, you know, if I may call you so,\n      and speaking as a man of the world, I couldn't. Take the notion if it's\n      any use to you. I've heaps more.\"",
                "He had -- none knew this better than I -- but they were the notions\n      of other men.",
                "\"Look at it as a matter of business -- between men of the world,\" I\n      returned. \"Five pounds will buy you any number of poetry-books. Business\n      is business, and you may be sure I shouldn't give that price unless -- \"",
                "\"Oh, if you put it that way,\" said Charlie, visibly moved by the thought\n      of the books. The bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at\n      unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed,\n      should have a table of his own to write at, and unquestioned right to\n      inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems. Then I said, \"Now\n      tell me how you came by this idea.\"",
                "\"It came by itself.\" Charlie's eyes opened a little.",
                "\"Yes, but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read\n      before somewhere.\"",
                "\"I haven't any time for reading, except when you let me sit here, and on\n      Sundays I'm on my bicycle or down the river all day. There's nothing wrong\n      about the hero, is there?\"",
                "\"Tell me again and I shall understand clearly. You say that your hero went\n      pirating. How did he live?\"",
                "\"He was on the lower deck of this ship-thing that I was telling you\n      about.\"",
                "\"What sort of ship?\"",
                "\"It was the kind rowed with oars, and the sea spurts through the oar-holes\n      and the men row sitting up to their knees in water. Then there's a bench\n      running down between the two lines of oars and an overseer with a whip\n      walks up and down the bench to make the men work.\"",
                "\"How do you know that?\"",
                "\"It's in the table. There's a rope running overhead, looped to the upper\n      deck, for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls. When the\n      overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers, remember the\n      hero laughs at him and gets licked for it. He's chained to his oar of\n      course -- the hero.\"",
                "\"How is he chained?\"",
                "\"With an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on, and a\n      sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar. He's on the\n      lower deck where the worst men are sent, and the only light comes from the\n      hatchways and through the oar-holes. Can't you imagine the sunlight just\n      squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling about as\n      the ship moves?\"",
                "\"I can, but I can't imagine your imagining it.\"",
                "\"How could it be any other way? Now you listen to me. The long oars on the\n      upper deck are managed by four men to each bench, the lower ones by three,\n      and the lowest of all by two. Remember it's quite dark on the lowest deck\n      and all the men there go mad. When a man dies at his oar on that deck he\n      isn't thrown overboard, but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the\n      oar-hole in little pieces.\"",
                "\"Why?\" I demanded, amazed, not so much at the information as the tone of\n      command in which it was flung out.",
                "\"To save trouble and to frighten the others. It needs two overseers to\n      drag a man's body up to the top deck; and if the men at the lower deck\n      oars were left alone, of course they'd stop rowing and try to pull up the\n      benches by all standing up together in their chains.\"",
                "\"You've a most provident imagination. Where have you been reading about\n      galleys and galley-slaves?\"",
                "\"Nowhere that I remember. I row a little when I get the chance. But,\n      perhaps, if you say so, I may have read something.\"",
                "He went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers, and I wondered\n      how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate\n      abundance of detail, all given with absolute assurance, the story of\n      extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure, riot, piracy, and death in unnamed\n      seas. He had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt against the\n      overseas, to command of a ship of his own, and ultimate establishment of a\n      kingdom on an island \"somewhere in the sea, you know\"; and, delighted with\n      my paltry five pounds, had gone out to buy the notions of other men, that\n      these might teach him how to write.

Small\n      wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to Charlie. The Fates that are so\n      careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had, in this\n      case, been neglectful, and Charlie was looking, though that he did not\n      know, where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge since\n      Time began. Above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to\n      me for five pounds; and he would retain that ignorance, for bank-clerks do\n      not understand metempsychosis, and a sound commercial education does not\n      include Greek. He would supply me -- here I capered among the dumb gods\n      of Egypt and laughed in their battered faces -- with material to make\n      my tale sure -- so sure that the world would hail it as an impudent and\n      vamped fiction.

Knowing now what the boy had been in his past\n      lives, and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble, I could\n      not hide from him my respect and interest. He misconstrued both into\n      respect for the present soul of Charlie Mears, to whom life was as new as\n      it was to Adam, and interest in his readings; and stretched my patience to\n      breaking point by reciting poetry -- not his own now, but that of\n      others. I wished every English poet blotted out of the memory of mankind.\n      I blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn Charlie\n      from the path of direct narrative, and would, later, spur him to imitate\n      them; but I choked down my impatience until the first flood of enthusiasm\n      should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams.",
                "\"What's the use of my telling you what I think, when these chaps wrote\n      things for the angels to read?\" he growled, one evening. \"Why don't you\n      write something like theirs?\"",
                "\"I don't think you're treating me quite fairly,\" I said, speaking under\n      strong restraint.",
                "\"I've given you the story,\" he said, shortly replunging into \"Lara.\"",
                "\"But I want the details.\"",
                "\"The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley?\n      They're quite easy. You can just make 'em up yourself. Turn up the gas a\n      little, I want to go on reading.\"",
                "I could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing stupidity.\n      I could indeed make up things for myself did I only know what Charlie did\n      not know that he knew. But since the doors were shut behind me I could\n      only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him in good temper. One\n      minute's want of guard might spoil a priceless revelation: now and again\n      he would toss his books aside -- he kept them in my rooms, for his\n      mother would have been shocked at the waste of good money had she seen\n      them -- and launched into his sea dreams. Again I cursed all the poets\n      of England. The plastic mind of the bank-clerk had been overlaid, colored\n      and distorted by that which he had read, and the result as delivered was a\n      confused tangle of other voices most like the muttered song through a City\n      telephone in the busiest part of the day.",
                "He talked of the galley -- his own galley had he but known it -- with\n      illustrations borrowed from the \"Bride of Abydos.\" He pointed the\n      experiences of his hero with quotations from \"The Corsair,\" and threw in\n      deep and desperate moral reflections from \"Cain\" and \"Manfred,\" expecting\n      me to use them all. Only when the talk turned on Longfellow were the\n      jarring cross-currents dumb, and I knew that Charlie was speaking the\n      truth as he remembered it.",
                "\"What do you think of this?\" I said one evening, as soon as I understood\n      the medium in which his memory worked best, and, before he could\n      expostulate read him the whole of \"The Saga of King Olaf!\"",
                "He listened open-mouthed, flushed his hands drumming on the back of the\n      sofa where he lay, till I came to the Songs of Emar Tamberskelver and the\n      verse:",

                "\"No, I'm tired. Let's talk. What happened the other night?\"",
                "\"I had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours. I dreamed I was\n      drowned in a fight. You see we ran alongside another ship in harbor.

I could hear the water sizzle,\n      and we spun round like a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, that\n      there was a galley coming up bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could\n      just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to meet\n      her bow to bow, but it was too late. We could only turn a little bit\n      because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped\n      our moving. Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our left oars began to break\n      as the other galley, the moving one y'know, stuck her nose into them. Then\n      the lower-deck oars shot up through the deck-planking, butt first, and one\n      of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my\n      head.\"",

Then\n      her nose caught us nearly in the middle, and we tilted sideways, and the\n      fellows in the right-hand galley unhitched their hooks and ropes, and\n      threw things on to our upper deck -- arrows, and hot pitch or something\n      that stung, and we went up and up and up on the left side, and the right\n      side dipped, and I twisted my head round and saw the water stand still as\n      it topped the right bulwarks, and then it curled over and crashed down on\n      the whole lot of us on the right side, and I felt it hit my back, and I\n      woke.\"",
                "\"One minute, Charlie. When the sea topped the bulwarks, what did it look\n      like?\" I had my reasons for asking.

                "\"It looked just like a banjo-string drawn tight, and it seemed to stay\n      there for years,\" said Charlie.",
                "Exactly! The other man had said: \"It looked like a silver wire laid down\n      along the bulwarks, and I thought it was never going to break.\" He had\n      paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of\n      knowledge, and I had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and\n      take his knowledge at second hand. But Charlie, the bank-clerk, on\n      twenty-five shillings a week, he who had never been out of sight of a\n      London omnibus, knew it all. It was no consolation to me that once in his\n      lives he had been forced to die for his gains. I also must have died\n      scores of times, but behind me, because I could have used my knowledge,\n      the doors were shut.",

It seemed as if I'd been in a good many fights,\n      because I told my next man so when the row began. But that cad of an\n      overseer on my deck wouldn't unloose our chains and give us a chance. He\n      always said that we'd all Be set free after a battle, but we never were;\n      We never were.\" Charlie shook his head mournfully.",

                "I handed him the book and wrote out as much as I could remember of his\n      description of the sea-fight, appealing to him from time to time for\n      confirmation of fact or detail. He would answer without raising his eyes\n      from the book, as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint\n      on the printed page. I spoke under the normal key of my voice that the\n      current might not be broken, and I know that he was not aware of what he\n      was saying, for his thoughts were out on the sea with Longfellow.",

                "\"Tore up the benches and brained 'em. That happened when a heavy sea was\n      running. An overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and\n      fell among the rowers. They choked him to death against the side of the\n      ship with their chained hands quite quietly, and it was too dark for the\n      other overseer to see what had happened. When he asked, he was pulled down\n      too and choked, and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck, with\n      the pieces of the broken benches banging behind 'em. How they howled!\"",

Till that evening Charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie\n      within the experiences of a Greek galley-slave. But now, or there was no\n      virtue in books, he had talked of some desperate adventure of the Vikings,\n      of Thorfin Karlsefne's sailing to Wineland, which is America, in the ninth\n      or tenth century. The battle in the harbor he had seen; and his own death\n      he had described. But this was a much more startling plunge into the past.\n      Was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was then dimly\n      remembering some episode of a thousand years later? It was a maddening\n      jumble, and the worst of it was that Charlie Mears in his normal condition\n      was the last person in the world to clear it up. I could only wait and\n      watch, but I went to bed that night full of the wildest imaginings. There\n      was nothing that was not possible if Charlie's detestable memory only held\n      good.",

But I was entirely at Charlie's mercy, and so long as there\n      was a three-and-six-penny Bohn volume within his reach Charlie would not\n      tell. I dared not curse him openly; I hardly dared jog his memory, for I\n      was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years ago, told through the\n      mouth of a boy of today; and a boy of today is affected by every change of\n      tone and gust of opinion, so that he lies even when he desires to speak\n      the truth.",
                "I saw no more of him for nearly a week. When next I met him it was in\n      Gracechurch Street with a billbook chained to his waist.",

                "As we passed over the Thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading\n      great slabs of white and brown marble. A barge drifted under the steamer's\n      stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed.",
                "Charlie's face changed from the face of the bank-clerk to that of an\n      unknown and -- though he would not have believed this -- a much\n      shrewder man. He flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge, and\n      laughing very loudly, said: \"When they heard our bulls bellow the\n      Skroelings ran away!\"",
                "I waited only for an instant, but the barge and the cow had disappeared\n      under the bows of the steamer before I answered.",

I've a notion for a poem.\"",
                "\"No, thanks. I'm off. You're sure you know nothing about Skroelings?\"",
                "\"Not unless he's been entered for the Liverpool Handicap.\" He nodded and\n      disappeared in the crowd.",
                "Now it is written in the Saga of Eric the Red or that of Thorfin\n      Karlsefne, that nine hundred years ago when Karlsefne's galleys came to\n      Leif's booths, which Leif had erected in the unknown land called Markland,\n      which may or may not have been Rhode Island, the Skroelings -- and the\n      Lord He knows who these may or may not have been -- came to trade with\n      the Vikings, and ran away because they were frightened at the bellowing of\n      the cattle which Thorfin had brought with him in the ships. But what in\n      the world could a Greek slave know of that affair? I wandered up and down\n      among the streets trying to unravel the mystery, and the more I considered\n      it, the more baffling it grew. One thing only seemed certain and that\n      certainty took away my breath for the moment. If I came to full knowledge\n      of anything at all, it would not be one life of the soul in Charlie\n      Mears's body, but half a dozen -- half a dozen several and separate\n      existences spent on blue water in the morning of the world!",
                "Then I walked round the situation.",
                "Obviously if I used my knowledge I should stand alone and unapproachable\n      until all men were as wise as myself. That would be something, but manlike\n      I was ungrateful. It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlie's memory should\n      fail me when I needed it most.",
                "Great Powers above -- I looked up at them through the fog smoke -- did\n      the Lords of Life and Death know what this meant to me? Nothing less than\n      eternal fame of the best kind; that comes from One, and is shared by one\n      alone. I would be content -- remembering Clive, I stood astounded at my\n      own moderation, -- with the mere right to tell one story, to work out\n      one little contribution to the light literature of the day. If Charlie\n      were permitted full recollection for one hour -- for sixty short\n      minutes -- of existences that had extended over a thousand years -- I\n      would forego all profit and honor from all that I should make of his\n      speech. I would take no share in the commotion that would follow\n      throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself \"the\n      world.\" The thing should be put forth anonymously. Nay, I would make other\n      men believe that they had written it. They would hire bull-hided\n      self-advertising Englishmen to bellow it abroad. Preachers would found a\n      fresh conduct of life upon it, swearing that it was new and that they had\n      lifted the fear of death from all mankind. Every Orientalist in Europe\n      would patronize it discursively with Sanskrit and Pali texts. Terrible\n      women would invent unclean variants of the men's belief for the elevation\n      of their sisters. Churches and religions would war over it. Between the\n      hailing and re-starting of an omnibus I foresaw the scuffles that would\n      arise among half a dozen denominations all professing \"the doctrine of the\n      True Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Era\"; and saw,\n      too, the respectable English newspapers shying, like frightened kine, over\n      the beautiful simplicity of the tale. The mind leaped forward a hundred -- two\n      hundred -- a thousand years. I saw with sorrow that men would mutilate\n      and garble the story; that rival creeds would turn it upside down till, at\n      last, the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely\n      than the hope of life, would set it aside as an interesting superstition\n      and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether\n      new. Upon this I changed the terms of the bargain that I would make with\n      the Lords of Life and Death. Only let me know, let me write, the story\n      with sure knowledge that I wrote the truth, and I would burn the\n      manuscript as a solemn sacrifice. Five minutes after the last line was\n      written I would destroy it all. But I must be allowed to write it with\n      absolute certainty.",
                "There was no answer. The flaming colors of an Aquarium poster caught my\n      eye and I wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure Charlie\n      into the hands of the professional mesmerist, and whether, if he were\n      under his power, he would speak of his past lives. If he did, and if\n      people believed him -- but Charlie would be frightened and flustered,\n      or made conceited by the interviews. In either case he would begin to lie,\n      through fear or vanity. He was safest in my own hands.",

The old man was a retired native official, and on an\n      income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred\n      pounds a year, and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend\n      to be the cadet of a royal house, and tell stories of the brutal Indian\n      bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor.",
                "Grish Chunder was a young, fat, full-bodied Bengali dressed with\n      scrupulous care in frock coat, tall hat, light trousers and tan gloves.\n      But I had known him in the days when the brutal Indian Government paid for\n      his university education, and he contributed cheap sedition to Sachi\n      Durpan, and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates.",
                "\"That is very funny and very foolish,\" he said, nodding at the poster. \"I\n      am going down to the Northbrook Club. Will you come too?\"",

                "Surely, I thought he would remember now that he had served in two galleys\n      at least -- in a three-decked Greek one under the black-haired\n      \"political man,\" and again in a Viking's open sea-serpent under the man\n      \"red as a red bear\" who went to Markland.

                "\"Ah, but I sha'n't get the credit of that. Tit-Bits would publish my name\n      and address if I win. What are you grinning at? They would.\"",
                "\"I know it. Suppose you go for a walk. I want to look through my notes\n      about our story.\"",
                "Now this reprehensible youth who left me, a little hurt and put back,\n      might for aught he or I knew have been one of the crew of the Argo -- had\n      been certainly slave or comrade to Thorfin Karlsefne. Therefore he was\n      deeply interested in guinea competitions. Remembering what Grish Chunder\n      had said I laughed aloud. The Lords of Life and Death would never allow\n      Charlie Mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts, and I must even\n      piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while Charlie\n      wrote of the ways of bank-clerks.",
                "I got together and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result was\n      not cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing that might not\n      have been compiled at second-hand from other people's books -- except,\n      perhaps, the story of the fight in the harbor. The adventures of a Viking\n      bad been written many times before; the history of a Greek galley-slave\n      was no new thing, and though I wrote both, who could challenge or confirm\n      the accuracy of my details? I might as well tell a tale of two thousand\n      years hence. The Lords of Life and Death were as cunning as Grish Chunder\n      had hinted. They would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make\n      easy the minds of men. Though I was convinced of this, yet I could not\n      leave the tale alone. Exaltation followed reaction, not once, but twenty\n      times in the next few weeks. My moods varied with the March sunlight and\n      flying clouds. By night or in the beauty of a spring morning I perceived\n      that I could write that tale and shift continents thereby. In the wet,\n      windy afternoons, I saw that the tale might indeed be written, but would\n      be nothing more than a faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted piece of\n      Wardour Street work at the end. Then I blessed Charlie in many ways -- though\n      it was no fault of his. He seemed to be busy with prize competitions, and\n      I saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and\n      grew ripe to spring, and the buds swelled in their sheaths. He did not\n      care to read or talk of what he had read, and there was a new ring of\n      self-assertion in his voice. I hardly cared to remind him of the galley\n      when we met; but Charlie alluded to it on every occasion, always as a\n      story from which money was to be made.",
                "\"I think I deserve twenty-five per cent., don't I, at least,\" he said,\n      with beautiful frankness. \"I supplied all the ideas, didn't I?\"",
                "This greediness for silver was a new side in his nature. I assumed that it\n      had been developed in the City, where Charlie was picking up the curious\n      nasal drawl of the underbred City man.",
                "\"When the thing's done we'll talk about it. I can't make anything of it at\n      present. Red-haired or black-haired hero are equally difficult.\"",
                "He was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals. \"I can't understand\n      what you find so difficult. It's all as clean as mud to me,\" he replied. A\n      jet of gas puffed out between the bars, took light and whistled softly.\n      \"Suppose we take the red-haired hero's adventures first, from the time\n      that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to the\n      Beaches.\"",
                "I knew better now than to interrupt Charlie. I was out of reach of pen and\n      paper, and dared not move to get them lest I should break the current. The\n      gas-jet puffed and whinnied, Charlie's voice dropped almost to a whisper,\n      and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to Furdurstrandi, of\n      sunsets on the open sea, seen under the curve of the one sail evening\n      after evening when the galley's beak was notched into the centre of the\n      sinking disc, and \"we sailed by that for we had no other guide,\" quoth\n      Charlie. He spoke of a landing on an island and explorations in its woods,\n      where the crew killed three men whom they found asleep under the pines.\n      Their ghosts, Charlie said, followed the galley, swimming and choking in\n      the water, and the crew cast lots and threw one of their number overboard\n      as a sacrifice to the strange gods whom they had offended. Then they ate\n      sea-weed when their provisions failed, and their legs swelled, and their\n      leader, the red-haired man, killed two rowers who mutinied, and after a\n      year spent among the woods they set sail for their own country, and a wind\n      that never failed carried them back so safely that they all slept at\n      night. This and much more Charlie told. Sometimes the voice fell so low\n      that I could not catch the words, though every nerve was on the strain. He\n      spoke of their leader, the red-haired man, as a pagan speaks of his God;\n      for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought\n      best for their needs; and it was he who steered them for three days among\n      floating ice, each floe crowded with strange beasts that \"tried to sail\n      with us,\" said Charlie, \"and we beat them back with the handles of the\n      oars.\"",
                "The gas-jet went out, a burned coal gave way, and the fire settled down\n      with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate. Charlie ceased speaking, and\n      I said no word.",
                "\"By Jove!\" he said, at last, shaking his head. \"I've been staring at the\n      fire till I'm dizzy. What was I going to say?\"",
                "\"Something about the galley.\"",
                "\"I remember now. It's 25 per cent. of the profits, isn't it?\"",
                "\"It's anything you like when I've done the tale.\"",
                "\"I wanted to be sure of that. I must go now. I've, I've an appointment.\"\n       And he left me.",
                "Had my eyes not been held I might have known that that broken muttering\n      over the fire was the swan-song of Charlie Mears. But I thought it the\n      prelude to fuller revelation. At last and at last I should cheat the Lords\n      of Life and Death!",
                "When next Charlie came to me I received him with rapture. He was nervous\n      and embarrassed, but his eyes were very full of light, and his lips a\n      little parted.",
                "\"I've done a poem,\" he said; and then quickly: \"it's the best I've ever\n      done. Read it.\" He thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window.",
                "I groaned inwardly. It would be the work of half an hour to criticise -- that\n      is to say praise -- the poem sufficiently to please Charlie. Then I had\n      good reason to groan, for Charlie, discarding his favorite centipede\n      metres, had launched into shorter and choppier verse, and verse with a\n      motive at the back of it. This is what I read:",

                "\"Yes, it's the early harrowing, past a doubt,\" I said, with a dread at my\n      heart. Charlie smiled, but did not answer.",

                "\"Well?\" said Charlie, looking over my shoulder.",
                "I thought it far from well, and very evil indeed, when he silently laid a\n      photograph on the paper -- the photograph of a girl with a curly head,\n      and a foolish slack mouth.",
                "\"Isn't it -- isn't it wonderful?\" he whispered, pink to the tips of his\n      ears, wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love. \"I didn't know; I didn't\n      think -- it came like a thunderclap.\"",

                "Her bitterest enemies -- and she had many -- could hardly accuse\n      Mrs. Hauksbee of wasting her time. Otis Yeere was one of those wandering\n      \"dumb\" characters, foredoomed through life to be nobody's property. Ten\n      years in Her Majesty's Bengal Civil Service, spent, for the most part, in\n      undesirable Districts, had given him little to be proud of, and nothing to\n      bring confidence. Old enough to have lost the first fine careless rapture\n      that showers on the immature 'Stunt imaginary Commissionerships and Stars,\n      and sends him into the collar with coltish earnestness and abandon; too\n      young to be yet able to look back upon the progress he had made, and thank\n      Providence that under the conditions of the day he had come even so far,\n      he stood upon the \"dead-centre\" of his career. And when a man stands\n      still, he feels the slightest impulse from without. Fortune had ruled that\n      Otis Yeere should be, for the first part of his service, one of the rank\n      and file who are ground up in the wheels of the Administration; losing\n      heart and soul, and mind and strength, in the process. Until steam\n      replaces manual power in the working of the Empire, there must always be\n      this percentage -- must always be the men who are used up, expended, in\n      the mere mechanical routine. For these promotion is far off and the\n      mill-grind of every day very near and instant. The Secretariats know them\n      only by name; they are not the picked men of the Districts with the\n      Divisions and Collectorates awaiting them. They are simply the rank and\n      file -- the food for fever -- sharing with the ryot and the\n      plough-bullock the honor of being the plinth on which the State rests. The\n      older ones have lost their aspirations; the younger are putting theirs\n      aside with a sigh. Both learn to endure patiently until the end of the\n      day. Twelve years in the rank and file, men say, will sap the hearts of\n      the bravest and dull the wits of the most keen.",
                "Out of this life Otis Yeere had fled for a few months, drifting, for the\n      sake of a little masculine society, into Simla. When his leave was over he\n      would return to his swampy, sour-green, undermanned district, the native\n      Assistant, the native Doctor, the native Magistrate, the steaming,\n      sweltering Station, the ill-kempt City, and the undisguised insolence of\n      the Municipality that babbled away the lives of men. Life was cheap,\n      however. The soil spawned humanity, as it bred frogs in the Rains, and the\n      gap of the sickness of one season was filled to overflowing by the\n      fecundity of the next. Otis was unfeignedly thankful to lay down his work\n      for a little while and escape from the seething, whining, weakly hive,\n      impotent to help itself, but strong in its power to cripple, thwart, and\n      annoy the weary-eyed man who, by official irony, was said to be \"in\n      charge\" of it.",
                "\"I knew there were women-dowdies in Bengal. They come up here sometimes.\n      But I didn't know that there were men-dowdies, too.\"",
                "Then, for the first time, it occurred to Otis Yeere that his clothes were\n      rather ancestral in appearance. It will be seen from the above that his\n      friendship with Mrs Hauksbee had made great strides.",
                "As that lady truthfully says, a man is never so happy as when he is\n      talking about himself. From Otis Yeere's lips Mrs Hauksbee, before long,\n      learned everything that she wished to know about the subject of her\n      experiment; learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely\n      called \"those awful cholera districts\"; learned too, but this knowledge\n      came later, what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams he\n      had dreamed in the year of grace '77, before the reality had knocked the\n      heart out of him. Very pleasant are the shady bridle-paths round Prospect\n      Hill for the telling of such confidences.",
                "\"Not yet,\" said Mrs. Hauksbee to Mrs. Mallowe. \"Not yet. I must wait until\n      the man is properly dressed, at least. Great Heavens, is it possible that\n      he doesn't know what an honor it is to be taken up by Me!\"",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee did not reckon false modesty as one of her failings.",
                "\"Always with Mrs. Hauksbee!\" murmured Mrs. Mallowe, with her sweetest\n      smile, to Otis. \"Oh you men, you men! Here are our Punjabis growling\n      because you've monopolized the nicest woman in Simla. They'll tear you to\n      pieces on the Mall, some day, Mr. Yeere.\"",
                "Mrs. Mallowe rattled down-hill, having satisfied herself, by a glance\n      through the fringe of her sunshade, of the effect of her words.",
                "The shot went home. Of a surety Otis Yeere was somebody in this\n      bewildering whirl of Simla -- had monopolized the nicest woman in it\n      and the Punjabis were growling. The notion justified a mild glow of\n      vanity. He had never looked upon his acquaintance with Mrs. Hauksbee as a\n      matter for general interest.",
                "The knowledge of envy was a pleasant feeling to the man of no account. It\n      was intensified later in the day when a luncher at the Club said,\n      spitefully, \"Well, for a debilitated Ditcher, Yeere, you are going it.\n      Hasn't any kind friend told you that she's the most dangerous woman in\n      Simla?\"",
                "Yeere chuckled and passed out. When, oh when, would his new clothes be\n      ready? He descended into the Mall to inquire; and Mrs. Hauksbee, coming\n      over the Church Ridge in her 'rickshaw, looked down upon him approvingly.\n      \"He's learning to carry himself as if he were a man, instead of a piece of\n      furniture, and\" -- she screwed up her eyes to see the better through\n      the sunlight -- \"he is a man when he holds himself like that. Oh\n      blessed Conceit, what should we be without you?\"",
                "With the new clothes came a new stock of self-confidence. Otis Yeere\n      discovered that he could enter a room without breaking into a gentle\n      perspiration -- could cross one, even to talk to Mrs. Hauksbee, as\n      though rooms were meant to be crossed. He was for the first time in nine\n      years proud of himself, and contented with his life, satisfied with his\n      new clothes, and rejoicing in the friendship of Mrs. Hauksbee.",
                "\"Conceit is what the poor fellow wants,\" she said in confidence to Mrs.\n      Mallowe. \"I believe they must use Civilians to plough the fields with in\n      Lower Bengal. You see I have to begin from the very beginning -- haven't\n      I? But you'll admit, won't you, dear, that he is immensely improved since\n      I took him in hand. Only give me a little more time and he won't know\n      himself.\"",
                "Indeed, Yeere was rapidly beginning to forget what he had been. One of his\n      own rank and file put the matter brutally when he asked Yeere, in\n      reference to nothing, \"And who has been making you a Member of Council,\n      lately? You carry the side of half a dozen of 'em.\"",
                "\"I -- I'm awf'ly sorry. I didn't mean it, you know,\" said Yeere,\n      apologetically.",
                "\"There'll be no holding you,\" continued the old stager, grimly. \"Climb\n      down, Otis -- climb down, and get all that beastly affectation knocked\n      out of you with fever! Three thousand a month wouldn't support it.\"",
                "Yeere repeated the incident to Mrs. Hauksbee. He had come to look upon her\n      as his Mother Confessor.",
                "\"And you apologized!\" she said. \"Oh, shame! I hate a man who apologizes.\n      Never apologize for what your friend called 'side.' Never! It's a man's\n      business to be insolent and overbearing until he meets with a stronger.\n      Now, you bad boy, listen to me.\"",
                "Simply and straightforwardly, as the 'rickshaw loitered round Jakko, Mrs.\n      Hauksbee preached to Otis Yeere the Great Gospel of Conceit, illustrating\n      it with living pictures encountered during their Sunday afternoon stroll.",
                "\"Good gracious!\" she ended, with the personal argument, \"you'll apologize\n      next for being my attache?\"",
                "\"Never!\" said Otis Yeere. \"That's another thing altogether. I shall always\n      be\" --",
                "\"What's coming?\" thought Mrs. Hauksbee.",
                "\"Proud of that,\" said Otis.",
                "\"Safe for the present,\" she said to herself.",
                "\"But I'm afraid I have grown conceited. Like Jeshurun, you know. When he\n      waxed fat, then he kicked. It's the having no worry on one's mind and the\n      Hill air, I suppose.\"",
                "\"Hill air, indeed!\" said Mrs. Hauksbee to herself. \"He'd have been hiding\n      in the Club till the last day of his leave, if I hadn't discovered him.\"\n       And aloud -- \"Why shouldn't you be? You have every right to.\"",
                "\"I! Why?\"",
                "\"Oh, hundreds of things. I'm not going to waste this lovely afternoon by\n      explaining; but I know you have. What was that heap of manuscript you\n      showed me about the grammar of the aboriginal -- what's their names?\"",
                "\"Gullals. A piece of nonsense. I've far too much work to do to bother over\n      Gullals now. You should see my District. Come down with your husband some\n      day and I'll show you round. Such a lovely place in the Rains! A sheet of\n      water with the railway-embankment and the snakes sticking out, and, in the\n      summer, green flies and green squash. The people would die of fear if you\n      shook a dogwhip at 'em. But they know you're forbidden to do that, so they\n      conspire to make your life a burden to you. My District's worked by some\n      man at Darjiling, on the strength of u native pleader's false reports. Oh,\n      it's a heavenly place!\"",
                "Otis Yeere laughed bitterly.",
                "\"There's not the least necessity that you should stay in it. Why do you?\"",
                "\"Because I must. How'm I to get out of it?\"",
                "\"How! In a hundred and fifty ways. If there weren't so many people on the\n      road, I'd like to box your ears. Ask, my dear boy, ask! Look, There is\n      young Hexarly with six years' service and half your talents. He asked for\n      what he wanted, and he got it. See, down by the Convent! There's\n      McArthurson who has come to his present position by asking -- sheer,\n      downright asking -- after he had pushed himself out of the rank and\n      file. One man is as good as another in your service -- believe me. I've\n      seen Simla for more seasons than I care to think about. Do you suppose men\n      are chosen for appointments because of their special fitness beforehand?\n      You have all passed a high test -- what do you call it? -- in the\n      beginning, and, except for the few who have gone altogether to the bad,\n      you can all work hard. Asking does the rest. Call it cheek, call it\n      insolence, call it anything you like, but ask! Men argue -- yes, I know\n      what men say -- that a man, by the mere audacity of his request, must\n      have some good in him. A weak man doesn't say: 'Give me this and that.' He\n      whines 'Why haven't I been given this and that?' If you were in the Army,\n      I should say learn to spin plates or play a tambourine with your toes. As\n      it is -- ask! You belong to a Service that ought to be able to command\n      the Channel Fleet, or set a leg at twenty minutes' notice, and yet you\n      hesitate over asking to escape from a squashy green district where you\n      admit you are not master. Drop the Bengal Government altogether. Even\n      Darjiling is a little out-of-the-way hole. I was there once, and the rents\n      were extortionate. Assert yourself. Get the Government of India to take\n      you over. Try to get on the Frontier, where every man has a grand chance\n      if he can trust himself. Go somewhere! Do something! You have twice the\n      wits and three times the presence of the men up here, and, and\" --",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee paused for breath; then continued -- \"and in any way you\n      look at it, you ought to. You who could go so far!\"",
                "\"I don't know,\" said Yeere, rather taken aback by the unexpected\n      eloquence. \"1 haven't such a good opinion of myself.\"",
                "It was not strictly Platonic, but it was Policy. Mrs. Hauksbee laid her\n      hand lightly upon the ungloved paw that rested on the turned-back\n      'rickshaw hood, and, looking the man full in the face, said tenderly,\n      almost too tenderly, \"I believe in you if you mistrust yourself. Is that\n      enough, my friend?\"",
                "\"It is enough,\" answered Otis, very solemnly.",
                "He was silent for a long time, redreaming the dreams that he had dreamed\n      eight years ago, but through them all ran, as sheet-lightning through\n      golden cloud, the light of Mrs. Hauksbee's violet eyes.",
                "Curious and impenetrable are the mazes of Simla life -- the only\n      existence in this desolate land worth the living. Gradually it went abroad\n      among men and women, in the pauses between dance, play and Gymkhana, that\n      Otis Yeere, the man with the newly-lit light of self-confidence in his\n      eyes, had \"done something decent\" in the wilds whence he came. He had\n      brought an erring Municipality to reason, appropriated the funds on his\n      own responsibility, and saved the lives of hundreds, He knew more about\n      the Gullals than any living man. Had a vast knowledge of the aboriginal\n      tribes; was, in spite of his juniority, the greatest authority on the\n      aboriginal Gullals. No one quite knew who or what the Gullals were till\n      The Mussuck, who had been calling on Mrs. Hauksbee, and prided himself\n      upon picking people's brains, explained they were a tribe of ferocious\n      hillmen, somewhere near Sikkim, whose friendship even the Great Indian\n      Empire would find it worth her while to secure. Now we know that Otis\n      Yeere had showed Mrs. Hauksbee his MS notes of six years' standing on the\n      same Gullals. He had told her, too, how, sick and shaken with the fever\n      their negligence had bred, crippled by the loss of his pet clerk, and\n      savagely angry at the desolation in his charge, he had once damned the\n      collective eyes of his \"intelligent local board\" for a set of haramzadas.\n      Which act of \"brutal and tyrannous oppression\" won him a Reprimand Royal\n      from the Bengal Government; but in the anecdote as amended for Northern\n      consumption we find no record of this. Hence we are forced to conclude\n      that Mrs. Hauksbee \"edited\" his reminiscences before sowing them in idle\n      ears, ready, as she well knew, to exaggerate good or evil. And Otis Yeere\n      bore himself as befitted the hero of many tales.",
                "\"You can talk to me when you don't fall into a brown study. Talk now, and\n      talk your brightest and best,\" said Mrs. Hauksbee.",
                "Otis needed no spur. Look to a man who has the counsel of a woman of or\n      above the world to back him. So long as he keeps his head, he can meet\n      both sexes on equal ground -- an advantage never intended by\n      Providence, who fashioned Man on one day and Woman on another, in sign\n      that neither should know more than a very little of the other's life. Such\n      a man goes far, or, the counsel being withdrawn, collapses suddenly while\n      his world seeks the reason.",
                "Generalled by Mrs. Hauksbee who, again, had all Mrs. Mallowe's wisdom at\n      her disposal, proud of himself and, in the end, believing in himself\n      because he was believed in, Otis Yeere stood ready for any fortune that\n      might befall, certain that it would be good. He would fight for his own\n      hand, and intended that this second struggle should lead to better issue\n      than the first helpless surrender of the bewildered 'Stunt.",
                "What might have happened, it is impossible to say. This lamentable thing\n      befell, bred directly by a statement of Mrs. Hauksbee that she would spend\n      the next season in Darjiling.",
                "\"Are you certain of that?\" said Otis Yeere.",
                "\"Quite. We're writing about a house now.\"",
                "Otis Yeere \"stopped dead,\" as Mrs. Hauksbee put it in discussing the\n      relapse with Mrs. Mallowe.",

I'd have changed the\n      Station and lost the rent to have saved this. He said, in so many words,\n      that he wasn't going to try to work up any more, because -- because he\n      would be shifted into a province away from Darjiling, and his own\n      District, where these creatures are, is within a day's journey\" --",

Protect my character,\n      dear, if it's all over Simla by tomorrow -- and then he bobbed forward\n      in the middle of this insanity -- I firmly believe the man's demented -- and\n      kissed me!\"",

                "Once upon a time there was a man and his Wife and a Tertium Quid.",
                "All three were unwise, but the Wife was the unwisest. The Man should have\n      looked after his Wife, who should have avoided the Tertium Quid, who,\n      again, should have married a wife of his own, after clean and open\n      flirtations, to which nobody can possibly object, round Jakko or\n      Observatory Hill. When you see a young man with his pony in a white\n      lather, and his hat on the back of his head flying down-hill at fifteen\n      miles an hour to meet a girl who will be properly surprised to meet him,\n      you naturally approve of that young man, and wish him Staff Appointments,\n      and take an interest in his welfare, and, as the proper time comes, give\n      them sugar-tongs or side-saddles, according to your means and generosity.",
                "The Tertium Quid flew down-hill on horseback, but it was to meet the Man's\n      Wife; and when he flew up-hill it was for the same end. The Man was in the\n      Plains, earning money for his Wife to spend on dresses and\n      four-hundred-rupee bracelets, and inexpensive luxuries of that kind. He\n      worked very hard, and sent her a letter or a post-card daily. She also\n      wrote to him daily, and said that she was longing for him to come up to\n      Simla. The Tertium Quid used to lean over her shoulder and laugh as she\n      wrote the notes. Then the two would ride to the Post Office together.",
                "Now, Simla is a strange place and its customs are peculiar; nor is any man\n      who has not spent at least ten seasons there qualified to pass judgment on\n      circumstantial evidence, which is the most untrustworthy in the Courts.\n      For these reasons, and for others which need not appear, I decline to\n      state positively whether there was anything irretrievably wrong in the\n      relations between the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid. If there was, and\n      hereon you must form your own opinion, it was the Man's Wife's fault. She\n      was kittenish in her manners, wearing generally an air of soft and fluffy\n      innocence. But she was deadly learned and evil-instructed; and, now and\n      again, when the mask dropped, men saw this, shuddered and almost drew\n      back. Men are occasionally particular, and the least particular men are\n      always the most exacting.",
                "Simla is eccentric in its fashion of tearing friendships. Certain\n      attachments which have set and crystallized through half a dozen seasons\n      acquire almost the sanctity of the marriage bond, and are revered as such.\n      Again, certain attachments equally old, and, to all appearance, equally\n      venerable, never seem to win any recognized official status; while a\n      chance-sprung acquaintance now two months born, steps into the place which\n      by right belongs to the senior. There is no law reducible to print which\n      regulates these affairs.",
                "Some people have a gift which secures them infinite toleration, and others\n      have not. The Man's Wife had not. If she looked over the garden wall, for\n      instance, women taxed her with stealing their husbands. She complained\n      pathetically that she was not allowed to choose her own friends. When she\n      put up her big white muff to her lips, and gazed over it and under her\n      eyebrows at you as she said this thing, you felt that she had been\n      infamously misjudged, and that all the other women's instincts were all\n      wrong; which was absurd. She was not allowed to own the Tertium Quid in\n      peace; and was so strangely constructed that she would not have enjoyed\n      peace had she been so permitted. She preferred some semblance of intrigue\n      to cloak even her most commonplace actions.",
                "After two months of riding, first round Jakko, then Elysium, then Summer\n      Hill, then Observatory Hill, then under Jutogh, and lastly up and down the\n      Cart Road as far as the Tara Devi gap in the dusk, she said to the Tertium\n      Quid, \"Frank, people say we are too much together, and people are so\n      horrid.\"",
                "The Tertium Quid pulled his moustache, and replied that horrid people were\n      unworthy of the consideration of nice people.",
                "\"But they have done more than talk -- they have written -- written\n      to my hubby -- I'm sure of it,\" said the Man's Wife, and she pulled a\n      letter from her husband out of her saddle-pocket and gave it to the\n      Tertium Quid.",
                "It was an honest letter, written by an honest man, then stewing in the\n      Plains on two hundred rupees a month (for he allowed his wife eight\n      hundred and fifty), and in a silk banian and cotton trousers. It is said\n      that, perhaps, she had no thought of the unwisdom of allowing her name to\n      be so generally coupled with the Tertium Quid's; that she was too much of\n      a child to understand the dangers of that sort of thing; that he, her\n      husband, was the last man in the world to interfere jealously with her\n      little amusements and interests, but that it would be better were she to\n      drop the Tertium Quid quietly and for her husband's sake. The letter was\n      sweetened with many pretty little pet names, and it amused the Tertium\n      Quid considerably. He and She laughed over it, so that you, fifty yards\n      away, could see their shoulders shaking while the horses slouched along\n      side by side.",
                "Their conversation was not worth reporting. The upshot of it was that,\n      next day, no one saw the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid together. They\n      had both gone down to the Cemetery, which, as a rule, is only visited\n      officially by the inhabitants of Simla.",
                "A Simla funeral with the clergyman riding, the mourners riding, and the\n      coffin creaking as it swings between the bearers, is one of the most\n      depressing things on this earth, particularly when the procession passes\n      under the wet, dank dip beneath the Rockcliffe Hotel, where the sun is\n      shut out and all the hill streams are wailing and weeping together as they\n      go down the valleys.",
                "Occasionally folk tend the graves, but we in India shift and are\n      transferred so often that, at the end of the second year, the Dead have no\n      friends -- only acquaintances who are far too busy amusing themselves\n      up the hill to attend to old partners. The idea of using a Cemetery as a\n      rendezvous is distinctly a feminine one. A man would have said simply \"Let\n      people talk. We'll go down the Mall.\" A woman is made differently,\n      especially if she be such a woman as the Man's Wife. She and the Tertium\n      Quid enjoyed each other's society among the graves of men and women whom\n      they had known and danced with aforetime.",
                "They used to take a big horse-blanket and sit on the grass a little to the\n      left of the lower end, where there is a dip in the ground and where the\n      occupied graves stop short and the ready-made ones are not ready. Each\n      well-regulated India Cemetery keeps half a dozen graves permanently open\n      for contingencies and incidental wear and tear. In the Hills these are\n      more usually baby's size, because children who come up weakened and sick\n      from the Plains often succumb to the effects of the Rains in the Hills or\n      get pneumonia from their ayahs taking them through damp pine-woods after\n      the sun has set. In Cantonments, of course, the man's size is more in\n      request; these arrangements varying with the climate and population.",
                "One day when the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid had just arrived in the\n      Cemetery, they saw some coolies breaking ground. They had marked out a\n      full-size grave, and the Tertium Quid asked them whether any Sahib was\n      sick. They said that they did not know; but it was an order that they\n      should dig a Sahib's grave.",
                "\"Work away,\" said the Tertium Quid, \"and let's see how it's done.\"",
                "The coolies worked away, and the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid watched\n      and talked for a couple of hours while the grave was being deepened Then a\n      coolie, taking the earth in blankets as it was thrown up, jumped over the\n      grave.",
                "\"That's queer,\" said the Tertium Quid. \"Where's my ulster?\"",
                "\"What's queer?\" said the Man's Wife.",
                "\"I have got a chill down my back just as if a goose had walked over my\n      grave.\"",
                "\"Why do you look at the thing, then?\" said the Man's Wife. \"Let us go.\"",
                "The Tertium Quid stood at the head of the grave, and stared without\n      answering for a space. Then he said, dropping a pebble down, \"It is nasty\n      and cold; horribly cold. I don't think I shall come to the Cemetery any\n      more. I don't think grave-digging is cheerful.\"",
                "The two talked and agreed that the Cemetery was depressing. They also\n      arranged for a ride next day out from the Cemetery through the Mashobra\n      Tunnel up to Fagoo and back, because all the world was going to a\n      garden-party at Viceregal Lodge, and all the people of Mashobra would go\n      too.",
                "Coming up the Cemetery road, the Tertium Quid's horse tried to bolt up\n      hill, being tired with standing so long, and managed to strain a back\n      sinew.",
                "\"I shall have to take the mare tomorrow,\" said the Tertium Quid, \"and she\n      will stand nothing heavier than a snaffle.\"",
                "They made their arrangements to meet in the Cemetery, after allowing all\n      the Mashobra people time to pass into Simla. That night it rained heavily,\n      and next day, when the Tertium Quid came to the trysting-place, he saw\n      that the new grave had a foot of water in it, the ground being a tough and\n      sour clay.",
                "\"'Jove! That looks beastly,\" said the Tertium Quid. \"Fancy being boarded\n      up and dropped into that well!\"",
                "They then started off to Fagoo, the mare playing with the snaffle and\n      picking her way as though she were shod with satin, and the sun shining\n      divinely. The road below Mashobra to Fagoo is officially styled the\n      Himalayan-Thibet Road; but in spite of its name it is not much more than\n      six feet wide in most places, and the drop into the valley below must be\n      anything between one and two thousand feet.",
                "\"Now we're going to Thibet,\" said the Man's Wife merrily, as the horses\n      drew near to Fagoo. She was riding on the cliff-side.",
                "\"Into Thibet,\" said the Tertium Quid, \"ever so far from people who say\n      horrid things, and hubbies who write stupid letters. With you -- to the\n      end of the world!\"",
                "A coolie carrying a log of wood came round a corner, and the mare went\n      wide to avoid him -- forefeet in and haunches out, as a sensible mare\n      should go.",
                "\"To the world's end,\" said the Man's Wife, and looked unspeakable things\n      over her near shoulder at the Tertium Quid.",
                "He was smiling, but, while she looked, the smile froze stiff as it were on\n      his face, and changed to a nervous grin -- the sort of grin men wear\n      when they are not quite easy in their saddles. The mare seemed to be\n      sinking by the stem, and her nostrils cracked while she was trying to\n      realize what was happening. The rain of the night before had rotted the\n      drop-side of the Himalayan-Thibet Road, and it was giving way under her.\n      \"What are you doing?\" said the Man's Wife. The Tertium Quid gave no\n      answer. He grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare, who rapped\n      with her forefeet on the road, and the struggle began. The Man's Wife\n      screamed, \"Oh, Frank, get off!\"",
                "But the Tertium Quid was glued to the saddle -- his face blue and white -- and\n      he looked into the Man's Wife's eyes. Then the Man's Wife clutched at the\n      mare's head and caught her by the nose instead of the bridle. The brute\n      threw up her head and went down with a scream, the Tertium Quid upon her,\n      and the nervous grin still set on his face.",
                "The Man's Wife heard the tinkle-tinkle of little stones and loose earth\n      falling off the roadway, and the sliding roar of the man and horse going\n      down. Then everything was quiet, and she called on Frank to leave his mare\n      and walk up. But Frank did not answer. He was underneath the mare, nine\n      hundred feet below, spoiling a patch of Indian corn.",
                "As the revellers came back from Viceregal Lodge in the mists of the\n      evening, they met a temporarily insane woman, on a temporarily mad horse,\n      swinging round the corners, with her eyes and her mouth open, and her head\n      like the head of the Medusa. She was stopped by a man at the risk of his\n      life, and taken out of the saddle, a limp heap, and put on the bank to\n      explain herself. This wasted twenty minutes, and then she was sent home in\n      a lady's 'rickshaw, still with her mouth open and her hands picking at her\n      riding-gloves.",
                "She was in bed through the following three days, which were rainy; so she\n      missed attending the funeral of the Tertium Quid, who was lowered into\n      eighteen inches of water, instead of the twelve to which he had first\n      objected."

                "Kashima is bound on all sides by the rock-tipped circle of the Dosehri\n      hills. In Spring, it is ablaze with roses; in Summer, the roses die and\n      the hot winds blow from the hills; in Autumn, the white mists from the\n      hills cover the place as with water; and in Winter the frosts nip\n      everything young and tender to earth-level. There is but one view in\n      Kashima -- a stretch of perfectly flat pasture and plough-land, running\n      up to the grey-blue scrub of the Dosehri hills.",

Narkarra -- one hundred and forty-three\n      miles by road -- is the nearest station to Kashima. But Kashima never\n      goes to Narkarra, where there are at least twelve English people.

                "There was deep peace in Kashima till Mrs. Vansuythen arrived. She was a\n      charming woman, every one said so everywhere; and she charmed every one.\n      In spite of this, or, perhaps, because of this, since Fate is so perverse,\n      she cared only for one man, and he was Major Vansuythen. Had she been\n      plain or stupid, this matter would have been intelligible to Kashima. But\n      she was a fair woman, with very still grey eyes, the color of a lake just\n      before the light of the sun touches it. No man who had seen those eyes,\n      could, later on, explain what fashion of woman she was to look upon. The\n      eyes dazzled him. Her own sex said that she was \"not bad looking, but\n      spoiled by pretending to be so grave.\" And yet her gravity was natural It\n      was not her habit to smile. She merely went through life, looking at those\n      who passed; and the women objected while the men fell down and worshipped.",
                "She knows and is deeply sorry for the evil she has done to Kashima; but\n      Major Vansuythen cannot understand why Mrs. Boulte does not drop in to\n      afternoon tea at least three times a week. \"When there are only two women\n      in one Station, they ought to see a great deal of each other,\" says Major\n      Vansuythen.",
                "Long and long before ever Mrs. Vansuythen came out of those far-away\n      places where there is society and amusement, Kurrell had discovered that\n      Mrs. Boulte was the one woman in the world for him and -- you dare not\n      blame them. Kashima was as out of the world as Heaven or the Other Place,\n      and the Dosehri hills kept their secret well. Boulte had no concern in the\n      matter. He was in camp for a fortnight at a time. He was a hard, heavy\n      man, and neither Mrs. Boulte nor Kurrell pitied him. They had all Kashima\n      and each other for their very, very own; and Kashima was the Garden of\n      Eden in those days. When Boulte returned from his wanderings he would slap\n      Kurrell between the shoulders and call him \"old fellow,\" and the three\n      would dine together. Kashima was happy then when the judgment of God\n      seemed almost as distant as Narkarra or the railway that ran down to the\n      sea. But the Government sent Major Vansuythen to Kashima, and with him\n      came his wife.",
                "The etiquette of Kashima is much the same as that of a desert island. When\n      a stranger is cast away there, all hands go down to the shore to make him\n      welcome. Kashima assembled at the masonry platform close to the Narkarra\n      Road, and spread tea for the Vansuythens. That ceremony was reckoned a\n      formal call, and made them free of the Station, its rights and privileges.\n      When the Vansuythens were settled down, they gave a tiny housewarming to\n      all Kashima; and that made Kashima free of their house, according to the\n      immemorial usage of the Station.",
                "Then the Rains came, when no one could go into camp, and the Narkarra Road\n      was washed away by the Kasun River, and in the cup-like pastures of\n      Kashima the cattle waded knee-deep. The clouds dropped down from the\n      Dosehri hills and covered everything.",
                "At the end of the Rains, Boulte's manner toward his wife changed and\n      became demonstratively affectionate. They had been married twelve years,\n      and the change startled Mrs. Boulte, who hated her husband with the hate\n      of a woman who has met with nothing but kindness from her mate, and, in\n      the teeth of this kindness, had done him a great wrong. Moreover, she had\n      her own trouble to fight with -- her watch to keep over her own\n      property, Kurrell. For two months the Rains had hidden the Dosehri hills\n      and many other things besides; but when they lifted, they showed Mrs.\n      Boulte that her man among men, her Ted -- for she called him Ted in the\n      old days when Boulte was out of earshot -- was slipping the links of\n      the allegiance.",
                "\"The Vansuythen Woman has taken him,\" Mrs. Boulte said to herself; and\n      when Boulte was away, wept over her belief, in the face of the\n      over-vehement blandishments of Ted. Sorrow in Kashima is as fortunate as\n      Love, because there is nothing to weaken it save the flight of Time. Mrs.\n      Boulte had never breathed her suspicion to Kurrell because she was not\n      certain; and her nature led her to be very certain before she took steps\n      in any direction. That is why she behaved as she did.",
                "Boulte came into the house one evening, and leaned against the door-posts\n      of the drawing-room, chewing his moustache. Mrs. Boulte was putting some\n      flowers into a vase. There is a pretence of civilization even in Kashima.",
                "\"Little woman,\" said Boulte, quietly, \"do you care for me?\"",
                "\"Immensely,\" said she, with a laugh. \"Can you ask it?\"",
                "\"But I'm serious,\" said Boulte. \"Do you care for me?\"",
                "Mrs. Boulte dropped the flowers, and turned round quickly. \"Do you want an\n      honest answer?\"",
                "\"Ye-es, I've asked for it.\"",
                "Mrs. Boulte spoke in a low, even voice for five minutes, very distinctly,\n      that there might be no misunderstanding her meaning. When Samson broke the\n      pillars of Gaza, he did a little thing, and one not to be compared to the\n      deliberate pulling down of a woman's homestead about her own ears. There\n      was no wise female friend to advise Mrs. Boulte, the singularly cautious\n      wife, to hold her hand. She struck at Boulte's heart, because her own was\n      sick with suspicion of Kurrell, and worn out with the long strain of\n      watching alone through the Rains. There was no plan or purpose in her\n      speaking. The sentences made themselves; and Boulte listened leaning\n      against the door-post with his hands in his pockets. When all was over,\n      and Mrs. Boulte began to breathe through her nose before breaking out into\n      tears, he laughed and stared straight in front of him at the Dosehri\n      hills.",
                "\"Is that all?\" he said. \"Thanks, I only wanted to know, you know.\"",
                "\"What are you going to do?\" said the woman, between her sobs.",
                "\"Do! Nothing. What should I do? Kill Kurrell or send you Home, or apply\n      for leave to get a divorce? It's two days' dak into Narkarra.\" He laughed\n      again and went on: \"I'll tell you what you can do. You can ask Kurrell to\n      dinner tomorrow -- no, on Thursday, that will allow you time to pack -- and\n      you can bolt with him. I give you my word I won't follow.\"",
                "He took up his helmet and went out of the room, and Mrs. Boulte sat till\n      the moonlight streaked the floor, thinking and thinking and thinking. She\n      had done her best upon the spur of the moment to pull the house down; but\n      it would not fall. Moreover, she could not understand her husband, and she\n      was afraid. Then the folly of her useless truthfulness struck her, and she\n      was ashamed to write to Kurrell, saying: \"I have gone mad and told\n      everything. My husband says that I am free to elope with you. Get a dak\n      for Thursday, and we will fly after dinner.\" There was a cold-bloodedness\n      about that procedure which did not appeal to her. So she sat still in her\n      own house and thought.",
                "At dinner-time Boulte came back from his walk, white and worn and haggard,\n      and the woman was touched at his distress. As the evening wore on, she\n      muttered some expression of sorrow, something approaching to contrition.\n      Boulte came out of a brown study and said, \"Oh, that! I wasn't thinking\n      about that. By the way, what does Kurrell say to the elopement?\"",
                "\"I haven't seen him,\" said Mrs. Boulte. \"Good God! is that all?\"",
                "But Boulte was not listening, and her sentence ended in a gulp.",
                "The next day brought no comfort to Mrs. Boulte, for Kurrell did not\n      appear, and the new life that she, in the five minutes' madness of the\n      previous evening, had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old, seemed\n      to be no nearer.",
                "Boulte ate his breakfast, advised her to see her Arab pony fed in the\n      veranda, and went out. The morning wore through, and at midday the tension\n      became unendurable. Mrs. Boulte could not cry. She had finished her crying\n      in the night, and now she did not want to be left alone. Perhaps the\n      Vansuythen woman would talk to her; and, since talking opens the heart,\n      perhaps there might be some comfort to be found in her company. She was\n      the only other woman in the Station.",
                "In Kashima there are no regular calling-hours. Every one can drop in upon\n      every one else at pleasure. Mrs. Boulte put on a big terai hat, and walked\n      across to the Vansuythens's house to borrow last week's Queen. The two\n      compounds touched, and instead of going up the drive, she crossed through\n      the gap in the cactus-hedge, entering the house from the back. As she\n      passed through the dining-room, she heard, behind the purdah that cloaked\n      the drawing-room door, her husband's voice, saying -- \"But on my Honor!\n      On my Soul and Honor, I tell you she doesn't care for me. She told me so\n      last night. I would have told you then if Vansuythen hadn't been with you.\n      If it is for her sake that you'll have nothing to say to me, you can make\n      your mind easy. It's Kurrell.\"",
                "\"What?\" said Mrs. Vansuythen, with an hysterical little laugh. \"Kurrell!\n      Oh, it can't be. You two must have made some horrible mistake. Perhaps you -- you\n      lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't be as wrong\n      as you say.\"",
                "Mrs. Vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the man's pleading, and\n      was desperately trying to keep him to a side-issue.",
                "\"There must be some mistake,\" she insisted, \"and it can be all put right\n      again.\"",
                "Boulte laughed grimly.",
                "\"It can't be Captain Kurrell! He told me that he had never taken the least -- the\n      least interest in your wife, Mr. Boulte. Oh, do listen! He said he had\n      not. He swore he had not,\" said Mrs. Vansuythen.",
                "The purdah rustled, and the speech was cut short by the entry of a little,\n      thin woman with big rings round her eyes. Mrs. Vansuythen stood up with a\n      gasp.",
                "\"What was that you said?\" asked Mrs. Boulte. \"Never mind that man. What\n      did Ted say to you? What did he say to you? What did he say to you?\"",
                "Mrs. Vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa, overborne by the trouble\n      of her questioner.",
                "\"He said -- I can't remember exactly what he said -- but I\n      understood him to say -- that is -- But, really, Mrs. Boulte, isn't\n      it rather a strange question?\"",
                "\"Will you tell me what he said?\" repeated Mrs. Boulte.",
                "Even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps, and Mrs.\n      Vansuythen was only an ordinarily good woman. She began in a sort of\n      desperation: \"Well, he said that he never cared for you at all, and, of\n      course, there was not the least reason why he should have, and -- and -- that\n      was all.\"",
                "\"You said he swore he had not cared for me. Was that true?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Vansuythen, very softly.",
                "Mrs. Boulte wavered for an instant where she stood, and then fell forward\n      fainting.",
                "\"What did I tell you?\" said Boulte, as though the conversation had been\n      unbroken. \"You can see for yourself she cares for him.\" The light began to\n      break into his dull mind, and he went on -- \"And he -- what was he\n      saying to you?\"",
                "But Mrs. Vansuythen, with no heart for explanations or impassioned\n      protestations, was kneeling over Mrs. Boulte.",
                "\"Oh, you brute!\" she cried. \"Are all men like this? Help me to get her\n      into my room -- and her face is cut against the table. Oh, will you be\n      quiet, and help me to carry her? I hate you, and I hate Captain Kurrell.\n      Lift her up carefully and now -- go! Go away!\"",
                "Boulte carried his wife into Mrs. Vansuythen's bedroom and departed before\n      the storm of that lady's wrath and disgust, impenitent and burning with\n      jealousy. Kurrell had been making love to Mrs. Vansuythen -- would do\n      Vansuythen as great a wrong as he had done Boulte, who caught himself\n      considering whether Mrs. Vansuythen would faint if she discovered that the\n      man she loved had foresworn her.",
                "In the middle of these meditations, Kurrell came cantering along the road\n      and pulled up with a cheery, \"Good mornin'. 'Been mashing Mrs. Vansuythen\n      as usual, eh? Bad thing for a sober, married man, that. What will Mrs\n      Boulte say?\"",
                "Boulte raised his head and said, slowly, \"Oh, you liar!\"",
                "Kurrell's face changed. \"What's that?\" he asked, quickly.",
                "\"Nothing much,\" said Boulte. \"Has my wife told you that you two are free\n      to go off whenever you please? She has been good enough to explain the\n      situation to me. You've been a true friend to me, Kurrell -- old man -- haven't\n      you?\"",
                "Kurrell groaned, and tried to frame some sort of idiotic sentence about\n      being willing to give \"satisfaction.\" But his interest in the woman was\n      dead, had died out in the Rains, and, mentally, he was abusing her for her\n      amazing indiscretion. It would have been so easy to have broken off the\n      thing gently and by degrees, and now he was saddled with -- Boulte's\n      voice recalled him.",
                "\"I don't think I should get any satisfaction from killing you, and I'm\n      pretty sure you'd get none from killing me.\"",
                "Then in a querulous tone, ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs,\n      Boulte added -- \"'Seems rather a pity that you haven't the decency to\n      keep to the woman, now you've got her. You've been a true friend to her\n      too, haven't you?\"",
                "Kurrell stared long and gravely. The situation was getting beyond him.",
                "\"What do you mean?\" he said.",
                "Boulte answered, more to himself than the questioner: \"My wife came over\n      to Mrs. Vansuythen's just now; and it seems you'd been telling Mrs.\n      Vansuythen that you'd never cared for Emma. I suppose you lied, as usual.\n      What had Mrs. Vansuythen to do with you, or you with her? Try to speak the\n      truth for once in a way.\"",
                "Kurrell took the double insult without wincing, and replied by another\n      question: \"Go on. What happened?\"",
                "\"Emma fainted,\" said Boulte, simply. \"But, look here, what had you been\n      saying to Mrs. Vansuythen?\"",
                "Kurrell laughed. Mrs. Boulte had, with unbridled tongue, made havoc of his\n      plans; and he could at least retaliate by hurting the man in whose eyes he\n      was humiliated and shown dishonorable.",
                "\"Said to her? What does a man tell a lie like that for? I suppose I said\n      pretty much what you've said, unless I'm a good deal mistaken.\"",
                "\"I spoke the truth,\" said Boulte, again more to himself than Kurrell.\n      \"Emma told me she hated me. She has no right in me.\"",
                "\"No! I suppose not. You're only her husband, y'know. And what did Mrs.\n      Vansuythen say after you had laid your disengaged heart at her feet?\"",
                "Kurrell felt almost virtuous as he put the question.",
                "\"I don't think that matters,\" Boulte replied; \"and it doesn't concern\n      you.\"",
                "\"But it does! I tell you it does\" began Kurrell, shamelessly.",
                "The sentence was cut by a roar of laughter from Boulte's lips. Kurrell was\n      silent for an instant, and then he, too, laughed -- laughed long and\n      loudly, rocking in his saddle. It was an unpleasant sound -- the\n      mirthless mirth of these men on the long, white line of the Narkarra Road.\n      There were no strangers in Kashima, or they might have thought that\n      captivity within the Dosehri hills had driven half the European population\n      mad. The laughter ended abruptly, and Kurrell was the first to speak.",
                "\"Well, what are you going to do?\"",
                "Boulte looked up the road, and at the hills. \"Nothing,\" said he, quietly;\n      \"what's the use? It's too ghastly for anything. We must let the old life\n      go on. I can only call you a hound and a liar, and I can't go on calling\n      you names forever. Besides which, I don't feel that I'm much better. We\n      can't get out of this place. What is there to do?\"",
                "Kurrell looked round the rat-pit of Kashima and made no reply. The injured\n      husband took up the wondrous tale.",
                "\"Ride on, and speak to Emma if you want to. God knows I don't care what\n      you do.\"",
                "He walked forward and left Kurrell gazing blankly after him. Kurrell did\n      not ride on either to see Mrs. Boulte or Mrs. Vansuythen. He sat in his\n      saddle and thought, while his pony grazed by the roadside.",
                "The whir of approaching wheels roused him. Mrs. Vansuythen was driving\n      home Mrs. Boulte, white and wan, with a cut on her forehead.",
                "\"Stop, please,\" said Mrs. Boulte \"I want to speak to Ted.\"",
                "Mrs. Vansuythen obeyed, but as Mrs. Boulte leaned forward, putting her\n      hand upon the splash-board of the dog-cart, Kurrell spoke.",
                "\"I've seen your husband, Mrs. Boulte.\"",
                "There was no necessity for any further explanation. The man's eyes were\n      fixed, not upon Mrs. Boulte, but her companion. Mrs. Boulte saw the look.",
                "\"Speak to him!\" she pleaded, turning to the woman at her side. \"Oh, speak\n      to him! Tell him what you told me just now. Tell him you hate him. Tell\n      him you hate him!\"",
                "She bent forward and wept bitterly, while the sais, impassive, went\n      forward to hold the horse. Mrs. Vansuythen turned scarlet and dropped the\n      reins. She wished to be no party to such unholy explanations.",
                "\"I've nothing to do with it,\" she began, coldly; but Mrs. Boulte's sobs\n      overcame her, and she addressed herself to the man. \"I don't know what I\n      am to say, Captain Kurrell. I don't know what I can call you. I think\n      you've -- you've behaved abominably, and she has cut her forehead\n      terribly against the table.\"",
                "\"It doesn't hurt. It isn't anything,\" said Mrs. Boulte feebly. \"That\n      doesn't matter. Tell him what you told me. Say you don't care for him. Oh,\n      Ted, won't you believe her?\"",
                "\"Mrs. Boulte has made me understand that you were -- that you were fond\n      of her once upon a time,\" went on Mrs. Vansuythen.",
                "\"Well!\" said Kurrell brutally. \"It seems to me that Mrs. Boulte had better\n      be fond of her own husband first.\"",
                "\"Stop!\" said Mrs. Vansuythen. \"Hear me first. I don't care -- I don't\n      want to know anything about you and Mrs. Boulte; but I want you to know\n      that I hate you, that I think you are a cur, and that I'll never, never\n      speak to you again. Oh, I don't dare to say what I think of you, you -- man!\n      Sais, gorah ko jane do.\"",
                "\"I want to speak to Ted,\" moaned Mrs. Boulte, but the dog-cart rattled on,\n      and Kurrell was left on the road, shamed, and boiling with wrath against\n      Mrs. Boulte.",
                "He waited till Mrs. Vansuythen was driving back to her own house, and, she\n      being freed from the embarrassment of Mrs. Boulte's presence, learned for\n      the second time her opinion of himself and his actions.",
                "In the evenings, it was the wont of all Kashima to meet at the platform on\n      the Narkarra Road, to drink tea, and discuss the trivialities of the day.\n      Major Vansuythen and his wife found themselves alone at the\n      gathering-place for almost the first time in their remembrance; and the\n      cheery Major, in the teeth of his wife's remarkably reasonable suggestion\n      that the rest of the Station might be sick, insisted upon driving round to\n      the two bungalows and unearthing the population.",
                "\"Sitting in the twilight!\" said he, with great indignation to the Boultes.\n      \"That'll never do! Hang it all, we're one family here! You must come out,\n      and so must Kurrell. I'll make him bring his banjo.\" So great is the power\n      of honest simplicity and a good digestion over guilty consciences that all\n      Kashima did turn out, even down to the banjo; and the Major embraced the\n      company in one expansive grin. As he grinned, Mrs. Vansuythen raised her\n      eyes for an instant and looked at all Kashima. Her meaning was clear.\n      Major Vansuythen would never know anything. He was to be the outsider in\n      that happy family whose cage was the Dosehri hills.",
                "\"You're singing villainously out of tune, Kurrell,\" said the Major,\n      truthfully. \"Pass me that banjo.\"",
                "And he sang in excruciating-wise till the stars came out and all Kashima\n      went to dinner.",
                "That was the beginning of the New Life of Kashima -- the life that Mrs.\n      Boulte made when her tongue was loosened in the twilight.",
                "Mrs. Vansuythen has never told the Major; and since be insists upon\n      keeping up a burdensome geniality, she has been compelled to break her vow\n      of not speaking to Kurrell. This speech, which must of necessity preserve\n      the semblance of politeness and interest, serves admirably to keep alive\n      the flame of jealousy and dull hatred in Boulte's bosom, as it awakens the\n      same passions in his wife's heart. Mrs. Boulte hates Mrs. Vansuythen\n      because she has taken Ted from her, and, in some curious fashion, hates\n      her because Mrs. Vansuythen -- and here the wife's eyes see far more\n      clearly than the husband's -- detests Ted. And Ted -- that gallant\n      captain and honorable man -- knows now that it is possible to hate a\n      woman once loved, to the verge of wishing to silence her forever with\n      blows. Above all, is he shocked that Mrs. Boulte cannot see the error of\n      her ways.",
                "Boulte and he go out tiger-shooting together in all friendship. Boulte has\n      put their relationship on a most satisfactory footing.",
                "\"You're a blackguard,\" he says to Kurrell, \"and I've lost any self-respect\n      I may ever have had; but when you're with me, I can feel certain that you\n      are not with Mrs. Vansuythen, or making Emma miserable.\"",
                "Kurrell endures anything that Boulte may say to him. Sometimes they are\n      away for three days together, and then the Major insists upon his wife\n      going over to sit with Mrs. Boulte; although Mrs. Vansuythen has\n      repeatedly declared that she prefers her husband's company to any in the\n      world. From the way in which she clings to him, she would certainly seem\n      to be speaking the truth.",
                "But of course, as the Major says, \"in a little Station we must all be\n      friendly.\""

Tonga in the early morning -- reach Kalka at twelve -- Umballa\n      at seven -- down, straight by night train, to Bombay, and then the\n      steamer of the 21st for Rome. That's my idea.

                "HE. What's the good? There's a cloud on Elysium Hill, and that means it's\n      foggy all down the Mall. We'll go on. It'll blow away before we get to the\n      Convent, perhaps. 'Jove! It is chilly.",
                "SHE. You feel it, fresh from below. Put on your ulster. What do you think\n      of my cape?",
                "HE. Never ask a man his opinion of a woman's dress when he is desperately\n      and abjectly in love with the wearer. Let me look. Like everything else of\n      yours it's perfect. Where did you get it from?",

                "HE. Look here, Sweetheart, I didn't spend two days and two nights in the\n      train to hear you wonder. I thought we'd settled all that at Shaifazehat.",
                "SHE (dreamily). At Shaifazehat? Does the Station go on still? That was\n      ages and ages ago. It must be crumbling to pieces. All except the\n      Amirtollah kutcha road. I don't believe that could crumble till the Day of\n      Judgment.",
                "Ha. You think so? What is the mood now?",
                "SHE. I can't tell. How cold it is! Let us get on quickly.",
                "Ha. Better walk a little. Stop your jhampanis and get out. What's the\n      matter with you this evening, dear?",
                "SHE. Nothing. You must grow accustomed to my ways. If I'm boring you I can\n      go home. Here's Captain Congleton coming; I dare say he'll be willing to\n      escort me.",
                "Ha. Goose! Between us, too! Damn Captain Congleton. There!",
                "SHE. Chivalrous Knight! Is it your habit to swear much in talking? It jars\n      a little, and you might swear at me.",
                "HE. My angel! I didn't know what I was saying; and you changed so quickly\n      that I couldn't follow. I'll apologize in dust and ashes.",
                "SHE. There'll be enough of those later on. Good night, Captain Congleton.\n      Going to the singing-quadrilles already? What dances am I giving you next\n      week? No! You must have written them down wrong. Five and Seven, I said.\n      If you've made a mistake, I certainly don't intend to suffer for it. You\n      must alter your programme.",
                "HE. I thought you told me that you had not been going out much this\n      season?",
                "SHE. Quite true, but when I do I dance with Captain Congleton. He dances\n      very nicely.",
                "HE. And sit out with him, I suppose?",
                "SHE. Yes. Have you any objection? Shall I stand under the chandelier in\n      future?",
                "HE. What does he talk to you about?",
                "SHE. What do men talk about when they sit out?",
                "Ha. Ugh! Don't! Well now I'm up, you must dispense with the fascinating\n      Congleton for a while. I don't like him.",
                "SHE. (after a pause). Do you know what you have said?",
                "HE. 'Can't say that I do exactly. I'm not in the best of tempers.",
                "SHE. So I see... and feel. My true and faithful lover, where is your\n      \"eternal constancy,\" \"unalterable trust,\" and \"reverent devotion\"? I\n      remember those phrases; you seem to have forgotten them. I mention a man's\n      name --",
                "HE. A good deal more than that.",
                "SHE. Well, speak to him about a dance -- perhaps the last dance that I\n      shall ever dance in my life before I... before I go away; and you at once\n      distrust and insult me.",
                "HE. I never said a word.",
                "SHE. How much did you imply? Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our\n      stock to start the new life on?",
                "HE. No, of course not. I didn't mean that. On my word of honor, I didn't.\n      Let it pass, dear. Please let it pass.",
                "SHE. This once -- yes -- and a second time, and again and again, all\n      through the years when I shall be unable to resent it. You want too much,\n      my Lancelot, and... you know too much.",
                "HE. How do you mean?",
                "SHE. That is a part of the punishment. There cannot be perfect trust\n      between us.",
                "HE. In Heaven's name, why not?",
                "SHE. Hush! The Other Place is quite enough. Ask yourself.",
                "HE. I don't follow.",
                "SHE. You trust me so implicitly that when I look at another man -- Never\n      mind, Guy. Have you ever made love to a girl -- a good girl?",
                "HE. Something of the sort. Centuries ago -- in the Dark Ages, before I\n      ever met you, dear.",
                "SHE. Tell me what you said to her.",
                "HE. What does a man say to a girl? I've forgotten.",
                "SHE. I remember. He tells her that he trusts her and worships the ground\n      she walks on, and that he'll love and honor and protect her till her dying\n      day; and so she marries in that belief. At least, I speak of one girl who\n      was not protected.",
                "HE. Well, and then?",
                "SHE. And then, Guy, and then, that girl needs ten times the love and trust\n      and honor -- yes, honor -- that was enough when she was only a mere\n      wife if -- if -- the other life she chooses to lead is to be made\n      even bearable. Do you understand?",
                "HE. Even bearable! It'll he Paradise.",
                "SHE. Ah! Can you give me all I've asked for -- not now, nor a few\n      months later, but when you begin to think of what you might have done if\n      you had kept your own appointment and your caste here -- when you begin\n      to look upon me as a drag and a burden? I shall want it most, then, Guy,\n      for there will be no one in the wide world but you.",
                "HE. You're a little over-tired tonight, Sweetheart, and you're taking a\n      stage view of the situation. After the necessary business in the Courts,\n      the road is clear to --",
                "SHE. \"The holy state of matrimony!\" Ha! ha! ha!",
                "HE. Ssh! Don't laugh in that horrible way!",
                "SHE. I-I c-c-c-can't help it! Isn't it too absurd! Ah! Ha! ha! ha! Guy,\n      stop me quick or I shall -- l-l-laugh till we get to the Church.",
                "HE. For goodness' sake, stop! Don't make an exhibition of yourself. What\n      is the matter with you?",
                "SHE. N-nothing. I'm better now.",
                "HE. That's all right. One moment, dear. There's a little wisp of hair got\n      loose from behind your right ear and it's straggling over your cheek. So!",
                "SHE. Thank'oo. I'm 'fraid my hat's on one side, too.",
                "HE. What do you wear these huge dagger bonnet-skewers for? They're big\n      enough to kill a man with.",
                "SHE. Oh! Don't kill me, though. You're sticking it into my head! Let me do\n      it. You men are so clumsy.",
                "HE. Have you had many opportunities of comparing us -- in this sort of\n      work?",
                "SHE. Guy, what is my name?",
                "HE. Eh! I don't follow.",
                "SHE. Here's my cardcase. Can you read?",
                "HE. Yes. Well?",
                "SHE. Well, that answers your question. You know the other man's name. Am I\n      sufficiently humbled, or would you like to ask me if there is any one\n      else?",
                "HE. I see now. My darling, I never meant that for an instant. I was only\n      joking. There! Lucky there's no one on the road. They'd be scandalized.",
                "SHE. They'll be more scandalized before the end.",
                "HE. Do-on't! I don't like you to talk in that way.",
                "SHE. Unreasonable man! Who asked me to face the situation and accept it?\n      Tell me, do I look like Mrs. Penner? Do I look like a naughty woman? Swear\n      I don't! Give me your word of honor, my honorable friend, that I'm not\n      like Mrs. Buzgago. That's the way she stands, with her hands clasped at\n      the back of her head. D'you like that?",
                "HE. Don't be affected.",
                "SHE. I'm not. I'm Mrs. Buzgago. Listen!",
                "Pendant une anne' toute entiere\n    Le regiment n'a pas r'paru.\n    Au Ministere de la Guerre\n    On le r'porta comme perdu.\n\n    On se r'noncait a r'trouver sa trace,\n    Quand un matin subitement,\n    On le vit r'paraitre sur la place\n    L'Colonel toujours en avant.",
                "That's the way she rolls her r's. Am I like her?",
                "HE. No, but I object when you go on like an actress and sing stuff of that\n      kind. Where in the world did you pick up the Chanson du Colonel? It isn't\n      a drawing-room song. It isn't proper.",
                "SHE. Mrs. Buzgago taught it me. She is both drawing-room and proper, and\n      in another month she'll shut her drawing-room to me, and thank God she\n      isn't as improper as I am. Oh, Guy, Guy! I wish I was like some women and\n      had no scruples about -- what is it Keene says? -- \"Wearing a\n      corpse's hair and being false to the bread they eat.\"",
                "HE. I am only a man of limited intelligence, and just now, very\n      bewildered. When you have quite finished flashing through all your moods\n      tell me, and I'll try to understand the last one.",
                "SHE. Moods, Guy! I haven't any. I'm sixteen years old and you're just\n      twenty, and you've been waiting for two hours outside the school in the\n      cold. And now I've met you, and now we're walking home together. Does that\n      suit you, My Imperial Majesty?",
                "HE. No. We aren't children. Why can't you be rational?",
                "SHE. He asks me that when I'm going to commit suicide for his sake, and,\n      and -- I don't want to be French and rave about my mother, but have I\n      ever told you that I have a mother, and a brother who was my pet before I\n      married? He's married now. Can't you imagine the pleasure that the news of\n      the elopement will give him? Have you any people at Home, Guy, to be\n      pleased with your performances?",
                "HE. One or two. One can't make omelets without breaking eggs.",
                "SHE (slowly). I don't see the necessity --",
                "HE. Hah! What do you mean?",

                "SHE. What do you think of me?",
                "HE. Beside the question altogether. What do you intend to do?",
                "SHE. I daren't risk it. I'm afraid. If I could only cheat --",
                "HE. A la Buzgago? No, thanks. That's the one point on which I have any\n      notion of Honor. I won't eat his salt and steal too. I'll loot openly or\n      not at all.",
                "SHE. I never meant anything else.",
                "HE. Then, why in the world do you pretend not to be willing to come?",
                "SHE. It's not pretence, Guy. I am afraid.",
                "HE. Please explain.",
                "SHE. It can't last, Guy. It can't last. You'll get angry, and then you'll\n      swear, and then you'll get jealous, and then you'll mistrust me -- you\n      do now -- and you yourself will be the best reason for doubting.

She drops her final g's like a barmaid or a blue-blooded\n      Aide-de-Camp. 'Look he-ere, you're gettin' too fond 0' me,' she said, and\n      The Dancing Master owned it was so in language that nearly made me ill.\n      The Dowd reflected for a while. Then we heard her say, 'Look he-ere,\n      Mister Bent, why are you such an awful liar?' I nearly exploded while The\n      Dancing Master denied the charge.

                "\"I said he wouldn't.\"",
                "\"And she had taken this to heart, on personal grounds, I suppose. She\n      drawled along for five minutes, reproaching him with his perfidy and grew\n      quite motherly.

'She's ten times too good for a fat old man like you,\n      and, look he-ere, you never told me a word about her, and I've been\n      thinkin' about it a good deal, and I think you're a liar.' Wasn't that\n      delicious? The Dancing Master maundered and raved till the Hawley Boy\n      suggested that he should burst in and beat him. His voice runs up into an\n      impassioned squeak when he is afraid. The Dowd must be an extraordinary\n      woman. She explained that had he been a bachelor she might not have\n      objected to his devotion; but since he was a married man and the father of\n      a very nice baby, she considered him a hypocrite, and this she repeated\n      twice. She wound up her drawl with: 'An I'm tellin' you this because your\n      wife is angry with me, an' I hate quarrellin' with any other woman, an' I\n      like your wife. You know how you have behaved for the last six weeks. You\n      shouldn't have done it, indeed you shouldn't. You're too old an' fat.'\n      Can't you imagine how The Dancing Master would wince at that! 'Now go\n      away,' she said. 'I don't want to tell you what I think of you, because I\n      think you are not nice. I'll stay he-ere till the next dance begins.' Did\n      you think that the creature had so much in her?\"",
                "\"I never studied her as closely as you did. It sounds unnatural. What\n      happened?\"",

She grunted at the end of each sentence and, in the\n      end he went away swearing to himself, quite like a man in a novel. He\n      looked more objectionable than ever. I laughed. I love that woman -- in\n      spite of her clothes. And now I'm going to bed. What do you think of it?\"",

                "Mrs. Hauksbee's account of her eavesdropping was an ornate one but\n      truthful in the main. For reasons best known to herself, Mrs. \"Shady\"\n       Delville had turned upon Mr Bent and rent him limb from limb, casting him\n      away limp and disconcerted ere she withdrew the light of her eyes from him\n      permanently. Being a man of resource, and anything but pleased in that he\n      had been called both old and fat, he gave Mrs. Bent to understand that he\n      had, during her absence in the Doon, been the victim of unceasing\n      persecution at the hands of Mrs. Delville, and he told the tale so often\n      and with such eloquence that he ended in believing it, while his wife\n      marvelled at the manners and customs of \"some women.\" When the situation\n      showed signs of languishing, Mrs. Waddy was always on hand to wake the\n      smouldering fires of suspicion in Mrs. Bent's bosom and to contribute\n      generally to the peace and comfort of the hotel. Mr. Bent's life was not a\n      happy one, for if Mrs. Waddy's story were true, he was, argued his wife,\n      untrustworthy to the last degree. If his own statement was true, his\n      charms of manner and conversation were so great that he needed constant\n      surveillance. And he received it, till he repented genuinely of his\n      marriage and neglected his personal appearance. Mrs. Delville alone in the\n      hotel was unchanged. She removed her chair some six paces toward the head\n      of the table, and occasionally in the twilight ventured on timid overtures\n      of friendship to Mrs. Bent, which were repulsed.",

Of course, nobody knew anything about this\n      in the little English village where he was just \"old Mr. Wick\" and had\n      forgotten that he was a Companion of the Order of the Star of India.",
                "He patted Bobby on the shoulder and said: \"Well done, my boy!\"",

                "The Tail Twisters were a most particular Regiment. Those who knew them\n      least said that they were eaten up with \"side.\" But their reserve and\n      their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy.\n      Some five years before, the Colonel commanding had looked into the\n      fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all\n      applied to enter the Staff Corps, and had asked them why the three stars\n      should he, a colonel of the Line, command a dashed nursery for\n      double-dashed bottle-suckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode\n      qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken Black Regiments. He was\n      a rude man and a terrible. Wherefore the remnant took measures [with the\n      half-butt as an engine of public opinion] till the rumor went abroad that\n      young men who used the Tail Twisters as a crutch to the Staff Corps, had\n      many and varied trials to endure. However a regiment had just as much\n      right to its own secrets as a woman.",
                "When Bobby came up from Deolali and took his place among the Tail\n      Twisters, it was gently But firmly borne in upon him that the Regiment was\n      his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife, and that there\n      was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that of bringing\n      shame on the Regiment, which was the best-shooting, best-drilled,\n      best-set-up, bravest, most illustrious, and in all respects most desirable\n      Regiment within the compass of the Seven Seas. He was taught the legends\n      of the Mess Plate from the great grinning Golden Gods that had come out of\n      the Summer Palace in Pekin to the silver-mounted markhor-horn snuff-mull\n      presented by the last C. 0. [he who spake to the seven subalterns]. And\n      every one of those legends told him of battles fought at long odds,\n      without fear as without support; of hospitality catholic as an Arab's; of\n      friendships deep as the sea and steady as the fighting-line; of honor won\n      by hard roads for honor's sake; and of instant and unquestioning devotion\n      to the Regiment -- the Regiment that claims the lives of all and lives\n      forever.",
                "More than once, too, he came officially into contact with the Regimental\n      colors, which looked like the lining of a bricklayer's hat on the end of a\n      chewed stick. Bobby did not kneel and worship them, because British\n      subalterns are not constructed in that manner. Indeed, he condemned them\n      for their weight at the very moment that they were filling with awe and\n      other more noble sentiments.",
                "But best of all was the occasion when he moved with the Tail Twisters, in\n      review order at the breaking of a November day. Allowing for duty-men and\n      sick, the Regiment was one thousand and eighty strong, and Bobby belonged\n      to them; for was he not a Subaltern of the Line the whole Line and nothing\n      but the Line -- as the tramp of two thousand one hundred and sixty\n      sturdy ammunition boots attested. He would not have changed places with\n      Deighton of the Horse Battery, whirling by in a pillar of cloud to a\n      chorus of \"Strong right! Strong left!\" or Hogan-Yale of the White Hussars,\n      leading his squadron for all it was worth, with the price of horseshoes\n      thrown in; or \"Tick\" Boileau, trying to live up to his fierce blue and\n      gold turban while the wasps of the Bengal Cavalry stretched to a gallop in\n      the wake of the long, lollopping Walers of the White Hussars.",
                "They fought through the clear cool day, and Bobby felt a little thrill run\n      down his spine when he heard the tinkle-tinkle-tinkle of the empty\n      cartridge-cases hopping from the breech-blocks after the roar of the\n      volleys; for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action. The\n      review ended in a glorious chase across the plain -- batteries\n      thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the White Hussars, and the\n      Tyneside Tail Twisters hunting a Sikh Regiment, till the lean lathy Singhs\n      panted with exhaustion. Bobby was dusty and dripping long before noon, but\n      his enthusiasm was merely focused -- not diminished.",
                "He returned to sit at the feet of Revere, his \"skipper,\" that is to say,\n      the Captain of his Company, and to be instructed in the dark art and\n      mystery of managing men, which is a very large part of the Profession of\n      Arms.",
                "\"If you haven't a taste that way,\" said Revere, between his puffs of his\n      cheroot, \"you'll never be able to get the hang of it, but remember Bobby,\n      'tisn't the best drill, though drill is nearly everything, that hauls a\n      Regiment through Hell and out on the other side.

                "\"Dormer, for instance,\" said Bobby. \"I think he comes under the head of\n      fool-men. He mopes like a sick owl.\"",
                "\"That's where you make your mistake, my son. Dormer isn't a fool yet, but\n      he's a dashed dirty soldier, and his room corporal makes fun of his socks\n      before kit-inspection. Dormer, being two-thirds pure brute, goes into a\n      corner and growls.\"",
                "\"How do you know?\" said Bobby, admiringly.",
                "\"Because a Company commander has to know these things -- because, if he\n      does not know, he may have crime -- ay, murder -- brewing under his\n      very nose and yet not see that it's there. Dormer is being badgered out of\n      his mind -- big as he is -- and he hasn't intellect enough to resent\n      it. He's taken to quiet boozing and, Bobby, when the butt of a room goes\n      on the drink, or takes to moping by himself, measures are necessary to\n      pull him out of himself.\"",
                "\"What measures? 'Man can't run round coddling his men forever.\"",
                "\"No. The men would precious soon show him that he was not wanted. You've\n      got to\" -- Here the Color-sergeant entered with some papers; Bobby\n      reflected for a while as Revere looked through the Company forms.",
                "\"Does Dormer do anything, Sergeant?\" Bobby asked, with the air of one\n      continuing an interrupted conversation.",
                "\"No, sir. Does 'is dooty like a hortomato,\" said the Sergeant, who\n      delighted in long words. \"A dirty soldier, and 'e's under full stoppages\n      for new kit. It's covered with scales, sir.\"",
                "\"Scales? What scales?\"",
                "\"Fish-scales, sir. 'E's always pokin' in the mud by the river an'\n      a-cleanin' them muchly-fish with 'is thumbs.\" Revere was still absorbed in\n      the Company papers, and the Sergeant, who was sternly fond of Bobby,\n      continued, -- \"'E generally goes down there when 'e's got 'is skinful,\n      beggin' your pardon, sir, an' they do say that the more lush in-he-briated\n      'e is, the more fish 'e catches. They call 'im the Looney Fish-monger in\n      the Comp'ny, sir.\"",
                "Revere signed the last paper and the Sergeant retreated.",
                "\"It's a filthy amusement,\" sighed Bobby to himself. Then aloud to Revere:\n      \"Are you really worried about Dormer?\"",
                "\"A little. You see he's never mad enough to send to a hospital, or drunk\n      enough to run in, but at any minute he may flare up, brooding and sulking\n      as he does. He resents any interest being shown in him, and the only time\n      I took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident.\"",
                "\"I fish,\" said Bobby, with a wry face. \"I hire a country-boat and go down\n      the river from Thursday to Sunday, and the amiable Dormer goes with me -- if\n      you can spare us both.\"",
                "\"You blazing young fool!\" said Revere, but his heart was full of much more\n      pleasant words.",
                "Bobby, the Captain of a dhoni, with Private Dormer for mate, dropped down\n      the river on Thursday morning -- the Private at the bow, the Subaltern\n      at the helm. The Private glared uneasily at the Subaltern, who respected\n      the reserve of the Private.",
                "After six hours, Dormer paced to the stern, saluted, and said -- \"Beg\n      y'pardon, sir, but was you ever on the Durh'm Canal?\"",
                "\"No,\" said Bobby Wick. \"Come and have some tiffin.\"",
                "They ate in silence. As the evening fell, Private Dormer broke forth,\n      speaking to himself -- \"Hi was on the Durh'm Canal, jes' such a night,\n      come next week twelve month, a-trailin' of my toes in the water.\" He\n      smoked and said no more till bedtime.",
                "The witchery of the dawn turned the grey river-reaches to purple, gold,\n      and opal; and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the\n      splendors of a new heaven.",
                "Private Dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory\n      below and around.",
                "\"Well -- damn-my-eyes!\" said Private Dormer, in an awed whisper. \"This\n      'ere is like a bloomin' gallantry-show!\" For the rest of the day he was\n      dumb, but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big\n      fish.",
                "The boat returned on Saturday evening. Dormer had been struggling with\n      speech since noon. As the lines and luggage were being disembarked, he\n      found tongue.",
                "\"Beg y'pardon -- sir,\" he said, \"but would you -- would you min'\n      shakin' 'ands with me, sir?\"",
                "\"Of course not,\" said Bobby, and he shook accordingly. Dormer returned to\n      barracks and Bobby to mess.",
                "\"He wanted a little quiet and some fishing, I think,\" said Bobby. \"My\n      aunt, but he's a filthy sort of animal! Have you ever seen him clean\n      'them, muchly-fish with 'is thumbs'?\"",
                "\"Anyhow,\" said Revere, three weeks later, \"he's doing his best to keep his\n      things clean.\"",
                "When the spring died, Bobby joined in the general scramble for Hill leave,\n      and to his surprise and delight secured three months.",
                "\"As good a boy as I want,\" said Revere, the admiring skipper.",
                "\"The best of the batch,\" said the Adjutant to the Colonel. \"Keep back that\n      young skrim-shanker Porkiss, sir, and let Revere make him sit up.\"",

                "\"What a nice boy!\" said the matrons and the maids.",
                "\"First-class place, Simla. Oh, ri-ipping!\" said Bobby Wick, and ordered\n      new white cord breeches on the strength of it.",
                "\"We're in a bad way,\" wrote Revere to Bobby at the end of two months.\n      \"Since you left, the Regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten with\n      it -- two hundred in hospital, about a hundred in cells -- drinking\n      to keep off fever -- and the Companies on parade fifteen file strong at\n      the outside. There's rather more sickness in the out-villages than I care\n      for, but then I'm so blistered with prickly-heat that I'm ready to hang\n      myself. What's the yarn about your mashing a Miss Haverley up there? Not\n      serious, I hope? You're over-young to hang millstones round your neck, and\n      the Colonel will turf you out of that in double-quick time if you attempt\n      it.\"",
                "It was not the Colonel that brought Bobby out of Simla, but a much more to\n      be respected Commandant. The sick ness in the out-villages spread, the\n      Bazar was put out of bounds, and then came the news that the Tail Twisters\n      must go into camp. The message flashed to the Hill stations. -- \"Cholera -- Leave\n      stopped -- Officers recalled.\" Alas, for the white gloves in the neatly\n      soldered boxes, the rides and the dances and picnics that were to he, the\n      loves half spoken, and the debts unpaid! Without demur and without\n      question, fast as tongue could fly or pony gallop, back to their Regiments\n      and their Batteries, as though they were hastening to their weddings, fled\n      the subalterns.",
                "Bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at Viceregal Lodge\n      where he had -- but only the Haverley girl knows what Bobby had said or\n      how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball. Six in the morning saw\n      Bobby at the Tonga Office in the drenching rain, the whirl of the last\n      waltz still in his ears, and an intoxication due neither to wine nor\n      waltzing in his brain.",
                "\"Good man!\" shouted Deighton of the Horse Battery, through the mists.\n      \"Whar you raise dat tonga? I'm coming with you. Ow! But I've had a head\n      and a half. I didn't sit out all night. They say the Battery's awful bad,\"\n       and he hummed dolorously -- Leave the what at the what's-its-name,\n      Leave the flock without shelter, Leave the corpse uninterred, Leave the\n      bride at the altar!",
                "\"My faith! It'll be more bally corpse than bride, though, this journey.\n      Jump in, Bobby. Get on, Coachman!\"",
                "On the Umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the\n      latest news from the stricken cantonment, and it was here that Bobby\n      learned the real condition of the Tail Twisters.",
                "\"They went into camp,\" said an elderly Major recalled from the\n      whist-tables at Mussoorie to a sickly Native Regiment, \"they went into\n      camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts.

                "\"But they were as fit as be-damned when I left them!\" said Bobby.",
                "\"Then you'd better make them as fit as be-damned when you rejoin,\" said\n      the Major, brutally.",
                "Bobby pressed his forehead against the rain-splashed windowpane as the\n      train lumbered across the sodden Doab, and prayed for the health of the\n      Tyneside Tail Twisters. Naini Tal had sent down her contingent with all\n      speed; the lathering ponies of the Dalhousie Road staggered into\n      Pathankot, taxed to the full stretch of their strength; while from cloudy\n      Darjiling the Calcutta Mail whirled up the last straggler of the little\n      army that was to fight a fight, in which was neither medal nor honor for\n      the winning, against an enemy none other than \"the sickness that\n      destroyeth in the noonday.\"",
                "And as each man reported himself, he said: \"This is a bad business,\" and\n      went about his own forthwith, for every Regiment and Battery in the\n      cantonment was under canvas, the sickness bearing them company.",
                "Bobby fought his way through the rain to the Tail Twisters' temporary\n      mess, and Revere could have fallen on the boy's neck for the joy of seeing\n      that ugly, wholesome phiz once more.",
                "\"Keep 'em amused and interested,\" said Revere. \"They went on the drink,\n      poor fools, after the first two cases, and there was no improvement. Oh,\n      it's good to have you back, Bobby! Porkiss is a -- never mind.\"",
                "Deighton came over from the Artillery camp to attend a dreary mess dinner,\n      and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the condition\n      of his beloved Battery. Porkiss so far forgot himself as to insinuate that\n      the presence of the officers could do no earthly good, and that the best\n      thing would be to send the entire Regiment into hospital and \"let the\n      doctors look after them.\" Porkiss was demoralized with fear, nor was his\n      peace of mind restored when Revere said coldly: \"Oh! The sooner you go out\n      the better, if that's your way of thinking. Any public school could send\n      us fifty good men in your place, but it takes time, time, Porkiss, and\n      money, and a certain amount of trouble, to make a Regiment. 'S'pose you're\n      the person we go into camp for, eh?\"",
                "Whereupon Porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a\n      drenching in the rain did not allay, and, two days later, quitted this\n      world for another where, men do fondly hope, allowances are made for the\n      weaknesses of the flesh. The Regimental Sergeant-Major looked wearily\n      across the Sergeants' Mess tent when the news was announced.",
                "\"There goes the worst of them,\" he said. \"It'll take the best, and then,\n      please God, it'll stop.\" The Sergeants were silent till one said: \"It\n      couldn't be him!\" and all knew of whom Travis was thinking.",
                "Bobby Wick stormed through the tents of his Company, rallying, rebuking\n      mildly, as is consistent with the Regulations, chaffing the faint-hearted:\n      haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there was a break in the\n      weather, and bidding them be of good cheer for their trouble was nearly at\n      an end; scuttling on his dun pony round the outskirts of the camp and\n      heading back men who, with the innate perversity of British soldier's,\n      were always wandering into infected villages, or drinking deeply from\n      rain-flooded marshes; comforting the panic-stricken with rude speech, and\n      more than once tending the dying who had no friends -- the men without\n      \"townies\"; organizing, with banjos and burned cork, Sing-songs which\n      should allow the talent of the Regiment full play; and generally, as he\n      explained, \"playing the giddy garden-goat all round.\"",
                "\"You're worth half a dozen of us, Bobby,\" said Revere in a moment of\n      enthusiasm. \"How the devil do you keep it up?\"",
                "Bobby made no answer, but had Revere looked into the breast-pocket of his\n      coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badly-written letters which\n      perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy. A letter came to\n      Bobby every other day. The spelling was not above reproach, but the\n      sentiments must have been most satisfactory, for on receipt Bobby's eyes\n      softened marvelously, and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction\n      for a while ere, shaking his cropped head, he charged into his work.",
                "By what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest, and the Tail\n      Twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed, was a mystery\n      to both skipper and C. O., who learned from the regimental chaplain that\n      Bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital tents than the\n      Reverend John Emery.",
                "\"The men seem fond of you. Are you in the hospitals much?\" said the\n      Colonel, who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a\n      hardness that did not cover his bitter grief.",
                "\"A little, sir,\" said Bobby.",
                "\"Shouldn't go there too often if I were you. They say it's not contagious,\n      but there's no use in running unnecessary risks. We can't afford to have\n      you down, y'know.\"",
                "Six days later, it was with the utmost difficulty that the post-runner\n      plashed his way out to the camp with mailbags, for the rain was falling in\n      torrents. Bobby received a letter, bore it off to his tent, and, the\n      programme for the next week's Sing-song being satisfactorily disposed of,\n      sat down to answer it. For an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the paper,\n      and where sentiment rose to more than normal tide-level Bobby Wick stuck\n      out his tongue and breathed heavily. He was not used to letter-writing.",
                "\"Beg y'pardon, sir,\" said a voice at the tent door; \"but Dormer's 'orrid\n      bad, sir, an' they've taken him orf, sir.",
                "\"Damn Private Dormer and you too!\" said Bobby Wick running the blotter\n      over the half-finished letter. \"Tell him I'll come in the morning.\"",
                "\"'E's awful bad, sir,\" said the voice, hesitatingly. There was an\n      undecided squelching of heavy boots.",
                "\"Well?\" said Bobby, impatiently.",
                "\"Excusin' 'imself before an' for takin' the liberty, 'e says it would be a\n      comfort for to assist 'im, sir, if\" --",
                "\"Tattoo lao! Get my pony! Here, come in out of the rain till I'm ready.\n      What blasted nuisances you are! That's brandy. Drink some; you want it.\n      Hang on to my stirrup and tell me if I go mo fast.\"",
                "Strengthened by a four-finger \"nip\" which he swallowed without a wink, the\n      Hospital Orderly kept up with the slipping, mud-stained, and very\n      disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent.",
                "Private Dormer was certainly \"'orrid bad.\" He had all but reached the\n      stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon.",
                "\"What's this, Dormer?\" said Bobby, bending over the man. \"You're not going\n      out this time. You've got to come fishin' with me once or twice more yet.\"",
                "The blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper said, -- \"Beg\n      y'pardon, sir, disturbin' of you now, but would you min' 'oldin' my 'and,\n      sir?\"",
                "Bobby sat on the side of the bed, and the icy cold hand closed on his own\n      like a vice, forcing a lady's ring which was on the little finger deep\n      into the flesh. Bobby set his lips and waited, the water dripping from the\n      hem of his trousers. An hour passed and the grasp of the hand did not\n      relax, nor did the expression on the drawn face change. Bobby with\n      infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left hand -- his right\n      arm was numbed to the elbow -- and resigned himself to a night of pain.",
                "Dawn showed a very white-faced Subaltern sitting on the side of a sick\n      man's cot, and a Doctor in the doorway using language unfit for\n      publication.",
                "\"Have you been here all night, you young ass?\" said the Doctor.",
                "\"There or thereabouts,\" said Bobby, ruefully. \"He's frozen on to me.\"",
                "Dormer's mouth shut with a click. He turned his head and sighed. The\n      clinging band opened, and Bobby's arm fell useless at his side.",
                "\"He'll do,\" said the Doctor, quietly. \"It must have been a toss-up all\n      through the night. 'Think you're to be congratulated on this case.\"",
                "\"Oh, bosh!\" said Bobby. \"I thought the man had gone out long ago -- only -- only\n      I didn't care to take my hand away. Rub my arm down, there's a good chap.\n      What a grip the brute has! I'm chilled to the marrow!\" He passed out of\n      the tent shivering.",
                "Private Dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of Death by strong\n      waters. Four days later, he sat on the side of his cot and said to the\n      patients mildly: \"I'd 'a' liken to 'a' spoken to 'im -- so I should.\"",
                "But at that time Bobby was reading yet another letter -- he had the\n      most persistent correspondent of any man in camp -- and was even then\n      about to write that the sickness had abated, and in another week at the\n      outside would be gone. He did not intend to say that the chill of a sick\n      man's hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for\n      affection he dwelt on at such length. He did intend to enclose the\n      illustrated programme of the forthcoming Sing-song whereof he was not a\n      little proud. He also intended to write on many other matters which do not\n      concern us, and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish\n      headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess.",
                "\"You are overdoing it, Bobby,\" said his skipper. \"'Might give the rest of\n      us credit of doing a little work. You go on as if you were the whole Mess\n      rolled into one. Take it easy.\"",
                "\"I will,\" said Bobby. \"I'm feeling done up, somehow.\" Revere looked at him\n      anxiously and said nothing.",
                "There was a flickering of lanterns about the camp that night, and a rumor\n      that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors, a paddling of the\n      naked feet of doolie-bearers and the rush of a galloping horse.",
                "\"Wot's up?\" asked twenty tents; and through twenty tents ran the answer -- \"Wick,\n      'e's down.\"",
                "They brought the news to Revere and he groaned. \"Any one but Bobby and I\n      shouldn't have cared! The Sergeant-Major was right.\"",
                "\"Not going out this journey,\" gasped Bobby, as he was lifted from the\n      doolie. \"Not going out this journey.\" Then with an air of supreme\n      conviction -- \"I can't, you see.\"",
                "\"Not if I can do anything!\" said the Surgeon-Major, who had hastened over\n      from the mess where he had been dining.",
                "He and the Regimental Surgeon fought together with Death for the life of\n      Bobby Wick. Their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a\n      blue-grey dressing-gown who stared in horror at the bed and cried -- \"Oh,\n      my Gawd. It can't be 'im!\" until an indignant Hospital Orderly whisked him\n      away.",
                "If care of man and desire to live could have done aught, Bobby would have\n      been saved. As it was, he made a fight of three days, and the\n      Surgeon-Major's brow uncreased. \"We'll save him yet,\" he said; and the\n      Surgeon, who, though he ranked with the Captain, had a very youthful\n      heart, went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud.",
                "\"Not going out this journey,\" whispered Bobby Wick, gallantly, at the end\n      of the third day.",
                "\"Bravo!\" said the Surgeon-Major. \"That's the way to look at it, Bobby.\"",
                "As evening fell a grey shade gathered round Bobby's mouth, and he turned\n      his face to the tent wall wearily. The Surgeon-Major frowned.",
                "\"I'm awfully tired,\" said Bobby, very faintly. \"What's the use of\n      bothering me with medicine? I-don't-want-it. Let me alone.\"",
                "The desire for life had departed, and Bobby was content to drift away on\n      the easy tide of Death.",
                "\"It's no good,\" said the Surgeon-Major. \"He doesn't want to live. He's\n      meeting it, poor child.\" And he blew his nose.",
                "Half a mile away, the regimental band was playing the overture to the\n      Sing-song, for the men had been told that Bobby was out of danger. The\n      clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached Bobby's ears.",
                "Is there a single joy or pain,\n    That I should never kno-ow?\n    You do not love me, 'tis in vain,\n    Bid me goodbye and go!",
                "An expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boy's face, and he tried\n      to shake his head.",
                "The Surgeon-Major bent down -- \"What is it? Bobby?\" --",
                "\"Not that waltz,\" muttered Bobby. \"That's our own -- our very ownest\n      own. Mummy dear.\"",
                "With this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next\n      morning.",
                "Revere, his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white, went into\n      Bobby's tent to write a letter to Papa Wick which should bow the white\n      head of the ex-Commissioner of Chota-Buldana in the keenest sorrow of his\n      life. Bobby's little store of papers lay in confusion on the table, and\n      among them a half-finished letter. The last sentence ran: \"So you see,\n      darling, there is really no fear, because as long as I know you care for\n      me and I care for you, nothing can touch me.\"",
                "Revere stayed in the tent for an hour. When he came out, his eyes were\n      redder than ever.",
                "Private Conklin sat on a turned-down bucket, and listened to a not\n      unfamiliar tune. Private Conklin was a convalescent and should have been\n      tenderly treated.",
                "\"Ho!\" said Private Conklin. \"There's another bloomin' orf'cer dead.\"",
                "The bucket shot from under him, and his eyes filled with a smithyful of\n      sparks. A tall man in a blue-grey bedgown was regarding him with deep\n      disfavor.",

                "People who have seen, say that one of the quaintest spectacles of human\n      frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls' school. It starts without\n      warning, generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils. A girl\n      giggles till the giggle gets beyond control. Then she throws up her head,\n      and cries, \"Honk, honk, honk,\" like a wild goose, and tears mix with the\n      laughter. If the mistress be wise she will rap out something severe at\n      this point to check matters. If she be tender-hearted, and send for a\n      drink of water, the chances are largely in favor of another girl laughing\n      at the afflicted one and herself collapsing. Thus the trouble spreads, and\n      may end in half of what answers to the Lower Sixth of a boys' school\n      rocking and whooping together. Given a week of warm weather, two stately\n      promenades per diem, a heavy mutton and rice meal in the middle of the\n      day, a certain amount of nagging from the teachers, and a few other\n      things, some amazing effects develop. At least this is what folk say who\n      have had experience.",
                "Now, the Mother Superior of a Convent and the Colonel of a British\n      Infantry Regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made\n      between their respective charges. But it is a fact that, under certain\n      circumstances, Thomas in bulk can be worked up into dithering, rippling\n      hysteria. He does not weep, but he shows his trouble unmistakably, and the\n      consequences get into the newspapers, and all the good people who hardly\n      know a Martini from a Snider say: \"Take away the brute's ammunition!\"",
                "Thomas isn't a brute, and his business, which is to look after the\n      virtuous people, demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand. He\n      doesn't wear silk stockings, and he really ought to be supplied with a new\n      Adjective to help him to express his opinions; but, for all that, he is a\n      great man. If you call him \"the heroic defender of the national honor\" one\n      day, and \"a brutal and licentious soldiery\" the next, you naturally\n      bewilder him, and he looks upon you with suspicion. There is nobody to\n      speak for Thomas except people who have theories to work off on him; and\n      nobody understands Thomas except Thomas, and he does not always know what\n      is the matter with himself.",
                "That is the prologue. This is the story:",
                "Corporal Slane was engaged to be married to Miss Jhansi M'Kenna, whose\n      history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere. He had his Colonel's\n      permission, and, being popular with the men, every arrangement had been\n      made to give the wedding what Private Ortheris called \"eeklar.\" It fell in\n      the heart of the hot weather, and, after the wedding, Slane was going up\n      to the Hills with the Bride. None the less, Slane's grievance was that the\n      affair would Be only a hired-carriage wedding, and he felt that the\n      \"eeklar\" of that was meagre. Miss M'Kenna did not care so much. The\n      Sergeant's wife was helping her to make her wedding-dress, and she was\n      very busy. Slane was, just then, the only moderately contented man in\n      barracks. All the rest were more or less miserable.",
                "And they had so much to make them happy, too. All their work was over at\n      eight in the morning, and for the rest of the day they could lie on their\n      backs and smoke Canteen-plug and swear at the punkah-coolies. They enjoyed\n      a fine, full flesh meal in the middle of the day, and then threw\n      themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool\n      enough to go out with their \"towny,\" whose vocabulary contained less than\n      six hundred words, and the Adjective, and whose views on every conceivable\n      question they had heard many times before.",
                "There was the Canteen, of course, and there was the Temperance Room with\n      the second-hand papers in it; but a man of any profession cannot read for\n      eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in the\n      shade, running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight. Very few men, even\n      though they get a pannikin of flat, stale, muddy beer and hide it under\n      their cots, can continue drinking for six hours a day. One man tried, but\n      he died, and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave\n      them something to do. It was too early for the excitement of fever or\n      cholera. The men could only wait and wait and wait, and watch the shadow\n      of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust. That was a gay\n      life.",
                "They lounged about cantonments -- it was too hot for any sort of game,\n      and almost too hot for vice -- and fuddled themselves in the evening,\n      and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food\n      provided for them, and the more they stoked the less exercise they took\n      and more explosive they grew. Then tempers began to wear away, and men\n      fell a-brooding over insults real or imaginary, for they had nothing else\n      to think of. The tone of the repartees changed, and instead of saying\n      light-heartedly: \"I'll knock your silly face in,\" men grew laboriously\n      polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough for themselves\n      and their enemy, and that there would be more space for one of the two in\n      another place.",
                "It may have been the Devil who arranged the thing, but the fact of the\n      case is that Losson had for a long time been worrying Simmons in an\n      aimless way. It gave him occupation. The two had their cots side by side,\n      and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other; but\n      Simmons was afraid of Losson and dared not challenge him to a fight. He\n      thought over the words in the hot still nights, and half the hate he felt\n      toward Losson be vented on the wretched punkah-coolie.",
                "Losson bought a parrot in the bazar, and put it into a little cage, and\n      lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well, and sat on the\n      well-curb, shouting bad language down to the parrot. He taught it to say:\n      \"Simmons, ye so-oor,\" which means swine, and several other things entirely\n      unfit for publication. He was a big gross man, and he shook like a jelly\n      when the parrot had the sentence correctly. Simmons, however, shook with\n      rage, for all the room were laughing at him -- the parrot was such a\n      disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so human when it\n      chattered. Losson used to sit, swinging his fat legs, on the side of the\n      cot, and ask the parrot what it thought of Simmons. The parrot would\n      answer: \"Simmons, ye so-oor.\" \"Good boy,\" Losson used to say, scratching\n      the parrot's head; \"ye 'ear that, Sim?\"",
                "And Simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer: \"I 'ear.\n      Take 'eed you don't 'ear something one of these days.\"",
                "In the restless nights, after he had been asleep all day, fits of blind\n      rage came upon Simmons and held him till he trembled all over, while he\n      thought in how many different ways he would slay Losson. Sometimes he\n      would picture himself trampling the life out of the man, with heavy\n      ammunition-boots, and at others smashing in his face with the butt, and at\n      others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the\n      neckbone cracked. Then his mouth would feel hot and fevered, and he would\n      reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin.",
                "But the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him longest\n      was one connected with the great roll of fat under Losson's right ear. He\n      noticed it first on a moonlight night, and thereafter it was always before\n      his eyes. It was a fascinating roll of fat. A man could get his hand upon\n      it and tear away one side of the neck; or he could place the muzzle of a\n      rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash. Losson had no right to\n      be sleek and contented and well-to-do, when he, Simmons, was the butt of\n      the room, Some day, perhaps, he would show those who laughed at the\n      \"Simmons, ye so-oor\" joke, that he was as good as the rest, and held a\n      man's life in the crook of his forefinger. When Losson snored, Simmons\n      hated him more bitterly than ever. Why should Losson be able to sleep when\n      Simmons had to stay awake hour after hour, tossing and turning on the\n      tapes, with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head\n      throbbing and aching after Canteen? He thought over this for many nights,\n      and the world became unprofitable to him. He even blunted his naturally\n      fine appetite with beer and tobacco; and all the while the parrot talked\n      at and made a mock of him.",
                "The heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before. A\n      Sergeant's wife died of heat-apoplexy in the night, and the rumor ran\n      abroad that it was cholera. Men rejoiced openly, hoping that it would\n      spread and send them into camp. But that was a false alarm.",
                "It was late on a Tuesday evening, and the men were waiting in the deep\n      double verandas for \"Last Posts,\" when Simmons went to the box at the foot\n      of his bed, took out his pipe, and slammed the lid down with a bang that\n      echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle. Ordinarily\n      speaking, the men would have taken no notice; but their nerves were\n      fretted to fiddle-strings. They jumped up, and three or four clattered\n      into the barrack-room only to find Simmons kneeling by his box.",
                "\"Owl It's you, is it?\" they said and laughed foolishly. \"We t h o u g h t\n      'twas\" -- Simmons rose slowly. If the accident had so shaken his\n      fellows, what would not the reality do?",
                "\"You thought it was -- did you? And what makes you think?\" he said,\n      lashing himself into madness as he went on; \"to Hell with your thinking,\n      ye dirty spies.\"",
                "\"Simmons, ye so-oor,\" chuckled the parrot in the veranda, sleepily,\n      recognizing a well-known voice. Now that was absolutely all.",
                "The tension snapped. Simmons fell back on the arm-rack deliberately, -- the\n      men were at the far end of the room, -- and took out his rifle and\n      packet of ammunition. \"Don't go playing the goat, Sim!\" said Losson. \"Put\n      it down,\" but there was a quaver in his voice. Another man stooped,\n      slipped his boot and hurled it at Simmons's head. The prompt answer was a\n      shot which, fired at random, found its billet in Losson's throat. Losson\n      fell forward without a word, and the others scattered.",
                "\"You thought it was!\" yelled Simmons. \"You're drivin' me to it! I tell you\n      you're drivin' me to it! Get up, Losson, an' don't lie shammin' there -- you\n      an' your blasted parrit that druv me to it!\"",
                "But there was an unaffected reality about Losson's pose that showed\n      Simmons what he had done. The men were still clamoring on the veranda.\n      Simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the\n      moonlight, muttering: \"I'll make a night of it. Thirty roun's, an' the\n      last for myself. Take you that, you dogs!\"",
                "He dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the veranda,\n      but the bullet flew high, and landed in the brickwork with a vicious phat\n      that made some of the younger ones turn pale. It is, as musketry theorists\n      observe, one thing to fire and another to be fired at.",
                "Then the instinct of the chase flared up. The news spread from barrack to\n      barrack, and the men doubled out intent on the capture of Simmons, the\n      wild beast, who was heading for the Cavalry parade-ground, stopping now\n      and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his\n      pursuers.",
                "\"I'll learn you to spy on me!\" he shouted; \"I'll learn you to give me\n      dorg's names! Come on the 'ole lot o' you! Colonel John Anthony Deever,\n      C.B.!\" -- he turned toward the Infantry Mess and shook his rifle -- \"you\n      think yourself the devil of a man -- but I tell you that if you put\n      your ugly old carcass outside o' that door, I'll make you the\n      poorest-lookin' man in the army. Come out, Colonel John Anthony Deever,\n      C.B.! Come out and see me practiss on the rainge. I'm the crack shot of\n      the 'ole bloomin' battalion.\" In proof of which statement Simmons fired at\n      the lighted windows of the mess-house.",
                "\"Private Simmons, E Comp'ny, on the Cavalry p'rade-ground, Sir, with\n      thirty rounds,\" said a Sergeant breathlessly to the Colonel. \"Shootin'\n      right and lef', Sir. Shot Private Losson. What's to be done, Sir?\"",
                "Colonel John Anthony Deever, C.B., sallied out, only to be saluted by s\n      spurt of dust at his feet.",
                "\"Pull up!\" said the Second in Command; \"I don't want my step in that way,\n      Colonel. He's as dangerous as a mad dog.\"",
                "\"Shoot him like one, then,\" said the Colonel, bitterly, \"if he won't take\n      his chance, My regiment, too! If it had been the Towheads I could have\n      under stood.\"",
                "Private Simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge of\n      the parade-ground, and was defying the regiment to come on. The regiment\n      was not anxious to comply, for there is small honor in being shot by a\n      fellow-private. Only Corporal Slane, rifle in band, threw himself down on\n      the ground, and wormed his way toward the well.",
                "\"Don't shoot,\" said he to the men round him; \"like as not you'll hit me.\n      I'll catch the beggar, livin'.\"",
                "Simmons ceased shouting for a while, and the noise of trap-wheels could be\n      heard across the plain. Major Oldyn, commanding the Horse Battery, was\n      coming back from a dinner in the Civil Lines; was driving after his usual\n      custom -- that is to say, as fast as the horse could go.",
                "\"A orf'cer! A blooming spangled orf'cer,\" shrieked Simmons; \"I'll make a\n      scarecrow of that orf'cer!\" The trap stopped.",
                "\"What's this?\" demanded the Major of Gunners. \"You there, drop your\n      rifle.\"",
                "\"Why, it's Jerry Blazes! I ain't got no quarrel with you, Jerry Blazes.\n      Pass frien', an' all's well!\"",
                "But Jerry Blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous\n      murderer. He was, as his adoring Battery swore long and fervently, without\n      knowledge of fear, and they were surely the best judges, for Jerry Blazes,\n      it was notorious, had done his possible to kill a man each time the\n      Battery went out.",
                "He walked toward Simmons, with the intention of rushing him, and knocking\n      him down.",
                "\"Don't make me do it, Sir,\" said Simmons; \"I ain't got nothing agin you.\n      Ah! you would?\" -- the Major broke into a run -- \"Take that then!\"",
                "The Major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder, and Simmons stood\n      over him. He had lost the satisfaction of killing Losson in the desired\n      way: hut here was a helpless body to his hand. Should be slip in another\n      cartridge, and blow off the head, or with the butt smash in the white\n      face? He stopped to consider, and a cry went up from the far side of the\n      parade-ground: \"He's killed Jerry Blazes!\" But in the shelter of the\n      well-pillars Simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire. \"I'll\n      blow yer 'andsome 'ead off, Jerry Blazes,\" said Simmons, reflectively.\n      \"Six an' three is nine an one is ten, an' that leaves me another nineteen,\n      an' one for myself.\" He tugged at the string of the second packet of\n      ammunition. Corporal Slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank into the\n      moonlight.",
                "\"I see you!\" said Simmons. \"Come a bit furder on an' I'll do for you.\"",
                "\"I'm comm',\" said Corporal Slane, briefly; \"you've done a bad day's work,\n      Sim. Come out 'ere an' come back with me.\"",
                "\"Come to,\" -- laughed Simmons, sending a cartridge home with his thumb.\n      \"Not before I've settled you an' Jerry Blazes.\"",
                "The Corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the parade-ground, a\n      rifle under him. Some of the less-cautious men in the distance shouted:\n      \"Shoot 'im! Shoot 'im, Slane!\"",
                "\"You move 'and or foot, Slane,\" said Simmons, \"an' I'll kick Jerry Blazes'\n      'ead in, and shoot you after.\"",
                "\"I ain't movin',\" said the Corporal, raising his head; \"you daren't 'it a\n      man on 'is legs. Let go o' Jerry Blazes an' come out o' that with your\n      fistes. Come an' 'it me. You daren't, you bloomin' dog-shooter!\"",
                "\"I dare.\"",
                "\"You lie, you man-sticker. You sneakin', Sheeny butcher, you lie. See\n      there!\" Slane kicked the rifle away, and stood up in the peril of his\n      life. \"Come on, now!\"",
                "The temptation was more than Simmons could resist, for the Corporal in his\n      white clothes offered a perfect mark.",
                "\"Don't misname me,\" shouted Simmons, firing as he spoke. The shot missed,\n      and the shooter, blind with rage, threw his rifle down and rushed at Slane\n      from the protection of the well. Within striking distance, he kicked\n      savagely at Slane's stomach, but the weedy Corporal knew something of\n      Simmons's weakness, and knew, too, the deadly guard for that kick. Bowing\n      forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel of the right foot was\n      set some three inches above the inside of the left knee-cap, he met the\n      blow standing on one leg -- exactly as Gonds stand when they meditate -- and\n      ready for the fall that would follow. There was an oath, the Corporal fell\n      over his own left as shinbone met shinbone, and the Private collapsed, his\n      right leg broken an inch above the ankle.",
                "\"'Pity you don't know that guard, Sim,\" said Slane, spitting out the dust\n      as he rose. Then raising his voice, \"Come an' take him orf. I've bruk 'is\n      leg.\" This was not strictly true, for the Private had accomplished his own\n      downfall, since it is the special merit of that leg-guard that the harder\n      the kick the greater the kicker's discomfiture.",
                "Slane walked to Jerry Blazes and hung over him with ostentatious anxiety,\n      while Simmons, weeping with pain, was carried away. \"'Ope you ain't 'urt\n      badly, Sir,\" said Slane. The Major had fainted, and there was an ugly,\n      ragged hole through the top of his arm. Slane knelt down and murmured.\n      \"S'elp me, I believe 'e's dead. Well, if that ain't my blooming luck all\n      over!\"",
                "But the Major was destined to lead his Battery afield for many a long day\n      with unshaken nerve. He was removed, and nursed and petted into\n      convalescence, while the Battery discussed the wisdom of capturing\n      Simmons, and blowing him from a gun. They idolized their Major, and his\n      reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the\n      Army Regulations.",
                "Great, too, was the glory that fell to Slane's share. The Gunners would\n      have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight. Even the\n      Colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness, and the\n      local paper called him a hero. These things did not puff him up. When the\n      Major offered him money and thanks, the virtuous Corporal took the one and\n      put aside the other. But he had a request to make and prefaced it with\n      many a \"Beg y'pardon, Sir.\" Could the Major see his way to letting the\n      Slane-M'Kenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four Battery horses to\n      pull a hired barouche? The Major could, and so could the Battery.\n      Excessively so. It was a gorgeous wedding.",
                "\"Wot did I do it for?\" said Corporal Slane. \"For the 'orses O' course.\n      Jhansi ain't a beauty to look at, but I wasn't goin' to 'ave a hired\n      turn-out. Jerry Blazes? If I 'adn't 'a' wanted something, Sim might ha'\n      blowed Jerry Blazes' blooming 'ead into Hirish stew for aught I'd 'a'\n      cared.\"",
                "And they hanged Private Simmons -- hanged him as high as Haman in\n      hollow square of the regiment; and the Colonel said it was Drink; and the\n      Chaplain was sure it was the Devil; and Simmons fancied it was both, but\n      he didn't know, and only hoped his fate would be a warning to his\n      companions; and half a dozen \"intelligent publicists\" wrote six beautiful\n      leading articles on \"'The Prevalence of Crime in the Army.\"",
                "But not a soul thought of comparing the \"bloody-minded Simmons\" to the\n      squawking, gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens."

                "They were sitting in the veranda of \"the splendid palace of an Indian\n      Pro-Consul\"; surrounded by all the glory and mystery of the immemorial\n      East. In plain English it was a one-storied, ten-roomed, whitewashed,\n      mud-roofed bungalow, set in a dry garden of dusty tamarisk trees and\n      divided from the road by a low mud wall. The green parrots screamed\n      overhead as they flew in battalions to the river for their morning drink.\n      Beyond the wall, clouds of fine dust showed where the cattle and goats of\n      the city were passing afield to graze. The remorseless white light of the\n      winter sunshine of Northern India lay upon everything and improved\n      nothing, from the whining Persian-wheel by the lawn-tennis court to the\n      long perspective of level road and the blue, domed tombs of Mohammedan\n      saints just visible above the trees.",
                "\"A Happy New Year,\" said Orde to his guest. \"It's the first you've ever\n      spent out of England, isn't it?\"",
                "\"Yes. 'Happy New Year,\" said Pagett, smiling at the sunshine. \"What a\n      divine climate you have here! Just think of the brown cold fog hanging\n      over London now!\" And he rubbed his hands.",
                "It was more than twenty years since he had last seen Orde, his schoolmate,\n      and their paths in the world had divided early. The one had quitted\n      college to become a cog-wheel in the machinery of the great Indian\n      Government; the other more blessed with goods, had been whirled into a\n      similar position in the English scheme. Three successive elections had not\n      affected Pagett's position with a loyal constituency, and he had grown\n      insensibly to regard himself in some sort as a pillar of the Empire, whose\n      real worth would be known later on. After a few years of conscientious\n      attendance at many divisions, after newspaper battles innumerable and the\n      publication of interminable correspondence, and more hasty oratory than in\n      his calmer moments he cared to think upon, it occurred to him, as it had\n      occurred to many of his fellows in Parliament, that a tour to India would\n      enable him to sweep a larger lyre and address himself to the problems of\n      Imperial administration with a firmer hand. Accepting, therefore, a\n      general invitation extended to him by Orde some years before, Pagett bad\n      taken ship to Karachi, and only overnight had been received with joy by\n      the Deputy-Commissioner of Amara. They had sat late, discussing the\n      changes and chances of twenty years, recalling the names of the dead, and\n      weighing the futures of the living, as is the custom of men meeting after\n      intervals of action.",
                "Next morning they smoked the after-breakfast pipe in the veranda, still\n      regarding each other curiously, Pagett, in a light grey frock-coat and\n      garments much too thin for the time of the year, and a puggried sun-hat\n      carefully and wonderfully made, Orde in a shooting coat, riding breeches,\n      brown cowhide boots with spurs, and a battered flax helmet. He had ridden\n      some miles in the early morning to inspect a doubtful river dam. The men's\n      faces differed as much as their attire. Orde's worn and wrinkled around\n      the eyes, and grizzled at the temples, was the harder and more square of\n      the two, and it was with something like envy that the owner looked at the\n      comfortable outlines of Pagett's blandly receptive countenance, the clear\n      skin, the untroubled eye, and the mobile, clean-shaved lips.",
                "\"And this is India!\" said Pagett for the twentieth time staring long and\n      intently at the grey feathering of the tamarisks.",
                "\"One portion of India only. It's very much like this for 300 miles in\n      every direction. By the way, now that you have rested a little -- I\n      wouldn't ask the old question before -- what d'you think of the\n      country?\"",
                "\"'Tis the most pervasive country that ever yet was seen. I acquired\n      several pounds of your country coming up from Karachi.

                "\"Yes. It isn't easy to see truly or far in India. But you had a decent\n      passage out, hadn't you?\"",
                "\"Very good on the whole. Your Anglo-Indian may be unsympathetic about\n      one's political views; but he has reduced ship life to a science.\"",
                "\"The Anglo-Indian is a political orphan, and if he's wise he won't be in a\n      hurry to be adopted by your party grandmothers. But how were your\n      companions, unsympathetic?\"",
                "\"Well, there was a man called Dawlishe, a judge somewhere in this country\n      it seems, and a capital partner at whist by the way, and when I wanted to\n      talk to him about the progress of India in a political sense (Orde hid a\n      grin, which might or might not have been sympathetic), the National\n      Congress movement, and other things in which, as a Member of Parliament,\n      I'm of course interested, he shifted the subject, and when I once cornered\n      him, he looked me calmly in the eye, and said: 'That's all Tommy rot. Come\n      and have a game at Bull.' You may laugh; but that isn't the way to treat a\n      great and important question; and, knowing who I was, well, I thought it\n      rather rude, don't you know; and yet Dawlishe is a thoroughly good\n      fellow.\"",
                "\"Yes; he's a friend of mine, and one of the straightest men I know. I\n      suppose, like many Anglo-Indians, he felt it was hopeless to give you any\n      just idea of any Indian question without the documents before you, and in\n      this case the documents you want are the country and the people.\"",
                "\"Precisely. That was why I came straight to you, bringing an open mind to\n      bear on things. I'm anxious to know what popular feeling in India is\n      really like y'know, now that it has wakened into political life. The\n      National Congress, in spite of Dawlishe, must have caused great excitement\n      among the masses?\"",
                "\"On the contrary, nothing could be more tranquil than the state of popular\n      feeling; and as to excitement, the people would as soon be excited over\n      the 'Rule of Three' as over the Congress.\"",
                "\"Excuse me, Orde, but do you think you are a fair judge? Isn't the\n      official Anglo-Indian naturally jealous of any external influences that\n      might move the masses, and so much opposed to liberal ideas, truly liberal\n      ideas, that he can scarcely be expected to regard a popular movement with\n      fairness?\"",
                "\"What did Dawlishe say about Tommy Rot? Think a moment, old man. You and I\n      were brought up together; taught by the same tutors, read the same books,\n      lived the same life, and new languages, and work among new races; while\n      you, more fortunate, remain at home. Why should I change my mind -- our\n      mind -- because I change my sky? Why should I and the few hundred\n      Englishmen in my service become unreasonable, prejudiced fossils, while\n      you and your newer friends alone remain bright and open-minded? You surely\n      don't fancy civilians are members of a Primrose League?\"",
                "\"Of course not, but the mere position of an English official gives him a\n      point of view which cannot but bias his mind on this question.\" Pagett\n      moved his knee up and down a little uneasily as he spoke.",
                "\"That sounds plausible enough, but, like more plausible notions on Indian\n      matters, I believe it's a mistake. You'll find when you come to consult\n      the unofficial Briton that our fault, as a class -- I speak of the\n      civilian now -- is rather to magnify the progress that has been made\n      toward liberal institutions. It is of English origin, such as it is, and\n      the stress of our work since the Mutiny -- only thirty years ago -- has\n      been in that direction. No, I think you will get no fairer or more\n      dispassionate view of the Congress business than such men as I can give\n      you. But I may as well say at once that those who know most of India, from\n      the inside, are inclined to wonder at the noise our scarcely begun\n      experiment makes in England.\"",

A great meeting, what you call a mass meeting, is really one of\n      the oldest and most popular of Indian institutions in this topsy-turvy\n      land, and though they have been employed in clerical work for generations\n      they have no practical knowledge of affairs. A ship's clerk is a useful\n      person, but he is scarcely the captain; and an orderly room writer,\n      however smart he may be, is not the colonel. You see, the writer class in\n      India has never till now aspired to anything like command. It wasn't\n      allowed to.

                "\"Well, at all events, this literary class represent the natural\n      aspirations and wishes of the people at large, though it may not exactly\n      lead them, and, in spite of all you say, Orde, I defy you to find a really\n      sound English Radical who would not sympathize with those aspirations.\"",
                "Pagett spoke with some warmth, and he had scarcely ceased when a\n      well-appointed dog-cart turned into the compound gates, and Orde rose\n      saying: \"Here is Edwards, the Master of the Lodge I neglect so diligently,\n      come to talk about accounts, I suppose.\"",
                "As the vehicle drove up under the porch Pagett also rose, saying with the\n      trained effusion born of much practice: \"But this is also my friend, my\n      old and valued friend Edwards. I'm delighted to see you. I knew you were\n      in India, but not exactly where.\"",
                "\"Then it isn't accounts, Mr. Edwards,\" said Orde, cheerily.",

                "\"Well, you see, sir, things are different out here. There's precious\n      little one can find to say against the Government, which was the main of\n      our talk at home, and them that do say things are not the sort o' people a\n      man who respects himself would like to be mixed up with. There are no\n      politics, in a manner of speaking, in India. It's all work.\"",

                "\"Never hear a word of it from year's end to year's end, and I speak the\n      talk too. But I wanted to ask how things are going on at home -- old\n      Tyler and Brown and the rest?\"",
                "\"We will speak of them presently, but your account of the indifference of\n      your men surprises me almost as much as your own. I fear you are a\n      backslider from the good old doctrine, Edwards.\" Pagett spoke as one who\n      mourned the death of a near relative.",
                "\"Not a bit, Sir, but I should be if I took up with a parcel of baboos,\n      pleaders, and schoolboys, as never did a day's work in their lives, and\n      couldn't if they tried. And if you was to poll us English railway men,\n      mechanics, tradespeople, and the like of that all up and down the country\n      from Peshawur to Calcutta, you would find us mostly in a tale together.\n      And yet you'd know we're the same English you pay some respect to at home\n      at 'lection time, and we have the pull o' knowing something about it.\"",
                "\"This is very curious, but you will let me come and see you, and perhaps\n      you will kindly show me the railway works, and we will talk things over at\n      leisure. And about all old friends and old times,\" added Pagett, detecting\n      with quick insight a look of disappointment in the mechanic's face.",
                "Nodding briefly to Orde, Edwards mounted his dog-cart and drove off.",
                "\"It's very disappointing,\" said the Member to Orde, who, while his friend\n      discoursed with Edwards, had been looking over a bundle of sketches drawn\n      on grey paper in purple ink, brought to him by a Chuprassee.",
                "\"Don't let it trouble you, old chap,\" 'said Orde, sympathetically. \"Look\n      here a moment, here are some sketches by the man who made the carved wood\n      screen you admired so much in the dining-room, and wanted a copy of, and\n      the artist himself is here too.\"",
                "\"A native?\" said Pagett.",
                "\"Of course,\" was the reply, \"Bishen Singh is his name, and he has two\n      brothers to help him. When there is an important job to do, the three go\n      into partnership, but they spend most of their time and all their money in\n      litigation over an inheritance, and I'm afraid they are getting involved,\n      Thoroughbred Sikhs of the old rock, obstinate, touchy, bigoted, and\n      cunning, but good men for all that. Here is Bishen Singh -- shall we\n      ask him about the Congress?\"",
                "But Bishen Singh, who approached with a respectful salaam, had never heard\n      of it, and he listened with a puzzled face and obviously feigned interest\n      to Orde's account of its aims and objects, finally shaking his vast white\n      turban with great significance when he learned that it was promoted by\n      certain pleaders named by Orde, and by educated natives. He began with\n      labored respect to explain how he was a poor man with no concern in such\n      matters, which were all under the control of God, but presently broke out\n      of Urdu into familiar Punjabi, the mere sound of which had a rustic smack\n      of village smoke-reek and plough-tail, as he denounced the wearers of\n      white coats, the jugglers with words who filched his field from him, the\n      men whose backs were never bowed in honest work; and poured ironical scorn\n      on the Bengali. He and one of his brothers had seen Calcutta, and being at\n      work there had Bengali carpenters given to them as assistants.",
                "\"Those carpenters!\" said Bishen Singh. \"Black apes were more efficient\n      workmates, and as for the Bengali babu -- tchick!\" The guttural click\n      needed no interpretation, but Orde translated the rest, while Pagett gazed\n      with interest at the wood-carver.",
                "\"He seems to have a most illiberal prejudice against the Bengali,\" said\n      the M.P.",
                "\"Yes, it's very sad that for ages outside Bengal there should be so bitter\n      a prejudice. Pride of race, which also means race-hatred, is the plague\n      and curse of India and it spreads far,\" Orde pointed with his riding-whip\n      to the large map of India on the veranda wall.",
                "\"See! I begin with the North,\" said he. \"There's the Afghan, and, as a\n      highlander, he despises all the dwellers in Hindoostan -- with the\n      exception of the Sikh, whom he hates as cordially as the Sikh hates him.\n      The Hindu loathes Sikh and Afghan, and the Rajput -- that's a little\n      lower down across this yellow blot of desert -- has a strong objection,\n      to put it mildly, to the Maratha who, by the way, poisonously hates the\n      Afghan. Let's go North a minute. The Sindhi hates everybody I've\n      mentioned. Very good, we'll take less warlike races. The cultivator of\n      Northern India domineers over the man in the next province, and the Behari\n      of the Northwest ridicules the Bengali. They are all at one on that point.\n      I'm giving you merely the roughest possible outlines of the facts, of\n      course.\"",
                "Bishen Singh, his clean cut nostrils still quivering, watched the large\n      sweep of the whip as it traveled from the frontier, through Sindh, the\n      Punjab and Rajputana, till it rested by the valley of the Jumna.",
                "\"Hate -- eternal and inextinguishable hate,\" concluded Orde, flicking\n      the lash of the whip across the large map from East to West as he sat\n      down. \"Remember Canning's advice to Lord Granville, 'Never write or speak\n      of Indian things without looking at a map.'\"",
                "Pagett opened his eyes, Orde resumed. \"And the race-hatred is only a part\n      of it. What's really the matter with Bishen Singh is class-hatred, which,\n      unfortunately, is even more intense and more widely spread. That's one of\n      the little drawbacks of caste, which some of your recent English writers\n      find an impeccable system.\"",
                "The wood-carver was glad to be recalled to the business of his craft, and\n      his eyes shone as he received instructions for a carved wooden doorway for\n      Pagett, which he promised should be splendidly executed and despatched to\n      England in six months. It is an irrelevant detail, but in spite of Orde's\n      reminders, fourteen months elapsed before the work was finished. Business\n      over, Bishen Singh hung about, reluctant to take his leave, and at last\n      joining his hands and approaching Orde with bated breath and whispering\n      humbleness, said he had a petition to make. Orde's face suddenly lost all\n      trace of expression. \"Speak on, Bishen Singh,\" said he, and the carver in\n      a whining tone explained that his case against his brothers was fixed for\n      hearing before a native judge and -- here he dropped his voice still\n      lower till he was summarily stopped by Orde, who sternly pointed to the\n      gate with an emphatic Begone!",
                "Bishen Singh, showing but little sign of discomposure, salaamed\n      respectfully to the friends and departed.",
                "Pagett looked inquiry; Orde, with complete recovery of his usual urbanity,\n      replied: \"It's nothing, only the old story, he wants his case to be tried\n      by an English judge -- they all do that -- but when he began to hint\n      that the other side were in improper relations with the native judge I had\n      to shut him up. Gunga Ram, the man he wanted to make insinuations about,\n      may not be very bright; but he's as honest as daylight on the bench. But\n      that's just what one can't get a native to believe.\"",
                "\"Do you really mean to say these people prefer to have their cases tried\n      by English judges?\"",
                "\"Why, certainly.\"",
                "Pagett drew a long breath. \"I didn't know that before.\" At this point a\n      phaeton entered the compound, and Orde rose with \"Confound it, there's old\n      Rasul Ali Khan come to pay one of his tiresome duty calls. I'm afraid we\n      shall never get through our little Congress discussion.\"",
                "Pagett was an almost silent spectator of the grave formalities of a visit\n      paid by a punctilious old Mahommedan gentleman to an Indian official; and\n      was much impressed by the distinction of manner and fine appearance of the\n      Mohammedan landholder. When the exchange of polite banalities came to a\n      pause, he expressed a wish to learn the courtly visitor's opinion of the\n      National Congress.",
                "Orde reluctantly interpreted, and with a smile which even Mohammedan\n      politeness could not save from bitter scorn, Rasul Ali Khan intimated that\n      he knew nothing about it and cared still less. It was a kind of talk\n      encouraged by the Government for some mysterious purpose of its own, and\n      for his own part he wondered and held his peace.",
                "Pagett was far from satisfied with this, and wished to have the old\n      gentleman's opinion on the propriety of managing all Indian affairs on the\n      basis of an elective system.",
                "Orde did his best to explain, but it was plain the visitor was bored and\n      bewildered. Frankly, he didn't think much of committees; they had a\n      Municipal Committee at Lahore and had elected a menial servant, an\n      orderly, as a member. He had been informed of this on good authority, and\n      after that, committees had ceased to interest him. But all was according\n      to the rule of Government, and, please God, it was all for the best.",
                "\"What an old fossil it is!\" cried Pagett, as Orde returned from seeing his\n      guest to the door; \"just like some old blue-blooded hidalgo of Spain. What\n      does he really think of the Congress after all, and of the elective\n      system?\"",
                "\"Hates it all like poison. When you are sure of a majority, election is a\n      fine system; but you can scarcely expect the Mahommedans, the most\n      masterful and powerful minority in the country, to contemplate their own\n      extinction with joy. The worst of it is that he and his co-religionists,\n      who are many, and the landed proprietors, also, of Hindu race, are\n      frightened and put out by this election business and by the importance we\n      have bestowed on lawyers, pleaders, writers, and the like, who have, up to\n      now, been in abject submission to them. They say little, but after all\n      they are the most important fagots in the great bundle of communities, and\n      all the glib bunkum in the world would not pay for their estrangement.\n      They have controlled the land.\"",
                "\"But I am assured that experience of local self-government in your\n      municipalities has been most satisfactory, and when once the principle is\n      accepted in your centres, don't you know, it is bound to spread, and these\n      important -- ah -- people of yours would learn it like the rest. I\n      see no difficulty at all,\" and the smooth lips closed with the complacent\n      snap habitual to Pagett, M.P., the \"man of cheerful yesterdays and\n      confident tomorrows.\"",
                "Orde looked at him with a dreary smile.",
                "\"The privilege of election has been most reluctantly withdrawn from scores\n      of municipalities, others have had to be summarily suppressed, and,\n      outside the Presidency towns, the actual work done has been badly\n      performed. This is of less moment, perhaps -- it only sends up the\n      local death-rates -- than the fact that the public interest in\n      municipal elections, never very strong, has waned, and is waning, in spite\n      of careful nursing on the part of Government servants.\"",
                "\"Can you explain this lack of interest?\" said Pagett, putting aside the\n      rest of Orde's remarks.",
                "\"You may find a ward of the key in the fact that only one in every\n      thousand of our population can spell. Then they are infinitely more\n      interested in religion and caste questions than in any sort of politics.\n      When the business of mere existence is over, their minds are occupied by a\n      series of interests, pleasures, rituals, superstitions, and the like,\n      based on centuries of tradition and usage. You, perhaps, find it hard to\n      conceive of people absolutely devoid of curiosity, to whom the book, the\n      daily paper, and the printed speech are unknown, and you would describe\n      their life as blank. That's a profound mistake. You are in another land,\n      another century, down on the bed-rock of society, where the family merely,\n      and not the community, is all-important. The average Oriental cannot be\n      brought to look beyond his clan. His life, too, is more complete and\n      self-sufficing, and less sordid and low-thoughted than you might imagine.\n      It is bovine and slow in some respects, but it is never empty. You and I\n      are inclined to put the cart before the horse, and to forget that it is\n      the man that is elemental, not the book. 'The corn and the cattle are all\n      my care, And the rest is the will of God.' Why should such folk look up\n      from their immemorially appointed round of duty and interests to meddle\n      with the unknown and fuss with voting-papers. How would you, atop of all\n      your interests care to conduct even one-tenth of your life according to\n      the manners and customs of the Papuans, let's say? That's what it comes\n      to.\"",
                "\"But if they won't take the trouble to vote, why do you anticipate that\n      Mohammedans, proprietors, and the rest would be crushed by majorities of\n      them?\"",
                "Again Pagett disregarded the closing sentence.",
                "\"Because, though the landholders would not move a finger on any purely\n      political question, they could be raised in dangerous excitement by\n      religious hatreds. Already the first note of this has been sounded by the\n      people who are trying to get up an agitation on the cow-killing question,\n      and every year there is trouble over the Mohammedan Muharrum processions.",
                "\"But who looks after the popular rights, being thus unrepresented?\"",
                "\"The Government of Her Majesty the Queen, Empress of India, in which, if\n      the Congress promoters are to be believed, the people have an implicit\n      trust; for the Congress circular, specially prepared for rustic\n      comprehension, says the movement is 'for the remission of tax, the\n      advancement of Hindustan, and the strengthening of the British\n      Government.' This paper is headed in large letters-'MAY THE PROSPERITY OF\n      THE EMPIRE OF INDIA ENDURE.'\"",
                "\"Really!\" said Pagett, \"that shows some cleverness. But there are things\n      better worth imitation in our English methods of -- er -- political\n      statement than this sort of amiable fraud.\"",
                "\"Anyhow,\" resumed Orde, \"you perceive that not a word is said about\n      elections and the elective principle, and the reticence of the Congress\n      promoters here shows they are wise in their generation.\"",
                "\"But the elective principle must triumph in the end, and the little\n      difficulties you seem to anticipate would give way on the introduction of\n      a well-balanced scheme, capable of indefinite extension.\"",
                "\"But is it possible to devise a scheme which, always assuming that the\n      people took any interest in it, without enormous expense, ruinous\n      dislocation of the administration and danger to the public peace, can\n      satisfy the aspirations of Mr. Hume and his following, and yet safeguard\n      the interests of the Mahommedans, the landed and wealthy classes, the\n      Conservative Hindus, the Eurasians, Parsees, Sikhs, Rajputs, native\n      Christians, domiciled Europeans and others, who are each important and\n      powerful in their way?\"",
                "Pagett's attention, however, was diverted to the gate, where a group of\n      cultivators stood in apparent hesitation.",
                "\"Here are the twelve Apostles, by Jove -- come straight out of\n      Raffaele's cartoons,\" said the M.P., with the fresh appreciation of a\n      newcomer.",
                "Orde, loth to be interrupted, turned impatiently toward the villagers, and\n      their leader, handing his long staff to one of his companions, advanced to\n      the house.",
                "\"It is old Jelbo, the Lumherdar, or head-man of Pind Sharkot, and a very\n      intelligent man for a villager.\"",
                "The Jat farmer had removed his shoes and stood smiling on the edge of the\n      veranda. His strongly marked features glowed with russet bronze, and his\n      bright eyes gleamed under deeply set brows, contracted by lifelong\n      exposure to sunshine. His beard and moustache streaked with grey swept\n      from bold cliffs of brow and cheek in the large sweeps one sees drawn by\n      Michael Angelo, and strands of long black hair mingled with the\n      irregularly piled wreaths and folds of his turban. The drapery of stout\n      blue cotton cloth thrown over his broad shoulders and girt round his\n      narrow loins, hung from his tall form in broadly sculptured folds, and he\n      would have made a superb model for an artist in search of a patriarch.",
                "Orde greeted him cordially, and after a polite pause the countryman\n      started off with a long story told with impressive earnestness. Orde\n      listened and smiled, interrupting the speaker at times to argue and reason\n      with him in a tone which Pagett could hear was kindly, and finally\n      checking the flux of words was about to dismiss him, when Pagett suggested\n      that he should be asked about the National Congress.",
                "But Jelbo had never heard of it. He was a poor man and such things, by the\n      favor of his Honor, did not concern him.",
                "\"What's the matter with your big friend that he was so terribly in\n      earnest?\" asked Pagett, when he had left.",
                "\"Nothing much. He wants the blood of the people in the next village, who\n      have had smallpox and cattle plague pretty badly, and by the help of a\n      wizard, a currier, and several pigs have passed it on to his own village.\n      'Wants to know if they can't be run in for this awful crime. It seems they\n      made a dreadful charivari at the village boundary, threw a quantity of\n      spell-bearing objects over the border, a buffalo's skull and other things;\n      then branded a chamur -- what you would call a currier -- on his\n      hinder parts and drove him and a number of pigs over into Jelbo's village.\n      Jelbo says he can bring evidence to prove that the wizard directing these\n      proceedings, who is a Sansi, has been guilty of theft, arson,\n      cattle-killing, perjury and murder, but would prefer to have him punished\n      for bewitching them and inflicting smallpox.\"",
                "\"And how on earth did you answer such a lunatic?\"",
                "\"Lunatic! -- the old fellow is as sane as you or I; and he has some\n      ground of complaint against those Sansis. I asked if he would like a\n      native superintendent of police with some men to make inquiries, but he\n      objected on the grounds the police were rather worse than smallpox and\n      criminal tribes put together.\"",
                "\"Criminal tribes -- er -- I don't quite understand,\" said Pagett.",
                "\"We have in India many tribes of people who in the slack anti-British days\n      became robbers, in various kind, and preyed on the people. They are being\n      restrained and reclaimed little by little, and in time will become useful\n      citizens, but they still cherish hereditary traditions of crime, and are a\n      difficult lot to deal with. By the way what about the political rights of\n      these folk under your schemes? The country people call them vermin, but I\n      suppose they would be electors with the rest.\"",
                "\"Nonsense -- special provision would be made for them in a\n      well-considered electoral scheme, and they would doubtless be treated with\n      fitting severity,\" said Pagett, with a magisterial air.",
                "\"Severity, yes -- but whether it would be fitting is doubtful. Even\n      those poor devils have rights, and, after all, they only practice what\n      they have been taught.\"",
                "\"But criminals, Orde!\"",
                "\"Yes, criminals with codes and rituals of crime, gods and godlings of\n      crime, and a hundred songs and sayings in praise of it. Puzzling, isn't\n      it?\"",
                "\"It's simply dreadful. They ought to be put down at once. Are there many\n      of them?\"",
                "\"Not more than about sixty thousand in this province, for many of the\n      tribes broadly described as criminal are really vagabond and criminal only\n      on occasion, while others are being settled and reclaimed. They are of\n      great antiquity, a legacy from the past, the golden, glorious Aryan past\n      of Max Muller, Birdwood and the rest of your spindrift philosophers.\"",
                "An orderly brought a card to Orde, who took it with a movement of\n      irritation at the interruption, and banded it to Pagett; a large card with\n      a ruled border in red ink, and in the centre in schoolboy copper plate,\n      Mr. Dma Nath. \"Give salaam,\" said the civilian, and there entered in haste\n      a slender youth, clad in a closely fitting coat of grey homespun, tight\n      trousers, patent-leather shoes, and a small black velvet cap. His thin\n      cheek twitched, and his eyes wandered restlessly, for the young man was\n      evidently nervous and uncomfortable, though striving to assume a free and\n      easy air.",
                "\"Your honor may perhaps remember me,\" he said in English, and Orde scanned\n      him keenly.",
                "\"I know your face somehow. You belonged to the Shershah district I think,\n      when I was in charge there?\"",
                "\"Yes, Sir, my father is writer at Shershah, and your honor gave me a prize\n      when I was first in the Middle School examination five years ago. Since\n      then I have prosecuted my studies, and I am now second year's student in\n      the Mission College -- \"",
                "\"Of course: you are Kedar Nath's son -- the boy who said he liked\n      geography better than play or sugar cakes, and I didn't believe you. How\n      is your father getting on?\"",

                "\"My mother,\" said the young man, with a visible effort to bring himself to\n      pronounce the word, \"has no ideas, and my father is not agriculturist, nor\n      working class; he is of the Kayeth caste; but he had not the advantage of\n      a collegiate education, and he does not know much of the Congress. It is a\n      movement for the educated young-man\" -- connecting adjective and noun\n      in a sort of vocal hyphen.",
                "\"Ah, yes,\" said Pagett, feeling he was a little off the rails, \"and what\n      are the benefits you expect to gain by it?\"",
                "\"Oh, sir, everything. England owes its greatness to Parliamentary\n      institutions, and we should at once gain the same high position in scale\n      of nations. Sir, we wish to have the sciences, the arts, the manufactures,\n      the industrial factories, with steam engines, and other motive powers and\n      public meetings, and debates. Already we have a debating club in\n      connection with the college, and elect a Mr. Speaker. Sir, the progress\n      must come. You also are a Member of Parliament and worship the great Lord\n      Ripon,\" said the youth, breathlessly, and his black eyes flashed as he\n      finished his commaless sentences.",
                "\"Well,\" said Pagett, drily, \"it has not yet occurred to me to worship his\n      Lordship, although I believe he is a very worthy man, and I am not sure\n      that England owes quite all the things you name to the House of Commons.\n      You see, my young friend, the growth of a nation like ours is slow,\n      subject to many influences, and if you have read your history aright\" --",
                "\"Sir. I know it all -- all! Norman Conquest, Magna Charta, Runnymede,\n      Reformation, Tudors, Stuarts, Mr. Milton and Mr. Burke, and I have read\n      something of Mr. Herbert Spencer and Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall,'\n      Reynolds' 'Mysteries of the Court,' and\" --",
                "Pagett felt like one who had pulled the string of a shower-bath unawares,\n      and hastened to stop the torrent with a question as to what particular\n      grievances of the people of India the attention of an elected assembly\n      should be first directed. But young Mr. Dma Nath was slow to\n      particularize. There were many, very many demanding consideration. Mr.\n      Pagett would like to hear of one or two typical examples. The Repeal of\n      the Arms Act was at last named, and the student learned for the first time\n      that a license was necessary before an Englishman could carry a gun in\n      England. Then natives of India ought to be allowed to become Volunteer\n      Riflemen if they chose, and the absolute equality of the Oriental with his\n      European fellow-subject in civil status should be proclaimed on principle,\n      and the Indian Army should be considerably reduced. The student was not,\n      however, prepared with answers to Mr. Pagett's mildest questions on these\n      points, and he returned to vague generalities, leaving the M.P. so much\n      impressed with the crudity of his views that he was glad on Orde's return\n      to say goodbye to his \"very interesting\" young friend.",
                "\"What do you think of young India?\" asked Orde.",
                "\"Curious, very curious -- and callow.\"",
                "\"And yet,\" the civilian replied, \"one can scarcely help sympathizing with\n      him for his mere youth's sake. The young orators of the Oxford Union\n      arrived at the same conclusions and showed doubtless just the same\n      enthusiasm. If there were any political analogy between India and England,\n      if the thousand races of this Empire were one, if there were any chance\n      even of their learning to speak one language, if, in short, India were a\n      Utopia of the debating-room, and not a real land, this kind of talk might\n      be worth listening to, but it is all based on false analogy and ignorance\n      of the facts.\"",
                "\"But he is a native and knows the facts.\"",
                "\"He is a sort of English schoolboy, but married three years, and the\n      father of two weaklings, and knows less than most English schoolboys. You\n      saw all he is and knows, and such ideas as he has acquired are directly\n      hostile to the most cherished convictions of the vast majority of the\n      people.\"",
                "\"But what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college? Is\n      he a Christian?\"",
                "\"He meant just what he said, and he is not a Christian, nor ever will he\n      be. Good people in America, Scotland and England, most of whom would never\n      dream of collegiate education for their own sons, are pinching themselves\n      to bestow it in pure waste on Indian youths. Their scheme is an oblique,\n      subterranean attack on heathenism; the theory being that with the jam of\n      secular education, leading to a University degree, the pill of moral or\n      religious instruction may he coaxed down the heathen gullet.\"",
                "\"But does it succeed; do they make converts?\"",
                "\"They make no converts, for the subtle Oriental swallows the jam and\n      rejects the pill; but the mere example of the sober, righteous, and godly\n      lives of the principals and professors who are most excellent and devoted\n      men, must have a certain moral value. Yet, as Lord Lansdowne pointed out\n      the other day, the market is dangerously overstocked with graduates of our\n      Universities who look for employment in the administration. An immense\n      number are employed, but year by year the college mills grind out\n      increasing lists of youths foredoomed to failure and disappointment, and\n      meanwhile, trades, manufactures, and the industrial arts are neglected,\n      and in fact regarded with contempt by our new literary mandarins in\n      posse.\"",
                "\"But our young friend said he wanted steam-engines and factories,\" said\n      Pagett.",
                "\"Yes, he would like to direct such concerns. He wants to begin at the top,\n      for manual labor is held to be discreditable, and he would never defile\n      his hands by the apprenticeship which the architects, engineers, and\n      manufacturers of England cheerfully undergo; and he would be aghast to\n      learn that the leading names of industrial enterprise in England belonged\n      a generation or two since, or now belong, to men who wrought with their\n      own hands. And, though he talks glibly of manufacturers, he refuses to see\n      that the Indian manufacturer of the future will be the despised workman of\n      the present. It was proposed, for example, a few weeks ago, that a certain\n      municipality in this province should establish an elementary technical\n      school for the sons of workmen. The stress of the opposition to the plan\n      came from a pleader who owed all he had to a college education bestowed on\n      him gratis by Government and missions. You would have fancied some fine\n      old crusted Tory squire of the last generation was speaking. 'These\n      people,' he said, 'want no education, for they learn their trades from\n      their fathers, and to teach a workman's son the elements of mathematics\n      and physical science would give him ideas above his business. They must be\n      kept in their place, and it was idle to imagine that there was any science\n      in wood or iron work.' And he carried his point. But the Indian workman\n      will rise in the social scale in spite of the new literary caste.\"",
                "\"In England we have scarcely begun to realize that there is an industrial\n      class in this country, yet, I suppose, the example of men, like Edwards\n      for instance, must tell,\" said Pagett, thoughtfully.",
                "\"That you shouldn't know much about it is natural enough, for there are\n      but few sources of information. India in this, as in other respects, is\n      like a badly kept ledger -- not written up to date. And men like\n      Edwards are, in reality, missionaries, who by precept and example are\n      teaching more lessons than they know. Only a few, however, of their crowds\n      of subordinates seem to care to try to emulate them, and aim at individual\n      advancement; the rest drop into the ancient Indian caste groove.\"",
                "\"How do you mean?\" asked Pagett.",
                "\"Well, it is found that the new railway and factory workmen, the fitter,\n      the smith, the engine-driver, and the rest are already forming separate\n      hereditary castes. You may notice this down at Jamalpur in Bengal, one of\n      the oldest railway centres; and at other places, and in other industries,\n      they are following the same inexorable Indian law.\"",
                "\"Which means?\" queried Pagett.",
                "\"It means that the rooted habit of the people is to gather in small\n      self-contained, self-sufficing family groups with no thought or care for\n      any interests but their own -- a habit which is scarcely compatible\n      with the right acceptation of the elective principle.\"",
                "\"Yet you must admit, Orde, that though our young friend was not able to\n      expound the faith that is in him, your Indian army is too big.\"",
                "\"Not nearly big enough for its main purpose. And, as a side issue, there\n      are certain powerful minorities of fighting folk whose interests an\n      Asiatic Government is bound to consider. Arms is as much a means of\n      livelihood as civil employ under Government and law. And it would be a\n      heavy strain on British bayonets to hold down Sikhs, Jats, Bilochis,\n      Rohillas, Rajputs, Bhils, Dogras, Pathans, and Gurkhas to abide by the\n      decisions of a numerical majority opposed to their interests. Leave the\n      'numerical majority' to itself without the British bayonets -- a flock\n      of sheep might as reasonably hope to manage a troop of collies.\"",
                "\"This complaint about excessive growth of the army is akin to another\n      contention of the Congress party. They protest against the malversation of\n      the whole of the moneys raised by additional taxes as a Famine Insurance\n      Fund to other purposes. You must be aware that this special Famine Fund\n      has all been spent on frontier roads and defences and strategic railway\n      schemes as a protection against Russia.\"",
                "\"But there was never a special famine fund raised by special taxation and\n      put by as in a box. No sane administrator would dream of such a thing. In\n      a time of prosperity a finance minister, rejoicing in a margin, proposed\n      to annually apply a million and a half to the construction of railways and\n      canals for the protection of districts liable to scarcity, and to the\n      reduction of the annual loans for public works. But times were not always\n      prosperous, and the finance minister had to choose whether he would bang\n      up the insurance scheme for a year or impose fresh taxation. When a farmer\n      hasn't got the little surplus he hoped to have for buying a new wagon and\n      draining a low-lying field corner, you don't accuse him of malversation,\n      if he spends what he has on the necessary work of the rest of his farm.\"",
                "A clatter of hoofs was heard, and Orde looked up with vexation, but his\n      brow cleared as a horseman halted under the porch.",

                "\"Why, no!

But though these\n      bodies would like, as Reggie puts it, to make Government sit up, it is an\n      elementary consideration in governing a country like India, which must be\n      administered for the benefit of the people at large, that the counsels of\n      those who resort to it for the sake of making money should be judiciously\n      weighed and not allowed to overpower the rest. They are welcome guests\n      here, as a matter of course, but it has been found best to restrain their\n      influence. Thus the rights of plantation laborers, factory operatives, and\n      the like, have been protected, and the capitalist, eager to get on, has\n      not always regarded Government action with favor.

You\n      can't gather figs from thistles, and so long as the system of infant\n      marriage, the prohibition of the remarriage of widows, the lifelong\n      imprisonment of wives and mothers in a worse than penal confinement, and\n      the withholding from them of any kind of education or treatment as\n      rational beings continues, the country can't advance a step. Half of it is\n      morally dead, and worse than dead, and that's just the half from which we\n      have a right to look for the best impulses. It's right here where the\n      trouble is, and not in any political considerations whatsoever.\"",
                "\"But do they marry so early?\" said Pagett, vaguely.",

One\n      result is that girls of twelve and thirteen have to bear the burden of\n      wifehood and motherhood, and, as might be expected, the rate of mortality\n      both for mothers and children is terrible. Pauperism, domestic\n      unhappiness, and a low state of health are only a few of the consequences\n      of this. Then, when, as frequently happens, the boy-husband dies\n      prematurely, his widow is condemned to worse than death. She may not\n      remarry, must live a secluded and despised life, a life so unnatural that\n      she sometimes prefers suicide; more often she goes astray.

He can scarcely be expected to distinguish between the ambitions of\n      a new oligarchy and the real wants of the people of whom he knows nothing.\n      But it's strange that a professed Radical should come to be the chosen\n      advocate of a movement which has for its aim the revival of an ancient\n      tyranny. Shows how even Radicalism can fall into academic grooves and miss\n      the essential truths of its own creed. Believe me, Pagett, to deal with\n      India you want first-hand knowledge and experience. I wish he would come\n      and live here for a couple of years or so.\"",
                "\"Is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument?\"",
                "\"Can't help it in a case like this. Indeed, I am not sure you ought not to\n      go further and weigh the whole character and quality and upbringing of the\n      man. You must admit that the monumental complacency with which he trotted\n      out his ingenious little Constitution for India showed a strange want of\n      imagination and the sense of humor.\"",
                "\"No, I don't quite admit it,\" said Pagett.",
                "\"Well, you know him and I don't, but that's how it strikes a stranger.\" He\n      turned on his heel and paced the veranda thoughtfully. \"And, after all,\n      the burden of the actual, daily unromantic toil falls on the shoulders of\n      the men out here, and not on his own. He enjoys all the privileges of\n      recommendation without responsibility, and we -- well, perhaps, when\n      you've seen a little more of India you'll understand. To begin with, our\n      death rate's five times higher than yours -- I speak now for the brutal\n      bureaucrat -- and we work on the refuse of worked-out cities and\n      exhausted civilizations, among the bones of the dead. In the case of the\n      Congress meetings, the only notable fact is that the priests of the altar\n      are British, not Buddhist, Jain or Brahminical, and that the whole thing\n      is a British contrivance kept alive by the efforts of Messrs. Hume,\n      Eardley, Norton, and Digby.\"",
                "\"You mean to say, then, it's not a spontaneous movement?\"",
                "\"What movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word? This\n      seems to be more factitious than usual. You seem to know a great deal\n      about it; try it by the touchstone of subscriptions, a coarse but fairly\n      trustworthy criterion, and there is scarcely the color of money in it. The\n      delegates write from England that they are out of pocket for working\n      expenses, railway fares, and stationery -- the mere pasteboard and\n      scaffolding of their show. It is, in fact, collapsing from mere financial\n      inanition.\"",
                "\"But you cannot deny that the people of India, who are, perhaps, too poor\n      to subscribe, are mentally and morally moved by the agitation,\" Pagett\n      insisted.",
                "\"That is precisely what I do deny. The native side of the movement is the\n      work of a limited class, a microscopic minority, as Lord Dufferin\n      described it, when compared with the people proper, but still a very\n      interesting class, seeing that it is of our own creation. It is composed\n      almost entirely of those of the literary or clerkly castes who have\n      received an English education.\"",
                "\"Surely that's a very important class. Its members must be the ordained\n      leaders of popular thought.\"",
                "\"Anywhere else they might be leaders, but they have no social weight\n      here.\"",
                "Pagett laughed. \"That's an epigrammatic way of putting it, Orde.\"",
                "\"Is it? Let's see,\" said the Deputy Commissioner of Amara, striding into\n      the sunshine toward a half-naked gardener potting roses. He took the man's\n      hoe, and went to a rain-scarped bank at the bottom of the garden.",
                "\"Come here, Pagett,\" he said, and cut at the sun-baked soil. After three\n      strokes there rolled from under the blade of the hoe the half of a\n      clanking skeleton that settled at Pagett's feet in an unseemly jumble of\n      bones. The M.P. drew back.",
                "\"Our houses are built on cemeteries,\" said Orde. \"There are scores of\n      thousands of graves within ten miles.\"",
                "Pagett was contemplating the skull with the awed fascination of a man who\n      has but little to do with the dead. \"India's a very curious place,\" said\n      he, after a pause.",
                "\"Ah? You'll know all about it in three months. Come in to lunch,\" said\n      Orde."

                "She was the daughter of Sonoo, a Hill-man, and Jadeh his wife. One year\n      their maize failed, and two bears spent the night in their only\n      poppy-field just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarh side; so, next\n      season, they turned Christian, and brought their baby to the Mission to be\n      baptized. The Kotgarh Chaplain christened her Elizabeth, and \"Lispeth\" is\n      the Hill or pahari pronunciation.",
                "Later, cholera came into the Kotgarh Valley and carried off Sonoo and\n      Jadeh, and Lispeth became half-servant, half-companion to the wife of the\n      then Chaplain of Kotgarh. This was after the reign of the Moravian\n      missionaries, but before Kotgarh had quite forgotten her title of\n      \"Mistress of the Northern Hills.\"",
                "Whether Christianity improved Lispeth, or whether the gods of her own\n      people would have done as much for her under any circumstances, I do not\n      know; but she grew very lovely. When a Hill girl grows lovely, she is\n      worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon. Lispeth had a\n      Greek face -- one of those faces people paint so often, and see so\n      seldom. She was of a pale, ivory color and, for her race, extremely tall.\n      Also, she possessed eyes that were wonderful; and, had she not been\n      dressed in the abominable print-cloths affected by Missions, you would,\n      meeting her on the hill-side unexpectedly, have thought her the original\n      Diana of the Romans going out to slay.",
                "Lispeth took to Christianity readily, and did not abandon it when she\n      reached womanhood, as do some Hill girls. Her own people hated her because\n      she had, they said, become a memsahib and washed herself daily; and the\n      Chaplain's wife did not know what to do with her. Somehow, one cannot ask\n      a stately goddess, five foot ten in her shoes, to clean plates and dishes.\n      So she played with the Chaplain's children and took classes in the Sunday\n      School, and read all the books in the house, and grew more and more\n      beautiful, like the Princesses in fairy tales. The Chaplain's wife said\n      that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a nurse or something\n      \"genteel.\" But Lispeth did not want to take service. She was very happy\n      where she was.",
                "When travellers -- there were not many in those years -- came to\n      Kotgarh, Lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they\n      might take her away to Simla, or somewhere out into the unknown world.",
                "One day, a few months after she was seventeen years old, Lispeth went out\n      for a walk. She did not walk in the manner of English ladies -- a mile\n      and a half out, and a ride back again. She covered between twenty and\n      thirty miles in her little constitutionals, all about and about, between\n      Kotgarh and Narkunda. This time she came back at full dusk, stepping down\n      the breakneck descent into Kotgarh with something heavy in her arms. The\n      Chaplain's wife was dozing in the drawing-room when Lispeth came in\n      breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden. Lispeth put it down on\n      the sofa, and said simply:",
                "\"This is my husband. I found him on the Bagi Road. He has hurt himself. We\n      will nurse him, and when he is well, your husband shall marry him to me.\"",
                "This was the first mention Lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial views,\n      and the Chaplain's wife shrieked with horror. However, the man on the sofa\n      needed attention first. He was a young Englishman, and his head had been\n      cut to the bone by something jagged. Lispeth said she had found him down\n      the khud, so she had brought him in.",
                "He was breathing queerly and was unconscious.",
                "He was put to bed and tended by the Chaplain, who knew something of\n      medicine; and Lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be useful.\n      She explained to the Chaplain that this was the man she meant to marry;\n      and the Chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the impropriety of\n      her conduct. Lispeth listened quietly, and repeated her first proposition.\n      It takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out uncivilized Eastern\n      instincts, such as falling in love at first sight. Lispeth, having found\n      the man she worshipped, did not see why she should keep silent as to her\n      choice. She had no intention of being sent away, either. She was going to\n      nurse that Englishman until he was well enough to marry her. This was her\n      little programme.",
                "After a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation, the Englishman\n      recovered coherence and thanked the Chaplain and his wife, and Lispeth -- especially\n      Lispeth -- for their kindness. He was a traveller in the East, he said -- they\n      never talked about \"globe-trotters\" in those days, when the P. & O.\n      fleet was young and small -- and had come from Dehra Dun to hunt for\n      plants and butterflies among the Simla hills. No one at Simla, therefore,\n      knew anything about him. He fancied he must have fallen over the cliff\n      while stalking a fern on a rotten tree-trunk, and that his coolies must\n      have stolen his baggage and fled. He thought he would go back to Simla\n      when he was a little stronger. He desired no more mountaineering.",
                "He made small haste to go away, and recovered his strength slowly.",
                "Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife; so\n      the latter spoke to the Englishman, and told him how matters stood in\n      Lispeth's heart. He laughed a good deal, and said it was very pretty and\n      romantic, a perfect idyl of the Himalayas; but, as he was engaged to a\n      girl at Home, he fancied that nothing would happen. Certainly he would\n      behave with discretion. He did that. Still he found it very pleasant to\n      talk to Lispeth, and walk with Lispeth, and say nice things to her, and\n      call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away. It meant\n      nothing at all to him, and everything in the world to Lispeth. She was\n      very happy while the fortnight lasted, because she had found a man to\n      love.",
                "Being a savage by birth, she took no trouble to hide her feelings, and the\n      Englishman was amused. When he went away, Lispeth walked with him, up the\n      Hill as far as Narkunda, very troubled and very miserable. The Chaplain's\n      wife, being a good Christian and disliking anything in the shape of fuss\n      or scandal -- Lispeth was beyond her management entirely -- had told\n      the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he was coming back to marry her. \"She\n      is but a child, you know, and, I fear, at heart a heathen,\" said the\n      Chaplain's wife. So all the twelve miles up the hill the Englishman, with\n      his arm around Lispeth's waist, was assuring the girl that he would come\n      back and marry her; and Lispeth made him promise over and over again. She\n      wept on the Narkunda Ridge till he had passed out of sight along the\n      Muttiani path.",
                "Then she dried her tears and went in to Kotgarh again, and said to the\n      Chaplain's wife: \"He will come back and marry me. He has gone to his own\n      people to tell them so.\" And the Chaplain's wife soothed Lispeth and said:\n      \"He will come back.\" At the end of two months, Lispeth grew impatient, and\n      was told that the Englishman had gone over the seas to England. She knew\n      where England was, because she had read little geography primers; but, of\n      course, she had no conception of the nature of the sea, being a Hill girl.",
                "There was an old puzzle-map of the World in the House. Lispeth had played\n      with it when she was a child. She unearthed it again, and put it together\n      of evenings, and cried to herself, and tried to imagine where her\n      Englishman was. As she had no ideas of distance or steamboats, her notions\n      were somewhat erroneous. It would not have made the least difference had\n      she been perfectly correct; for the Englishman had no intention of coming\n      back to marry a Hill girl. He forgot all about her by the time he was\n      butterfly-hunting in Assam. He wrote a book on the East afterwards.\n      Lispeth's name did not appear.",
                "At the end of three months, Lispeth made daily pilgrimage to Narkunda to\n      see if her Englishman was coming along the road. It gave her comfort, and\n      the Chaplain's wife, finding her happier, thought that she was getting\n      over her \"barbarous and most indelicate folly.\" A little later the walks\n      ceased to help Lispeth and her temper grew very bad. The Chaplain's wife\n      thought this a profitable time to let her know the real state of affairs -- that\n      the Englishman had only promised his love to keep her quiet -- that he\n      had never meant anything, and that it was \"wrong and improper\" of Lispeth\n      to think of marriage with an Englishman, who was of a superior clay,\n      besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own people. Lispeth\n      said that all this was clearly impossible, because he had said he loved\n      her, and the Chaplain's wife had, with her own lips, asserted that the\n      Englishman was coming back.",
                "\"How can what he and you said be untrue?\" asked Lispeth.",
                "\"We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet, child,\" said the Chaplain's\n      wife.",
                "\"Then you have lied to me,\" said Lispeth, \"you and he?\"",
                "The Chaplain's wife bowed her head, and said nothing. Lispeth was silent,\n      too for a little time; then she went out down the valley, and returned in\n      the dress of a Hill girl -- infamously dirty, but without the nose and\n      ear rings. She had her hair braided into the long pig-tail, helped out\n      with black thread, that Hill women wear.",
                "\"I am going back to my own people,\" said she. \"You have killed Lispeth.\n      There is only left old Jadeh's daughter -- the daughter of a pahari and\n      the servant of Tarka Devi. You are all liars, you English.\"",
                "By the time that the Chaplain's wife had recovered from the shock of the\n      announcement that Lispeth had 'verted to her mother's gods, the girl had\n      gone; and she never came back.",
                "She took to her own unclean people savagely, as if to make up the arrears\n      of the life she had stepped out of; and, in a little time, she married a\n      wood-cutter who beat her, after the manner of paharis, and her beauty\n      faded soon.",
                "\"There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the heathen,\"\n       said the Chaplain's wife, \"and I believe that Lispeth was always at heart\n      an infidel.\" Seeing she had been taken into the Church of England at the\n      mature age of five weeks, this statement does not do credit to the\n      Chaplain's wife.",
                "Lispeth was a very old woman when she died. She always had a perfect\n      command of English, and when she was sufficiently drunk, could sometimes\n      be induced to tell the story of her first love-affair.",
                "It was hard then to realize that the bleared, wrinkled creature, so like a\n      wisp of charred rag, could ever have been \"Lispeth of the Kotgarh\n      Mission.\""

Perhaps Bremmil ought to have comforted her. He tried to\n      do so, I think; but the more he comforted the more Mrs. Bremmil grieved,\n      and, consequently, the more uncomfortable Bremmil grew. The fact was that\n      they both needed a tonic. And they got it. Mrs. Bremmil can afford to\n      laugh now, but it was no laughing matter to her at the time.",

At Simla her bye-name was the \"Stormy Petrel.\" She\n      had won that title five times to my own certain knowledge.

She annexed him publicly, and saw that\n      the public saw it. He rode with her, and walked with her, and talked with\n      her, and picnicked with her, and tiffined at Peliti's with her, till\n      people put up their eyebrows and said: \"Shocking!\" Mrs. Bremmil stayed at\n      home turning over the dead baby's frocks and crying into the empty cradle.\n      She did not care to do anything else. But some eight dear, affectionate\n      lady-friends explained the situation at length to her in case she should\n      miss the cream of it. Mrs. Bremmil listened quietly, and thanked them for\n      their good offices. She was not as clever as Mrs. Hauksbee, but she was no\n      fool. She kept her own counsel, and did not speak to Bremmil of what she\n      had heard. This is worth remembering. Speaking to, or crying over, a\n      husband never did any good yet.",

She guessed -- a woman's guess is much more accurate\n      than a man's certainty -- that he had meant to go from the first, and\n      with Mrs. Hauksbee. She sat down to think, and the outcome of her thoughts\n      was that the memory of a dead child was worth considerably less than the\n      affections of a living husband.",

Bremmil left the house at five for a ride. About half-past\n      five in the evening a large leather-covered basket came in from Phelps'\n      for Mrs. Bremmil. She was a woman who knew how to dress; and she had not\n      spent a week on designing that dress and having it gored, and hemmed, and\n      herring-boned, and tucked and rucked (or whatever the terms are) for\n      nothing. It was a gorgeous dress -- slight mourning. I can't describe\n      it, but it was what The Queen calls \"a creation\" -- a thing that hit\n      you straight between the eyes and made you gasp. She had not much heart\n      for what she was going to do; but as she glanced at the long mirror she\n      had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so well in her\n      life. She was a large blonde and, when she chose, carried herself\n      superbly.",

Mrs. Hauksbee caught her eye once; and she knew it was war -- real\n      war -- between them. She started handicapped in the struggle, for she\n      had ordered Bremmil about just the least little bit in the world too much;\n      and he was beginning to resent it.

                "He stared at her from doorways, and glared at her from passages as she\n      went about with her partners; and the more he stared, the more taken was\n      he.

The Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the expedition and\n      went to The Boy's room, where he rummaged.",

                "\"Very well,\" said the Major; \"you must come out with me now -- at once -- in\n      an ekka to the Canal to shoot black-buck. Go and put on shikar-kit -- quick -- and\n      drive here with a gun.\"",
                "The Major was a masterful man; and I knew that he would not give orders\n      for nothing. So I obeyed, and on return found the Major packed up in an\n      ekka -- gun-cases and food slung below -- all ready for a\n      shooting-trip.",
                "He dismissed the driver and drove himself.

                "The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare, lime-washed\n      room. He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver. The\n      gun-cases were still strapped, so was the bedding, and on the table lay\n      The Boy's writing-case with photographs. He had gone away to die like a\n      poisoned rat!",
                "The Major said to himself softly: \"Poor Boy! Poor, POOR devil!\" Then he\n      turned away from the bed and said: \"I want your help in this business.\"",
                "Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand, I saw exactly what that help\n      would be, so I passed over to the table, took a chair, lit a cheroot, and\n      began to go through the writing-case; the Major looking over my shoulder\n      and repeating to himself: \"We came too late! -- Like a rat in a hole! -- Poor,\n      POOR devil!\"",
                "The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people, and to\n      his Colonel, and to a girl at Home; and as soon as he had finished, must\n      have shot himself, for he had been dead a long time when we came in.",
                "I read all that he had written, and passed over each sheet to the Major as\n      I finished it.",
                "We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything. He\n      wrote about \"disgrace which he was unable to bear\" -- \"indelible shame\" -- \"criminal\n      folly\" -- \"wasted life,\" and so on; besides a lot of private things to\n      his Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into print. The letter to\n      the girl at Home was the most pitiful of all; and I choked as I read it.\n      The Major made no attempt to keep dry-eyed. I respected him for that. He\n      read and rocked himself to and fro, and simply cried like a woman without\n      caring to hide it. The letters were so dreary and hopeless and touching.\n      We forgot all about The Boy's follies, and only thought of the poor Thing\n      on the charpoy and the scrawled sheets in our hands. It was utterly\n      impossible to let the letters go Home.",
                "They would have broken his Father's heart and killed his Mother after\n      killing her belief in her son.",
                "At last the Major dried his eyes openly, and said: \"Nice sort of thing to\n      spring on an English family! What shall we do?\"",
                "I said, knowing what the Major had brought me but for: \"The Boy died of\n      cholera. We were with him at the time. We can't commit ourselves to\n      half-measures. Come along.\"",
                "Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part in -- the\n      concoction of a big, written lie, bolstered with evidence, to soothe The\n      Boy's people at Home. I began the rough draft of a letter, the Major\n      throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the stuff that\n      The Boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace. It was a hot, still\n      evening when we began, and the lamp burned very badly. In due course I got\n      the draft to my satisfaction, setting forth how The Boy was the pattern of\n      all virtues, beloved by his regiment, with every promise of a great career\n      before him, and so on; how we had helped him through the sickness -- it\n      was no time for little lies, you will understand -- and how he had died\n      without pain. I choked while I was putting down these things and thinking\n      of the poor people who would read them.",
                "Then I laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair, and the laughter mixed\n      itself up with the choke -- and the Major said that we both wanted\n      drinks.",
                "I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was\n      finished. It had not the least effect on us. Then we took off The Boy's\n      watch, locket, and rings.",
                "Lastly, the Major said: \"We must send a lock of hair too. A woman values\n      that.\"",
                "But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send.",
                "The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily. I cut off a piece\n      of the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the\n      packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me\n      again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and we both knew\n      that the worst part of the work was to come.",
                "We sealed up the packet, photographs, locket, seals, ring, letter, and\n      lock of hair with The Boy's sealing-wax and The Boy's seal.",
                "Then the Major said: \"For God's sake let's get outside -- away from the\n      room -- and think!\"",
                "We went outside, and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour, eating\n      and drinking what we had with us, until the moon rose. I know now exactly\n      how a murderer feels. Finally, we forced ourselves back to the room with\n      the lamp and the Other Thing in it, and began to take up the next piece of\n      work. I am not going to write about this. It was too horrible. We burned\n      the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal; we took up the matting\n      of the room and treated that in the same way. I went off to a village and\n      borrowed two big hoes -- I did not want the villagers to help -- while\n      the Major arranged -- the other matters. It took us four hours' hard\n      work to make the grave. As we worked, we argued out whether it was right\n      to say as much as we remembered of the Burial of the Dead.",
                "We compromised things by saying the Lord's Prayer with a private\n      unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy. Then we filled in\n      the grave and went into the verandah -- not the house -- to lie down\n      to sleep. We were dead-tired.",
                "When we woke the Major said, wearily: \"We can't go back till tomorrow. We\n      must give him a decent time to die in. He died early THIS morning,\n      remember. That seems more natural.\" So the Major must have been lying\n      awake all the time, thinking.",
                "I said: \"Then why didn't we bring the body back to the cantonments?\"",
                "The Major thought for a minute: -- \"Because the people bolted when they\n      heard of the cholera. And the ekka has gone!\"",
                "That was strictly true. We had forgotten all about the ekka-pony, and he\n      had gone home.",
                "So, we were left there alone, all that stifling day, in the Canal Rest\n      House, testing and re-testing our story of The Boy's death to see if it\n      was weak at any point. A native turned up in the afternoon, but we said\n      that a Sahib was dead of cholera, and he ran away. As the dusk gathered,\n      the Major told me all his fears about The Boy, and awful stories of\n      suicide or nearly-carried-out suicide -- tales that made one's hair\n      crisp. He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the\n      Shadow as the Boy, when he was young and new to the country; so he\n      understood how things fought together in The Boy's poor jumbled head. He\n      also said that youngsters, in their repentant moments, consider their sins\n      much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are. We talked\n      together all through the evening, and rehearsed the story of the death of\n      The Boy. As soon as the moon was up, and The Boy, theoretically, just\n      buried, we struck across country for the Station. We walked from eight\n      till six o'clock in the morning; but though we were dead-tired, we did not\n      forget to go to The Boy's room and put away his revolver with the proper\n      amount of cartridges in the pouch. Also to set his writing-case on the\n      table. We found the Colonel and reported the death, feeling more like\n      murderers than ever. Then we went to bed and slept the clock round; for\n      there was no more in us.",
                "The tale had credence as long as was necessary, for every one forgot about\n      The Boy before a fortnight was over. Many people, however, found time to\n      say that the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in the body\n      for a regimental funeral. The saddest thing of all was a letter from The\n      Boy's mother to the Major and me -- with big inky blisters all over the\n      sheet. She wrote the sweetest possible things about our great kindness,\n      and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she lived.",
                "All things considered, she WAS under an obligation; but not exactly as she\n      meant."

He held the extraordinary theory\n      that a Policeman in India should try to know as much about the natives as\n      the natives themselves. Now, in the whole of Upper India, there is only\n      ONE man who can pass for Hindu or Mohammedan, chamar or faquir, as he\n      pleases. He is feared and respected by the natives from the Ghor Kathri to\n      the Jamma Musjid; and he is supposed to have the gift of invisibility and\n      executive control over many Devils. But what good has this done him with\n      the Government? None in the world. He has never got Simla for his charge;\n      and his name is almost unknown to Englishmen.",
                "Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model; and,\n      following out his absurd theory, dabbled in unsavory places no respectable\n      man would think of exploring -- all among the native riff-raff. He\n      educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years, and people could\n      not appreciate it. He was perpetually \"going Fantee\" among the natives,\n      which, of course, no man with any sense believes in. He was initiated into\n      the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once, when he was on leave; he knew the\n      Lizard-Song of the Sansis, and the Halli-Hukk dance, which is a religious\n      can-can of a startling kind. When a man knows who dances the Halli-Hukk,\n      and how, and when, and where, he knows something to be proud of. He has\n      gone deeper than the skin. But Strickland was not proud, though he had\n      helped once, at Jagadhri, at the Painting of the Death Bull, which no\n      Englishman must even look upon; had mastered the thieves'-patter of the\n      changars; had taken a Eusufzai horse-thief alone near Attock; and had\n      stood under the mimbar-board of a Border mosque and conducted service in\n      the manner of a Sunni Mollah.",
                "His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the\n      gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar, and there picking up the threads of the\n      great Nasiban Murder Case. But people said, justly enough: \"Why on earth\n      can't Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary, and recruit,\n      and keep quiet, instead of showing up the incapacity of his seniors?\" So\n      the Nasiban Murder Case did him no good departmentally; but, after his\n      first feeling of wrath, he returned to his outlandish custom of prying\n      into native life. By the way, when a man once acquires a taste for this\n      particular amusement, it abides with him all his days. It is the most\n      fascinating thing in the world; Love not excepted. Where other men took\n      ten days to the Hills, Strickland took leave for what he called shikar,\n      put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time, stepped down into\n      the brown crowd, and was swallowed up for a while. He was a quiet, dark\n      young fellow -- spare, black-eyes -- and, when he was not thinking\n      of something else, a very interesting companion. Strickland on Native\n      Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing. Natives hated Strickland;\n      but they were afraid of him. He knew too much.",
                "When the Youghals came into the station, Strickland -- very gravely, as\n      he did everything -- fell in love with Miss Youghal; and she, after a\n      while, fell in love with him because she could not understand him. Then\n      Strickland told the parents; but Mrs. Youghal said she was not going to\n      throw her daughter into the worst paid Department in the Empire, and old\n      Youghal said, in so many words, that he mistrusted Strickland's ways and\n      works, and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter any more.\n      \"Very well,\" said Strickland, for he did not wish to make his lady-love's\n      life a burden. After one long talk with Miss Youghal he dropped the\n      business entirely.",
                "The Youghals went up to Simla in April.",
                "In July, Strickland secured three months' leave on \"urgent private\n      affairs.\" He locked up his house -- though not a native in the\n      Providence would wittingly have touched \"Estreekin Sahib's\" gear for the\n      world -- and went down to see a friend of his, an old dyer, at Tarn\n      Taran.",
                "Here all trace of him was lost, until a sais met me on the Simla Mall with\n      this extraordinary note:",

                "\"Please give bearer a box of cheroots -- Supers, No. I, for preference.\n      They are freshest at the Club. I'll repay when I reappear; but at present\n      I'm out of Society.",

                "\"E. STRICKLAND.\"",
                "I ordered two boxes, and handed them over to the sais with my love.",
                "That sais was Strickland, and he was in old Youghal's employ, attached to\n      Miss Youghal's Arab. The poor fellow was suffering for an English smoke,\n      and knew that whatever happened I should hold my tongue till the business\n      was over.",
                "Later on, Mrs. Youghal, who was wrapped up in her servants, began talking\n      at houses where she called of her paragon among saises -- the man who\n      was never too busy to get up in the morning and pick flowers for the\n      breakfast-table, and who blacked -- actually BLACKED -- the hoofs of\n      his horse like a London coachman! The turnout of Miss Youghal's Arab was a\n      wonder and a delight. Strickland -- Dulloo, I mean -- found his\n      reward in the pretty things that Miss Youghal said to him when she went\n      out riding. Her parents were pleased to find she had forgotten all her\n      foolishness for young Strickland and said she was a good girl.",
                "Strickland vows that the two months of his service were the most rigid\n      mental discipline he has ever gone through. Quite apart from the little\n      fact that the wife of one of his fellow-saises fell in love with him and\n      then tried to poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing to do\n      with her, he had to school himself into keeping quiet when Miss Youghal\n      went out riding with some man who tried to flirt with her, and he was\n      forced to trot behind carrying the blanket and hearing every word! Also,\n      he had to keep his temper when he was slanged in \"Benmore\" porch by a\n      policeman -- especially once when he was abused by a Naik he had\n      himself recruited from Isser Jang village -- or, worse still, when a\n      young subaltern called him a pig for not making way quickly enough.",
                "But the life had its compensations. He obtained great insight into the\n      ways and thefts of saises -- enough, he says, to have summarily\n      convicted half the chamar population of the Punjab if he had been on\n      business. He became one of the leading players at knuckle-bones, which all\n      jhampanis and many saises play while they are waiting outside the\n      Government House or the Gaiety Theatre of nights; he learned to smoke\n      tobacco that was three-fourths cowdung; and he heard the wisdom of the\n      grizzled Jemadar of the Government House saises, whose words are valuable.\n      He saw many things which amused him; and he states, on honor, that no man\n      can appreciate Simla properly, till he has seen it from the sais's point\n      of view.",
                "He also says that, if he chose to write all he saw, his head would be\n      broken in several places.",
                "Strickland's account of the agony he endured on wet nights, hearing the\n      music and seeing the lights in \"Benmore,\" with his toes tingling for a\n      waltz and his head in a horse-blanket, is rather amusing. One of these\n      days, Strickland is going to write a little book on his experiences. That\n      book will be worth buying; and even more, worth suppressing.",
                "Thus, he served faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel; and his leave was\n      nearly at an end when the explosion came. He had really done his best to\n      keep his temper in the hearing of the flirtations I have mentioned; but he\n      broke down at last. An old and very distinguished General took Miss\n      Youghal for a ride, and began that specially offensive\n      \"you're-only-a-little-girl\" sort of flirtation -- most difficult for a\n      woman to turn aside deftly, and most maddening to listen to. Miss Youghal\n      was shaking with fear at the things he said in the hearing of her sais.\n      Dulloo -- Strickland -- stood it as long as he could. Then he caught\n      hold of the General's bridle, and, in most fluent English, invited him to\n      step off and be heaved over the cliff. Next minute Miss Youghal began\n      crying; and Strickland saw that he had hopelessly given himself away, and\n      everything was over.",
                "The General nearly had a fit, while Miss Youghal was sobbing out the story\n      of the disguise and the engagement that wasn't recognized by the parents.\n      Strickland was furiously angry with himself and more angry with the\n      General for forcing his hand; so he said nothing, but held the horse's\n      head and prepared to thrash the General as some sort of satisfaction, but\n      when the General had thoroughly grasped the story, and knew who Strickland\n      was, he began to puff and blow in the saddle, and nearly rolled off with\n      laughing. He said Strickland deserved a V. C., if it were only for putting\n      on a sais's blanket. Then he called himself names, and vowed that he\n      deserved a thrashing, but he was too old to take it from Strickland. Then\n      he complimented Miss Youghal on her lover.",
                "The scandal of the business never struck him; for he was a nice old man,\n      with a weakness for flirtations. Then he laughed again, and said that old\n      Youghal was a fool. Strickland let go of the cob's head, and suggested\n      that the General had better help them, if that was his opinion. Strickland\n      knew Youghal's weakness for men with titles and letters after their names\n      and high official position.",
                "\"It's rather like a forty-minute farce,\" said the General, \"but begad, I\n      WILL help, if it's only to escape that tremendous thrashing I deserved. Go\n      along to your home, my sais-Policeman, and change into decent kit, and\n      I'll attack Mr. Youghal. Miss Youghal, may I ask you to canter home and\n      wait?\".........",
                "About seven minutes later, there was a wild hurroosh at the Club.",
                "A sais, with a blanket and head-rope, was asking all the men he knew: \"For\n      Heaven's sake lend me decent clothes!\" As the men did not recognize him,\n      there were some peculiar scenes before Strickland could get a hot bath,\n      with soda in it, in one room, a shirt here, a collar there, a pair of\n      trousers elsewhere, and so on. He galloped off, with half the Club\n      wardrobe on his back, and an utter stranger's pony under him, to the house\n      of old Youghal.",
                "The General, arrayed in purple and fine linen, was before him.",
                "What the General had said Strickland never knew, but Youghal received\n      Strickland with moderate civility; and Mrs. Youghal, touched by the\n      devotion of the transformed Dulloo, was almost kind.",
                "The General beamed, and chuckled, and Miss Youghal came in, and almost\n      before old Youghal knew where he was, the parental consent had been\n      wrenched out and Strickland had departed with Miss Youghal to the\n      Telegraph Office to wire for his kit. The final embarrassment was when an\n      utter stranger attacked him on the Mall and asked for the stolen pony.",
                "So, in the end, Strickland and Miss Youghal were married, on the strict\n      understanding that Strickland should drop his old ways, and stick to\n      Departmental routine, which pays best and leads to Simla.",
                "Strickland was far too fond of his wife, just then, to break his word, but\n      it was a sore trial to him; for the streets and the bazars, and the sounds\n      in them, were full of meaning to Strickland, and these called to him to\n      come back and take up his wanderings and his discoveries. Some day, I will\n      tell you how he broke his promise to help a friend. That was long since,\n      and he has, by this time, been nearly spoilt for what he would call\n      shikar. He is forgetting the slang, and the beggar's cant, and the marks,\n      and the signs, and the drift of the undercurrents, which, if a man would\n      master, he must always continue to learn.",
                "But he fills in his Departmental returns beautifully."

                "When the Gravesend tender left the P. & 0. steamer for Bombay and went\n      back to catch the train to Town, there were many people in it crying. But\n      the one who wept most, and most openly was Miss Agnes Laiter. She had\n      reason to cry, because the only man she ever loved -- or ever could\n      love, so she said -- was going out to India; and India, as every one\n      knows, is divided equally between jungle, tigers, cobras, cholera, and\n      sepoys.",
                "Phil Garron, leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain, felt very\n      unhappy too; but he did not cry. He was sent out to \"tea.\" What \"tea\"\n       meant he had not the vaguest idea, but fancied that he would have to ride\n      on a prancing horse over hills covered with tea-vines, and draw a\n      sumptuous salary for doing so; and he was very grateful to his uncle for\n      getting him the berth. He was really going to reform all his slack,\n      shiftless ways, save a large proportion of his magnificent salary yearly,\n      and, in a very short time, return to marry Agnes Laiter. Phil Garron had\n      been lying loose on his friends' hands for three years, and, as he had\n      nothing to do, he naturally fell in love. He was very nice; but he was not\n      strong in his views and opinions and principles, and though he never came\n      to actual grief his friends were thankful when he said good-bye, and went\n      out to this mysterious \"tea\" business near Darjiling. They said: -- \"God\n      bless you, dear boy! Let us never see your face again,\" -- or at least\n      that was what Phil was given to understand.",
                "When he sailed, he was very full of a great plan to prove himself several\n      hundred times better than any one had given him credit for -- to work\n      like a horse, and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter. He had many good points\n      besides his good looks; his only fault being that he was weak, the least\n      little bit in the world weak. He had as much notion of economy as the\n      Morning Sun; and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item, and say:\n      \"Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless.\" Nor could you point out\n      any particular vice in his character; but he was \"unsatisfactory\" and as\n      workable as putty.",
                "Agnes Laiter went about her duties at home -- her family objected to\n      the engagement -- with red eyes, while Phil was sailing to Darjiling -- \"a\n      port on the Bengal Ocean,\" as his mother used to tell her friends. He was\n      popular enough on board ship, made many acquaintances and a moderately\n      large liquor bill, and sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each port.\n      Then he fell to work on this plantation, somewhere between Darjiling and\n      Kangra, and, though the salary and the horse and the work were not quite\n      all he had fancied, he succeeded fairly well, and gave himself much\n      unnecessary credit for his perseverance.",
                "In the course of time, as he settled more into collar, and his work grew\n      fixed before him, the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only\n      came when he was at leisure, which was not often. He would forget all\n      about her for a fortnight, and remember her with a start, like a\n      school-boy who has forgotten to learn his lesson.",
                "She did not forget Phil, because she was of the kind that never forgets.\n      Only, another man -- a really desirable young man -- presented\n      himself before Mrs. Laiter; and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as\n      far off as ever; and his letters were so unsatisfactory; and there was a\n      certain amount of domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl; and the\n      young man really was an eligible person as incomes go; and the end of all\n      things was that Agnes married him, and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind of a\n      letter to Phil in the wilds of Darjiling, and said she should never know a\n      happy moment all the rest of her life. Which was a true prophecy.",
                "Phil got that letter, and held himself ill-treated. This was two years\n      after he had come out; but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter,\n      and looking at her photograph, and patting himself on the back for being\n      one of the most constant lovers in history, and warming to the work as he\n      went on, he really fancied that he had been very hardly used. He sat down\n      and wrote one final letter -- a really pathetic \"world without end,\n      amen,\" epistle; explaining how he would be true to Eternity, and that all\n      women were very much alike, and he would hide his broken heart, etc.,\n      etc.; but if, at any future time, etc., etc., he could afford to wait,\n      etc., etc., unchanged affections, etc., etc., return to her old love,\n      etc., etc., for eight closely-written pages. From an artistic point of\n      view, it was very neat work, but an ordinary Philistine, who knew the\n      state of Phil's real feelings -- not the ones he rose to as he went on\n      writing -- would have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish work of\n      a thoroughly mean and selfish, weak man. But this verdict would have been\n      incorrect. Phil paid for the postage, and felt every word he had written\n      for at least two days and a half.",
                "It was the last flicker before the light went out.",
                "That letter made Agnes Laiter very unhappy, and she cried and put it away\n      in her desk, and became Mrs. Somebody Else for the good of her family.\n      Which is the first duty of every Christian maid.",
                "Phil went his ways, and thought no more of his letter, except as an artist\n      thinks of a neatly touched-in sketch. His ways were not bad, but they were\n      not altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya, the daughter of\n      a Rajput ex-Subadar-Major of our Native Army. The girl had a strain of\n      Hill blood in her, and, like the Hill women, was not a purdah nashin.\n      Where Phil met her, or how he heard of her, does not matter. She was a\n      good girl and handsome, and, in her way, very clever and shrewd; though,\n      of course, a little hard. It is to be remembered that Phil was living very\n      comfortably, denying himself no small luxury, never putting by an anna,\n      very satisfied with himself and his good intentions, was dropping all his\n      English correspondents one by one, and beginning more and more to look\n      upon this land as his home. Some men fall this way; and they are of no use\n      afterwards. The climate where he was stationed was good, and it really did\n      not seem to him that there was anything to go Home for.",
                "He did what many planters have done before him -- that is to say, he\n      made up his mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down. He was seven and\n      twenty then, with a long life before him, but no spirit to go through with\n      it. So he married Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church, and some\n      fellow-planters said he was a fool, and some said he was a wise man.\n      Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl, and, in spite of her reverence for\n      an Englishman, had a reasonable estimate of her husband's weaknesses. She\n      managed him tenderly, and became, in less than a year, a very passable\n      imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage. [It is curious to\n      think that a Hill man, after a lifetime's education, is a Hill man still;\n      but a Hill woman can in six months master most of the ways of her English\n      sisters. There was a coolie woman once. But that is another story.]\n      Dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow, and looked well.",
                "Meantime the letter lay in Agnes's desk, and now and again she would think\n      of poor resolute hard-working Phil among the cobras and tigers of\n      Darjiling, toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him. Her\n      husband was worth ten Phils, except that he had rheumatism of the heart.\n      Three years after he was married -- and after he had tried Nice and\n      Algeria for his complaint -- he went to Bombay, where he died, and set\n      Agnes free. Being a devout woman, she looked on his death and the place of\n      it, as a direct interposition of Providence, and when she had recovered\n      from the shock, she took out and reread Phil's letter with the \"etc.,\n      etc.,\" and the big dashes, and the little dashes, and kissed it several\n      times. No one knew her in Bombay; she had her husband's income, which was\n      a large one, and Phil was close at hand. It was wrong and improper, of\n      course, but she decided, as heroines do in novels, to find her old lover,\n      to offer him her hand and her gold, and with him spend the rest of her\n      life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls. She sat for two months,\n      alone in Watson's Hotel, elaborating this decision, and the picture was a\n      pretty one. Then she set out in search of Phil Garron, Assistant on a tea\n      plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable name..........",
                "She found him. She spent a month over it, for his plantation was not in\n      the Darjiling district at all, but nearer Kangra. Phil was very little\n      altered, and Dunmaya was very nice to her.",
                "Now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that Phil, who\n      really is not worth thinking of twice, was and is loved by Dunmaya, and\n      more than loved by Agnes, the whole of whose life he seems to have spoilt.",
                "Worst of all, Dunmaya is making a decent man of him; and he will be\n      ultimately saved from perdition through her training.",

If you hit a pony over\n      the nose at the outset of your acquaintance, he may not love you, but he\n      will take a deep interest in your movements ever afterwards. The elder\n      Miss Copleigh was nice, plump, winning and pretty. The younger was not so\n      pretty, and, from men disregarding the hint set forth above, her style was\n      repellant and unattractive. Both girls had, practically, the same figure,\n      and there was a strong likeness between them in look and voice; though no\n      one could doubt for an instant which was the nicer of the two.",
                "Saumarez made up his mind, as soon as they came into the station from\n      Behar, to marry the elder one. At least, we all made sure that he would,\n      which comes to the same thing. She was two and twenty, and he was\n      thirty-three, with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees a\n      month. So the match, as we arranged it, was in every way a good one.\n      Saumarez was his name, and summary was his nature, as a man once said.\n      Having drafted his Resolution, he formed a Select Committee of One to sit\n      upon it, and resolved to take his time. In our unpleasant slang, the\n      Copleigh girls \"hunted in couples.\" That is to say, you could do nothing\n      with one without the other. They were very loving sisters; but their\n      mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient. Saumarez held the\n      balance-hair true between them, and none but himself could have said to\n      which side his heart inclined; though every one guessed. He rode with them\n      a good deal and danced with them, but he never succeeded in detaching them\n      from each other for any length of time.",
                "Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust, each\n      fearing that the other would steal a march on her. But that has nothing to\n      do with a man. Saumarez was silent for good or bad, and as business -- likely\n      attentive as he could be, having due regard to his work and his polo.\n      Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him.",
                "As the hot weather drew nearer, and Saumarez made no sign, women said that\n      you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girls -- that they were\n      looking strained, anxious, and irritable. Men are quite blind in these\n      matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their\n      composition, in which case it does not matter what they say or think. I\n      maintain it was the hot April days that took the color out of the Copleigh\n      girls' cheeks. They should have been sent to the Hills early. No one -- man\n      or woman -- feels an angel when the hot weather is approaching. The\n      younger sister grew more cynical -- not to say acid -- in her ways;\n      and the winningness of the elder wore thin. There was more effort in it.",
                "Now the Station wherein all these things happened was, though not a little\n      one, off the line of rail, and suffered through want of attention. There\n      were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking of, and it was\n      nearly a day's journey to come into Lahore for a dance. People were\n      grateful for small things to interest them.",
                "About the beginning of May, and just before the final exodus of\n      Hill-goers, when the weather was very hot and there were not more than\n      twenty people in the Station, Saumarez gave a moonlight riding-picnic at\n      an old tomb, six miles away, near the bed of the river. It was a \"Noah's\n      Ark\" picnic; and there was to be the usual arrangement of quarter-mile\n      intervals between each couple, on account of the dust. Six couples came\n      altogether, including chaperons. Moonlight picnics are useful just at the\n      very end of the season, before all the girls go away to the Hills. They\n      lead to understandings, and should be encouraged by chaperones; especially\n      those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits. I knew a case once. But\n      that is another story. That picnic was called the \"Great Pop Picnic,\"\n       because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to the eldest Miss\n      Copleigh; and, beside his affair, there was another which might possibly\n      come to happiness.",
                "The social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing.",
                "We met at the parade-ground at ten: the night was fearfully hot.",
                "The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but anything was better than\n      sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full\n      moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the\n      Copleigh girls, and I loitered at the tail of the procession, wondering\n      with whom Saumarez would ride home. Every one was happy and contented; but\n      we all felt that things were going to happen. We rode slowly: and it was\n      nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb, facing the ruined tank, in\n      the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink. I was late in\n      coming up; and before I went into the garden, I saw that the horizon to\n      the north carried a faint, dun-colored feather. But no one would have\n      thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an entertainment as this picnic -- and\n      a dust-storm, more or less, does no great harm.",
                "We gathered by the tank. Some one had brought out a banjo -- which is a\n      most sentimental instrument -- and three or four of us sang.",
                "You must not laugh at this. Our amusements in out-of-the-way Stations are\n      very few indeed. Then we talked in groups or together, lying under the\n      trees, with the sun-baked roses dropping their petals on our feet, until\n      supper was ready. It was a beautiful supper, as cold and as iced as you\n      could wish; and we stayed long over it.",
                "I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter; but nobody seemed\n      to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began lashing\n      the orange-trees with a sound like the noise of the sea. Before we knew\n      where we were, the dust-storm was on us, and everything was roaring,\n      whirling darkness. The supper-table was blown bodily into the tank. We\n      were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it might be\n      blown down. So we felt our way to the orange-trees where the horses were\n      picketed and waited for the storm to blow over. Then the little light that\n      was left vanished, and you could not see your hand before your face. The\n      air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed of the river, that filled\n      boots and pockets and drifted down necks and coated eyebrows and\n      moustaches. It was one of the worst dust-storms of the year.",
                "We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses, with the\n      thunder clattering overhead, and the lightning spurting like water from a\n      sluice, all ways at once. There was no danger, of course, unless the\n      horses broke loose. I was standing with my head downward and my hands over\n      my mouth, hearing the trees thrashing each other. I could not see who was\n      next me till the flashes came.",
                "Then I found that I was packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss Copleigh,\n      with my own horse just in front of me. I recognized the eldest Miss\n      Copleigh, because she had a pagri round her helmet, and the younger had\n      not. All the electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was\n      quivering and tingling from head to foot -- exactly as a corn shoots\n      and tingles before rain. It was a grand storm.",
                "The wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in\n      great heaps; and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the Day\n      of Judgment.",
                "The storm lulled slightly after the first half-hour, and I heard a\n      despairing little voice close to my ear, saying to itself, quietly and\n      softly, as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind: \"O my God!\"\n       Then the younger Miss Copleigh stumbled into my arms, saying: \"Where is my\n      horse? Get my horse. I want to go home. I WANT to go home. Take me home.\"",
                "I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her; so\n      I said there was no danger, but she must wait till the storm blew over.\n      She answered: \"It is not THAT! It is not THAT! I want to go home! O take\n      me away from here!\"",
                "I said that she could not go till the light came; but I felt her brush\n      past me and go away. It was too dark to see where. Then the whole sky was\n      split open with one tremendous flash, as if the end of the world were\n      coming, and all the women shrieked.",
                "Almost directly after this, I felt a man's hand on my shoulder and heard\n      Saumarez bellowing in my ear. Through the rattling of the trees and\n      howling of the wind, I did not catch his words at once, but at last I\n      heard him say: \"I've proposed to the wrong one! What shall I do?\" Saumarez\n      had no occasion to make this confidence to me. I was never a friend of\n      his, nor am I now; but I fancy neither of us were ourselves just then. He\n      was shaking as he stood with excitement, and I was feeling queer all over\n      with the electricity.",
                "I could not think of anything to say except: -- \"More fool you for\n      proposing in a dust-storm.\" But I did not see how that would improve the\n      mistake.",
                "Then he shouted: \"Where's Edith -- Edith Copleigh?\" Edith was the\n      youngest sister. I answered out of my astonishment: -- \"What do you\n      want with HER?\" Would you believe it, for the next two minutes, he and I\n      were shouting at each other like maniacs -- he vowing that it was the\n      youngest sister he had meant to propose to all along, and I telling him\n      till my throat was hoarse that he must have made a mistake! I can't\n      account for this except, again, by the fact that we were neither of us\n      ourselves. Everything seemed to me like a bad dream -- from the\n      stamping of the horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the story of\n      his loving Edith Copleigh since the first. He was still clawing my\n      shoulder and begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was, when another\n      lull came and brought light with it, and we saw the dust-cloud forming on\n      the plain in front of us. So we knew the worst was over. The moon was low\n      down, and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about an\n      hour before the real one. But the light was very faint, and the dun cloud\n      roared like a bull. I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone; and as I was\n      wondering I saw three things together: First Maud Copleigh's face come\n      smiling out of the darkness and move towards Saumarez, who was standing by\n      me. I heard the girl whisper, \"George,\" and slide her arm through the arm\n      that was not clawing my shoulder, and I saw that look on her face which\n      only comes once or twice in a lifetime -- when a woman is perfectly\n      happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeous-colored fire and the\n      Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved. At the same time, I\n      saw Saumarez's face as he heard Maud Copleigh's voice, and fifty yards\n      away from the clump of orange-trees I saw a brown holland habit getting\n      upon a horse.",
                "It must have been my state of over-excitement that made me so quick to\n      meddle with what did not concern me. Saumarez was moving off to the habit;\n      but I pushed him back and said: -- \"Stop here and explain. I'll fetch\n      her back!\" and I ran out to get at my own horse. I had a perfectly\n      unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order, and\n      that Saumarez's first care was to wipe the happy look out of Maud\n      Copleigh's face. All the time I was linking up the curb-chain I wondered\n      how he would do it.",
                "I cantered after Edith Copleigh, thinking to bring her back slowly on some\n      pretence or another. But she galloped away as soon as she saw me, and I\n      was forced to ride after her in earnest. She called back over her shoulder -- \"Go\n      away! I'm going home. Oh, go away!\" two or three times; but my business\n      was to catch her first, and argue later. The ride just fitted in with the\n      rest of the evil dream. The ground was very bad, and now and again we\n      rushed through the whirling, choking \"dust-devils\" in the skirts of the\n      flying storm. There was a burning hot wind blowing that brought up a\n      stench of stale brick-kilns with it; and through the half light and\n      through the dust-devils, across that desolate plain, flickered the brown\n      holland habit on the gray horse. She headed for the Station at first. Then\n      she wheeled round and set off for the river through beds of burnt down\n      jungle-grass, bad even to ride a pig over. In cold blood I should never\n      have dreamed of going over such a country at night, but it seemed quite\n      right and natural with the lightning crackling overhead, and a reek like\n      the smell of the Pit in my nostrils. I rode and shouted, and she bent\n      forward and lashed her horse, and the aftermath of the dust-storm came up\n      and caught us both, and drove us downwind like pieces of paper.",
                "I don't know how far we rode; but the drumming of the horse-hoofs and the\n      roar of the wind and the race of the faint blood-red moon through the\n      yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years, and I was\n      literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray\n      stumbled, recovered himself, and pulled up dead lame. My brute was used up\n      altogether. Edith Copleigh was in a sad state, plastered with dust, her\n      helmet off, and crying bitterly. \"Why can't you let me alone?\" she said.\n      \"I only wanted to get away and go home. Oh, PLEASE let me go!\"",
                "\"You have got to come back with me, Miss Copleigh. Saumarez has something\n      to say to you.\"",
                "It was a foolish way of putting it; but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh; and,\n      though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse, I could not tell\n      her in as many words what Saumarez had told me. I thought he could do that\n      better himself. All her pretence about being tired and wanting to go home\n      broke down, and she rocked herself to and fro in the saddle as she sobbed,\n      and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward. I am not going to repeat\n      what she said, because she was utterly unstrung.",
                "This, if you please, was the cynical Miss Copleigh. Here was I, almost an\n      utter stranger to her, trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her and she\n      was to come back to hear him say so! I believe I made myself understood,\n      for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble somehow, and we set\n      off for the tomb, while the storm went thundering down to Umballa and a\n      few big drops of warm rain fell. I found out that she had been standing\n      close to Saumarez when he proposed to her sister and had wanted to go home\n      and cry in peace, as an English girl should. She dabbled her eyes with her\n      pocket-handkerchief as we went along, and babbled to me out of sheer\n      lightness of heart and hysteria. That was perfectly unnatural; and yet, it\n      seemed all right at the time and in the place. All the world was only the\n      two Copleigh girls, Saumarez and I, ringed in with the lightning and the\n      dark; and the guidance of this misguided world seemed to lie in my hands.",
                "When we returned to the tomb in the deep, dead stillness that followed the\n      storm, the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away. They were\n      waiting for our return. Saumarez most of all.",
                "His face was white and drawn. As Miss Copleigh and I limped up, he came\n      forward to meet us, and, when he helped her down from her saddle, he\n      kissed her before all the picnic. It was like a scene in a theatre, and\n      the likeness was heightened by all the dust-white, ghostly-looking men and\n      women under the orange-trees, clapping their hands, as if they were\n      watching a play -- at Saumarez's choice. I never knew anything so\n      un-English in my life.",
                "Lastly, Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come out to\n      look for us, and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud Copleigh?\n      Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I said.",
                "So, we formed up, six couples in all, and went back two by two; Saumarez\n      walking at the side of Edith Copleigh, who was riding his horse.",
                "The air was cleared; and little by little, as the sun rose, I felt we were\n      all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that the \"Great\n      Pop Picnic\" was a thing altogether apart and out of the world -- never\n      to happen again. It had gone with the dust-storm and the tingle in the hot\n      air.",
                "I felt tired and limp, and a good deal ashamed of myself as I went in for\n      a bath and some sleep.",
                "There is a woman's version of this story, but it will never be written.\n      ... unless Maud Copleigh cares to try."

                "Thus, for a season, they fought it fair -- \n     She and his cousin May -- \n   Tactful, talented, debonnaire,\n     Decorous foes were they;\n   But never can battle of man compare\n     With merciless feminine fray.\n               -- Two and One.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex. Here is a story to prove\n      this; and you can believe just as much as ever you please.",
                "Pluffles was a subaltern in the \"Unmentionables.\" He was callow, even for\n      a subaltern. He was callow all over -- like a canary that had not\n      finished fledging itself. The worst of it was he had three times as much\n      money as was good for him; Pluffles' Papa being a rich man and Pluffles\n      being the only son. Pluffles' Mamma adored him. She was only a little less\n      callow than Pluffles and she believed everything he said.",
                "Pluffles' weakness was not believing what people said. He preferred what\n      he called \"trusting to his own judgment.\" He had as much judgment as he\n      had seat or hands; and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or\n      twice. But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at\n      Simla -- some years ago, when he was four-and-twenty.",
                "He began by trusting to his own judgment, as usual, and the result was\n      that, after a time, he was bound hand and foot to Mrs. Reiver's 'rickshaw\n      wheels.",
                "There was nothing good about Mrs. Reiver, unless it was her dress.",
                "She was bad from her hair -- which started life on a Brittany's girl's\n      head -- to her boot-heels, which were two and three-eighth inches high.\n      She was not honestly mischievous like Mrs. Hauksbee; she was wicked in a\n      business-like way.",
                "There was never any scandal -- she had not generous impulses enough for\n      that. She was the exception which proved the rule that Anglo-Indian ladies\n      are in every way as nice as their sisters at Home.",
                "She spent her life in proving that rule.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee and she hated each other fervently. They heard far too much\n      to clash; but the things they said of each other were startling -- not\n      to say original. Mrs. Hauksbee was honest -- honest as her own front\n      teeth -- and, but for her love of mischief, would have been a woman's\n      woman. There was no honesty about Mrs. Reiver; nothing but selfishness.\n      And at the beginning of the season, poor little Pluffles fell a prey to\n      her. She laid herself out to that end, and who was Pluffles, to resist? He\n      went on trusting to his judgment, and he got judged.",
                "I have seen Hayes argue with a tough horse -- I have seen a\n      tonga-driver coerce a stubborn pony -- I have seen a riotous setter\n      broken to gun by a hard keeper -- but the breaking-in of Pluffles of\n      the \"Unmentionables\" was beyond all these. He learned to fetch and carry\n      like a dog, and to wait like one, too, for a word from Mrs. Reiver. He\n      learned to keep appointments which Mrs. Reiver had no intention of\n      keeping. He learned to take thankfully dances which Mrs. Reiver had no\n      intention of giving him. He learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on\n      the windward side of Elysium while Mrs. Reiver was making up her mind to\n      come for a ride. He learned to hunt for a 'rickshaw, in a light dress-suit\n      under a pelting rain, and to walk by the side of that 'rickshaw when he\n      had found it. He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and\n      ordered about like a cook. He learned all this and many other things\n      besides. And he paid for his schooling.",
                "Perhaps, in some hazy way, he fancied that it was fine and impressive,\n      that it gave him a status among men, and was altogether the thing to do.\n      It was nobody's business to warn Pluffles that he was unwise. The pace\n      that season was too good to inquire; and meddling with another man's folly\n      is always thankless work.",
                "Pluffles' Colonel should have ordered him back to his regiment when he\n      heard how things were going. But Pluffles had got himself engaged to a\n      girl in England the last time he went home; and if there was one thing\n      more than another which the Colonel detested, it was a married subaltern.\n      He chuckled when he heard of the education of Pluffles, and said it was\n      \"good training for the boy.\" But it was not good training in the least. It\n      led him into spending money beyond his means, which were good: above that,\n      the education spoilt an average boy and made it a tenth-rate man of an\n      objectionable kind. He wandered into a bad set, and his little bill at\n      Hamilton's was a thing to wonder at.",
                "Then Mrs. Hauksbee rose to the occasion. She played her game alone,\n      knowing what people would say of her; and she played it for the sake of a\n      girl she had never seen. Pluffles' fiancee was to come out, under the\n      chaperonage of an aunt, in October, to be married to Pluffles.",
                "At the beginning of August, Mrs. Hauksbee discovered that it was time to\n      interfere. A man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to do\n      next before he does it. In the same way, a woman of Mrs. Hauksbee's\n      experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain\n      circumstances -- notably when he is infatuated with one of Mrs.\n      Reiver's stamp. She said that, sooner or later, little Pluffles would\n      break off that engagement for nothing at all -- simply to gratify Mrs.\n      Reiver, who, in return, would keep him at her feet and in her service just\n      so long as she found it worth her while.",
                "She said she knew the signs of these things. If she did not, no one else\n      could.",
                "Then she went forth to capture Pluffles under the guns of the enemy; just\n      as Mrs. Cusack-Bremmil carried away Bremmil under Mrs. Hauksbee's eyes.",
                "This particular engagement lasted seven weeks -- we called it the Seven\n      Weeks' War -- and was fought out inch by inch on both sides. A detailed\n      account would fill a book, and would be incomplete then.",
                "Any one who knows about these things can fit in the details for himself.\n      It was a superb fight -- there will never be another like it as long as\n      Jakko stands -- and Pluffles was the prize of victory.",
                "People said shameful things about Mrs. Hauksbee. They did not know what\n      she was playing for. Mrs. Reiver fought, partly because Pluffles was\n      useful to her, but mainly because she hated Mrs. Hauksbee, and the matter\n      was a trial of strength between them. No one knows what Pluffles thought.\n      He had not many ideas at the best of times, and the few he possessed made\n      him conceited. Mrs. Hauksbee said: -- \"The boy must be caught; and the\n      only way of catching him is by treating him well.\"",
                "So she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as the\n      issue was doubtful. Little by little, Pluffles fell away from his old\n      allegiance and came over to the enemy, by whom he was made much of. He was\n      never sent on out-post duty after 'rickshaws any more, nor was he given\n      dances which never came off, nor were the drains on his purse continued.\n      Mrs. Hauksbee held him on the snaffle; and after his treatment at Mrs.\n      Reiver's hands, he appreciated the change.",
                "Mrs. Reiver had broken him of talking about himself, and made him talk\n      about her own merits. Mrs. Hauksbee acted otherwise, and won his\n      confidence, till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at Home, speaking\n      of it in a high and mighty way as a \"piece of boyish folly.\" This was when\n      he was taking tea with her one afternoon, and discoursing in what he\n      considered a gay and fascinating style.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee had seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and blossom,\n      and decay into fat Captains and tubby Majors.",
                "At a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that\n      lady's character. Some men say more. She began to talk to Pluffles after\n      the manner of a mother, and as if there had been three hundred years,\n      instead of fifteen, between them. She spoke with a sort of throaty quaver\n      in her voice which had a soothing effect, though what she said was\n      anything but soothing. She pointed out the exceeding folly, not to say\n      meanness, of Pluffles' conduct, and the smallness of his views. Then he\n      stammered something about \"trusting to his own judgment as a man of the\n      world;\" and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next. It would\n      have withered up Pluffles had it come from any other woman; but in the\n      soft cooing style in which Mrs. Hauksbee put it, it only made him feel\n      limp and repentant -- as if he had been in some superior kind of\n      church. Little by little, very softly and pleasantly, she began taking the\n      conceit out of Pluffles, as you take the ribs out of an umbrella before\n      re-covering it. She told him what she thought of him and his judgment and\n      his knowledge of the world; and how his performances had made him\n      ridiculous to other people; and how it was his intention to make love to\n      herself if she gave him the chance. Then she said that marriage would be\n      the making of him; and drew a pretty little picture -- all rose and\n      opal -- of the Mrs. Pluffles of the future going through life relying\n      on the \"judgment\" and \"knowledge of the world\" of a husband who had\n      nothing to reproach himself with. How she reconciled these two statements\n      she alone knew. But they did not strike Pluffles as conflicting.",
                "Hers was a perfect little homily -- much better than any clergyman\n      could have given -- and it ended with touching allusions to Pluffles'\n      Mamma and Papa, and the wisdom of taking his bride Home.",
                "Then she sent Pluffles out for a walk, to think over what she had said.\n      Pluffles left, blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very\n      straight. Mrs. Hauksbee laughed.",
                "What Pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only Mrs.\n      Reiver knew, and she kept her own counsel to her death. She would have\n      liked it spoiled as a compliment, I fancy.",
                "Pluffles enjoyed many talks with Mrs. Hauksbee during the next few days.\n      They were all to the same end, and they helped Pluffles in the path of\n      Virtue.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last.",
                "Therefore she discountenanced his going down to Bombay to get married.\n      \"Goodness only knows what might happen by the way!\" she said. \"Pluffles is\n      cursed with the curse of Reuben, and India is no fit place for him!\"",
                "In the end, the fiancee arrived with her aunt; and Pluffles, having\n      reduced his affairs to some sort of order -- here again Mrs. Hauksbee\n      helped him -- was married.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the \"I wills\" had been said,\n      and went her way.",
                "Pluffles took her advice about going Home. He left the Service, and is now\n      raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at Home. I\n      believe he does this very judiciously. He would have come to extreme grief\n      out here.",
                "For these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about\n      Mrs. Hauksbee, tell him the story of the Rescue of Pluffles."

Most Commissioners are mean; but\n      Barr-Saggott was an exception. He entertained royally; he horsed himself\n      well; he gave dances; he was a power in the land; and he behaved as such.",
                "Consider that everything I am writing of took place in an almost\n      pre-historic era in the history of British India. Some folk may remember\n      the years before lawn-tennis was born when we all played croquet. There\n      were seasons before that, if you will believe me, when even croquet had\n      not been invented, and archery -- which was revived in England in 1844 -- was\n      as great a pest as lawn-tennis is now. People talked learnedly about\n      \"holding\" and \"loosing,\" \"steles,\" \"reflexed bows,\" \"56-pound bows,\"\n       \"backed\" or \"self-yew bows,\" as we talk about \"rallies,\" \"volleys,\"\n       \"smashes,\" \"returns,\" and \"16-ounce rackets.\"",
                "Miss Beighton shot divinely over ladies' distance -- 60 yards, that is -- and\n      was acknowledged the best lady archer in Simla. Men called her \"Diana of\n      Tara-Devi.\"",
                "Barr-Saggott paid her great attention; and, as I have said, the heart of\n      her mother was uplifted in consequence. Kitty Beighton took matters more\n      calmly. It was pleasant to be singled out by a Commissioner with letters\n      after his name, and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings.\n      But there was no denying the fact that Barr-Saggott was phenomenally ugly;\n      and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more grotesque. He was\n      not christened \"The Langur\" -- which means gray ape -- for nothing.\n      It was pleasant, Kitty thought, to have him at her feet, but it was better\n      to escape from him and ride with the graceless Cubbon -- the man in a\n      Dragoon Regiment at Umballa -- the boy with a handsome face, and no\n      prospects. Kitty liked Cubbon more than a little. He never pretended for a\n      moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with her; for\n      he was an honest boy. So Kitty fled, now and again, from the stately\n      wooings of Barr-Saggott to the company of young Cubbon, and was scolded by\n      her Mamma in consequence. \"But, Mother,\" she said, \"Mr. Saggott is such -- such\n      a -- is so FEARFULLY ugly, you know!\"",
                "\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Beighton, piously, \"we cannot be other than an\n      all-ruling Providence has made us. Besides, you will take precedence of\n      your own Mother, you know! Think of that and be reasonable.\"",
                "Then Kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about\n      precedence, and Commissioners, and matrimony. Mr. Beighton rubbed the top\n      of his head; for he was an easy-going man.",
                "Late in the season, when he judged that the time was ripe, Barr-Saggott\n      developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers. He\n      arranged an archery tournament for ladies, with a most sumptuous\n      diamond-studded bracelet as prize.",
                "He drew up his terms skilfully, and every one saw that the bracelet was a\n      gift to Miss Beighton; the acceptance carrying with it the hand and the\n      heart of Commissioner Barr-Saggott. The terms were a St. Leonard's Round -- thirty-six\n      shots at sixty yards -- under the rules of the Simla Toxophilite\n      Society.",
                "All Simla was invited. There were beautifully arranged tea-tables under\n      the deodars at Annandale, where the Grand Stand is now; and, alone in its\n      glory, winking in the sun, sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet case.\n      Miss Beighton was anxious -- almost too anxious to compete. On the\n      appointed afternoon, all Simla rode down to Annandale to witness the\n      Judgment of Paris turned upside down.",
                "Kitty rode with young Cubbon, and it was easy to see that the boy was\n      troubled in his mind. He must be held innocent of everything that\n      followed. Kitty was pale and nervous, and looked long at the bracelet.\n      Barr-Saggott was gorgeously dressed, even more nervous than Kitty, and\n      more hideous than ever.",
                "Mrs. Beighton smiled condescendingly, as befitted the mother of a\n      potential Commissioneress, and the shooting began; all the world standing\n      in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other.",
                "Nothing is so tedious as an archery competition. They shot, and they shot,\n      and they kept on shooting, till the sun left the valley, and little\n      breezes got up in the deodars, and people waited for Miss Beighton to\n      shoot and win. Cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle round the\n      shooters, and Barr-Saggott at the other. Miss Beighton was last on the\n      list. The scoring had been weak, and the bracelet, PLUS Commissioner\n      Barr-Saggott, was hers to a certainty.",
                "The Commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands. She stepped\n      forward, looked at the bracelet, and her first arrow went true to a hair -- full\n      into the heart of the \"gold\" -- counting nine points.",
                "Young Cubbon on the left turned white, and his Devil prompted Barr-Saggott\n      to smile. Now horses used to shy when Barr-Saggott smiled.",
                "Kitty saw that smile. She looked to her left-front, gave an almost\n      imperceptible nod to Cubbon, and went on shooting.",
                "I wish I could describe the scene that followed. It was out of the\n      ordinary and most improper. Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense\n      deliberation, so that every one might see what she was doing. She was a\n      perfect shot; and her 46-pound bow suited her to a nicety. She pinned the\n      wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times. She\n      pinned the wooden top of the target once, and all the ladies looked at\n      each other. Then she began some fancy shooting at the white, which, if you\n      hit it, counts exactly one point. She put five arrows into the white. It\n      was wonderful archery; but, seeing that her business was to make \"golds\"\n       and win the bracelet, Barr-Saggott turned a delicate green like young\n      water-grass. Next, she shot over the target twice, then wide to the left\n      twice -- always with the same deliberation -- while a chilly hush\n      fell over the company, and Mrs. Beighton took out her handkerchief. Then\n      Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target, and split several arrows.\n      Then she made a red -- or seven points -- just to show what she\n      could do if she liked, and finished up her amazing performance with some\n      more fancy shooting at the target-supports. Here is her score as it was\n      picked off: --",
                "Gold. Red. Blue. Black. White. Total Hits.  Total Score Miss Beighton\n  1      1    0     0      5        7                  21",
                "Barr-Saggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into his\n      legs instead of the target's, and the deep stillness was broken by a\n      little snubby, mottled, half-grown girl saying in a shrill voice of\n      triumph: \"Then I'VE won!\"",
                "Mrs. Beighton did her best to bear up; but she wept in the presence of the\n      people. No training could help her through such a disappointment. Kitty\n      unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk, and went back to her place, while\n      Barr-Saggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping the bracelet\n      on the snubby girl's raw, red wrist. It was an awkward scene -- most\n      awkward. Every one tried to depart in a body and leave Kitty to the mercy\n      of her Mamma.",
                "But Cubbon took her away instead, and -- the rest isn't worth printing."

                "[When that sound drops about three tones, and changes to a thick, droning\n      ut, the man who hears it had better go away if he is alone.] The Native\n      Police Inspector ran in and told Michele that the town was in an uproar\n      and coming to wreck the Telegraph Office.",
                "The Babu put on his cap and quietly dropped out of the window; while the\n      Police Inspector, afraid, but obeying the old race-instinct which\n      recognizes a drop of White blood as far as it can be diluted, said: -- \"What\n      orders does the Sahib give?\"",
                "The \"Sahib\" decided Michele. Though horribly frightened, he felt that, for\n      the hour, he, the man with the Cochin Jew and the menial uncle in his\n      pedigree, was the only representative of English authority in the place.\n      Then he thought of Miss Vezzis and the fifty rupees, and took the\n      situation on himself. There were seven native policemen in Tibasu, and\n      four crazy smooth-bore muskets among them. All the men were gray with\n      fear, but not beyond leading. Michele dropped the key of the telegraph\n      instrument, and went out, at the head of his army, to meet the mob. As the\n      shouting crew came round a corner of the road, he dropped and fired; the\n      men behind him loosing instinctively at the same time.",
                "The whole crowd -- curs to the backbone -- yelled and ran; leaving\n      one man dead, and another dying in the road. Michele was sweating with\n      fear, but he kept his weakness under, and went down into the town, past\n      the house where the Sub-Judge had barricaded himself. The streets were\n      empty. Tibasu was more frightened than Michele, for the mob had been taken\n      at the right time.",
                "Michele returned to the Telegraph-Office, and sent a message to Chicacola\n      asking for help. Before an answer came, he received a deputation of the\n      elders of Tibasu, telling him that the Sub-Judge said his actions\n      generally were \"unconstitional,\" and trying to bully him. But the heart of\n      Michele D'Cruze was big and white in his breast, because of his love for\n      Miss Vezzis, the nurse-girl, and because he had tasted for the first time\n      Responsibility and Success. Those two make an intoxicating drink, and have\n      ruined more men than ever has Whiskey. Michele answered that the Sub-Judge\n      might say what he pleased, but, until the Assistant Collector came, the\n      Telegraph Signaller was the Government of India in Tibasu, and the elders\n      of the town would be held accountable for further rioting. Then they bowed\n      their heads and said: \"Show mercy!\" or words to that effect, and went back\n      in great fear; each accusing the other of having begun the rioting.",
                "Early in the dawn, after a night's patrol with his seven policemen,\n      Michele went down the road, musket in hand, to meet the Assistant\n      Collector, who had ridden in to quell Tibasu. But, in the presence of this\n      young Englishman, Michele felt himself slipping back more and more into\n      the native, and the tale of the Tibasu Riots ended, with the strain on the\n      teller, in an hysterical outburst of tears, bred by sorrow that he had\n      killed a man, shame that he could not feel as uplifted as he had felt\n      through the night, and childish anger that his tongue could not do justice\n      to his great deeds. It was the White drop in Michele's veins dying out,\n      though he did not know it.",
                "But the Englishman understood; and, after he had schooled those men of\n      Tibasu, and had conferred with the Sub-Judge till that excellent official\n      turned green, he found time to draught an official letter describing the\n      conduct of Michele. Which letter filtered through the Proper Channels, and\n      ended in the transfer of Michele up-country once more, on the Imperial\n      salary of sixty-six rupees a month.",
                "So he and Miss Vezzis were married with great state and ancientry; and now\n      there are several little D'Cruzes sprawling about the verandahs of the\n      Central Telegraph Office.",
                "But, if the whole revenue of the Department he serves were to be his\n      reward Michele could never, never repeat what he did at Tibasu for the\n      sake of Miss Vezzis the nurse-girl.",
                "Which proves that, when a man does good work out of all proportion to his\n      pay, in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the\n      virtue.",
                "The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke."

                "This began in a practical joke; but it has gone far enough now, and is\n      getting serious.",
                "Platte, the Subaltern, being poor, had a Waterbury watch and a plain\n      leather guard.",
                "The Colonel had a Waterbury watch also, and for guard, the lip-strap of a\n      curb-chain. Lip-straps make the best watch guards.",
                "They are strong and short. Between a lip-strap and an ordinary leather\n      guard there is no great difference; between one Waterbury watch and\n      another there is none at all. Every one in the station knew the Colonel's\n      lip-strap. He was not a horsey man, but he liked people to believe he had\n      been one once; and he wove fantastic stories of the hunting-bridle to\n      which this particular lip-strap had belonged. Otherwise he was painfully\n      religious.",
                "Platte and the Colonel were dressing at the Club -- both late for their\n      engagements, and both in a hurry. That was Kismet. The two watches were on\n      a shelf below the looking-glass -- guards hanging down. That was\n      carelessness. Platte changed first, snatched a watch, looked in the glass,\n      settled his tie, and ran. Forty seconds later, the Colonel did exactly the\n      same thing; each man taking the other's watch.",
                "You may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious.\n      They seem -- for purely religious purposes, of course -- to know\n      more about iniquity than the Unregenerate. Perhaps they were specially bad\n      before they became converted! At any rate, in the imputation of things\n      evil, and in putting the worst construction on things innocent, a certain\n      type of good people may be trusted to surpass all others. The Colonel and\n      his Wife were of that type. But the Colonel's Wife was the worst. She\n      manufactured the Station scandal, and -- TALKED TO HER AYAH! Nothing\n      more need be said. The Colonel's Wife broke up the Laplaces's home. The\n      Colonel's Wife stopped the Ferris-Haughtrey engagement. The Colonel's Wife\n      induced young Buxton to keep his wife down in the Plains through the first\n      year of the marriage. Whereby little Mrs.",
                "Buxton died, and the baby with her. These things will be remembered\n      against the Colonel's Wife so long as there is a regiment in the country.",
                "But to come back to the Colonel and Platte. They went their several ways\n      from the dressing-room. The Colonel dined with two Chaplains, while Platte\n      went to a bachelor-party, and whist to follow.",
                "Mark how things happen! If Platte's sais had put the new saddle-pad on the\n      mare, the butts of the terrets would not have worked through the worn\n      leather, and the old pad into the mare's withers, when she was coming home\n      at two o'clock in the morning. She would not have reared, bolted, fallen\n      into a ditch, upset the cart, and sent Platte flying over an aloe-hedge on\n      to Mrs. Larkyn's well-kept lawn; and this tale would never have been\n      written. But the mare did all these things, and while Platte was rolling\n      over and over on the turf, like a shot rabbit, the watch and guard flew\n      from his waistcoat -- as an Infantry Major's sword hops out of the\n      scabbard when they are firing a feu de joie -- and rolled and rolled in\n      the moonlight, till it stopped under a window.",
                "Platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad, put the cart straight, and\n      went home.",
                "Mark again how Kismet works! This would not happen once in a hundred\n      years. Towards the end of his dinner with the two Chaplains, the Colonel\n      let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some Mission\n      Reports. The bar of the watch-guard worked through the buttonhole, and the\n      watch -- Platte's watch -- slid quietly on to the carpet. Where the\n      bearer found it next morning and kept it.",
                "Then the Colonel went home to the wife of his bosom; but the driver of the\n      carriage was drunk and lost his way. So the Colonel returned at an\n      unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted. If the Colonel's Wife had\n      been an ordinary \"vessel of wrath appointed for destruction,\" she would\n      have known that when a man stays away on purpose, his excuse is always\n      sound and original. The very baldness of the Colonel's explanation proved\n      its truth.",
                "See once more the workings of Kismet! The Colonel's watch which came with\n      Platte hurriedly on to Mrs. Larkyn's lawn, chose to stop just under Mrs.\n      Larkyn's window, where she saw it early in the morning, recognized it, and\n      picked it up. She had heard the crash of Platte's cart at two o'clock that\n      morning, and his voice calling the mare names. She knew Platte and liked\n      him. That day she showed him the watch and heard his story. He put his\n      head on one side, winked and said: -- \"How disgusting! Shocking old\n      man! with his religious training, too! I should send the watch to the\n      Colonel's Wife and ask for explanations.\"",
                "Mrs. Larkyn thought for a minute of the Laplaces -- whom she had known\n      when Laplace and his wife believed in each other -- and answered: -- \"I\n      will send it. I think it will do her good. But remember, we must NEVER\n      tell her the truth.\"",
                "Platte guessed that his own watch was in the Colonel's possession, and\n      thought that the return of the lip-strapped Waterbury with a soothing note\n      from Mrs. Larkyn, would merely create a small trouble for a few minutes.\n      Mrs. Larkyn knew better. She knew that any poison dropped would find good\n      holding-ground in the heart of the Colonel's Wife.",
                "The packet, and a note containing a few remarks on the Colonel's\n      calling-hours, were sent over to the Colonel's Wife, who wept in her own\n      room and took counsel with herself.",
                "If there was one woman under Heaven whom the Colonel's Wife hated with\n      holy fervor, it was Mrs. Larkyn. Mrs. Larkyn was a frivolous lady, and\n      called the Colonel's Wife \"old cat.\" The Colonel's Wife said that somebody\n      in Revelations was remarkably like Mrs. Larkyn.",
                "She mentioned other Scripture people as well. From the Old Testament. [But\n      the Colonel's Wife was the only person who cared or dared to say anything\n      against Mrs. Larkyn. Every one else accepted her as an amusing, honest\n      little body.] Wherefore, to believe that her husband had been shedding\n      watches under that \"Thing's\" window at ungodly hours, coupled with the\n      fact of his late arrival on the previous night, was.....",
                "At this point she rose up and sought her husband. He denied everything\n      except the ownership of the watch. She besought him, for his Soul's sake,\n      to speak the truth. He denied afresh, with two bad words. Then a stony\n      silence held the Colonel's Wife, while a man could draw his breath five\n      times.",
                "The speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours. It was made up of\n      wifely and womanly jealousy; knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks; deep\n      mistrust born of the text that says even little babies' hearts are as bad\n      as they make them; rancorous hatred of Mrs. Larkyn, and the tenets of the\n      creed of the Colonel's Wife's upbringing.",
                "Over and above all, was the damning lip-strapped Waterbury, ticking away\n      in the palm of her shaking, withered hand. At that hour, I think, the\n      Colonel's Wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had\n      injected into old Laplace's mind, a little of poor Miss Haughtrey's\n      misery, and some of the canker that ate into Buxton's heart as he watched\n      his wife dying before his eyes. The Colonel stammered and tried to\n      explain. Then he remembered that his watch had disappeared; and the\n      mystery grew greater. The Colonel's Wife talked and prayed by turns till\n      she was tired, and went away to devise means for \"chastening the stubborn\n      heart of her husband.\" Which translated, means, in our slang,\n      \"tail-twisting.\"",
                "You see, being deeply impressed with the doctrine of Original Sin, she\n      could not believe in the face of appearances. She knew too much, and\n      jumped to the wildest conclusions.",
                "But it was good for her. It spoilt her life, as she had spoilt the life of\n      the Laplaces. She had lost her faith in the Colonel, and -- here the\n      creed suspicion came in -- he might, she argued, have erred many times,\n      before a merciful Providence, at the hands of so unworthy an instrument as\n      Mrs. Larkyn, had established his guilt.",
                "He was a bad, wicked, gray-haired profligate. This may sound too sudden a\n      revulsion for a long-wedded wife; but it is a venerable fact that, if a\n      man or woman makes a practice of, and takes a delight in, believing and\n      spreading evil of people indifferent to him or her, he or she will end in\n      believing evil of folk very near and dear. You may think, also, that the\n      mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise this\n      misunderstanding. It is another aged fact that, in life as well as racing,\n      all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cut-down fences. In\n      the same way, you sometimes see a woman who would have made a Joan of Arc\n      in another century and climate, threshing herself to pieces over all the\n      mean worry of housekeeping. But that is another story.",
                "Her belief only made the Colonel's Wife more wretched, because it insisted\n      so strongly on the villainy of men. Remembering what she had done, it was\n      pleasant to watch her unhappiness, and the penny-farthing attempts she\n      made to hide it from the Station. But the Station knew and laughed\n      heartlessly; for they had heard the story of the watch, with much dramatic\n      gesture, from Mrs. Larkyn's lips.",
                "Once or twice Platte said to Mrs. Larkyn, seeing that the Colonel had not\n      cleared himself: -- \"This thing has gone far enough. I move we tell the\n      Colonel's Wife how it happened.\" Mrs. Larkyn shut her lips and shook her\n      head, and vowed that the Colonel's Wife must bear her punishment as best\n      she could. Now Mrs. Larkyn was a frivolous woman, in whom none would have\n      suspected deep hate. So Platte took no action, and came to believe\n      gradually, from the Colonel's silence, that the Colonel must have \"run off\n      the line\" somewhere that night, and, therefore, preferred to stand\n      sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other people's compounds out\n      of calling hours. Platte forgot about the watch business after a while,\n      and moved down-country with his regiment. Mrs. Larkyn went home when her\n      husband's tour of Indian service expired. She never forgot.",
                "But Platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far.\n      The mistrust and the tragedy of it -- which we outsiders cannot see and\n      do not believe in -- are killing the Colonel's Wife, and are making the\n      Colonel wretched. If either of them read this story, they can depend upon\n      its being a fairly true account of the case, and can \"kiss and make\n      friends.\"",
                "Shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an Engineer being shelled\n      by his own Battery. Now this shows that poets should not write about what\n      they do not understand. Any one could have told him that Sappers and\n      Gunners are perfectly different branches of the Service. But, if you\n      correct the sentence, and substitute Gunner for Sapper, the moral comes\n      just the same."

He was a good husband according\n      to his lights, and his temper only failed him when he was being nursed.\n      Which was some seventeen days in each month. He was almost generous to his\n      wife about money matters, and that, for him, was a concession. Still Mrs.\n      Schreiderling was not happy. They married her when she was this side of\n      twenty and had given all her poor little heart to another man. I have\n      forgotten his name, but we will call him the Other Man.

But, in spite of all these things, she loved him very madly;\n      and there was some sort of an engagement between the two when\n      Schreiderling appeared and told Mrs. Gaurey that he wished to marry her\n      daughter. Then the other engagement was broken off -- washed away by\n      Mrs. Gaurey's tears, for that lady governed her house by weeping over\n      disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received in\n      her old age. The daughter did not take after her mother. She never cried.\n      Not even at the wedding.",
                "The Other Man bore his loss quietly, and was transferred to as bad a\n      station as he could find. Perhaps the climate consoled him. He suffered\n      from intermittent fever, and that may have distracted him from his other\n      trouble. He was weak about the heart also. Both ways. One of the valves\n      was affected, and the fever made it worse.",
                "This showed itself later on.",

                "She did not pine away like people in story books, but she seemed to pick\n      up every form of illness that went about a station, from simple fever\n      upwards. She was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times;\n      and the illness made her ugly. Schreiderling said so. He prided himself on\n      speaking his mind.",
                "When she ceased being pretty, he left her to her own devices, and went\n      back to the lairs of his bachelordom. She used to trot up and down Simla\n      Mall in a forlorn sort of way, with a gray Terai hat well on the back of\n      her head, and a shocking bad saddle under her.",
                "Schreiderling's generosity stopped at the horse. He said that any saddle\n      would do for a woman as nervous as Mrs. Schreiderling. She never was asked\n      to dance, because she did not dance well; and she was so dull and\n      uninteresting, that her box very seldom had any cards in it. Schreiderling\n      said that if he had known that she was going to be such a scare-crow after\n      her marriage, he would never have married her. He always prided himself on\n      speaking his mind, did Schreiderling!",

The fever and the heart-valves had nearly\n      killed him. She knew that, too, and she knew -- what I had no interest\n      in knowing -- when he was coming up. I suppose he wrote to tell her.\n      They had not seen each other since a month before the wedding. And here\n      comes the unpleasant part of the story.",
                "A late call kept me down at the Dovedell Hotel till dusk one evening. Mrs.\n      Schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the Mall all the afternoon in\n      the rain. Coming up along the Cart-road, a tonga passed me, and my pony,\n      tired with standing so long, set off at a canter. Just by the road down to\n      the Tonga Office Mrs. Schreiderling, dripping from head to foot, was\n      waiting for the tonga. I turned up-hill, as the tonga was no affair of\n      mine; and just then she began to shriek. I went back at once and saw,\n      under the Tonga Office lamps, Mrs. Schreiderling kneeling in the wet road\n      by the back seat of the newly-arrived tonga, screaming hideously.",
                "Then she fell face down in the dirt as I came up.",
                "Sitting in the back seat, very square and firm, with one hand on the\n      awning-stanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache, was the\n      Other Man -- dead. The sixty-mile up-hill jolt had been too much for\n      his valve, I suppose. The tonga-driver said: -- \"The Sahib died two\n      stages out of Solon. Therefore, I tied him with a rope, lest he should\n      fall out by the way, and so came to Simla. Will the Sahib give me\n      bukshish?

                "The Other Man sat with a grin on his face, as if he enjoyed the joke of\n      his arrival; and Mrs. Schreiderling, in the mud, began to groan. There was\n      no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily. The first\n      thing was to take Mrs. Schreiderling home, and the second was to prevent\n      her name from being mixed up with the affair. The tonga-driver received\n      five rupees to find a bazar 'rickshaw for Mrs. Schreiderling. He was to\n      tell the tonga Babu afterwards of the Other Man, and the Babu was to make\n      such arrangements as seemed best.",
                "Mrs. Schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain, and for\n      three-quarters of an hour we two waited for the 'rickshaw. The Other Man\n      was left exactly as he had arrived. Mrs. Schreiderling would do everything\n      but cry, which might have helped her. She tried to scream as soon as her\n      senses came back, and then she began praying for the Other Man's soul. Had\n      she not been as honest as the day, she would have prayed for her own soul\n      too. I waited to hear her do this, but she did not. Then I tried to get\n      some of the mud off her habit. Lastly, the 'rickshaw came, and I got her\n      away -- partly by force. It was a terrible business from beginning to\n      end; but most of all when the 'rickshaw had to squeeze between the wall\n      and the tonga, and she saw by the lamp-light that thin, yellow hand\n      grasping the awning-stanchion.",
                "She was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at Viceregal\n      Lodge -- \"Peterhoff\" it was then -- and the doctor found that she\n      had fallen from her horse, that I had picked her up at the back of Jakko,\n      and really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which I had\n      secured medical aid. She did not die -- men of Schreiderling's stamp\n      marry women who don't die easily. They live and grow ugly.",
                "She never told of her one meeting, since her marriage, with the Other Man;\n      and, when the chill and cough following the exposure of that evening,\n      allowed her abroad, she never by word or sign alluded to having met me by\n      the Tonga Office. Perhaps she never knew.",
                "She used to trot up and down the Mall, on that shocking bad saddle,\n      looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every minute.\n      Two years afterward, she went Home, and died -- at Bournemouth, I\n      think.",
                "Schreiderling, when he grew maudlin at Mess, used to talk about \"my poor\n      dear wife.\" He always set great store on speaking his mind, did\n      Schreiderling!"

                "There are yearly appointments, and two-yearly appointments, and\n      five-yearly appointments at Simla, and there are, or used to be, permanent\n      appointments, whereon you stayed up for the term of your natural life and\n      secured red cheeks and a nice income. Of course, you could descend in the\n      cold weather; for Simla is rather dull then.",
                "Tarrion came from goodness knows where -- all away and away in some\n      forsaken part of Central India, where they call Pachmari a \"Sanitarium,\"\n       and drive behind trotting bullocks, I believe. He belonged to a regiment;\n      but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his regiment and live\n      in Simla forever and ever. He had no preference for anything in\n      particular, beyond a good horse and a nice partner. He thought he could do\n      everything well; which is a beautiful belief when you hold it with all\n      your heart. He was clever in many ways, and good to look at, and always\n      made people round him comfortable -- even in Central India.",
                "So he went up to Simla, and, because he was clever and amusing, he\n      gravitated naturally to Mrs. Hauksbee, who could forgive everything but\n      stupidity. Once he did her great service by changing the date on an\n      invitation-card for a big dance which Mrs. Hauksbee wished to attend, but\n      couldn't because she had quarrelled with the A.-D.-C., who took care,\n      being a mean man, to invite her to a small dance on the 6th instead of the\n      big Ball of the 26th. It was a very clever piece of forgery; and when Mrs.\n      Hauksbee showed the A.-D.-C. her invitation-card, and chaffed him mildly\n      for not better managing his vendettas, he really thought he had made a\n      mistake; and -- which was wise -- realized that it was no use to\n      fight with Mrs. Hauksbee. She was grateful to Tarrion and asked what she\n      could do for him. He said simply: \"I'm a Freelance up here on leave, and\n      on the lookout for what I can loot. I haven't a square inch of interest in\n      all Simla. My name isn't known to any man with an appointment in his gift,\n      and I want an appointment -- a good, sound, pukka one. I believe you\n      can do anything you turn yourself to do. Will you help me?\" Mrs. Hauksbee\n      thought for a minute, and passed the last of her riding-whip through her\n      lips, as was her custom when thinking.",
                "Then her eyes sparkled, and she said: -- \"I will;\" and she shook hands\n      on it. Tarrion, having perfect confidence in this great woman, took no\n      further thought of the business at all. Except to wonder what sort of an\n      appointment he would win.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the Heads of Departments\n      and Members of Council she knew, and the more she thought the more she\n      laughed, because her heart was in the game and it amused her. Then she\n      took a Civil List and ran over a few of the appointments. There are some\n      beautiful appointments in the Civil List. Eventually, she decided that,\n      though Tarrion was too good for the Political Department, she had better\n      begin by trying to get him in there. What were her own plans to this end,\n      does not matter in the least, for Luck or Fate played into her hands, and\n      she had nothing to do but to watch the course of events and take the\n      credit of them.",
                "All Viceroys, when they first come out, pass through the \"Diplomatic\n      Secrecy\" craze. It wears off in time; but they all catch it in the\n      beginning, because they are new to the country.",
                "The particular Viceroy who was suffering from the complaint just then -- this\n      was a long time ago, before Lord Dufferin ever came from Canada, or Lord\n      Ripon from the bosom of the English Church -- had it very badly; and\n      the result was that men who were new to keeping official secrets went\n      about looking unhappy; and the Viceroy plumed himself on the way in which\n      he had instilled notions of reticence into his Staff.",
                "Now, the Supreme Government have a careless custom of committing what they\n      do to printed papers. These papers deal with all sorts of things -- from\n      the payment of Rs. 200 to a \"secret service\" native, up to rebukes\n      administered to Vakils and Motamids of Native States, and rather brusque\n      letters to Native Princes, telling them to put their houses in order, to\n      refrain from kidnapping women, or filling offenders with pounded red\n      pepper, and eccentricities of that kind. Of course, these things could\n      never be made public, because Native Princes never err officially, and\n      their States are, officially, as well administered as Our territories.\n      Also, the private allowances to various queer people are not exactly\n      matters to put into newspapers, though they give quaint reading sometimes.",
                "When the Supreme Government is at Simla, these papers are prepared there,\n      and go round to the people who ought to see them in office-boxes or by\n      post. The principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy quite as important as\n      the practice, and he held that a benevolent despotism like Ours should\n      never allow even little things, such as appointments of subordinate\n      clerks, to leak out till the proper time. He was always remarkable for his\n      principles.",
                "There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time. It\n      had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand.",
                "It was not put into an official envelope, but a large, square, pale-pink\n      one; the matter being in MS. on soft crinkly paper. It was addressed to\n      \"The Head Clerk, etc., etc.\" Now, between \"The Head Clerk, etc., etc.,\"\n       and \"Mrs. Hauksbee\" and a flourish, is no very great difference if the\n      address be written in a very bad hand, as this was. The chaprassi who took\n      the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis. He merely\n      forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered, and so asked\n      the first Englishman he met, who happened to be a man riding down to\n      Annandale in a great hurry. The Englishman hardly looked, said: \"Hauksbee\n      Sahib ki Mem,\" and went on. So did the chaprassi, because that letter was\n      the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over. There was no book to\n      sign; he thrust the letter into Mrs. Hauksbee's bearer's hands and went\n      off to smoke with a friend.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee was expecting some cut-out pattern things in flimsy paper\n      from a friend. As soon as she got the big square packet, therefore, she\n      said, \"Oh, the DEAR creature!\" and tore it open with a paper-knife, and\n      all the MS. enclosures tumbled out on the floor.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee began reading. I have said the batch was rather important.\n      That is quite enough for you to know. It referred to some correspondence,\n      two measures, a peremptory order to a native chief and two dozen other\n      things. Mrs. Hauksbee gasped as she read, for the first glimpse of the\n      naked machinery of the Great Indian Government, stripped of its casings,\n      and lacquer, and paint, and guard-rails, impresses even the most stupid\n      man. And Mrs. Hauksbee was a clever woman. She was a little afraid at\n      first, and felt as if she had laid hold of a lightning-flash by the tail,\n      and did not quite know what to do with it. There were remarks and initials\n      at the side of the papers; and some of the remarks were rather more severe\n      than the papers. The initials belonged to men who are all dead or gone\n      now; but they were great in their day.",
                "Mrs. Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read. Then the value of\n      her trove struck her, and she cast about for the best method of using it.\n      Then Tarrion dropped in, and they read through all the papers together,\n      and Tarrion, not knowing how she had come by them, vowed that Mrs.\n      Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth.",
                "Which I believe was true, or nearly so.",
                "\"The honest course is always the best,\" said Tarrion after an hour and a\n      half of study and conversation. \"All things considered, the Intelligence\n      Branch is about my form. Either that or the Foreign Office. I go to lay\n      siege to the High Gods in their Temples.\"",
                "He did not seek a little man, or a little big man, or a weak Head of a\n      strong Department, but he called on the biggest and strongest man that the\n      Government owned, and explained that he wanted an appointment at Simla on\n      a good salary. The compound insolence of this amused the Strong Man, and,\n      as he had nothing to do for the moment, he listened to the proposals of\n      the audacious Tarrion.",
                "\"You have, I presume, some special qualifications, besides the gift of\n      self-assertion, for the claims you put forwards?\" said the Strong Man.\n      \"That, Sir,\" said Tarrion, \"is for you to judge.\" Then he began, for he\n      had a good memory, quoting a few of the more important notes in the papers -- slowly\n      and one by one as a man drops chlorodyne into a glass. When he had reached\n      the peremptory order -- and it WAS a peremptory order -- the Strong\n      Man was troubled.",
                "Tarrion wound up: -- \"And I fancy that special knowledge of this kind\n      is at least as valuable for, let us say, a berth in the Foreign Office, as\n      the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officer's wife.\" That hit\n      the Strong Man hard, for the last appointment to the Foreign Office had\n      been by black favor, and he knew it. \"I'll see what I can do for you,\"\n       said the Strong Man. \"Many thanks,\" said Tarrion. Then he left, and the\n      Strong Man departed to see how the appointment was to be blocked..........",
                "Followed a pause of eleven days; with thunders and lightnings and much\n      telegraphing. The appointment was not a very important one, carrying only\n      between Rs. 500 and Rs. 700 a month; but, as the Viceroy said, it was the\n      principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained, and it was more\n      than likely that a boy so well supplied with special information would be\n      worth translating. So they translated him. They must have suspected him,\n      though he protested that his information was due to singular talents of\n      his own. Now, much of this story, including the after-history of the\n      missing envelope, you must fill in for yourself, because there are reasons\n      why it cannot be written. If you do not know about things Up Above, you\n      won't understand how to fill it in, and you will say it is impossible.",
                "What the Viceroy said when Tarrion was introduced to him was: -- \"So,\n      this is the boy who 'rusked' the Government of India, is it? Recollect,\n      Sir, that is not done TWICE.\" So he must have known something.",
                "What Tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted was: -- \"If Mrs.\n      Hauksbee were twenty years younger, and I her husband, I should be Viceroy\n      of India in twenty years.\"",
                "What Mrs. Hauksbee said, when Tarrion thanked her, almost with tears in\n      his eyes, was first: -- \"I told you so!\" and next, to herself: -- \"What\n      fools men are!\""

                "Every man is entitled to his own religious opinions; but no man -- least\n      of all a junior -- has a right to thrust these down other men's\n      throats. The Government sends out weird Civilians now and again; but\n      McGoggin was the queerest exported for a long time. He was clever -- brilliantly\n      clever -- but his cleverness worked the wrong way. Instead of keeping\n      to the study of the vernaculars, he had read some books written by a man\n      called Comte, I think, and a man called Spencer, and a Professor Clifford.\n      [You will find these books in the Library.] They deal with people's\n      insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs. There was no\n      order against his reading them; but his Mamma should have smacked him.",
                "They fermented in his head, and he came out to India with a rarefied\n      religion over and above his work. It was not much of a creed. It only\n      proved that men had no souls, and there was no God and no hereafter, and\n      that you must worry along somehow for the good of Humanity.",
                "One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than\n      giving an order was obeying it. At least, that was what McGoggin said; but\n      I suspect he had misread his primers.",
                "I do not say a word against this creed. It was made up in Town, where\n      there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and building -- all shut in\n      by the fog. Naturally, a man grows to think that there is no one higher\n      than himself, and that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything.\n      But in this country, where you really see humanity -- raw, brown, naked\n      humanity -- with nothing between it and the blazing sky, and only the\n      used-up, over-handled earth underfoot, the notion somehow dies away, and\n      most folk come back to simpler theories. Life, in India, is not long\n      enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the head\n      of affairs.",
                "For this reason. The Deputy is above the Assistant, the Commissioner above\n      the Deputy, the Lieutenant-Governor above the Commissioner, and the\n      Viceroy above all four, under the orders of the Secretary of State, who is\n      responsible to the Empress. If the Empress be not responsible to her Maker -- if\n      there is no Maker for her to be responsible to -- the entire system of\n      Our administration must be wrong. Which is manifestly impossible. At Home\n      men are to be excused. They are stalled up a good deal and get\n      intellectually \"beany.\" When you take a gross, \"beany\" horse to exercise,\n      he slavers and slobbers over the bit till you can't see the horns.",
                "But the bit is there just the same. Men do not get \"beany\" in India. The\n      climate and the work are against playing bricks with words.",
                "If McGoggin had kept his creed, with the capital letters and the endings\n      in \"isms,\" to himself, no one would have cared; but his grandfathers on\n      both sides had been Wesleyan preachers, and the preaching strain came out\n      in his mind. He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no souls\n      too, and to help him to eliminate his Creator. As a good many men told\n      him, HE undoubtedly had no soul, because he was so young, but it did not\n      follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped; and, whether there was\n      another world or not, a man still wanted to read his papers in this. \"But\n      that is not the point -- that is not the point!\" Aurelian used to say.\n      Then men threw sofa-cushions at him and told him to go to any particular\n      place he might believe in. They christened him the \"Blastoderm\" -- he\n      said he came from a family of that name somewhere, in the pre-historic\n      ages -- and, by insult and laughter, strove to choke him dumb, for he\n      was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club; besides being an offence to the\n      older men. His Deputy Commissioner, who was working on the Frontier when\n      Aurelian was rolling on a bed-quilt, told him that, for a clever boy,\n      Aurelian was a very big idiot. And, you know, if he had gone on with his\n      work, he would have been caught up to the Secretariat in a few years. He\n      was just the type that goes there -- all head, no physique and a\n      hundred theories. Not a soul was interested in McGoggin's soul. He might\n      have had two, or none, or somebody's else's. His business was to obey\n      orders and keep abreast of his files instead of devastating the Club with\n      \"isms.\"",
                "He worked brilliantly; but he could not accept any order without trying to\n      better it. That was the fault of his creed. It made men too responsible\n      and left too much to their honor. You can sometimes ride an old horse in a\n      halter; but never a colt.",
                "McGoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his year.\n      He may have fancied that thirty-page judgments on fifty-rupee cases -- both\n      sides perjured to the gullet -- advanced the cause of Humanity. At any\n      rate, he worked too much, and worried and fretted over the rebukes he\n      received, and lectured away on his ridiculous creed out of office, till\n      the Doctor had to warn him that he was overdoing it. No man can toil\n      eighteen annas in the rupee in June without suffering. But McGoggin was\n      still intellectually \"beany\" and proud of himself and his powers, and he\n      would take no hint. He worked nine hours a day steadily.",
                "\"Very well,\" said the doctor, \"you'll break down because you are\n      over-engined for your beam.\" McGoggin was a little chap.",
                "One day, the collapse came -- as dramatically as if it had been meant\n      to embellish a Tract.",
                "It was just before the Rains. We were sitting in the verandah in the dead,\n      hot, close air, gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds would let\n      down and bring the cool. Very, very far away, there was a faint whisper,\n      which was the roar of the Rains breaking over the river. One of the men\n      heard it, got out of his chair, listened, and said, naturally enough: -- \"Thank\n      God!\"",
                "Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and said: -- \"Why? I assure you\n      it's only the result of perfectly natural causes -- atmospheric\n      phenomena of the simplest kind. Why you should, therefore, return thanks\n      to a Being who never did exist -- who is only a figment -- \"",
                "\"Blastoderm,\" grunted the man in the next chair, \"dry up, and throw me\n      over the Pioneer. We know all about your figments.\" The Blastoderm reached\n      out to the table, took up one paper, and jumped as if something had stung\n      him. Then he handed the paper over.",
                "\"As I was saying,\" he went on slowly and with an effort -- \"due to\n      perfectly natural causes -- perfectly natural causes. I mean -- \"",

                "The dust got up in little whorls, while the treetops rocked and the kites\n      whistled. But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains.",
                "We were all staring at the Blastoderm, who had risen from his chair and\n      was fighting with his speech. Then he said, still more slowly: --",
                "\"Perfectly conceivable -- dictionary -- red oak -- amenable -- cause -- retaining -- shuttlecock -- alone.\"",
                "\"Blastoderm's drunk,\" said one man. But the Blastoderm was not drunk. He\n      looked at us in a dazed sort of way, and began motioning with his hands in\n      the half light as the clouds closed overhead.",
                "Then -- with a scream: --",
                "\"What is it? -- Can't -- reserve -- attainable -- market -- obscure -- \"",
                "But his speech seemed to freeze in him, and -- just as the lightning\n      shot two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain\n      fell in quivering sheets -- the Blastoderm was struck dumb. He stood\n      pawing and champing like a hard-held horse, and his eyes were full of\n      terror.",
                "The Doctor came over in three minutes, and heard the story. \"It's\n      aphasia,\" he said. \"Take him to his room. I KNEW the smash would come.\" We\n      carried the Blastoderm across, in the pouring rain, to his quarters, and\n      the Doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep.",
                "Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all the\n      arrears of \"Punjab Head\" falling in a lump; and that only once before -- in\n      the case of a sepoy -- had he met with so complete a case. I myself\n      have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man, but this sudden dumbness was\n      uncanny -- though, as the Blastoderm himself might have said, due to\n      \"perfectly natural causes.\"",
                "\"He'll have to take leave after this,\" said the Doctor. \"He won't be fit\n      for work for another three months. No; it isn't insanity or anything like\n      it. It's only complete loss of control over the speech and memory. I fancy\n      it will keep the Blastoderm quiet, though.\"",

                "The stroke cowed the Blastoderm. He could not understand it. He went into\n      the Hills in fear and trembling, wondering whether he would be permitted\n      to reach the end of any sentence he began.",

                "This tale is a justifiable exception.",
                "Once in every five years, as you know, we indent for a new Viceroy; and\n      each Viceroy imports, with the rest of his baggage, a Private Secretary,\n      who may or may not be the real Viceroy, just as Fate ordains. Fate looks\n      after the Indian Empire because it is so big and so helpless.",
                "There was a Viceroy once, who brought out with him a turbulent Private\n      Secretary -- a hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for\n      work. This Secretary was called Wonder -- John Fennil Wonder. The\n      Viceroy possessed no name -- nothing but a string of counties and\n      two-thirds of the alphabet after them. He said, in confidence, that he was\n      the electro-plated figurehead of a golden administration, and he watched\n      in a dreamy, amused way Wonder's attempts to draw matters which were\n      entirely outside his province into his own hands. \"When we are all\n      cherubims together,\" said His Excellency once, \"my dear, good friend\n      Wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out Gabriel's tail-feathers\n      or stealing Peter's keys. THEN I shall report him.\"",
                "But, though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonder's officiousness, other\n      people said unpleasant things. Maybe the Members of Council began it; but,\n      finally, all Simla agreed that there was \"too much Wonder, and too little\n      Viceroy,\" in that regime. Wonder was always quoting \"His Excellency.\" It\n      was \"His Excellency this,\" \"His Excellency that,\" \"In the opinion of His\n      Excellency,\" and so on. The Viceroy smiled; but he did not heed.",
                "He said that, so long as his old men squabbled with his \"dear, good\n      Wonder,\" they might be induced to leave the \"Immemorial East\" in peace.",
                "\"No wise man has a policy,\" said the Viceroy. \"A Policy is the blackmail\n      levied on the Fool by the Unforeseen. I am not the former, and I do not\n      believe in the latter.\"",
                "I do not quite see what this means, unless it refers to an Insurance\n      Policy. Perhaps it was the Viceroy's way of saying: -- \"Lie low.\"",
                "That season, came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a single\n      idea. These are the men who make things move; but they are not nice to\n      talk to. This man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for fifteen years\n      on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, studying cholera. He held that\n      cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy\n      atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake. The germ\n      could be rendered sterile, he said, by \"Mellish's Own Invincible\n      Fumigatory\" -- a heavy violet-black powder -- \"the result of fifteen\n      years' scientific investigation, Sir!\"",
                "Inventors seem very much alike as a caste. They talk loudly, especially\n      about \"conspiracies of monopolists;\" they beat upon the table with their\n      fists; and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their persons.",
                "Mellish said that there was a Medical \"Ring\" at Simla, headed by the\n      Surgeon-General, who was in league, apparently, with all the Hospital\n      Assistants in the Empire. I forget exactly how he proved it, but it had\n      something to do with \"skulking up to the Hills;\" and what Mellish wanted\n      was the independent evidence of the Viceroy -- \"Steward of our Most\n      Gracious Majesty the Queen, Sir.\" So Mellish went up to Simla, with\n      eighty-four pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk, to speak to the Viceroy and\n      to show him the merits of the invention.",
                "But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him, unless you chance\n      to be as important as Mellishe of Madras. He was a six-thousand-rupee man,\n      so great that his daughters never \"married.\" They \"contracted alliances.\"\n       He himself was not paid. He \"received emoluments,\" and his journeys about\n      the country were \"tours of observation.\" His business was to stir up the\n      people in Madras with a long pole -- as you stir up stench in a pond -- and\n      the people had to come up out of their comfortable old ways and gasp: -- \"This\n      is Enlightenment and progress. Isn't it fine!\" Then they gave Mellishe\n      statues and jasmine garlands, in the hope of getting rid of him.",
                "Mellishe came up to Simla \"to confer with the Viceroy.\" That was one of\n      his perquisites. The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that he was\n      \"one of those middle-class deities who seem necessary to the spiritual\n      comfort of this Paradise of the Middle-classes,\" and that, in all\n      probability, he had \"suggested, designed, founded, and endowed all the\n      public institutions in Madras.\" Which proves that His Excellency, though\n      dreamy, had experience of the ways of six-thousand-rupee men.",
                "Mellishe's name was E. Mellishe and Mellish's was E. S. Mellish, and they\n      were both staying at the same hotel, and the Fate that looks after the\n      Indian Empire ordained that Wonder should blunder and drop the final \"e;\"\n       that the Chaprassi should help him, and that the note which ran: \"Dear Mr.\n      Mellish. -- Can you set aside your other engagements and lunch with us\n      at two tomorrow? His Excellency has an hour at your disposal then,\" should\n      be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory. He nearly wept with pride and\n      delight, and at the appointed hour cantered off to Peterhoff, a big\n      paper-bag full of the Fumigatory in his coat-tail pockets. He had his\n      chance, and he meant to make the most of it. Mellishe of Madras had been\n      so portentously solemn about his \"conference,\" that Wonder had arranged\n      for a private tiffin -- no A.-D.-C.'s, no Wonder, no one but the\n      Viceroy, who said plaintively that he feared being left alone with\n      unmuzzled autocrats like the great Mellishe of Madras.",
                "But his guest did not bore the Viceroy. On the contrary, he amused him.\n      Mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his Fumigatory, and talked\n      at random until tiffin was over and His Excellency asked him to smoke. The\n      Viceroy was pleased with Mellish because he did not talk \"shop.\"",
                "As soon as the cheroots were lit, Mellish spoke like a man; beginning with\n      his cholera-theory, reviewing his fifteen years' \"scientific labors,\" the\n      machinations of the \"Simla Ring,\" and the excellence of his Fumigatory,\n      while the Viceroy watched him between half-shut eyes and thought:\n      \"Evidently, this is the wrong tiger; but it is an original animal.\"\n       Mellish's hair was standing on end with excitement, and he stammered. He\n      began groping in his coat-tails and, before the Viceroy knew what was\n      about to happen, he had tipped a bagful of his powder into the big silver\n      ash-tray.",
                "\"J-j-judge for yourself, Sir,\" said Mellish. \"Y' Excellency shall judge\n      for yourself! Absolutely infallible, on my honor.\"",
                "He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder, which began to\n      smoke like a volcano, and send up fat, greasy wreaths of copper-colored\n      smoke. In five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and\n      sickening stench -- a reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your\n      windpipe and shut it. The powder then hissed and fizzed, and sent out blue\n      and green sparks, and the smoke rose till you could neither see, nor\n      breathe, nor gasp. Mellish, however, was used to it.",
                "\"Nitrate of strontia,\" he shouted; \"baryta, bone-meal, etcetera! Thousand\n      cubic feet smoke per cubic inch. Not a germ could live -- not a germ,\n      Y' Excellency!\"",
                "But His Excellency had fled, and was coughing at the foot of the stairs,\n      while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive. Red Lancers came in, and the Head\n      Chaprassi, who speaks English, came in, and mace-bearers came in, and\n      ladies ran downstairs screaming \"fire;\" for the smoke was drifting through\n      the house and oozing out of the windows, and bellying along the verandahs,\n      and wreathing and writhing across the gardens. No one could enter the room\n      where Mellish was lecturing on his Fumigatory, till that unspeakable\n      powder had burned itself out.",
                "Then an Aide-de-Camp, who desired the V. C., rushed through the rolling\n      clouds and hauled Mellish into the hall. The Viceroy was prostrate with\n      laughter, and could only waggle his hands feebly at Mellish, who was\n      shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him.",
                "\"Glorious! Glorious!\" sobbed his Excellency. \"Not a germ, as you justly\n      observe, could exist! I can swear it. A magnificent success!\"",
                "Then he laughed till the tears came, and Wonder, who had caught the real\n      Mellishe snorting on the Mall, entered and was deeply shocked at the\n      scene. But the Viceroy was delighted, because he saw that Wonder would\n      presently depart. Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased, for he\n      felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical \"Ring.\".........",
                "Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the trouble,\n      and the account of \"my dear, good Wonder's friend with the powder\" went\n      the round of Simla, and flippant folk made Wonder unhappy by their\n      remarks.",
                "But His Excellency told the tale once too often -- for Wonder. As he\n      meant to do. It was at a Seepee Picnic. Wonder was sitting just behind the\n      Viceroy.",
                "\"And I really thought for a moment,\" wound up His Excellency, \"that my\n      dear, good Wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne!\"",
                "Every one laughed; but there was a delicate subtinkle in the Viceroy's\n      tone which Wonder understood. He found that his health was giving way; and\n      the Viceroy allowed him to go, and presented him with a flaming\n      \"character\" for use at Home among big people.",
                "\"My fault entirely,\" said His Excellency, in after seasons, with a\n      twinkling in his eye. \"My inconsistency must always have been distasteful\n      to such a masterly man.\""

Think for a minute, and\n      you will see that it must be so; unless, of course, you believe in\n      \"affinities.\" In which case you had better not read this tale. How can a\n      man who has never married; who cannot be trusted to pick up at sight a\n      moderately sound horse; whose head is hot and upset with visions of\n      domestic felicity, go about the choosing of a wife?

E. at the end of it. All his superiors spoke well of him, because\n      he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times. There are\n      today only eleven men in India who possess this secret; and they have all,\n      with one exception, attained great honor and enormous incomes.",
                "This good young man was quiet and self-contained -- too old for his\n      years by far. Which always carries its own punishment. Had a Subaltern, or\n      a Tea-Planter's Assistant, or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for\n      tomorrow, done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared. But when\n      Peythroppe -- the estimable, virtuous, economical, quiet, hard-working,\n      young Peythroppe -- fell, there was a flutter through five Departments.",
                "The manner of his fall was in this way. He met a Miss Castries -- d'Castries\n      it was originally, but the family dropped the d' for administrative\n      reasons -- and he fell in love with her even more energetically than he\n      worked. Understand clearly that there was not a breath of a word to be\n      said against Miss Castries -- not a shadow of a breath. She was good\n      and very lovely -- possessed what innocent people at home call a\n      \"Spanish\" complexion, with thick blue-black hair growing low down on her\n      forehead, into a \"widow's peak,\" and big violet eyes under eyebrows as\n      black and as straight as the borders of a Gazette Extraordinary when a big\n      man dies. But -- but -- but -- . Well, she was a VERY sweet girl\n      and very pious, but for many reasons she was \"impossible.\" Quite so. All\n      good Mammas know what \"impossible\" means. It was obviously absurd that\n      Peythroppe should marry her. The little opal-tinted onyx at the base of\n      her finger-nails said this as plainly as print. Further, marriage with\n      Miss Castries meant marriage with several other Castries -- Honorary\n      Lieutenant Castries, her Papa, Mrs. Eulalie Castries, her Mamma, and all\n      the ramifications of the Castries family, on incomes ranging from Rs. 175\n      to Rs. 470 a month, and THEIR wives and connections again.",
                "It would have been cheaper for Peythroppe to have assaulted a Commissioner\n      with a dog-whip, or to have burned the records of a Deputy Commissioner's\n      Office, than to have contracted an alliance with the Castries. It would\n      have weighted his after-career less -- even under a Government which\n      never forgets and NEVER forgives.",
                "Everybody saw this but Peythroppe. He was going to marry Miss Castries, he\n      was -- being of age and drawing a good income -- and woe betide the\n      house that would not afterwards receive Mrs. Virginie Saulez Peythroppe\n      with the deference due to her husband's rank.",
                "That was Peythroppe's ultimatum, and any remonstrance drove him frantic.",
                "These sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men. There was a case once -- but\n      I will tell you of that later on. You cannot account for the mania, except\n      under a theory directly contradicting the one about the Place wherein\n      marriages are made. Peythroppe was burningly anxious to put a millstone\n      round his neck at the outset of his career and argument had not the least\n      effect on him. He was going to marry Miss Castries, and the business was\n      his own business.",
                "He would thank you to keep your advice to yourself. With a man in this\n      condition, mere words only fix him in his purpose. Of course he cannot see\n      that marriage out here does not concern the individual but the Government\n      he serves.",
                "Do you remember Mrs. Hauksbee -- the most wonderful woman in India? She\n      saved Pluffles from Mrs. Reiver, won Tarrion his appointment in the\n      Foreign Office, and was defeated in open field by Mrs. Cusack-Bremmil. She\n      heard of the lamentable condition of Peythroppe, and her brain struck out\n      the plan that saved him. She had the wisdom of the Serpent, the logical\n      coherence of the Man, the fearlessness of the Child, and the triple\n      intuition of the Woman. Never -- no, never -- as long as a tonga\n      buckets down the Solon dip, or the couples go a-riding at the back of\n      Summer Hill, will there be such a genius as Mrs. Hauksbee.

                "Three weeks later, Peythroppe dined with the Three Men, and the Gazette of\n      India came in. Peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been gazetted\n      a month's leave. Don't ask me how this was managed. I believe firmly that\n      if Mrs. Hauksbee gave the order, the whole Great Indian Administration\n      would stand on its head.",
                "The Three Men had also a month's leave each. Peythroppe put the Gazette\n      down and said bad words. Then there came from the compound the soft\n      \"pad-pad\" of camels -- \"thieves' camels,\" the bikaneer breed that don't\n      bubble and howl when they sit down and get up.",

                "At the end of the month, Peythroppe was gazetted twenty days' extension of\n      leave; but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of Castries. The\n      marriage-day had been fixed, but the bridegroom never came; and the\n      D'Silvas, Pereiras, and Ducketts lifted their voices and mocked Honorary\n      Lieutenant Castries as one who had been basely imposed upon. Mrs. Hauksbee\n      went to the wedding, and was much astonished when Peythroppe did not\n      appear. After seven weeks, Peythroppe and the Three Men returned from\n      Rajputana. Peythroppe was in hard, tough condition, rather white, and more\n      self-contained than ever.",
                "One of the Three Men had a cut on his nose, cause by the kick of a gun.\n      Twelve-bores kick rather curiously.",
                "Then came Honorary Lieutenant Castries, seeking for the blood of his\n      perfidious son-in-law to be. He said things -- vulgar and \"impossible\"\n       things which showed the raw rough \"ranker\" below the \"Honorary,\" and I\n      fancy Peythroppe's eyes were opened. Anyhow, he held his peace till the\n      end; when he spoke briefly. Honorary Lieutenant Castries asked for a \"peg\"\n       before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise.",
                "Miss Castries was a very good girl. She said that she would have no breach\n      of promise suits. She said that, if she was not a lady, she was refined\n      enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to themselves; and, as\n      she ruled her parents, nothing happened. Later on, she married a most\n      respectable and gentlemanly person. He travelled for an enterprising firm\n      in Calcutta, and was all that a good husband should be.",
                "So Peythroppe came to his right mind again, and did much good work, and\n      was honored by all who knew him. One of these days he will marry; but he\n      will marry a sweet pink-and-white maiden, on the Government House List,\n      with a little money and some influential connections, as every wise man\n      should. And he will never, all his life, tell her what happened during the\n      seven weeks of his shooting-tour in Rajputana.",
                "But just think how much trouble and expense -- for camel hire is not\n      cheap, and those Bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humans -- might\n      have been saved by a properly conducted Matrimonial Department, under the\n      control of the Director General of Education, but corresponding direct\n      with the Viceroy."

                "IF there was one thing on which Golightly prided himself more than\n      another, it was looking like \"an Officer and a gentleman.\" He said it was\n      for the honor of the Service that he attired himself so elaborately; but\n      those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity. There was\n      no harm about Golightly -- not an ounce.",
                "He recognized a horse when he saw one, and could do more than fill a\n      cantle. He played a very fair game at billiards, and was a sound man at\n      the whist-table. Everyone liked him; and nobody ever dreamed of seeing him\n      handcuffed on a station platform as a deserter. But this sad thing\n      happened.",
                "He was going down from Dalhousie, at the end of his leave -- riding\n      down. He had cut his leave as fine as he dared, and wanted to come down in\n      a hurry.",
                "It was fairly warm at Dalhousie, and knowing what to expect below, he\n      descended in a new khaki suit -- tight fitting -- of a delicate\n      olive-green; a peacock-blue tie, white collar, and a snowy white solah\n      helmet. He prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post. He\n      did look neat, and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before\n      he started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change\n      with him. He left all his notes at the hotel. His servants had gone down\n      the road before him, to be ready in waiting at Pathankote with a change of\n      gear. That was what he called travelling in \"light marching-order.\" He was\n      proud of his faculty of organization -- what we call bundobust.",
                "Twenty-two miles out of Dalhousie it began to rain -- not a mere\n      hill-shower, but a good, tepid monsoonish downpour. Golightly bustled on,\n      wishing that he had brought an umbrella. The dust on the roads turned into\n      mud, and the pony mired a good deal. So did Golightly's khaki gaiters. But\n      he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant the coolth was.",
                "His next pony was rather a brute at starting, and Golightly's hands being\n      slippery with the rain, contrived to get rid of Golightly at a corner. He\n      chased the animal, caught it, and went ahead briskly.",
                "The spill had not improved his clothes or his temper, and he had lost one\n      spur. He kept the other one employed. By the time that stage was ended,\n      the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted, and, in spite of the rain,\n      Golightly was sweating freely. At the end of another miserable half-hour,\n      Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy pulp. The\n      rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solah-topee into an\n      evil-smelling dough, and it had closed on his head like a half-opened\n      mushroom. Also the green lining was beginning to run.",
                "Golightly did not say anything worth recording here. He tore off and\n      squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on. The\n      back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to his\n      ears, but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly together,\n      so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped.",
                "Presently, the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew which\n      ran over Golightly in several directions -- down his back and bosom for\n      choice. The khaki color ran too -- it was really shockingly bad dye -- and\n      sections of Golightly were brown, and patches were violet, and contours\n      were ochre, and streaks were ruddy red, and blotches were nearly white,\n      according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye. When he took out his\n      handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the hat-lining and the\n      purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck from the tie became\n      thoroughly mixed, the effect was amazing.",
                "Near Dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up\n      slightly. It fixed the colors, too. Three miles from Pathankote the last\n      pony fell dead lame, and Golightly was forced to walk. He pushed on into\n      Pathankote to find his servants. He did not know then that his khitmatgar\n      had stopped by the roadside to get drunk, and would come on the next day\n      saying that he had sprained his ankle. When he got into Pathankote, he\n      couldn't find his servants, his boots were stiff and ropy with mud, and\n      there were large quantities of dirt about his body. The blue tie had run\n      as much as the khaki. So he took it off with the collar and threw it away.\n      Then he said something about servants generally and tried to get a peg. He\n      paid eight annas for the drink, and this revealed to him that he had only\n      six annas more in his pocket -- or in the world as he stood at that\n      hour.",
                "He went to the Station-Master to negotiate for a first-class ticket to\n      Khasa, where he was stationed. The booking-clerk said something to the\n      Station-Master, the Station-Master said something to the Telegraph Clerk,\n      and the three looked at him with curiosity. They asked him to wait for\n      half-an-hour, while they telegraphed to Umritsar for authority. So he\n      waited, and four constables came and grouped themselves picturesquely\n      round him. Just as he was preparing to ask them to go away, the\n      Station-Master said that he would give the Sahib a ticket to Umritsar, if\n      the Sahib would kindly come inside the booking-office. Golightly stepped\n      inside, and the next thing he knew was that a constable was attached to\n      each of his legs and arms, while the Station-Master was trying to cram a\n      mailbag over his head.",
                "There was a very fair scuffle all round the booking-office, and Golightly\n      received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against a table. But the\n      constables were too much for him, and they and the Station-Master\n      handcuffed him securely. As soon as the mail-bag was slipped, he began\n      expressing his opinions, and the head-constable said: -- \"Without doubt\n      this is the soldier-Englishman we required. Listen to the abuse!\" Then\n      Golightly asked the Station-Master what the this and the that the\n      proceedings meant. The Station-Master told him he was \"Private John Binkle\n      of the --  -- Regiment, 5 ft. 9 in., fair hair, gray eyes, and a\n      dissipated appearance, no marks on the body,\" who had deserted a fortnight\n      ago. Golightly began explaining at great length; and the more he explained\n      the less the Station-Master believed him. He said that no Lieutenant could\n      look such a ruffian as did Golightly, and that his instructions were to\n      send his capture under proper escort to Umritsar. Golightly was feeling\n      very damp and uncomfortable, and the language he used was not fit for\n      publication, even in an expurgated form. The four constables saw him safe\n      to Umritsar in an \"intermediate\" compartment, and he spent the four-hour\n      journey in abusing them as fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars\n      allowed.",
                "At Umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a Corporal\n      and two men of the --  -- Regiment. Golightly drew himself up and\n      tried to carry off matters jauntily. He did not feel too jaunty in\n      handcuffs, with four constables behind him, and the blood from the cut on\n      his forehead stiffening on his left cheek. The Corporal was not jocular\n      either. Golightly got as far as -- \"This is a very absurd mistake, my\n      men,\" when the Corporal told him to \"stow his lip\" and come along.\n      Golightly did not want to come along. He desired to stop and explain. He\n      explained very well indeed, until the Corporal cut in with: -- \"YOU a\n      orficer! It's the like o' YOU as brings disgrace on the likes of US.\n      Bloom-in' fine orficer you are! I know your regiment. The Rogue's March is\n      the quickstep where you come from. You're a black shame to the Service.\"",
                "Golightly kept his temper, and began explaining all over again from the\n      beginning. Then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshment-room\n      and told not to make a qualified fool of himself.",
                "The men were going to run him up to Fort Govindghar. And \"running up\" is a\n      performance almost as undignified as the Frog March.",
                "Golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake\n      and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had given\n      him. He really laid himself out to express what was in his mind. When he\n      had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry, one of the men said: -- \"I've\n      'eard a few beggars in the click blind, stiff and crack on a bit; but I've\n      never 'eard any one to touch this 'ere 'orficer.'\" They were not angry\n      with him. They rather admired him. They had some beer at the\n      refreshment-room, and offered Golightly some too, because he had \"swore\n      won'erful.\" They asked him to tell them all about the adventures of\n      Private John Binkle while he was loose on the countryside; and that made\n      Golightly wilder than ever. If he had kept his wits about him he would\n      have kept quiet until an officer came; but he attempted to run.",
                "Now the butt of a Martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal,\n      and rotten, rain-soaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at\n      your collar.",
                "Golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy, with his shirt\n      ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back.",
                "He yielded to his luck, and at that point the down-train from Lahore came\n      in carrying one of Golightly's Majors.",
                "This is the Major's evidence in full: --",
                "\"There was the sound of a scuffle in the second-class refreshment-room, so\n      I went in and saw the most villainous loafer that I ever set eyes on. His\n      boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beer-stains. He wore a\n      muddy-white dunghill sort of thing on his head, and it hung down in slips\n      on his shoulders, which were a good deal scratched. He was half in and\n      half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be, and he was\n      begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it. As he had rucked\n      the shirt all over his head, I couldn't at first see who he was, but I\n      fancied that he was a man in the first stage of D. T. from the way he\n      swore while he wrestled with his rags. When he turned round, and I had\n      made allowance for a lump as big as a pork-pie over one eye, and some\n      green war-paint on the face, and some violet stripes round the neck, I saw\n      that it was Golightly. He was very glad to see me,\" said the Major, \"and\n      he hoped I would not tell the Mess about it. I didn't, but you can if you\n      like, now that Golightly has gone Home.\"",
                "Golightly spent the greater part of that summer in trying to get the\n      Corporal and the two soldiers tried by Court-Martial for arresting an\n      \"officer and a gentleman.\" They were, of course, very sorry for their\n      error. But the tale leaked into the regimental canteen, and thence ran\n      about the Province."

                "The house of Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied, with four\n      carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You may recognize it by\n      five red hand-prints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash\n      between the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass, the bunnia, and a man who says he\n      gets his living by seal-cutting, live in the lower story with a troop of\n      wives, servants, friends, and retainers. The two upper rooms used to be\n      occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was\n      stolen from an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by a soldier. Today,\n      only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally,\n      except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go to Peshawar in the cold\n      weather to visit his son, who sells curiosities near the Edwardes' Gate,\n      and then he slept under a real mud roof.",
                "Suddhoo is a great friend of mine, because his cousin had a son who\n      secured, thanks to my recommendation, the post of head-messenger to a big\n      firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God will make me a\n      Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I daresay his prophecy will come\n      true. He is very, very old, with white hair and no teeth worth showing,\n      and he has outlived his wits -- outlived nearly everything except his\n      fondness for his son at Peshawar. Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris, Ladies\n      of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable\n      profession; but Azizun has since married a medical student from the\n      North-West and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near\n      Bareilly. Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He is very\n      rich. The man who is supposed to get his living by seal-cutting pretends\n      to be very poor.",
                "This lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants\n      in the house of Suddhoo. Then there is Me, of course; but I am only the\n      chorus that comes in at the end to explain things. So I do not count.",
                "Suddhoo was not clever. The man who pretended to cut seals was the\n      cleverest of them all -- Bhagwan Dass only knew how to lie -- except\n      Janoo. She was also beautiful, but that was her own affair.",
                "Suddhoo's son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy, and old Suddhoo was\n      troubled. The seal-cutter man heard of Suddhoo's anxiety and made capital\n      out of it. He was abreast of the times. He got a friend in Peshawar to\n      telegraph daily accounts of the son's health.",
                "And here the story begins.",
                "Suddhoo's cousin's son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo wanted to see\n      me; that he was too old and feeble to come personally, and that I should\n      be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to\n      him. I went; but I think, seeing how well-off Suddhoo was then, that he\n      might have sent something better than an ekka, which jolted fearfully, to\n      haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor to the City on a muggy April\n      evening. The ekka did not run quickly.",
                "It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singh's\n      Tomb near the main gate of the Fort. Here was Suddhoo and he said that, by\n      reason of my condescension, it was absolutely certain that I should become\n      a Lieutenant-Governor while my hair was yet black. Then we talked about\n      the weather and the state of my health, and the wheat crops, for fifteen\n      minutes, in the Huzuri Bagh, under the stars.",
                "Suddhoo came to the point at last. He said that Janoo had told him that\n      there was an order of the Sirkar against magic, because it was feared that\n      magic might one day kill the Empress of India. I didn't know anything\n      about the state of the law; but I fancied that something interesting was\n      going to happen. I said that so far from magic being discouraged by the\n      Government it was highly commended.",
                "The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves. (If the\n      Financial Statement isn't magic, I don't know what is.) Then, to encourage\n      him further, I said that, if there was any jadoo afoot, I had not the\n      least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction, and to seeing\n      that it was clean jadoo -- white magic, as distinguished from the\n      unclean jadoo which kills folk. It took a long time before Suddhoo\n      admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for. Then he told\n      me, in jerks and quavers, that the man who said he cut seals was a\n      sorcerer of the cleanest kind; that every day he gave Suddhoo news of the\n      sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly, and that\n      this news was always corroborated by the letters. Further, that he had\n      told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son, which could be\n      removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment. I began to see how\n      the land lay, and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo in\n      the Western line, and would go to his house to see that everything was\n      done decently and in order. We set off together; and on the way Suddhoo\n      told me he had paid the seal-cutter between one hundred and two hundred\n      rupees already; and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more.\n      Which was cheap, he said, considering the greatness of his son's danger;\n      but I do not think he meant it.",
                "The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived. I\n      could hear awful noises from behind the seal-cutter's shop-front, as if\n      some one were groaning his soul out. Suddhoo shook all over, and while we\n      groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun. Janoo and Azizun\n      met us at the stair-head, and told us that the jadoo-work was coming off\n      in their rooms, because there was more space there. Janoo is a lady of a\n      freethinking turn of mind. She whispered that the jadoo was an invention\n      to get money out of Suddhoo, and that the seal-cutter would go to a hot\n      place when he died. Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age. He\n      kept walking up and down the room in the half light, repeating his son's\n      name over and over again, and asking Azizun if the seal-cutter ought not\n      to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord.",
                "Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved\n      bow-windows. The boards were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny\n      lamp. There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still.",
                "Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on the staircase.\n      That was the seal-cutter. He stopped outside the door as the terrier\n      barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain, and he told Suddhoo to blow out\n      the lamp. This left the place in jet darkness, except for the red glow\n      from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun. The seal-cutter came\n      in, and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan. Azizun\n      caught her breath, and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a shudder.\n      There was a clink of something metallic, and then shot up a pale\n      blue-green flame near the ground. The light was just enough to show\n      Azizun, pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between\n      her knees; Janoo, with her hands clasped, leaning forward as she sat on\n      the bed; Suddhoo, face down, quivering, and the seal-cutter.",
                "I hope I may never see another man like that seal-cutter. He was stripped\n      to the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round\n      his forehead, a salmon-colored loin-cloth round his middle, and a steel\n      bangle on each ankle. This was not awe-inspiring. It was the face of the\n      man that turned me cold. It was blue-gray in the first place. In the\n      second, the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the whites of\n      them; and, in the third, the face was the face of a demon -- a ghoul -- anything\n      you please except of the sleek, oily old ruffian who sat in the day-time\n      over his turning-lathe downstairs. He was lying on his stomach, with his\n      arms turned and crossed behind him, as if he had been thrown down\n      pinioned. His head and neck were the only parts of him off the floor. They\n      were nearly at right angles to the body, like the head of a cobra at\n      spring. It was ghastly. In the centre of the room, on the bare earth\n      floor, stood a big, deep, brass basin, with a pale blue-green light\n      floating in the centre like a night-light. Round that basin the man on the\n      floor wriggled himself three times. How he did it I do not know. I could\n      see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again; but I could\n      not see any other motion.",
                "The head seemed the only thing alive about him, except that slow curl and\n      uncurl of the laboring back-muscles. Janoo from the bed was breathing\n      seventy to the minute; Azizun held her hands before her eyes; and old\n      Suddhoo, fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard, was\n      crying to himself. The horror of it was that the creeping, crawly thing\n      made no sound -- only crawled! And, remember, this lasted for ten\n      minutes, while the terrier whined, and Azizun shuddered, and Janoo gasped,\n      and Suddhoo cried.",
                "I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart thump like a\n      thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal-cutter betrayed himself by his\n      most impressive trick and made me calm again. After he had finished that\n      unspeakable triple crawl, he stretched his head away from the floor as\n      high as he could, and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils. Now, I\n      knew how fire-spouting is done -- I can do it myself -- so I felt at\n      ease. The business was a fraud. If he had only kept to that crawl without\n      trying to raise the effect, goodness knows what I might not have thought.\n      Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head dropped, chin\n      down, on the floor with a thud; the whole body lying then like a corpse\n      with its arms trussed.",
                "There was a pause of five full minutes after this, and the blue-green\n      flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while Azizun\n      turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put\n      out an arm mechanically to Janoo's huqa, and she slid it across the floor\n      with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall, were a couple of\n      flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince of\n      Wales. They looked down on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to\n      heighten the grotesqueness of it all.",
                "Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body turned over and\n      rolled away from the basin to the side of the room, where it lay stomach\n      up. There was a faint \"plop\" from the basin -- exactly like the noise a\n      fish makes when it takes a fly -- and the green light in the centre\n      revived.",
                "I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water, the dried,\n      shrivelled, black head of a native baby -- open eyes, open mouth and\n      shaved scalp. It was worse, being so very sudden, than the crawling\n      exhibition. We had no time to say anything before it began to speak.",
                "Read Poe's account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man,\n      and you will realize less than one-half of the horror of that head's\n      voice.",
                "There was an interval of a second or two between each word, and a sort of\n      \"ring, ring, ring,\" in the note of the voice, like the timbre of a bell.\n      It pealed slowly, as if talking to itself, for several minutes before I\n      got rid of my cold sweat. Then the blessed solution struck me. I looked at\n      the body lying near the doorway, and saw, just where the hollow of the\n      throat joins on the shoulders, a muscle that had nothing to do with any\n      man's regular breathing, twitching away steadily. The whole thing was a\n      careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that one read about\n      sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of\n      ventriloquism as one could wish to hear. All this time the head was\n      \"lip-lip-lapping\" against the side of the basin, and speaking. It told\n      Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of his son's illness and of the state\n      of the illness up to the evening of that very night. I always shall\n      respect the seal-cutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the\n      Peshawar telegrams. It went on to say that skilled doctors were night and\n      day watching over the man's life; and that he would eventually recover if\n      the fee to the potent sorcerer, whose servant was the head in the basin,\n      were doubled.",
                "Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in. To ask for twice\n      your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used when he rose\n      from the dead, is absurd. Janoo, who is really a woman of masculine\n      intellect, saw this as quickly as I did. I heard her say \"Asli nahin!\n      Fareib!\" scornfully under her breath; and just as she said so, the light\n      in the basin died out, the head stopped talking, and we heard the room\n      door creak on its hinges. Then Janoo struck a match, lit the lamp, and we\n      saw that head, basin, and seal-cutter were gone. Suddhoo was wringing his\n      hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen, that, if his chances\n      of eternal salvation depended on it, he could not raise another two\n      hundred rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner; while Janoo\n      sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities of the\n      whole thing being a bunao, or \"make-up.\"",
                "I explained as much as I knew of the seal-cutter's way of jadoo; but her\n      argument was much more simple: -- \"The magic that is always demanding\n      gifts is no true magic,\" said she. \"My mother told me that the only potent\n      love-spells are those which are told you for love. This seal-cutter man is\n      a liar and a devil. I dare not tell, do anything, or get anything done,\n      because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a\n      heavy anklet. I must get my food from his shop. The seal-cutter is the\n      friend of Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food. A fool's jadoo has\n      been going on for ten days, and has cost Suddhoo many rupees each night.\n      The seal-cutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before. He never\n      showed us anything like this till tonight. Azizun is a fool, and will be a\n      purdah nashin soon. Suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits. See now! I\n      had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees while he lived, and many more\n      after his death; and behold, he is spending everything on that offspring\n      of a devil and a she-ass, the seal-cutter!\"",
                "Here I said: -- \"But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business?\n      Of course I can speak to the seal-cutter, and he shall refund. The whole\n      thing is child's talk -- shame -- and senseless.\"",
                "\"Suddhoo IS an old child,\" said Janoo. \"He has lived on the roofs these\n      seventy years and is as senseless as a milch-goat. He brought you here to\n      assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar, whose salt\n      he ate many years ago. He worships the dust off the feet of the\n      seal-cutter, and that cow-devourer has forbidden him to go and see his\n      son. What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightning-post? I have to\n      watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below.\"",
                "Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation; while\n      Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner, and Azizun was\n      trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth....... ...",
                "Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself open to the\n      charge of aiding and abetting the seal-cutter in obtaining money under\n      false pretences, which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal\n      Code. I am helpless in the matter for these reasons, I cannot inform the\n      Police. What witnesses would support my statements? Janoo refuses flatly,\n      Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly -- lost in this big\n      India of ours. I cannot again take the law into my own hands, and speak to\n      the seal-cutter; for certain am I that, not only would Suddhoo disbelieve\n      me, but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is bound hand\n      and foot by her debt to the bunnia. Suddhoo is an old dotard; and whenever\n      we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather patronizes the\n      Black Art than otherwise. His son is well now; but Suddhoo is completely\n      under the influence of the seal-cutter, by whose advice he regulates the\n      affairs of his life. Janoo watches daily the money that she hoped to\n      wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the seal-cutter, and becomes daily more\n      furious and sullen.",
                "She will never tell, because she dare not; but, unless something happens\n      to prevent her, I am afraid that the seal-cutter will die of cholera -- the\n      white arsenic kind -- about the middle of May. And thus I shall have to\n      be privy to a murder in the House of Suddhoo."

                "Shakespeare says something about worms, or it may be giants or beetles,\n      turning if you tread on them too severely. The safest plan is never to\n      tread on a worm -- not even on the last new subaltern from Home, with\n      his buttons hardly out of their tissue paper, and the red of sappy English\n      beef in his cheeks. This is the story of the worm that turned. For the\n      sake of brevity, we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, \"The Worm,\"\n       although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy, without a hair on his\n      face, and with a waist like a girl's when he came out to the Second\n      \"Shikarris\" and was made unhappy in several ways. The \"Shikarris\" are a\n      high-caste regiment, and you must be able to do things well -- play a\n      banjo or ride more than a little, or sing, or act -- to get on with\n      them.",
                "The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony, and knock chips out of\n      gate-posts with his trap. Even that became monotonous after a time. He\n      objected to whist, cut the cloth at billiards, sang out of tune, kept very\n      much to himself, and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home. Four of these\n      five things were vices which the \"Shikarris\" objected to and set\n      themselves to eradicate. Every one knows how subalterns are, by brother\n      subalterns, softened and not permitted to be ferocious. It is good and\n      wholesome, and does no one any harm, unless tempers are lost; and then\n      there is trouble. There was a man once -- but that is another story.",
                "The \"Shikarris\" shikarred The Worm very much, and he bore everything\n      without winking. He was so good and so anxious to learn, and flushed so\n      pink, that his education was cut short, and he was left to his own devices\n      by every one except the Senior Subaltern, who continued to make life a\n      burden to The Worm. The Senior Subaltern meant no harm; but his chaff was\n      coarse, and he didn't quite understand where to stop. He had been waiting\n      too long for his company; and that always sours a man. Also he was in\n      love, which made him worse.",
                "One day, after he had borrowed The Worm's trap for a lady who never\n      existed, had used it himself all the afternoon, had sent a note to The\n      Worm purporting to come from the lady, and was telling the Mess all about\n      it, The Worm rose in his place and said, in his quiet, ladylike voice:\n      \"That was a very pretty sell; but I'll lay you a month's pay to a month's\n      pay when you get your step, that I work a sell on you that you'll remember\n      for the rest of your days, and the Regiment after you when you're dead or\n      broke.\" The Worm wasn't angry in the least, and the rest of the Mess\n      shouted. Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm from the boots\n      upwards, and down again, and said, \"Done, Baby.\" The Worm took the rest of\n      the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken, and retired into a book\n      with a sweet smile.",
                "Two months passed, and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm, who\n      began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on. I have said\n      that the Senior Subaltern was in love. The curious thing is that a girl\n      was in love with the Senior Subaltern. Though the Colonel said awful\n      things, and the Majors snorted, and married Captains looked unutterable\n      wisdom, and the juniors scoffed, those two were engaged.",
                "The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his\n      acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm. The girl\n      was a pretty girl, and had money of her own. She does not come into this\n      story at all.",
                "One night, at the beginning of the hot weather, all the Mess, except The\n      Worm, who had gone to his own room to write Home letters, were sitting on\n      the platform outside the Mess House. The Band had finished playing, but no\n      one wanted to go in. And the Captains' wives were there also. The folly of\n      a man in love is unlimited.",
                "The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl he\n      was engaged to, and the ladies were purring approval, while the men\n      yawned, when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark, and a tired, faint\n      voice lifted itself:",
                "\"Where's my husband?\"",
                "I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the \"Shikarris;\"\n       but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had been shot.\n      Three of them were married men. Perhaps they were afraid that their wives\n      had come from Home unbeknownst. The fourth said that he had acted on the\n      impulse of the moment. He explained this afterwards.",
                "Then the voice cried: -- \"Oh, Lionel!\" Lionel was the Senior\n      Subaltern's name. A woman came into the little circle of light by the\n      candles on the peg-tables, stretching out her hands to the dark where the\n      Senior Subaltern was, and sobbing. We rose to our feet, feeling that\n      things were going to happen and ready to believe the worst. In this bad,\n      small world of ours, one knows so little of the life of the next man -- which,\n      after all, is entirely his own concern -- that one is not surprised\n      when a crash comes. Anything might turn up any day for any one. Perhaps\n      the Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth. Men are crippled that\n      way occasionally. We didn't know; we wanted to hear; and the Captains'\n      wives were as anxious as we. If he HAD been trapped, he was to be excused;\n      for the woman from nowhere, in the dusty shoes, and gray travelling dress,\n      was very lovely, with black hair and great eyes full of tears. She was\n      tall, with a fine figure, and her voice had a running sob in it pitiful to\n      hear. As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up, she threw her arms round\n      his neck, and called him \"my darling,\" and said she could not bear waiting\n      alone in England, and his letters were so short and cold, and she was his\n      to the end of the world, and would he forgive her. This did not sound\n      quite like a lady's way of speaking. It was too demonstrative.",
                "Things seemed black indeed, and the Captains' wives peered under their\n      eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern, and the Colonel's face set like the Day\n      of Judgment framed in gray bristles, and no one spoke for a while.",
                "Next the Colonel said, very shortly: -- \"Well, Sir?\" and the woman\n      sobbed afresh. The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round\n      his neck, but he gasped out: -- \"It's a d --  -- d lie! I never\n      had a wife in my life!\" \"Don't swear,\" said the Colonel. \"Come into the\n      Mess. We must sift this clear somehow,\" and he sighed to himself, for he\n      believed in his \"Shikarris,\" did the Colonel.",
                "We trooped into the ante-room, under the full lights, and there we saw how\n      beautiful the woman was. She stood up in the middle of us all, sometimes\n      choking with crying, then hard and proud, and then holding out her arms to\n      the Senior Subaltern. It was like the fourth act of a tragedy. She told us\n      how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he was Home on leave\n      eighteen months before; and she seemed to know all that we knew, and more\n      too, of his people and his past life. He was white and ashy gray, trying\n      now and again to break into the torrent of her words; and we, noting how\n      lovely she was and what a criminal he looked, esteemed him a beast of the\n      worst kind. We felt sorry for him, though.",
                "I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife.\n      Nor will he. It was so sudden, rushing out of the dark, unannounced, into\n      our dull lives. The Captains' wives stood back; but their eyes were\n      alight, and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced\n      the Senior Subaltern. The Colonel seemed five years older. One Major was\n      shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath it.\n      Another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he were\n      witnessing a play. Full in the open space in the centre, by the\n      whist-tables, the Senior Subaltern's terrier was hunting for fleas. I\n      remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand. I\n      remember the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern's face. It was rather\n      like seeing a man hanged; but much more interesting. Finally, the woman\n      wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F. M. in\n      tattoo on his left shoulder. We all knew that, and to our innocent minds\n      it seemed to clinch the matter. But one of the Bachelor Majors said very\n      politely: -- \"I presume that your marriage certificate would be more to\n      the purpose?\"",
                "That roused the woman. She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern\n      for a cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest. Then she\n      wept, and then she pulled a paper from her breast, saying imperially: -- \"Take\n      that! And let my husband -- my lawfully wedded husband -- read it\n      aloud -- if he dare!\"",
                "There was a hush, and the men looked into each other's eyes as the Senior\n      Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and took the paper. We\n      were wondering as we stared, whether there was anything against any one of\n      us that might turn up later on. The Senior Subaltern's throat was dry;\n      but, as he ran his eye over the paper, he broke out into a hoarse cackle\n      of relief, and said to the woman: -- \"You young blackguard!\"",
                "But the woman had fled through a door, and on the paper was written: -- \"This\n      is to certify that I, The Worm, have paid in full my debts to the Senior\n      Subaltern, and, further, that the Senior Subaltern is my debtor, by\n      agreement on the 23d of February, as by the Mess attested, to the extent\n      of one month's Captain's pay, in the lawful currency of the India Empire.\"",
                "Then a deputation set off for The Worm's quarters and found him, betwixt\n      and between, unlacing his stays, with the hat, wig, serge dress, etc., on\n      the bed. He came over as he was, and the \"Shikarris\" shouted till the\n      Gunners' Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun. I\n      think we were all, except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern, a little\n      disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing. But that is human\n      nature. There could be no two words about The Worm's acting. It leaned as\n      near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can. When most of\n      the Subalterns sat upon him with sofa-cushions to find out why he had not\n      said that acting was his strong point, he answered very quietly: -- \"I\n      don't think you ever asked me. I used to act at Home with my sisters.\" But\n      no acting with girls could account for The Worm's display that night.\n      Personally, I think it was in bad taste.",
                "Besides being dangerous. There is no sort of use in playing with fire,\n      even for fun.",
                "The \"Shikarris\" made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club; and,\n      when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt, which he did at once, The Worm\n      sank the money in scenery and dresses. He was a good Worm; and the\n      \"Shikarris\" are proud of him. The only drawback is that he has been\n      christened \"Mrs. Senior Subaltern;\" and as there are now two Mrs. Senior\n      Subalterns in the Station, this is sometimes confusing to strangers.",
                "Later on, I will tell you of a case something like, this, but with all the\n      jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble."

He began his career by riding jump-races in Melbourne, where\n      a few Stewards want lynching, and was one of the jockeys who came through\n      the awful butchery -- perhaps you will recollect it -- of the\n      Maribyrnong Plate. The walls were colonial ramparts -- logs of jarrak\n      spiked into masonry -- with wings as strong as Church buttresses. Once\n      in his stride, a horse had to jump or fall. He couldn't run out. In the\n      Maribyrnong Plate, twelve horses were jammed at the second wall. Red Hat,\n      leading, fell this side, and threw out The Glen, and the ruck came up\n      behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling, screaming,\n      kicking shambles. Four jockeys were taken out dead; three were very badly\n      hurt, and Brunt was among the three. He told the story of the Maribyrnong\n      Plate sometimes; and when he described how Whalley on Red Hat, said, as\n      the mare fell under him: -- \"God ha' mercy, I'm done for!\" and how,\n      next instant, Sithee There and White Otter had crushed the life out of\n      poor Whalley, and the dust hid a small hell of men and horses, no one\n      marvelled that Brunt had dropped jump-races and Australia together. Regula\n      Baddun's owner knew that story by heart. Brunt never varied it in the\n      telling. He had no education.",
                "Shackles came to the Chedputter Autumn races one year, and his owner\n      walked about insulting the sportsmen of Chedputter generally, till they\n      went to the Honorary Secretary in a body and said: -- \"Appoint\n      Handicappers, and arrange a race which shall break Shackles and humble the\n      pride of his owner.\" The Districts rose against Shackles and sent up of\n      their best; Ousel, who was supposed to be able to do his mile in 1-53;\n      Petard, the stud-bred, trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how to\n      train; Gringalet, the ewe-lamb of the 75th; Bobolink, the pride of\n      Peshawar; and many others.",
                "They called that race The Broken-Link Handicap, because it was to smash\n      Shackles; and the Handicappers piled on the weights, and the Fund gave\n      eight hundred rupees, and the distance was \"round the course for all\n      horses.\" Shackles' owner said: -- \"You can arrange the race with regard\n      to Shackles only. So long as you don't bury him under weight-cloths, I\n      don't mind.\" Regula Baddun's owner said: -- \"I throw in my mare to fret\n      Ousel. Six furlongs is Regula's distance, and she will then lie down and\n      die. So also will Ousel, for his jockey doesn't understand a waiting\n      race.\" Now, this was a lie, for Regula had been in work for two months at\n      Dehra, and her chances were good, always supposing that Shackles broke a\n      blood-vessel -- OR BRUNT MOVED ON HIM.",
                "The plunging in the lotteries was fine. They filled eight thousand rupee\n      lotteries on the Broken Link Handicap, and the account in the Pioneer said\n      that \"favoritism was divided.\" In plain English, the various contingents\n      were wild on their respective horses; for the Handicappers had done their\n      work well. The Honorary Secretary shouted himself hoarse through the din;\n      and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke, and the rattling of the\n      dice-boxes like the rattle of small-arm fire.",
                "Ten horses started -- very level -- and Regula Baddun's owner\n      cantered out on his back to a place inside the circle of the course, where\n      two bricks had been thrown. He faced towards the brick-mounds at the lower\n      end of the course and waited.",
                "he story of the running is in the Pioneer. At the end of the first mile,\n      Shackles crept out of the ruck, well on the outside, ready to get round\n      the turn, lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the others\n      knew he had got away. Brunt was sitting still, perfectly happy, listening\n      to the \"drum, drum, drum\" of the hoofs behind, and knowing that, in about\n      twenty strides, Shackles would draw one deep breath and go up the last\n      half-mile like the \"Flying Dutchman.\" As Shackles went short to take the\n      turn and came abreast of the brick-mound, Brunt heard, above the noise of\n      the wind in his ears, a whining, wailing voice on the offside, saying: -- \"God\n      ha' mercy, I'm done for!\" In one stride, Brunt saw the whole seething\n      smash of the Maribyrnong Plate before him, started in his saddle and gave\n      a yell of terror. The start brought the heels into Shackles' side, and the\n      scream hurt Shackles' feelings. He couldn't stop dead; but he put out his\n      feet and slid along for fifty yards, and then, very gravely and\n      judicially, bucked off Brunt -- a shaking, terror-stricken lump, while\n      Regula Baddun made a neck-and-neck race with Bobolink up the straight, and\n      won by a short head -- Petard a bad third. Shackles' owner, in the\n      Stand, tried to think that his field-glasses had gone wrong. Regula\n      Baddun's owner, waiting by the two bricks, gave one deep sigh of relief,\n      and cantered back to the stand. He had won, in lotteries and bets, about\n      fifteen thousand.",
                "It was a broken-link Handicap with a vengeance. It broke nearly all the\n      men concerned, and nearly broke the heart of Shackles' owner.",
                "He went down to interview Brunt. The boy lay, livid and gasping with\n      fright, where he had tumbled off. The sin of losing the race never seemed\n      to strike him. All he knew was that Whalley had \"called\" him, that the\n      \"call\" was a warning; and, were he cut in two for it, he would never get\n      up again. His nerve had gone altogether, and he only asked his master to\n      give him a good thrashing, and let him go. He was fit for nothing, he\n      said. He got his dismissal, and crept up to the paddock, white as chalk,\n      with blue lips, his knees giving way under him. People said nasty things\n      in the paddock; but Brunt never heeded. He changed into tweeds, took his\n      stick and went down the road, still shaking with fright, and muttering\n      over and over again: -- \"God ha' mercy, I'm done for!\" To the best of\n      my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth.",
                "So now you know how the Broken-Link Handicap was run and won. Of course\n      you don't believe it. You would credit anything about Russia's designs on\n      India, or the recommendations of the Currency Commission; but a little bit\n      of sober fact is more than you can stand!"

At\n      the head of the Gully is a big cow-byre, and the walls on either side of\n      the Gully are without windows. Neither Suchet Singh nor Gaur Chand\n      approved of their women-folk looking into the world. If Durga Charan had\n      been of their opinion, he would have been a happier man today, and little\n      Bisesa would have been able to knead her own bread. Her room looked out\n      through the grated window into the narrow dark Gully where the sun never\n      came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue slime. She was a widow,\n      about fifteen years old, and she prayed the Gods, day and night, to send\n      her a lover; for she did not approve of living alone.",

                "Then he saw that the Gully ended in a trap, and heard a little laugh from\n      behind the grated window. It was a pretty little laugh, and Trejago,\n      knowing that, for all practical purposes, the old Arabian Nights are good\n      guides, went forward to the window, and whispered that verse of \"The Love\n      Song of Har Dyal\" which begins:",
                "Can a man stand upright in the face of the naked Sun;\n    or a Lover in the Presence of his Beloved?\n  If my feet fail me, O Heart of my Heart, am I to blame,\n    being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty?",
                "There came the faint tchinks of a woman's bracelets from behind the\n      grating, and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse:",
                "Alas! alas! Can the Moon tell the Lotus of her love when the\n   Gate of Heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains?\n  They have taken my Beloved, and driven her with the pack-horses\n    to the North.\n  There are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart.\n  Call to the bowman to make ready --",
                "The voice stopped suddenly, and Trejago walked out of Amir Nath's Gully,\n      wondering who in the world could have capped \"The Love Song of Har Dyal\"\n       so neatly.",
                "Next morning, as he was driving to the office, an old woman threw a packet\n      into his dog-cart. In the packet was the half of a broken glass bangle,\n      one flower of the blood red dhak, a pinch of bhusa or cattle-food, and\n      eleven cardamoms. That packet was a letter -- not a clumsy compromising\n      letter, but an innocent, unintelligible lover's epistle.",
                "Trejago knew far too much about these things, as I have said. No\n      Englishman should be able to translate object-letters. But Trejago spread\n      all the trifles on the lid of his office-box and began to puzzle them out.",
                "A broken glass-bangle stands for a Hindu widow all India over; because,\n      when her husband dies a woman's bracelets are broken on her wrists.\n      Trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass.",
                "The flower of the dhak means diversely \"desire,\" \"come,\" \"write,\" or\n      \"danger,\" according to the other things with it. One cardamom means\n      \"jealousy;\" but when any article is duplicated in an object-letter, it\n      loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number\n      indicating time, or, if incense, curds, or saffron be sent also, place.\n      The message ran then: -- \"A widow dhak flower and bhusa -- at eleven\n      o'clock.\" The pinch of bhusa enlightened Trejago. He saw -- this kind\n      of letter leaves much to instinctive knowledge -- that the bhusa\n      referred to the big heap of cattle-food over which he had fallen in Amir\n      Nath's Gully, and that the message must come from the person behind the\n      grating; she being a widow. So the message ran then: -- \"A widow, in\n      the Gully in which is the heap of bhusa, desires you to come at eleven\n      o'clock.\"",
                "Trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed. He knew that\n      men in the East do not make love under windows at eleven in the forenoon,\n      nor do women fix appointments a week in advance.",
                "So he went, that very night at eleven, into Amir Nath's Gully, clad in a\n      boorka, which cloaks a man as well as a woman. Directly the gongs in the\n      City made the hour, the little voice behind the grating took up \"The Love\n      Song of Har Dyal\" at the verse where the Panthan girl calls upon Har Dyal\n      to return. The song is really pretty in the Vernacular. In English you\n      miss the wail of it. It runs something like this: --",
                "Alone upon the housetops, to the North\n     I turn and watch the lightning in the sky, -- \n    The glamour of thy footsteps in the North,\n     Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!\n\n    Below my feet the still bazar is laid\n     Far, far below the weary camels lie, -- \n    The camels and the captives of thy raid,\n     Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!\n\n    My father's wife is old and harsh with years,\n     And drudge of all my father's house am I. -- \n    My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears,\n     Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!",
                "As the song stopped, Trejago stepped up under the grating and whispered: -- \"I\n      am here.\"",
                "Bisesa was good to look upon.",
                "That night was the beginning of many strange things, and of a double life\n      so wild that Trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a dream.\n      Bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the object-letter had detached\n      the heavy grating from the brick-work of the wall; so that the window slid\n      inside, leaving only a square of raw masonry, into which an active man\n      might climb.",
                "In the day-time, Trejago drove through his routine of office-work, or put\n      on his calling-clothes and called on the ladies of the Station; wondering\n      how long they would know him if they knew of poor little Bisesa. At night,\n      when all the City was still, came the walk under the evil-smelling boorka,\n      the patrol through Jitha Megji's bustee, the quick turn into Amir Nath's\n      Gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead walls, and then, last of\n      all, Bisesa, and the deep, even breathing of the old woman who slept\n      outside the door of the bare little room that Durga Charan allotted to his\n      sister's daughter. Who or what Durga Charan was, Trejago never inquired;\n      and why in the world he was not discovered and knifed never occurred to\n      him till his madness was over, and Bisesa... But this comes later.",
                "Bisesa was an endless delight to Trejago. She was as ignorant as a bird;\n      and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had\n      reached her in her room, amused Trejago almost as much as her lisping\n      attempts to pronounce his name -- \"Christopher.\" The first syllable was\n      always more than she could manage, and she made funny little gestures with\n      her rose-leaf hands, as one throwing the name away, and then, kneeling\n      before Trejago, asked him, exactly as an Englishwoman would do, if he were\n      sure he loved her. Trejago swore that he loved her more than any one else\n      in the world. Which was true.",
                "After a month of this folly, the exigencies of his other life compelled\n      Trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance. You may\n      take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed and\n      discussed by a man's own race, but by some hundred and fifty natives as\n      well. Trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the\n      Band-stand, and once or twice to drive with her; never for an instant\n      dreaming that this would affect his dearer out-of-the-way life. But the\n      news flew, in the usual mysterious fashion, from mouth to mouth, till\n      Bisesa's duenna heard of it and told Bisesa. The child was so troubled\n      that she did the household work evilly, and was beaten by Durga Charan's\n      wife in consequence.",
                "A week later, Bisesa taxed Trejago with the flirtation. She understood no\n      gradations and spoke openly. Trejago laughed and Bisesa stamped her little\n      feet -- little feet, light as marigold flowers, that could lie in the\n      palm of a man's one hand.",
                "Much that is written about \"Oriental passion and impulsiveness\" is\n      exaggerated and compiled at second-hand, but a little of it is true; and\n      when an Englishman finds that little, it is quite as startling as any\n      passion in his own proper life. Bisesa raged and stormed, and finally\n      threatened to kill herself if Trejago did not at once drop the alien\n      Memsahib who had come between them. Trejago tried to explain, and to show\n      her that she did not understand these things from a Western standpoint.\n      Bisesa drew herself up, and said simply:",
                "\"I do not. I know only this -- it is not good that I should have made\n      you dearer than my own heart to me, Sahib. You are an Englishman. I am\n      only a black girl\" -- she was fairer than bar-gold in the Mint -- and\n      the widow of a black man.",
                "Then she sobbed and said: \"But on my soul and my Mother's soul, I love\n      you. There shall no harm come to you, whatever happens to me.\"",
                "Trejago argued with the child, and tried to soothe her, but she seemed\n      quite unreasonably disturbed. Nothing would satisfy her save that all\n      relations between them should end. He was to go away at once. And he went.\n      As he dropped out at the window, she kissed his forehead twice, and he\n      walked away wondering.",
                "A week, and then three weeks, passed without a sign from Bisesa.",
                "Trejago, thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough, went down\n      to Amir Nath's Gully for the fifth time in the three weeks, hoping that\n      his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered. He was not\n      disappointed.",
                "There was a young moon, and one stream of light fell down into Amir Nath's\n      Gully, and struck the grating, which was drawn away as he knocked. From\n      the black dark, Bisesa held out her arms into the moonlight. Both hands\n      had been cut off at the wrists, and the stumps were nearly healed.",
                "Then, as Bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed, some one in\n      the room grunted like a wild beast, and something sharp -- knife, sword\n      or spear -- thrust at Trejago in his boorka. The stroke missed his\n      body, but cut into one of the muscles of the groin, and he limped slightly\n      from the wound for the rest of his days.",
                "The grating went into its place. There was no sign whatever from inside\n      the house -- nothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall, and the\n      blackness of Amir Nath's Gully behind.",
                "The next thing Trejago remembers, after raging and shouting like a madman\n      between those pitiless walls, is that he found himself near the river as\n      the dawn was breaking, threw away his boorka and went home bareheaded.",
                "What the tragedy was -- whether Bisesa had, in a fit of causeless\n      despair, told everything, or the intrigue had been discovered and she\n      tortured to tell, whether Durga Charan knew his name, and what became of\n      Bisesa -- Trejago does not know to this day. Something horrible had\n      happened, and the thought of what it must have been comes upon Trejago in\n      the night now and again, and keeps him company till the morning. One\n      special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the front\n      of Durga Charan's house. It may open on to a courtyard common to two or\n      more houses, or it may lie behind any one of the gates of Jitha Megji's\n      bustee. Trejago cannot tell.",
                "He cannot get Bisesa -- poor little Bisesa -- back again. He has\n      lost her in the City, where each man's house is as guarded and as\n      unknowable as the grave; and the grating that opens into Amir Nath's Gully\n      has been walled up.",
                "But Trejago pays his calls regularly, and is reckoned a very decent sort\n      of man.",
                "There is nothing peculiar about him, except a slight stiffness, caused by\n      a riding-strain, in the right leg."

                "Because Mrs. Reiver was cold and hard, he said she was stately and\n      dignified. Because she had no brains, and could not talk cleverly, he said\n      she was reserved and shy. Mrs. Reiver shy! Because she was unworthy of\n      honor or reverence from any one, he reverenced her from a distance and\n      dowered her with all the virtues in the Bible and most of those in\n      Shakespeare.",
                "This big, dark, abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered\n      behind him, used to moon in the train of Mrs. Reiver, blushing with\n      pleasure when she threw a word or two his way. His admiration was strictly\n      platonic: even other women saw and admitted this. He did not move out in\n      Simla, so he heard nothing against his idol: which was satisfactory. Mrs.\n      Reiver took no special notice of him, beyond seeing that he was added to\n      her list of admirers, and going for a walk with him now and then, just to\n      show that he was her property, claimable as such. Moriarty must have done\n      most of the talking, for Mrs. Reiver couldn't talk much to a man of his\n      stamp; and the little she said could not have been profitable. What\n      Moriarty believed in, as he had good reason to, was Mrs. Reiver's\n      influence over him, and, in that belief, set himself seriously to try to\n      do away with the vice that only he himself knew of.",
                "His experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar, but\n      he never described them. Sometimes he would hold off from everything\n      except water for a week. Then, on a rainy night, when no one had asked him\n      out to dinner, and there was a big fire in his room, and everything\n      comfortable, he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding little\n      nip to little nip, planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile, until he\n      threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk. He suffered next morning.",
                "One night, the big crash came. He was troubled in his own mind over his\n      attempts to make himself \"worthy of the friendship\" of Mrs. Reiver. The\n      past ten days had been very bad ones, and the end of it all was that he\n      received the arrears of two and three-quarter years of sipping in one\n      attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind; beginning with suicidal\n      depression, going on to fits and starts and hysteria, and ending with\n      downright raving. As he sat in a chair in front of the fire, or walked up\n      and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces, you heard what poor\n      Moriarty really thought of Mrs. Reiver, for he raved about her and his own\n      fall for the most part; though he ravelled some P. W. D. accounts into the\n      same skein of thought. He talked, and talked, and talked in a low dry\n      whisper to himself, and there was no stopping him. He seemed to know that\n      there was something wrong, and twice tried to pull himself together and\n      confer rationally with the Doctor; but his mind ran out of control at\n      once, and he fell back to a whisper and the story of his troubles. It is\n      terrible to hear a big man babbling like a child of all that a man usually\n      locks up, and puts away in the deep of his heart. Moriarty read out his\n      very soul for the benefit of any one who was in the room between\n      ten-thirty that night and two-forty-five next morning.",
                "From what he said, one gathered how immense an influence Mrs. Reiver held\n      over him, and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse. His whisperings\n      cannot, of course, be put down here; but they were very instructive as\n      showing the errors of his estimates..........",
                "When the trouble was over, and his few acquaintances were pitying him for\n      the bad attack of jungle-fever that had so pulled him down, Moriarty swore\n      a big oath to himself and went abroad again with Mrs. Reiver till the end\n      of the season, adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an angel from\n      heaven. Later on he took to riding -- not hacking, but honest riding -- which\n      was good proof that he was improving, and you could slam doors behind him\n      without his jumping to his feet with a gasp. That, again, was hopeful.",
                "How he kept his oath, and what it cost him in the beginning, nobody knows.\n      He certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who has drank\n      heavily can do. He took his peg and wine at dinner, but he never drank\n      alone, and never let what he drank have the least hold on him.",
                "Once he told a bosom-friend the story of his great trouble, and how the\n      \"influence of a pure honest woman, and an angel as well\" had saved him.\n      When the man -- startled at anything good being laid to Mrs. Reiver's\n      door -- laughed, it cost him Moriarty's friendship.",
                "Moriarty, who is married now to a woman ten thousand times better than\n      Mrs. Reiver -- a woman who believes that there is no man on earth as\n      good and clever as her husband -- will go down to his grave vowing and\n      protesting that Mrs. Reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds.",
                "That she knew anything of Moriarty's weakness nobody believed for a\n      moment. That she would have cut him dead, thrown him over, and acquainted\n      all her friends with her discovery, if she had known of it, nobody who\n      knew her doubted for an instant.",
                "oriarty thought her something she never was, and in that belief saved\n      himself. Which was just as good as though she had been everything that he\n      had imagined.",
                "But the question is, what claim will Mrs. Reiver have to the credit of\n      Moriarty's salvation, when her day of reckoning comes?"

He was\n      the man who worked the big fraud on the Sind and Sialkote Bank. He was\n      manager of an up-country Branch, and a sound practical man with a large\n      experience of native loan and insurance work. He could combine the\n      frivolities of ordinary life with his work, and yet do well. Reggie Burke\n      rode anything that would let him get up, danced as neatly as he rode, and\n      was wanted for every sort of amusement in the Station.",

He would recognize you, but you would have some\n      trouble in recognizing him.",
                "The Directors of the Bank -- it had its headquarters in Calcutta and\n      its General Manager's word carried weight with the Government -- picked\n      their men well. They had tested Reggie up to a fairly severe\n      breaking-strain. They trusted him just as much as Directors ever trust\n      Managers. You must see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced.",
                "Reggie's Branch was in a big Station, and worked with the usual staff -- one\n      Manager, one Accountant, both English, a Cashier, and a horde of native\n      clerks; besides the Police patrol at nights outside.",
                "The bulk of its work, for it was in a thriving district, was hoondi and\n      accommodation of all kinds. A fool has no grip of this sort of business;\n      and a clever man who does not go about among his clients, and know more\n      than a little of their affairs, is worse than a fool.",
                "Reggie was young-looking, clean-shaved, with a twinkle in his eye, and a\n      head that nothing short of a gallon of the Gunners' Madeira could make any\n      impression on.",
                "One day, at a big dinner, he announced casually that the Directors had\n      shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity, from England, in the Accountant\n      line. He was perfectly correct. Mr. Silas Riley, Accountant, was a MOST\n      curious animal -- a long, gawky, rawboned Yorkshireman, full of the\n      savage self-conceit that blossoms only in the best county in England.\n      Arrogance was a mild word for the mental attitude of Mr. S. Riley. He had\n      worked himself up, after seven years, to a Cashier's position in a\n      Huddersfield Bank; and all his experience lay among the factories of the\n      North. Perhaps he would have done better on the Bombay side, where they\n      are happy with one-half per cent. profits, and money is cheap. He was\n      useless for Upper India and a wheat Province, where a man wants a large\n      head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a satisfactory\n      balance-sheet.",
                "He was wonderfully narrow-minded in business, and, being new to the\n      country, had no notion that Indian banking is totally distinct from Home\n      work. Like most clever self-made men, he had much simplicity in his\n      nature; and, somehow or other, had construed the ordinarily polite terms\n      of his letter of engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen\n      him on account of his special and brilliant talents, and that they set\n      great store by him. This notion grew and crystallized; thus adding to his\n      natural North-country conceit.",
                "Further, he was delicate, suffered from some trouble in his chest, and was\n      short in his temper.",
                "You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a Natural\n      Curiosity. The two men failed to hit it off at all. Riley considered\n      Reggie a wild, feather-headed idiot, given to Heaven only knew what\n      dissipation in low places called \"Messes,\" and totally unfit for the\n      serious and solemn vocation of banking. He could never get over Reggie's\n      look of youth and \"you-be-damned\" air; and he couldn't understand Reggie's\n      friends -- clean-built, careless men in the Army -- who rode over to\n      big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank, and told sultry stories till Riley got\n      up and left the room. Riley was always showing Reggie how the business\n      ought to be conducted, and Reggie had more than once to remind him that\n      seven years' limited experience between Huddersfield and Beverly did not\n      qualify a man to steer a big up-country business. Then Riley sulked and\n      referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a cherished friend of the\n      Directors, and Reggie tore his hair. If a man's English subordinates fail\n      him in this country, he comes to a hard time indeed, for native help has\n      strict limitations. In the winter Riley went sick for weeks at a time with\n      his lung complaint, and this threw more work on Reggie. But he preferred\n      it to the everlasting friction when Riley was well.",
                "One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses\n      and reported them to the Directors. Now Riley had been foisted on the Bank\n      by an M. P., who wanted the support of Riley's father, who, again, was\n      anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those lungs. The\n      M. P. had an interest in the Bank; but one of the Directors wanted to\n      advance a nominee of his own; and, after Riley's father had died, he made\n      the rest of the Board see that an Accountant who was sick for half the\n      year, had better give place to a healthy man. If Riley had known the real\n      story of his appointment, he might have behaved better; but knowing\n      nothing, his stretches of sickness alternated with restless, persistent,\n      meddling irritation of Reggie, and all the hundred ways in which conceit\n      in a subordinate situation can find play. Reggie used to call him striking\n      and hair-curling names behind his back as a relief to his own feelings;\n      but he never abused him to his face, because he said: \"Riley is such a\n      frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due to pains in the\n      chest.\"",
                "Late one April, Riley went very sick indeed. The doctor punched him and\n      thumped him, and told him he would be better before long. Then the doctor\n      went to Reggie and said: -- \"Do you know how sick your Accountant is?\"\n       \"No!\" said Reggie -- \"The worse the better, confound him! He's a\n      clacking nuisance when he's well. I'll let you take away the Bank Safe if\n      you can drug him silent for this hot-weather.\"",
                "But the doctor did not laugh -- \"Man, I'm not joking,\" he said. \"I'll\n      give him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in.\n      On my honor and reputation that's all the grace he has in this world.\n      Consumption has hold of him to the marrow.\"",
                "Reggie's face changed at once into the face of \"Mr. Reginald Burke,\" and\n      he answered: -- \"What can I do?\"",
                "\"Nothing,\" said the doctor. \"For all practical purposes the man is dead\n      already. Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him he's going to recover.\n      That's all. I'll look after him to the end, of course.\"",
                "The doctor went away, and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail.",
                "His first letter was one from the Directors, intimating for his\n      information that Mr. Riley was to resign, under a month's notice, by the\n      terms of his agreement, telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would\n      follow and advising Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant, a man whom\n      Reggie knew and liked.",
                "Reggie lit a cheroot, and, before he had finished smoking, he had sketched\n      the outline of a fraud. He put away -- \"burked\" -- the Directors\n      letter, and went in to talk to Riley, who was as ungracious as usual, and\n      fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness. He\n      never thought of the extra work on Reggie's shoulders, but solely of the\n      damage to his own prospects of advancement. Then Reggie assured him that\n      everything would be well, and that he, Reggie, would confer with Riley\n      daily on the management of the Bank. Riley was a little soothed, but he\n      hinted in as many words that he did not think much of Reggie's business\n      capacity.",
                "Reggie was humble. And he had letters in his desk from the Directors that\n      a Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of!",
                "The days passed in the big darkened house, and the Directors' letter of\n      dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie, who, every evening,\n      brought the books to Riley's room, and showed him what had been going\n      forward, while Riley snarled. Reggie did his best to make statements\n      pleasing to Riley, but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going to\n      rack and ruin without him. In June, as the lying in bed told on his\n      spirit, he asked whether his absence had been noted by the Directors, and\n      Reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters, hoping that he\n      would be able to resume his valuable services before long. He showed Riley\n      the letters: and Riley said that the Directors ought to have written to\n      him direct.",
                "A few days later, Reggie opened Riley's mail in the half-light of the\n      room, and gave him the sheet -- not the envelope -- of a letter to\n      Riley from the Directors. Riley said he would thank Reggie not to\n      interfere with his private papers, specially as Reggie knew he was too\n      weak to open his own letters. Reggie apologized.",
                "Then Riley's mood changed, and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways: his\n      horses and his bad friends. \"Of course, lying here on my back, Mr. Burke,\n      I can't keep you straight; but when I'm well, I DO hope you'll pay some\n      heed to my words.\" Reggie, who had dropped polo, and dinners, and tennis,\n      and all to attend to Riley, said that he was penitent and settled Riley's\n      head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in hard, dry, hacking\n      whispers, without a sign of impatience. This at the end of a heavy day's\n      office work, doing double duty, in the latter half of June.",
                "When the new Accountant came, Reggie told him the facts of the case, and\n      announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him. Riley said that\n      he might have had more consideration than to entertain his \"doubtful\n      friends\" at such a time. Reggie made Carron, the new Accountant, sleep at\n      the Club in consequence. Carron's arrival took some of the heavy work off\n      his shoulders, and he had time to attend to Riley's exactions -- to\n      explain, soothe, invent, and settle and resettle the poor wretch in bed,\n      and to forge complimentary letters from Calcutta. At the end of the first\n      month, Riley wished to send some money home to his mother. Reggie sent the\n      draft. At the end of the second month, Riley's salary came in just the\n      same. Reggie paid it out of his own pocket; and, with it, wrote Riley a\n      beautiful letter from the Directors.",
                "Riley was very ill indeed, but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily. Now\n      and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future, sketching\n      plans for going Home and seeing his mother.",
                "Reggie listened patiently when the office work was over, and encouraged\n      him.",
                "At other times Riley insisted on Reggie's reading the Bible and grim\n      \"Methody\" tracts to him. Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed at\n      his Manager. But he always found time to worry Reggie about the working of\n      the Bank, and to show him where the weak points lay.",
                "This in-door, sick-room life and constant strains wore Reggie down a good\n      deal, and shook his nerves, and lowered his billiard-play by forty points.\n      But the business of the Bank, and the business of the sick-room, had to go\n      on, though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade.",
                "At the end of the third month, Riley was sinking fast, and had begun to\n      realize that he was very sick. But the conceit that made him worry Reggie,\n      kept him from believing the worst. \"He wants some sort of mental stimulant\n      if he is to drag on,\" said the doctor.",
                "\"Keep him interested in life if you care about his living.\" So Riley,\n      contrary to all the laws of business and the finance, received a\n      25-per-cent, rise of salary from the Directors. The \"mental stimulant\"\n       succeeded beautifully. Riley was happy and cheerful, and, as is often the\n      case in consumption, healthiest in mind when the body was weakest. He\n      lingered for a full month, snarling and fretting about the Bank, talking\n      of the future, hearing the Bible read, lecturing Reggie on sin, and\n      wondering when he would be able to move abroad.",
                "But at the end of September, one mercilessly hot evening, he rose up in\n      his bed with a little gasp, and said quickly to Reggie: -- \"Mr. Burke,\n      I am going to die. I know it in myself. My chest is all hollow inside, and\n      there's nothing to breathe with. To the best of my knowledge I have done\n      nowt\" -- he was returning to the talk of his boyhood -- \"to lie\n      heavy on my conscience. God be thanked, I have been preserved from the\n      grosser forms of sin; and I counsel YOU, Mr. Burke....\"",
                "Here his voice died down, and Reggie stooped over him.",
                "\"Send my salary for September to my mother.... done great things with the\n      Bank if I had been spared.... mistaken policy.... no fault of mine.\"",
                "Then he turned his face to the wall and died.",
                "Reggie drew the sheet over Its face, and went out into the verandah, with\n      his last \"mental stimulant\" -- a letter of condolence and sympathy from\n      the Directors -- unused in his pocket.",
                "\"If I'd been only ten minutes earlier,\" thought Reggie, \"I might have\n      heartened him up to pull through another day.\""

Even\n      Futteh Khan, the villainous loafer khit from Mussoorie, shirked risking\n      Tods' displeasure for fear his co-mates should look down on him.",
                "So Tods had honor in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla, and ruled\n      justly according to his lights. Of course, he spoke Urdu, but he had also\n      mastered many queer side-speeches like the chotee bolee of the women, and\n      held grave converse with shopkeepers and Hill-coolies alike. He was\n      precocious for his age, and his mixing with natives had taught him some of\n      the more bitter truths of life; the meanness and the sordidness of it. He\n      used, over his bread and milk, to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms,\n      translated from the vernacular into the English, that made his Mamma jump\n      and vow that Tods MUST go home next hot weather.",
                "Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power, the Supreme Legislature were\n      hacking out a Bill, for the Sub-Montane Tracts, a revision of the then\n      Act, smaller than the Punjab Land Bill, but affecting a few hundred\n      thousand people none the less. The Legal Member had built, and bolstered,\n      and embroidered, and amended that Bill, till it looked beautiful on paper.\n      Then the Council began to settle what they called the \"minor details.\" As\n      if any Englishman legislating for natives knows enough to know which are\n      the minor and which are the major points, from the native point of view,\n      of any measure! That Bill was a triumph of \"safe-guarding the interests of\n      the tenant.\" One clause provided that land should not be leased on longer\n      terms than five years at a stretch; because, if the landlord had a tenant\n      bound down for, say, twenty years, he would squeeze the very life out of\n      him. The notion was to keep up a stream of independent cultivators in the\n      Sub-Montane Tracts; and ethnologically and politically the notion was\n      correct. The only drawback was that it was altogether wrong. A native's\n      life in India implies the life of his son. Wherefore, you cannot legislate\n      for one generation at a time. You must consider the next from the native\n      point of view. Curiously enough, the native now and then, and in Northern\n      India more particularly, hates being over-protected against himself. There\n      was a Naga village once, where they lived on dead AND buried Commissariat\n      mules.... But that is another story.",
                "For many reasons, to be explained later, the people concerned objected to\n      the Bill. The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as he\n      knew about Charing Cross. He had said in Calcutta that \"the Bill was\n      entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class, the\n      cultivators;\" and so on, and so on. The Legal Member's knowledge of\n      natives was limited to English-speaking Durbaris, and his own red\n      chaprassis, the Sub-Montane Tracts concerned no one in particular, the\n      Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too driven to make representations,\n      and the measure was one which dealt with small landholders only.\n      Nevertheless, the Legal Member prayed that it might be correct, for he was\n      a nervously conscientious man. He did not know that no man can tell what\n      natives think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off. And not\n      always then. But he did the best he knew. And the measure came up to the\n      Supreme Council for the final touches, while Tods patrolled the Burra\n      Simla Bazar in his morning rides, and played with the monkey belonging to\n      Ditta Mull, the bunnia, and listened, as a child listens to all the stray\n      talk about this new freak of the Lat Sahib's.",
                "One day there was a dinner-party, at the house of Tods' Mamma, and the\n      Legal Member came. Tods was in bed, but he kept awake till he heard the\n      bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee. Then he paddled out in\n      his little red flannel dressing-gown and his night-suit, and took refuge\n      by the side of his father, knowing that he would not be sent back. \"See\n      the miseries of having a family!\" said Tods' father, giving Tods three\n      prunes, some water in a glass that had been used for claret, and telling\n      him to sit still. Tods sucked the prunes slowly, knowing that he would\n      have to go when they were finished, and sipped the pink water like a man\n      of the world, as he listened to the conversation. Presently, the Legal\n      Member, talking \"shop,\" to the Head of a Department, mentioned his Bill by\n      its full name -- \"The Sub-Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment.\"\n       Tods caught the one native word, and lifting up his small voice said: -- \"Oh,\n      I know ALL about that! Has it been murramutted yet, Councillor Sahib?\"",
                "\"How much?\" said the Legal Member.",
                "\"Murramutted -- mended. -- Put theek, you know -- made nice to\n      please Ditta Mull!\"",
                "The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods.",
                "\"What do you know about Ryotwari, little man?\" he said.",
                "\"I'm not a little man, I'm Tods, and I know ALL about it. Ditta Mull, and\n      Choga Lall, and Amir Nath, and -- oh, lakhs of my friends tell me about\n      it in the bazars when I talk to them.\"",
                "\"Oh, they do -- do they? What do they say, Tods?\"",
                "Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressing-gown and said: -- \"I\n      must fink.\"",
                "The Legal Member waited patiently. Then Tods, with infinite compassion:",
                "\"You don't speak my talk, do you, Councillor Sahib?\"",
                "\"No; I am sorry to say I do not,\" said the Legal' Member.",
                "\"Very well,\" said Tods. \"I must fink in English.\"",
                "He spent a minute putting his ideas in order, and began very slowly,\n      translating in his mind from the vernacular to English, as many\n      Anglo-Indian children do. You must remember that the Legal Member helped\n      him on by questions when he halted, for Tods was not equal to the\n      sustained flight of oratory that follows.",
                "\"Ditta Mull says: -- 'This thing is the talk of a child, and was made\n      up by fools.' But I don't think you are a fool, Councillor Sahib,\" said\n      Tods, hastily. \"You caught my goat. This is what Ditta Mull says: -- 'I\n      am not a fool, and why should the Sirkar say I am a child? I can see if\n      the land is good and if the landlord is good. If I am a fool, the sin is\n      upon my own head. For five years I take my ground for which I have saved\n      money, and a wife I take too, and a little son is born.' Ditta Mull has\n      one daughter now, but he SAYS he will have a son, soon. And he says: 'At\n      the end of five years, by this new bundobust, I must go. If I do not go, I\n      must get fresh seals and takkus-stamps on the papers, perhaps in the\n      middle of the harvest, and to go to the law-courts once is wisdom, but to\n      go twice is Jehannum.' That is QUITE true,\" explained Tods, gravely. \"All\n      my friends say so. And Ditta Mull says: -- 'Always fresh takkus and\n      paying money to vakils and chaprassis and law-courts every five years or\n      else the landlord makes me go. Why do I want to go? Am I fool? If I am a\n      fool and do not know, after forty years, good land when I see it, let me\n      die! But if the new bundobust says for FIFTEEN years, then it is good and\n      wise. My little son is a man, and I am burnt, and he takes the ground or\n      another ground, paying only once for the takkus-stamps on the papers, and\n      his little son is born, and at the end of fifteen years is a man too. But\n      what profit is there in five years and fresh papers? Nothing but dikh,\n      trouble, dikh. We are not young men who take these lands, but old ones -- not\n      jais, but tradesmen with a little money -- and for fifteen years we\n      shall have peace. Nor are we children that the Sirkar should treat us so.\"",
                "Here Tods stopped short, for the whole table were listening. The Legal\n      Member said to Tods: \"Is that all?\"",
                "\"All I can remember,\" said Tods. \"But you should see Ditta Mull's big\n      monkey. It's just like a Councillor Sahib.\"",
                "\"Tods! Go to bed,\" said his father.",
                "Tods gathered up his dressing-gown tail and departed.",
                "The Legal Member brought his hand down on the table with a crash -- \"By\n      Jove!\" said the Legal Member, \"I believe the boy is right. The short\n      tenure IS the weak point.\"",
                "He left early, thinking over what Tods had said. Now, it was obviously\n      impossible for the Legal Member to play with a bunnia's monkey, by way of\n      getting understanding; but he did better. He made inquiries, always\n      bearing in mind the fact that the real native -- not the hybrid,\n      University-trained mule -- is as timid as a colt, and, little by\n      little, he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most\n      intimately to give in their views, which squared very closely with Tods'\n      evidence.",
                "So the Bill was amended in that clause; and the Legal Member was filled\n      with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very little except\n      the Orders they carry on their bosoms. But he put the thought from him as\n      illiberal. He was a most Liberal Man.",
                "After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the Bill\n      recast in the tenure clause, and if Tods' Mamma had not interfered, Tods\n      would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio nuts\n      and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah. Till he went\n      Home, Tods ranked some few degrees before the Viceroy in popular\n      estimation. But for the little life of him Tods could not understand why.",
                "In the Legal Member's private-paper-box still lies the rough draft of the\n      Sub-Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment; and, opposite the\n      twenty-second clause, pencilled in blue chalk, and signed by the Legal\n      Member, are the words \"Tods' Amendment.\""

                "Dicky Hatt was kidnapped in his early, early youth -- neither by\n      landlady's daughter, housemaid, barmaid, nor cook, but by a girl so nearly\n      of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just the least\n      little bit in the world below it. This happened a month before he came out\n      to India, and five days after his one-and-twentieth birthday. The girl was\n      nineteen -- six years older than Dicky in the things of this world,\n      that is to say -- and, for the time, twice as foolish as he.",
                "Excepting, always, falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally easy\n      than marriage before the Registrar. The ceremony costs less than fifty\n      shillings, and is remarkably like walking into a pawn-shop. After the\n      declarations of residence have been put in, four minutes will cover the\n      rest of the proceedings -- fees, attestation, and all. Then the\n      Registrar slides the blotting-pad over the names, and says grimly, with\n      his pen between his teeth: -- \"Now you're man and wife;\" and the couple\n      walk out into the street, feeling as if something were horribly illegal\n      somewhere.",
                "But that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just as\n      thoroughly as the \"long as ye both shall live\" curse from the altar-rails,\n      with the bridesmaids giggling behind, and \"The Voice that breathed o'er\n      Eden\" lifting the roof off. In this manner was Dicky Hatt kidnapped, and\n      he considered it vastly fine, for he had received an appointment in India\n      which carried a magnificent salary from the Home point of view. The\n      marriage was to be kept secret for a year. Then Mrs. Dicky Hatt was to\n      come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious golden mist. That was\n      how they sketched it under the Addison Road Station lamps; and, after one\n      short month, came Gravesend and Dicky steaming out to his new life, and\n      the girl crying in a thirty-shillings a week bed-and-living room, in a\n      back street off Montpelier Square near the Knightsbridge Barracks.",
                "But the country that Dicky came to was a hard land, where \"men\" of\n      twenty-one were reckoned very small boys indeed, and life was expensive.\n      The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far.\n      Particularly when Dicky divided it by two, and remitted more than the fair\n      half, at 1-6, to Montpelier Square. One hundred and thirty-five rupees out\n      of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on; but it was absurd to\n      suppose that Mrs. Hatt could exist forever on the 20 pounds held back by\n      Dicky, from his outfit allowance. Dicky saw this, and remitted at once;\n      always remembering that Rs. 700 were to be paid, twelve months later, for\n      a first-class passage out for a lady. When you add to these trifling\n      details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a new life in a new\n      country and longing to go about and enjoy himself, and the necessity for\n      grappling with strange work -- which, properly speaking, should take up\n      a boy's undivided attention -- you will see that Dicky started\n      handicapped. He saw it himself for a breath or two; but he did not guess\n      the full beauty of his future.",
                "As the hot weather began, the shackles settled on him and ate into his\n      flesh. First would come letters -- big, crossed, seven sheet letters -- from\n      his wife, telling him how she longed to see him, and what a Heaven upon\n      earth would be their property when they met.",
                "Then some boy of the chummery wherein Dicky lodged would pound on the door\n      of his bare little room, and tell him to come out and look at a pony -- the\n      very thing to suit him. Dicky could not afford ponies. He had to explain\n      this. Dicky could not afford living in the chummery, modest as it was. He\n      had to explain this before he moved to a single room next the office where\n      he worked all day. He kept house on a green oil-cloth table-cover, one\n      chair, one charpoy, one photograph, one tooth-glass, very strong and\n      thick, a seven-rupee eight-anna filter, and messing by contract at\n      thirty-seven rupees a month. Which last item was extortion. He had no\n      punkah, for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month; but he slept on the\n      roof of the office with all his wife's letters under his pillow. Now and\n      again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a punkah and an iced\n      drink. But this was seldom, for people objected to recognizing a boy who\n      had evidently the instincts of a Scotch tallow-chandler, and who lived in\n      such a nasty fashion. Dicky could not subscribe to any amusement, so he\n      found no amusement except the pleasure of turning over his Bank-book and\n      reading what it said about \"loans on approved security.\" That cost\n      nothing. He remitted through a Bombay Bank, by the way, and the Station\n      knew nothing of his private affairs.",
                "Every month he sent Home all he could possibly spare for his wife -- and\n      for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and would\n      require more money.",
                "About this time, Dicky was overtaken with the nervous, haunting fear that\n      besets married men when they are out of sorts. He had no pension to look\n      to. What if he should die suddenly, and leave his wife unprovided for? The\n      thought used to lay hold of him in the still, hot nights on the roof, till\n      the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to die then and\n      there of heart-disease.",
                "Now this is a frame of mind which no boy has a right to know. It is a\n      strong man's trouble; but, coming when it did, it nearly drove poor\n      punkah-less, perspiring Dicky Hatt mad. He could tell no one about it.",
                "A certain amount of \"screw\" is as necessary for a man as for a\n      billiard-ball. It makes them both do wonderful things. Dicky needed money\n      badly, and he worked for it like a horse. But, naturally, the men who\n      owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain income -- pay\n      in India is a matter of age, not merit, you see, and if their particular\n      boy wished to work like two boys, Business forbid that they should stop\n      him! But Business forbid that they should give him an increase of pay at\n      his present ridiculously immature age! So Dicky won certain rises of\n      salary -- ample for a boy -- not enough for a wife and child -- certainly\n      too little for the seven-hundred-rupee passage that he and Mrs. Hatt had\n      discussed so lightly once upon a time. And with this he was forced to be\n      content.",
                "Somehow, all his money seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the crushing\n      Exchange, and the tone of the Home letters changed and grew querulous.\n      \"Why wouldn't Dicky have his wife and the baby out? Surely he had a salary -- a\n      fine salary -- and it was too bad of him to enjoy himself in India. But\n      would he -- could he -- make the next draft a little more elastic?\"\n       Here followed a list of baby's kit, as long as a Parsee's bill. Then\n      Dicky, whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son he had never\n      seen -- which, again, is a feeling no boy is entitled to -- enlarged\n      the draft and wrote queer half-boy, half-man letters, saying that life was\n      not so enjoyable after all and would the little wife wait yet a little\n      longer? But the little wife, however much she approved of money, objected\n      to waiting, and there was a strange, hard sort of ring in her letters that\n      Dicky didn't understand. How could he, poor boy?",
                "Later on still -- just as Dicky had been told -- apropos of another\n      youngster who had \"made a fool of himself,\" as the saying is -- that\n      matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement, but\n      would lose him his present appointment -- came the news that the baby,\n      his own little, little son, had died, and, behind this, forty lines of an\n      angry woman's scrawl, saying that death might have been averted if certain\n      things, all costing money, had been done, or if the mother and the baby\n      had been with Dicky. The letter struck at Dicky's naked heart; but, not\n      being officially entitled to a baby, he could show no sign of trouble.",
                "How Dicky won through the next four months, and what hope he kept alight\n      to force him into his work, no one dare say. He pounded on, the\n      seven-hundred-rupee passage as far away as ever, and his style of living\n      unchanged, except when he launched into a new filter.",
                "There was the strain of his office-work, and the strain of his\n      remittances, and the knowledge of his boy's death, which touched the boy\n      more, perhaps, than it would have touched a man; and, beyond all, the\n      enduring strain of his daily life. Gray-headed seniors, who approved of\n      his thrift and his fashion of denying himself everything pleasant,\n      reminded him of the old saw that says:",
                "\"If a youth would be distinguished in his art, art, art,\n    He must keep the girls away from his heart, heart, heart.\"",
                "And Dicky, who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is\n      permitted to know, had to laugh and agree; with the last line of his\n      balanced Bank-book jingling in his head day and night.",
                "But he had one more sorrow to digest before the end. There arrived a\n      letter from the little wife -- the natural sequence of the others if\n      Dicky had only known it -- and the burden of that letter was \"gone with\n      a handsomer man than you.\" It was a rather curious production, without\n      stops, something like this: -- \"She was not going to wait forever and\n      the baby was dead and Dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on\n      her again and why hadn't he waved his handkerchief to her when he left\n      Gravesend and God was her judge she was a wicked woman but Dicky was worse\n      enjoying himself in India and this other man loved the ground she trod on\n      and would Dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive Dicky; and\n      there was no address to write to.\"",
                "Instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free, Dicky discovered\n      exactly how an injured husband feels -- again, not at all the knowledge\n      to which a boy is entitled -- for his mind went back to his wife as he\n      remembered her in the thirty-shilling \"suite\" in Montpelier Square, when\n      the dawn of his last morning in England was breaking, and she was crying\n      in the bed. Whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers. He\n      never stopped to think whether, if he had met Mrs. Hatt after those two\n      years, he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite different\n      and new persons. This, theoretically, he ought to have done. He spent the\n      night after the English Mail came in rather severe pain.",
                "Next morning, Dicky Hatt felt disinclined to work. He argued that he had\n      missed the pleasure of youth. He was tired, and he had tasted all the\n      sorrow in life before three-and-twenty. His Honor was gone -- that was\n      the man; and now he, too, would go to the Devil -- that was the boy in\n      him. So he put his head down on the green oil-cloth table-cover, and wept\n      before resigning his post, and all it offered.",
                "But the reward of his services came. He was given three days to reconsider\n      himself, and the Head of the establishment, after some telegraphings, said\n      that it was a most unusual step, but, in view of the ability that Mr. Hatt\n      had displayed at such and such a time, at such and such junctures, he was\n      in a position to offer him an infinitely superior post -- first on\n      probation, and later, in the natural course of things, on confirmation.\n      \"And how much does the post carry?\" said Dicky. \"Six hundred and fifty\n      rupees,\" said the Head slowly, expecting to see the young man sink with\n      gratitude and joy.",
                "And it came then! The seven hundred rupee passage, and enough to have\n      saved the wife, and the little son, and to have allowed of assured and\n      open marriage, came then. Dicky burst into a roar of laughter -- laughter\n      he could not check -- nasty, jangling merriment that seemed as if it\n      would go on forever. When he had recovered himself he said, quite\n      seriously: -- \"I'm tired of work. I'm an old man now. It's about time I\n      retired. And I will.\"",
                "\"The boy's mad!\" said the Head.",
                "I think he was right; but Dicky Hatt never reappeared to settle the\n      question."

                "PIG.",
                "Go, stalk the red deer o'er the heather\n     Ride, follow the fox if you can!\n   But, for pleasure and profit together,\n     Allow me the hunting of Man, -- \n   The chase of the Human, the search for the Soul\n     To its ruin, -- the hunting of Man.\n                 -- The Old Shikarri.",
                "I believe the difference began in the matter of a horse, with a twist in\n      his temper, whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was\n      nearly slain. There may have been other causes of offence; the horse was\n      the official stalking-horse. Nafferton was very angry; but Pinecoffin\n      laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beast's manners.\n      Nafferton laughed, too, though he vowed that he would write off his fall\n      against Pinecoffin if he waited five years. Now, a Dalesman from beyond\n      Skipton will forgive an injury when the Strid lets a man live; but a South\n      Devon man is as soft as a Dartmoor bog. You can see from their names that\n      Nafferton had the race-advantage of Pinecoffin. He was a peculiar man, and\n      his notions of humor were cruel. He taught me a new and fascinating form\n      of shikar. He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot to Jagadri, and from\n      Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab, a large province and in\n      places remarkably dry. He said that he had no intention of allowing\n      Assistant Commissioners to \"sell him pups,\" in the shape of ramping,\n      screaming countrybreds, without making their lives a burden to them.",
                "Most Assistant Commissioners develop a bent for some special work after\n      their first hot weather in the country. The boys with digestions hope to\n      write their names large on the Frontier and struggle for dreary places\n      like Bannu and Kohat. The bilious ones climb into the Secretariat. Which\n      is very bad for the liver.",
                "Others are bitten with a mania for District work, Ghuznivide coins or\n      Persian poetry; while some, who come of farmers' stock, find that the\n      smell of the Earth after the Rains gets into their blood, and calls them\n      to \"develop the resources of the Province.\" These men are enthusiasts.\n      Pinecoffin belonged to their class. He knew a great many facts bearing on\n      the cost of bullocks and temporary wells, and opium-scrapers, and what\n      happens if you burn too much rubbish on a field, in the hope of enriching\n      used-up soil. All the Pinecoffins come of a landholding breed, and so the\n      land only took back her own again. Unfortunately -- most unfortunately\n      for Pinecoffin -- he was a Civilian, as well as a farmer. Nafferton\n      watched him, and thought about the horse. Nafferton said: -- \"See me\n      chase that boy till he drops!\" I said: -- \"You can't get your knife\n      into an Assistant Commissioner.\" Nafferton told me that I did not\n      understand the administration of the Province.",
                "Our Government is rather peculiar. It gushes on the agricultural and\n      general information side, and will supply a moderately respectable man\n      with all sorts of \"economic statistics,\" if he speaks to it prettily. For\n      instance, you are interested in gold-washing in the sands of the Sutlej.\n      You pull the string, and find that it wakes up half a dozen Departments,\n      and finally communicates, say, with a friend of yours in the Telegraph,\n      who once wrote some notes on the customs of the gold-washers when he was\n      on construction-work in their part of the Empire. He may or may not be\n      pleased at being ordered to write out everything he knows for your\n      benefit. This depends on his temperament. The bigger man you are, the more\n      information and the greater trouble can you raise.",
                "Nafferton was not a big man; but he had the reputation of being very\n      \"earnest.\" An \"earnest\" man can do much with a Government. There was an\n      earnest man who once nearly wrecked... but all India knows THAT story. I\n      am not sure what real \"earnestness\" is. A very fair imitation can be\n      manufactured by neglecting to dress decently, by mooning about in a\n      dreamy, misty sort of way, by taking office-work home after staying in\n      office till seven, and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on Sundays.\n      That is one sort of \"earnestness.\"",
                "Nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness, and for a\n      string that would communicate with Pinecoffin. He found both.",
                "They were Pig. Nafferton became an earnest inquirer after Pig. He informed\n      the Government that he had a scheme whereby a very large percentage of the\n      British Army in India could be fed, at a very large saving, on Pig. Then\n      he hinted that Pinecoffin might supply him with the \"varied information\n      necessary to the proper inception of the scheme.\" So the Government wrote\n      on the back of the letter: -- \"Instruct Mr. Pinecoffin to furnish Mr.\n      Nafferton with any information in his power.\" Government is very prone to\n      writing things on the backs of letters which, later, lead to trouble and\n      confusion.",
                "Nafferton had not the faintest interest in Pig, but he knew that\n      Pinecoffin would flounce into the trap. Pinecoffin was delighted at being\n      consulted about Pig. The Indian Pig is not exactly an important factor in\n      agricultural life; but Nafferton explained to Pinecoffin that there was\n      room for improvement, and corresponded direct with that young man.",
                "You may think that there is not much to be evolved from Pig. It all\n      depends how you set to work. Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing to do\n      things thoroughly, began with an essay on the Primitive Pig, the Mythology\n      of the Pig, and the Dravidian Pig.",
                "Nafferton filed that information -- twenty-seven foolscap sheets -- and\n      wanted to know about the distribution of the Pig in the Punjab, and how it\n      stood the Plains in the hot weather. From this point onwards, remember\n      that I am giving you only the barest outlines of the affair -- the\n      guy-ropes, as it were, of the web that Nafferton spun round Pinecoffin.",
                "Pinecoffin made a colored Pig-population map, and collected observations\n      on the comparative longevity of the Pig (a) in the sub-montane tracts of\n      the Himalayas, and (b) in the Rechna Doab.",
                "Nafferton filed that, and asked what sort of people looked after Pig. This\n      started an ethnological excursus on swineherds, and drew from Pinecoffin\n      long tables showing the proportion per thousand of the caste in the\n      Derajat. Nafferton filed that bundle, and explained that the figures which\n      he wanted referred to the Cis-Sutlej states, where he understood that Pigs\n      were very fine and large, and where he proposed to start a Piggery. By\n      this time, Government had quite forgotten their instructions to Mr.\n      Pinecoffin.",
                "They were like the gentlemen, in Keats' poem, who turned well-oiled wheels\n      to skin other people. But Pinecoffin was just entering into the spirit of\n      the Pig-hunt, as Nafferton well knew he would do. He had a fair amount of\n      work of his own to clear away; but he sat up of nights reducing Pig to\n      five places of decimals for the honor of his Service. He was not going to\n      appear ignorant of so easy a subject as Pig.",
                "Then Government sent him on special duty to Kohat, to \"inquire into\" the\n      big-seven-foot, iron-shod spades of that District. People had been killing\n      each other with those peaceful tools; and Government wished to know\n      \"whether a modified form of agricultural implement could not, tentatively\n      and as a temporary measure, be introduced among the agricultural\n      population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the existing\n      religious sentiments of the peasantry.\"",
                "Between those spades and Nafferton's Pig, Pinecoffin was rather heavily\nburdened.\n\n Nafferton now began to take up \"(a) The food-supply of the indigenous Pig,\nwith a view to the improvement of its capacities as a flesh-former.\n(b) The acclimatization of the exotic Pig, maintaining its distinctive\npeculiarities.\" Pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic Pig\nwould become merged in the indigenous type; and quoted horse-breeding\nstatistics to prove this.",
                "The side-issue was debated, at great length on Pinecoffin's side, till\n      Nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong, and moved the previous\n      question. When Pinecoffin had quite written himself out about\n      flesh-formers, and fibrins, and glucose and the nitrogenous constituents\n      of maize and lucerne, Nafferton raised the question of expense. By this\n      time Pinecoffin, who had been transferred from Kohat, had developed a Pig\n      theory of his own, which he stated in thirty-three folio pages -- all\n      carefully filed by Nafferton. Who asked for more.",
                "These things took ten months, and Pinecoffin's interest in the potential\n      Piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views. But\n      Nafferton bombarded him with letters on \"the Imperial aspect of the\n      scheme, as tending to officialize the sale of pork, and thereby calculated\n      to give offence to the Mahomedan population of Upper India.\" He guessed\n      that Pinecoffin would want some broad, free-hand work after his niggling,\n      stippling, decimal details.",
                "Pinecoffin handled the latest development of the case in masterly style,\n      and proved that no \"popular ebullition of excitement was to be\n      apprehended.\" Nafferton said that there was nothing like Civilian insight\n      in matters of this kind, and lured him up a bye-path -- \"the possible\n      profits to accrue to the Government from the sale of hog-bristles.\" There\n      is an extensive literature of hog-bristles, and the shoe, brush, and\n      colorman's trades recognize more varieties of bristles than you would\n      think possible. After Pinecoffin had wondered a little at Nafferton's rage\n      for information, he sent back a monograph, fifty-one pages, on \"Products\n      of the Pig.\" This led him, under Nafferton's tender handling, straight to\n      the Cawnpore factories, the trade in hog-skin for saddles -- and thence\n      to the tanners. Pinecoffin wrote that pomegranate-seed was the best cure\n      for hog-skin, and suggested -- for the past fourteen months had wearied\n      him -- that Nafferton should \"raise his pigs before he tanned them.\"",
                "Nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question.",
                "How could the exotic Pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in the\n      West and yet \"assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its\n      oriental congener?\" Pinecoffin felt dazed, for he had forgotten what he\n      had written sixteen month's before, and fancied that he was about to\n      reopen the entire question. He was too far involved in the hideous tangle\n      to retreat, and, in a weak moment, he wrote: -- \"Consult my first\n      letter.\" Which related to the Dravidian Pig. As a matter of fact,\n      Pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage; having gone off\n      on a side-issue on the merging of types.",
                "THEN Nafferton really unmasked his batteries! He complained to the\n      Government, in stately language, of \"the paucity of help accorded to me in\n      my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry, and the\n      flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a\n      gentleman whose pseudo-scholarly attainments should at lest have taught\n      him the primary differences between the Dravidian and the Berkshire\n      variety of the genus Sus. If I am to understand that the letter to which\n      he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a\n      valuable, though possibly uncleanly, animal, I am reluctantly compelled to\n      believe,\" etc., etc.",
                "There was a new man at the head of the Department of Castigation.",
                "The wretched Pinecoffin was told that the Service was made for the\n      Country, and not the Country for the Service, and that he had better begin\n      to supply information about Pigs.",
                "Pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could be\n      written about Pig, and that some furlough was due to him.",
                "Nafferton got a copy of that letter, and sent it, with the essay on the\n      Dravidian Pig, to a down-country paper, which printed both in full. The\n      essay was rather highflown; but if the Editor had seen the stacks of\n      paper, in Pinecoffin's handwriting, on Nafferton's table, he would not\n      have been so sarcastic about the \"nebulous discursiveness and blatant\n      self-sufficiency of the modern Competition-wallah, and his utter inability\n      to grasp the practical issues of a practical question.\" Many friends cut\n      out these remarks and sent them to Pinecoffin.",
                "I have already stated that Pinecoffin came of a soft stock. This last\n      stroke frightened and shook him. He could not understand it; but he felt\n      he had been, somehow, shamelessly betrayed by Nafferton.",
                "He realized that he had wrapped himself up in the Pigskin without need,\n      and that he could not well set himself right with his Government. All his\n      acquaintances asked after his \"nebulous discursiveness\" or his \"blatant\n      self-sufficiency,\" and this made him miserable.",
                "He took a train and went to Nafferton, whom he had not seen since the Pig\n      business began. He also took the cutting from the paper, and blustered\n      feebly and called Nafferton names, and then died down to a watery, weak\n      protest of the \"I-say-it's-too-bad-you-know\" order.",
                "Nafferton was very sympathetic.",
                "\"I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?\" said he.",
                "\"Trouble!\" whimpered Pinecoffin; \"I don't mind the trouble so much, though\n      that was bad enough; but what I resent is this showing up in print. It\n      will stick to me like a burr all through my service. And I DID do my best\n      for your interminable swine. It's too bad of you, on my soul it is!\"",
                "\"I don't know,\" said Nafferton; \"have you ever been stuck with a horse? It\n      isn't the money I mind, though that is bad enough; but what I resent is\n      the chaff that follows, especially from the boy who stuck me. But I think\n      we'll cry quite now.\"",
                "Pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words; and Nafferton smiled ever\n      so sweetly, and asked him to dinner."

                "THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.",
                "It was not in the open fight\n     We threw away the sword,\n   But in the lonely watching\n     In the darkness by the ford.\n\n   The waters lapped, the night-wind blew,\n   Full-armed the Fear was born and grew,\n   And we were flying ere we knew\n     From panic in the night.\n              -- Beoni Bar.",
                "Some people hold that an English Cavalry regiment cannot run. This is a\n      mistake. I have seen four hundred and thirty-seven sabres flying over the\n      face of the country in abject terror -- have seen the best Regiment\n      that ever drew bridle, wiped off the Army List for the space of two hours.\n      If you repeat this tale to the White Hussars they will, in all\n      probability, treat you severely. They are not proud of the incident.",
                "You may know the White Hussars by their \"side,\" which is greater than that\n      of all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster. If this is not a sufficient\n      mark, you may know them by their old brandy. It has been sixty years in\n      the Mess and is worth going far to taste.",
                "Ask for the \"McGaire\" old brandy, and see that you get it. If the Mess\n      Sergeant thinks that you are uneducated, and that the genuine article will\n      be lost on you, he will treat you accordingly. He is a good man. But, when\n      you are at Mess, you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or\n      long-distance rides. The Mess are very sensitive; and, if they think that\n      you are laughing at them, will tell you so.",
                "As the White Hussars say, it was all the Colonel's fault. He was a new\n      man, and he ought never to have taken the Command. He said that the\n      Regiment was not smart enough. This to the White Hussars, who knew they\n      could walk round any Horse and through any Guns, and over any Foot on the\n      face of the earth! That insult was the first cause of offence.",
                "Then the Colonel cast the Drum-Horse -- the Drum-Horse of the White\n      Hussars! Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had\n      committed. I will try to make it clear. The soul of the Regiment lives in\n      the Drum-Horse, who carries the silver kettle-drums. He is nearly always a\n      big piebald Waler. That is a point of honor; and a Regiment will spend\n      anything you please on a piebald. He is beyond the ordinary laws of\n      casting. His work is very light, and he only manoeuvres at a foot-pace.\n      Wherefore, so long as he can step out and look handsome, his well-being is\n      assured. He knows more about the Regiment than the Adjutant, and could not\n      make a mistake if he tried.",
                "The Drum-Horse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old, and\n      perfectly equal to his duties. He had at least six years' more work in\n      him, and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a Drum-Major of\n      the Guards. The Regiment had paid Rs. 1,200 for him.",
                "But the Colonel said that he must go, and he was cast in due form and\n      replaced by a washy, bay beast as ugly as a mule, with a ewe-neck,\n      rat-tail, and cow-hocks. The Drummer detested that animal, and the best of\n      the Band-horses put back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at\n      the very sight of him. They knew him for an upstart and no gentleman. I\n      fancy that the Colonel's ideas of smartness extended to the Band, and that\n      he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade movements. A Cavalry\n      Band is a sacred thing. It only turns out for Commanding Officers'\n      parades, and the Band Master is one degree more important than the\n      Colonel. He is a High Priest and the \"Keel Row\" is his holy song. The\n      \"Keel Row\" is the Cavalry Trot; and the man who has never heard that tune\n      rising, high and shrill, above the rattle of the Regiment going past the\n      saluting-base, has something yet to hear and understand.",
                "When the Colonel cast the Drum-horse of the White Hussars, there was\n      nearly a mutiny.",
                "The officers were angry, the Regiment were furious, and the Bandsman swore -- like\n      troopers. The Drum-Horse was going to be put up to auction -- public\n      auction -- to be bought, perhaps, by a Parsee and put into a cart! It\n      was worse than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the whole world,\n      or selling the Mess Plate to a Jew -- a black Jew.",
                "The Colonel was a mean man and a bully. He knew what the Regiment thought\n      about his action; and, when the troopers offered to buy the Drum-Horse, he\n      said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the Regulations.",
                "But one of the Subalterns -- Hogan-Yale, an Irishman -- bought the\n      Drum-Horse for Rs. 160 at the sale; and the Colonel was wroth. Yale\n      professed repentance -- he was unnaturally submissive -- and said\n      that, as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible\n      ill-treatment and starvation, he would now shoot him and end the business.\n      This appeared to soothe the Colonel, for he wanted the Drum-Horse disposed\n      of. He felt that he had made a mistake, and could not of course\n      acknowledge it. Meantime, the presence of the Drum-Horse was an annoyance\n      to him.",
                "Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy, three cheroots, and his\n      friend, Martyn; and they all left the Mess together. Yale and Martyn\n      conferred for two hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier who\n      keeps watch over Yale's boot-trees knows what they said. A horse, hooded\n      and sheeted to his ears, left Yale's stables and was taken, very\n      unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's groom went with him. Two men\n      broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint-pots and some\n      large scenery brushes. Then night fell over the Cantonments, and there was\n      a noise as of a horse kicking his loose-box to pieces in Yale's stables.\n      Yale had a big, old, white Waler trap-horse.",
                "The next day was a Thursday, and the men, hearing that Yale was going to\n      shoot the Drum-Horse in the evening, determined to give the beast a\n      regular regimental funeral -- a finer one than they would have given\n      the Colonel had he died just then. They got a bullock-cart and some\n      sacking, and mounds and mounds of roses, and the body, under sacking, was\n      carried out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated; two-thirds\n      of the Regiment followed. There was no Band, but they all sang \"The Place\n      where the old Horse died\" as something respectful and appropriate to the\n      occasion. When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began\n      throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it, the Farrier-Sergeant ripped\n      out an oath and said aloud: -- \"Why, it ain't the Drum-Horse any more\n      than it's me!\" The Troop-Sergeant-Majors asked him whether he had left his\n      head in the Canteen. The Farrier-Sergeant said that he knew the\n      Drum-Horse's feet as well as he knew his own; but he was silenced when he\n      saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff, upturned near-fore.",
                "Thus was the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars buried; the Farrier-Sergeant\n      grumbling. The sacking that covered the corpse was smeared in places with\n      black paint; and the Farrier-Sergeant drew attention to this fact. But the\n      Troop-Sergeant-Major of E Troop kicked him severely on the shin, and told\n      him that he was undoubtedly drunk.",
                "On the Monday following the burial, the Colonel sought revenge on the\n      White Hussars. Unfortunately, being at that time temporarily in Command of\n      the Station, he ordered a Brigade field-day. He said that he wished to\n      make the regiment \"sweat for their damned insolence,\" and he carried out\n      his notion thoroughly. That Monday was one of the hardest days in the\n      memory of the White Hussars.",
                "They were thrown against a skeleton-enemy, and pushed forward, and\n      withdrawn, and dismounted, and \"scientifically handled\" in every possible\n      fashion over dusty country, till they sweated profusely.",
                "Their only amusement came late in the day, when they fell upon the battery\n      of Horse Artillery and chased it for two mile's. This was a personal\n      question, and most of the troopers had money on the event; the Gunners\n      saying openly that they had the legs of the White Hussars. They were\n      wrong. A march-past concluded the campaign, and when the Regiment got back\n      to their Lines, the men were coated with dirt from spur to chin-strap.",
                "The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege. They won it at\n      Fontenoy, I think.",
                "Many Regiments possess special rights, such as wearing collars with\n      undress uniform, or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders, or red and\n      white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year. Some rights are\n      connected with regimental saints, and some with regimental successes. All\n      are valued highly; but none so highly as the right of the White Hussars to\n      have the Band playing when their horses are being watered in the Lines.\n      Only one tune is played, and that tune never varies. I don't know its real\n      name, but the White Hussars call it: -- \"Take me to London again.\" It\n      sounds very pretty. The Regiment would sooner be struck off the roster\n      than forego their distinction.",
                "After the \"dismiss\" was sounded, the officers rode off home to prepare for\n      stables; and the men filed into the lines, riding easy.",
                "That is to say, they opened their tight buttons, shifted their helmets,\n      and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them; the more careful\n      slipping off and easing girths and curbs. A good trooper values his mount\n      exactly as much as he values himself, and believes, or should believe,\n      that the two together are irresistible where women or men, girls or guns,\n      are concerned.",
                "Then the Orderly-Officer gave the order: -- \"Water horses,\" and the\n      Regiment loafed off to the squadron-troughs, which were in rear of the\n      stables and between these and the barracks. There were four huge troughs,\n      one for each squadron, arranged en echelon, so that the whole Regiment\n      could water in ten minutes if it liked. But it lingered for seventeen, as\n      a rule, while the Band played.",
                "The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men\n      slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other.",
                "The sun was just setting in a big, hot bed of red cloud, and the road to\n      the Civil Lines seemed to run straight into the sun's eye.",
                "There was a little dot on the road. It grew and grew till it showed as a\n      horse, with a sort of gridiron thing on his back. The red cloud glared\n      through the bars of the gridiron. Some of the troopers shaded their eyes\n      with their hands and said: -- \"What the mischief as that there 'orse\n      got on 'im!\"",
                "In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul -- horse and man -- in\n      the Regiment knew, and saw, heading straight towards the Band, the dead\n      Drum-Horse of the White Hussars!",
                "On his withers banged and bumped the kettle-drums draped in crape, and on\n      his back, very stiff and soldierly, sat a bare-headed skeleton.",
                "The band stopped playing, and, for a moment, there was a hush.",
                "Then some one in E troop -- men said it was the Troop-Sergeant-Major -- swung\n      his horse round and yelled. No one can account exactly for what happened\n      afterwards; but it seems that, at least, one man in each troop set an\n      example of panic, and the rest followed like sheep. The horses that had\n      barely put their muzzles into the trough's reared and capered; but, as\n      soon as the Band broke, which it did when the ghost of the Drum-Horse was\n      about a furlong distant, all hooves followed suit, and the clatter of the\n      stampede -- quite different from the orderly throb and roar of a\n      movement on parade, or the rough horse-play of watering in camp -- made\n      them only more terrified. They felt that the men on their backs were\n      afraid of something. When horses once know THAT, all is over except the\n      butchery.",
                "Troop after troop turned from the troughs and ran -- anywhere, and\n      everywhere -- like spilt quicksilver. It was a most extraordinary\n      spectacle, for men and horses were in all stages of easiness, and the\n      carbine-buckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on. Men were\n      shouting and cursing, and trying to pull clear of the Band which was being\n      chased by the Drum-Horse whose rider had fallen forward and seemed to be\n      spurring for a wager.",
                "The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink. Most of the officers\n      were with him, and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down to\n      the lines, and receive the watering reports from the Troop-Sergeant\n      Majors. When \"Take me to London again\" stopped, after twenty bars, every\n      one in the Mess said: -- \"What on earth has happened?\" A minute later,\n      they heard unmilitary noises, and saw, far across the plain, the White\n      Hussars scattered, and broken, and flying.",
                "The Colonel was speechless with rage, for he thought that the Regiment had\n      risen against him or was unanimously drunk. The Band, a disorganized mob,\n      tore past, and at its heels labored the Drum-Horse -- the dead and\n      buried Drum-Horse -- with the jolting, clattering skeleton. Hogan-Yale\n      whispered softly to Martyn: -- \"No wire will stand that treatment,\" and\n      the Band, which had doubled like a hare, came back again. But the rest of\n      the Regiment was gone, was rioting all over the Province, for the dusk had\n      shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the Drum-Horse was\n      on his flank.",
                "Troop-Horses are far too tenderly treated as a rule. They can, on\n      emergencies, do a great deal, even with seventeen stone on their backs. As\n      the troopers found out.",
                "How long this panic lasted I cannot say. I believe that when the moon rose\n      the men saw they had nothing to fear, and, by twos and threes and\n      half-troops, crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of themselves.\n      Meantime, the Drum-Horse, disgusted at his treatment by old friends,\n      pulled up, wheeled round, and trotted up to the Mess verandah-steps for\n      bread. No one liked to run; but no one cared to go forward till the\n      Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeleton's foot. The Band had\n      halted some distance away, and now came back slowly. The Colonel called\n      it, individually and collectively, every evil name that occurred to him at\n      the time; for he had set his hand on the bosom of the Drum-Horse and found\n      flesh and blood. Then he beat the kettle-drums with his clenched fist, and\n      discovered that they were but made of silvered paper and bamboo. Next,\n      still swearing, he tried to drag the skeleton out of the saddle, but found\n      that it had been wired into the cantle. The sight of the Colonel, with his\n      arms round the skeleton's pelvis and his knee in the old Drum-Horse's\n      stomach, was striking. Not to say amusing. He worried the thing off in a\n      minute or two, and threw it down on the ground, saying to the Band: -- \"Here,\n      you curs, that's what you're afraid of.\" The skeleton did not look pretty\n      in the twilight. The Band-Sergeant seemed to recognize it, for he began to\n      chuckle and choke. \"Shall I take it away, sir?\" said the Band-Sergeant.\n      \"Yes,\" said the Colonel, \"take it to Hell, and ride there yourselves!\"",
                "The Band-Sergeant saluted, hoisted the skeleton across his saddle-bow, and\n      led off to the stables. Then the Colonel began to make inquiries for the\n      rest of the Regiment, and the language he used was wonderful. He would\n      disband the Regiment -- he would court-martial every soul in it -- he\n      would not command such a set of rabble, and so on, and so on. As the men\n      dropped in, his language grew wilder, until at last it exceeded the utmost\n      limits of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse.",
                "Martyn took Hogan-Yale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the\n      service as a necessity when all was discovered. Martyn was the weaker man\n      of the two, Hogan-Yale put up his eyebrows and remarked, firstly, that he\n      was the son of a Lord, and secondly, that he was as innocent as the babe\n      unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the Drum-Horse.",
                "\"My instructions,\" said Yale, with a singularly sweet smile, \"were that\n      the Drum-Horse should be sent back as impressively as possible. I ask you,\n      AM I responsible if a mule-headed friend sends him back in such a manner\n      as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her Majesty's Cavalry?\"",
                "Martyn said: -- \"you are a great man and will in time become a General;\n      but I'd give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair.\"",
                "Providence saved Martyn and Hogan-Yale. The Second-in-Command led the\n      Colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of the\n      white Hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights; and there, after\n      many oaths on the Colonel's part, they talked together in low tones. I\n      fancy that the Second-in-Command must have represented the scare as the\n      work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect; and I know that\n      he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public laughingstock of\n      the scare.",
                "\"They will call us,\" said the Second-in-Command, who had really a fine\n      imagination, \"they will call us the 'Fly-by-Nights'; they will call us the\n      'Ghost Hunters'; they will nickname us from one end of the Army list to\n      the other. All the explanations in the world won't make outsiders\n      understand that the officers were away when the panic began. For the honor\n      of the Regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet.\"",
                "The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so\n      difficult as might be imagined. He was made to see, gently and by degrees,\n      that it was obviously impossible to court-martial the whole Regiment, and\n      equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who, in his belief,\n      had any concern in the hoax.",
                "\"But the beast's alive! He's never been shot at all!\" shouted the Colonel.\n      \"It's flat, flagrant disobedience! I've known a man broke for less, d --  -- d\n      sight less. They're mocking me, I tell you, Mutman! They're mocking me!\"",
                "Once more, the Second-in-Command set himself to sooth the Colonel, and\n      wrestled with him for half-an-hour. At the end of that time, the\n      Regimental Sergeant-Major reported himself. The situation was rather novel\n      tell to him; but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances. He\n      saluted and said: \"Regiment all come back, Sir.\" Then, to propitiate the\n      Colonel: -- \"An' none of the horses any the worse, Sir.\"",
                "The Colonel only snorted and answered: -- \"You'd better tuck the men\n      into their cots, then, and see that they don't wake up and cry in the\n      night.\" The Sergeant withdrew.",
                "His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel, and, further, he felt\n      slightly ashamed of the language he had been using. The Second-in-Command\n      worried him again, and the two sat talking far into the night.",
                "Next day but one, there was a Commanding Officer's parade, and the Colonel\n      harangued the White Hussars vigorously. The pith of his speech was that,\n      since the Drum-Horse in his old age had proved himself capable of cutting\n      up the Whole Regiment, he should return to his post of pride at the head\n      of the band, BUT the Regiment were a set of ruffians with bad consciences.",
                "The White Hussars shouted, and threw everything movable about them into\n      the air, and when the parade was over, they cheered the Colonel till they\n      couldn't speak. No cheers were put up for Lieutenant Hogan-Yale, who\n      smiled very sweetly in the background.",
                "Said the Second-in-Command to the Colonel, unofficially: -- \"These\n      little things ensure popularity, and do not the least affect discipline.\"",
                "\"But I went back on my word,\" said the Colonel.",
                "\"Never mind,\" said the Second-in-Command. \"The White Hussars will follow\n      you anywhere from today. Regiments are just like women. They will do\n      anything for trinketry.\"",
                "A week later, Hogan-Yale received an extraordinary letter from some one\n      who signed himself \"Secretary Charity and Zeal, 3709, E. C.,\" and asked\n      for \"the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your\n      possession.\"",
                "\"Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones?\" said Hogan-Yale.",
                "\"Beg your pardon, Sir,\" said the Band-Sergeant, \"but the skeleton is with\n      me, an' I'll return it if you'll pay the carriage into the Civil Lines.\n      There's a coffin with it, Sir.\"",
                "Hogan-Yale smiled and handed two rupees to the Band-Sergeant, saying: -- \"Write\n      the date on the skull, will you?\"",
                "If you doubt this story, and know where to go, you can see the date on the\n      skeleton. But don't mention the matter to the White Hussars.",
                "I happen to know something about it, because I prepared the Drum-Horse for\n      his resurrection. He did not take kindly to the skeleton at all."

                "THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.",
                "In the daytime, when she moved about me,\n     In the night, when she was sleeping at my side, -- \n    I was wearied, I was wearied of her presence.\n\n    Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her -- \n     Would to God that she or I had died!\n                 -- Confessions.",
                "There was a man called Bronckhorst -- a three-cornered, middle-aged man\n      in the Army -- gray as a badger, and, some people said, with a touch of\n      country-blood in him. That, however, cannot be proved.",
                "Mrs. Bronckhorst was not exactly young, though fifteen years younger than\n      her husband. She was a large, pale, quiet woman, with heavy eyelids, over\n      weak eyes, and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it.",
                "Bronckhorst was not nice in any way. He had no respect for the pretty\n      public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is. His\n      manner towards his wife was coarse. There are many things -- including\n      actual assault with the clenched fist -- that a wife will endure; but\n      seldom a wife can bear -- as Mrs. Bronckhorst bore -- with a long\n      course of brutal, hard chaff, making light of her weaknesses, her\n      headaches, her small fits of gaiety, her dresses, her queer little\n      attempts to make herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she\n      is not what she has been, and -- worst of all -- the love that she\n      spends on her children. That particular sort of heavy-handed jest was\n      specially dear to Bronckhorst. I suppose that he had first slipped into\n      it, meaning no harm, in the honeymoon, when folk find their ordinary stock\n      of endearments run short, and so go to the other extreme to express their\n      feelings. A similar impulse makes a man say: -- \"Hutt, you old beast!\"\n       when a favorite horse nuzzles his coat-front. Unluckily, when the reaction\n      of marriage sets in, the form of speech remains, and, the tenderness\n      having died out, hurts the wife more than she cares to say. But Mrs.\n      Bronckhorst was devoted to her \"Teddy,\" as she called him.",
                "Perhaps that was why he objected to her. Perhaps -- this is only a\n      theory to account for his infamous behavior later on -- he gave way to\n      the queer savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband\n      twenty years' married, when he sees, across the table, the same face of\n      his wedded wife, and knows that, as he has sat facing it, so must he\n      continue to sit until day of its death or his own.",
                "Most men and all women know the spasm. It only lasts for three breaths as\n      a rule, must be a \"throw-back\" to times when men and women were rather\n      worse than they are now, and is too unpleasant to be discussed.",
                "Dinner at the Bronckhorst's was an infliction few men cared to undergo.\n      Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince.\n      When their little boy came in at dessert, Bronckhorst used to give him\n      half a glass of wine, and naturally enough, the poor little mite got first\n      riotous, next miserable, and was removed screaming. Bronckhorst asked if\n      that was the way Teddy usually behaved, and whether Mrs. Bronckhorst could\n      not spare some of her time to teach the \"little beggar decency.\" Mrs.\n      Bronckhorst, who loved the boy more than her own life, tried not to cry -- her\n      spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage. Lastly, Bronckhorst\n      used to say: -- \"There! That'll do, that'll do. For God's sake try to\n      behave like a rational woman. Go into the drawing-room.\" Mrs. Bronckhorst\n      would go, trying to carry it all off with a smile; and the guest of the\n      evening would feel angry and uncomfortable.",
                "After three years of this cheerful life -- for Mrs. Bronckhorst had no\n      woman-friends to talk to -- the Station was startled by the news that\n      Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT, against a\n      man called Biel, who certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs.\n      Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public. The utter want of reserve\n      with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to know that the\n      evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and native. There\n      were no letters; but Bronckhorst said openly that he would rack Heaven and\n      Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture of carpets in the\n      Central Jail. Mrs. Bronckhorst kept entirely to her house, and let\n      charitable folks say what they pleased. Opinions were divided. Some\n      two-thirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion that Biel was\n      guilty; but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by him. Biel was\n      furious and surprised. He denied the whole thing, and vowed that he would\n      thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life. No jury, we knew, could\n      convict a man on the criminal count on native evidence in a land where you\n      can buy a murder-charge, including the corpse, all complete for fifty-four\n      rupees; but Biel did not care to scrape through by the benefit of a doubt.\n      He wanted the whole thing cleared: but as he said one night: -- \"He can\n      prove anything with servants' evidence, and I've only my bare word.\" This\n      was about a month before the case came on; and beyond agreeing with Biel,\n      we could do little. All that we could be sure of was that the native\n      evidence would be bad enough to blast Biel's character for the rest of his\n      service; for when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly.\n      He does not boggle over details.",
                "Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked\n      over, said: -- \"Look here! I don't believe lawyers are any good. Get a\n      man to wire to Strickland, and beg him to come down and pull us through.\"",
                "Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line. He had not\n      long been married to Miss Youghal, but he scented in the telegram a chance\n      of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after, and next\n      night he came in and heard our story. He finished his pipe and said\n      oracularly: -- \"We must get at the evidence. Oorya bearer, Mussalman\n      khit and methraniayah, I suppose, are the pillars of the charge. I am on\n      in this piece; but I'm afraid I'm getting rusty in my talk.\"",
                "He rose and went into Biel's bedroom where his trunk had been put, and\n      shut the door. An hour later, we heard him say: -- \"I hadn't the heart\n      to part with my old makeups when I married. Will this do?\" There was a\n      lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway.",
                "\"Now lend me fifty rupees,\" said Strickland, \"and give me your Words of\n      Honor that you won't tell my Wife.\"",
                "He got all that he asked for, and left the house while the table drank his\n      health. What he did only he himself knows. A faquir hung about\n      Bronckhorst's compound for twelve days. Then a mehter appeared, and when\n      Biel heard of HIM, he said that Strickland was an angel full-fledged.\n      Whether the mehter made love to Janki, Mrs. Bronckhorst's ayah, is a\n      question which concerns Strickland exclusively.",
                "He came back at the end of three weeks, and said quietly: -- \"You spoke\n      the truth, Biel. The whole business is put up from beginning to end. Jove!\n      It almost astonishes ME! That Bronckhorst-beast isn't fit to live.\"",
                "There was uproar and shouting, and Biel said: -- \"How are you going to\n      prove it? You can't say that you've been trespassing on Bronckhorst's\n      compound in disguise!\"",
                "\"No,\" said Strickland. \"Tell your lawyer-fool, whoever he is, to get up\n      something strong about 'inherent improbabilities' and 'discrepancies of\n      evidence.' He won't have to speak, but it will make him happy. I'M going\n      to run this business.\"",
                "Biel held his tongue, and the other men waited to see what would happen.\n      They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men. When the case came off the\n      Court was crowded. Strickland hung about in the verandah of the Court,\n      till he met the Mohammedan khitmatgar. Then he murmured a faquir's\n      blessing in his ear, and asked him how his second wife did. The man spun\n      round, and, as he looked into the eyes of \"Estreeken Sahib,\" his jaw\n      dropped. You must remember that before Strickland was married, he was, as\n      I have told you already, a power among natives. Strickland whispered a\n      rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was abreast of all\n      that was going on, and went into the Court armed with a gut\n      trainer's-whip.",
                "The Mohammedan was the first witness and Strickland beamed upon him from\n      the back of the Court. The man moistened his lips with his tongue and, in\n      his abject fear of \"Estreeken Sahib\" the faquir, went back on every detail\n      of his evidence -- said he was a poor man and God was his witness that\n      he had forgotten every thing that Bronckhorst Sahib had told him to say.\n      Between his terror of Strickland, the Judge, and Bronckhorst he collapsed,\n      weeping.",
                "Then began the panic among the witnesses. Janki, the ayah, leering\n      chastely behind her veil, turned gray, and the bearer left the Court. He\n      said that his Mamma was dying and that it was not wholesome for any man to\n      lie unthriftily in the presence of \"Estreeken Sahib.\"",
                "Biel said politely to Bronckhorst: -- \"Your witnesses don't seem to\n      work. Haven't you any forged letters to produce?\" But Bronckhorst was\n      swaying to and fro in his chair, and there was a dead pause after Biel had\n      been called to order.",
                "Bronckhorst's Counsel saw the look on his client's face, and without more\n      ado, pitched his papers on the little green baize table, and mumbled\n      something about having been misinformed. The whole Court applauded wildly,\n      like soldiers at a theatre, and the Judge began to say what he\n      thought..........",
                "Biel came out of the place, and Strickland dropped a gut trainer's-whip in\n      the verandah. Ten minutes later, Biel was cutting Bronckhorst into ribbons\n      behind the old Court cells, quietly and without scandal. What was left of\n      Bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage; and his wife wept over it and\n      nursed it into a man again.",
                "Later on, after Biel had managed to hush up the counter-charge against\n      Bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence, Mrs. Bronckhorst, with her\n      faint watery smile, said that there had been a mistake, but it wasn't her\n      Teddy's fault altogether. She would wait till her Teddy came back to her.\n      Perhaps he had grown tired of her, or she had tried his patience, and\n      perhaps we wouldn't cut her any more, and perhaps the mothers would let\n      their children play with \"little Teddy\" again. He was so lonely. Then the\n      Station invited Mrs. Bronckhorst everywhere, until Bronckhorst was fit to\n      appear in public, when he went Home and took his wife with him. According\n      to the latest advices, her Teddy did \"come back to her,\" and they are\n      moderately happy. Though, of course, he can never forgive her the\n      thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him.. ........",
                "What Biel wants to know is: -- \"Why didn't I press home the charge\n      against the Bronckhorst-brute, and have him run in?\"",
                "What Mrs. Strickland wants to know is: -- \"How DID my husband bring\n      such a lovely, lovely Waler from your Station? I know ALL his\n      money-affairs; and I'm CERTAIN he didn't BUY it.\"",
                "\"What I want to know is: -- How do women like Mrs. Bronckhorst come to\n      marry men like Bronckhorst?\"",
                "And my conundrum is the most unanswerable of the three."

                "And the years went on as the years must do;\n    But our great Diana was always new -- \n    Fresh, and blooming, and blonde, and fair,\n    With azure eyes and with aureate hair;\n    And all the folk, as they came or went,\n    Offered her praise to her heart's content.\n                -- Diana of Ephesus.",
                "She had nothing to do with Number Eighteen in the Braccio Nuovo of the\n      Vatican, between Visconti's Ceres and the God of the Nile. She was purely\n      an Indian deity -- an Anglo-Indian deity, that is to say -- and we\n      called her THE Venus Annodomini, to distinguish her from other Annodominis\n      of the same everlasting order. There was a legend among the Hills that she\n      had once been young; but no living man was prepared to come forward and\n      say boldly that the legend was true.",
                "Men rode up to Simla, and stayed, and went away and made their name and\n      did their life's work, and returned again to find the Venus Annodomini\n      exactly as they had left her. She was as immutable as the Hills. But not\n      quite so green. All that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of riding,\n      walking, dancing, picnicking and over-exertion generally, the Venus\n      Annodomini did, and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of weariness.\n      Besides perpetual youth, she had discovered, men said, the secret of\n      perpetual health; and her fame spread about the land. From a mere woman,\n      she grew to be an Institution, insomuch that no young man could be said to\n      be properly formed, who had not, at some time or another, worshipped at\n      the shrine of the Venus Annodomini. There was no one like her, though\n      there were many imitations. Six years in her eyes were no more than six\n      months to ordinary women; and ten made less visible impression on her than\n      does a week's fever on an ordinary woman. Every one adored her, and in\n      return she was pleasant and courteous to nearly every one. Youth had been\n      a habit of hers for so long, that she could not part with it -- never\n      realized, in fact, the necessity of parting with it -- and took for her\n      more chosen associates young people.",
                "Among the worshippers of the Venus Annodomini was young Gayerson.",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson, he was called to distinguish him from his father\n      \"Young\" Gayerson, a Bengal Civilian, who affected the customs -- as he\n      had the heart -- of youth. \"Very Young\" Gayerson was not content to\n      worship placidly and for form's sake, as the other young men did, or to\n      accept a ride or a dance, or a talk from the Venus Annodomini in a\n      properly humble and thankful spirit. He was exacting, and, therefore, the\n      Venus Annodomini repressed him. He worried himself nearly sick in a futile\n      sort of way over her; and his devotion and earnestness made him appear\n      either shy or boisterous or rude, as his mood might vary, by the side of\n      the older men who, with him, bowed before the Venus Annodomini. She was\n      sorry for him. He reminded her of a lad who, three-and-twenty years ago,\n      had professed a boundless devotion for her, and for whom in return she had\n      felt something more than a week's weakness. But that lad had fallen away\n      and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped her;\n      and the Venus Annodomini had almost -- not quite -- forgotten his\n      name. \"Very Young\" Gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of\n      pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled. But the Venus\n      Annodomini checked him sternly none the less. Too much zeal was a thing\n      that she did not approve of; preferring instead, a tempered and sober\n      tenderness.",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson was miserable, and took no trouble to conceal his\n      wretchedness. He was in the Army -- a Line regiment I think, but am not\n      certain -- and, since his face was a looking-glass and his forehead an\n      open book, by reason of his innocence, his brothers in arms made his life\n      a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition. No one\n      except \"Very Young\" Gayerson, and he never told his views, knew how old\n      \"Very Young\" Gayerson believed the Venus Annodomini to be. Perhaps he\n      thought her five and twenty, or perhaps she told him that she was this\n      age. \"Very Young\" Gayerson would have forded the Gugger in flood to carry\n      her lightest word, and had implicit faith in her. Every one liked him, and\n      every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the Venus\n      Annodomini. Every one, too, admitted that it was not her fault; for the\n      Venus Annodomini differed from Mrs. Hauksbee and Mrs. Reiver in this\n      particular -- she never moved a finger to attract any one; but, like\n      Ninon de l'Enclos, all men were attracted to her. One could admire and\n      respect Mrs. Hauksbee, despise and avoid Mrs. Reiver, but one was forced\n      to adore the Venus Annodomini.",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson's papa held a Division or a Collectorate or\n      something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of Bengal -- full\n      of Babus who edited newspapers proving that \"Young\" Gayerson was a \"Nero\"\n       and a \"Scylla\" and a \"Charybdis\"; and, in addition to the Babus, there was\n      a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad for nine months of the year.\n      \"Young\" Gayerson -- he was about five and forty -- rather liked\n      Babus, they amused him, but he objects to dysentery, and when he could get\n      away, went to Darjiling for the most part. This particular season he\n      fancied that he would come up to Simla, and see his boy. The boy was not\n      altogether pleased. He told the Venus Annodomini that his father was\n      coming up, and she flushed a little and said that she should be delighted\n      to make his acquaintance. Then she looked long and thoughtfully at \"Very\n      Young\" Gayerson; because she was very, very sorry for him, and he was a\n      very, very big idiot.",
                "\"My daughter is coming out in a fortnight, Mr. Gayerson,\" she said.",
                "\"Your WHAT?\" said he.",
                "\"Daughter,\" said the Venus Annodomini. \"She's been out for a year at Home\n      already, and I want her to see a little of India. She is nineteen and a\n      very sensible, nice girl I believe.\"",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson, who was a short twenty-two years old, nearly fell\nout of his chair with astonishment; for he had persisted in believing,\nagainst all belief, in the youth of the Venus Annodomini.\n\n She, with her back to the curtained window, watched the effect of her\nsentences and smiled.",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson's papa came up twelve days later, and had not been\n      in Simla four and twenty hours, before two men, old acquaintances of his,\n      had told him how \"Very Young\" Gayerson had been conducting himself.",
                "\"Young\" Gayerson laughed a good deal, and inquired who the Venus\n      Annodomini might be. Which proves that he had been living in Bengal where\n      nobody knows anything except the rate of Exchange. Then he said \"boys will\n      be boys,\" and spoke to his son about the matter.",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy; and \"Young\"\n       Gayerson said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool into the\n      world. He suggested that his son had better cut his leave short and go\n      down to his duties. This led to an unfilial answer, and relations were\n      strained, until \"Young\" Gayerson demanded that they should call on the\n      Venus Annodomini. \"Very Young\" Gayerson went with his papa, feeling,\n      somehow, uncomfortable and small.",
                "The Venus Annodomini received them graciously and \"Young\" Gayerson said: -- \"By\n      Jove! It's Kitty!\" \"Very Young\" Gayerson would have listened for an\n      explanation, if his time had not been taken up with trying to talk to a\n      large, handsome, quiet, well-dressed girl -- introduced to him by the\n      Venus Annodomini as her daughter. She was far older in manners, style and\n      repose than \"Very Young\" Gayerson; and, as he realized this thing, he felt\n      sick.",
                "Presently, he heard the Venus Annodomini saying: -- \"Do you know that\n      your son is one of my most devoted admirers?\"",
                "\"I don't wonder,\" said \"Young\" Gayerson. Here he raised his voice: -- \"He\n      follows his father's footsteps. Didn't I worship the ground you trod on,\n      ever so long ago, Kitty -- and you haven't changed since then. How\n      strange it all seems!\"",
                "\"Very Young\" Gayerson said nothing. His conversation with the daughter of\n      the Venus Annodomini was, through the rest of the call, fragmentary and\n      disjointed..........",
                "\"At five, tomorrow then,\" said the Venus Annodomini. \"And mind you are\n      punctual.\"",
                "\"At five punctual,\" said \"Young\" Gayerson. \"You can lend your old father a\n      horse I dare say, youngster, can't you? I'm going for a ride tomorrow\n      afternoon.\"",
                "\"Certainly,\" said \"Very Young\" Gayerson. \"I am going down tomorrow\n      morning. My ponies are at your service, Sir.\"",
                "The Venus Annodomini looked at him across the half-light of the room, and\n      her big gray eyes filled with moisture. She rose and shook hands with him.",
                "\"Goodbye, Tom,\" whispered the Venus Annodomini."

                "Some natives say that it came from the other side of Kulu, where the\n      eleven-inch Temple Sapphire is. Others that it was made at the\n      Devil-Shrine of Ao-Chung in Thibet, was stolen by a Kafir, from him by a\n      Gurkha, from him again by a Lahouli, from him by a khitmatgar, and by this\n      latter sold to an Englishman, so all its virtue was lost: because, to work\n      properly, the Bisara of Pooree must be stolen -- with bloodshed if\n      possible, but, at any rate, stolen.",
                "These stories of the coming into India are all false. It was made at\n      Pooree ages since -- the manner of its making would fill a small book -- was\n      stolen by one of the Temple dancing-girls there, for her own purposes, and\n      then passed on from hand to hand, steadily northward, till it reached\n      Hanla: always bearing the same name -- the Bisara of Pooree. In shape\n      it is a tiny, square box of silver, studded outside with eight small\n      balas-rubies. Inside the box, which opens with a spring, is a little\n      eyeless fish, carved from some sort of dark, shiny nut and wrapped in a\n      shred of faded gold-cloth. That is the Bisara of Pooree, and it were\n      better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to touch the Bisara\n      of Pooree.",

It is the only regularly working, trustworthy love-charm\n      in the country, with one exception.",
                "[The other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the Nizam's Horse, at a\n      place called Tuprani, due north of Hyderabad.] This can be depended upon\n      for a fact. Some one else may explain it.",
                "If the Bisara be not stolen, but given or bought or found, it turns\n      against its owner in three years, and leads to ruin or death. This is\n      another fact which you may explain when you have time.",
                "Meanwhile, you can laugh at it. At present, the Bisara is safe on an\n      ekka-pony's neck, inside the blue bead-necklace that keeps off the\n      Evil-eye. If the ekka-driver ever finds it, and wears it, or gives it to\n      his wife, I am sorry for him.",
                "A very dirty hill-cooly woman, with goitre, owned it at Theog in 1884. It\n      came into Simla from the north before Churton's khitmatgar bought it, and\n      sold it, for three times its silver-value, to Churton, who collected\n      curiosities. The servant knew no more what he had bought than the master;\n      but a man looking over Churton's collection of curiosities -- Churton\n      was an Assistant Commissioner by the way -- saw and held his tongue. He\n      was an Englishman; but knew how to believe. Which shows that he was\n      different from most Englishmen. He knew that it was dangerous to have any\n      share in the little box when working or dormant; for unsought Love is a\n      terrible gift.",
                "Pack -- \"Grubby\" Pack, as we used to call him -- was, in every way,\n      a nasty little man who must have crawled into the Army by mistake. He was\n      three inches taller than his sword, but not half so strong. And the sword\n      was a fifty-shilling, tailor-made one. Nobody liked him, and, I suppose,\n      it was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly\n      in love with Miss Hollis, who was good and sweet, and five foot seven in\n      her tennis shoes. He was not content with falling in love quietly, but\n      brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the business.\n      If he had not been so objectionable, one might have pitied him. He\n      vapored, and fretted, and fumed, and trotted up and down, and tried to\n      make himself pleasing in Miss Hollis's big, quiet, gray eyes, and failed.\n      It was one of the cases that you sometimes meet, even in this country\n      where we marry by Code, of a really blind attachment all on one side,\n      without the faintest possibility of return. Miss Hollis looked on Pack as\n      some sort of vermin running about the road. He had no prospects beyond\n      Captain's pay, and no wits to help that out by one anna. In a large-sized\n      man, love like his would have been touching.",
                "In a good man it would have been grand. He being what he was, it was only\n      a nuisance.",
                "You will believe this much. What you will not believe, is what follows:\n      Churton, and The Man who Knew that the Bisara was, were lunching at the\n      Simla Club together. Churton was complaining of life in general. His best\n      mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her back; his\n      decisions were being reversed by the upper Courts, more than an Assistant\n      Commissioner of eight years' standing has a right to expect; he knew liver\n      and fever, and, for weeks past, had felt out of sorts. Altogether, he was\n      disgusted and disheartened.",
                "Simla Club dining-room is built, as all the world knows, in two sections,\n      with an arch-arrangement dividing them. Come in, turn to your own left,\n      take the table under the window, and you cannot see any one who has come\n      in, turning to the right, and taken a table on the right side of the arch.\n      Curiously enough, every word that you say can be heard, not only by the\n      other diner, but by the servants beyond the screen through which they\n      bring dinner. This is worth knowing: an echoing-room is a trap to be\n      forewarned against.",
                "Half in fun, and half hoping to be believed, The Man who Knew told Churton\n      the story of the Bisara of Pooree at rather greater length than I have\n      told it to you in this place; winding up with the suggestion that Churton\n      might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether all his\n      troubles would go with it. In ordinary ears, English ears, the tale was\n      only an interesting bit of folk-lore. Churton laughed, said that he felt\n      better for his tiffin, and went out. Pack had been tiffining by himself to\n      the right of the arch, and had heard everything. He was nearly mad with\n      his absurd infatuation for Miss Hollis that all Simla had been laughing\n      about.",
                "It is a curious thing that, when a man hates or loves beyond reason, he is\n      ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings. Which he would not do\n      for money or power merely. Depend upon it, Solomon would never have built\n      altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names, if there had\n      not been trouble of some kind in his zenana, and nowhere else. But this is\n      beside the story. The facts of the case are these: Pack called on Churton\n      next day when Churton was out, left his card, and STOLE the Bisara of\n      Pooree from its place under the clock on the mantelpiece! Stole it like\n      the thief he was by nature. Three days later, all Simla was electrified by\n      the news that Miss Hollis had accepted Pack -- the shrivelled rat,\n      Pack! Do you desire clearer evidence than this? The Bisara of Pooree had\n      been stolen, and it worked as it had always done when won by foul means.",

                "The Man who Knew felt that he WAS justified; but believing and acting on a\n      belief are quite different things. The insolent satisfaction of Pack as he\n      ambled by the side of Miss Hollis, and Churton's striking release from\n      liver, as soon as the Bisara of Pooree had gone, decided the Man. He\n      explained to Churton and Churton laughed, because he was not brought up to\n      believe that men on the Government House List steal -- at least little\n      things. But the miraculous acceptance by Miss Hollis of that tailor, Pack,\n      decided him to take steps on suspicion. He vowed that he only wanted to\n      find out where his ruby-studded silver box had vanished to. You cannot\n      accuse a man on the Government House List of stealing. And if you rifle\n      his room you are a thief yourself. Churton, prompted by The Man who Knew,\n      decided on burglary. If he found nothing in Pack's room.... but it is not\n      nice to think of what would have happened in that case.",
                "Pack went to a dance at Benmore -- Benmore WAS Benmore in those days,\n      and not an office -- and danced fifteen waltzes out of twenty-two with\n      Miss Hollis. Churton and The Man took all the keys that they could lay\n      hands on, and went to Pack's room in the hotel, certain that his servants\n      would be away. Pack was a cheap soul. He had not purchased a decent\n      cash-box to keep his papers in, but one of those native imitations that\n      you buy for ten rupees. It opened to any sort of key, and there at the\n      bottom, under Pack's Insurance Policy, lay the Bisara of Pooree!",
                "Churton called Pack names, put the Bisara of Pooree in his pocket, and\n      went to the dance with The Man. At least, he came in time for supper, and\n      saw the beginning of the end in Miss Hollis's eyes. She was hysterical\n      after supper, and was taken away by her Mamma.",
                "At the dance, with the abominable Bisara in his pocket, Churton twisted\n      his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old Rink, and had to be\n      sent home in a rickshaw, grumbling. He did not believe in the Bisara of\n      Pooree any the more for this manifestation, but he sought out Pack and\n      called him some ugly names; and \"thief\" was the mildest of them. Pack took\n      the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both soul and\n      body to resent an insult, and went his way. There was no public scandal.",
                "A week later, Pack got his definite dismissal from Miss Hollis.",
                "There had been a mistake in the placing of her affections, she said.",
                "So he went away to Madras, where he can do no great harm even if he lives\n      to be a Colonel.",
                "Churton insisted upon The Man who Knew taking the Bisara of Pooree as a\n      gift. The Man took it, went down to the Cart Road at once, found an ekka\n      pony with a blue head-necklace, fastened the Bisara of Pooree inside the\n      necklace with a piece of shoe-string and thanked Heaven that he was rid of\n      a danger. Remember, in case you ever find it, that you must not destroy\n      the Bisara of Pooree. I have not time to explain why just now, but the\n      power lies in the little wooden fish. Mister Gubernatis or Max Muller\n      could tell you more about it than I.",
                "You will say that all this story is made up. Very well. If ever you come\n      across a little silver, ruby-studded box, seven-eighths of an inch long by\n      three-quarters wide, with a dark-brown wooden fish, wrapped in gold cloth,\n      inside it, keep it. Keep it for three years, and then you will discover\n      for yourself whether my story is true or false.",
                "Better still, steal it as Pack did, and you will be sorry that you had not\n      killed yourself in the beginning."

                "This is no work of mine. My friend, Gabral Misquitta, the half-caste,\n      spoke it all, between moonset and morning, six weeks before he died; and I\n      took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so: --",
                "It lies between the Copper-smith's Gully and the pipe-stem sellers'\n      quarter, within a hundred yards, too, as the crow flies, of the Mosque of\n      Wazir Khan. I don't mind telling any one this much, but I defy him to find\n      the Gate, however well he may think he knows the City. You might even go\n      through the very gully it stands in a hundred times, and be none the\n      wiser. We used to call the gully, \"the Gully of the Black Smoke,\" but its\n      native name is altogether different of course. A loaded donkey couldn't\n      pass between the walls; and, at one point, just before you reach the Gate,\n      a bulged house-front makes people go along all sideways.",
                "It isn't really a gate though. It's a house. Old Fung-Tching had it first\n      five years ago. He was a boot-maker in Calcutta. They say that he murdered\n      his wife there when he was drunk. That was why he dropped bazar-rum and\n      took to the Black Smoke instead. Later on, he came up north and opened the\n      Gate as a house where you could get your smoke in peace and quiet. Mind\n      you, it was a pukka, respectable opium-house, and not one of those\n      stifling, sweltering chandoo-khanas, that you can find all over the City.\n      No; the old man knew his business thoroughly, and he was most clean for a\n      Chinaman. He was a one-eyed little chap, not much more than five feet\n      high, and both his middle fingers were gone. All the same, he was the\n      handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen. Never seemed to be\n      touched by the Smoke, either; and what he took day and night, night and\n      day, was a caution. I've been at it five years, and I can do my fair share\n      of the Smoke with any one; but I was a child to Fung-Tching that way. All\n      the same, the old man was keen on his money, very keen; and that's what I\n      can't understand. I heard he saved a good deal before he died, but his\n      nephew has got all that now; and the old man's gone back to China to be\n      buried.",
                "He kept the big upper room, where his best customers gathered, as neat as\n      a new pin. In one corner used to stand Fung-Tching's Joss -- almost as\n      ugly as Fung-Tching -- and there were always sticks burning under his\n      nose; but you never smelt 'em when the pipes were going thick. Opposite\n      the Joss was Fung-Tching's coffin. He had spent a good deal of his savings\n      on that, and whenever a new man came to the Gate he was always introduced\n      to it. It was lacquered black, with red and gold writings on it, and I've\n      heard that Fung-Tching brought it out all the way from China. I don't know\n      whether that's true or not, but I know that, if I came first in the\n      evening, I used to spread my mat just at the foot of it. It was a quiet\n      corner you see, and a sort of breeze from the gully came in at the window\n      now and then. Besides the mats, there was no other furniture in the room -- only\n      the coffin, and the old Joss all green and blue and purple with age and\n      polish.",
                "Fung-Tching never told us why he called the place \"The Gate of a Hundred\n      Sorrows.\" (He was the only Chinaman I know who used bad-sounding fancy\n      names. Most of them are flowery. As you'll see in Calcutta.) We used to\n      find that out for ourselves. Nothing grows on you so much, if you're\n      white, as the Black Smoke. A yellow man is made different. Opium doesn't\n      tell on him scarcely at all; but white and black suffer a good deal. Of\n      course, there are some people that the Smoke doesn't touch any more than\n      tobacco would at first. They just doze a bit, as one would fall asleep\n      naturally, and next morning they are almost fit for work. Now, I was one\n      of that sort when I began, but I've been at it for five years pretty\n      steadily, and its different now. There was an old aunt of mine, down Agra\n      way, and she left me a little at her death. About sixty rupees a month\n      secured. Sixty isn't much. I can recollect a time, seems hundreds and\n      hundreds of years ago, that I was getting my three hundred a month, and\n      pickings, when I was working on a big timber contract in Calcutta.",
                "I didn't stick to that work for long. The Black Smoke does not allow of\n      much other business; and even though I am very little affected by it, as\n      men go, I couldn't do a day's work now to save my life. After all, sixty\n      rupees is what I want. When old Fung-Tching was alive he used to draw the\n      money for me, give me about half of it to live on (I eat very little), and\n      the rest he kept himself. I was free of the Gate at any time of the day\n      and night, and could smoke and sleep there when I liked, so I didn't care.\n      I know the old man made a good thing out of it; but that's no matter.\n      Nothing matters, much to me; and, besides, the money always came fresh and\n      fresh each month.",
                "There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened. Me,\n      and two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli, but they\n      got the sack and couldn't pay (no man who has to work in the daylight can\n      do the Black Smoke for any length of time straight on); a Chinaman that\n      was Fung-Tching's nephew; a bazar-woman that had got a lot of money\n      somehow; an English loafer -- Mac-Somebody I think, but I have\n      forgotten -- that smoked heaps, but never seemed to pay anything (they\n      said he had saved Fung-Tching's life at some trial in Calcutta when he was\n      a barrister): another Eurasian, like myself, from Madras; a half-caste\n      woman, and a couple of men who said they had come from the North. I think\n      they must have been Persians or Afghans or something. There are not more\n      than five of us living now, but we come regular. I don't know what\n      happened to the Baboos; but the bazar-woman she died after six months of\n      the Gate, and I think Fung-Tching took her bangles and nose-ring for\n      himself. But I'm not certain. The Englishman, he drank as well as smoked,\n      and he dropped off. One of the Persians got killed in a row at night by\n      the big well near the mosque a long time ago, and the Police shut up the\n      well, because they said it was full of foul air.",
                "They found him dead at the bottom of it. So, you see, there is only me,\n      the Chinaman, the half-caste woman that we call the Memsahib (she used to\n      live with Fung-Tching), the other Eurasian, and one of the Persians. The\n      Memsahib looks very old now. I think she was a young woman when the Gate\n      was opened; but we are all old for the matter of that. Hundreds and\n      hundreds of years old. It is very hard to keep count of time in the Gate,\n      and besides, time doesn't matter to me. I draw my sixty rupees fresh and\n      fresh every month.",
                "A very, very long while ago, when I used to be getting three hundred and\n      fifty rupees a month, and pickings, on a big timber-contract at Calcutta,\n      I had a wife of sorts. But she's dead now. People said that I killed her\n      by taking to the Black Smoke. Perhaps I did, but it's so long since it\n      doesn't matter. Sometimes when I first came to the Gate, I used to feel\n      sorry for it; but that's all over and done with long ago, and I draw my\n      sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month, and am quite happy. Not DRUNK\n      happy, you know, but always quiet and soothed and contented.",
                "How did I take to it? It began at Calcutta. I used to try it in my own\n      house, just to see what it was like. I never went very far, but I think my\n      wife must have died then. Anyhow, I found myself here, and got to know\n      Fung-Tching. I don't remember rightly how that came about; but he told me\n      of the Gate and I used to go there, and, somehow, I have never got away\n      from it since. Mind you, though, the Gate was a respectable place in\n      Fung-Tching's time where you could be comfortable, and not at all like the\n      chandoo-khanas where the niggers go. No; it was clean and quiet, and not\n      crowded. Of course, there were others beside us ten and the man; but we\n      always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen head-piece, all covered with\n      black and red dragons and things; just like a coffin in the corner.",
                "At the end of one's third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight.\n      I've watched 'em, many and many a night through. I used to regulate my\n      Smoke that way, and now it takes a dozen pipes to make 'em stir. Besides,\n      they are all torn and dirty, like the mats, and old Fung-Tching is dead.\n      He died a couple of years ago, and gave me the pipe I always use now -- a\n      silver one, with queer beasts crawling up and down the receiver-bottle\n      below the cup. Before that, I think, I used a big bamboo stem with a\n      copper cup, a very small one, and a green jade mouthpiece. It was a little\n      thicker than a walking-stick stem, and smoked sweet, very sweet. The\n      bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke. Silver doesn't, and I've got to clean\n      it out now and then, that's a great deal of trouble, but I smoke it for\n      the old man's sake. He must have made a good thing out of me, but he\n      always gave me clean mats and pillows, and the best stuff you could get\n      anywhere.",
                "When he died, his nephew Tsin-ling took up the Gate, and he called it the\n      \"Temple of the Three Possessions;\" but we old ones speak of it as the\n      \"Hundred Sorrows,\" all the same. The nephew does things very shabbily, and\n      I think the Memsahib must help him. She lives with him; same as she used\n      to do with the old man. The two let in all sorts of low people, niggers\n      and all, and the Black Smoke isn't as good as it used to be. I've found\n      burnt bran in my pipe over and over again. The old man would have died if\n      that had happened in his time. Besides, the room is never cleaned, and all\n      the mats are torn and cut at the edges. The coffin has gone -- gone to\n      China again -- with the old man and two ounces of smoke inside it, in\n      case he should want 'em on the way.",
                "The Joss doesn't get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to;\n      that's a sign of ill-luck, as sure as Death. He's all brown, too, and no\n      one ever attends to him. That's the Memsahib's work, I know; because, when\n      Tsin-ling tried to burn gilt paper before him, she said it was a waste of\n      money, and, if he kept a stick burning very slowly, the Joss wouldn't know\n      the difference. So now we've got the sticks mixed with a lot of glue, and\n      they take half-an-hour longer to burn, and smell stinky. Let alone the\n      smell of the room by itself. No business can get on if they try that sort\n      of thing.",
                "The Joss doesn't like it. I can see that. Late at night, sometimes, he\n      turns all sorts of queer colors -- blue and green and red -- just as\n      he used to do when old Fung-Tching was alive; and he rolls his eyes and\n      stamps his feet like a devil.",
                "I don't know why I don't leave the place and smoke quietly in a little\n      room of my own in the bazar. Most like, Tsin-ling would kill me if I went\n      away -- he draws my sixty rupees now -- and besides, it's so much\n      trouble, and I've grown to be very fond of the Gate. It's not much to look\n      at. Not what it was in the old man's time, but I couldn't leave it. I've\n      seen so many come in and out. And I've seen so many die here on the mats\n      that I should be afraid of dying in the open now. I've seen some things\n      that people would call strange enough; but nothing is strange when you're\n      on the Black Smoke, except the Black Smoke. And if it was, it wouldn't\n      matter.",
                "Fung-Tching used to be very particular about his people, and never got in\n      any one who'd give trouble by dying messy and such. But the nephew isn't\n      half so careful. He tells everywhere that he keeps a \"first-chop\" house.\n      Never tries to get men in quietly, and make them comfortable like\n      Fung-Tching did. That's why the Gate is getting a little bit more known\n      than it used to be. Among the niggers of course. The nephew daren't get a\n      white, or, for matter of that, a mixed skin into the place. He has to keep\n      us three of course -- me and the Memsahib and the other Eurasian. We're\n      fixtures.",
                "But he wouldn't give us credit for a pipeful -- not for anything.",
                "One of these days, I hope, I shall die in the Gate. The Persian and the\n      Madras man are terrible shaky now. They've got a boy to light their pipes\n      for them. I always do that myself. Most like, I shall see them carried out\n      before me. I don't think I shall ever outlive the Memsahib or Tsin-ling.\n      Women last longer than men at the Black-Smoke, and Tsin-ling has a deal of\n      the old man's blood in him, though he DOES smoke cheap stuff. The\n      bazar-woman knew when she was going two days before her time; and SHE died\n      on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow, and the old man hung up her\n      pipe just above the Joss. He was always fond of her, I fancy. But he took\n      her bangles just the same.",
                "I should like to die like the bazar-woman -- on a clean, cool mat with\n      a pipe of good stuff between my lips. When I feel I'm going, I shall ask\n      Tsin-ling for them, and he can draw my sixty rupees a month, fresh and\n      fresh, as long as he pleases, and watch the black and red dragons have\n      their last big fight together; and then....",
                "Well, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters much to me -- only I wished\n      Tsin-ling wouldn't put bran into the Black Smoke."

                "The polo-ball was an old one, scarred, chipped, and dinted. It stood on\n      the mantelpiece among the pipe-stems which Imam Din, khitmatgar, was\n      cleaning for me.",
                "\"Does the Heaven-born want this ball?\" said Imam Din, deferentially.",
                "The Heaven-born set no particular store by it; but of what use was a\n      polo-ball to a khitmatgar?",
                "\"By Your Honor's favor, I have a little son. He has seen this ball, and\n      desires it to play with. I do not want it for myself.\"",
                "No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting to play\n      with polo-balls. He carried out the battered thing into the verandah; and\n      there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks, a patter of small feet, and\n      the thud-thud-thud of the ball rolling along the ground. Evidently the\n      little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure. But\n      how had he managed to see that polo-ball?",
                "Next day, coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual, I was\n      aware of a small figure in the dining-room -- a tiny, plump figure in a\n      ridiculously inadequate shirt which came, perhaps, half-way down the tubby\n      stomach. It wandered round the room, thumb in mouth, crooning to itself as\n      it took stock of the pictures. Undoubtedly this was the \"little son.\"",
                "He had no business in my room, of course; but was so deeply absorbed in\n      his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway. I stepped into\n      the room and startled him nearly into a fit. He sat down on the ground\n      with a gasp. His eyes opened, and his mouth followed suit. I knew what was\n      coming, and fled, followed by a long, dry howl which reached the servants'\n      quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done. In ten\n      seconds Imam Din was in the dining-room. Then despairing sobs arose, and I\n      returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner who was using most\n      of his shirt as a handkerchief.",
                "\"This boy,\" said Imam Din, judicially, \"is a budmash, a big budmash. He\n      will, without doubt, go to the jail-khana for his behavior.\" Renewed yells\n      from the penitent, and an elaborate apology to myself from Imam Din.",
                "\"Tell the baby,\" said I, \"that the Sahib is not angry, and take him away.\"\n       Imam Din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender, who had now gathered all\n      his shirt round his neck, string-wise, and the yell subsided into a sob.\n      The two set off for the door. \"His name,\" said Imam Din, as though the\n      name were part of the crime, \"is Muhammad Din, and he is a budmash.\" Freed\n      from present danger, Muhammad Din turned round, in his father's arms, and\n      said gravely: -- \"It is true that my name is Muhammad Din, Tahib, but I\n      am not a budmash. I am a MAN!\"",
                "From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din. Never again did he\n      come into my dining-room, but on the neutral ground of the compound, we\n      greeted each other with much state, though our conversation was confined\n      to \"Talaam, Tahib\" from his side and \"Salaam Muhammad Din\" from mine.\n      Daily on my return from office, the little white shirt, and the fat little\n      body used to rise from the shade of the creeper-covered trellis where they\n      had been hid; and daily I checked my horse here, that my salutation might\n      not be slurred over or given unseemly.",
                "Muhammad Din never had any companions. He used to trot about the compound,\n      in and out of the castor-oil bushes, on mysterious errands of his own. One\n      day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the ground. He had half\n      buried the polo-ball in dust, and stuck six shrivelled old marigold\n      flowers in a circle round it. Outside that circle again, was a rude\n      square, traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of\n      broken china; the whole bounded by a little bank of dust. The bhistie from\n      the well-curb put in a plea for the small architect, saying that it was\n      only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden.",
                "Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the child's work then or\n      later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me unawares\n      full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads, dust-bank,\n      and fragments of broken soap-dish into confusion past all hope of mending.\n      Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the\n      ruin I had wrought.",
                "Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for\n      spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the\n      while. Muhammad Din labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the\n      dust-bank and pottery fragments, and it was with a tearful apologetic face\n      that he said, \"Talaam Tahib,\" when I came home from the office. A hasty\n      inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that by my singular\n      favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased. Whereat the child\n      took heart and fell to tracing the ground-plan of an edifice which was to\n      eclipse the marigold-polo-ball creation.",
                "For some months, the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble\n      orbit among the castor-oil bushes and in the dust; always fashioning\n      magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer, smooth\n      water-worn pebbles, bits of broken glass, and feathers pulled, I fancy,\n      from my fowls -- always alone and always crooning to himself.",
                "A gayly-spotted sea-shell was dropped one day close to the last of his\n      little buildings; and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something\n      more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it. Nor was I\n      disappointed. He meditated for the better part of an hour, and his\n      crooning rose to a jubilant song. Then he began tracing in dust. It would\n      certainly be a wondrous palace, this one, for it was two yards long and a\n      yard broad in ground-plan. But the palace was never completed.",
                "Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriage-drive, and\n      no \"Talaam Tahib\" to welcome my return. I had grown accustomed to the\n      greeting, and its omission troubled me. Next day, Imam Din told me that\n      the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine. He got the\n      medicine, and an English Doctor.",
                "\"They have no stamina, these brats,\" said the Doctor, as he left Imam\n      Din's quarters.",
                "A week later, though I would have given much to have avoided it, I met on\n      the road to the Mussulman burying-ground Imam Din, accompanied by one\n      other friend, carrying in his arms, wrapped in a white cloth, all that was\n      left of little Muhammad Din."

It brought him\n      happily through the Simla season. Hannasyde was not lovely. There was a\n      crudity in his manners, and a roughness in the way in which he helped a\n      lady on to her horse, that did not attract the other sex to him. Even if\n      he had cast about for their favor, which he did not. He kept his wounded\n      heart all to himself for a while.",
                "Then trouble came to him. All who go to Simla, know the slope from the\n      Telegraph to the Public Works Office. Hannasyde was loafing up the hill,\n      one September morning between calling hours, when a 'rickshaw came down in\n      a hurry, and in the 'rickshaw sat the living, breathing image of the girl\n      who had made him so happily unhappy.",
                "Hannasyde leaned against the railing and gasped. He wanted to run downhill\n      after the 'rickshaw, but that was impossible; so he went forward with most\n      of his blood in his temples. It was impossible, for many reasons, that the\n      woman in the 'rickshaw could be the girl he had known. She was, he\n      discovered later, the wife of a man from Dindigul, or Coimbatore, or some\n      out-of-the-way place, and she had come up to Simla early in the season for\n      the good of her health.",
                "She was going back to Dindigul, or wherever it was, at the end of the\n      season; and in all likelihood would never return to Simla again, her\n      proper Hill-station being Ootacamund. That night, Hannasyde, raw and\n      savage from the raking up of all old feelings, took counsel with himself\n      for one measured hour. What he decided upon was this; and you must decide\n      for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love, and how much a\n      very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself, affected the\n      decision. Mrs. Landys-Haggert would never in all human likelihood cross\n      his path again. So whatever he did didn't much matter. She was\n      marvellously like the girl who \"took a deep interest\" and the rest of the\n      formula. All things considered, it would be pleasant to make the\n      acquaintance of Mrs. Landys-Haggert, and for a little time -- only a\n      very little time -- to make believe that he was with Alice Chisane\n      again. Every one is more or less mad on one point. Hannasyde's particular\n      monomania was his old love, Alice Chisane.",
                "He made it his business to get introduced to Mrs. Haggert, and the\n      introduction prospered. He also made it his business to see as much as he\n      could of that lady. When a man is in earnest as to interviews, the\n      facilities which Simla offers are startling. There are garden-parties, and\n      tennis-parties, and picnics, and luncheons at Annandale, and\n      rifle-matches, and dinners and balls; besides rides and walks, which are\n      matters of private arrangement.",
                "Hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness, and he\n      ended by doing much more. He wanted to be deceived, he meant to be\n      deceived, and he deceived himself very thoroughly. Not only were the face\n      and figure, the face and figure of Alice Chisane, but the voice and lower\n      tones were exactly the same, and so were the turns of speech; and the\n      little mannerisms, that every woman has, of gait and gesticulation, were\n      absolutely and identically the same. The turn of the head was the same;\n      the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same; the\n      sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same;\n      and once, most marvellous of all, Mrs. Landys-Haggert singing to herself\n      in the next room, while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride,\n      hummed, note for note, with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second\n      line: -- \"Poor Wandering One!\" exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed it\n      for Hannasyde in the dusk of an English drawing-room. In the actual woman\n      herself -- in the soul of her -- there was not the least likeness;\n      she and Alice Chisane being cast in different moulds. But all that\n      Hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about, was this maddening and\n      perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner. He was bent on making a\n      fool of himself that way; and he was in no sort disappointed.",
                "Open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to any\n      sort of woman; but Mrs. Landys-Haggert, being a woman of the world, could\n      make nothing of Hannasyde's admiration.",
                "He would take any amount of trouble -- he was a selfish man habitually -- to\n      meet and forestall, if possible, her wishes.",
                "Anything she told him to do was law; and he was, there could be no\n      doubting it, fond of her company so long as she talked to him, and kept on\n      talking about trivialities. But when she launched into expression of her\n      personal views and her wrongs, those small social differences that make\n      the spice of Simla life, Hannasyde was neither pleased nor interested. He\n      didn't want to know anything about Mrs. Landys-Haggert, or her experiences\n      in the past -- she had travelled nearly all over the world, and could\n      talk cleverly -- he wanted the likeness of Alice Chisane before his\n      eyes and her voice in his ears.",
                "Anything outside that, reminding him of another personality jarred, and he\n      showed that it did.",
                "Under the new Post Office, one evening, Mrs. Landys-Haggert turned on him,\n      and spoke her mind shortly and without warning. \"Mr. Hannasyde,\" said she,\n      \"will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed yourself my\n      special cavalier servente? I don't understand it. But I am perfectly\n      certain, somehow or other, that you don't care the least little bit in the\n      world for ME.\" This seems to support, by the way, the theory that no man\n      can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out. Hannasyde was\n      taken off his guard. His defence never was a strong one, because he was\n      always thinking of himself, and he blurted out, before he knew what he was\n      saying, this inexpedient answer: -- \"No more I do.\"",
                "The queerness of the situation and the reply, made Mrs. Haggert laugh.\n      Then it all came out; and at the end of Hannasyde's lucid explanation,\n      Mrs. Haggert said, with the least little touch of scorn in her voice: -- \"So\n      I'm to act as the lay-figure for you to hang the rags of your tattered\n      affections on, am I?\"",
                "Hannasyde didn't see what answer was required, and he devoted himself\n      generally and vaguely to the praise of Alice Chisane, which was\n      unsatisfactory. Now it is to be thoroughly made clear that Mrs. Haggert\n      had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in Hannasyde.",
                "Only -- only no woman likes being made love through instead of to -- specially\n      on behalf of a musty divinity of four years' standing.",
                "Hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition of\n      himself. He was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of\n      Simla.",
                "When the season ended, Hannasyde went down to his own place and Mrs.\n      Haggert to hers. \"It was like making love to a ghost,\" said Hannasyde to\n      himself, \"and it doesn't matter; and now I'll get to my work.\" But he\n      found himself thinking steadily of the Haggert-Chisane ghost; and he could\n      not be certain whether it was Haggert or Chisane that made up the greater\n      part of the pretty phantom..........",
                "He got understanding a month later.",
                "A peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a heartless\n      Government transfers men from one end of the Empire to the other. You can\n      never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till he or she dies.\n      There was a case once -- but that's another story.",
                "Haggert's Department ordered him up from Dindigul to the Frontier at two\n      days' notice, and he went through, losing money at every step, from\n      Dindigul to his station. He dropped Mrs. Haggert at Lucknow, to stay with\n      some friends there, to take part in a big ball at the Chutter Munzil, and\n      to come on when he had made the new home a little comfortable. Lucknow was\n      Hannasyde's station, and Mrs. Haggert stayed a week there. Hannasyde went\n      to meet her. And the train came in, he discovered which he had been\n      thinking of for the past month. The unwisdom of his conduct also struck\n      him. The Lucknow week, with two dances, and an unlimited quantity of rides\n      together, clinched matters; and Hannasyde found himself pacing this circle\n      of thought: -- He adored Alice Chisane -- at least he HAD adored\n      her. AND he admired Mrs. Landys-Haggert because she was like Alice\n      Chisane. BUT Mrs. Landys-Haggert was not in the least like Alice Chisane,\n      being a thousand times more adorable. NOW Alice Chisane was \"the bride of\n      another,\" and so was Mrs. Landys-Haggert, and a good and honest wife too.\n      THEREFORE, he, Hannasyde, was.... here he called himself several hard\n      names, and wished that he had been wise in the beginning.",
                "Whether Mrs. Landys-Haggert saw what was going on in his mind, she alone\n      knows. He seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected\n      with herself, as distinguished from the Alice-Chisane likeness, and he\n      said one or two things which, if Alice Chisane had been still betrothed to\n      him, could scarcely have been excused, even on the grounds of the\n      likeness. But Mrs. Haggert turned the remarks aside, and spent a long time\n      in making Hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been to him\n      because of her strange resemblance to his old love. Hannasyde groaned in\n      his saddle and said, \"Yes, indeed,\" and busied himself with preparations\n      for her departure to the Frontier, feeling very small and miserable.",
                "The last day of her stay at Lucknow came, and Hannasyde saw her off at the\n      Railway Station. She was very grateful for his kindness and the trouble he\n      had taken, and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one who knew the\n      Alice-Chisane reason of that kindness. And Hannasyde abused the coolies\n      with the luggage, and hustled the people on the platform, and prayed that\n      the roof might fall in and slay him.",
                "As the train went out slowly, Mrs. Landys-Haggert leaned out of the window\n      to say goodbye: -- \"On second thoughts au revoir, Mr. Hannasyde. I go\n      Home in the Spring, and perhaps I may meet you in Town.\"",
                "Hannasyde shook hands, and said very earnestly and adoringly: -- \"I\n      hope to Heaven I shall never see your face again!\"",
                "And Mrs. Haggert understood."

                "One of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in\n      the painter's sense. There are no half-tints worth noticing. Men stand out\n      all crude and raw, with nothing to tone them down, and nothing to scale\n      them against. They do their work, and grow to think that there is nothing\n      but their work, and nothing like their work, and that they are the real\n      pivots on which the administration turns. Here is an instance of this\n      feeling. A half-caste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office. He said to\n      me: -- \"Do you know what would happen if I added or took away one\n      single line on this sheet?\" Then, with the air of a conspirator: -- \"It\n      would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the whole\n      of the Presidency Circle! Think of that?\"",
                "If men had not this delusion as to the ultra-importance of their own\n      particular employments, I suppose that they would sit down and kill\n      themselves. But their weakness is wearisome, particularly when the\n      listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin.",
                "Even the Secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an\n      over-driven Executive Officer to take census of wheat-weevils through a\n      district of five thousand square miles.",
                "There was a man once in the Foreign Office -- a man who had grown\n      middle-aged in the department, and was commonly said, by irreverent\n      juniors, to be able to repeat Aitchison's \"Treaties and Sunnuds\"\n       backwards, in his sleep. What he did with his stored knowledge only the\n      Secretary knew; and he, naturally, would not publish the news abroad. This\n      man's name was Wressley, and it was the Shibboleth, in those days, to say: -- \"Wressley\n      knows more about the Central Indian States than any living man.\" If you\n      did not say this, you were considered one of mean understanding.",
                "Now-a-days, the man who says that he knows the ravel of the inter-tribal\n      complications across the Border is of more use; but in Wressley's time,\n      much attention was paid to the Central Indian States. They were called\n      \"foci\" and \"factors,\" and all manner of imposing names.",
                "And here the curse of Anglo-Indian life fell heavily. When Wressley lifted\n      up his voice, and spoke about such-and-such a succession to such-and-such\n      a throne, the Foreign Office were silent, and Heads of Departments\n      repeated the last two or three words of Wressley's sentences, and tacked\n      \"yes, yes,\" on them, and knew that they were \"assisting the Empire to\n      grapple with seriouspolitical contingencies.\" In most big undertakings,\n      one or two men do the work while the rest sit near and talk till the ripe\n      decorations begin to fall.",
                "Wressley was the working-member of the Foreign Office firm, and, to keep\n      him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging, he was made much of\n      by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was.",
                "He did not require coaxing, because he was of tough build, but what he\n      received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite so\n      absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of India as\n      Wressley of the Foreign Office. There might be other good men, but the\n      known, honored and trusted man among men was Wressley of the Foreign\n      Office. We had a Viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to \"gentle\" a\n      fractious big man and to hearten up a collar-galled little one, and so\n      keep all his team level. He conveyed to Wressley the impression which I\n      have just set down; and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a\n      Viceroy's praise. There was a case once -- but that is another story.",
                "All India knew Wressley's name and office -- it was in Thacker and\n      Spink's Directory -- but who he was personally, or what he did, or what\n      his special merits were, not fifty men knew or cared. His work filled all\n      his time, and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond those\n      of dead Rajput chiefs with Ahir blots in their 'scutcheons. Wressley would\n      have made a very good Clerk in the Herald's College had he not been a\n      Bengal Civilian.",
                "Upon a day, between office and office, great trouble came to Wressley -- overwhelmed\n      him, knocked him down, and left him gasping as though he had been a little\n      school-boy. Without reason, against prudence, and at a moment's notice, he\n      fell in love with a frivolous, golden-haired girl who used to tear about\n      Simla Mall on a high, rough waler, with a blue velvet jockey-cap crammed\n      over her eyes. Her name was Venner -- Tillie Venner -- and she was\n      delightful.",
                "She took Wressley's heart at a hand-gallop, and Wressley found that it was\n      not good for man to live alone; even with half the Foreign Office Records\n      in his presses.",
                "Then Simla laughed, for Wressley in love was slightly ridiculous.",
                "He did his best to interest the girl in himself -- that is to say, his\n      work -- and she, after the manner of women, did her best to appear\n      interested in what, behind his back, she called \"Mr. Wressley's Wajahs\";\n      for she lisped very prettily. She did not understand one little thing\n      about them, but she acted as if she did. Men have married on that sort of\n      error before now.",
                "Providence, however, had care of Wressley. He was immensely struck with\n      Miss Venner's intelligence. He would have been more impressed had he heard\n      her private and confidential accounts of his calls. He held peculiar\n      notions as to the wooing of girls. He said that the best work of a man's\n      career should be laid reverently at their feet.",
                "Ruskin writes something like this somewhere, I think; but in ordinary life\n      a few kisses are better and save time.",
                "About a month after he had lost his heart to Miss Venner, and had been\n      doing his work vilely in consequence, the first idea of his \"Native Rule\n      in Central India\" struck Wressley and filled him with joy. It was, as he\n      sketched it, a great thing -- the work of his life -- a really\n      comprehensive survey of a most fascinating subject -- to be written\n      with all the special and laboriously acquired knowledge of Wressley of the\n      Foreign Office -- a gift fit for an Empress.",
                "He told Miss Venner that he was going to take leave, and hoped, on his\n      return, to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance. Would she wait?\n      Certainly she would. Wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month. She\n      would wait a year for that. Her mamma would help her to wait.",
                "So Wressley took one year's leave and all the available documents, about a\n      truck-load, that he could lay hands on, and went down to Central India\n      with his notion hot in his head. He began his book in the land he was\n      writing of. Too much official correspondence had made him a frigid\n      workman, and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of local\n      color on his palette. This is a dangerous paint for amateurs to play with.",
                "Heavens, how that man worked! He caught his Rajahs, analyzed his Rajahs,\n      and traced them up into the mists of Time and beyond, with their queens\n      and their concubines. He dated and cross-dated, pedigreed and\n      triple-pedigreed, compared, noted, connoted, wove, strung, sorted,\n      selected, inferred, calendared and counter-calendared for ten hours a day.\n      And, because this sudden and new light of Love was upon him, he turned\n      those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into things to\n      weep or to laugh over as he pleased. His heart and soul were at the end of\n      his pen, and they got into the ink. He was dowered with sympathy, insight,\n      humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and nights; and his book\n      was a Book. He had his vast special knowledge with him, so to speak; but\n      the spirit, the woven-in human Touch, the poetry and the power of the\n      output, were beyond all special knowledge. But I doubt whether he knew the\n      gift that was in him then, and thus he may have lost some happiness. He\n      was toiling for Tillie Venner, not for himself.",
                "Men often do their best work blind, for some one else's sake.",
                "Also, though this has nothing to do with the story, in India where every\n      one knows every one else, you can watch men being driven, by the women who\n      govern them, out of the rank-and-file and sent to take up points alone. A\n      good man once started, goes forward; but an average man, so soon as the\n      woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her power, comes back\n      to the battalion and is no more heard of.",
                "Wressley bore the first copy of his book to Simla and, blushing and\n      stammering, presented it to Miss Venner. She read a little of it.",
                "I give her review verbatim: -- \"Oh, your book? It's all about those\n      how-wid Wajahs. I didn't understand it.\".........",
                "Wressley of the Foreign Office was broken, smashed, -- I am not\n      exaggerating -- by this one frivolous little girl. All that he could\n      say feebly was: -- \"But, but it's my magnum opus! The work of my life.\"\n       Miss Venner did not know what magnum opus meant; but she knew that Captain\n      Kerrington had won three races at the last Gymkhana. Wressley didn't press\n      her to wait for him any longer. He had sense enough for that.",
                "Then came the reaction after the year's strain, and Wressley went back to\n      the Foreign Office and his \"Wajahs,\" a compiling, gazetteering,\n      report-writing hack, who would have been dear at three hundred rupees a\n      month. He abided by Miss Venner's review. Which proves that the\n      inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with himself.\n      Nevertheless, he had no right to sink, in a hill-tarn, five packing-cases,\n      brought up at enormous expense from Bombay, of the best book of Indian\n      history ever written.",
                "When he sold off before retiring, some years later, I was turning over his\n      shelves, and came across the only existing copy of \"Native Rule in Central\n      India\" -- the copy that Miss Venner could not understand. I read it,\n      sitting on his mule-trucks, as long as the light lasted, and offered him\n      his own price for it. He looked over my shoulder for a few pages and said\n      to himself drearily: -- \"Now, how in the world did I come to write such\n      damned good stuff as that?\" Then to me: -- \"Take it and keep it. Write\n      one of your penny-farthing yarns about its birth. Perhaps -- perhaps -- the\n      whole business may have been ordained to that end.\"",
                "Which, knowing what Wressley of the Foreign Office was once, struck me as\n      about the bitterest thing that I had ever heard a man say of his own work."

                "This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made, and where\n      the bounds of the Possible are put down. I have lived long enough in this\n      country to know that it is best to know nothing, and can only write the\n      story as it happened.",
                "Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki, and we called him \"Dormouse,\"\n       because he was a round little, sleepy little man. He was a good Doctor and\n      never quarrelled with any one, not even with our Deputy Commissioner, who\n      had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse. He married a girl as\n      round and as sleepy-looking as himself. She was a Miss Hillardyce,\n      daughter of \"Squash\" Hillardyce of the Berars, who married his Chief's\n      daughter by mistake. But that is another story.",
                "A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long; but there is nothing\n      to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years. This is a\n      delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one another.\n      They can live absolutely alone and without interruption -- just as the\n      Dormice did. These two little people retired from the world after their\n      marriage, and were very happy. They were forced, of course, to give\n      occasional dinners, but they made no friends hereby, and the Station went\n      its own way and forgot them; only saying, occasionally, that Dormouse was\n      the best of good fellows, though dull. A Civil Surgeon who never quarrels\n      is a rarity, appreciated as such.",
                "Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhere -- least of all\n      in India, where we are few in the land, and very much dependent on each\n      other's kind offices. Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world\n      for a year, and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid\n      broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather, and his wife\n      went down. He was a shy little man, and five days were wasted before he\n      realized that Mrs. Dumoise was burning with something worse than simple\n      fever, and three days more passed before he ventured to call on Mrs.\n      Shute, the Engineer's wife, and timidly speak about his trouble. Nearly\n      every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless in typhoid.\n      The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses, minute by\n      minute and degree by degree. Mrs. Shute almost boxed Dumoise's ears for\n      what she called his \"criminal delay,\" and went off at once to look after\n      the poor girl. We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station that winter\n      and, as the average of death is about one in every five cases, we felt\n      certain that we should have to lose somebody. But all did their best. The\n      women sat up nursing the women, and the men turned to and tended the\n      bachelors who were down, and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for\n      fifty-six days, and brought them through the Valley of the Shadow in\n      triumph. But, just when we thought all was over, and were going to give a\n      dance to celebrate the victory, little Mrs. Dumoise got a relapse and died\n      in a week and the Station went to the funeral. Dumoise broke down utterly\n      at the brink of the grave, and had to be taken away.",
                "After the death, Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be\n      comforted. He did his duties perfectly, but we all felt that he should go\n      on leave, and the other men of his own Service told him so. Dumoise was\n      very thankful for the suggestion -- he was thankful for anything in\n      those days -- and went to Chini on a walking-tour.",
                "Chini is some twenty marches from Simla, in the heart of the Hills, and\n      the scenery is good if you are in trouble. You pass through big, still\n      deodar-forests, and under big, still cliffs, and over big, still\n      grass-downs swelling like a woman's breasts; and the wind across the\n      grass, and the rain among the deodars says: -- \"Hush -- hush -- hush.\"\n       So little Dumoise was packed off to Chini, to wear down his grief with a\n      full-plate camera, and a rifle. He took also a useless bearer, because the\n      man had been his wife's favorite servant. He was idle and a thief, but\n      Dumoise trusted everything to him.",
                "On his way back from Chini, Dumoise turned aside to Bagi, through the\n      Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo. Some men who have\n      travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is\n      one of the finest in creation. It runs through dark wet forest, and ends\n      suddenly in bleak, nipped hill-side and black rocks. Bagi dak-bungalow is\n      open to all the winds and is bitterly cold. Few people go to Bagi. Perhaps\n      that was the reason why Dumoise went there. He halted at seven in the\n      evening, and his bearer went down the hill-side to the village to engage\n      coolies for the next day's march. The sun had set, and the night-winds\n      were beginning to croon among the rocks. Dumoise leaned on the railing of\n      the verandah, waiting for his bearer to return. The man came back almost\n      immediately after he had disappeared, and at such a rate that Dumoise\n      fancied he must have crossed a bear. He was running as hard as he could up\n      the face of the hill.",
                "But there was no bear to account for his terror. He raced to the verandah\n      and fell down, the blood spurting from his nose and his face iron-gray.\n      Then he gurgled: -- \"I have seen the Memsahib! I have seen the\n      Memsahib!\"",
                "\"Where?\" said Dumoise.",
                "\"Down there, walking on the road to the village. She was in a blue dress,\n      and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and said: -- 'Ram Dass, give my\n      salaams to the Sahib, and tell him that I shall meet him next month at\n      Nuddea.' Then I ran away, because I was afraid.\"",
                "What Dumoise said or did I do not know. Ram Dass declares that he said\n      nothing, but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night, waiting\n      for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into the\n      dark like a madman. But no Memsahib came, and, next day, he went on to\n      Simla cross-questioning the bearer every hour.",
                "Ram Dass could only say that he had met Mrs. Dumoise and that she had\n      lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully\n      repeated to Dumoise. To this statement Ram Dass adhered.",
                "He did not know where Nuddea was, had no friends at Nuddea, and would most\n      certainly never go to Nuddea; even though his pay were doubled.",
                "Nuddea is in Bengal, and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor serving\n      in the Punjab. It must be more than twelve hundred miles from Meridki.",
                "Dumoise went through Simla without halting, and returned to Meridki there\n      to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during\n      his tour. There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained, and some\n      recent orders of the Surgeon-General to be noted, and, altogether, the\n      taking-over was a full day's work. In the evening, Dumoise told his locum\n      tenens, who was an old friend of his bachelor days, what had happened at\n      Bagi; and the man said that Ram Dass might as well have chosen Tuticorin\n      while he was about it.",
                "At that moment a telegraph-peon came in with a telegram from Simla,\n      ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki, but to go at once to\n      Nuddea on special duty. There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at Nuddea,\n      and the Bengal Government, being shorthanded, as usual, had borrowed a\n      Surgeon from the Punjab.",
                "Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and said: -- \"Well?\"",
                "The other Doctor said nothing. It was all that he could say.",
                "Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way from\n      Bagi; and thus might, possibly, have heard the first news of the impending\n      transfer.",
                "He tried to put the question, and the implied suspicion into words, but\n      Dumoise stopped him with: -- \"If I had desired THAT, I should never\n      have come back from Chini. I was shooting there. I wish to live, for I\n      have things to do.... but I shall not be sorry.\"",
                "The other man bowed his head, and helped, in the twilight, to pack up\n      Dumoise's just opened trunks. Ram Dass entered with the lamps.",
                "\"Where is the Sahib going?\" he asked.",
                "\"To Nuddea,\" said Dumoise, softly.",
                "Ram Dass clawed Dumoise's knees and boots and begged him not to go.",
                "Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room. Then he\n      wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character. He was\n      not going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die, and, perhaps to die himself.",
                "So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone; the other\n      Doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death.",
                "Eleven days later, he had joined his Memsahib; and the Bengal Government\n      had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea. The\n      first importation lay dead in Chooadanga Dak-Bungalow."

That was the beginning of my acquaintance\n      with McIntosh Jellaludin. When a loafer, and drunk, sings The Song of the\n      Bower, he must be worth cultivating.

He was a tall, well-built, fair man fearfully shaken with drink,\n      and he looked nearer fifty than the thirty-five which, he said, was his\n      real age. When a man begins to sink in India, and is not sent Home by his\n      friends as soon as may be, he falls very low from a respectable point of\n      view.

I did not like being patronized by a loafer,\n      but I was his guest for the time being, though he owned only one very torn\n      alpaca-coat and a pair of trousers made out of gunny-bags. He took the\n      pipe out of his mouth, and went on judicially: -- \"All things\n      considered, I doubt whether you are the luckier. I do not refer to your\n      extremely limited classical attainments, or your excruciating quantities,\n      but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately under your notice.\n      That for instance.\" -- He pointed to a woman cleaning a samovar near\n      the well in the centre of the Serai.

On those occasions the native woman tended him while he\n      raved in all tongues except his own. One day, indeed, he began reciting\n      Atalanta in Calydon, and went through it to the end, beating time to the\n      swing of the verse with a bedstead-leg. But he did most of his ravings in\n      Greek or German.

She\n      brought out a big bundle, wrapped in the tail of a petticoat, of old\n      sheets of miscellaneous note-paper, all numbered and covered with fine\n      cramped writing. McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and\n      stirred it up lovingly.",
                "\"This,\" he said, \"is my work -- the Book of McIntosh Jellaludin,\n      showing what he saw and how he lived, and what befell him and others;\n      being also an account of the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin.\n      What Mirza Murad Ali Beg's book is to all other books on native life, will\n      my work be to Mirza Murad Ali Beg's!\"",
                "This, as will be conceded by any one who knows Mirza Ali Beg's book, was a\n      sweeping statement. The papers did not look specially valuable; but\n      McIntosh handled them as if they were currency-notes.",
                "Then he said slowly: -- \"In despite the many weaknesses of your\n      education, you have been good to me. I will speak of your tobacco when I\n      reach the Gods. I owe you much thanks for many kindnesses.",
                "\"But I abominate indebtedness. For this reason I bequeath to you now the\n      monument more enduring than brass -- my one book -- rude and\n      imperfect in parts, but oh, how rare in others! I wonder if you will\n      understand it. It is a gift more honorable than... Bah! where is my brain\n      rambling to? You will mutilate it horribly. You will knock out the gems\n      you call 'Latin quotations,' you Philistine, and you will butcher the\n      style to carve into your own jerky jargon; but you cannot destroy the\n      whole of it. I bequeath it to you.",
                "\"Ethel... My brain again!.. Mrs. McIntosh, bear witness that I give the\n      sahib all these papers. They would be of no use to you, Heart of my heart;\n      and I lay it upon you,\" he turned to me here, \"that you do not let my book\n      die in its present form. It is yours unconditionally -- the story of\n      McIntosh Jellaludin, which is NOT the story of McIntosh Jellaludin, but of\n      a greater man than he, and of a far greater woman. Listen now! I am\n      neither mad nor drunk! That book will make you famous.\"",
                "I said, \"thank you,\" as the native woman put the bundle into my arms.",
                "\"My only baby!\" said McIntosh with a smile. He was sinking fast, but he\n      continued to talk as long as breath remained. I waited for the end:\n      knowing that, in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his mother.\n      He turned on his side and said: --",
                "\"Say how it came into your possession. No one will believe you, but my\n      name, at least, will live. You will treat it brutally, I know you will.\n      Some of it must go; the public are fools and prudish fools. I was their\n      servant once. But do your mangling gently -- very gently. It is a great\n      work, and I have paid for it in seven years' damnation.\"",
                "His voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths, and then he began mumbling a\n      prayer of some kind in Greek. The native woman cried very bitterly.\n      Lastly, he rose in bed and said, as loudly as slowly: -- \"Not guilty,\n      my Lord!\"",
                "Then he fell back, and the stupor held him till he died. The native woman\n      ran into the Serai among the horses and screamed and beat her breasts; for\n      she had loved him.",
                "Perhaps his last sentence in life told what McIntosh had once gone\n      through; but, saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth, there was\n      nothing in his room to say who or what he had been.",
                "The papers were in a hopeless muddle.",
                "Strickland helped me to sort them, and he said that the writer was either\n      an extreme liar or a most wonderful person. He thought the former. One of\n      these days, you may be able to judge for yourself.",
                "The bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense, at the\n      head of the chapters, which has all been cut out.",
                "If the things are ever published some one may perhaps remember this story,\n      now printed as a safeguard to prove that McIntosh Jellaludin and not I\n      myself wrote the Book of Mother Maturin.",

                "The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without\n      pistol-practice. After much forethought and self-denial, Dick had saved\n      seven shillings and sixpence, the price of a badly constructed Belgian\n      revolver. Maisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for\n      the purchase of a hundred cartridges. \"You can save better than I can,\n      Dick,\" she explained; \"I like nice things to eat, and it doesn't matter to\n      you. Besides, boys ought to do these things.\"",
                "Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement, but went out and made the\n      purchase, which the children were then on their way to test. Revolvers did\n      not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the\n      guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to\n      these two orphans. Dick had been under her care for six years, during\n      which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be\n      expended on his clothes, and, partly through thoughtlessness, partly\n      through a natural desire to pain, -- she was a widow of some years\n      anxious to marry again, -- had made his days burdensome on his young\n      shoulders.",
                "Where he had looked for love, she gave him first aversion and then hate.",
                "Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy, she gave him\n      ridicule. The many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her\n      small house she devoted to what she called the home-training of Dick\n      Heldar. Her religion, manufactured in the main by her own intelligence and\n      a keen study of the Scriptures, was an aid to her in this matter. At such\n      times as she herself was not personally displeased with Dick, she left him\n      to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his Creator;\n      wherefore Dick learned to loathe his God as intensely as he loathed Mrs.\n      Jennett; and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the young. Since\n      she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar, when dread of pain drove him\n      to his first untruth he naturally developed into a liar, but an economical\n      and self-contained one, never throwing away the least unnecessary fib, and\n      never hesitating at the blackest, were it only plausible, that might make\n      his life a little easier. The treatment taught him at least the power of\n      living alone, -- a power that was of service to him when he went to a\n      public school and the boys laughed at his clothes, which were poor in\n      quality and much mended. In the holidays he returned to the teachings of\n      Mrs. Jennett, and, that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by\n      association with the world, was generally beaten, on one account or\n      another, before he had been twelve hours under her roof.",
                "The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage, a long-haired,\n      gray-eyed little atom, as self-contained as himself, who moved about the\n      house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was\n      her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the back-garden. Mrs. Jennett\n      objected to the goat on the grounds that he was un-Christian, -- which\n      he certainly was. \"Then,\" said the atom, choosing her words very\n      deliberately, \"I shall write to my lawyer-peoples and tell them that you\n      are a very bad woman. Amomma is mine, mine, mine!\" Mrs. Jennett made a\n      movement to the hall, where certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack.\n      The atom understood as clearly as Dick what this meant. \"I have been\n      beaten before,\" she said, still in the same passionless voice; \"I have\n      been beaten worse than you can ever beat me. If you beat me I shall write\n      to my lawyer-peoples and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat.\n      I am not afraid of you.\" Mrs. Jennett did not go into the hall, and the\n      atom, after a pause to assure herself that all danger of war was past,\n      went out, to weep bitterly on Amomma's neck.",
                "Dick learned to know her as Maisie, and at first mistrusted her\n      profoundly, for he feared that she might interfere with the small liberty\n      of action left to him. She did not, however; and she volunteered no\n      friendliness until Dick had taken the first steps. Long before the\n      holidays were over, the stress of punishment shared in common drove the\n      children together, if it were only to play into each other's hands as they\n      prepared lies for Mrs. Jennett's use. When Dick returned to school, Maisie\n      whispered, \"Now I shall be all alone to take care of myself; but,\" and she\n      nodded her head bravely, \"I can do it. You promised to send Amomma a grass\n      collar. Send it soon.\" A week later she asked for that collar by return of\n      post, and was not pleased when she learned that it took time to make. When\n      at last Dick forwarded the gift, she forgot to thank him for it.",
                "Many holidays had come and gone since that day, and Dick had grown into a\n      lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes. Not for a\n      moment had Mrs. Jennett relaxed her tender care of him, but the average\n      canings of a public school -- Dick fell under punishment about three\n      times a month -- filled him with contempt for her powers. \"She doesn't\n      hurt,\" he explained to Maisie, who urged him to rebellion, \"and she is\n      kinder to you after she has whacked me.\" Dick shambled through the days\n      unkempt in body and savage in soul, as the smaller boys of the school\n      learned to know, for when the spirit moved him he would hit them,\n      cunningly and with science. The same spirit made him more than once try to\n      tease Maisie, but the girl refused to be made unhappy. \"We are both\n      miserable as it is,\" said she. \"What is the use of trying to make things\n      worse? Let's find things to do, and forget things.\"",
                "The pistol was the outcome of that search. It could only be used on the\n      muddiest foreshore of the beach, far away from the bathing-machines and\n      pierheads, below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out\n      nearly two miles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks, touched\n      by the sun, sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was late in the\n      afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground, Amomma trotting\n      patiently behind them.",
                "\"Mf!\" said Maisie, sniffing the air. \"I wonder what makes the sea so\n      smelly? I don'tlike it!\"",
                "\"You never like anything that isn't made just for you,\" said Dick bluntly.\n      \"Give me the cartridges, and I'll try first shot. How far does one of\n      these little revolvers carry?\"",
                "\"Oh, half a mile,\" said Maisie, promptly. \"At least it makes an awful\n      noise. Be careful with the cartridges; I don't like those jagged stick-up\n      things on the rim. Dick, do be careful.\"",
                "\"All right. I know how to load. I'll fire at the breakwater out there.\"",
                "He fired, and Amomma ran away bleating. The bullet threw up a spurt of mud\n      to the right of the wood-wreathed piles.",
                "\"Throws high and to the right. You try, Maisie. Mind, it's loaded all\n      round.\"",
                "Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud, her\n      hand firmly closed on the butt, her mouth and left eye screwed up.",
                "Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma returned very\n      cautiously. He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon\n      walks, and, finding the cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations with\n      his nose. Maisie fired, but could not see where the bullet went.",
                "\"I think it hit the post,\" she said, shading her eyes and looking out\n      across the sailless sea.",
                "\"I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell-buoy,\" said Dick, with a\n      chuckle. \"Fire low and to the left; then perhaps you'll get it. Oh, look\n      at Amomma! -- he's eating the cartridges!\"",
                "Maisie turned, the revolver in her hand, just in time to see Amomma\n      scampering away from the pebbles Dick threw after him. Nothing is sacred\n      to a billy-goat. Being well fed and the adored of his mistress, Amomma had\n      naturally swallowed two loaded pin-fire cartridges. Maisie hurried up to\n      assure herself that Dick had not miscounted the tale.",
                "\"Yes, he's eaten two.\"",
                "\"Horrid little beast! Then they'll joggle about inside him and blow up,\n      and serve him right.... Oh, Dick! have I killed you?\"",
                "Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with. Maisie could not\n      explain how it had happened, but a veil of reeking smoke separated her\n      from Dick, and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his\n      face. Then she heard him sputter, and dropped on her knees beside him,\n      crying, \"Dick, you aren't hurt, are you? I didn't mean it.\"",
                "\"Of course you didn't,\" said Dick, coming out of the smoke and wiping his\n      cheek. \"But you nearly blinded me. That powder stuff stings awfully.\" A\n      neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had\n      gone. Maisie began to whimper.",
                "\"Don't,\" said Dick, jumping to his feet and shaking himself. \"I'm not a\n      bit hurt.\"",
                "\"No, but I might have killed you,\" protested Maisie, the corners of her\n      mouth drooping. \"What should I have done then?\"",
                "\"Gone home and told Mrs. Jennett.\" Dick grinned at the thought; then,\n      softening, \"Please don't worry about it. Besides, we are wasting time.\n      We've got to get back to tea. I'll take the revolver for a bit.\"",
                "Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's\n      indifference, albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol,\n      restrained her. She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically\n      bombarded the breakwater. \"Got it at last!\" he exclaimed, as a lock of\n      weed flew from the wood.",
                "\"Let me try,\" said Maisie, imperiously. \"I'm all right now.\"",
                "They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself\n      to pieces, and Amomma the outcast -- because he might blow up at any\n      moment -- browsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown\n      at him. Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which was\n      commanded by the seaward slope of Fort Keeling, and they sat down together\n      before this new target.",
                "\"Next holidays,\" said Dick, as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked\n      wildly in his hand, \"we'll get another pistol, -- central fire, -- that\n      will carry farther.\"",
                "\"There won't be any next holidays for me,\" said Maisie. \"I'm going away.\"",
                "\"Where to?\"",
                "\"I don't know. My lawyers have written to Mrs. Jennett, and I've got to be\n      educated somewhere, -- in France, perhaps, -- I don'tknow where; but\n      I shall be glad to go away.\"",
                "\"I shan't like it a bit. I suppose I shall be left. Look here, Maisie, is\n      it really true you're going? Then these holidays will be the last I shall\n      see anything of you; and I go back to school next week. I wish --  -- \"",
                "The young blood turned his cheeks scarlet. Maisie was picking grass-tufts\n      and throwing them down the slope at a yellow sea-poppy nodding all by\n      itself to the illimitable levels of the mud-flats and the milk-white sea\n      beyond.",
                "\"I wish,\" she said, after a pause, \"that I could see you again sometime.\n      You wish that, too?\"",
                "\"Yes, but it would have been better if -- if -- you had -- shot\n      straight over there -- down by the breakwater.\"",
                "Maisie looked with large eyes for a moment. And this was the boy who only\n      ten days before had decorated Amomma's horns with cut-paper ham-frills and\n      turned him out, a bearded derision, among the public ways! Then she\n      dropped her eyes: this was not the boy.",
                "\"Don't be stupid,\" she said reprovingly, and with swift instinct attacked\n      the side-issue. \"How selfish you are! Just think what I should have felt\n      if that horrid thing had killed you! I'm quite miserable enough already.\"",
                "\"Why? Because you're going away from Mrs. Jennett?\"",
                "\"No.\"",
                "\"From me, then?\"",
                "No answer for a long time. Dick dared not look at her. He felt, though he\n      did not know, all that the past four years had been to him, and this the\n      more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words.",
                "\"I don't know,\" she said. \"I suppose it is.\"",
                "\"Maisie, you must know. I'm not supposing.\"",
                "\"Let's go home,\" said Maisie, weakly.",
                "But Dick was not minded to retreat.",
                "\"I can't say things,\" he pleaded, \"and I'm awfully sorry for teasing you\n      about Amomma the other day. It's all different now, Maisie, can't you see?\n      And you might have told me that you were going, instead of leaving me to\n      find out.\"",
                "\"You didn't. I did tell. Oh, Dick, what's the use of worrying?\"",
                "\"There isn't any; but we've been together years and years, and I didn't\n      know how much I cared.\"",
                "\"I don't believe you ever did care.\"",
                "\"No, I didn't; but I do, -- I care awfully now, Maisie,\" he gulped, -- \"Maisie,\n      darling, say you care too, please.\"",
                "\"I do, indeed I do; but it won't be any use.\"",
                "\"Why?\"",
                "\"Because I am going away.\"",
                "\"Yes, but if you promise before you go. Only say -- will you?\" A second\n      \"darling\" came to his lips more easily than the first. There were few\n      endearments in Dick's home or school life; he had to find them by\n      instinct. Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of\n      the revolver.",
                "\"I promise,\" she said solemnly; \"but if I care there is no need for\n      promising.\"",
                "\"And do you care?\" For the first time in the past few minutes their eyes\n      met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech....",
                "\"Oh, Dick, don't! Please don't! It was all right when we said\n      good-morning; but now it's all different!\" Amomma looked on from afar.",
                "He had seen his property quarrel frequently, but he had never seen kisses\n      exchanged before. The yellow sea-poppy was wiser, and nodded its head\n      approvingly. Considered as a kiss, that was a failure, but since it was\n      the first, other than those demanded by duty, in all the world that either\n      had ever given or taken, it opened to them new worlds, and every one of\n      them glorious, so that they were lifted above the consideration of any\n      worlds at all, especially those in which tea is necessary, and sat still,\n      holding each other's hands and saying not a word.",
                "\"You can't forget now,\" said Dick, at last. There was that on his cheek\n      that stung more than gunpowder.",
                "\"I shouldn't have forgotten anyhow,\" said Maisie, and they looked at each\n      other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour ago to a\n      wonder and a mystery they could not understand. The sun began to set, and\n      a night-wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore.",
                "\"We shall be awfully late for tea,\" said Maisie. \"Let's go home.\"",
                "\"Let's use the rest of the cartridges first,\" said Dick; and he helped\n      Maisie down the slope of the fort to the sea, -- a descent that she was\n      quite capable of covering at full speed. Equally gravely Maisie took the\n      grimy hand. Dick bent forward clumsily; Maisie drew the hand away, and\n      Dick blushed.",
                "\"It's very pretty,\" he said.",
                "\"Pooh!\" said Maisie, with a little laugh of gratified vanity. She stood\n      close to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over\n      the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting\n      Maisie from all the evils in the world. A puddle far across the mud caught\n      the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red disc. The light\n      held Dick's attention for a moment, and as he raised his revolver there\n      fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous, in that he was standing\n      by Maisie who had promised to care for him for an indefinite length of\n      time till such date as --  -- A gust of the growing wind drove the\n      girl's long black hair across his face as she stood with her hand on his\n      shoulder calling Amomma \"a little beast,\" and for a moment he was in the\n      dark, -- a darkness that stung. The bullet went singing out to the\n      empty sea.",
                "\"Spoilt my aim,\" said he, shaking his head. \"There aren't any more\n      cartridges; we shall have to run home.\" But they did not run. They walked\n      very slowly, arm in arm. And it was a matter of indifference to them\n      whether the neglected Amomma with two pin-fire cartridges in his inside\n      blew up or trotted beside them; for they had come into a golden heritage\n      and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their years.",
                "\"And I shall be --  -- \" quoth Dick, valiantly. Then he checked\n      himself: \"I don't know what I shall be. I don't seem to be able to pass\n      any exams, but I can make awful caricatures of the masters. Ho! Ho!\"",
                "\"Be an artist, then,\" said Maisie. \"You're always laughing at my trying to\n      draw; and it will do you good.\"",
                "\"I'll never laugh at anything you do,\" he answered. \"I'll be an artist,\n      and I'll do things.\"",
                "\"Artists always want money, don'tthey?\"",
                "\"I've got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own. My guardians tell\n      me I'm to have it when I come of age. That will be enough to begin with.\"",
                "\"Ah, I'm rich,\" said Maisie. \"I've got three hundred a year all my own\n      when I'm twenty-one. That's why Mrs. Jennett is kinder to me than she is\n      to you. I wish, though, that I had somebody that belonged to me, -- just\n      a father or a mother.\"",
                "\"You belong to me,\" said Dick, \"for ever and ever.\"",
                "\"Yes, we belong -- for ever. It's very nice.\" She squeezed his arm. The\n      kindly darkness hid them both, and, emboldened because he could only just\n      see the profile of Maisie's cheek with the long lashes veiling the gray\n      eyes, Dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had been\n      boggling over for the last two hours.",
                "\"And I -- love you, Maisie,\" he said, in a whisper that seemed to him\n      to ring across the world, -- the world that he would tomorrow or the\n      next day set out to conquer.",
                "There was a scene, not, for the sake of discipline, to be reported, when\n      Mrs. Jennett would have fallen upon him, first for disgraceful\n      unpunctuality, and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden\n      weapon.",
                "\"I was playing with it, and it went off by itself,\" said Dick, when the\n      powder-pocked cheek could no longer be hidden, \"but if you think you're\n      going to lick me you're wrong. You are never going to touch me again. Sit\n      down and give me my tea. You can't cheat us out of that, anyhow.\"",
                "Mrs. Jennett gasped and became livid. Maisie said nothing, but encouraged\n      Dick with her eyes, and he behaved abominably all that evening. Mrs.\n      Jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of Providence and a descent into\n      Tophet later, but Dick walked in Paradise and would not hear. Only when he\n      was going to bed Mrs. Jennett recovered and asserted herself. He had\n      bidden Maisie good night with down-dropped eyes and from a distance.",
                "\"If you aren't a gentleman you might try to behave like one,\" said Mrs.\n      Jennett, spitefully. \"You've been quarrelling with Maisie again.\"",
                "This meant that the usual good-night kiss had been omitted. Maisie, white\n      to the lips, thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of indifference, and\n      was duly pecked by Dick, who tramped out of the room red as fire. That\n      night he dreamed a wild dream. He had won all the world and brought it to\n      Maisie in a cartridge-box, but she turned it over with her foot, and,\n      instead of saying \"Thank you,\" cried -- \"Where is the grass collar you\n      promised for Amomma? Oh, how selfish you are!\""

It was as though the brown weight of the river would drive\n      the white men back to their own country. The indescribable scent of Nile\n      mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next few miles\n      would be no light thing for the whale-boats to overpass. The desert ran\n      down almost to the banks, where, among gray, red, and black hillocks, a\n      camel-corps was encamped. No man dared even for a day lose touch of the\n      slow-moving boats; there had been no fighting for weeks past, and\n      throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them. Rapid had\n      followed rapid, rock rock, and island-group island-group, till the rank\n      and file had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of\n      time. They were moving somewhere, they did not know why, to do something,\n      they did not know what. Before them lay the Nile, and at the other end of\n      it was one Gordon, fighting for the dear life, in a town called Khartoum.\n      There were columns of British troops in the desert, or in one of the many\n      deserts; there were yet more columns waiting to embark on the river; there\n      were fresh drafts waiting at Assioot and Assuan; there were lies and\n      rumours running over the face of the hopeless land from Suakin to the\n      Sixth Cataract, and men supposed generally that there must be some one in\n      authority to direct the general scheme of the many movements. The duty of\n      that particular river-column was to keep the whale-boats afloat in the\n      water, to avoid trampling on the villagers' crops when the gangs \"tracked\"\n       the boats with lines thrown from midstream, to get as much sleep and food\n      as was possible, and, above all, to press on without delay in the teeth of\n      the churning Nile.",
                "With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers,\n      and they were almost as ignorant as their companions. But it was above all\n      things necessary that England at breakfast should be amused and thrilled\n      and interested, whether Gordon lived or died, or half the British army\n      went to pieces in the sands. The Soudan campaign was a picturesque one,\n      and lent itself to vivid word-painting. Now and again a \"Special\" managed\n      to get slain, -- which was not altogether a disadvantage to the paper\n      that employed him, -- and more often the hand-to-hand nature of the\n      fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which were worth telegraphing home\n      at eighteenpence the word. There were many correspondents with many corps\n      and columns, -- from the veterans who had followed on the heels of the\n      cavalry that occupied Cairo in '82, what time Arabi Pasha called himself\n      king, who had seen the first miserable work round Suakin when the sentries\n      were cut up nightly and the scrub swarmed with spears, to youngsters\n      jerked into the business at the end of a telegraph-wire to take the places\n      of their betters killed or invalided.",
                "Among the seniors -- those who knew every shift and change in the\n      perplexing postal arrangements, the value of the seediest, weediest\n      Egyptian garron offered for sale in Cairo or Alexandria, who could talk a\n      telegraph-clerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a newly\n      appointed staff-officer when press regulations became burdensome -- was\n      the man in the flannel shirt, the black-browed Torpenhow. He represented\n      the Central Southern Syndicate in the campaign, as he had represented it\n      in the Egyptian war, and elsewhere. The syndicate did not concern itself\n      greatly with criticisms of attack and the like. It supplied the masses,\n      and all it demanded was picturesqueness and abundance of detail; for there\n      is more joy in England over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of\n      square to rescue a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to\n      baldness at the gross details of transport and commissariat.",
                "He had met at Suakin a young man, sitting on the edge of a recently\n      abandoned redoubt about the size of a hat-box, sketching a clump of\n      shell-torn bodies on the gravel plain.",
                "\"What are you for?\" said Torpenhow. The greeting of the correspondent is\n      that of the commercial traveller on the road.",
                "\"My own hand,\" said the young man, without looking up. \"Have you any\n      tobacco?\"",
                "Torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished, and when he had looked at\n      it said, \"What's your business here?\"",
                "\"Nothing; there was a row, so I came. I'm supposed to be doing something\n      down at the painting-slips among the boats, or else I'm in charge of the\n      condenser on one of the water-ships. I've forgotten which.\"",
                "\"You've cheek enough to build a redoubt with,\" said Torpenhow, and took\n      stock of the new acquaintance. \"Do you always draw like that?\"",
                "The young man produced more sketches. \"Row on a Chinese pig-boat,\" said\n      he, sententiously, showing them one after another. -- \"Chief mate\n      dirked by a comprador. -- Junk ashore off Hakodate. -- Somali\n      muleteer being flogged. -- Star-shell bursting over camp at Berbera. -- Slave-dhow\n      being chased round Tajurrah Bah. -- Soldier lying dead in the moonlight\n      outside Suakin. -- throat cut by Fuzzies.\"",
                "\"H'm!\" said Torpenhow, \"can'tsay I care for Verestchagin-and-water myself,\n      but there's no accounting for tastes. Doing anything now, are you?\"",
                "\"No. I'm amusing myself here.\"",
                "Torpenhow looked at the sketches again, and nodded. \"Yes, you're right to\n      take your first chance when you can get it.\"",
                "He rode away swiftly through the Gate of the Two War-Ships, rattled across\n      the causeway into the town, and wired to his syndicate, \"Got man here,\n      picture-work. Good and cheap. Shall I arrange? Will do letterpress with\n      sketches.\"",
                "The man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring, \"I knew the\n      chance would come, sooner or later. By Gad, they'll have to sweat for it\n      if I come through this business alive!\"",
                "In the evening Torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the\n      Central Southern Agency was willing to take him on trial, paying expenses\n      for three months. \"And, by the way, what's your name?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Heldar. Do they give me a free hand?\"",
                "\"They've taken you on chance. You must justify the choice. You'd better\n      stick to me. I'm going up-country with a column, and I'll do what I can\n      for you. Give me some of your sketches taken here, and I'll send 'em\n      along.\" To himself he said, \"That's the best bargain the Central Southern\n      has ever made; and they got me cheaply enough.\"",
                "So it came to pass that, after some purchase of horse-flesh and\n      arrangements financial and political, Dick was made free of the New and\n      Honourable Fraternity of war correspondents, who all possess the\n      inalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much\n      for it as Providence and their owners shall please. To these things are\n      added in time, if the brother be worthy, the power of glib speech that\n      neither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question, the\n      eye of a horse-cope, the skill of a cook, the constitution of a bullock,\n      the digestion of an ostrich, and an infinite adaptability to all\n      circumstances. But many die before they attain to this degree, and the\n      past-masters in the craft appear for the most part in dress-clothes when\n      they are in England, and thus their glory is hidden from the multitude.",
                "Dick followed Torpenhow wherever the latter's fancy chose to lead him, and\n      between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost satisfied\n      themselves. It was not an easy life in any way, and under its influence\n      the two were drawn very closely together, for they ate from the same dish,\n      they shared the same water-bottle, and, most binding tie of all, their\n      mails went off together. It was Dick who managed to make gloriously drunk\n      a telegraph-clerk in a palm hut far beyond the Second Cataract, and, while\n      the man lay in bliss on the floor, possessed himself of some laboriously\n      acquired exclusive information, forwarded by a confiding correspondent of\n      an opposition syndicate, made a careful duplicate of the matter, and\n      brought the result to Torpenhow, who said that all was fair in love or war\n      correspondence, and built an excellent descriptive article from his\n      rival's riotous waste of words. It was Torpenhow who -- but the tale of\n      their adventures, together and apart, from Philae to the waste wilderness\n      of Herawi and Muella, would fill many books. They had been penned into a\n      square side by side, in deadly fear of being shot by over-excited\n      soldiers; they had fought with baggage-camels in the chill dawn; they had\n      jogged along in silence under blinding sun on indefatigable little\n      Egyptian horses; and they had floundered on the shallows of the Nile when\n      the whale-boat in which they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock\n      and rip out half her bottom-planks.",
                "Now they were sitting on the sand-bank, and the whale-boats were bringing\n      up the remainder of the column.",
                "\"Yes,\" said Torpenhow, as he put the last rude stitches into his\n      over-long-neglected gear, \"it has been a beautiful business.\"",
                "\"The patch or the campaign?\" said Dick. \"Don't think much of either,\n      myself.\"",
                "\"You want the Euryalus brought up above the Third Cataract, don't you? and\n      eighty-one-ton guns at Jakdul? Now, I'm quite satisfied with my breeches.\"\n       He turned round gravely to exhibit himself, after the manner of a clown.",
                "\"It's very pretty. Specially the lettering on the sack. G.B.T. Government\n      Bullock Train. That's a sack from India.\"",
                "\"It's my initials, -- Gilbert Belling Torpenhow. I stole the cloth on\n      purpose. What the mischief are the camel-corps doing yonder?\" Torpenhow\n      shaded his eyes and looked across the scrub-strewn gravel.",
                "A bugle blew furiously, and the men on the bank hurried to their arms and\n      accoutrements.",
                "\"'Pisan soldiery surprised while bathing,'\" remarked Dick, calmly.",
                "\"D'you remember the picture? It's by Michael Angelo; all beginners copy\n      it. That scrub's alive with enemy.\"",
                "The camel-corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them, and a\n      hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had\n      wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it. As swiftly as a\n      reach of still water is crisped by the wind, the rock-strewn ridges and\n      scrub-topped hills were troubled and alive with armed men.",
                "Mercifully, it occurred to these to stand far off for a time, to shout and\n      gesticulate joyously. One man even delivered himself of a long story. The\n      camel-corps did not fire. They were only too glad of a little\n      breathing-space, until some sort of square could be formed. The men on the\n      sand-bank ran to their side; and the whale-boats, as they toiled up within\n      shouting distance, were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all\n      save the sick and a few men to guard them. The Arab orator ceased his\n      outcries, and his friends howled.",
                "\"They look like the Mahdi's men,\" said Torpenhow, elbowing himself into\n      the crush of the square; \"but what thousands of 'em there are! The tribes\n      hereabout aren't against us, I know.\"",
                "\"Then the Mahdi's taken another town,\" said Dick, \"and set all these\n      yelping devils free to show us up. Lend us your glass.\"",
                "\"Our scouts should have told us of this. We've been trapped,\" said a\n      subaltern. \"Aren't the camel guns ever going to begin? Hurry up, you men!\"",
                "There was no need of any order. The men flung themselves panting against\n      the sides of the square, for they had good reason to know that whoso was\n      left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an\n      extremely unpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound\n      camel-guns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the\n      square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising\n      ground. All had fought in this manner many times before, and there was no\n      novelty in the entertainment; always the same hot and stifling formation,\n      the smell of dust and leather, the same boltlike rush of the enemy, the\n      same pressure on the weakest side, the few minutes of hand-to-hand\n      scuffle, and then the silence of the desert, broken only by the yells of\n      those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse. They had become\n      careless. The camel-guns spoke at intervals, and the square slouched\n      forward amid the protesting of the camels. Then came the attack of three\n      thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for\n      troops in close order to attack against breech-loading fire.",
                "A few dropping shots heralded their approach, and a few horsemen led, but\n      the bulk of the force was naked humanity, mad with rage, and armed with\n      the spear and the sword. The instinct of the desert, where there is always\n      much war, told them that the right flank of the square was the weakest,\n      for they swung clear of the front. The camel-guns shelled them as they\n      passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst, most like\n      those quick-closing vistas in a Kentish hop-garden seen when the train\n      races by at full speed; and the infantry fire, held till the opportune\n      moment, dropped them in close-packing hundreds. No civilised troops in the\n      world could have endured the hell through which they came, the living\n      leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels, the wounded\n      cursing and staggering forward, till they fell -- a torrent black as\n      the sliding water above a mill-dam -- full on the right flank of the\n      square.",
                "Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead\n      went out in rolling smoke, and the little stones on the heated ground and\n      the tinder-dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest, for\n      men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things, counting\n      mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch. There\n      was no semblance of any concerted fighting. For aught the men knew, the\n      enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square at once. Their\n      business was to destroy what lay in front of them, to bayonet in the back\n      those who passed over them, and, dying, to drag down the slayer till he\n      could be knocked on the head by some avenging gun-butt.",
                "Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew\n      unendurable. It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was\n      repulsed, so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of\n      the square. There was a rush from without, the short hough-hough of the\n      stabbing spears, and a man on a horse, followed by thirty or forty others,\n      dashed through, yelling and hacking. The right flank of the square sucked\n      in after them, and the other sides sent help. The wounded, who knew that\n      they had but a few hours more to live, caught at the enemy's feet and\n      brought them down, or, staggering into a discarded rifle, fired blindly\n      into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the square.",
                "Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet,\n      that he had fired his revolver into a black, foam-flecked face which\n      forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face, and that Torpenhow had\n      gone down under an Arab whom he had tried to \"collar low,\" and was turning\n      over and over with his captive, feeling for the man's eyes. The doctor\n      jabbed at a venture with a bayonet, and a helmetless soldier fired over\n      Dick's shoulder: the flying grains of powder stung his cheek. It was to\n      Torpenhow that Dick turned by instinct. The representative of the Central\n      Southern Syndicate had shaken himself clear of his enemy, and rose, wiping\n      his thumb on his trousers. The Arab, both hands to his forehead, screamed\n      aloud, then snatched up his spear and rushed at Torpenhow, who was panting\n      under shelter of Dick's revolver. Dick fired twice, and the man dropped\n      limply. His upturned face lacked one eye. The musketry-fire redoubled, but\n      cheers mingled with it. The rush had failed and the enemy were flying. If\n      the heart of the square were shambles, the ground beyond was a butcher's\n      shop. Dick thrust his way forward between the maddened men. The remnant of\n      the enemy were retiring, as the few -- the very few -- English\n      cavalry rode down the laggards.",
                "Beyond the lines of the dead, a broad blood-stained Arab spear cast aside\n      in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub, and beyond this again the\n      illimitable dark levels of the desert. The sun caught the steel and turned\n      it into a red disc. Some one behind him was saying, \"Ah, get away, you\n      brute!\" Dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the desert. His eye\n      was held by the red splash in the distance, and the clamour about him\n      seemed to die down to a very far-away whisper, like the whisper of a level\n      sea. There was the revolver and the red light. ... and the voice of some\n      one scaring something away, exactly as had fallen somewhere before, -- a\n      darkness that stung. He fired at random, and the bullet went out across\n      the desert as he muttered, \"Spoilt my aim. There aren't any more\n      cartridges. We shall have to run home.\" He put his hand to his head and\n      brought it away covered with blood.",
                "\"Old man, you're cut rather badly,\" said Torpenhow. \"I owe you something\n      for this business. Thanks. Stand up! I say, you can't be ill here.\"",
                "Throughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats, a\n      black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and shouted\n      that Khartoum the accursed one was dead, -- was dead, -- was dead, -- that\n      two steamers were rock-staked on the Nile outside the city, and that of\n      all their crews there remained not one; and Khartoum was dead, -- was\n      dead, -- was dead! But Torpenhow took no heed. He was watching Dick,\n      who called aloud to the restless Nile for Maisie, -- and again Maisie!\n      \"Behold a phenomenon,\" said Torpenhow, rearranging the blanket. \"Here is a\n      man, presumably human, who mentions the name of one woman only. And I've\n      seen a good deal of delirium, too. -- Dick, here's some fizzy drink.\"",
                "\"Thank you, Maisie,\" said Dick."

                "THE SOUDAN campaign and Dick's broken head had been some months ended and\n      mended, and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain sum on\n      account for work done, which work they were careful to assure him was not\n      altogether up to their standard. Dick heaved the letter into the Nile at\n      Cairo, cashed the draft in the same town, and bade a warm farewell to\n      Torpenhow at the station.",
                "\"I am going to lie up for a while and rest,\" said Torpenhow. \"I don't know\n      where I shall live in London, but if God brings us to meet, we shall meet.\n      Are you staying here on the off-chance of another row? There will be none\n      till the Southern Soudan is reoccupied by our troops. Mark that. Goodbye;\n      bless you; come back when your money's spent; and give me your address.\"",
                "Dick loitered in Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, and Port Said, -- especially\n      Port Said. There is iniquity in many parts of the world, and vice in all,\n      but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the vices in\n      all the continents finds itself at Port Said. And through the heart of\n      that sand-bordered hell, where the mirage flickers day long above the\n      Bitter Lake, move, if you will only wait, most of the men and women you\n      have known in this life. Dick established himself in quarters more riotous\n      than respectable. He spent his evenings on the quay, and boarded many\n      ships, and saw very many friends, -- gracious Englishwomen with whom he\n      had talked not too wisely in the veranda of Shepherd's Hotel, hurrying war\n      correspondents, skippers of the contract troop-ships employed in the\n      campaign, army officers by the score, and others of less reputable trades.",
                "He had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies, and the\n      advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong excitement,\n      at the gaming-tables, saloons, dancing-hells, and elsewhere. For\n      recreation there was the straight vista of the Canal, the blazing sands,\n      the procession of shipping, and the white hospitals where the English\n      soldiers lay. He strove to set down in black and white and colour all that\n      Providence sent him, and when that supply was ended sought about for fresh\n      material. It was a fascinating employment, but it ran away with his money,\n      and he had drawn in advance the hundred and twenty pounds to which he was\n      entitled yearly. \"Now I shall have to work and starve!\" thought he, and\n      was addressing himself to this new fate when a mysterious telegram arrived\n      from Torpenhow in England, which said, \"Come back, quick; you have caught\n      on. Come.\"",
                "A large smile overspread his face. \"So soon! that's a good hearing,\" said\n      he to himself. \"There will be an orgy tonight. I'll stand or fall by my\n      luck. Faith, it's time it came!\" He deposited half of his funds in the\n      hands of his well-known friends Monsieur and Madame Binat, and ordered\n      himself a Zanzibar dance of the finest. Monsieur Binat was shaking with\n      drink, but Madame smiles sympathetically -- \"Monsieur needs a chair, of\n      course, and of course Monsieur will sketch; Monsieur amuses himself\n      strangely.\"",
                "Binat raised a blue-white face from a cot in the inner room. \"I\n      understand,\" he quavered. \"We all know Monsieur. Monsieur is an artist, as\n      I have been.\" Dick nodded. \"In the end,\" said Binat, with gravity,\n      \"Monsieur will descend alive into hell, as I have descended.\" And he\n      laughed.",
                "\"You must come to the dance, too,\" said Dick; \"I shall want you.\"",
                "\"For my face? I knew it would be so. For my face? My God! and for my\n      degradation so tremendous! I will not. Take him away. He is a devil. Or at\n      least do thou, Celeste, demand of him more.\" The excellent Binat began to\n      kick and scream.",
                "\"All things are for sale in Port Said,\" said Madame. \"If my husband comes\n      it will be so much more. Eh, how you call 'alf a sovereign.\"",
                "The money was paid, and the mad dance was held at night in a walled\n      courtyard at the back of Madame Binat's house. The lady herself, in faded\n      mauve silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders, played the\n      piano, and to the tin-pot music of a Western waltz the naked Zanzibari\n      girls danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps. Binat sat upon a\n      chair and stared with eyes that saw nothing, till the whirl of the dance\n      and the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the\n      place of blood in his veins, and his face glistened. Dick took him by the\n      chin brutally and turned that face to the light. Madame Binat looked over\n      her shoulder and smiled with many teeth. Dick leaned against the wall and\n      sketched for an hour, till the kerosene lamps began to smell, and the\n      girls threw themselves panting on the hard-beaten ground. Then he shut his\n      book with a snap and moved away, Binat plucking feebly at his elbow. \"Show\n      me,\" he whimpered. \"I too was once an artist, even I!\" Dick showed him the\n      rough sketch. \"Am I that?\" he screamed. \"Will you take that away with you\n      and show all the world that it is I, -- Binat?\" He moaned and wept.",
                "\"Monsieur has paid for all,\" said Madame. \"To the pleasure of seeing\n      Monsieur again.\"",
                "The courtyard gate shut, and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the\n      nearest gambling-hell, where he was well known. \"If the luck holds, it's\n      an omen; if I lose, I must stay here.\" He placed his money picturesquely\n      about the board, hardly daring to look at what he did. The luck held.",
                "Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds, and he went\n      down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed\n      cargo-steamer, who landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket\n      than he cared to think about.",
                "A thin gray fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for\n      summer was in England.",
                "\"It's a cheerful wilderness, and it hasn't the knack of altering much,\"\n       Dick thought, as he tramped from the Docks westward. \"Now, what must I\n      do?\"",
                "The packed houses gave no answer. Dick looked down the long lightless\n      streets and at the appalling rush of traffic. \"Oh, you rabbit-hutches!\"\n       said he, addressing a row of highly respectable semi-detached residences.\n      \"Do you know what you've got to do later on? You have to supply me with\n      men-servants and maid-servants,\" -- here he smacked his lips, -- \"and\n      the peculiar treasure of kings. Meantime I'll clothes and boots, and\n      presently I will return and trample on you.\" He stepped forward\n      energetically; he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the side. As he\n      stooped to make investigations, a man jostled him into the gutter. \"All\n      right,\" he said. \"That's another nick in the score. I'll jostle you later\n      on.\"",
                "Good clothes and boots are not cheap, and Dick left his last shop with the\n      certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time, but with only\n      fifty shillings in his pocket. He returned to streets by the Docks, and\n      lodged himself in one room, where the sheets on the bed were almost\n      audibly marked in case of theft, and where nobody seemed to go to bed at\n      all. When his clothes arrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate for\n      Torpenhow's address, and got it, with the intimation that there was still\n      some money waiting for him.",
                "\"How much?\" said Dick, as one who habitually dealt in millions.",
                "\"Between thirty and forty pounds. If it would be any convenience to you,\n      of course we could let you have it at once; but we usually settle accounts\n      monthly.\"",
                "\"If I show that I want anything now, I'm lost,\" he said to himself. \"All I\n      need I'll take later on.\" Then, aloud, \"It's hardly worth while; and I'm\n      going to the country for a month, too. Wait till I come back, and I'll see\n      about it.\"",
                "\"But we trust, Mr. Heldar, that you do not intend to sever your\nconnection with us?\"\n\n Dick's business in life was the study of faces, and he watched the speaker\nkeenly. \"That man means something,\" he said. \"I'll do no business till\nI've seen Torpenhow. There's a big deal coming.\" So he departed, making\nno promises, to his one little room by the Docks. And that day was\nthe seventh of the month, and that month, he reckoned with awful\ndistinctness, had thirty-one days in it! It is not easy for a man of\ncatholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twenty-four days on\nfifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in\nall the loneliness of London. Dick paid seven shillings a week for his\nlodging, which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and\ndrink. Naturally, his first purchase was of the materials of his craft;\nhe had been without them too long. Half a day's investigations and\ncomparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed\npotatoes, twopence a plate, were the best food. Now, sausages once or\ntwice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant. As lunch, even, with\nmashed potatoes, they become monotonous. At dinner they are impertinent.\nAt the end of three days Dick loathed sausages, and, going, forth,\npawned his watch to revel on sheep's head, which is not as cheap as it\nlooks, owing to the bones and the gravy. Then he returned to sausages\nand mashed potatoes. Then he confined himself entirely to mashed\npotatoes for a day, and was unhappy because of pain in his inside. Then\nhe pawned his waistcoat and his tie, and thought regretfully of money\nthrown away in times past. There are few things more edifying unto\nArt than the actual belly-pinch of hunger, and Dick in his few walks\nabroad, -- he did not care for exercise; it raised desires that could not\nbe satisfied -- found himself dividing mankind into two classes, -- those\nwho looked as if they might give him something to eat, and those who\nlooked otherwise. \"I never knew what I had to learn about the human\nface before,\" he thought; and, as a reward for his humility, Providence\ncaused a cab-driver at a sausage-shop where Dick fed that night to leave\nhalf eaten a great chunk of bread. Dick took it, -- would have fought all\nthe world for its possession, -- and it cheered him.",
                "The month dragged through at last, and, nearly prancing with impatience,\n      he went to draw his money. Then he hastened to Torpenhow's address and\n      smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers.\n      Torpenhow was on the top floor, and Dick burst into his room, to be\n      received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs, as Torpenhow dragged\n      him to the light and spoke of twenty different things in the same breath.",
                "\"But you're looking tucked up,\" he concluded.",
                "\"Got anything to eat?\" said Dick, his eye roaming round the room.",
                "\"I shall be having breakfast in a minute. What do you say to sausages?\"",
                "\"No, anything but sausages! Torp, I've been starving on that accursed\n      horse-flesh for thirty days and thirty nights.\"",
                "\"Now, what lunacy has been your latest?\"",
                "Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech. Then he opened his\n      coat; there was no waistcoat below. \"I ran it fine, awfully fine, but I've\n      just scraped through.\"",
                "\"You haven't much sense, but you've got a backbone, anyhow. Eat, and talk\n      afterwards.\" Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could gorge\n      no more. Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe, and he smoked as men smoke\n      who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco.",
                "\"Ouf!\" said he. \"That's heavenly! Well?\"",
                "\"Why in the world didn't you come to me?\"",
                "\"Couldn't; I owe you too much already, old man. Besides I had a sort of\n      superstition that this temporary starvation -- that's what it was, and\n      it hurt -- would bring me luck later. It's over and done with now, and\n      none of the syndicate know how hard up I was. Fire away. What's the exact\n      state of affairs as regards myself?\"",
                "\"You had my wire? You've caught on here. People like your work immensely.\n      I don't know why, but they do. They say you have a fresh touch and a new\n      way of drawing things. And, because they're chiefly home-bred English,\n      they say you have insight. You're wanted by half a dozen papers; you're\n      wanted to illustrate books.\"",
                "Dick grunted scornfully.",
                "\"You're wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the\n      dealers. They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment.\n      Good Lord! who can account for the fathomless folly of the public?\"",
                "\"They're a remarkably sensible people.\"",
                "\"They are subject to fits, if that's what you mean; and you happen to be\n      the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they\n      call Art. Just now you're a fashion, a phenomenon, or whatever you please.\n      I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you here, and I\n      have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me\n      from time to time. Those coming after your work on the Central Southern\n      Syndicate appear to have done your business. You're in luck.\"",
                "\"Huh! call it luck! Do call it luck, when a man has been kicking about the\n      world like a dog, waiting for it to come! I'll luck 'em later on. I want a\n      place to work first.\"",
                "\"Come here,\" said Torpenhow, crossing the landing. \"This place is a big\n      box room really, but it will do for you. There's your skylight, or your\n      north light, or whatever window you call it, and plenty of room to thrash\n      about in, and a bedroom beyond. What more do you need?\"",
                "\"Good enough,\" said Dick, looking round the large room that took up a\n      third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames. A\n      pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the\n      place. Three steps led from the door to the landing, and three more to\n      Torpenhow's room. The well of the staircase disappeared into darkness,\n      pricked by tiny gas-jets, and there were sounds of men talking and doors\n      slamming seven flights below, in the warm gloom.",
                "\"Do they give you a free hand here?\" said Dick, cautiously. He was Ishmael\n      enough to know the value of liberty.",
                "\"Anything you like; latch-keys and license unlimited. We are permanent\n      tenants for the most part here. 'Tisn't a place I would recommend for a\n      Young Men's Christian Association, but it will serve. I took these rooms\n      for you when I wired.\"",
                "\"You're a great deal too kind, old man.\"",
                "\"You didn't suppose you were going away from me, did you?\" Torpenhow put\n      his hand on Dick's shoulder, and the two walked up and down the room,\n      henceforward to be called the studio, in sweet and silent communion. They\n      heard rapping at Torpenhow's door. \"That's some ruffian come up for a\n      drink,\" said Torpenhow; and he raised his voice cheerily. There entered no\n      one more ruffianly than a portly middle-aged gentleman in a satin-faced\n      frockcoat. His lips were parted and pale, and there were deep pouches\n      under the eyes.",
                "\"Weak heart,\" said Dick to himself, and, as he shook hands, \"very weak\n      heart. His pulse is shaking his fingers.\"",
                "The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate\n      and \"one of the most ardent admirers of your work, Mr. Heldar. I assure\n      you, in the name of the syndicate, that we are immensely indebted to you;\n      and I trust, Mr. Heldar, you won't forget that we were largely\n      instrumental in bringing you before the public.\" He panted because of the\n      seven flights of stairs.",
                "Dick glanced at Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his\n      cheek.",
                "\"I shan't forget,\" said Dick, every instinct of defence roused in him.",
                "\"You've paid me so well that I couldn't, you know. By the way, when I am\n      settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches. There\n      must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you.\"",
                "\"That is er -- is what I came to speak about. I fear we can't allow it\n      exactly, Mr. Heldar. In the absence of any specified agreement, the\n      sketches are our property, of course.\"",
                "\"Do you mean to say that you are going to keep them?\"",
                "\"Yes; and we hope to have your help, on your own terms, Mr. Heldar, to\n      assist us in arranging a little exhibition, which, backed by our name and\n      the influence we naturally command among the press, should be of material\n      service to you. Sketches such as yours --  -- \"",
                "\"Belong to me. You engaged me by wire, you paid me the lowest rates you\n      dared. You can't mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they're all I've\n      got in the world!\"",
                "Torpenhow watched Dick's face and whistled.",
                "Dick walked up and down, thinking. He saw the whole of his little stock in\n      trade, the first weapon of his equipment, annexed at the outset of his\n      campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught aright,\n      who said that he represented a syndicate, which was a thing for which Dick\n      had not the least reverence. The injustice of the proceedings did not much\n      move him; he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in other places to\n      be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong.",
                "But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat, and\n      when he spoke again, it was with a strained sweetness that Torpenhow knew\n      well for the beginning of strife.",
                "\"Forgive me, sir, but you have no -- no younger man who can arrange\n      this business with me?\"",
                "\"I speak for the syndicate. I see no reason for a third party to --  -- \"",
                "\"You will in a minute. Be good enough to give back my sketches.\"",
                "The man stared blankly at Dick, and then at Torpenhow, who was leaning\n      against the wall. He was not used to ex-employees who ordered him to be\n      good enough to do things.",
                "\"Yes, it is rather a cold-blooded steal,\" said Torpenhow, critically; \"but\n      I'm afraid, I am very much afraid, you've struck the wrong man. Be\n      careful, Dick; remember, this isn't the Soudan.\"",
                "\"Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your\n      name before the world --  -- \"",
                "This was not a fortunate remark; it reminded Dick of certain vagrant years\n      lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires. The memory did\n      not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the\n      fruit of those years.",
                "\"I don't know quite what to do with you,\" began Dick, meditatively. \"Of\n      course you're a thief, and you ought to be half killed, but in your case\n      you'd probably die. I don't want you dead on this floor, and, besides,\n      it's unlucky just as one's moving in. Don't hit, sir; you'll only excite\n      yourself.\"",
                "He put one hand on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump body\n      beneath the coat. \"My goodness!\" said he to Torpenhow, \"and this gray oaf\n      dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh camel-driver have the black hide\n      taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates, and\n      he was as tough as whipcord. This thing's soft all over -- like a\n      woman.\"",
                "There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a\n      man who does not intend to strike. The head of the syndicate began to\n      breathe heavily. Dick walked round him, pawing him, as a cat paws a soft\n      hearth-rug. Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches\n      underneath the eyes, and shook his head. \"You were going to steal my\n      things, -- mine, mine, mine! -- you, who don't know when you may\n      die. Write a note to your office, -- you say you're the head of it, -- and\n      order them to give Torpenhow my sketches, -- every one of them. Wait a\n      minute: your hand's shaking. Now!\" He thrust a pocket-book before him. The\n      note was written. Torpenhow took it and departed without a word, while\n      Dick walked round and round the spellbound captive, giving him such advice\n      as he conceived best for the welfare of his soul. When Torpenhow returned\n      with a gigantic portfolio, he heard Dick say, almost soothingly, \"Now, I\n      hope this will be a lesson to you; and if you worry me when I have settled\n      down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault, believe me, I'll\n      catch you and manhandle you, and you'll die. You haven't very long to\n      live, anyhow. Go! Imshi, Vootsak, -- get out!\" The man departed,\n      staggering and dazed. Dick drew a long breath: \"Phew! what a lawless lot\n      these people are! The first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery,\n      organised burglary! Think of the hideous blackness of that man's mind! Are\n      my sketches all right, Torp?\"",
                "\"Yes; one hundred and forty-seven of them. Well, I must say, Dick, you've\n      begun well.\"",
                "\"He was interfering with me. It only meant a few pounds to him, but it was\n      everything to me. I don't think he'll bring an action. I gave him some\n      medical advice gratis about the state of his body. It was cheap at the\n      little flurry it cost him. Now, let's look at my things.\"",
                "Two minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep\n      in the portfolio, chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and\n      thought of the price at which they had been bought.",
                "The afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw\n      Dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight.",
                "\"I builded better than I knew, Torp,\" he said, without stopping the dance.\n      \"They're good! They're damned good! They'll go like flame! I shall have an\n      exhibition of them on my own brazen hook. And that man would have cheated\n      me out of it! Do you know that I'm sorry now that I didn't actually hit\n      him?\"",
                "\"Go out,\" said Torpenhow, -- \"go out and pray to be delivered from the\n      sin of arrogance, which you never will be. Bring your things up from\n      whatever place you're staying in, and we'll try to make this barn a little\n      more shipshape.\"",
                "\"And then -- oh, then,\" said Dick, still capering, \"we will spoil the\n      Egyptians!\""

They rose from a\n      wreck of oddments that began with felt-covered water-bottles, belts, and\n      regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of second-hand uniforms and\n      a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a\n      military model had just gone away. The watery autumn sunlight was falling,\n      and shadows sat in the corners of the studio.",

I found out, later, that the man had been as far as Brighton\n      beach; but he knew all about Art, confound him.

Well, I lured my model, a beautiful rifleman, up here\n      with drink; I drored him, and I redrored him, and I redrored him, and I\n      made him a flushed, dishevelled, bedevilled scallawag, with his helmet at\n      the back of his head, and the living fear of death in his eye, and the\n      blood oozing out of a cut over his ankle-bone.

It was brutal and coarse and violent, -- man being naturally\n      gentle when he's fighting for his life. They wanted something more\n      restful, with a little more colour. I could have said a good deal, but you\n      might as well talk to a sheep as an art-manager. I took my 'Last Shot'\n      back. Behold the result! I put him into a lovely red coat without a speck\n      on it. That is Art. I polished his boots, -- observe the high light on\n      the toe. That is Art. I cleaned his rifle, -- rifles are always clean\n      on service, -- because that is Art. I pipeclayed his helmet, -- pipeclay\n      is always used on active service, and is indispensable to Art. I shaved\n      his chin, I washed his hands, and gave him an air of fatted peace. Result,\n      military tailor's pattern-plate.

Dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of the\n      tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low tide. A\n      girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly, \"Ah, get away, you\n      beast!\" and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog drove across\n      Dick's face the black smoke of a river-steamer at her berth below the\n      wall. He was blinded for the moment, then spun round and found himself\n      face to face with -- Maisie.",
                "There was no mistaking. The years had turned the child to a woman, but\n      they had not altered the dark-gray eyes, the thin scarlet lips, or the\n      firmly modelled mouth and chin; and, that all should be as it was of old,\n      she wore a closely fitting gray dress.",
                "Since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own command,\n      Dick, advancing, said \"Halloo!\" after the manner of schoolboys, and Maisie\n      answered, \"Oh, Dick, is that you?\" Then, against his will, and before the\n      brain newly released from considerations of the cash balance had time to\n      dictate to the nerves, every pulse of Dick's body throbbed furiously and\n      his palate dried in his mouth. The fog shut down again, and Maisie's face\n      was pearl-white through it. No word was spoken, but Dick fell into step at\n      her side, and the two paced the Embankment together, keeping the step as\n      perfectly as in their afternoon excursions to the mud-flats. Then Dick, a\n      little hoarsely -- \"What has happened to Amomma?\"",
                "\"He died, Dick. Not cartridges; over-eating. He was always greedy. Isn't\n      it funny?\"",

                "From the beginning he told the tale, the I -- I -- I's flashing\n      through the records as telegraph-poles fly past the traveller. Maisie\n      listened and nodded her head.

                "\"I'm at your orders; forgive me.\" Dick devoured the troubled little face\n      with his eyes. There was triumph in them, because he could not conceive\n      that Maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him, since he loved her.",
                "\"It's wrong of me,\" said Maisie, more slowly than before; \"it's wrong and\n      selfish; but, oh, I've been so lonely! No, you misunderstand. Now I've\n      seen you again, -- it's absurd, but I want to keep you in my life.\"",
                "\"Naturally. We belong.\"",
                "\"We don't; but you always understood me, and there is so much in my work\n      that you could help me in. You know things and the ways of doing things.\n      You must.\"",
                "\"I do, I fancy, or else I don't know myself. Then you won't care to lose\n      sight of me altogether, and -- you want me to help you in your work?\"",
                "\"Yes; but remember, Dick, nothing will ever come of it. That's why I feel\n      so selfish. Can't things stay as they are? I do want your help.\"",
                "\"You shall have it. But let's consider. I must see your pics first, and\n      overhaul your sketches, and find out about your tendencies. You should see\n      what the papers say about my tendencies! Then I'll give you good advice,\n      and you shall paint according. Isn't that it, Maisie?\"",
                "Again there was triumph in Dick's eye.",
                "\"It's too good of you, -- much too good. Because you are consoling\n      yourself with what will never happen, and I know that, and yet I want to\n      keep you. Don't blame me later, please.\"",
                "\"I'm going into the matter with my eyes open. Moreover the Queen can do no\n      wrong. It isn't your selfishness that impresses me. It's your audacity in\n      proposing to make use of me.\"",
                "\"Pooh! You're only Dick, -- and a print-shop.\"",
                "\"Very good: that's all I am. But, Maisie, you believe, don't you, that I\n      love you? I don't want you to have any false notions about brothers and\n      sisters.\"",
                "Maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes.",
                "\"It's absurd, but -- I believe. I wish I could send you away before you\n      get angry with me. But -- but the girl that lives with me is\n      red-haired, and an impressionist, and all our notions clash.\"",
                "\"So do ours, I think. Never mind. Three months from today we shall be\n      laughing at this together.\"",
                "Maisie shook her head mournfully. \"I knew you wouldn't understand, and it\n      will only hurt you more when you find out. Look at my face, Dick, and tell\n      me what you see.\"",
                "They stood up and faced each other for a moment. The fog was gathering,\n      and it stifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings. Dick\n      brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes,\n      mouth, and chin underneath the black velvet toque.",
                "\"It's the same Maisie, and it's the same me,\" he said. \"We've both nice\n      little wills of our own, and one or other of us has to be broken. Now\n      about the future. I must come and see your pictures some day, -- I\n      suppose when the red-haired girl is on the premises.\"",
                "\"Sundays are my best times. You must come on Sundays. There are such heaps\n      of things I want to talk about and ask your advice about. Now I must get\n      back to work.\"",
                "\"Try to find out before next Sunday what I am,\" said Dick. \"Don't take my\n      word for anything I've told you. Good-bye, darling, and bless you.\"",
                "Maisie stole away like a little gray mouse. Dick watched her till she was\n      out of sight, but he did not hear her say to herself, very soberly, \"I'm a\n      wretch, -- a horrid, selfish wretch. But it's Dick, and Dick will\n      understand.\"",
                "No one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force\n      meets the immovable post, though many have thought deeply, even as Dick\n      thought. He tried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in a few\n      weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of thinking. Then\n      he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that was written on it.",
                "\"If I know anything of heads,\" he said, \"there's everything in that face\n      but love. I shall have to put that in myself; and that chin and mouth\n      won't be won for nothing. But she's right. She knows what she wants, and\n      she's going to get it. What insolence! Me! Of all the people in the wide\n      world, to use me! But then she's Maisie. There's no getting over that\n      fact; and it's good to see her again. This business must have been\n      simmering at the back of my head for years.... She'll use me as I used\n      Binat at Port Said. She's quite right. It will hurt a little. I shall have\n      to see her every Sunday, -- like a young man courting a housemaid.\n      She's sure to come around; and yet -- that mouth isn't a yielding\n      mouth. I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time, and I shall have to\n      look at her pictures, -- I don't even know what sort of work she does\n      yet, -- and I shall have to talk about Art, -- Woman's Art!\n      Therefore, particularly and perpetually, damn all varieties of Art. It did\n      me a good turn once, and now it's in my way. I'll go home and do some\n      Art.\"",
                "Half-way to the studio, Dick was smitten with a terrible thought. The\n      figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it.",
                "\"She's all alone in London, with a red-haired impressionist girl, who\n      probably has the digestion of an ostrich. Most red-haired people have.\n      Maisie's a bilious little body. They'll eat like lone women, -- meals\n      at all hours, and tea with all meals. I remember how the students in Paris\n      used to pig along. She may fall ill at any minute, and I shan't be able to\n      help. Whew! this is ten times worse than owning a wife.\"",
                "Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk, and looked at Dick with eyes full of\n      the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same\n      oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil.\n      This is a good love, and, since it allows, and even encourages, strife,\n      recrimination, and brutal sincerity, does not die, but grows, and is proof\n      against any absence and evil conduct.",
                "Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council. He\n      thought of Maisie and her possible needs. It was a new thing to think of\n      anybody but Torpenhow, who could think for himself. Here at last was an\n      outlet for that cash balance. He could adorn Maisie barbarically with\n      jewelry, -- a thick gold necklace round that little neck, bracelets\n      upon the rounded arms, and rings of price upon her hands, -- the cool,\n      temperate, ringless hands that he had taken between his own. It was an\n      absurd thought, for Maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on one\n      finger, and she would laugh at golden trappings. It would be better to sit\n      with her quietly in the dusk, his arm around her neck and her face on his\n      shoulder, as befitted husband and wife. Torpenhow's boots creaked that\n      night, and his strong voice jarred. Dick's brows contracted and he\n      murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a right and\n      part payment for past discomfort, and now he was checked in his stride by\n      a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly care for him.",
                "\"I say, old man,\" said Torpenhow, who had made one or two vain attempts at\n      conversation, \"I haven't put your back up by anything I've said lately,\n      have I?\"",
                "\"You! No. How could you?\"",
                "\"Liver out of order?\"",
                "\"The truly healthy man doesn't know he has a liver. I'm only a bit worried\n      about things in general. I suppose it's my soul.\"",
                "\"The truly healthy man doesn't know he has a soul. What business have you\n      with luxuries of that kind?\"",
                "\"It came of itself. Who's the man that says that we're all islands\n      shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?\"",
                "\"He's right, whoever he is, -- except about the misunderstanding. I\n      don't think we could misunderstand each other.\"",
                "The blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds. Then Torpenhow,\n      insinuatingly -- \"Dick, is it a woman?\"",
                "\"Be hanged if it's anything remotely resembling a woman; and if you begin\n      to talk like that, I'll hire a red-brick studio with white paint\n      trimmings, and begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among\n      three-and-sixpenny pot-palms, and I'll mount all my pics in aniline-dye\n      plush plasters, and I'll invite every woman who maunders over what her\n      guide-books tell her is Art, and you shall receive 'em, Torp, -- in a\n      snuff-brown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie. You'll\n      like that?\"",
                "\"Too thin, Dick. A better man than you once denied with cursing and\n      swearing. You've overdone it, just as he did. It's no business of mine, of\n      course, but it's comforting to think that somewhere under the stars\n      there's saving up for you a tremendous thrashing. Whether it'll come from\n      heaven or earth, I don't know, but it's bound to come and break you up a\n      little. You want hammering.\"",
                "Dick shivered. \"All right,\" said he. \"When this island is disintegrated,\n      it will call for you.\"",
                "\"I shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more.\n      We're talking nonsense. Come along to a theatre.\""

                "Some weeks later, on a very foggy Sunday, Dick was returning across the\n      Park to his studio. \"This,\" he said, \"is evidently the thrashing that Torp\n      meant. It hurts more than I expected; but the Queen can do no wrong; and\n      she certainly has some notion of drawing.\"",
                "He had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisie, -- always under the\n      green eyes of the red-haired impressionist girl, whom he learned to hate\n      at sight, -- and was tingling with a keen sense of shame. Sunday after\n      Sunday, putting on his best clothes, he had walked over to the untidy\n      house north of the Park, first to see Maisie's pictures, and then to\n      criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions\n      on which advice would not be wasted. Sunday after Sunday, and his love\n      grew with each visit, he had been compelled to cram his heart back from\n      between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie several times and\n      very much indeed. Sunday after Sunday, the head above the heart had warned\n      him that Maisie was not yet attainable, and that it would be better to\n      talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the craft that was\n      all in all to her. Therefore it was his fate to endure weekly torture in\n      the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a frail stuffy little\n      villa where nothing was ever in its right place and nobody every called, -- to\n      endure and to watch Maisie moving to and fro with the teacups. He abhorred\n      tea, but, since it gave him a little longer time in her presence, he drank\n      it devoutly, and the red-haired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him\n      without speaking. She was always watching him.",
                "Once, and only once, when she had left the studio, Maisie showed him an\n      album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers, -- the\n      briefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying\n      exhibitions. Dick stooped and kissed the paint-smudged thumb on the open\n      page. \"Oh, my love, my love,\" he muttered, \"do you value these things?\n      Chuck 'em into the waste-paper basket!\"",
                "\"Not till I get something better,\" said Maisie, shutting the book.",
                "Then Dick, moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for\n      the maiden, did deliberately propose, in order to secure more of these\n      coveted cuttings, that he should paint a picture which Maisie should sign.",
                "\"That's childish,\" said Maisie, \"and I didn't think it of you. It must be\n      my work. Mine, -- mine, -- mine!\"",
                "\"Go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers' houses. You are\n      thoroughly good at that.\" Dick was sick and savage.",
                "\"Better things than medallions, Dick,\" was the answer, in tones that\n      recalled a gray-eyed atom's fearless speech to Mrs. Jennett. Dick would\n      have abased himself utterly, but that other girl trailed in.",
                "Next Sunday he laid at Maisie's feet small gifts of pencils that could\n      almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed, and\n      he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand. It demanded, among\n      other things, an exposition of the faith that was in him.",
                "Torpenhow's hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with\n      which Dick preached his own gospel of Art.",
                "A month before, Dick would have been equally astonished; but it was\n      Maisie's will and pleasure, and he dragged his words together to make\n      plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys\n      and wherefores of work. There is not the least difficulty in doing a thing\n      if you only know how to do it; the trouble is to explain your method.",
                "\"I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand,\" said Dick,\n      despairingly, over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would\n      not \"look flesh,\" -- it was the same chin that she had scraped out with\n      the palette knife, -- \"but I find it almost impossible to teach you.\n      There's a queer grim Dutch touch about your painting that I like; but I've\n      a notion that you're weak in drawing. You foreshorten as though you never\n      used the model, and you've caught Kami's pasty way of dealing with flesh\n      in shadow. Then, again, though you don't know it yourself, you shirk hard\n      work. Suppose you spend some of your time on line lone. Line doesn't allow\n      of shirking. Oils do, and three square inches of flashy, tricky stuff in\n      the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing off, -- as I know.\n      That's immoral. Do line-work for a little while, and then I can tell more\n      about your powers, as old Kami used to say.\"",
                "Maisie protested; she did not care for the pure line.",
                "\"I know,\" said Dick. \"You want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of\n      flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling.\" The red-haired\n      girl laughed a little. \"You want to do landscapes with cattle knee-deep in\n      grass to hide bad drawing. You want to do a great deal more than you can\n      do. You have sense of colour, but you want form. Colour's a gift, -- put\n      it aside and think no more about it, -- but form you can be drilled\n      into. Now, all your fancy heads -- and some of them are very good -- will\n      keep you exactly where you are. With line you must go forward or backward,\n      and it will show up all your weaknesses.\"",
                "\"But other people --  -- \" began Maisie.",
                "\"You mustn't mind what other people do. If their souls were your soul, it\n      would be different. You stand and fall by your own work, remember, and\n      it's waste of time to think of any one else in this battle.\"",
                "Dick paused, and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came\n      back into his eyes. He looked at Maisie, and the look asked as plainly as\n      words, Was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and\n      counsel and join hands with Life and Love? Maisie assented to the new\n      programme of schooling so adorably that Dick could hardly restrain himself\n      from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the nearest\n      registrar's office. It was the implicit obedience to the spoken word and\n      the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and buffeted\n      his soul. He held authority in that house, -- authority limited,\n      indeed, to one-half of one afternoon in seven, but very real while it\n      lasted. Maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects, from the\n      proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney. The\n      red-haired girl never consulted him about anything.",
                "On the other hand, she accepted his appearances without protest, and\n      watched him always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment were\n      irregular and fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles, and\n      biscuit, as he had suspected from the beginning. The girls were supposed\n      to market week and week about, but they lived, with the help of a\n      charwoman, as casually as the young ravens. Maisie spent most of her\n      income on models, and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined as\n      her work was rough. Armed with knowledge, dear-bought from the Docks, Dick\n      warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation meant the crippling of power\n      to work, which was considerably worse than death.",
                "Maisie took the warning, and gave more thought to what she ate and drank.\n      When his trouble returned upon him, as it generally did in the long winter\n      twilights, the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and\n      his coercion with a hearth-brush of the smoky drawing-room chimney stung\n      Dick like a whip-lash.",
                "He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings, till\n      one Sunday, the red-haired girl announced that she would make a study of\n      Dick's head, and that he would be good enough to sit still, and -- quite\n      as an afterthought -- look at Maisie. He sat, because he could not well\n      refuse, and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people\n      in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft. He\n      remembered Binat most distinctly, -- that Binat who had once been an\n      artist and talked about degradation.",
                "It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head, but it presented the\n      dumb waiting, the longing, and, above all, the hopeless enslavement of the\n      man, in a spirit of bitter mockery.",
                "\"I'll buy it,\" said Dick, promptly, \"at your own price.\"",
                "\"My price is too high, but I dare say you'll be as grateful if --  -- \"\n       The wet sketch, fluttered from the girl's hand and fell into the ashes of\n      the studio stove. When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged.",
                "\"Oh, it's all spoiled!\" said Maisie. \"And I never saw it. Was it like?\"",
                "\"Thank you,\" said Dick under his breath to the red-haired girl, and he\n      removed himself swiftly.",
                "\"How that man hates me!\" said the girl. \"And how he loves you, Maisie!\"",
                "\"What nonsense? I knew Dick's very fond of me, but he had his work to do,\n      and I have mine.\"",
                "\"Yes, he is fond of you, and I think he knows there is something in\n      impressionism, after all. Maisie, can't you see?\"",
                "\"See? See what?\"",
                "\"Nothing; only, I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that\n      man looks at you, I'd -- I don't know what I'd do. But he hates me. Oh,\n      how he hates me!\"",
                "She was not altogether correct. Dick's hatred was tempered with gratitude\n      for a few moments, and then he forgot the girl entirely. Only the sense of\n      shame remained, and he was nursing it across the Park in the fog.\n      \"There'll be an explosion one of these days,\" he said wrathfully. \"But it\n      isn't Maisie's fault; she's right, quite right, as far as she knows, and I\n      can't blame her. This business has been going on for three months nearly.\n      Three months! -- and it cost me ten years\" knocking about to get at the\n      notion, the merest raw notion, of my work. That's true; but then I didn't\n      have pins, drawing-pins, and palette-knives, stuck into me every Sunday.",
                "\"Oh, my little darling, if ever I break you, somebody will have a very bad\n      time of it. No, she won't. I'd be as big a fool about her as I am now.\n      I'll poison that red-haired girl on my wedding-day, -- she's\n      unwholesome, -- and now I'll pass on these present bad times to Torp.\"",
                "Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the sin\n      of levity, and Dick and listened and replied not a word. In the weeks\n      between the first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung himself\n      savagely into his work, resolved that Maisie should at least know the full\n      stretch of his powers. Then he had taught Maisie that she must not pay the\n      least attention to any work outside her own, and Maisie had obeyed him all\n      too well. She took his counsels, but was not interested in his pictures.",
                "\"Your things smell of tobacco and blood,\" she said once. \"Can't you do\n      anything except soldiers?\"",
                "\"I could do a head of you that would startle you,\" thought Dick, -- this\n      was before the red-haired girl had brought him under the guillotine, -- but\n      he only said, \"I am very sorry,\" and harrowed Torpenhow's soul that\n      evening with blasphemies against Art. Later, insensibly and to a large\n      extent against his own will, he ceased to interest himself in his own\n      work.",
                "For Maisie's sake, and to soothe the self-respect that it seemed to him he\n      lost each Sunday, he would not consciously turn out bad stuff, but, since\n      Maisie did not care even for his best, it were better not to do anything\n      at all save wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday. Torpenhow was\n      disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless, and then attacked him one Sunday\n      evening when Dick felt utterly exhausted after three hours' biting\n      self-restraint in Maisie's presence.

                "\"Surely you aren't taking all the stuff in the papers seriously?\" said the\n      Nilghai. \"Your vogue will be ended in less than six months, -- the\n      public will know your touch and go on to something new, -- and where\n      will you be then?\"",

                "\"Um!\" said Dick, pulling at his pipe.",
                "\"You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your\n      pictures? Just think how full an average man's life is of his own pursuits\n      and pleasures. When twenty thousand of him find time to look up between\n      mouthfuls and grunt something about something they aren't the least\n      interested in, the net result is called fame, reputation, or notoriety,\n      according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord.\"",

                "\"That's a bad sign,\" said the Nilghai, in an undertone.",
                "Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to\n      burn, and put a pillow behind the head. \"We can't help; we can't help,\" he\n      said. \"It's a good ugly sort of old cocoanut, and I'm fond of it.

                "Dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning. In the night-watches he\n      was overtaken with an idea, so simple and so luminous that he wondered he\n      had never conceived it before. It was full of craft. He would seek Maisie\n      on a week-day, -- would suggest an excursion, and would take her by\n      train to Fort Keeling, over the very ground that they two had trodden\n      together ten years ago.",
                "\"As a general rule,\" he explained to his chin-lathered reflection in the\n      morning, \"it isn't safe to cross an old trail twice.

                "Fortunately, the red-haired girl was out shopping when he arrived, and\n      Maisie in a paint-spattered blouse was warring with her canvas. She was\n      not pleased to see him; for week-day visits were a stretch of the bond;\n      and it needed all his courage to explain his errand.",
                "\"I know you've been working too hard,\" he concluded, with an air of\n      authority. \"If you do that, you'll break down. You had much better come.\"",
                "\"Where?\" said Maisie, wearily. She had been standing before her easel too\n      long, and was very tired.",
                "\"Anywhere you please. We'll take a train tomorrow and see where it stops.\n      We'll have lunch somewhere, and I'll bring you back in the evening.\"",

                "He strangled a wild desire to order a special train, but bought a great\n      gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten, and then retired into\n      himself to consider things.",
                "\"I'm going out for the day tomorrow with Dick,\" said Maisie to the\n      red-haired girl when the latter returned, tired, from marketing in the\n      Edgware road.",

                "\"There's nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly,\" she thought, \"but\n      I'm sure he'll be silly and worry me, and I'm sure I can't tell him\n      anything he'd like to hear. If he'd only be sensible, I should like him so\n      much better.\"",
                "Dick's eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning and\n      saw Maisie, gray-ulstered and black-velvet-hatted, standing in the\n      hallway. Palaces of marble, and not sordid imitation of grained wood, were\n      surely the fittest background for such a divinity. The red-haired girl\n      drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly.",
                "Maisie's eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead; she was altogether\n      unused to these demonstrations. \"Mind my hat,\" she said, hurrying away,\n      and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom.",

                "Maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply. The wind of a\n      keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks. Overhead, the\n      creamy-yellow smoke-clouds were thinning away one by one against a\n      pale-blue sky, and the improvident sparrows broke off from water-spout\n      committees and cab-rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring.",
                "\"It will be lovely weather in the country,\" said Dick.",

                "The stopped at Victoria, and Dick sought tickets. For less than half the\n      fraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie, comfortably settled by the\n      waiting-room fire, that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the\n      booking-office than to elbow one's own way through the crowd. Dick put her\n      into a Pullman, -- solely on account of the warmth there; and she\n      regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved\n      out into the country.",
                "\"I wish I knew where we are going,\" she repeated for the twentieth time.",
                "The name of a well-remembered station flashed by, towards the end of the\n      run, and Maisie was delighted.",

                "\"Yes. How she beat you for it! I never told it was you.\"",
                "\"She guessed. I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was\n      burying Amomma alive in the potatoes, and you believed me. You had a\n      trusting nature in those days.\"",
                "They laughed and leaned to look out, identifying ancient landmarks with\n      many reminiscences. Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie's\n      cheek, very near his own, and watched the blood rise under the clear skin.\n      He congratulated himself upon his cunning, and looked that the evening\n      would bring him a great reward.",
                "When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes.\n      First, but from a distance, they regarded the house of Mrs. Jennett.",
                "\"Suppose she should come out now, what would you do?\" said Dick, with mock\n      terror.",
                "\"I should make a face.\"",
                "\"Show, then,\" said Dick, dropping into the speech of childhood.",
                "Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa, and Dick\n      laughed.",
                "\"'This is disgraceful,'\" said Maisie, mimicking Mrs. Jennett's tone.\n      \"'Maisie, you run in at once, and learn the collect, gospel, and epistle\n      for the next three Sundays. After all I've taught you, too, and three\n      helps every Sunday at dinner! Dick's always leading you into mischief. If\n      you aren't a gentleman, Dick, you might at least...'\"",
                "The sentence ended abruptly. Maisie remembered when it had last been used.",
                "\"'Try to behave like one,'\" said Dick, promptly. \"Quite right. Now we'll\n      get some lunch and go on to Fort Keeling, -- unless you'd rather drive\n      there?\"",
                "\"We must walk, out of respect to the place. How little changed it all is!\"",
                "They turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets, and the\n      influence of old things lay upon them. Presently they passed a\n      confectioner's shop much considered in the days when their joint\n      pocket-money amounted to a shilling a week.",
                "\"Dick, have you any pennies?\" said Maisie, half to herself.",
                "\"Only three; and if you think you're going to have two of 'em to buy\n      peppermints with, you're wrong. She says peppermints aren't ladylike.\"",
                "Again they laughed, and again the colour came into Maisie's cheeks as the\n      blood boiled through Dick's heart. After a large lunch they went down to\n      the beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste, wind-bitten land that no\n      builder had thought it worth his while to defile. The winter breeze came\n      in from the sea and sang about their ears.",
                "\"Maisie,\" said Dick, \"your nose is getting a crude Prussian blue at the\n      tip. I'll race you as far as you please for as much as you please.\"",
                "She looked round cautiously, and with a laugh set off, swiftly as the\n      ulster allowed, till she was out of breath.",
                "\"We used to run miles,\" she panted. \"It's absurd that we can't run now.\"",
                "\"Old age, dear. This it is to get fat and sleek in town. When I wished to\n      pull your hair you generally ran for three miles, shrieking at the top of\n      your voice.

                "\"It's worse than anything I imagined,\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Oh, the everlasting Dick, I suppose! You fuss over him like a hen with\n      one chick. Let him run riot if he thinks it'll amuse him. You can whip a\n      young pup off feather, but you can't whip a young man.\"",
                "\"It isn't a woman. It's one woman; and it's a girl.\"",

                "The red-haired girl was lying down in her own room, staring at the\n      ceiling. The footsteps of people on the pavement sounded, as they grew\n      indistinct in the distance, like a many-times-repeated kiss that was all\n      one long kiss.

And the moonlight came\n      into Maisie's soul, so that she, usually reserved, chattered of herself\n      and of the things she took interest in, -- of Kami, wisest of teachers,\n      and of the girls in the studio, -- of the Poles, who will kill\n      themselves with overwork if they are not checked; of the French, who talk\n      at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish; of the\n      slovenly English, who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that\n      inclination does not imply power; of the Americans, whose rasping voices\n      in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tense-drawn nerves to\n      breaking-point, and whose suppers lead to indigestion; of tempestuous\n      Russians, neither to hold nor to bind, who tell the girls ghost-stories\n      till the girls shriek; of stolid Germans, who come to learn one thing,\n      and, having mastered that much, stolidly go away and copy pictures for\n      evermore.

The terminus stopped Dick in the midst of an eloquent\n      harangue on the beauties of exercise. He would buy Maisie a horse, -- such\n      a horse as never yet bowed head to bit, -- would stable it, with a\n      companion, some twenty miles from London, and Maisie, solely for her\n      health's sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week.",

                "He turned to walk home, meditating. The day had brought him nothing that\n      he hoped for, but -- surely this was worth many days -- it had\n      brought him nearer to Maisie. The end was only a question of time now, and\n      the prize well worth the waiting. By instinct, once more, he turned to the\n      river.",
                "\"And she understood at once,\" he said, looking at the water. \"She found\n      out my pet besetting sin on the spot, and paid it off. My God, how she\n      understood! And she said I was better than she was! Better than she was!\"\n       He laughed at the absurdity of the notion. \"I wonder if girls guess at\n      one-half a man's life. They can't, or -- they wouldn't marry us.\" He\n      took her gift out of his pocket, and considered it in the light of a\n      miracle and a pledge of the comprehension that, one day, would lead to\n      perfect happiness. Meantime, Maisie was alone in London, with none to save\n      her from danger. And the packed wilderness was very full of danger.",
                "Dick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the heathen\n      as he threw the piece of silver into the river. If any evil were to befal,\n      let him bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed, since the threepenny\n      piece was dearest to him of all his possessions. It was a small coin in\n      itself, but Maisie had given it, and the Thames held it, and surely the\n      Fates would be bribed for this once.",
                "The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie for\n      the moment. He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his\n      chambers with a strong yearning for some man-talk and tobacco after his\n      first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman. There\n      was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an\n      unsolicited vision of the Barralong dipping deep and sailing free for the\n      Southern Cross."

But the wider range of the Nilghai's body\n      and life attracted him most. When truth failed he fell back on fiction of\n      the wildest, and represented incidents in the Nilghai's career that were\n      unseemly, -- his marriages with many African princesses, his shameless\n      betrayal, for Arab wives, of an army corps to the Mahdi, his tattooment by\n      skilled operators in Burmah, his interview (and his fears) with the yellow\n      headsman in the blood-stained execution-ground of Canton, and finally, the\n      passings of his spirit into the bodies of whales, elephants, and toucans.\n      Torpenhow from time to time had added rhymed descriptions, and the whole\n      was a curious piece of art, because Dick decided, having regard to the\n      name of the book which being interpreted means \"naked,\" that it would be\n      wrong to draw the Nilghai with any clothes on, under any circumstances.\n      Consequently the last sketch, representing that much-enduring man calling\n      on the War Office to press his claims to the Egyptian medal, was hardly\n      delicate.

                "\"There's no pose in the matter at all. It's a fact. I was loafing from\n      Lima to Auckland in a big, old, condemned passenger-ship turned into a\n      cargo-boat and owned by a second-hand Italian firm. She was a crazy\n      basket. We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day, and we thought\n      ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her.

I hadn't anything to\n      do for weeks. The ship's charts were in pieces and our skipper daren't run\n      south for fear of catching a storm. So he did his best to knock all the\n      Society Islands out of the water one by one, and I went into the lower\n      deck, and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as I could\n      go. There was some brown paint and some green paint that they used for the\n      boats, and some black paint for ironwork, and that was all I had.\"",

It doesn't sound much, but when\n      there was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and creepy.\n      It was seven by fourteen feet, all done in shifting light for shifting\n      light.\"",

Whew! What a time that was!\"",
                "\"What happened after all?\"",
                "\"It all ended. They were loading her with wool when I left the ship, but\n      even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last. The eyes of the\n      demons scared them, I honestly believe.\"",

And the go-fever which is more real than many doctors'\n      diseases, waked and raged, urging him who loved Maisie beyond anything in\n      the world, to go away and taste the old hot, unregenerate life again, -- to\n      scuffle, swear, gamble, and love light loves with his fellows; to take\n      ship and know the sea once more, and by her beget pictures; to talk to\n      Binat among the sands of Port Said while Yellow Tina mixed the drinks; to\n      hear the crackle of musketry, and see the smoke roll outward, thin and\n      thicken again till the shining black faces came through, and in that hell\n      every man was strictly responsible for his own head, and his own alone,\n      and struck with an unfettered arm.

                "Now there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that\n      Dick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the Nilghai's life; when\n      that man, being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged to\n      the paper that employed him, had ridden over sunburned slippery grass in\n      the rear of Bredow's brigade on the day that the troopers flung themselves\n      at Caurobert's artillery, and for aught they knew twenty battalions in\n      front, to save the battered 24th German Infantry, to give time to decide\n      the fate of Vionville, and to learn ere their remnant came back to\n      Flavigay that cavalry can attack and crumple and break unshaken infantry.\n      Whenever he was inclined to think over a life that might have been better,\n      an income that might have been larger, and a soul that might have been\n      considerably cleaner, the Nilghai would comfort himself with the thought,\n      \"I rode with Bredow's brigade at Vionville,\" and take heart for any lesser\n      battle the next day might bring.",
                "\"I know,\" he said very gravely. \"I was always glad that you left it out.\"",
                "\"I left it out because Nilghai taught me what the Germany army learned\n      then, and what Schmidt taught their cavalry. I don't know German. What is\n      it? 'Take care of the time and the dressing will take care of itself.' I\n      must ride my own line to my own beat, old man.\"",
                "\"Tempe ist richtung. You've learned your lesson well,\" said the Nilghai.",

It hurts me a great deal more than\n      you know not to be able to go, but I cannot, that's all. I must do my own\n      work and live my own life in my own way, because I'm responsible for both.\n      Only don't think I frivol about it, Torp.

                "In his own room Dick was settling a question with himself -- and the\n      question was whether all the world, and all that was therein, and a\n      burning desire to exploit both, was worth one threepenny piece thrown into\n      the Thames.",

Once or twice he said something to Binkie about 'hermaphroditic\n      futilities,' but the little dog received so many confidences both from\n      Torpenhow and Dick that he did not trouble his tulip-ears to listen.",
                "Dick was permitted to see the girls off. They were going by the Dover\n      night-boat; and they hoped to return in August. It was then February, and\n      Dick felt that he was being hardly used. Maisie was so busy stripping the\n      small house across the Park, and packing her canvases, that she had not\n      time for thought. Dick went down to Dover and wasted a day there fretting\n      over a wonderful possibility. Would Maisie at the very last allow him one\n      small kiss? He reflected that he might capture her by the strong arm, as\n      he had seem women captured in the Southern Soudan, and lead her away; but\n      Maisie would never be led. She would turn her gray eyes upon him and say,\n      \"Dick, how selfish you are!\" Then his courage would fail him. It would be\n      better, after all, to beg for that kiss.",
                "Maisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the\n      night-mail on to the windy pier, in a gray waterproof and a little gray\n      cloth travelling-cap. The red-haired girl was not so lovely. Her green\n      eyes were hollow and her lips were dry. Dick saw the trunks aboard, and\n      went to Maisie's side in the darkness under the bridge. The mail-bags were\n      thundering into the forehold, and the red-haired girl was watching them.",
                "\"You'll have a rough passage tonight,\" said Dick. \"It's blowing outside. I\n      suppose I may come over and see you if I'm good?\"",
                "\"You mustn't. I shall be busy. At least, if I want you I'll send for you.\n      But I shall write from Vitry-sur-Marne. I shall have heaps of things to\n      consult you about. Oh, Dick, you have been so good to me! -- so good to\n      me!\"",
                "\"Thank you for that, dear. It hasn't made any difference, has it?\"",
                "\"I can't tell a fib. It hasn't -- in that way. But don't think I'm not\n      grateful.\"",
                "\"Damn the gratitude!\" said Dick, huskily, to the paddle-box.",
                "\"What's the use of worrying? You know I should ruin your life, and you'd\n      ruin mine, as things are now. You remember what you said when you were so\n      angry that day in the Park? One of us has to be broken. Can't you wait\n      till that day comes?\"",
                "\"No, love. I want you unbroken -- all to myself.\"",
                "Maisie shook her head. \"My poor Dick, what can I say!\"",
                "\"Don't say anything. Give me a kiss. Only one kiss, Maisie. I'll swear I\n      won't take any more. You might as well, and then I can be sure you're\n      grateful.\"",
                "Maisie put her cheek forward, and Dick took his reward in the darkness.",
                "It was only one kiss, but, since there was no time-limit specified, it was\n      a long one. Maisie wrenched herself free angrily, and Dick stood abashed\n      and tingling from head to toe.",
                "\"Goodbye, darling. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. Only -- keep\n      well and do good work, -- specially the Melancolia. I'm going to do\n      one, too. Remember me to Kami, and be careful what you drink. Country\n      drinking-water is bad everywhere, but it's worse in France. Write to me if\n      you want anything, and good-bye. Say good-bye to the whatever-you-call-um\n      girl, and -- can't I have another kiss? No. You're quite right.\n      Goodbye.\"",
                "A shout told him that it was not seemly to charge of the mail-bag incline.\n      He reached the pier as the steamer began to move off, and he followed her\n      with his heart.",
                "\"And there's nothing -- nothing in the wide world -- to keep us\n      apart except her obstinacy. These Calais night-boats are much too small.\n      I'll get Torp to write to the papers about it. She's beginning to pitch\n      already.\"",
                "Maisie stood where Dick had left her till she heard a little gasping cough\n      at her elbow. The red-haired girl's eyes were alight with cold flame.",
                "\"He kissed you!\" she said. \"How could you let him, when he wasn't anything\n      to you? How dared you to take a kiss from him? Oh, Maisie, let's go to the\n      ladies' cabin. I'm sick, -- deadly sick.\"",
                "\"We aren't into open water yet. Go down, dear, and I'll stay here. I don't\n      like the smell of the engines.... Poor Dick! He deserved one, -- only\n      one. But I didn't think he'd frighten me so.\"",
                "Dick returned to town next day just in time for lunch, for which he had\n      telegraphed. To his disgust, there were only empty plates in the studio.",
                "He lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairy-tale, and Torpenhow\n      entered, looking guilty.",
                "\"H'sh!\" said he. \"Don't make such a noise. I took it. Come into my rooms,\n      and I'll show you why.\"",
                "Dick paused amazed at the threshold, for on Torpenhow's sofa lay a girl\n      asleep and breathing heavily. The little cheap sailor-hat, the\n      blue-and-white dress, fitter for June than for February, dabbled with mud\n      at the skirts, the jacket trimmed with imitation Astrakhan and ripped at\n      the shoulder-seams, the one-and-elevenpenny umbrella, and, above all, the\n      disgraceful condition of the kid-topped boots, declared all things.",
                "\"Oh, I say, old man, this is too bad! You mustn't bring this sort up here.\n      They steal things from the rooms.\"",
                "\"It looks bad, I admit, but I was coming in after lunch, and she staggered\n      into the hall. I thought she was drunk at first, but it was collapse. I\n      couldn't leave her as she was, so I brought her up here and gave her your\n      lunch. She was fainting from want of food. She went fast asleep the minute\n      she had finished.\"",
                "\"I know something of that complaint. She's been living on sausages, I\n      suppose. Torp, you should have handed her over to a policeman for\n      presuming to faint in a respectable house. Poor little wretch! Look at the\n      face! There isn't an ounce of immorality in it. Only folly, -- slack,\n      fatuous, feeble, futile folly. It's a typical head. D'you notice how the\n      skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and\n      cheek-bone?\"",
                "\"What a cold-blooded barbarian it is! Don't hit a woman when she's down.\n      Can't we do anything? She was simply dropping with starvation. She almost\n      fell into my arms, and when she got to the food she ate like a wild beast.\n      It was horrible.\"",
                "\"I can give her money, which she would probably spend in drinks. Is she\n      going to sleep for ever?\"",
                "The girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and\n      effrontery.",
                "\"Feeling better?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Yes. Thank you. There aren't many gentlemen that are as kind as you are.\n      Thank you.\"",
                "\"When did you leave service?\" said Dick, who had been watching the scarred\n      and chapped hands.",
                "\"How did you know I was in service? I was. General servant. I didn't like\n      it.\"",
                "\"And how do you like being your own mistress?\"",
                "\"Do I look as if I liked it?\"",
                "\"I suppose not. One moment. Would you be good enough to turn your face to\n      the window?\"",
                "The girl obeyed, and Dick watched her face keenly, -- so keenly that\n      she made as if to hide behind Torpenhow.",
                "\"The eyes have it,\" said Dick, walking up and down. \"They are superb eyes\n      for my business. And, after all, every head depends on the eyes. This has\n      been sent from heaven to make up for -- what was taken away. Now the\n      weekly strain's off my shoulders, I can get to work in earnest. Evidently\n      sent from heaven. Yes. Raise your chin a little, please.\"",
                "\"Gently, old man, gently. You're scaring somebody out of her wits,\" said\n      Torpenhow, who could see the girl trembling.",
                "\"Don't let him hit me! Oh, please don't let him hit me! I've been hit\n      cruel today because I spoke to a man. Don't let him look at me like that!\n      He's reg'lar wicked, that one. Don't let him look at me like that,\n      neither! Oh, I feel as if I hadn't nothing on when he looks at me like\n      that!\"",
                "The overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way, and the girl wept like\n      a little child and began to scream. Dick threw open the window, and\n      Torpenhow flung the door back.",
                "\"There you are,\" said Dick, soothingly. \"My friend here can call for a\n      policeman, and you can run through that door. Nobody is going to hurt\n      you.\"",
                "The girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes, and then tried to laugh.",
                "\"Nothing in the world to hurt you. Now listen to me for a minute. I'm what\n      they call an artist by profession. You know what artists do?\"",
                "\"They draw the things in red and black ink on the pop-shop labels.\"",
                "\"I dare say. I haven't risen to pop-shop labels yet. Those are done by the\n      Academicians. I want to draw your head.\"",
                "\"What for?\"",
                "\"Because it's pretty. That is why you will come to the room across the\n      landing three times a week at eleven in the morning, and I'll give you\n      three quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn. And there's a\n      quid on account.\"",
                "\"For nothing? Oh, my!\" The girl turned the sovereign in her hand, and with\n      more foolish tears, \"Ain't neither 'o you two gentlemen afraid of my\n      bilking you?\"",
                "\"No. Only ugly girls do that. Try and remember this place. And, by the\n      way, what's your name?\"",
                "\"I'm Bessie, -- Bessie --  -- It's no use giving the rest. Bessie\n      Broke, -- Stone-broke, if you like. What's your names? But there, -- no\n      one ever gives the real ones.\"",
                "Dick consulted Torpenhow with his eyes.",
                "\"My name's Heldar, and my friend's called Torpenhow; and you must be sure\n      to come here. Where do you live?\"",
                "\"South-the-water, -- one room, -- five and sixpence a week. Aren't\n      you making fun of me about that three quid?\"",
                "\"You'll see later on. And, Bessie, next time you come, remember, you\n      needn't wear that paint. It's bad for the skin, and I have all the colours\n      you'll be likely to need.\"",
                "Bessie withdrew, scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pocket-handkerchief.\n      The two men looked at each other.",
                "\"You're a man,\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"I'm afraid I've been a fool. It isn't our business to run about the earth\n      reforming Bessie Brokes. And a woman of any kind has no right on this\n      landing.\"",
                "\"Perhaps she won't come back.\"",
                "\"She will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here. I know she will,\n      worse luck. But remember, old man, she isn't a woman; she's my model; and\n      be careful.\"",
                "\"The idea! She's a dissolute little scarecrow, -- a gutter-snippet and\n      nothing more.\"",
                "\"So you think. Wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear.\n      That fair type recovers itself very quickly. You won't know her in a week\n      or two, when that abject fear has died out of her eyes. She'll be too\n      happy and smiling for my purposes.\"",
                "\"But surely you're not taking her out of charity? -- to please me?\"",
                "\"I am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody. She\n      has been sent from heaven, as I may have remarked before, to help me with\n      my Melancolia.\"",
                "\"Never heard a word about the lady before.\"",
                "\"What's the use of having a friend, if you must sling your notions at him\n      in words? You ought to know what I'm thinking about. You've heard me grunt\n      lately?\"",
                "\"Even so; but grunts mean anything in your language, from bad 'baccy to\n      wicked dealers. And I don't think I've been much in your confidence for\n      some time.\"",
                "\"It was a high and soulful grunt. You ought to have understood that it\n      meant the Melancolia.\" Dick walked Torpenhow up and down the room, keeping\n      silence. Then he smote him in the ribs, \"Now don't you see it? Bessie's\n      abject futility, and the terror in her eyes, welded on to one or two\n      details in the way of sorrow that have come under my experience lately.\n      Likewise some orange and black, -- two keys of each. But I can't\n      explain on an empty stomach.\"",
                "\"It sounds mad enough. You'd better stick to your soldiers, Dick, instead\n      of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences.\"",
                "\"Think so?\" Dick began to dance on his heels, singing --",
                "\"They're as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash, You ought to\n      'ear the way they laugh an' joke; They are tricky an' they're funny when\n      they've got the ready money, -- Ow! but see 'em when they're all\n      stone-broke.\"",
                "Then he sat down to pour out his heart to Maisie in a four-sheet letter of\n      counsel and encouragement, and registered an oath that he would get to\n      work with an undivided heart as soon as Bessie should reappear.",
                "The girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned, afraid and overbold\n      by turns. When she found that she was merely expected to sit still, she\n      grew calmer, and criticised the appointments of the studio with freedom\n      and some point. She liked the warmth and the comfort and the release from\n      fear of physical pain. Dick made two or three studies of her head in\n      monochrome, but the actual notion of the Melancolia would not arrive.",
                "\"What a mess you keep your things in!\" said Bessie, some days later, when\n      she felt herself thoroughly at home. \"I s'pose your clothes are just as\n      bad. Gentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for.\"",
                "\"I buy things to wear, and wear 'em till they go to pieces. I don't know\n      what Torpenhow does.\"",
                "Bessie made diligent inquiry in the latter's room, and unearthed a bale of\n      disreputable socks. \"Some of these I'll mend now,\" she said, \"and some\n      I'll take home. D'you know, I sit all day long at home doing nothing, just\n      like a lady, and no more noticing them other girls in the house than if\n      they was so many flies. I don't have any unnecessary words, but I put 'em\n      down quick, I can tell you, when they talk to me. No; it's quite nice\n      these days. I lock my door, and they can only call me names through the\n      keyhole, and I sit inside, just like a lady, mending socks. Mr. Torpenhow\n      wears his socks out both ends at once.\"",
                "\"Three quid a week from me, and the delights of my society. No socks\n      mended. Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again, and\n      all his socks mended. Bessie is very much a woman,\" thought Dick; and he\n      looked at her between half-shut eyes. Food and rest had transformed the\n      girl, as Dick knew they would.",
                "\"What are you looking at me like that for?\" she said quickly. \"Don't. You\n      look reg'lar bad when you look that way. You don't think much o' me, do\n      you?\"",
                "\"That depends on how you behave.\"",
                "Bessie behaved beautifully. Only it was difficult at the end of a sitting\n      to bid her go out into the gray streets. She very much preferred the\n      studio and a big chair by the stove, with some socks in her lap as an\n      excuse for delay. Then Torpenhow would come in, and Bessie would be moved\n      to tell strange and wonderful stories of her past, and still stranger ones\n      of her present improved circumstances. She would make them tea as though\n      she had a right to make it; and once or twice on these occasions Dick\n      caught Torpenhow's eyes fixed on the trim little figure, and because\n      Bessie's flittings about the room made Dick ardently long for Maisie, he\n      realised whither Torpenhow's thoughts were tending. And Bessie was\n      exceedingly careful of the condition of Torpenhow's linen. She spoke very\n      little to him, but sometimes they talked together on the landing.",
                "\"I was a great fool,\" Dick said to himself. \"I know what red firelight\n      looks like when a man's tramping through a strange town; and ours is a\n      lonely, selfish sort of life at the best. I wonder Maisie doesn't feel\n      that sometimes. But I can't order Bessie away. That's the worst of\n      beginning things. One never knows where they stop.\"",
                "One evening, after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light,\n      Dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhow's room. He\n      jumped to his feet. \"Now what ought I to do? It looks foolish to go in. -- Oh,\n      bless you, Binkie!\" The little terrier thrust Torpenhow's door open with\n      his nose and came out to take possession of Dick's chair. The door swung\n      wide unheeded, and Dick across the landing could see Bessie in the\n      half-light making her little supplication to Torpenhow. She was kneeling\n      by his side, and her hands were clasped across his knee.",
                "\"I know, -- I know,\" she said thickly. \"'Tisn't right 'o me to do this,\n      but I can't help it; and you were so kind, -- so kind; and you never\n      took any notice 'o me. And I've mended all your things so carefully, -- I\n      did. Oh, please, 'tisn't as if I was asking you to marry me. I wouldn't\n      think of it. But you -- couldn't you take and live with me till Miss\n      Right comes along? I'm only Miss Wrong, I know, but I'd work my hands to\n      the bare bone for you. And I'm not ugly to look at. Say you will!\"",
                "Dick hardly recognised Torpenhow's voice in reply -- \"But look here.\n      It's no use. I'm liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minute's notice if\n      a war breaks out. At a minute's notice -- dear.\"",
                "\"What does that matter? Until you go, then. Until you go. 'Tisn't much I'm\n      asking, and -- you don't know how good I can cook.\" She had put an arm\n      round his neck and was drawing his head down.",
                "\"Until -- I -- go, then.\"",
                "\"Torp,\" said Dick, across the landing. He could hardly steady his voice.",

                "\"Heaven send he'll listen to me!\" There was something very like an oath\n      from Bessie's lips. She was afraid of Dick, and disappeared down the\n      staircase in panic, but it seemed an age before Torpenhow entered the\n      studio. He went to the mantelpiece, buried his head on his arms, and\n      groaned like a wounded bull.",
                "\"What the devil right have you to interfere?\" he said, at last.",
                "\"Who's interfering with which? Your own sense told you long ago you\n      couldn't be such a fool. It was a tough rack, St. Anthony, but you're all\n      right now.\"",

                "CHAPTER X",
                "What's you that follows at my side? -- \n     The foe that ye must fight, my lord. -- \n     That hirples swift as I can ride? -- \n     The shadow of the night, my lord. -- \n     Then wheel my horse against the foe! -- \n     He's down and overpast, my lord.\n\n     Ye war against the sunset glow;\n     The darkness gathers fast, my lord.\n              --  -- The Fight of Heriot's Ford",
                "\"This is a cheerful life,\" said Dick, some days later. \"Torp's away;\n      Bessie hates me; I can't get at the notion of the Melancolia; Maisie's\n      letters are scrappy; and I believe I have indigestion. What give a man\n      pains across the head and spots before his eyes, Binkie? Shall us take\n      some liver pills?\"",
                "Dick had just gone through a lively scene with Bessie. She had for the\n      fiftieth time reproached him for sending Torpenhow away. She explained her\n      enduring hatred for Dick, and made it clear to him that she only sat for\n      the sake of his money. \"And Mr. Torpenhow's ten times a better man than\n      you,\" she concluded.",
                "\"He is. That's why he went away. I should have stayed and made love to\n      you.\"",
                "The girl sat with her chin on her hand, scowling. \"To me! I'd like to\n      catch you! If I wasn't afraid 'o being hung I'd kill you. That's what I'd\n      do. D'you believe me?\"",
                "Dick smiled wearily. It is not pleasant to live in the company of a notion\n      that will not work out, a fox-terrier that cannot talk, and a woman who\n      talks too much. He would have answered, but at that moment there unrolled\n      itself from one corner of the studio a veil, as it were, of the flimsiest\n      gauze. He rubbed his eyes, but the gray haze would not go.",
                "\"This is disgraceful indigestion. Binkie, we will go to a medicine-man. We\n      can't have our eyes interfered with, for by these we get our bread; also\n      mutton-chop bones for little dogs.\"",
                "The doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair, and he said\n      nothing till Dick began to describe the gray film in the studio.",
                "\"We all want a little patching and repairing from time to time,\" he\n      chirped. \"Like a ship, my dear sir, -- exactly like a ship. Sometimes\n      the hull is out of order, and we consult the surgeon; sometimes the\n      rigging, and then I advise; sometimes the engines, and we go to the\n      brain-specialist; sometimes the look-out on the bridge is tired, and then\n      we see an oculist. I should recommend you to see an oculist. A little\n      patching and repairing from time to time is all we want. An oculist, by\n      all means.\"",
                "Dick sought an oculist, -- the best in London. He was certain that the\n      local practitioner did not know anything about his trade, and more certain\n      that Maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear spectacles.",
                "\"I've neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long. Hence these\n      spots before the eyes, Binkie. I can see as well as I ever could.\"",
                "As he entered the dark hall that led to the consulting-room a man cannoned\n      against him. Dick saw the face as it hurried out into the street.",
                "\"That's the writer-type. He has the same modelling of the forehead as\n      Torp. He looks very sick. Probably heard something he didn't like.\"",
                "Even as he thought, a great fear came upon Dick, a fear that made him hold\n      his breath as he walked into the oculist's waiting room, with the heavy\n      carved furniture, the dark-green paper, and the sober-hued prints on the\n      wall. He recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches.",
                "Many people were waiting their turn before him. His eye was caught by a\n      flaming red-and-gold Christmas-carol book. Little children came to that\n      eye-doctor, and they needed large-type amusement.",
                "\"That's idolatrous bad Art,\" he said, drawing the book towards himself.",
                "\"From the anatomy of the angels, it has been made in Germany.\" He opened\n      in mechanically, and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red ink --",
                "The next good joy that Mary had,\n It was the joy of three,\n To see her good Son Jesus Christ\n Making the blind to see;\n Making the blind to see, good Lord,\n And happy we may be.\n Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost\n To all eternity!",
                "Dick read and re-read the verse till his turn came, and the doctor was\n      bending above him seated in an arm-chair. The blaze of the gas-microscope\n      in his eyes made him wince. The doctor's hand touched the scar of the\n      sword-cut on Dick's head, and Dick explained briefly how he had come by\n      it. When the flame was removed, Dick saw the doctor's face, and the fear\n      came upon him again. The doctor wrapped himself in a mist of words. Dick\n      caught allusions to \"scar,\" \"frontal bone,\" \"optic nerve,\" \"extreme\n      caution,\" and the \"avoidance of mental anxiety.\"",
                "\"Verdict?\" he said faintly. \"My business is painting, and I daren't waste\n      time. What do you make of it?\"",
                "Again the whirl of words, but this time they conveyed a meaning.",
                "\"Can you give me anything to drink?\"",
                "Many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room, and the prisoners\n      often needed cheering. Dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand.",
                "\"As far as I can gather,\" he said, coughing above the spirit, \"you call it\n      decay of the optic nerve, or something, and therefore hopeless. What is my\n      time-limit, avoiding all strain and worry?\"",
                "\"Perhaps one year.\"",
                "\"My God! And if I don't take care of myself?\"",
                "\"I really could not say. One cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury\n      inflicted by the sword-cut. The scar is an old one, and -- exposure to\n      the strong light of the desert, did you say? -- with excessive\n      application to fine work? I really could not say?\"",
                "\"I beg your pardon, but it has come without any warning. If you will let\n      me, I'll sit here for a minute, and then I'll go. You have been very good\n      in telling me the truth. Without any warning; without any warning.\n      Thanks.\"",
                "Dick went into the street, and was rapturously received by Binkie.",
                "\"We've got it very badly, little dog! Just as badly as we can get it.\n      We'll go to the Park to think it out.\"",
                "They headed for a certain tree that Dick knew well, and they sat down to\n      think, because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear\n      at the pit of his stomach.",
                "\"How could it have come without any warning? It's as sudden as being shot.\n      It's the living death, Binkie. We're to be shut up in the dark in one year\n      if we're careful, and we shan't see anybody, and we shall never have\n      anything we want, not though we live to be a hundred!\" Binkie wagged his\n      tail joyously. \"Binkie, we must think. Let's see how it feels to be\n      blind.\" Dick shut his eyes, and flaming commas and Catherine-wheels\n      floated inside the lids. Yet when he looked across the Park the scope of\n      his vision was not contracted. He could see perfectly, until a procession\n      of slow-wheeling fireworks defiled across his eyeballs.",
                "\"Little dorglums, we aren't at all well. Let's go home. If only Torp were\n      back, now!\"",
                "But Torpenhow was in the south of England, inspecting dockyards in the\n      company of the Nilghai. His letters were brief and full of mystery.",
                "Dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows. He\n      argued, in the loneliness of his studio, henceforward to be decorated with\n      a film of gray gauze in one corner, that, if his fate were blindness, all\n      the Torpenhows in the world could not save him. \"I can't call him off his\n      trip to sit down and sympathise with me. I must pull through this business\n      alone,\" he said. He was lying on the sofa, eating his moustache and\n      wondering what the darkness of the night would be like. Then came to his\n      mind the memory of a quaint scene in the Soudan. A soldier had been nearly\n      hacked in two by a broad-bladed Arab spear. For one instant the man felt\n      no pain. Looking down, he saw that his life-blood was going from him. The\n      stupid bewilderment on his face was so intensely comic that both Dick and\n      Torpenhow, still panting and unstrung from a fight for life, had roared\n      with laughter, in which the man seemed as if he would join, but, as his\n      lips parted in a sheepish grin, the agony of death came upon him, and he\n      pitched grunting at their feet. Dick laughed again, remembering the\n      horror. It seemed so exactly like his own case.",
                "\"But I have a little more time allowed me,\" he said. He paced up and down\n      the room, quietly at first, but afterwards with the hurried feet of fear.\n      It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go\n      forward; and there were only weaving circles and floating pin-dots before\n      his eyes.",
                "\"We need to be calm, Binkie; we must be calm.\" He talked aloud for the\n      sake of distraction. \"This isn't nice at all. What shall we do? We must do\n      something. Our time is short. I shouldn't have believed that this morning;\n      but now things are different. Binkie, where was Moses when the light went\n      out?\"",
                "Binkie smiled from ear to ear, as a well-bred terrier should, but made no\n      suggestion.",
                "\"'Were there but world enough and time, This coyness, Binkie, were not\n      crime.... But at my back I always hear --  -- '\" He wiped his\n      forehead, which was unpleasantly damp. \"What can I do? What can I do? I\n      haven't any notions left, and I can't think connectedly, but I must do\n      something, or I shall go off my head.\"",
                "The hurried walk recommenced, Dick stopping every now and again to drag\n      forth long-neglected canvases and old note-books; for he turned to his\n      work by instinct, as a thing that could not fail. \"You won't do, and you\n      won't do,\" he said, at each inspection. \"No more soldiers. I couldn't\n      paint 'em. Sudden death comes home too nearly, and this is battle and\n      murder for me.\"",
                "The day was failing, and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight of\n      the blind had come upon him unaware. \"Allah Almighty!\" he cried\n      despairingly, \"help me through the time of waiting, and I won't whine when\n      my punishment comes. What can I do now, before the light goes?\"",
                "There was no answer. Dick waited till he could regain some sort of control\n      over himself. His hands were shaking, and he prided himself on their\n      steadiness; he could feel that his lips were quivering, and the sweat was\n      running down his face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward by the desire\n      to get to work at once and accomplish something, and maddened by the\n      refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news that he was about to\n      go blind. \"It's a humiliating exhibition,\" he thought, \"and I'm glad Torp\n      isn't here to see. The doctor said I was to avoid mental worry. Come here\n      and let me pet you, Binkie.\"",
                "The little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him.",
                "Then he heard the man speaking in the twilight, and, doglike, understood\n      that his trouble stood off from him -- \"Allah is good, Binkie. Not\n      quite so gentle as we could wish, but we'll discuss that later. I think I\n      see my way to it now. All those studies of Bessie's head were nonsense,\n      and they nearly brought your master into a scrape. I hold the notion now\n      as clear as crystal, 'the Melancolia that transcends all wit.' There shall\n      be Maisie in that head, because I shall never get Maisie; and Bess, of\n      course, because she knows all about Melancolia, though she doesn't know\n      she knows; and there shall be some drawing in it, and it shall all end up\n      with a laugh. That's for myself. Shall she giggle or grin? No, she shall\n      laugh right out of the canvas, and every man and woman that ever had a\n      sorrow of their own shall -- what is it the poem says? -- \n      'Understand the speech and feel a stir Of fellowship in all disastrous\n      fight.'",
                "\"'In all disastrous fight'? That's better than painting the thing merely\n      to pique Maisie. I can do it now because I have it inside me. Binkie, I'm\n      going to hold you up by your tail. You're an omen. Come here.\"",
                "Binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking.",
                "\"Rather like holding a guinea-pig; but you're a brave little dog, and you\n      don't yelp when you're hung up. It is an omen.\"",
                "Binkie went to his own chair, and as often as he looked saw Dick walking\n      up and down, rubbing his hands and chuckling. That night Dick wrote a\n      letter to Maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health, but saying\n      very little about his own, and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born. Not\n      till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the\n      future.",
                "He fell to work, whistling softly, and was swallowed up in the clean,\n      clear joy of creation, which does not come to man too often, lest he\n      should consider himself the equal of his God, and so refuse to die at the\n      appointed time. He forgot Maisie, Torpenhow, and Binkie at his feet, but\n      remembered to stir Bessie, who needed very little stirring, into a\n      tremendous rage, that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes.",
                "He threw himself without reservation into his work, and did not think of\n      the doom that was to overtake him, for he was possessed with his notion,\n      and the things of this world had no power upon him.",
                "\"You're pleased today,\" said Bessie.",
                "Dick waved his mahl-stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for\n      a drink. In the evening, when the exaltation of the day had died down, he\n      went to the sideboard again, and after some visits became convinced that\n      the eye-doctor was a liar, since he could still see everything very\n      clearly.",
                "He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie, and that\n      whether she liked it or not she should be his wife. The mood passed next\n      morning, but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort.",
                "Again he set to work, and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and\n      blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard, and the Melancolia\n      both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever. There\n      was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him, such as they feel who\n      walking among their fellow-men know that the death-sentence of disease is\n      upon them, and, seeing that fear is but waste of the little time left, are\n      riotously happy. The days passed without event.",
                "Bessie arrived punctually always, and, though her voice seemed to Dick to\n      come from a distance, her face was always very near. The Melancolia began\n      to flame on the canvas, in the likeness of a woman who had known all the\n      sorrow in the world and was laughing at it. It was true that the corners\n      of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into the\n      darkness, that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head were\n      very troublesome, and that Maisie's letters were hard to read and harder\n      still to answer. He could not tell her of his trouble, and he could not\n      laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which was always going to be\n      finished. But the furious days of toil and the nights of wild dreams made\n      amends for all, and the sideboard was his best friend on earth.",
                "Bessie was singularly dull. She used to shriek with rage when Dick stared\n      at her between half-closed eyes. Now she sulked, or watched him with\n      disgust, saying very little.",
                "Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks. An incoherent note heralded his\n      return. \"News! great news!\" he wrote. \"The Nilghai knows, and so does the\n      Keneu. We're all back on Thursday. Get lunch and clean your\n      accoutrements.\"",
                "Dick showed Bessie the letter, and she abused him for that he had ever\n      sent Torpenhow away and ruined her life.",
                "\"Well,\" said Dick, brutally, \"you're better as you are, instead of making\n      love to some drunken beast in the street.\" He felt that he had rescued\n      Torpenhow from great temptation.",
                "\"I don't know if that's any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a\n      studio. You haven't been sober for three weeks. You've been soaking the\n      whole time; and yet you pretend you're better than me!\"",
                "\"What d'you mean?\" said Dick.",
                "\"Mean! You'll see when Mr. Torpenhow comes back.\"",
                "It was not long to wait. Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a\n      sign of feeling. He had news that was more to him than many Bessies, and\n      the Keneu and the Nilghai were trampling behind him, calling for Dick.",
                "\"Drinking like a fish,\" Bessie whispered. \"He's been at it for nearly a\n      month.\" She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done.",
                "They came into the studio, rejoicing, to be welcomed over effusively by a\n      drawn, lined, shrunken, haggard wreck, -- unshaven, blue-white about\n      the nostrils, stooping in the shoulders, and peering under his eyebrows\n      nervously. The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick.",
                "\"Is this you?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"All that's left of me. Sit down. Binkie's quite well, and I've been doing\n      some good work.\" He reeled where he stood.",
                "\"You've done some of the worst work you've ever done in your life. Man\n      alive, you're --  -- \"",
                "Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly, and they left the room to\n      find lunch elsewhere. Then he spoke; but, since the reproof of a friend is\n      much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed, and since Torpenhow\n      used figures and metaphors which were unseemly, and contempt\n      untranslatable, it will never be known what was actually said to Dick, who\n      blinked and winked and picked at his hands. After a time the culprit began\n      to feel the need of a little self-respect. He was quite sure that he had\n      not in any way departed from virtue, and there were reasons, too, of which\n      Torpenhow knew nothing. He would explain.",
                "He rose, tried to straighten his shoulders, and spoke to the face he could\n      hardly see.",
                "\"You are right,\" he said. \"But I am right, too. After you went away I had\n      some trouble with my eyes. So I went to an oculist, and he turned a\n      gasogene -- I mean a gas-engine -- into my eye. That was very long\n      ago. He said, 'Scar on the head, -- sword-cut and optic nerve.' Make a\n      note of that. So I am going blind. I have some work to do before I go\n      blind, and I suppose that I must do it. I cannot see much now, but I can\n      see best when I am drunk. I did not know I was drunk till I was told, but\n      I must go on with my work. If you want to see it, there it is.\" He pointed\n      to the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause.",
                "Torpenhow said nothing, and Dick began to whimper feebly, for joy at\n      seeing Torpenhow again, for grief at misdeeds -- if indeed they were\n      misdeeds -- that made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic, and for\n      childish vanity hurt, since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to\n      his wonderful picture.",
                "Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause, and saw the two\n      walking up and down as usual, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's shoulder.",
                "Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie, who was\n      dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master\n      again."

                "\"Go on, then. I give you three days; but you're nearly breaking my heart.\"",
                "Dick returned to his work, toiling as one possessed; and the yellow devil\n      of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes. The\n      Melancolia was nearly finished, and was all or nearly all that he had\n      hoped she would be. Dick jested with Bessie, who reminded him that he was\n      \"a drunken beast\"; but the reproof did not move him.",
                "\"You can't understand, Bess. We are in sight of land now, and soon we\n      shall lie back and think about what we've done. I'll give you three\n      months' pay when the picture's finished, and next time I have any more\n      work in hand -- but that doesn't matter. Won't three months' pay make\n      you hate me less?\"",
                "\"No, it won't! I hate you, and I'll go on hating you. Mr. Torpenhow won't\n      speak to me any more. He's always looking at maps.\"",
                "Bessie did not say that she had again laid siege to Torpenhow, or that at\n      the end of our passionate pleading he had picked her up, given her a kiss,\n      and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a little\n      fool. He spent most of his time in the company of the Nilghai, and their\n      talk was of war in the near future, the hiring of transports, and secret\n      preparations among the dockyards. He did not wish to see Dick till the\n      picture was finished.",
                "\"He's doing first-class work,\" he said to the Nilghai, \"and it's quite out\n      of his regular line. But, for the matter of that, so's his infernal\n      soaking.\"",
                "\"Never mind. Leave him alone. When he has come to his senses again we'll\n      carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air. Poor Dick! I\n      don't envy you, Torp, when his eyes fail.\"",
                "\"Yes, it will be a case of 'God help the man who's chained to our Davie.'\n      The worst is that we don't know when it will happen, and I believe the\n      uncertainty and the waiting have sent Dick to the whiskey more than\n      anything else.\"",
                "\"How the Arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew!\"",
                "\"He's at perfect liberty to grin if he can. He's dead. That's poor\n      consolation now.\"",
                "In the afternoon of the third day Torpenhow heard Dick calling for him.",
                "\"All finished!\" he shouted. \"I've done it! Come in! Isn't she a beauty?\n      Isn't she a darling? I've been down to hell to get her; but isn't she\n      worth it?\"",
                "Torpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laughed, -- a full-lipped,\n      hollow-eyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as Dick had intended\n      she would.",
                "\"Who taught you how to do it?\" said Torpenhow. \"The touch and notion have\n      nothing to do with your regular work. What a face it is! What eyes, and\n      what insolence!\" Unconsciously he threw back his head and laughed with\n      her. \"She's seen the game played out, -- I don't think she had a good\n      time of it, -- and now she doesn't care. Isn't that the idea?\"",
                "\"Exactly.\"",
                "\"Where did you get the mouth and chin from? They don't belong to Bess.\"",
                "\"They're -- some one else's. But isn't it good? Isn't it thundering\n      good? Wasn't it worth the whiskey? I did it. Alone I did it, and it's the\n      best I can do.\" He drew his breath sharply, and whispered, \"Just God! what\n      could I not do ten years hence, if I can do this now! -- By the way,\n      what do you think of it, Bess?\"",
                "The girl was biting her lips. She loathed Torpenhow because he had taken\n      no notice of her.",
                "\"I think it's just the horridest, beastliest thing I ever saw,\" she\n      answered, and turned away.",
                "\"More than you will be of that way of thinking, young woman. -- Dick,\n      there's a sort of murderous, viperine suggestion in the poise of the head\n      that I don't understand,\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"That's trick-work,\" said Dick, chuckling with delight at being completely\n      understood. \"I couldn't resist one little bit of sheer swagger. It's a\n      French trick, and you wouldn't understand; but it's got at by slewing\n      round the head a trifle, and a tiny, tiny foreshortening of one side of\n      the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the left ear. That, and\n      deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear. It was flagrant\n      trick-work; but, having the notion fixed, I felt entitled to play with it, -- Oh,\n      you beauty!\"",
                "\"Amen! She is a beauty. I can feel it.\"",
                "\"So will every man who has any sorrow of his own,\" said Dick, slapping his\n      thigh. \"He shall see his trouble there, and, by the Lord Harry, just when\n      he's feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his head and\n      laugh, -- as she is laughing. I've put the life of my heart and the\n      light of my eyes into her, and I don't care what comes.... I'm tired, -- awfully\n      tired. I think I'll get to sleep. Take away the whiskey, it has served its\n      turn, and give Bessie thirty-six quid, and three over for luck. Cover the\n      picture.\"",
                "He dropped asleep in the long chair, hid face white and haggard, almost\n      before he had finished the sentence. Bessie tried to take Torpenhow's\n      hand. \"Aren't you never going to speak to me any more?\" she said; but\n      Torpenhow was looking at Dick.",
                "\"What a stock of vanity the man has! I'll take him in hand tomorrow and\n      make much of him. He deserves it. -- Eh! what was that, Bess?\"",
                "\"Nothing. I'll put things tidy here a little, and then I'll go. You\n      couldn't give Me that three months' pay now, could you? He said you were\n      to.\"",
                "Torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms. Bessie faithfully\n      tidied up the studio, set the door ajar for flight, emptied half a bottle\n      of turpentine on a duster, and began to scrub the face of the Melancolia\n      viciously. The paint did not smudge quickly enough. She took a\n      palette-knife and scraped, following each stroke with the wet duster. In\n      five minutes the picture was a formless, scarred muddle of colours. She\n      threw the paint-stained duster into the studio stove, stuck out her tongue\n      at the sleeper, and whispered, \"Bilked!\" as she turned to run down the\n      staircase. She would never see Torpenhow any more, but she had at least\n      done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire and who used\n      to make fun of her. Cashing the check was the very cream of the jest to\n      Bessie. Then the little privateer sailed across the Thames, to be\n      swallowed up in the gray wilderness of South-the-Water.",
                "Dick slept till late in the evening, when Torpenhow dragged him off to\n      bed. His eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse. \"Let's have another\n      look at the picture,\" he said, insistently as a child.",
                "\"You -- go -- to -- bed,\" said Torpenhow. \"You aren't at all\n      well, though you mayn't know it. You're as jumpy as a cat.\"",
                "\"I reform tomorrow. Good night.\"",
                "As he repassed through the studio, Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the\n      picture, and almost betrayed himself by outcries: \"Wiped out! -- scraped\n      out and turped out! He's on the verge of jumps as it is. That's Bess, -- the\n      little fiend! Only a woman could have done that! -- with the ink not\n      dry on the check, too! Dick will be raving mad tomorrow. It was all my\n      fault for trying to help gutter-devils. Oh, my poor Dick, the Lord is\n      hitting you very hard!\"",
                "Dick could not sleep that night, partly for pure joy, and partly because\n      the well-known Catherine-wheels inside his eyes had given place to\n      crackling volcanoes of many-coloured fire. \"Spout away,\" he said aloud.",
                "\"I've done my work, and now you can do what you please.\" He lay still,\n      staring at the ceiling, the long-pent-up delirium of drink in his veins,\n      his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be\n      considered, and his hands crisped and dry. He had just discovered that he\n      was painting the face of the Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with\n      millions of lights, and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied\n      hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank, shouting together in his\n      honour, when something cracked inside his temples like an overstrained\n      bowstring, the glittering dome broke inward, and he was alone in the thick\n      night.",
                "\"I'll go to sleep. The room's very dark. Let's light a lamp and see how\n      the Melancolia looks. There ought to have been a moon.\"",
                "It was then that Torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did\n      not know, -- in the rattling accents of deadly fear.",
                "\"He's looked at the picture,\" was his first thought, as he hurried into\n      the bedroom and found Dick sitting up and beating the air with his hands.",
                "\"Torp! Torp! where are you? For pity's sake, come to me!\"",
                "\"What's the matter?\"",
                "Dick clutched at his shoulder. \"Matter! I've been lying here for hours in\n      the dark, and you never heard me. Torp, old man, don't go away. I'm all in\n      the dark. In the dark, I tell you!\"",
                "Torpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dick's eyes, but there was no\n      light in those eyes. He lit the gas, and Dick heard the flame catch. The\n      grip of his fingers on Torpenhow's shoulder made Torpenhow wince.",
                "\"Don't leave me. You wouldn't leave me alone now, would you? I can't see.\n      D'you understand? It's black, -- quite black, -- and I feel as if I\n      was falling through it all.\"",
                "\"Steady does it.\" Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock him\n      gently to and fro.",
                "\"That's good. Now don't talk. If I keep very quiet for a while, this\n      darkness will lift. It seems just on the point of breaking. H'sh!\" Dick\n      knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him. The night air was\n      chilling Torpenhow's toes.",
                "\"Can you stay like that a minute?\" he said. \"I'll get my dressing-gown and\n      some slippers.\"",
                "Dick clutched the bed-head with both hands and waited for the darkness to\n      clear away. \"What a time you've been!\" he cried, when Torpenhow returned.\n      \"It's as black as ever. What are you banging about in the door-way?\"",
                "\"Long chair, -- horse-blanket, -- pillow. Going to sleep by you. Lie\n      down now; you'll be better in the morning.\"",
                "\"I shan't!\" The voice rose to a wail. \"My God! I'm blind! I'm blind, and\n      the darkness will never go away.\" He made as if to leap from the bed, but\n      Torpenhow's arms were round him, and Torpenhow's chin was on his shoulder,\n      and his breath was squeezed out of him. He could only gasp, \"Blind!\" and\n      wriggle feebly.",
                "\"Steady, Dickie, steady!\" said the deep voice in his ear, and the grip\n      tightened. \"Bite on the bullet, old man, and don't let them think you're\n      afraid.\" The grip could draw no closer. Both men were breathing heavily.",
                "Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned.",
                "\"Let me go,\" he panted. \"You're cracking my ribs. We -- we mustn't let\n      them think we're afraid, must we, -- all the powers of darkness and\n      that lot?\"",
                "\"Lie down. It's all over now.\"",
                "\"Yes,\" said Dick, obediently. \"But would you mind letting me hold your\n      hand? I feel as if I wanted something to hold on to. One drops through the\n      dark so.\"",
                "Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair. Dick\n      clutched it tightly, and in half an hour had fallen asleep. Torpenhow\n      withdrew his hand, and, stooping over Dick, kissed him lightly on the\n      forehead, as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death,\n      to ease his departure.",
                "In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself. He was adrift on\n      the shoreless tides of delirium, speaking very quickly -- \"It's a pity, -- a\n      great pity; but it's helped, and it must be eaten, Master George.\n      Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof, and, further, putting\n      aside all Melancolias and false humours, it is of obvious notoriety -- such\n      as mine was -- that the queen can do no wrong. Torp doesn't know that.\n      I'll tell him when we're a little farther into the desert.",
                "\"What a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamer-ropes! They'll have\n      that four-inch hawser chafed through in a minute. I told you so -- there\n      she goes! White foam on green water, and the steamer slewing round. How\n      good that looks! I'll sketch it. No, I can't. I'm afflicted with\n      ophthalmia. That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt, and it extends up\n      the Nile in the shape of cataract. Ha! that's a joke, Torp. Laugh, you\n      graven image, and stand clear of the hawser.... It'll knock you into the\n      water and make your dress all dirty, Maisie dear.\"",
                "\"Oh!\" said Torpenhow. \"This happened before. That night on the river.\"",
                "\"She'll be sure to say it's my fault if you get muddy, and you're quite\n      near enough to the breakwater. Maisie, that's not fair. Ah! I knew you'd\n      miss. Low and to the left, dear. But you've no conviction. Don't be angry,\n      darling. I'd cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than\n      obstinacy. My right hand, if it would serve.\"",
                "\"Now we mustn't listen. Here's an island shouting across seas of\n      misunderstanding with a vengeance. But it's shouting truth, I fancy,\" said\n      Torpenhow.",
                "The babble continued. It all bore upon Maisie. Sometimes Dick lectured at\n      length on his craft, then he cursed himself for his folly in being\n      enslaved. He pleaded to Maisie for a kiss -- only one kiss -- before\n      she went away, and called to her to come back from Vitry-sur-Marne, if she\n      would; but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that\n      the queen could do no wrong.",
                "Torpenhow listened attentively, and learned every detail of Dick's life\n      that had been hidden from him. For three days Dick raved through the past,\n      and then a natural sleep. \"What a strain he has been running under, poor\n      chap!\" said Torpenhow. \"Dick, of all men, handing himself over like a dog!\n      And I was lecturing him on arrogance! I ought to have known that it was no\n      use to judge a man. But I did it. What a demon that girl must be! Dick's\n      given her his life, -- confound him! -- and she's given him one kiss\n      apparently.\"",
                "\"Torp,\" said Dick, from the bed, \"go out for a walk. You've been here too\n      long. I'll get up. Hi! This is annoying. I can't dress myself. Oh, it's\n      too absurd!\"",
                "Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the\n      studio. He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to\n      lift. It did not lift that day, nor the next. Dick adventured on a voyage\n      round the walls. He hit his shins against the stove, and this suggested to\n      him that it would be better to crawl on all fours, one hand in front of\n      him. Torpenhow found him on the floor.",
                "\"I'm trying to get the geography of my new possessions,\" said he. \"D'you\n      remember that nigger you gouged in the square? Pity you didn't keep the\n      odd eye. It would have been useful. Any letters for me? Give me all the\n      ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside. They're of\n      no importance.\"",
                "Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M. on the envelope flap. Dick put\n      it into his pocket. There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might not have\n      read, but it belonged to himself and to Maisie, who would never belong to\n      him.",
                "\"When she finds that I don't write, she'll stop writing. It's better so. I\n      couldn't be any use to her now,\" Dick argued, and the tempter suggested\n      that he should make known his condition. Every nerve in him revolted. \"I\n      have fallen low enough already. I'm not going to beg for pity. Besides, it\n      would be cruel to her.\" He strove to put Maisie out of his thoughts; but\n      the blind have many opportunities for thinking, and as the tides of his\n      strength came back to him in the long employless days of dead darkness,\n      Dick's soul was troubled to the core. Another letter, and another, came\n      from Maisie. Then there was silence, and Dick sat by the window, the pulse\n      of summer in the air, and pictured her being won by another man, stronger\n      than himself. His imagination, the keener for the dark background it\n      worked against, spared him no single detail that might send him raging up\n      and down the studio, to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four\n      places at once. Worst of all, tobacco would not taste in the darkness. The\n      arrogance of the man had disappeared, and in its place were settled\n      despair that Torpenhow knew, and blind passion that Dick confided to his\n      pillow at night. The intervals between the paroxysms were filled with\n      intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness.",
                "\"Come out into the Park,\" said Torpenhow. \"You haven't stirred out since\n      the beginning of things.\"",
                "\"What's the use? There's no movement in the dark; and, besides,\" -- he\n      paused irresolutely at the head of the stairs, -- \"something will run\n      over me.\"",
                "\"Not if I'm with you. Proceed gingerly.\"",
                "The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror, and he clung to\n      Torpenhow's arm. \"Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot!\" he\n      said petulantly, as he turned into the Park. \"Let's curse God and die.\"",
                "\"Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments. By Jove, there\n      are the Guards!\"",
                "Dick's figure straightened. \"Let's get near 'em. Let's go in and look.\n      Let's get on the grass and run. I can smell the trees.\"",
                "\"Mind the low railing. That's all right!\" Torpenhow kicked out a tuft of\n      grass with his heel. \"Smell that,\" he said. \"Isn't it good?\" Dick sniffed\n      luxuriously. \"Now pick up your feet and run.\" They approached as near to\n      the regiment as was possible. The clank of bayonets being unfixed made\n      Dick's nostrils quiver.",
                "\"Let's get nearer. They're in column, aren't they?\"",
                "\"Yes. How did you know?\"",
                "\"Felt it. Oh, my men! -- my beautiful men!\" He edged forward as though\n      he could see. \"I could draw those chaps once. Who'll draw 'em now?\"",
                "\"They'll move off in a minute. Don't jump when the band begins.\"",
                "\"Huh! I'm not a new charger. It's the silences that hurt. Nearer, Torp! -- nearer!\n      Oh, my God, what wouldn't I give to see 'em for a minute! -- one\n      half-minute!\"",
                "He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him, could hear the\n      slings tighten across the bandsman's chest as he heaved the big drum from\n      the ground.",
                "\"Sticks crossed above his head,\" whispered Torpenhow.",
                "\"I know. I know! Who should know if I don't? H'sh!\"",
                "The drum-sticks fell with a boom, and the men swung forward to the crash\n      of the band. Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face, heard\n      the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts.\n      The big drum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall refrain that made a\n      perfect quickstep --",
                "\"He must be a man of decent height,\n   He must be a man of weight,\n   He must come home on a Saturday night\n   In a thoroughly sober state;\n   He must know how to love me,\n   And he must know how to kiss;\n   And if he's enough to keep us both\n   I can't refuse him bliss.\"",
                "\"What's the matter?\" said Torpenhow, as he saw Dick's head fall when the\n      last of the regiment had departed.",
                "\"Nothing. I feel a little bit out of the running, -- that's all. Torp,\n      take me back. Why did you bring me out?\""

                "The Nilghai was angry with Torpenhow. Dick had been sent to bed, -- blind\n      men are ever under the orders of those who can see, -- and since he had\n      returned from the Park had fluently sworn at Torpenhow because he was\n      alive, and all the world because it was alive and could see, while he,\n      Dick, was dead in the death of the blind, who, at the best, are only\n      burdens upon their associates. Torpenhow had said something about a Mrs.\n      Gummidge, and Dick had retired in a black fury to handle and re-handle\n      three unopened letters from Maisie.",
                "The Nilghai, fat, burly, and aggressive, was in Torpenhow's rooms.",
                "Behind him sat the Keneu, the Great War Eagle, and between them lay a\n      large map embellished with black-and-white-headed pins.",
                "\"I was wrong about the Balkans,\" said the Nilghai. \"But I'm not wrong\n      about this business. The whole of our work in the Southern Soudan must be\n      done over again. The public doesn't care, of course, but the government\n      does, and they are making their arrangements quietly. You know that as\n      well as I do.\"",
                "\"I remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from\n      Omdurman. It was bound to crop up sooner or later. But I can't go,\" said\n      Torpenhow. He pointed through the open door; it was a hot night. \"Can you\n      blame me?\"",
                "The Keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy cat -- \"Don't\n      blame you in the least. It's uncommonly good of you, and all the rest of\n      it, but every man -- even you, Torp -- must consider his work. I\n      know it sounds brutal, but Dick's out of the race, -- down, -- gastados\n      expended, finished, done for. He has a little money of his own. He won't\n      starve, and you can't pull out of your slide for his sake. Think of your\n      own reputation.\"",
                "\"Dick's was five times bigger than mine and yours put together.\"",
                "\"That was because he signed his name to everything he did. It's all ended\n      now. You must hold yourself in readiness to move out. You can command your\n      own prices, and you do better work than any three of us.\"",
                "\"Don't tell me how tempting it is. I'll stay here to look after Dick for a\n      while. He's as cheerful as a bear with a sore head, but I think he likes\n      to have me near him.\"",
                "The Nilghai said something uncomplimentary about soft-headed fools who\n      throw away their careers for other fools. Torpenhow flushed angrily. The\n      constant strain of attendance on Dick had worn his nerves thin.",
                "\"There remains a third fate,\" said the Keneu, thoughtfully. \"Consider\n      this, and be not larger fools than necessary. Dick is -- or rather was -- an\n      able-bodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of audacity.\"",
                "\"Oho!\" said the Nilghai, who remembered an affair at Cairo. \"I begin to\n      see, -- Torp, I'm sorry.\"",
                "Torpenhow nodded forgiveness: \"You were more sorry when he cut you out,\n      though. -- Go on, Keneu.\"",
                "\"I've often thought, when I've seen men die out in the desert, that if the\n      news could be sent through the world, and the means of transport were\n      quick enough, there would be one woman at least at each man's bedside.\"",
                "\"There would be some mighty quaint revelations. Let us be grateful things\n      are as they are,\" said the Nilghai.",
                "\"Let us rather reverently consider whether Torp's three-cornered\n      ministrations are exactly what Dick needs just now. -- What do you\n      think yourself, Torp?\"",
                "\"I know they aren't. But what can I do?\"",
                "\"Lay the matter before the board. We are all Dick's friends here. You've\n      been most in his life.\"",
                "\"But I picked it up when he was off his head.\"",
                "\"The greater chance of its being true. I thought we should arrive. Who is\n      she?\"",
                "Then Torpenhow told a tale in plain words, as a special correspondent who\n      knows how to make a verbal precis should tell it. The men listened without\n      interruption.",
                "\"Is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his\n      calf-love?\"",
                "said the Keneu. \"Is it possible?\"",
                "\"I give the facts. He says nothing about it now, but he sits fumbling\n      three letters from her when he thinks I'm not looking. What am I to do?\"",
                "\"Speak to him,\" said the Nilghai.",
                "\"Oh yes! Write to her, -- I don't know her full name, remember, -- and\n      ask her to accept him out of pity. I believe you once told Dick you were\n      sorry for him, Nilghai. You remember what happened, eh? Go into the\n      bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl,\n      whoever she is. I honestly believe he'd try to kill you; and the blindness\n      has made him rather muscular.\"",
                "\"Torpenhow's course is perfectly clear,\" said the Keneu. \"He will go to\n      Vitry-sur-Marne, which is on the Bezieres-Landes Railway, -- single\n      track from Tourgas. The Prussians shelled it out in '70 because there was\n      a poplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church\n      spire. There's a squadron of cavalry quartered there, -- or ought to\n      be. Where this studio Torp spoke about may be I cannot tell. That is\n      Torp's business. I have given him his route. He will dispassionately\n      explain the situation to the girl, and she will come back to Dick, -- the\n      more especially because, to use Dick's words, 'there is nothing but her\n      damned obstinacy to keep them apart.'\"",
                "\"And they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between 'em.\"",
                "Dick never lost his head for figures, even in his delirium. \"You haven't\n      the shadow of an excuse for not going,\" said the Nilghai.",
                "Torpenhow looked very uncomfortable. \"But it's absurd and impossible. I\n      can't drag her back by the hair.\"",
                "\"Our business -- the business for which we draw our money -- is to\n      do absurd and impossible things, -- generally with no reason whatever\n      except to amuse the public. Here we have a reason. The rest doesn't\n      matter. I shall share these rooms with the Nilghai till Torpenhow returns.\n      There will be a batch of unbridled 'specials' coming to town in a little\n      while, and these will serve as their headquarters. Another reason for\n      sending Torpenhow away. Thus Providence helps those who help others, and\" -- here\n      the Keneu dropped his measured speech -- \"we can't have you tied by the\n      leg to Dick when the trouble begins. It's your only chance of getting\n      away; and Dick will be grateful.\"",
                "\"He will, -- worse luck! I can but go and try. I can't conceive a woman\n      in her senses refusing Dick.\"",
                "\"Talk that out with the girl. I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh\n      woman into giving you dates. This won't be a tithe as difficult. You had\n      better not be here tomorrow afternoon, because the Nilghai and I will be\n      in possession. It is an order. Obey.\"",
                "\"Dick,\" said Torpenhow, next morning, \"can I do anything for you?\"",
                "\"No! Leave me alone. How often must I remind you that I'm blind?\"",
                "\"Nothing I could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring?\"",
                "\"No. Take those infernal creaking boots of yours away.\"",
                "\"Poor chap!\" said Torpenhow to himself. \"I must have been sitting on his\n      nerves lately. He wants a lighter step.\" Then, aloud, \"Very well. Since\n      you're so independent, I'm going off for four or five days. Say goodbye at\n      least. The housekeeper will look after you, and Keneu has my rooms.\"",
                "Dick's face fell. \"You won't be longer than a week at the outside? I know\n      I'm touched in the temper, but I can't get on without you.\"",
                "\"Can't you? You'll have to do without me in a little time, and you'll be\n      glad I'm gone.\"",
                "Dick felt his way back to the big chair, and wondered what these things\n      might mean. He did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper, and yet\n      Torpenhow's constant tenderness jarred on him. He did not exactly know\n      what he wanted. The darkness would not lift, and Maisie's unopened letters\n      felt worn and old from much handling. He could never read them for himself\n      as long as life endured; but Maisie might have sent him some fresh ones to\n      play with. The Nilghai entered with a gift, -- a piece of red\n      modelling-wax. He fancied that Dick might find interest in using his\n      hands. Dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes, and, \"Is it like\n      anything in the world?\" he said drearily. \"Take it away. I may get the\n      touch of the blind in fifty years. Do you know where Torpenhow has gone?\"",
                "The Nilghai knew nothing. \"We're staying in his rooms till he comes back.\n      Can we do anything for you?\"",
                "\"I'd like to be left alone, please. Don't think I'm ungrateful; but I'm\n      best alone.\"",
                "The Nilghai chuckled, and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen\n      rebellion against fate. He had long since ceased to think about the work\n      he had done in the old days, and the desire to do more work had departed\n      from him. He was exceedingly sorry for himself, and the completeness of\n      his tender grief soothed him. But his soul and his body cried for Maisie -- Maisie\n      who would understand. His mind pointed out that Maisie, having her own\n      work to do, would not care. His experience had taught him that when money\n      was exhausted women went away, and that when a man was knocked out of the\n      race the others trampled on him. \"Then at the least,\" said Dick, in reply,\n      \"she could use me as I used Binat, -- for some sort of a study. I\n      wouldn't ask more than to be near her again, even though I knew that\n      another man was making love to her. Ugh! what a dog I am!\"",
                "A voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully --",
                "\"When we go -- go -- go away from here, Our creditors will weep and\n      they will wail, Our absence much regretting when they find that we've been\n      getting Out of England by next Tuesday's Indian mail.\"",
                "Following the trampling of feet, slamming of Torpenhow's door, and the\n      sound of voices in strenuous debate, some one squeaked, \"And see, you good\n      fellows, I have found a new water-bottle -- firs'-class patent -- eh,\n      how you say? Open himself inside out.\"",
                "Dick sprang to his feet. He knew the voice well. \"That's Cassavetti, come\n      back from the Continent. Now I know why Torp went away. There's a row\n      somewhere, and -- I'm out of it!\"",
                "The Nilghai commanded silence in vain. \"That's for my sake,\" Dick said\n      bitterly. \"The birds are getting ready to fly, and they wouldn't tell me.\n      I can hear Morten-Sutherland and Mackaye. Half the War Correspondents in\n      London are there; -- and I'm out of it.\"",
                "He stumbled across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow's room. He could\n      feel that it was full of men. \"Where's the trouble?\" said he. \"In the\n      Balkans at last? Why didn't some one tell me?\"",
                "\"We thought you wouldn't be interested,\" said the Nilghai, shamefacedly.",
                "\"It's in the Soudan, as usual.\"",
                "\"You lucky dogs! Let me sit here while you talk. I shan't be a skeleton at\n      the feast. -- Cassavetti, where are you? Your English is as bad as\n      ever.\"",
                "Dick was led into a chair. He heard the rustle of the maps, and the talk\n      swept forward, carrying him with it. Everybody spoke at once, discussing\n      press censorships, railway-routes, transport, water-supply, the capacities\n      of generals, -- these in language that would have horrified a trusting\n      public, -- ranting, asserting, denouncing, and laughing at the top of\n      their voices. There was the glorious certainty of war in the Soudan at any\n      moment. The Nilghai said so, and it was well to be in readiness. The Keneu\n      had telegraphed to Cairo for horses; Cassavetti had stolen a perfectly\n      inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered forward, and was reading\n      it out amid profane interruptions, and the Keneu introduced to Dick some\n      man unknown who would be employed as war artist by the Central Southern\n      Syndicate. \"It's his first outing,\" said the Keneu. \"Give him some tips -- about\n      riding camels.\"",
                "\"Oh, those camels!\" groaned Cassavetti. \"I shall learn to ride him again,\n      and now I am so much all soft! Listen, you good fellows. I know your\n      military arrangement very well. There will go the Royal Argalshire\n      Sutherlanders. So it was read to me upon best authority.\"",
                "A roar of laughter interrupted him.",
                "\"Sit down,\" said the Nilghai. \"The lists aren't even made out in the War\n      Office.\"",
                "\"Will there be any force at Suakin?\" said a voice.",
                "Then the outcries redoubled, and grew mixed, thus: \"How many Egyptian\n      troops will they use? -- God help the Fellaheen! -- There's a\n      railway in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fives-court. -- We shall\n      have the Suakin-Berber line built at last. -- Canadian voyageurs are\n      too careful. Give me a half-drunk Krooman in a whale-boat. -- Who\n      commands the Desert column? -- No, they never blew up the big rock in\n      the Ghineh bend. We shall have to be hauled up, as usual. -- Somebody\n      tell me if there's an Indian contingent, or I'll break everybody's head. -- Don't\n      tear the map in two. -- It's a war of occupation, I tell you, to\n      connect with the African companies in the South. -- There's Guinea-worm\n      in most of the wells on that route.\" Then the Nilghai, despairing of\n      peace, bellowed like a fog-horn and beat upon the table with both hands.",
                "\"But what becomes of Torpenhow?\" said Dick, in the silence that followed.",
                "\"Torp's in abeyance just now. He's off love-making somewhere, I suppose,\"\n       said the Nilghai.",
                "\"He said he was going to stay at home,\" said the Keneu.",
                "\"Is he?\" said Dick, with an oath. \"He won't. I'm not much good now, but if\n      you and the Nilghai hold him down I'll engage to trample on him till he\n      sees reason. He'll stay behind, indeed! He's the best of you all. There'll\n      be some tough work by Omdurman. We shall come there to stay, this time.",
                "\"But I forgot. I wish I were going with you.\"",
                "\"So do we all, Dickie,\" said the Keneu.",
                "\"And I most of all,\" said the new artist of the Central Southern\n      Syndicate.",
                "\"Could you tell me --  -- \"",
                "\"I'll give you one piece of advice,\" Dick answered, moving towards the\n      door. \"If you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage, don't guard.\n      Tell the man to go on cutting. You'll find it cheapest in the end. Thanks\n      for letting me look in.\"",
                "\"There's grit in Dick,\" said the Nilghai, an hour later, when the room was\n      emptied of all save the Keneu.",
                "\"It was the sacred call of the war-trumpet. Did you notice how he answered\n      to it? Poor fellow! Let's look at him,\" said the Keneu.",
                "The excitement of the talk had died away. Dick was sitting by the studio\n      table, with his head on his arms, when the men came in. He did not change\n      his position.",
                "\"It hurts,\" he moaned. \"God forgive me, but it hurts cruelly; and yet,\n      y'know, the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself. Shall I see\n      Torp before he goes?\"",
                "\"Oh, yes. You'll see him,\" said the Nilghai."

                "Maisie put her elbows on the window-sill and looked at the moonlight on\n      the straight, poplar-flanked road. Summer had come upon Vitry-sur-Marne\n      and parched it to the bone. The grass was dry-burnt in the meadows, the\n      clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick, the roadside flowers\n      were long since dead, and the roses in the garden hung withered on their\n      stalks. The heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost\n      intolerable. The very moonlight on the wall of Kami's studio across the\n      road seemed to make the night hotter, and the shadow of the big\n      bell-handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught\n      Maisie's eye and annoyed her.",
                "\"Horrid thing! It should be all white,\" she murmured. \"And the gate isn't\n      in the middle of the wall, either. I never noticed that before.\"",
                "Maisie was hard to please at that hour. First, the heat of the past few\n      weeks had worn her down; secondly, her work, and particularly the study of\n      a female head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished in\n      time for the Salon, was unsatisfactory; thirdly, Kami had said as much two\n      days before; fourthly, -- but so completely fourthly that it was hardly\n      worth thinking about, -- Dick, her property, had not written to her for\n      more than six weeks. She was angry with the heat, with Kami, and with her\n      work, but she was exceedingly angry with Dick.",
                "She had written to him three times, -- each time proposing a fresh\n      treatment of her Melancolia. Dick had taken no notice of these\n      communications. She had resolved to write no more. When she returned to\n      England in the autumn -- for her pride's sake she could not return\n      earlier -- she would speak to him. She missed the Sunday afternoon\n      conferences more than she cared to admit. All that Kami said was,\n      \"Continuez, mademoiselle, continuez toujours,\" and he had been repeating\n      the wearisome counsel through the hot summer, exactly like a cicada, -- an\n      old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat, white trousers, and a huge felt\n      hat.",
                "But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north of\n      the cool green London park, and had said things ten times worse than\n      continuez, before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her\n      where the error lay. His last letter, Maisie remembered, contained some\n      trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at wayside\n      farmhouses; and he had said that not once, but three times, -- as if he\n      did not know that Maisie could take care of herself.",
                "But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write? A murmur of\n      voices in the road made her lean from the window. A cavalryman of the\n      little garrison in the town was talking to Kami's cook. The moonlight\n      glittered on the scabbard of his sabre, which he was holding in his hand\n      lest it should clank inopportunely. The cook's cap cast deep shadows on\n      her face, which was close to the conscript's. He slid his arm round her\n      waist, and there followed the sound of a kiss.",
                "\"Faugh!\" said Maisie, stepping back.",
                "\"What's that?\" said the red-haired girl, who was tossing uneasily outside\n      her bed.",
                "\"Only a conscript kissing the cook,\" said Maisie.",
                "\"They've gone away now.\" She leaned out of the window again, and put a\n      shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills. There was a very small\n      night-breeze abroad, and a sun-baked rose below nodded its head as one who\n      knew unutterable secrets. Was it possible that Dick should turn his\n      thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of\n      Suzanne and the conscript? He could not! The rose nodded its head and one\n      leaf therewith. It looked like a naughty little devil scratching its ear.",
                "Dick could not, \"because,\" thought Maisie, \"he is mine, -- mine, -- mine.\n      He said he was. I'm sure I don't care what he does. It will only spoil his\n      work if he does; and it will spoil mine too.\"",
                "The rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers. There was\n      no earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose, except\n      that he was called by Providence, which was Maisie, to assist Maisie in\n      her work. And her work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes\n      to English provincial exhibitions, as the notices in the scrap-book\n      proved, and that were invariably rejected by the Salon when Kami was\n      plagued into allowing her to send them up. Her work in the future, it\n      seemed, would be the preparation of pictures on exactly similar lines\n      which would be rejected in exactly the same way --  -- The\n      red-haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets. \"It's too hot to\n      sleep,\" she moaned; and the interruption jarred.",
                "Exactly the same way. Then she would divide her years between the little\n      studio in England and Kami's big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No, she would\n      go to another master, who should force her into the success that was her\n      right, if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to\n      anything. Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to understand his\n      craft. She had worked ten years, and ten years were nothing. Dick had said\n      that ten years were nothing, -- but that was in regard to herself only.\n      He had said -- this very man who could not find time to write -- that\n      he would wait ten years for her, and that she was bound to come back to\n      him sooner or later. He had said this in the absurd letter about sunstroke\n      and diphtheria; and then he had stopped writing. He was wandering up and\n      down moonlit streets, kissing cooks. She would like to lecture him now, -- not\n      in her nightgown, of course, but properly dressed, severely and from a\n      height. Yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly would not care\n      whether she lecture him or not. He would laugh at her. Very good.",
                "She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went, etc., etc.",
                "The mill-wheel of thought swung round slowly, that no section of it might\n      be slurred over, and the red-haired girl tossed and turned behind her.",
                "Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt\n      whatever of the villainy of Dick. To justify herself, she began,\n      unwomanly, to weigh the evidence. There was a boy, and he had said he\n      loved her. And he kissed her, -- kissed her on the cheek, -- by a\n      yellow sea-poppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose\n      in the garden. Then there was an interval, and men had told her that they\n      loved her -- just when she was busiest with her work. Then the boy came\n      back, and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her.\n      Then he had --  -- But there was no end to the things he had done.\n      He had given her his time and his powers. He had spoken to her of Art,\n      housekeeping, technique, teacups, the abuse of pickles as a stimulant, -- that\n      was rude, -- sable hair-brushes, -- he had given her the best in her\n      stock, -- she used them daily; he had given her advice that she\n      profited by, and now and again -- a look. Such a look! The look of a\n      beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistress's feet. In\n      return she had given him nothing whatever, except -- here she brushed\n      her mouth against the open-work sleeve of her nightgown -- the\n      privilege of kissing her once. And on the mouth, too. Disgraceful! Was\n      that not enough, and more than enough? and if it was not, had he not\n      cancelled the debt by not writing and -- probably kissing other girls?\n      \"Maisie, you'll catch a chill. Do go and lie down,\" said the wearied voice\n      of her companion. \"I can't sleep a wink with you at the window.\"",
                "Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. She was reflecting on\n      the meannesses of Dick, and on other meannesses with which he had nothing\n      to do. The moonlight would not let her sleep. It lay on the skylight of\n      the studio across the road in cold silver; she stared at it intently and\n      her thoughts began to slide one into the other. The shadow of the big\n      bell-handle in the wall grew short, lengthened again, and faded out as the\n      moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came limping home across the\n      road. Then the dawn-wind washed through the upland grasses, and brought\n      coolness with it, and the cattle lowed by the drought-shrunk river.\n      Maisie's head fell forward on the window-sill, and the tangle of black\n      hair covered her arms.",
                "\"Maisie, wake up. You'll catch a chill.\"",
                "\"Yes, dear; yes, dear.\" She staggered to her bed like a wearied child, and\n      as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered, \"I think -- I think -- But\n      he ought to have written.\"",
                "Day brought the routine of the studio, the smell of paint and turpentine,\n      and the monotone wisdom of Kami, who was a leaden artist, but a golden\n      teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him. Maisie was not in\n      sympathy that day, and she waited impatiently for the end of the work.",
                "She knew when it was coming; for Kami would gather his black alpaca coat\n      into a bunch behind him, and, with faded flue eyes that saw neither pupils\n      nor canvas, look back into the past to recall the history of one Binat.\n      \"You have all done not so badly,\" he would say. \"But you shall remember\n      that it is not enough to have the method, and the art, and the power, nor\n      even that which is touch, but you shall have also the conviction that\n      nails the work to the wall. Of the so many I taught,\" -- here the\n      students would begin to unfix drawing-pins or get their tubes together, -- \"the\n      very so many that I have taught, the best was Binat. All that comes of the\n      study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came. After\n      he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour, the\n      form, and the knowledge. Only, he had not the conviction. So today I hear\n      no more of Binat, -- the best of my pupils, -- and that is long ago.\n      So today, too, you will be glad to hear no more of me. Continuez,\n      mesdemoiselles, and, above all, with conviction.\"",
                "He went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the\n      pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to\n      make plans for the cool of the afternoon.",
                "Maisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia, restrained a desire to\n      grimace before it, and was hurrying across the road to write a letter to\n      Dick, when she was aware of a large man on a white troop-horse. How\n      Torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to the\n      hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at Vitry-sur-Marne, to discuss\n      with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for France, to reduce the\n      colonel to tears of pure affability, and to borrow the best horse in the\n      squadron for the journey to Kami's studio, is a mystery that only special\n      correspondents can unravel.",
                "\"I beg your pardon,\" said he. \"It seems an absurd question to ask, but the\n      fact is that I don't know her by any other name: Is there any young lady\n      here that is called Maisie?\"",
                "\"I am Maisie,\" was the answer from the depths of a great sun-hat.",
                "\"I ought to introduce myself,\" he said, as the horse capered in the\n      blinding white dust. \"My name is Torpenhow. Dick Heldar is my best friend,\n      and -- and -- the fact is that he has gone blind.\"",
                "\"Blind!\" said Maisie, stupidly. \"He can't be blind.\"",
                "\"He has been stone-blind for nearly two months.\"",
                "Maisie lifted up her face, and it was pearly white. \"No! No! Not blind! I\n      won't have him blind!\"",
                "\"Would you care to see for yourself?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Now, -- at once?\"",
                "\"Oh, no! The Paris train doesn't go through this place till tonight. There\n      will be ample time.\"",
                "\"Did Mr. Heldar send you to me?\"",
                "\"Certainly not. Dick wouldn't do that sort of thing. He's sitting in his\n      studio, turning over some letters that he can't read because he's blind.\"",
                "There was a sound of choking from the sun-hat. Maisie bowed her head and\n      went into the cottage, where the red-haired girl was on a sofa,\n      complaining of a headache.",
                "\"Dick's blind!\" said Maisie, taking her breath quickly as she steadied\n      herself against a chair-back. \"My Dick's blind!\"",
                "\"What?\" The girl was on the sofa no longer.",
                "\"A man has come from England to tell me. He hasn't written to me for six\n      weeks.\"",
                "\"Are you going to him?\"",
                "\"I must think.\"",
                "\"Think! I should go back to London and see him and I should kiss his eyes\n      and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again! If you don't go I\n      shall. Oh, what am I talking about? You wicked little idiot! Go to him at\n      once. Go!\"",
                "Torpenhow's neck was blistering, but he preserved a smile of infinite\n      patience as Maisie's appeared bareheaded in the sunshine.",
                "\"I am coming,\" said she, her eyes on the ground.",
                "\"You will be at Vitry Station, then, at seven this evening.\" This was an\n      order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed. Maisie said nothing,\n      but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing with this big\n      man who took everything for granted and managed a squealing horse with one\n      hand. She returned to the red-haired girl, who was weeping bitterly, and\n      between tears, kisses, -- very few of those, -- menthol, packing,\n      and an interview with Kami, the sultry afternoon wore away.",
                "Thought might come afterwards. Her present duty was to go to Dick, -- Dick\n      who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her\n      unopened letters.",
                "\"But what will you do,\" she said to her companion.",
                "\"I? Oh, I shall stay here and -- finish your Melancolia,\" she said,\n      smiling pitifully. \"Write to me afterwards.\"",
                "That night there ran a legend through Vitry-sur-Marne of a mad Englishman,\n      doubtless suffering from sunstroke, who had drunk all the officers of the\n      garrison under the table, had borrowed a horse from the lines, and had\n      then and there eloped, after the English custom, with one of those more\n      mad English girls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good\n      Monsieur Kami.",
                "\"They are very droll,\" said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight by\n      the studio wall. \"She walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing,\n      and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister, and\n      gives me -- see -- ten francs!\"",
                "The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts; for he prided himself\n      on being a good soldier.",
                "Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais; but he\n      was careful to attend to all her wants, to get her a compartment entirely\n      to herself, and to leave her alone. He was amazed of the ease with which\n      the matter had been accomplished.",
                "\"The safest thing would be to let her think things out. By Dick's showing, -- when\n      he was off his head, -- she must have ordered him about very\n      thoroughly. Wonder how she likes being under orders.\"",
                "Maisie never told. She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes\n      shut, that she might realise the sensation of blindness. It was an order\n      that she should return to London swiftly, and she found herself at last\n      almost beginning to enjoy the situation. This was better than looking\n      after luggage and a red-haired friend who never took any interest in her\n      surroundings. But there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she,\n      Maisie, -- of all people, -- was in disgrace. Therefore she\n      justified her conduct to herself with great success, till Torpenhow came\n      up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of\n      Dick's blindness, suppressing a few details, but dwelling at length on the\n      miseries of delirium. He stopped before he reached the end, as though he\n      had lost interest in the subject, and went forward to smoke. Maisie was\n      furious with him and with herself.",
                "She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for\n      breakfast, and -- she was past any feeling of indignation now -- was\n      bidden curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead-covered stairs\n      while Torpenhow went up to make inquiries. Again the knowledge that she\n      was being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame.\n      It was all Dick's fault for being so stupid as to go blind.",
                "Torpenhow led her up to a shut door, which he opened very softly. Dick was\n      sitting by the window, with his chin on his chest. There were three\n      envelopes in his hand, and he turned them over and over. The big man who\n      gave orders was no longer by her side, and the studio door snapped behind\n      her.",
                "Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound. \"Hullo,\n      Torp! Is that you? I've been so lonely.\"",
                "His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed\n      herself up into a corner of the room. Her heart was beating furiously, and\n      she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring directly\n      at her, and she realised for the first time that he was blind.",
                "Shutting her eyes in a rail-way carriage to open them when she pleased was\n      child's play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.",
                "\"Torp, is that you? They said you were coming.\" Dick looked puzzled and a\n      little irritated at the silence.",
                "\"No; it's only me,\" was the answer, in a strained little whisper. Maisie\n      could hardly move her lips.",
                "\"H'm!\" said Dick, composedly, without moving. \"This is a new phenomenon.\n      Darkness I'm getting used to; but I object to hearing voices.\"",
                "Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself? Maisie's\n      heart beat more wildly, and she breathed in gasps. Dick rose and began to\n      feel his way across the room, touching each table and chair as he passed.\n      Once he caught his foot on a rug, and swore, dropping on his knees to feel\n      what the obstruction might be. Maisie remembered him walking in the Park\n      as though all the earth belonged to him, tramping up and down her studio\n      two months ago, and flying up the gangway of the Channel steamer. The\n      beating of her heart was making her sick, and Dick was coming nearer,\n      guided by the sound of her breathing. She put out a hand mechanically to\n      ward him off or to draw him to herself, she did not know which. It touched\n      his chest, and he stepped back as though he had been shot.",
                "\"It's Maisie!\" said he, with a dry sob. \"What are you doing here?\"",
                "\"I came -- I came -- to see you, please.\"",
                "Dick's lips closed firmly.",
                "\"Won't you sit down, then? You see, I've had some bother with my eyes, and --  -- \"",
                "\"I know. I know. Why didn't you tell me?\"",
                "\"I couldn't write.\"",
                "\"You might have told Mr. Torpenhow.\"",
                "\"What has he to do with my affairs?\"",
                "\"He -- he brought me from Vitry-sur-Marne. He thought I ought to see\n      you.\"",
                "\"Why, what has happened? Can I do anything for you? No, I can't. I\n      forgot.\"",
                "\"Oh, Dick, I'm so sorry! I've come to tell you, and --  -- Let me\n      take you back to your chair.\"",
                "\"Don't! I'm not a child. You only do that out of pity. I never meant to\n      tell you anything about it. I'm no good now. I'm down and done for. Let me\n      alone!\"",
                "He groped back to his chair, his chest labouring as he sat down.",
                "Maisie watched him, and the fear went out of her heart, to be followed by\n      a very bitter shame. He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the\n      girl through every step of the impetuous flight to London; for he was,\n      indeed, down and done for -- masterful no longer but rather a little\n      abject; neither an artist stronger than she, nor a man to be looked up to -- only\n      some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of crying. She\n      was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for him -- more sorry than she had\n      ever been for any one in her life, but not sorry enough to deny his words.",
                "So she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt, because she had\n      honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly; and now she\n      was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love.",
                "\"Well?\" said Dick, his face steadily turned away. \"I never meant to worry\n      you any more. What's the matter?\"",
                "He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as\n      unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed. She had\n      dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.",
                "\"I can't -- I can't!\" she cried desperately. \"Indeed, I can't. It isn't\n      my fault. I'm so sorry. Oh, Dickie, I'm so sorry.\"",
                "Dick's shoulders straightened again, for the words lashed like a whip.",
                "Still the sobbing continued. It is not good to realise that you have\n      failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of\n      making sacrifices.",
                "\"I do despise myself -- indeed I do. But I can't. Oh, Dickie, you\n      wouldn't ask me -- would you?\" wailed Maisie.",
                "She looked up for a minute, and by chance it happened that Dick's eyes\n      fell on hers. The unshaven face was very white and set, and the lips were\n      trying to force themselves into a smile. But it was the worn-out eyes that\n      Maisie feared. Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place some one that\n      she could hardly recognise till he spoke.",
                "\"Who is asking you to do anything, Maisie? I told you how it would be.\n      What's the use of worrying? For pity's sake don't cry like that; it isn't\n      worth it.\"",
                "\"You don't know how I hate myself. Oh, Dick, help me -- help me!\" The\n      passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm\n      the man. He stumbled forward and put his arm round her, and her head fell\n      on his shoulder.",
                "\"Hush, dear, hush! Don't cry. You're quite right, and you've nothing to\n      reproach yourself with -- you never had. You're only a little upset by\n      the journey, and I don't suppose you've had any breakfast. What a brute\n      Torp was to bring you over.\"",
                "\"I wanted to come. I did indeed,\" she protested.",
                "\"Very well. And now you've come and seen, and I'm -- immensely\n      grateful. When you're better you shall go away and get something to eat.\n      What sort of a passage did you have coming over?\"",
                "Maisie was crying more subduedly, for the first time in her life glad that\n      she had something to lean against. Dick patted her on the shoulder\n      tenderly but clumsily, for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might\n      be.",
                "She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited, trembling and most\n      unhappy. He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room\n      between them, and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart.",
                "\"Are you better now?\" he said.",
                "\"Yes, but -- don't you hate me?\"",
                "\"I hate you? My God! I?\"",
                "\"Isn't -- isn't there anything I could do for you, then? I'll stay here\n      in England to do it, if you like. Perhaps I could come and see you\n      sometimes.\"",
                "\"I think not, dear. It would be kindest not to see me any more, please. I\n      don't want to seem rude, but -- don't you think -- perhaps you had\n      almost better go now.\"",
                "He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain\n      continued much longer.",
                "\"I don't deserve anything else. I'll go, Dick. Oh, I'm so miserable.\"",
                "\"Nonsense. You've nothing to worry about; I'd tell you if you had. Wait a\n      moment, dear. I've got something to give you first. I meant it for you\n      ever since this little trouble began. It's my Melancolia; she was a beauty\n      when I last saw her. You can keep her for me, and if ever you're poor you\n      can sell her. She's worth a few hundreds at any state of the market.\" He\n      groped among his canvases. \"She's framed in black. Is this a black frame\n      that I have my hand on? There she is. What do you think of her?\"",
                "He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, and the eyes\n      strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One thing and\n      one thing only could she do for him.",
                "\"Well?\"",
                "The voice was fuller and more rounded, because the man knew he was\n      speaking of his best work. Maisie looked at the blur, and a lunatic desire\n      to laugh caught her by the throat. But for Dick's sake -- whatever this\n      mad blankness might mean -- she must make no sign. Her voice choked\n      with hard-held tears as she answered, still gazing at the wreck -- \"Oh,\n      Dick, it is good!\"",
                "He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute. \"Won't you\n      have it, then? I'll send it over to your house if you will.\"",
                "\"I? Oh yes -- thank you. Ha! ha!\" If she did not fly at once the\n      laughter that was worse than tears would kill her. She turned and ran,\n      choking and blinded, down the staircases that were empty of life to take\n      refuge in a cab and go to her house across the Parks. There she sat down\n      in the dismantled drawing-room and thought of Dick in his blindness,\n      useless till the end of life, and of herself in her own eyes. Behind the\n      sorrow, the shame, and the humiliation, lay fear of the cold wrath of the\n      red-haired girl when Maisie should return. Maisie had never feared her\n      companion before. Not until she found herself saying, \"Well, he never\n      asked me,\" did she realise her scorn of herself. And that is the end of\n      Maisie.",
                "For Dick was reserved more searching torment. He could not realise at\n      first that Maisie, whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word\n      of farewell. He was savagely angry against Torpenhow, who had brought upon\n      him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace. Then his dark hour\n      came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he\n      could from the darkness. The queen could do no wrong, but in following the\n      right, so far as it served her work, she had wounded her one subject more\n      than his own brain would let him know.",
                "\"It's all I had and I've lost it,\" he said, as soon as the misery\n      permitted clear thinking. \"And Torp will think that he has been so\n      infernally clever that I shan't have the heart to tell him. I must think\n      this out quietly.\"",
                "\"Hullo!\" said Torpenhow, entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two\n      hours of thought. \"I'm back. Are you feeling any better?\"",
                "\"Torp, I don't know what to say. Come here.\" Dick coughed huskily,\n      wondering, indeed, what he should say, and how to say it temperately.",
                "\"What's the need for saying anything? Get up and tramp.\" Torpenhow was\n      perfectly satisfied.",
                "They walked up and down as of custom, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's shoulder,\n      and Dick buried in his own thoughts.",
                "\"How in the world did you find it all out?\" said Dick, at last.",
                "\"You shouldn't go off your head if you want to keep secrets, Dickie. It\n      was absolutely impertinent on my part; but if you'd seen me rocketing\n      about on a half-trained French troop-horse under a blazing sun you'd have\n      laughed. There will be a charivari in my rooms tonight. Seven other devils --  -- \"",
                "\"I know -- the row in the Southern Soudan. I surprised their councils\n      the other day, and it made me unhappy. Have you fixed your flint to go?\n      Who d'you work for?\"",
                "\"Haven't signed any contracts yet. I wanted to see how your business would\n      turn out.\"",
                "\"Would you have stayed with me, then, if -- things had gone wrong?\" He\n      put his question cautiously.",
                "\"Don't ask me too much. I'm only a man.\"",
                "\"You've tried to be an angel very successfully.\"",
                "\"Oh ye -- es!... Well, do you attend the function tonight? We shall be\n      half screwed before the morning. All the men believe the war's a\n      certainty.\"",
                "\"I don't think I will, old man, if it's all the same to you. I'll stay\n      quiet here.\"",
                "\"And meditate? I don't blame you. You observe a good time if ever a man\n      did.\"",
                "That night there was a tumult on the stairs. The correspondents poured in\n      from theatre, dinner, and music-hall to Torpenhow's room that they might\n      discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations\n      becoming a certainty. Torpenhow, the Keneu, and the Nilghai had bidden all\n      the men they had worked with to the orgy; and Mr. Beeton, the housekeeper,\n      declared that never before in his checkered experience had he seen quite\n      such a fancy lot of gentlemen. They waked the chambers with shoutings and\n      song; and the elder men were quite as bad as the younger. For the chances\n      of war were in front of them, and all knew what those meant.",
                "Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the\n      landing, Dick suddenly began to laugh to himself.",
                "\"When one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic. Maisie's\n      quite right -- poor little thing. I didn't know she could cry like that\n      before; but now I know what Torp thinks, I'm sure he'd be quite fool\n      enough to stay at home and try to console me -- if he knew. Besides, it\n      isn't nice to own that you've been thrown over like a broken chair. I must\n      carry this business through alone -- as usual. If there isn't a war,\n      and Torp finds out, I shall look foolish, that's all. If there is a way I\n      mustn't interfere with another man's chances. Business is business, and I\n      want to be alone -- I want to be alone. What a row they're making!\"",
                "Somebody hammered at the studio door.",
                "\"Come out and frolic, Dickie,\" said the Nilghai.",
                "\"I should like to, but I can't. I'm not feeling frolicsome.\"",
                "\"Then, I'll tell the boys and they'll drag you like a badger.\"",
                "\"Please not, old man. On my word, I'd sooner be left alone just now.\"",
                "\"Very good. Can we send anything in to you? Fizz, for instance. Cassavetti\n      is beginning to sing songs of the Sunny South already.\"",
                "For one minute Dick considered the proposition seriously.",
                "\"No, thanks, I've a headache already.\"",
                "\"Virtuous child. That's the effect of emotion on the young. All my\n      congratulations, Dick. I also was concerned in the conspiracy for your\n      welfare.\"",
                "\"Go to the devil -- oh, send Binkie in here.\"",
                "The little dog entered on elastic feet, riotous from having been made much\n      of all the evening. He had helped to sing the choruses; but scarcely\n      inside the studio he realised that this was no place for tail-wagging, and\n      settled himself on Dick's lap till it was bedtime. Then he went to bed\n      with Dick, who counted every hour as it struck, and rose in the morning\n      with a painfully clear head to receive Torpenhow's more formal\n      congratulations and a particular account of the last night's revels.",
                "\"You aren't looking very happy for a newly accepted man,\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Never mind that -- it's my own affair, and I'm all right. Do you\n      really go?\"",
                "\"Yes. With the old Central Southern as usual. They wired, and I accepted\n      on better terms than before.\"",
                "\"When do you start?\"",
                "\"The day after tomorrow -- for Brindisi.\"",
                "\"Thank God.\" Dick spoke from the bottom of his heart.",
                "\"Well, that's not a pretty way of saying you're glad to get rid of me. But\n      men in your condition are allowed to be selfish.\"",
                "\"I didn't mean that. Will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before\n      you leave?\"",
                "\"That's a slender amount for housekeeping, isn't it?\"",
                "\"Oh, it's only for -- marriage expenses.\"",
                "Torpenhow brought him the money, counted it out in fives and tens, and\n      carefully put it away in the writing table.",
                "\"Now I suppose I shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl until\n      I go. Heaven send us patience with a man in love!\" he said to himself.",
                "But never a word did Dick say of Maisie or marriage. He hung in the\n      doorway of Torpenhow's room when the latter was packing and asked\n      innumerable questions about the coming campaign, till Torpenhow began to\n      feel annoyed.",
                "\"You're a secretive animal, Dickie, and you consume your own smoke, don't\n      you?\" he said on the last evening.",

                "\"You might be going to be hanged by the look of you,\" said Torpenhow.",

                "\"No!\" Dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his\n      temper was of the shortest.",

Don't I?\"",
                "\"Ah! That must have been a mad-house. I shan't trouble you to take me\n      there yet. Get me my breakfast, please, and leave me alone.\"",
                "\"I hope I haven't done anything wrong, sir, but you know I hope that as\n      far as a man can I tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in\n      chambers -- and more particular those whose lot is hard -- such as\n      you, for instance, Mr. Heldar. You likes soft-roe bloater, don't you?\n      Soft-roe bloaters is scarcer than hard-roe, but what I says is, 'Never\n      mind a little extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the\n      tenants.'\"",
                "Mr. Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself. Torpenhow had been long\n      away; there was no more rioting in the chambers, and Dick had settled down\n      to his new life, which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than\n      death.",
                "It is hard to live alone in the dark, confusing the day and night;\n      dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at mid-day, and rising restless\n      in the chill of the dawn. At first Dick, on his awakenings, would grope\n      along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one snore. Then he\n      would know that the day had not yet come, and return wearily to his\n      bedroom.",
                "Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the\n      house and Mr. Beeton advised him to get up. Once dressed -- and\n      dressing, now that Torpenhow was away, was a lengthy business, because\n      collars, ties, and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room, and\n      search meant head-beating against chairs and trunks -- once dressed,\n      there was nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the\n      three daily meals came. Centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch\n      from dinner, and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his mind\n      might be taken from him, God would never hear. Rather the mind was\n      quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as\n      millstones grind when there is no corn between; and yet the brain would\n      not wear out and give him rest. It continued to think, at length, with\n      imagery and all manner of reminiscences. It recalled Maisie and past\n      success, reckless travels by land and sea, the glory of doing work and\n      feeling that it was good, and suggested all that might have happened had\n      the eyes only been faithful to their duty. When thinking ceased through\n      sheer weariness, there poured into Dick's soul tide on tide of\n      overwhelming, purposeless fear -- dread of starvation always, terror\n      lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him, fear of fire in the\n      chambers and a louse's death in red flame, and agonies of fiercer horror\n      that had nothing to do with any fear of death. Then Dick bowed his head,\n      and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till the\n      tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before him.",
                "Mr. Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare, and Dick\n      learned to hang upon his speech, which dealt with badly fitted gas-plugs,\n      waste-pipes out of repair, little tricks for driving picture-nails into\n      walls, and the sins of the charwoman or the housemaids. In the lack of\n      better things the small gossip of a servants' hall becomes immensely\n      interesting, and the screwing of a washer on a tap an event to be talked\n      over for days.",
                "Once or twice a week, too, Mr. Beeton would take Dick out with him when he\n      went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish,\n      lamp-wicks, mustard, tapioca, and so forth, while Dick rested his weight\n      first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins\n      and string-ball on the counter. Then they would perhaps meet one of Mr.\n      Beeton's friends, and Dick, standing aside a little, would hold his peace\n      till Mr. Beeton was willing to go on again.",
                "The life did not increase his self-respect. He abandoned shaving as a\n      dangerous exercise, and being shaved in a barber's shop meant exposure of\n      his infirmity. He could not see that his clothes were properly brushed,\n      and since he had never taken any care of his personal appearance he became\n      every known variety of sloven. A blind man cannot deal with cleanliness\n      till he has been some months used to the darkness. If he demand attendance\n      and grow angry at the want of it, he must assert himself and stand\n      upright. Then the meanest menial can see that he is blind and, therefore,\n      of no consequence. A wise man will keep his eyes on the floor and sit\n      still. For amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the scuttle with\n      the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender, keeping count of the\n      lumps, which must all be put back again, one by one and very carefully. He\n      may set himself sums if he cares to work them out; he may talk to himself\n      or to the cat if she chooses to visit him; and if his trade has been that\n      of an artist, he may sketch in the air with his forefinger; but that is\n      too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut. He may go to his\n      bookshelves and count his books, ranging them in order of their size; or\n      to his wardrobe and count his shirts, laying them in piles of two or three\n      on the bed, as they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons.",
                "Even this entertainment wearies after a time; and all the times are very,\n      very long.",
                "Dick was allowed to sort a tool-chest where Mr. Beeton kept hammers, taps\n      and nuts, lengths of gas-pipes, oil-bottles, and string.",
                "\"If I don't have everything just where I know where to look for it, why,\n      then, I can't find anything when I do want it. You've no idea, sir, the\n      amount of little things that these chambers uses up,\" said Mr. Beeton.",
                "Fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out: \"It's hard on you, sir,\n      I do think it's hard on you. Ain't you going to do anything, sir?\"",

                "\"I wasn't doubting for a moment that you couldn't pay your way, sir; but I\n      'ave often said to my wife, 'It's 'ard on 'im because it isn't as if he\n      was an old man, nor yet a middle-aged one, but quite a young gentleman.\n      That's where it comes so 'ard.'\"",
                "\"I suppose so,\" said Dick, absently. This particular nerve through long\n      battering had ceased to feel -- much.",
                "\"I was thinking,\" continued Mr. Beeton, still making as if to go, \"that\n      you might like to hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an\n      evening. He do read beautiful, seeing he's only nine.\"",
                "\"I should be very grateful,\" said Dick. \"Only let me make it worth his\n      while.\"",

                "\"I'll hear him sing that too. Let him come this evening with the\n      newspapers.\"",
                "Alf was not a nice child, being puffed up with many school-board\n      certificates for good conduct, and inordinately proud of his singing. Mr.\n      Beeton remained, beaming, while the child wailed his way through a song of\n      some eight eight-line verses in the usual whine of a young Cockney, and,\n      after compliments, left him to read Dick the foreign telegrams. Ten\n      minutes later Alf returned to his parents rather pale and scared.",
                "\"'E said 'e couldn't stand it no more,\" he explained.",
                "\"He never said you read badly, Alf?\" Mrs. Beeton spoke.",

                "\"That's good hearing, but I do think for all the half-crown -- put it\n      into the kicking-donkey money-box, Alf, and let me see you do it -- he\n      might have kept you longer. Why, he couldn't have begun to understand how\n      beautiful you read.\"",
                "\"He's best left to hisself -- gentlemen always are when they're\n      downhearted,\" said Mr. Beeton.",
                "Alf's rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhow's special\n      correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear,\n      through the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind\n      the soldiers outside Suakin; could hear the men swearing and chaffing\n      across the cooking pots, and could smell the acrid wood-smoke as it\n      drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.",
                "That night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him,\n      offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he had\n      not shot himself long ago. That prayer was not answered, and indeed Dick\n      knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour and no\n      special virtue had kept him alive. Suicide, he had persuaded himself,\n      would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as well as a\n      weak-kneed confession of fear.",
                "\"Just for the fun of the thing,\" he said to the cat, who had taken\n      Binkie's place in his establishment, \"I should like to know how long this\n      is going to last. I can live for a year on the hundred pounds Torp cashed\n      for me. I must have two or three thousand at least in the Bank -- twenty\n      or thirty years more provided for, that is to say. Then I fall back on my\n      hundred and twenty a year, which will be more by that time. Let's\n      consider.",

Bah!\n      How these Christians funk death! Sixty-five -- we're only getting on in\n      years. Seventy-five is just possible, though. Great hell, cat O! fifty\n      years more of solitary confinement in the dark!

                "The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not\n      over-steady. It was within the limits of human possibility that -- that\n      was no letter from Maisie.

                "\"I don't know. I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin' at\n      everything when you're young.\"",
                "\"I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and\n      it has bounced up and hit me. God help it, whatever it is -- unless it\n      was all a joke. But I don't know any one who'd take the trouble to play a\n      joke on me -- Love and loyalty for nothing. It sounds tempting enough.\n      I wonder whether I have lost anything really?\"",
                "Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had\n      put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman's hands.",
                "Still, the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think\n      about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night. When\n      his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more, body and soul\n      together seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness.",
                "Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light\n      again. But there was no light to be reached. When that agony had left him\n      sweating and breathless, the downward flight would recommence till the\n      gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the\n      first. Followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw.\n      Then the procession of events would repeat itself till he was utterly worn\n      out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration of Maisie and\n      might-have-beens.",
                "At the end of everything Mr. Beeton came to his room and volunteered to\n      take him out. \"Not marketing this time, but we'll go into the Parks if you\n      like.\"",
                "\"Be damned if I do,\" quoth Dick. \"Keep to the streets and walk up and\n      down. I like to hear the people round me.\"",
                "This was not altogether true. The blind in the first stages of their\n      infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted arms -- but\n      Dick had no earthly desire to go to the Parks. Once and only once since\n      Maisie had shut her door he had gone there under Alf's charge. Alf forgot\n      him and fished for minnows in the Serpentine with some companions. After\n      half an hour's waiting Dick, almost weeping with rage and wrath, caught a\n      passer-by, who introduced him to a friendly policeman, who led him to a\n      four-wheeler opposite the Albert Hall. He never told Mr. Beeton of Alf's\n      forgetfulness, but... this was not the manner in which he was used to walk\n      the Parks aforetime.",
                "\"What streets would you like to walk down, then?\" said Mr. Beeton,\n      sympathetically. His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on\n      the grass of Green Park with his family, and half a dozen paper bags full\n      of food.",
                "\"Keep to the river,\" said Dick, and they kept to the river, and the rush\n      of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck\n      thence on to the Waterloo Road, Mr. Beeton explaining the beauties of the\n      scenery as he went on.",
                "\"And walking on the other side of the pavement,\" said he, \"unless I'm much\n      mistaken, is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be drawed.\n      I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name, except paying\n      tenants, 'o course!\"",
                "\"Stop her,\" said Dick. \"It's Bessie Broke. Tell her I'd like to speak to\n      her again. Quick, man!\"",
                "Mr. Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested\n      Bessie then on her way northward. She recognised him as the man in\n      authority who used to glare at her when she passed up Dick's staircase,\n      and her first impulse was to run.",
                "\"Wasn't you Mr. Heldar's model?\" said Mr. Beeton, planting himself in\n      front of her. \"You was. He's on the other side of the road and he'd like\n      to see you.\"",
                "\"Why?\" said Bessie, faintly. She remembered -- indeed had never for\n      long forgotten -- an affair connected with a newly finished picture.",
                "\"Because he has asked me to do so, and because he's most particular\n      blind.\"",
                "\"Drunk?\"",
                "\"No. 'Orspital blind. He can't see. That's him over there.\"",
                "Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr. Beeton pointed\n      him out -- a stub-bearded, bowed creature wearing a dirty\n      magenta-coloured neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat. There was nothing to\n      fear from such an one. Even if he chased her, Bessie thought, he could not\n      follow far. She crossed over, and Dick's face lighted up. It was long\n      since a woman of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him.",
                "\"I hope you're well, Mr. Heldar?\" said Bessie, a little puzzled. Mr.\n      Beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly.",
                "\"I'm very well indeed, and, by Jove! I'm glad to see -- hear you, I\n      mean, Bess. You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again\n      after you got your money. I don't know why you should. Are you going\n      anywhere in particular just now?\"",
                "\"I was going for a walk,\" said Bessie.",
                "\"Not the old business?\" Dick spoke under his breath.",
                "\"Lor, no! I paid my premium\" -- Bessie was very proud of that word -- \"for\n      a barmaid, sleeping in, and I'm at the bar now quite respectable. Indeed I\n      am.\"",
                "Mr. Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human\n      nature. Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his\n      gas-plugs without a word of apology. Bessie watched the flight with a\n      certain uneasiness; but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the\n      harm that had been done to him...",
                "\"It's hard work pulling the beer-handles,\" she went on, \"and they've got\n      one of them penny-in-the-slot cash-machines, so if you get wrong by a\n      penny at the end of the day -- but then I don't believe the machinery\n      is right. Do you?\"",
                "\"I've only seen it work. Mr. Beeton.\"",
                "\"He's gone.",
                "\"I'm afraid I must ask you to help me home, then. I'll make it worth your\n      while. You see.\" The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie saw.",
                "\"It isn't taking you out of your way?\" he said hesitatingly. \"I can ask a\n      policeman if it is.\"",
                "\"Not at all. I come on at seven and I'm off at four. That's easy hours.\"",
                "\"Good God! -- but I'm on all the time. I wish I had some work to do\n      too. Let's go home, Bess.\"",
                "He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk, recoiling with an oath.\n      Bessie took his arm and said nothing -- as she had said nothing when he\n      had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light. They walked\n      for some time in silence, the girl steering him deftly through the crowd.",
                "\"And where's -- where's Mr. Torpenhow?\" she inquired at last.",
                "\"He has gone away to the desert.\"",
                "\"Where's that?\"",
                "Dick pointed to the right. \"East -- out of the mouth of the river,\"\n       said he.",
                "\"Then west, then south, and then east again, all along the under-side of\n      Europe. Then south again, God knows how far.\" The explanation did not\n      enlighten Bessie in the least, but she held her tongue and looked to\n      Dick's patch till they came to the chambers.",
                "\"We'll have tea and muffins,\" he said joyously. \"I can't tell you, Bessie,\n      how glad I am to find you again. What made you go away so suddenly?\"",
                "\"I didn't think you'd want me any more,\" she said, emboldened by his\n      ignorance.",
                "\"I didn't, as a matter of fact -- but afterwards -- At any rate I'm\n      glad you've come. You know the stairs.\"",
                "So Bessie led him home to his own place -- there was no one to hinder -- and\n      shut the door of the studio.",
                "\"What a mess!\" was her first word. \"All these things haven't been looked\n      after for months and months.\"",
                "\"No, only weeks, Bess. You can't expect them to care.\"",
                "\"I don't know what you expect them to do. They ought to know what you've\n      paid them for. The dust's just awful. It's all over the easel.\"",
                "\"I don't use it much now.\"",
                "\"All over the pictures and the floor, and all over your coat. I'd like to\n      speak to them housemaids.\"",
                "\"Ring for tea, then.\" Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by\n      custom.",
                "Bessie saw the action and, as far as in her lay, was touched. But there\n      remained always a keen sense of new-found superiority, and it was in her\n      voice when she spoke.",
                "\"How long have you been like this?\" she said wrathfully, as though the\n      blindness were some fault of the housemaids.",
                "\"How?\"",
                "\"As you are.\"",
                "\"The day after you went away with the check, almost as soon as my picture\n      was finished; I hardly saw her alive.\"",
                "\"Then they've been cheating you ever since, that's all. I know their nice\n      little ways.\"",
                "A woman may love one man and despise another, but on general feminine\n      principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being\n      defrauded. Her loved one can look to himself, but the other man, being\n      obviously an idiot, needs protection.",
                "\"I don't think Mr. Beeton cheats much,\" said Dick. Bessie was flouncing up\n      and down the room, and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment as he\n      heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between.",
                "\"Tea and muffins,\" she said shortly, when the ring at the bell was\n      answered; \"two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot. I don't want the old\n      teapot that was here when I used to come. It don't draw. Get another.\"",
                "The housemaid went away scandalised, and Dick chuckled. Then he began to\n      cough as Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust.",
                "\"What are you trying to do?\"",
                "\"Put things straight. This is like unfurnished lodgings. How could you let\n      it go so?\"",
                "\"How could I help it? Dust away.\"",
                "She dusted furiously, and in the midst of all the pother entered Mrs.\n      Beeton. Her husband on his return had explained the situation, winding up\n      with the peculiarly felicitous proverb, \"Do unto others as you would be\n      done by.\" She had descended to put into her place the person who demanded\n      muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to both.",
                "\"Muffins ready yet?\" said Bess, still dusting. She was no longer a drab of\n      the streets but a young lady who, thanks to Dick's check, had paid her\n      premium and was entitled to pull beer-handles with the best. Being neatly\n      dressed in black she did not hesitate to face Mrs. Beeton, and there\n      passed between the two women certain regards that Dick would have\n      appreciated. The situation adjusted itself by eye. Bessie had won, and\n      Mrs. Beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about\n      models, hussies, trollops, and the like, to her husband.",
                "\"There's nothing to be got of interfering with him, Liza,\" he said. \"Alf,\n      you go along into the street to play. When he isn't crossed he's as kindly\n      as kind, but when he's crossed he's the devil and all. We took too many\n      little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular\n      about what he does. They ain't no objects to a blind man, of course, but\n      if it was to come into court we'd get the sack. Yes, I did introduce him\n      to that girl because I'm a feelin' man myself.\"",
                "\"Much too feelin'!\" Mrs. Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish, and\n      thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion.",
                "\"I ain't ashamed of it, and it isn't for us to judge him hard so long as\n      he pays quiet and regular as he do. I know how to manage young gentlemen,\n      you know how to cook for them, and what I says is, let each stick to his\n      own business and then there won't be any trouble. Take them muffins down,\n      Liza, and be sure you have no words with that young woman. His lot is\n      cruel hard, and if he's crossed he do swear worse than any one I've ever\n      served.\"",
                "\"That's a little better,\" said Bessie, sitting down to the tea. \"You\n      needn't wait, thank you, Mrs. Beeton.\"",
                "\"I had no intention of doing such, I do assure you.\"",
                "Bessie made no answer whatever. This, she knew, was the way in which real\n      ladies routed their foes, and when one is a barmaid at a first-class\n      public-house one may become a real lady at ten minutes' notice.",
                "Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and\n      displeased. There were droppings of food all down the front of his coat;\n      the mouth under the ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the forehead\n      was lined and contracted; and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty\n      indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called gray. The\n      utter misery and self-abandonment of the man appealed to her, and at the\n      bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought\n      low who had once humbled her.",
                "\"Oh! it is good to hear you moving about,\" said Dick, rubbing his hands.\n      \"Tell us all about your bar successes, Bessie, and the way you live now.\"",
                "\"Never mind that. I'm quite respectable, as you'd see by looking at me.\n      You don't seem to live too well. What made you go blind that sudden? Why\n      isn't there any one to look after you?\"",
                "Dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of it.",
                "\"I was cut across the head a long time ago, and that ruined my eyes. I\n      don't suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more. Why\n      should they? -- and Mr. Beeton really does everything I want.\"",
                "\"Don't you know any gentlemen and ladies, then, while you was -- well?\"",
                "\"A few, but I don't care to have them looking at me.\"",
                "\"I suppose that's why you've growed a beard. Take it off, it don't become\n      you.\"",
                "\"Good gracious, child, do you imagine that I think of what becomes of me\n      these days?\"",
                "\"You ought. Get that taken off before I come here again. I suppose I can\n      come, can't I?\"",
                "\"I'd be only too grateful if you did. I don't think I treated you very\n      well in the old days. I used to make you angry.\"",
                "\"Very angry, you did.\"",
                "\"I'm sorry for it, then. Come and see me when you can and as often as you\n      can. God knows, there isn't a soul in the world to take that trouble\n      except you and Mr. Beeton.\"",
                "\"A lot of trouble he's taking and she too.\" This with a toss of the head.",
                "\"They've let you do anyhow and they haven't done anything for you. I've\n      only to look and see that much. I'll come, and I'll be glad to come, but\n      you must go and be shaved, and you must get some other clothes -- those\n      ones aren't fit to be seen.\"",
                "\"I have heaps somewhere,\" he said helplessly.",
                "\"I know you have. Tell Mr. Beeton to give you a new suit and I'll brush it\n      and keep it clean. You may be as blind as a barn-door, Mr. Heldar, but it\n      doesn't excuse you looking like a sweep.\"",
                "\"Do I look like a sweep, then?\"",
                "\"Oh, I'm sorry for you. I'm that sorry for you!\" she cried impulsively,\n      and took Dick's hands. Mechanically, he lowered his head as if to kiss -- she\n      was the only woman who had taken pity on him, and he was not too proud for\n      a little pity now. She stood up to go.",
                "\"Nothing 'o that kind till you look more like a gentleman. It's quite easy\n      when you get shaved, and some clothes.\"",
                "He could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say good-bye. She\n      passed behind him, kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck, and ran\n      away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the Melancolia.",
                "\"To think of me kissing Mr. Heldar,\" she said to herself, \"after all he's\n      done to me and all! Well, I'm sorry for him, and if he was shaved he\n      wouldn't be so bad to look at, but... Oh them Beetons, how shameful\n      they've treated him! I know Beeton's wearing his shirt on his back today\n      just as well as if I'd aired it. Tomorrow, I'll see... I wonder if he has\n      much of his own. It might be worth more than the bar -- I wouldn't have\n      to do any work -- and just as respectable as if no one knew.\"",
                "Dick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift. He was acutely\n      conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night, but it\n      seemed, among very many other things, to enforce the wisdom of getting\n      shaved.",
                "He was shaved accordingly in the morning, and felt the better for it. A\n      fresh suit of clothes, white linen, and the knowledge that some one in the\n      world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made him\n      carry himself almost upright; for the brain was relieved for a while from\n      thinking of Maisie, who, under other circumstances, might have given that\n      kiss and a million others.",
                "\"Let us consider,\" said he, after lunch. \"The girl can't care, and it's a\n      toss-up whether she comes again or not, but if money can buy her to look\n      after me she shall be bought. Nobody else in the world would take the\n      trouble, and I can make it worth her while. She's a child of the gutter\n      holding brevet rank as a barmaid; so she shall have everything she wants\n      if she'll only come and talk and look after me.\" He rubbed his newly shorn\n      chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of her not coming. \"I\n      suppose I did look rather a sweep,\" he went on. \"I had no reason to look\n      otherwise. I knew things dropped on my clothes, but it didn't matter. It\n      would be cruel if she didn't come. She must. Maisie came once, and that\n      was enough for her. She was quite right. She had something to work for.\n      This creature has only beer-handles to pull, unless she has deluded some\n      young man into keeping company with her.

                "Something cried aloud within him: -- This will hurt more than anything\n      that has gone before. It will recall and remind and suggest and tantalise,\n      and in the end drive you mad.",

                "\"You'd better come and housekeep for me then, Bessie.\"",
                "\"Couldn't do it in these chambers -- you know that as well as I do.\"",

                "Then came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain. If his arm were\n      thus round Maisie's waist and a kiss had just been given and taken between\n      them, -- why then... He pressed the girl more closely to himself\n      because the pain whipped him. She was wondering how to explain a little\n      accident to the Melancolia. At any rate, if this man really desired the\n      solace of her company -- and certainly he would relapse into his\n      original slough if she withdrew it -- he would not be more than just a\n      little vexed.",
                "It would be delightful at least to see what would happen, and by her\n      teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his companion.",

                "\"I shouldn't worrit about that picture if I was you,\" she began, in the\n      hope of turning his attention.",
                "\"It's at the back of all my canvases somewhere. Find it, Bess; you know it\n      as well as I do.\"",
                "\"I know -- but -- \"",
                "\"But what? You've wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer. Women\n      haggle much better than men. It might be a matter of eight or nine hundred\n      pounds to -- to us. I simply didn't like to think about it for a long\n      time. It was mixed up with my life so. -- But we'll cover up our tracks\n      and get rid of everything, eh?

                "Then she began to repent very much indeed, because she knew the value of\n      money. Still, it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the\n      value of his work. Gentlemen, she knew, were absurdly particular about\n      their things. She giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries to\n      explain the breakage of a pipe.",

                "He was beginning to learn, not for the first time in his experience, that\n      kissing is a cumulative poison. The more you get of it, the more you want.",
                "Bessie gave the kiss promptly, whispering, as she did so, \"I was so angry\n      I rubbed out that picture with the turpentine. You aren't angry, are you?\"",
                "\"What? Say that again.\" The man's hand had closed on her wrist.",
                "\"I rubbed it out with turps and the knife,\" faltered Bessie. \"I thought\n      you'd only have to do it over again. You did do it over again, didn't you?\n      Oh, let go of my wrist; you're hurting me.\"",

                "He did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the carpet.",
                "Then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the\n      stock-whip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles\n      that he would escape. For weeks he had forced himself not to think of the\n      Melancolia, because she was a part of his dead life. With Bessie's return\n      and certain new prospects that had developed themselves, the Melancolia -- lovelier\n      in his imagination than she had ever been on canvas -- reappeared. By\n      her aid he might have procured more money wherewith to amuse Bess and to\n      forget Maisie, as well as another taste of an almost forgotten success.\n      Now, thanks to a vicious little housemaid's folly, there was nothing to\n      look for -- not even the hope that he might some day take an abiding\n      interest in the housemaid. Worst of all, he had been made to appear\n      ridiculous in Maisie's eyes. A woman will forgive the man who has ruined\n      her life's work so long as he gives her love; a man may forgive those who\n      ruin the love of his life, but he will never forgive the destruction of\n      his work.",
                "\"Tck -- tck -- tck,\" said Dick between his teeth, and then laughed\n      softly. \"It's an omen, Bessie, and -- a good many things considered, it\n      serves me right for doing what I have done. By Jove! that accounts for\n      Maisie's running away. She must have thought me perfectly mad -- small\n      blame to her! The whole picture ruined, isn't it so? What made you do it?\"",
                "\"Because I was that angry. I'm not angry now -- I'm awful sorry.\"",
                "\"I wonder. -- It doesn't matter, anyhow. I'm to blame for making the\n      mistake.\"",
                "\"What mistake?\"",
                "\"Something you wouldn't understand, dear. Great heavens! to think that a\n      little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride!\" Dick was\n      talking to himself as Bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist.",
                "\"I ain't a piece of dirt, and you shouldn't call me so! I did it 'cause I\n      hated you, and I'm only sorry now 'cause you're 'cause you're --  -- \"",
                "\"Exactly -- because I'm blind. There's noting like tact in little\n      things.\"",
                "Bessie began to sob. She did not like being shackled against her will; she\n      was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it, and was sorry too that\n      her great revenge had only made Dick laugh.",
                "\"Don't cry,\" he said, and took her into his arms. \"You only did what you\n      thought right.\"",
                "\"I -- I ain't a little piece of dirt, and if you say that I'll never\n      come to you again.\"",

                "Bessie remained in his arms shrinking. Dick's first thought was connected\n      with Maisie, and it hurt him as white-hot iron hurts an open sore.",
                "Not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman.",
                "The first pang -- the first sense of things lost is but the prelude to\n      the play, for the very just Providence who delights in causing pain has\n      decreed that the agony shall return, and that in the midst of keenest\n      pleasure.",
                "They know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by the love\n      of their life, and in their new wives' arms are compelled to realise it.",
                "It is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone, so\n      long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work. When that\n      resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone.",
                "These things and some others Dick considered while he was holding Bessie\n      to his heart.",
                "\"Though you mayn't know it,\" he said, raising his head, \"the Lord is a\n      just and a terrible God, Bess; with a very strong sense of humour. It\n      serves me right -- how it serves me right! Torp could understand it if\n      he were here; he must have suffered something at your hands, child, but\n      only for a minute or so. I saved him. Set that to my credit, some one.\"",
                "\"Let me go,\" said Bess, her face darkening. \"Let me go.\"",
                "\"All in good time. Did you ever attend Sunday school?\"",

                "\"Indeed, I'm not. I'm making fun of myself.... Thus. 'He saved others,\n      himself he cannot save.'

                "\"I'm sorry; I'm awful sorry about the picture.\"",
                "\"I'm not. I'm grateful to you for spoiling it.... What were we talking\n      about before you mentioned the thing?\"",

                "Bessie cursed under her breath. She had pitied the man sincerely, had\n      kissed him with almost equal sincerity, for he was not unhandsome; it\n      pleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector, and above all\n      there were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one. Now through a\n      slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little, not too\n      much, pain she had lost the money, the blessed idleness and the pretty\n      things, the companionship, and the chance of looking outwardly as\n      respectable as a real lady.",
                "\"Now fill me a pipe. Tobacco doesn't taste, but it doesn't matter, and\n      I'll think things out. What's the day of the week, Bess?\"",

It wasn't your fault, child; it was mine\n      altogether. Oh, you funny little opossum, mop your eyes and take me out! I\n      want the pass-book and the check-book. Stop a minute. Four thousand pounds\n      at four per cent -- that's safe interest -- means a hundred and\n      sixty pounds a year; one hundred and twenty pounds a year -- also safe -- is\n      two eighty, and two hundred and eighty pounds added to three hundred a\n      year means gilded luxury for a single woman.

                "Richer by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his money-belt, Dick caused\n      Bessie, now thoroughly bewildered, to hurry from the bank to the P. and O.\n      offices, where he explained things tersely.",

                "Long ago Dick had carefully possessed himself of a forty-pound weight\n      field-equipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience. It was\n      this put-away treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle.

                "It is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see, and Dick had\n      particular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear. So he began,\n      following his right hand with his left: \"The badness of this writing is\n      because I am blind and cannot see my pen.\" H'mph! -- even a lawyer\n      can't mistake that. It must be signed, I suppose, but it needn't be\n      witnessed. Now an inch lower -- why did I never learn to use a\n      type-writer? -- \"This is the last will and testament of me, Richard\n      Heldar. I am in sound bodily and mental health, and there is no previous\n      will to revoke.\" -- That's all right. Damn the pen! Whereabouts on the\n      paper was I? -- \" \"I leave everything that I possess in the world,\n      including four thousand pounds, and two thousand seven hundred and twenty\n      eight pounds held for me -- oh, I can't get this straight.\" He tore off\n      half the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting.\n      Then: \"I leave all the money I possess in the world to\" -- here\n      followed Maisie's name, and the names of the two banks that held the\n      money.",
                "\"It mayn't be quite regular, but no one has a shadow of a right to dispute\n      it, and I've given Maisie's address. Come in, Mr. Beeton.

Tomorrow you\n      must take me to the landlord and I'll pay forfeit for leaving without\n      notice, and I'll lodge this paper with him in case anything happens while\n      I'm away. Now we're going to light up the studio stove. Stay with me, and\n      give me my papers as I want 'em.\"",
                "No one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a year's accumulation of\n      bills, letters, and dockets can make. Dick stuffed into the stove every\n      document in the studio -- saving only three unopened letters; destroyed\n      sketch-books, rough note-books, new and half-finished canvases alike.",
                "\"What a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough in\n      one place, to be sure,\" said Mr. Beeton, at last.",

                "\"Yes, sir,\" politely. Mr. Beeton was quite sure that Dick had gone mad,\n      otherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a\n      song. The canvas things took up storage room and were much better out of\n      the way.",
                "There remained only to leave the little will in safe hands: that could not\n      be accomplished til tomorrow. Dick groped about the floor picking up the\n      last pieces of paper, assured himself again and again that there remained\n      no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk, and sat down\n      before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting iron cracked\n      in the silence of the night."

                "\"Goodbye, Bess; I promised you fifty. Here's a hundred -- all that I\n      got for my furniture from Beeton. That will keep you in pretty frocks for\n      some time. You've been a good little girl, all things considered, but\n      you've given me and Torpenhow a fair amount of trouble.\"",
                "\"Give Mr. Torpenhow my love if you see him, won't you?\"",
                "\"Of course I will, dear. Now take me up the gang-plank and into the cabin.\n      Once aboard the lugger and the maid is -- and I am free, I mean.\"",
                "\"Who'll look after you on this ship?\"",
                "\"The head-steward, if there's any use in money. The doctor when we come to\n      Port Said, if I know anything of P. and O. doctors. After that, the Lord\n      will provide, as He used to do.\"",
                "Bess found Dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of\n      leavetakers and weeping relatives. Then he kissed her, and laid himself\n      down in his bunk until the decks should be clear. He who had taken so long\n      to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography of a\n      ship, and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine to him.",
                "Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been\n      introduced to the head-steward, had royally tipped him, secured a good\n      place at table, opened out his baggage, and settled himself down with joy\n      in the cabin. It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about,\n      for he knew everything so well. Then God was very kind: a deep sleep of\n      weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of Maisie, and he\n      slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the Thames and was lifting\n      to the pulse of the Channel.",
                "The rattle of the engines, the reek of oil and paint, and a very familiar\n      sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance.",
                "\"Oh, it's good to be alive again!\" He yawned, stretched himself\n      vigorously, and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of\n      the lights of Brighton. This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square\n      is a common; the free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less Dick could\n      feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already. A boisterous little\n      cross-swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose; and one wave\n      breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new\n      deck-chairs. He heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass, was\n      stung in the face by a cupful, and sniffing luxuriously, felt his way to\n      the smoking-room by the wheel. There a strong breeze found him, blew his\n      cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway, and the smoking-room\n      steward, understanding that he was a voyager of experience, said that the\n      weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than half a\n      gale in the Bay. These things fell as they were foretold, and Dick enjoyed\n      himself to the utmost. It is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay\n      firm hold upon tables, stanchions, and ropes in moving from place to\n      place. On land the man who feels with his hands is patently blind. At sea\n      even a blind man who is not sea-sick can jest with the doctor over the\n      weakness of his fellows. Dick told the doctor many tales -- and these\n      are coin of more value than silver if properly handled -- smoked with\n      him till unholy hours of the night, and so won his short-lived regard that\n      he promised Dick a few hours of his time when they came to Port Said.",
                "And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew, and the engines sang\n      their song day and night, and the sun grew stronger day by day, and Tom\n      the Lascar barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened hatch-grating\n      where the cool winds blew, and the awnings were spread and the passengers\n      made merry, and at last they came to Port Said.",
                "\"Take me,\" said Dick, to the doctor, \"to Madame Binat's -- if you know\n      where that is.\"",
                "\"Whew!\" said the doctor, \"I do. There's not much to choose between 'em;\n      but I suppose you're aware that that's one of the worst houses in the\n      place. They'll rob you to begin with, and knife you later.\"",
                "\"Not they. Take me there, and I can look after myself.\"",
                "So he was brought to Madame Binat's and filled his nostrils with the\n      well-remembered smell of the East, that runs without a change from the\n      Canal head to Hong-Kong, and his mouth with the villainous Lingua Franca\n      of the Levant. The heat smote him between the shoulder-blades with the\n      buffet of an old friend, his feet slipped on the sand, and his coat-sleeve\n      was warm as new-baked bread when he lifted it to his nose.",
                "Madame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick\n      entered the drinking-shop which was one source of her gains. But for a\n      little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he had\n      ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears. Somebody opened a\n      bottle of peculiarly strong Schiedam. The smell reminded Dick of Monsieur\n      Binat, who, by the way, had spoken of art and degradation.",
                "Binat was dead; Madame said as much when the doctor departed, scandalised,\n      so far as a ship's doctor can be, at the warmth of Dick's reception. Dick\n      was delighted at it. \"They remember me here after a year. They have\n      forgotten me across the water by this time. Madame, I want a long talk\n      with you when you're at liberty. It is good to be back again.\"",
                "In the evening she set an iron-topped cafe-table out on the sands, and\n      Dick and she sat by it, while the house behind them filled with riot,\n      merriment, oaths, and threats. The stars came out and the lights of the\n      shipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the Canal.",
                "\"Yes. The war is good for trade, my friend; but what dost thou do here? We\n      have not forgotten thee.\"",
                "\"I was over there in England and I went blind.\"",
                "\"But there was the glory first. We heard of it here, even here -- I and\n      Binat; and thou hast used the head of Yellow 'Tina -- she is still\n      alive -- so often and so well that 'Tina laughed when the papers\n      arrived by the mail-boats. It was always something that we here could\n      recognise in the paintings. And then there was always the glory and the\n      money for thee.\"",
                "\"I am not poor -- I shall pay you well.\"",
                "\"Not to me. Thou hast paid for everything.\" Under her breath, \"Mon Dieu,\n      to be blind and so young! What horror!\"",
                "Dick could not see her face with the pity on it, or his own with the\n      discoloured hair at the temples. He did not feel the need of pity; he was\n      too anxious to get to the front once more, and explained his desire.",
                "\"And where? The Canal is full of the English ships. Sometimes they fire as\n      they used to do when the war was here -- ten years ago. Beyond Cairo\n      there is fighting, but how canst thou go there without a correspondent's\n      passport? And in the desert there is always fighting, but that is\n      impossible also,\" said she.",
                "\"I must go to Suakin.\" He knew, thanks to Alf's readings, that Torpenhow\n      was at work with the column that was protecting the construction of the\n      Suakin-Berber line. P. and O. steamers do not touch at that port, and,\n      besides, Madame Binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth\n      anything. They were not respectable folk, but they could cause things to\n      be accomplished, which is much more important when there is work toward.",
                "\"But at Suakin they are always fighting. That desert breeds men always -- and\n      always more men. And they are so bold! Why to Suakin?\"",
                "\"My friend is there.",
                "\"Thy friend! Chtt! Thy friend is death, then.\"",
                "Madame Binat dropped a fat arm on the table-top, filled Dick's glass anew,\n      and looked at him closely under the stars. There was no need that he\n      should bow his head in assent and say -- \"No. He is a man, but -- if\n      it should arrive... blamest thou?\"",
                "\"I blame?\" she laughed shrilly. \"Who am I that I should blame any one -- except\n      those who try to cheat me over their consommations. But it is very\n      terrible.\"",
                "\"I must go to Suakin. Think for me. A great deal has changed within the\n      year, and the men I knew are not here. The Egyptian lighthouse steamer\n      goes down the Canal to Suakin -- and the post-boats -- But even then --  -- \"",
                "\"Do not think any longer. I know, and it is for me to think. Thou shalt go -- thou\n      shalt go and see thy friend. Be wise. Sit here until the house is a little\n      quiet -- I must attend to my guests -- and afterwards go to bed.\n      Thou shalt go, in truth, thou shalt go.\"",
                "\"Tomorrow?\"",
                "\"As soon as may be.\" She was talking as though he were a child.",
                "He sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the\n      streets, and wondering how soon the end would come, till Madame Binat\n      carried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep. The house shouted and\n      sang and danced and revelled, Madame Binat moving through it with one eye\n      on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on Dick's interests. To\n      this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive Turkish officers of\n      fellaheen regiments, and was more than kind to camel agents of no\n      nationality whatever.",
                "In the early morning, being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red\n      silk ball-dress, with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a necklace\n      of plate-glass diamonds, she made chocolate and carried it in to Dick.",
                "\"It is only I, and I am of discreet age, eh? Drink and eat the roll too.\n      Thus in France mothers bring their sons, when those behave wisely, the\n      morning chocolate.\" She sat down on the side of the bed whispering: -- \"It\n      is all arranged. Thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat. That is a bribe of\n      ten pounds English. The captain is never paid by the Government. The boat\n      comes to Suakin in four days. There will go with thee George, a Greek\n      muleteer. Another bribe of ten pounds. I will pay; they must not know of\n      thy money. George will go with thee as far as he goes with his mules. Then\n      he comes back to me, for his well-beloved is here, and if I do not receive\n      a telegram from Suakin saying that thou art well, the girl answers for\n      George.\"",
                "\"Thank you.\" He reached out sleepily for the cup. \"You are much too kind,\n      Madame.\"",
                "\"If there were anything that I might do I would say, stay here and be\n      wise; but I do not think that would be best for thee.\" She looked at her\n      liquor-stained dress with a sad smile. \"Nay, thou shalt go, in truth, thou\n      shalt go. It is best so. My boy, it is best so.\"",
                "She stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes. \"That is for good-morning,\"\n       she said, going away. \"When thou art dressed we will speak to George and\n      make everything ready. But first we must open the little trunk. Give me\n      the keys.\"",
                "\"The amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous. I shall expect\n      Torp to kiss me next. He is more likely to swear at me for getting in his\n      way, though. Well, it won't last long. -- Ohe, Madame, help me to my\n      toilette of the guillotine! There will be no chance of dressing properly\n      out yonder.\"",
                "He was rummaging among his new campaign-kit, and rowelling his hands with\n      the spurs. There are two ways of wearing well-oiled ankle-jacks, spotless\n      blue bands, khaki coat and breeches, and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet.\n      The right way is the way of the untired man, master of himself, setting\n      out upon an expedition, well pleased.",
                "\"Everything must be very correct,\" Dick explained. \"It will become dirty\n      afterwards, but now it is good to feel well dressed. Is everything as it\n      should be?\"",
                "He patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on\n      the right hip and fingered his collar.",
                "\"I can do no more,\" Madame said, between laughing and crying. \"Look at\n      thyself -- but I forgot.\"",
                "\"I am very content.\" He stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings.",
                "\"Now let us go and see the captain and George and the lighthouse boat. Be\n      quick, Madame.\"",
                "\"But thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the\n      daylight. Figure to yourself if some English ladies --  -- \"",
                "\"There are no English ladies; and if there are, I have forgotten them.\n      Take me there.\"",
                "In spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the\n      lighthouse boat began to move. Madame had said a great deal both to George\n      and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made for Dick's\n      benefit. Very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to\n      disregard Madame's advice. That sort of contempt might end in being knifed\n      by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation.",
                "For six days -- two of them were wasted in the crowded Canal -- the\n      little steamer worked her way to Suakin, where she was to pick up the\n      superintendent of the lighthouse; and Dick made it his business to\n      propitiate George, who was distracted with fears for the safety of his\n      light-of-love and half inclined to make Dick responsible for his own\n      discomfort. When they arrived George took him under his wing, and together\n      they entered the red-hot seaport, encumbered with the material and wastage\n      of the Suakin-Berger line, from locomotives in disconsolate fragments to\n      mounds of chairs and pot-sleepers.",
                "\"If you keep with me,\" said George, \"nobody will ask for passports or what\n      you do. They are all very busy.\"",
                "\"Yes; but I should like to hear some of the Englishmen talk. They might\n      remember me. I was known here a long time ago -- when I was some one\n      indeed.\"",
                "\"A long time ago is a very long time ago here. The graveyards are full.\n      Now listen. This new railway runs out so far as Tanai-el-Hassan -- that\n      is seven miles. Then there is a camp. They say that beyond Tanai-el-Hassan\n      the English troops go forward, and everything that they require will be\n      brought to them by this line.\"",
                "\"Ah! Base camp. I see. That's a better business than fighting Fuzzies in\n      the open.\"",
                "\"For this reason even the mules go up in the iron-train.\"",
                "\"Iron what?\"",
                "\"It is all covered with iron, because it is still being shot at.\"",
                "\"An armoured train. Better and better! Go on, faithful George.\"",
                "\"And I go up with my mules tonight. Only those who particularly require to\n      go to the camp go out with the train. They begin to shoot not far from the\n      city.\"",
                "\"The dears -- they always used to!\" Dick snuffed the smell of parched\n      dust, heated iron, and flaking paint with delight. Certainly the old life\n      was welcoming him back most generously.",
                "\"When I have got my mules together I go up tonight, but you must first\n      send a telegram of Port Said, declaring that I have done you no harm.\"",
                "\"Madame has you well in hand. Would you stick a knife into me if you had\n      the chance?\"",
                "\"I have no chance,\" said the Greek. \"She is there with that woman.\"",
                "\"I see. It's a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the\n      chance of loot. I sympathise with you, George.\"",
                "They went to the telegraph-office unquestioned, for all the world was\n      desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head, and Suakin was\n      the last place under sky that would be chosen for holiday-ground. On their\n      return the voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was doing. The\n      blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on George's\n      elbow as he replied -- \"Egyptian Government -- mules. My orders are\n      to give them over to the A. C. G. at Tanai-el-Hassan. Any occasion to show\n      my papers?\"",
                "\"Oh, certainly not. I beg your pardon. I'd no right to ask, but not seeing\n      your face before I --  -- \"",
                "\"I go out in the train tonight, I suppose,\" said Dick, boldly. \"There will\n      be no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?\"",
                "\"You can see the horse-platforms from here. You must have them loaded up\n      early.\" The young man went away wondering what sort of broken-down waif\n      this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek\n      muleteers. Dick felt unhappy. To outface an English officer is no small\n      thing, but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark,\n      and stumbles up and down rough ways, thinking and eternally thinking of\n      what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise, and all had been\n      as it was not.",
                "George shared his meal with Dick and went off to the mule-lines. His\n      charge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands. Before his\n      tight-shut eyes danced the face of Maisie, laughing, with parted lips.\n      There was a great bustle and clamour about him. He grew afraid and almost\n      called for George.",
                "\"I say, have you got your mules ready?\" It was the voice of the subaltern\n      over his shoulder.",
                "\"My man's looking after them. The -- the fact is I've a touch of\n      ophthalmia and can't see very well.",
                "\"By Jove! that's bad. You ought to lie up in hospital for a while. I've\n      had a turn of it myself. It's as bad as being blind.\"",
                "\"So I find it. When does this armoured train go?\"",
                "\"At six o'clock. It takes an hour to cover the seven miles.\"",
                "\"Are the Fuzzies on the rampage -- eh?\"",
                "\"About three nights a week. Fact is I'm in acting command of the\n      night-train. It generally runs back empty to Tanai for the night.\"",
                "\"Big camp at Tanai, I suppose?\"",
                "\"Pretty big. It has to feed our desert-column somehow.\"",
                "\"Is that far off?\"",
                "\"Between thirty and forty miles -- in an infernal thirsty country.\"",
                "\"Is the country quiet between Tanai and our men?\"",
                "\"More or less. I shouldn't care to cross it alone, or with a subaltern's\n      command for the matter of that, but the scouts get through it in some\n      extraordinary fashion.\"",
                "\"They always did.\"",
                "\"Have you been here before, then?\"",
                "\"I was through most of the trouble when it first broke out.\"",
                "\"In the service and cashiered,\" was the subaltern's first thought, so he\n      refrained from putting any questions.",
                "\"There's your man coming up with the mules. It seems rather queer --  -- \"",
                "\"That I should be mule-leading?\" said Dick.",
                "\"I didn't mean to say so, but it is. Forgive me -- it's beastly\n      impertinence I know, but you speak like a man who has been at a public\n      school. There's no mistaking the tone.\"",
                "\"I am a public school man.\"",
                "\"I thought so. I say, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but you're a\n      little down on your luck, aren't you? I saw you sitting with your head in\n      your hands, and that's why I spoke.\"",
                "\"Thanks. I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be.\"",
                "\"Suppose -- I mean I'm a public school man myself. Couldn't I perhaps -- take\n      it as a loan y'know and --  -- \"",
                "\"You're much too good, but on my honour I've as much money as I want. ...\n      I tell you what you could do for me, though, and put me under an\n      everlasting obligation. Let me come into the bogie truck of the train.\n      There is a fore-truck, isn't there?\"",
                "\"Yes. How d'you know?\"",
                "\"I've been in an armoured train before. Only let me see -- hear some of\n      the fun I mean, and I'll be grateful. I go at my own risk as a\n      non-combatant.\"",
                "The young man thought for a minute. \"All right,\" he said. \"We're supposed\n      to be an empty train, and there's no one to blow me up at the other end.\"",
                "George and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the mules,\n      and the narrow-gauge armoured train, plated with three-eighths inch\n      boiler-plate till it looked like one long coffin, stood ready to start.",
                "Two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered in\n      with plating, except that the leading one was pierced in front for the\n      muzzle of a machine-gun, and the second at either side for lateral fire.",
                "The trucks together made one long iron-vaulted chamber in which a score of\n      artillerymen were rioting.",
                "\"Whitechapel -- last train! Ah, I see yer kissin' in the first class\n      there!\" somebody shouted, just as Dick was clamouring into the forward\n      truck.",

                "\"Thanks. I'll pay my footing,\" said Dick, and relations of the most\n      amiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the\n      subaltern, and the train jolted out over the rough track.",
                "\"This is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy in\n      the open,\" said Dick, from his place in the corner.",
                "\"Oh, but he's still unimpressed. There he goes!\" said the subaltern, as a\n      bullet struck the outside of the truck. \"We always have at least one\n      demonstration against the night-train. Generally they attack the\n      rear-truck, where my junior commands. He gets all the fun of the fair.\"",
                "\"Not tonight though! Listen!\" said Dick. A flight of heavy-handed bullets\n      was succeeded by yelling and shouts. The children of the desert valued\n      their nightly amusement, and the train was an excellent mark.",
                "\"Is it worth giving them half a hopper full?\" the subaltern asked of the\n      engine, which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers.",
                "\"I should think so! This is my section of the line. They'll be playing old\n      Harry with my permanent way if we don't stop 'em.\"",
                "\"Right O!\"",
                "\"Hrrmph!\" said the machine gun through all its five noses as the subaltern\n      drew the lever home. The empty cartridges clashed on the floor and the\n      smoke blew back through the truck. There was indiscriminate firing at the\n      rear of the train, and return fire from the darkness without and unlimited\n      howling. Dick stretched himself on the floor, wild with delight at the\n      sounds and the smells.",
                "\"God is very good -- I never thought I'd hear this again. Give 'em\n      hell, men. Oh, give 'em hell!\" he cried.",
                "The train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party went\n      out to reconnoitre, but came back, cursing, for spades. The children of\n      the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails, and twenty minutes were\n      lost in clearing it away. Then the slow progress recommenced, to be varied\n      with more shots, more shoutings, the steady clack and kick of the machine\n      guns, and a final difficulty with a half-lifted rail ere the train came\n      under the protection of the roaring camp at Tanai-el-Hassan.",
                "\"Now, you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through,\" said\n      the subaltern, unshipping the cartridge-hopper above his pet gun.",
                "\"It was a lark, though. I only wish it had lasted twice as long. How\n      superb it must have looked from outside!\" said Dick, sighing regretfully.",
                "\"It palls after the first few nights. By the way, when you've settled\n      about your mules, come and see what we can find to eat in my tent. I'm\n      Bennil of the Gunners -- in the artillery lines -- and mind you\n      don't fall over my tent-ropes in the dark.\"",
                "But it was all dark to Dick. He could only smell the camels, the\n      hay-bales, the cooking, the smoky fires, and the tanned canvas of the\n      tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, shouting for\n      George. There was a sound of light-hearted kicking on the iron skin of the\n      rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the mules.",
                "The engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dick's ear; a cold wind of the\n      desert danced between his legs; he was hungry, and felt tired and dirty -- so\n      dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands. That was a hopeless\n      job; he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count over the many\n      times that he had waited in strange or remote places for trains or camels,\n      mules or horses, to carry him to his business. In those days he could see -- few\n      men more clearly -- and the spectacle of an armed camp at dinner under\n      the stare was an ever fresh pleasure to the eye. There was colour, light,\n      and motion, without which no man has much pleasure in living. This night\n      there remained for him only one more journey through the darkness that\n      never lifts to tell a man how far he has travelled. Then he would grip\n      Torpenhow's hand again -- Torpenhow, who was alive and strong, and\n      lived in the midst of the action that had once made the reputation of a\n      man called Dick Heldar: not in the least to be confused with the blind,\n      bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to the same name. Yes, he would\n      find Torpenhow, and come as near to the old life as might be. Afterwards\n      he would forget everything: Bessie, who had wrecked the Melancolia and so\n      nearly wrecked his life; Beeton, who lived in a strange unreal city full\n      of tin-tacks and gas-plugs and matters that no men needed; that irrational\n      being who had offered him love and loyalty for nothing, but had not signed\n      her name; and most of all Maisie, who, from her own point of view, was\n      undeniably right in all she did, but oh, at this distance, so\n      tantalisingly fair.",
                "George's hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation.",
                "\"And what now?\" said George.",
                "\"Oh yes of course. What now? Take me to the camel-men. Take me to where\n      the scouts sit when they come in from the desert. They sit by their\n      camels, and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the\n      corners, and the men eat by their side just like camels. Take me there!\"",
                "The camp was rough and rutty, and Dick stumbled many times over the stumps\n      of scrub. The scouts were sitting by their beasts, as Dick knew they\n      would. The light of the dung-fires flickered on their bearded faces, and\n      the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest. It was no part of\n      Dick's policy to go into the desert with a convoy of supplies. That would\n      lead to impertinent questions, and since a blind non-combatant is not\n      needed at the front, he would probably be forced to return to Suakin.",
                "He must go up alone, and go immediately.",
                "\"Now for one last bluff -- the biggest of all,\" he said. \"Peace be with\n      you, brethren!\" The watchful George steered him to the circle of the\n      nearest fire. The heads of the camel-sheiks bowed gravely, and the camels,\n      scenting a European, looked sideways curiously like brooding hens, half\n      ready to get to their feet.",
                "\"A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight,\" said Dick.",
                "\"A Mulaid?\" said a voice, scornfully naming the best baggage-breed that he\n      knew.",
                "\"A Bisharin,\" returned Dick, with perfect gravity. \"A Bisharin without\n      saddle-galls. Therefore no charge of thine, shock-head.\"",
                "Two or three minutes passed. Then -- \"We be knee-haltered for the\n      night. There is no going out from the camp.\"",
                "\"Not for money?\"",
                "\"H'm! Ah! English money?\"",
                "Another depressing interval of silence.",
                "\"How much?\"",
                "\"Twenty-five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my\n      journey's end, and as much more into the hand of the camel-sheik here, to\n      be paid when the driver returns.\"",
                "This was royal payment, and the sheik, who knew that he would get his\n      commission on this deposit, stirred in Dick's behalf.",
                "\"For scarcely one night's journey -- fifty pounds. Land and wells and\n      good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days. Who\n      speaks?\" said Dick.",
                "\"I,\" said a voice. \"I will go -- but there is no going from the camp.\"",
                "\"Fool! I know that a camel can break his knee-halter, and the sentries do\n      not fire if one goes in chase. Twenty-five pounds and another twenty-five\n      pounds. But the beast must be a good Bisharin; I will take no\n      baggage-camel.\"",
                "Then the bargaining began, and at the end of half an hour the first\n      deposit was paid over to the sheik, who talked in low tones to the driver.",
                "Dick heard the latter say: \"A little way out only. Any baggage-beast will\n      serve. Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man?\"",
                "\"And though I cannot see\" -- Dick lifted his voice a little -- \"yet\n      I carry that which has six eyes, and the driver will sit before me. If we\n      do not reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead.\"",
                "\"But where, in God's name, are the troops?\"",
                "\"Unless thou knowest let another man ride. Dost thou know? Remember it\n      will be life or death to thee.\"",
                "\"I know,\" said the driver, sullenly. \"Stand back from my beast. I am going\n      to slip him.\"",
                "\"Not so swiftly. George, hold the camel's head a moment. I want to feel\n      his cheek.\" The hands wandered over the hide till they found the branded\n      half-circle that is the mark of the Biharin, the light-built riding-camel.",
                "\"That is well. Cut this one loose. Remember no blessing of God comes on\n      those who try to cheat the blind.\"",
                "The men chuckled by the fires at the camel-driver's discomfiture. He had\n      intended to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt.",
                "\"Stand back!\" one shouted, lashing the Biharin under the belly with a\n      quirt. Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose-string tighten in his hand, -- and\n      a cry went up, \"Illaha! Aho! He is loose.\"",
                "With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward\n      toward the desert, his driver following with shouts and lamentation.",
                "George caught Dick's arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a\n      disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels.",
                "\"What's the row now?\" he cried.",
                "\"Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary,\" Dick answered, after\n      the manner of a common soldier.",
                "\"Go on, and take care your throat's not cut outside -- you and your\n      dromedary's.\"",
                "The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock, and\n      his driver had called him back and made him kneel down.",
                "\"Mount first,\" said Dick. Then climbing into the second seat and gently\n      screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion's back, \"Go on\n      in God's name, and swiftly. Goodbye, George. Remember me to Madame, and\n      have a good time with your girl. Get forward, child of the Pit!\"",
                "A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence, hardly broken by\n      the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet. Dick\n      adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace, girthed\n      his belt tighter, and felt the darkness slide past. For an hour he was\n      conscious only of the sense of rapid progress.",
                "\"A good camel,\" he said at last.",
                "\"He was never underfed. He is my own and clean bred,\" the driver replied.",
                "\"Go on.\"",
                "His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think, but the tenor of his\n      thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy. In the half doze in seemed\n      that he was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs. Jennett's. He had committed\n      some crime as bad as Sabbath-breaking, and she had locked him up in his\n      bedroom. But he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the\n      hymn --",
                "When Israel of the Lord believed Out of the land of bondage came.",
                "He said them over and over thousands of times. The driver turned in the\n      saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and\n      ending the ride. Dick roused, struck him over the head with the butt, and\n      stormed himself wide awake. Somebody hidden in a clump of camel-thorn\n      shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground. A shot was fired, and the\n      silence shut down again, bringing the desire to sleep. Dick could think no\n      longer. He was too tired and stiff and cramped to do more than nod\n      uneasily from time to time, waking with a start and punching the driver\n      with the pistol.",
                "\"Is there a moon?\" he asked drowsily.",
                "\"She is near her setting.\"",
                "\"I wish that I could see her. Halt the camel. At least let me hear the\n      desert talk.\"",
                "The man obeyed. Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind. It\n      rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased. A\n      handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and\n      crumbled softly to the bottom.",
                "\"Go on. The night is very cold.\"",
                "Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the\n      light lengthens itself into many eternities. It seemed to Dick that he had\n      never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save\n      jolt through the air. Once in a thousand years he would finger the\n      nailheads on the saddle-front and count them all carefully. Centuries\n      later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his left and\n      allow the eased arm to drop down at his side. From the safe distance of\n      London he was watching himself thus employed, -- watching critically.\n      Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might paint the\n      tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon, the black shadow\n      of a camel and the two bowed figures atop, that hand held a revolver and\n      the arm was numbed from wrist to collar-bone. Moreover, he was in the\n      dark, and could see no canvas of any kind whatever.",
                "The driver grunted, and Dick was conscious of a change in the air.",
                "\"I smell the dawn,\" he whispered.",
                "\"It is here, and yonder are the troops. Have I done well?\"",
                "The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the\n      pungent reek of camels in the square.",
                "\"Go on. We must get there swiftly. Go on.\"",
                "\"They are moving in their camp. There is so much dust that I cannot see\n      what they do.\"",
                "\"Am I in better case? Go forward.\"",
                "They could hear the hum of voices ahead, the howling and the bubbling of\n      the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day.",
                "Two or three shots were fired.",
                "\"Is that at us? Surely they can see that I am English,\" Dick spoke\n      angrily.",
                "\"Nay, it is from the desert,\" the driver answered, cowering in his saddle.",
                "\"Go forward, my child! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour\n      ago.\"",
                "The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied.\n      The children of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of\n      surprises, a dawn attack for the English troops, and were getting their\n      distance by snap-shots at the only moving object without the square.",
                "\"What luck! What stupendous and imperial luck!\" said Dick. \"It's 'just\n      before the battle, mother.' Oh, God has been most good to me! Only\" -- the\n      agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instant -- \"Maisie...\"",
                "\"Allahu! We are in,\" said the man, as he drove into the rearguard and the\n      camel knelt.",
                "\"Who the deuce are you? Despatches or what? What's the strength of the\n      enemy behind that ridge? How did you get through?\" asked a dozen voices.\n      For all answer Dick took a long breath, unbuckled his belt, and shouted\n      from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice, \"Torpenhow! Ohe,\n      Torp! Coo-ee, Tor-pen-how.\"",
                "A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved\n      very swiftly towards that cry, as the rearguard, facing about, began to\n      fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around. Gradually the\n      scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white\n      that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned over\n      wave-like and glided into the valleys. The soldiers in the square were\n      coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view, and they\n      edged forward to get beyond it. A wounded camel leaped to its feet and\n      roared aloud, the cry ending in a bubbling grunt. Some one had cut its\n      throat to prevent confusion. Then came the thick sob of a man receiving\n      his death-wound from a bullet; then a yell of agony and redoubled firing.",
                "There was no time to ask any questions.",
                "\"Get down, man! Get down behind the camel!\"",
                "\"No. Put me, I pray, in the forefront of the battle.\" Dick turned his face\n      to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight, but,\n      miscalculating the distance, knocked it off. Torpenhow saw that his hair\n      was gray on the temples, and that his face was the face of an old man.",
                "\"Come down, you damned fool! Dickie, come off!\"",
                "And Dick came obediently, but as a tree falls, pitching sideways from the\n      Bisharin's saddle at Torpenhow's feet. His luck had held to the last, even\n      to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head.",
                "Torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel, with Dick's body in his arms.",

I acknowledge that you paid\n      the money at once, but you have prejudiced the mind of Mrs. Mafflin\n      against myself, for though I am almost the only respectable friend of your\n      bachelor days, she has been darwaza band to me throughout the season.\n      Further, she caused you to invite me to dinner at the Club, where you\n      called me \"a wild ass of the desert,\" and went home at half-past ten,\n      after discoursing for twenty minutes on the responsibilities of\n      housekeeping. You now drive a mail-phaeton and sit under a Church of\n      England clergyman. I am not angry, Jack. It is your kismet, as it was\n      Gaddy's, and his kismet who can avoid? Do not think that I am moved by a\n      spirit of revenge as I write, thus publicly, that you and you alone are\n      responsible for this book. In other and more expansive days, when you\n      could look at a magnum without flushing and at a cheroot without turning\n      white, you supplied me with most of the material.

You may even\n      invite me to another very bad dinner -- at the Club, which, as you and\n      your wife know, is a safe neutral ground for the entertainment of wild\n      asses.

                "Miss D. Who is this Captain Gadsby? I don't think I've met him.",
                "Miss T. You must have. He belongs to the Harrar set. I've danced with him,\n      but I've never talked to him. He's a big yellow man, just like a\n      newly-hatched chicken, with an enormous moustache. He walks like this\n      (imitates Cavalry swagger), and he goes \"Ha-Hmmm!\" deep down in his throat\n      when he can't think of anything to say. Mamma likes him. I don't.",

                "Capt. G. (Aside.) It was a nursery-tea and she's ashamed of it. By Jove!\n      She doesn't look half bad when she colors up like that. (Aloud, helping\n      himself from the dish.) Have you seen those new chocolates at Peliti's?",
                "Miss T. No, I made these myself. What are they like?",
                "Capt. G. These! De-licious. (Aside.) And that's a fact.",

                "Capt. G. (Enthusiastically.) Not to compare with these. How d'you make\n      them? I can't get my khansamah to understand the simplest thing beyond\n      mutton and fowl.",
                "Miss T. Yes? I'm not a khansamah, you know. Perhaps you frighten him. You\n      should never frighten a servant. He loses his head. It's very bad policy.",
                "Capt. G. He's so awf'ly stupid.",
                "Miss T. (Folding her hands in her lap.) You should call him quietly and\n      say: 'O khansamah jee!'",
                "Capt. G. (Getting interested.) Yes? (Aside.) Fancy that little\n      featherweight saying, 'O khansamah jee' to my bloodthirsty Mir Khan!",
                "Miss T Then you should explain the dinner, dish by dish.",
                "Capt. G. But I can't speak the vernacular.",
                "Miss T. (Patronizingly.) You should pass the Higher Standard and try.",
                "Capt. G. I have, but I don't seem to be any the wiser. Are you?",
                "Miss T. I never passed the Higher Standard. But the khansamah is very\n      patient with me. He doesn't get angry when I talk about sheep's topees, or\n      order maunds of grain when I mean seers.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside with intense indignation.) I'd like to see Mir Khan being\n      rude to that girl! Hullo! Steady the Buffs! (Aloud.) And do you understand\n      about horses, too?",
                "Miss T. A little -- not very much. I can't doctor them, but I know what\n      they ought to eat, and I am in charge of our stable.",
                "Capt. G. Indeed! You might help me then. What ought a man to give his sais\n      in the Hills? My ruffian says eight rupees, because everything is so dear.",
                "Miss T. Six rupees a month, and one rupee Simla allowance -- neither\n      more nor less. And a grass-cut gets six rupees. That's better than buying\n      grass in the bazar.",
                "Capt. G. (Admiringly.) How do you know?",
                "Miss T. I have tried both ways.",
                "Capt. G. Do you ride much, then? I've never seen you on the Mall.",
                "Miss T. (Aside.) I haven't passed him more than fifty times. (Aloud.)\n      Nearly every day.",
                "Capt. G. By Jove! I didn't know that. Ha-Hmmm (Pulls at his moustache and\n      is silent for forty seconds.)",
                "Miss T. (Desperately, and wondering what will happen next.) It looks\n      beautiful. I shouldn't touch it if I were you. (Aside.) It's all Mamma's\n      fault for not coming before. I will be rude!",
                "Capt. G. (Bronzing under the tan and bringing down his hand very quickly.)\n      Eh! Wha-at! Oh, yes! Ha! Ha! (Laughs uneasily.) (Aside.) Well, of all the\n      dashed cheek! I never had a woman say that to me yet. She must be a cool\n      hand or else -- Ah! that nursery-tea!",
                "VOICE PROM THE UNKNOWN. Tchk! Tchk! Tchk!",
                "Capt. G. Good gracious! What's that?",
                "Miss T. The dog, I think. (Aside.) Emma has been listening, and I'll never\n      forgive her!",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) They don't keep dogs here. (Aloud.) Didn't sound like a\n      dog, did it?",
                "Miss T. Then it must have been the cat. Let's go into the veranda. What a\n      lovely evening it is!",
                "Steps into veranda and looks out across the hills into sunset. The CAPTAIN\n      follows.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Superb eyes! I wonder that I never noticed them before!\n      (Aloud.) There's going to be a dance at Viceregal Lodge on Wednesday. Can\n      you spare me one?",
                "Miss T. (Shortly.) No! I don't want any of your charity-dances. You only\n      ask me because Mamma told you to. I hop and I bump. You know I do!",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) That's true, but little girls shouldn't understand these\n      things. (Aloud.) No, on my word, I don't. You dance beautifully.",
                "Miss T. Then why do you always stand out after half a dozen turns? I\n      thought officers in the Army didn't tell fibs.",
                "Capt. G. It wasn't a fib, believe me. I really do want the pleasure of a\n      dance with you.",
                "Miss T. (Wickedly.) Why? Won't Mamma dance with you any more?",
                "Capt. G. (More earnestly than the necessity demands.) I wasn't thinking of\n      your Mother. (Aside.) You little vixen!",
                "Miss T. (Still looking out of the window.) Eh? Oh, I beg your pardon. I\n      was thinking of something else.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Well! I wonder what she'll say next. I've never known a\n      woman treat me like this before. I might b -- Dash it, I might be an\n      Infantry subaltern! (Aloud.) Oh, please don't trouble. I'm not worth\n      thinking about. Isn't your Mother ready yet?",
                "Miss T. I should think so; but promise me, Captain Gamsby, you won't take\n      poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more. It tires her so.",
                "Capt. G. She says that no exercise tires her.",
                "Miss T. Yes, but she suffers afterward. You don't know what rheumatism is,\n      and you oughtn't to keep her out so late, when it gets chill in the\n      evenings.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Rheumatism. I thought she came off her horse rather in a\n      bunch. Whew! One lives and learns. (Aloud.) I'm sorry to hear that. She\n      hasn't mentioned it to me.",
                "Miss T. (Flurried.) Of course not! Poor dear Mamma never would. And you\n      mustn't say that I told you either. Promise me that you won't. Oh, Captain\n      Gamsby, promise me you won't!",
                "Capt. G. I am dumb, or -- I shall be as soon as you've given me that\n      dance, and another -- if you can trouble yourself to think about me for\n      a minute.",
                "Miss T. But you won't like it one little bit. You'll be awfully sorry\n      afterward.",
                "Capt. G. I shall like it above all things, and I shall only be sorry that\n      I didn't get more. (Aside.) Now what in the world am I saying?",
                "Miss T. Very well. You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are\n      trodden on. Shall we say Seven?",
                "Capt. G. And Eleven. (Aside.) She can't be more than eight stone, but,\n      even then, it's an absurdly small foot. (Looks at his own riding boots.)",
                "Miss T. They're beautifully shiny. I can almost see my face in them.",
                "Capt. G. I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the\n      rest of my life if you trod on my toes.",
                "Miss T. Very likely. Why not change Eleven for a square?",
                "Capt. G. No, please! I want them both waltzes. Won't you write them down?",
                "Miss T. I don't get so many dances that I shall confuse them. You will be\n      the offender.",
                "Capt. G. Wait and see! (Aside.) She doesn't dance perfectly, perhaps, but --",
                "Miss T. Your tea must have got cold by this time. Won't you have another\n      cup?",
                "Capt. G. No, thanks. Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda?\n      (Aside.) I never saw hair take that color in the sunshine before. (Aloud.)\n      It's like one of Dicksee's pictures.",
                "Miss T. Yes I It's a wonderful sunset, isn't it? (Bluntly.) But what do\n      you know about Dicksee's pictures?",
                "Capt. G. I go Home occasionally. And I used to know the Galleries.\n      (Nervously.) You mustn't think me only a Philistine with a moustache.",
                "Miss T. Don't! Please don't. I'm so sorry for what I said then. I was\n      horribly rude. It slipped out before j thought. Don't you know the\n      temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of\n      saying them? I'm afraid I gave way to it.",
                "Capt. G. (Watching the girl as she flushes.) I think I know the feeling.\n      It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it? For instance, I\n      might say --",
                "POOR DEAR MAMMA. (Entering, habited, hatted, and booted.) Ah, Captain\n      Gamsby? 'Sorry to keep you waiting. 'Hope you haven't been bored. 'My\n      little girl been talking to you?",
                "Miss T. (Aside.) I'm not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism. I'm not! I'm\n      NOT! I only wished I'd mentioned the corns too.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) What a shame! I wonder how old she is. It never occurred\n      to me before. (Aloud.) We've been discussing 'Shakespeare and the musical\n      glasses' in the veranda.",
                "Miss T. (Aside.) Nice man! He knows that quotation. He isn't a Philistine\n      with a moustache. (Aloud.) Goodbye, Captain Gadsby. (Aside.) What a huge\n      hand and what a squeeze! I don't suppose he meant it, but he has driven\n      the rings into my fingers.",
                "Poor Dear Mamma. Has Vermillion come round yet? Oh, yes! Captain Gadsby,\n      don't you think that the saddle is too far forward? (They pass into the\n      front veranda.)",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I know what she prefers? She told\n      me that she doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.",
                "Miss T. (Coming out into front veranda.) Oh! Bad Buldoo! I must speak to\n      him for this. He has taken up the curb two links, and Vermillion bates\n      that. (Passes out and to horse's head.)",
                "Capt. G. Let me do it!",
                "Miss. T. No, Vermillion understands me. Don't you, old man? (Loosens\n      curb-chain skilfully, and pats horse on nose and throttle.) Poor\n      Vermillion! Did they want to cut his chin off? There!",

It was only the other day I went\n      home with them in the Surat -- no, the Massilia -- and she was\n      crawling about on her hands and knees among the ayahs. 'Used to call me\n      the \"Tick Tack Sahib\" because I showed her my watch. And that was in\n      Sixty-Seven -- no, Seventy. Good God, how time flies! I'm an old man. I\n      remember when Threegan married Miss Derwent -- daughter of old Hooky\n      Derwent -- but that was before your time.

                "Mackesy. If a man's once taken that way nothing will hold him, Do you\n      remember Benoit of your service, Doone? They transferred him to Tharanda\n      when his time came, and he married a platelayer's daughter, or something\n      of that kind. She was the only female about the place.",
                "Doone. Yes, poor brute. That smashed Benoit's chances of promotion\n      altogether. Mrs. Benoit used to ask \"Was you goin' to the dance this\n      evenin'?\"",

                "Jervoise. Tar-brush! Not an anna. You young fellows talk as though the man\n      was doing the girl an honor in marrying her. You're all too conceited -- nothing's\n      good enough for you.",
                "Blayne. Not even an empty Club, a dam' bad dinner at the Judge's, and a\n      Station as sickly as a hospital. You're quite right. We're a set of\n      Sybarites.",
                "Doone. Luxurious dogs, wallowing in --",

                "Curtiss. No, worse luck. Two cases yesterday -- one died -- and if\n      we have a third, out we go. Is there any shooting at Beora, Doone?",
                "Doone. The country's under water, except the patch by the Grand Trunk\n      Road. I was there yesterday, looking at a bund, and came across four poor\n      devils in their last stage. It's rather bad from here to Kuchara.",
                "Curtiss. Then we're pretty certain to have a heavy go of it. Heigho! I\n      shouldn't mind changing places with Gaddy for a while. 'Sport with\n      Amaryllis in the shade of the Town Hall, and all that. Oh, why doesn't\n      somebody come and marry me, instead of letting me go into cholera-camp?",
                "Mackesy. Ask the Committee.",
                "Curtiss. You ruffian! You'll stand me another peg for that. Blayne, what\n      will you take? Mackesy is fine on moral grounds. Done, have you any\n      preference?",
                "Doone. Small glass Kummel, please. Excellent carminative, these days.\n      Anthony told me so.",
                "Mackesy. (Signing voucher for four drinks.) Most unfair punishment. I only\n      thought of Curtiss as Actaeon being chivied round the billiard tables by\n      the nymphs of Diana.",
                "Blayne. Curtiss would have to import his nymphs by train. Mrs. Cockley's\n      the only woman in the Station. She won't leave Cockley, and he's doing his\n      best to get her to go.",
                "Curtiss. Good, indeed! Here's Mrs. Cockley's health. To the only wife in\n      the Station and a damned brave woman!",

                "Curtiss. Gadsby may thank his luck that the Pink Hussars are all\n      detachment and no headquarters this hot weather, or he'd be torn from the\n      arms of his love as sure as death. Have you ever noticed the\n      thorough-minded way British Cavalry take to cholera? It's because they are\n      so expensive. If the Pinks had stood fast here, they would have been out\n      in camp a month ago. Yes, I should decidedly like to be Gadsby.",
                "Mackesy. He'll go Home after he's married, and send in his papers -- see\n      if he doesn't.",
                "Blayne. Why shouldn't he? Hasn't he money? Would any one of us be here if\n      we weren't paupers?",
                "Doone. Poor old pauper! What has become of the six hundred you rooked from\n      our table last month?",
                "Blayne. It took unto itself wings. I think an enterprising tradesman got\n      some of it, and a shroff gobbled the rest -- or else I spent it.",
                "Curtiss. Gadsby never had dealings with a shroff in his life.",
                "Doone. Virtuous Gadsby! If I had three thousand a month, paid from\n      England, I don't think I'd deal with a shroff either.",
                "Mackesy. (Yawning.) Oh, it's a sweet life! I wonder whether matrimony\n      would make it sweeter.",
                "Curtiss. Ask Cockley -- with his wife dying by inches!",
                "Blayne. Go home and get a fool of a girl to come out to -- what is it\n      Thackeray says? -- \"the splendid palace of an Indian pro-consul.\"",
                "Doone. Which reminds me. My quarters leak like a sieve. I had fever last\n      night from sleeping in a swamp. And the worst of it is, one can't do\n      anything to a roof till the Rains are over.",
                "Curtiss. What's wrong with you? You haven't eighty rotting Tommies to take\n      into a running stream.",
                "Doone. No: but I'm mixed boils and bad language. I'm a regular Job all\n      over my body. It's sheer poverty of blood, and I don't see any chance of\n      getting richer -- either way.",
                "Blayne. Can't you take leave?",
                "Doone. That's the pull you Army men have over us. Ten days are nothing in\n      your sight. I'm so important that Government can't find a substitute if I\n      go away. Ye-es, I'd like to be Gadsby, whoever his wife may be.",
                "Curtiss. You've passed the turn of life that Mackesy was speaking of.",
                "Doone. Indeed I have, but I never yet had the brutality to ask a woman to\n      share my life out here.",
                "Blayne. On my soul I believe you're right. I'm thinking of Mrs. Cockley.\n      The woman's an absolute wreck.",
                "Doone. Exactly. Because she stays down here. The only way to keep her fit\n      would be to send her to the Hills for eight months -- and the same with\n      any woman. I fancy I see myself taking a wife on those terms.",
                "Mackesy. With the rupee at one and sixpence. The little Doones would be\n      little Debra Doones, with a fine Mussoorie @chi-chi anent to bring home\n      for the holidays.",
                "Curtiss. And a pair of be-ewtiful sambhur -- horns for Doone to wear,\n      free of expense, presented by -- Doone. Yes, it's an enchanting\n      prospect. By the way, the rupee hasn't done falling yet. The time will\n      come when we shall think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay.",
                "Curtiss. Surely a third's loss enough. Who gains by the arrangement?\n      That's what I want to know.",
                "Blayne. The Silver Question! I'm going to bed if you begin squabbling\n      Thank Goodness, here's Anthony -- looking like a ghost.",

                "Curtiss. How's Mingle?",
                "Anthony. Very bad, and more frightened. I handed him over to Fewton.\n      Mingle might just as well have called him in the first place, instead of\n      bothering me.",
                "Blayne. He's a nervous little chap. What has he got, this time?",
                "Anthony. 'Can't quite say. A very bad tummy and a blue funk so far. He\n      asked me at once if it was cholera, and I told him not to be a fool. That\n      soothed him.",
                "Curtiss. Poor devil! The funk does half the business in a man of that\n      build.",
                "Anthony. (Lighting a cheroot.) I firmly believe the funk will kill him if\n      he stays down. You know the amount of trouble he's been giving Fewton for\n      the last three weeks. He's doing his very best to frighten himself into\n      the grave.",
                "GENERAL CHORUS. Poor little devil! Why doesn't he get away?",
                "Anthony. 'Can't. He has his leave all right, but he's so dipped he can't\n      take it, and I don't think his name on paper would raise four annas.\n      That's in confidence, though.",
                "Mackesy. All the Station knows it.",
                "Anthony. \"I suppose I shall have to die here,\" he said, squirming all\n      across the bed. He's quite made up his mind to Kingdom Come. And I know he\n      has nothing more than a wet-weather tummy if he could only keep a hand on\n      himself.",
                "Blayne. That's bad. That's very bad. Poor little Miggy. Good little chap,\n      too. I say --",
                "Anthony. What do you say?",
                "Blayne. Well, look here -- anyhow. If it's like that -- as you say -- I\n      say fifty.",
                "Curtiss. I say fifty.",
                "Mackesy. I go twenty better.",
                "Doone. Bloated Croesus of the Bar! I say fifty. Jervoise, what do you say?\n      Hi! Wake up!",
                "Jervoise. Eh? What's that? What's that?",
                "Curtiss. We want a hundred rupees from you. You're a bachelor drawing a\n      gigantic income, and there's a man in a hole.",
                "Jervoise. What man? Any one dead?",
                "Blayne. No, but he'll die if you don't -- give the hundred. Here!\n      Here's a peg-voucher. You can see what we've signed for, and Anthony's man\n      will come round tomorrow to collect it. So there will be no trouble.",
                "Jervoise. (Signing.) One hundred, E. M. J. There you are (feebly). It\n      isn't one of your jokes, is it?",
                "Blayne. No, it really is wanted. Anthony, you were the biggest\n      poker-winner last week, and you've defrauded the tax-collector too long.\n      Sign!",
                "Anthony. Let's see. Three fifties and a seventy-two twenty-three twenty -- say\n      four hundred and twenty. That'll give him a month clear at the Hills. Many\n      thanks, you men. I'll send round the chaprassi tomorrow.",
                "Curtiss. You must engineer his taking the stuff, and of course you mustn't --",
                "Anthony. Of course. It would never do. He'd weep with gratitude over his\n      evening drink.",
                "Blayne. That's just what he would do, damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you\n      pretend to know everything. Have you heard about Gadsby?",
                "Anthony. No. Divorce Court at last?",
                "Blayne. Worse. He's engaged!",
                "Anthony. How much? He can't be!",
                "Blayne. He is. He's going to be married in a few weeks. Markyn told me at\n      the Judge's this evening. It's pukka.",
                "Anthony. You don't say so? Holy Moses! There'll be a shine in the tents of\n      Kedar.",
                "Curtiss. 'Regiment cut up rough, think you?",
                "Anthony. 'Don't know anything about the Regiment.",
                "Mackesy. It is bigamy, then?",
                "Anthony. Maybe. Do you mean to say that you men have forgotten, or is\n      there more charity in the world than I thought?",
                "Doone. You don't look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret. You\n      bloat. Explain.",
                "Anthony. Mrs. Herriott!",
                "Blayne. (After a long pause, to the room generally.) It's my notion that\n      we are a set of fools.",
                "Mackesy. Nonsense. That business was knocked on the head last season. Why,\n      young Mallard --",
                "Anthony. Mallard was a candlestick, paraded as such. Think awhile.\n      Recollect last season and the talk then. Mallard or no Mallard, did Gadsby\n      ever talk to any other woman?",
                "Curtiss. There's something in that. It was slightly noticeable now you\n      come to mention it. But she's at Naini Tal and he's at Simla.",
                "Anthony. He had to go to Simla to look after a globe-trotter relative of\n      his -- a person with a title. Uncle or aunt.",
                "Blayne And there he got engaged. No law prevents a man growing tired of a\n      woman.",
                "Anthony. Except that he mustn't do it till the woman is tired of him. And\n      the Herriott woman was not that.",
                "Curtiss. She may be now. Two months of Naini Tal works wonders.",
                "Doone. Curious thing how some women carry a Fate with them. There was a\n      Mrs. Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men invariably fell away and\n      got married. It became a regular proverb with us when I was down there. I\n      remember three men desperately devoted to her, and they all, one after\n      another, took wives.",
                "Curtiss. That's odd. Now I should have thought that Mrs. Deegie's\n      influence would have led them to take other men's wives. It ought to have\n      made them afraid of the judgment of Providence.",
                "Anthony. Mrs. Herriott will make Gadsby afraid of something more than the\n      judgment of Providence, I fancy.",
                "Blayne. Supposing things are as you say, he'll be a fool to face her.\n      He'll sit tight at Simla.",
                "Anthony. Shouldn't be a bit surprised if he went off to Naini to explain.\n      He's an unaccountable sort of man, and she's likely to be a more than\n      unaccountable woman.",
                "Doone. What makes you take her character away so confidently?",
                "Anthony. Primum tempus. Caddy was her first and a woman doesn't allow her\n      first man to drop away without expostulation. She justifies the first\n      transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever and ever.\n      Consequently --",
                "Blayne. Consequently, we are sitting here till past one o'clock, talking\n      scandal like a set of Station cats. Anthony, it's all your fault. We were\n      perfectly respectable till you came in. Go to bed. I'm off, Good night\n      all.",
                "Curtiss. Past one! It's past two by Jove, and here's the khit coming for\n      the late charge. Just Heavens! One, two, three, four, five rupees to pay\n      for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is no\n      better than she should be. I'm ashamed of myself. Go to bed, you\n      slanderous villains, and if I'm sent to Beora tomorrow, be prepared to\n      hear I'm dead before paying my card account!"

                "Mrs. H. Have I done anything to offend you? I never meant it if I have. I\n      couldn't help going for a ride with the Vaynor man. It was promised a week\n      before you came up.",

                "Capt. G. Have you?",
                "Mrs. H. You know I have! I've been as foolish as a schoolgirl about it. I\n      made a little calendar and put it in my card-case, and every time the\n      twelve o'clock gun went off I scratched out a square and said: \"That\n      brings me nearer to Pip. My Pip!\"",

                "Mrs. H. Tell me now. It must be some foolish misunderstanding, and you\n      know that there was to be nothing of that sort between us. We, of all\n      people in the world, can't afford it. Is it the Vaynor man, and don't you\n      like to say so? On my honor --",

D'you remember that evening in July, before the\n      Rains broke, when you said that the end would have to come sooner or later -- and\n      you wondered for which of US it would come first?",

                "Mrs. H. (Her eyes on the tablecloth: fan ready in right hand.) It was very\n      cleverly managed, Pip, and I congratulate you. You swore -- you never\n      contented yourself with merely Saying a thing -- you swore that, as far\n      as lay in your power, you'd make my wretched life pleasant for me. And\n      you've denied me the consolation of breaking down. I should have done it -- indeed\n      I should. A woman would hardly have thought of this refinement, my kind,\n      considerate friend. (Fan-guard as before.) You have explained things so\n      tenderly and truthfully, too! You haven't spoken or written a word of\n      warning, and you have let me believe in you till the last minute. You\n      haven't condescended to give me your reason yet. No! A woman could not\n      have managed it half so well. Are there many men like you in the world?",
                "Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. (To Khitmatgar.) Ohe! Simpkin do.",
                "Mrs. H. You call yourself a man of the world, don't you? Do men of the\n      world behave like Devils when they do a woman the honor to get tired of\n      her?",
                "Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. Don't speak so loud!",
                "Mrs. H. Keep us respectable, O Lord, whatever happens. Don't be afraid of\n      my compromising you. You've chosen your ground far too well, and I've been\n      properly brought up. (Lowering fan.) Haven't you any pity, Pip, except for\n      yourself?",
                "Capt. G. Wouldn't it be rather impertinent of me to say that I'm sorry for\n      you?",
                "Mrs. H. I think you have said it once or twice before. You're growing very\n      careful of my feelings. My God, Pip, I was a good woman once! You said I\n      was. You've made me what I am. What are you going to do with me? What are\n      you going to do with me? Won't you say that you are sorry? (Helps herself\n      to iced asparagus.)",
                "Capt. G. I am sorry for you, if you WANT the pity of such a brute as I am.\n      I'm awf'ly sorry for you.",
                "Mrs. H. Rather tame for a man of the world. Do you think that that\n      admission clears you?",
                "Capt. G. What can I do? I can only tell you what I think of myself. You\n      can't think worse than that?",
                "Mrs. H. Oh, yes, I can! And now, will you tell me the reason of all this?\n      Remorse? Has Bayard been suddenly conscience-stricken?",
                "Capt. G. (Angrily, his eyes still lowered.) No! The thing has come to an\n      end on my side. That's all. Mafisch!",
                "Mrs. H. \"That's all. Mafisch!\" As though I were a Cairene Dragoman. You\n      used to make prettier speeches. D'you remember when you said? --",
                "Capt. G. For Heaven's sake don't bring that back! Call me anything you\n      like and I'll admit it --",
                "Mrs. H. But you don't care to be reminded of old lies? If I could hope to\n      hurt you one-tenth as much as you have hurt me tonight -- No, I\n      wouldn't -- I couldn't do it -- liar though you are.",
                "Capt. G. I've spoken the truth.",
                "Mrs. H. My dear Sir, you flatter yourself. You have lied over the reason.\n      Pip, remember that I know you as you don't know yourself. You have been\n      everything to me, though you are -- (Fan-guard.) Oh, what a\n      contemptible Thing it is! And so you are merely tired of me?",
                "Capt. G. Since you insist upon my repeating it -- Yes.",
                "Mrs. H. Lie the first. I wish I knew a coarser word. Lie seems so\n      ineffectual in your case. The fire has just died out and there is no fresh\n      one? Think for a minute, Pip, if you care whether I despise you more than\n      I do. Simply Mafisch, is it?",
                "Capt. G. Yes. (Aside.) I think I deserve this.",
                "Mrs. H. Lie number two. Before the next glass chokes you, tell me her\n      name.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) I'll make her pay for dragging Minnie into the business!\n      (Aloud.) Is it likely?",
                "Mrs. H. Very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity.\n      You'd cry my name on the house-tops to make people turn round.",
                "Capt. G. I wish I had. There would have been an end to this business.",
                "Mrs. H. Oh, no, there would not -- And so you were going to be virtuous\n      and blase', were you? To come to me and say: \"I've done with you. The\n      incident is clo-osed.\" I ought to be proud of having kept such a man so\n      long.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) It only remains to pray for the end of the dinner.\n      (Aloud.) You know what I think of myself.",
                "Mrs. H. As it's the only person in he world you ever do think of, and as I\n      know your mind thoroughly, I do. You want to get it all over and -- Oh,\n      I can't keep you back! And you're going -- think of it, Pip -- to\n      throw me over for another woman. And you swore that all other women were -- Pip,\n      my Pip! She can't care for you as I do. Believe me, she can't. Is it any\n      one that I know?",
                "Capt. G. Thank Goodness it isn't. (Aside.) I expected a cyclone, but not\n      an earthquake.",
                "Mrs. H. She can't! Is there anything that I wouldn't do for you -- or\n      haven't done? And to think that I should take this trouble over you,\n      knowing what you are! Do you despise me for it?",
                "Capt. G. (Wiping his mouth to hide a smile.) Again? It's entirely a work\n      of charity on your part.",
                "Mrs. H. Ahhh! But I have no right to resent it. -- Is she\n      better-looking than I? Who was it said? --",
                "Capt. G. No -- not that!",
                "Mrs. H. I'll be more merciful than you were. Don't you know that all women\n      are alike?",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Then this is the exception that proves the rule.",
                "Mrs. H. All of them! I'll tell you anything you like. I will, upon my\n      word! They only want the admiration -- from anybody -- no matter who -- anybody!\n      But there is always one man that they care for more than any one else in\n      the world, and would sacrifice all the others to. Oh, do listen! I've kept\n      the Vaynor man trotting after me like a poodle, and he believes that he is\n      the only man I am interested in. I'll tell you what he said to me.",
                "Capt. G. Spare him. (Aside.) I wonder what his version is.",
                "Mrs. H. He's been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner. Shall\n      I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks?",
                "Capt. G. \"But what imports the nomination of this gentleman?\"",
                "Mrs. H. Watch! (Sends a glance to the Vaynor man, who tries vainly to\n      combine a mouthful of ice pudding, a smirk of self-satisfaction, a glare\n      of intense devotion, and the stolidity of a British dining countenance.)",
                "Capt. G. (Critically.) He doesn't look pretty. Why didn't you wait till\n      the spoon was out of his mouth?",
                "Mrs. H. To amuse you. She'll make an exhibition of you as I've made of\n      him; and people will laugh at you. Oh, Pip, can't you see that? It's as\n      plain as the noonday Sun. You'll be trotted about and told lies, and made\n      a fool of like the others. I never made a fool of you, did I?",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) What a clever little woman it is!",
                "Mrs. H. Well, what have you to say?",
                "Capt. G. I feel better.",
                "Mrs. H. Yes, I suppose so, after I have come down to your level. I\n      couldn't have done it if I hadn't cared for you so much. I have spoken the\n      truth.",
                "Capt. G. It doesn't alter the situation.",
                "Mrs. H. (Passionately.) Then she has said that she cares for you! Don't\n      believe her, Pip. It's a lie -- as bad as yours to me!",
                "Capt. G. Ssssteady! I've a notion that a friend of yours is looking at\n      you.",
                "Mrs. H. He! I hate him. He introduced you to me.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) And some people would like women to assist in making the\n      laws. Introduction to imply condonement. (Aloud.) Well, you see, if you\n      can remember so far back as that, I couldn't, in common politeness, refuse\n      the offer.",
                "Mrs. H. In common politeness I -- We have got beyond that!",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Old ground means fresh trouble. (Aloud.) On my honor --",
                "Mrs. H. Your what? Ha, ha!",
                "Capt. G. Dishonor, then. She's not what you imagine. I meant to --",
                "Mrs. H. Don't tell me anything about her! She won't care for you, and when\n      you come back, after having made an exhibition of yourself, you'll find me\n      occupied with --",
                "Capt. G. (Insolently.) You couldn't while I am alive. (Aside.) If that\n      doesn't bring her pride to her rescue, nothing will.",
                "Mrs. H. (Drawing herself up.) Couldn't do it? I -- (Softening.) You're\n      right. I don't believe I could -- though you are what you are -- a\n      coward and a liar in grain.",
                "Capt. G. It doesn't hurt so much after your little lecture -- with\n      demonstrations.",
                "Mrs. H. One mass of vanity! Will nothing ever touch you in this life?\n      There must be a Hereafter if it's only for the benefit of -- But you\n      will have it all to yourself.",
                "Capt. G. (Under his eyebrows.) Are you certain of that?",
                "Mrs. H. I shall have had mine in this life; and it will serve me right,",
                "Capt. G. But the admiration that you insisted on so strongly a moment ago?\n      (Aside.) Oh, I am a brute!",
                "Mrs. H. (Fiercely.) Will that console me for knowing that you will go to\n      her with the same words, the same arguments, and the -- the same pet\n      names you used to me? And if she cares for you, you two will laugh over my\n      story. Won't that be punishment heavy enough even for me -- even for\n      me? -- And it's all useless. That's another punishment.",
                "Capt. G. (Feebly.) Oh, come! I'm not so low as you think.",
                "Mrs. H. Not now, perhaps, but you will be. Oh, Pip, if a woman flatters\n      your vanity, there's nothing on earth that you would not tell her; and no\n      meanness that you would not do. Have I known you so long without knowing\n      that?",
                "Capt. G. If you can trust me in nothing else -- and I don't see why I\n      should be trusted -- you can count upon my holding my tongue.",
                "Mrs. H. If you denied everything you've said this evening and declared it\n      was all in fun (a long pause), I'd trust you. Not otherwise. All I ask is,\n      don't tell her my name. Please don't. A man might forget: a woman never\n      would. (Looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect eyes.) So\n      it's all ended, through no fault of mine -- Haven't I behaved\n      beautifully? I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly\n      as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I? (Arranging\n      gloves and fan.) I only pray that she'll know you some day as I know you\n      now. I wouldn't be you then, for I think even your conceit will be hurt. I\n      hope she'll pay you back the humiliation you've brought on me. I hope -- No.\n      I don't! I can't give you up! I must have something to look forward to or\n      I shall go crazy. When it's all over, come back to me, come back to me,\n      and you'll find that you're my Pip still!",
                "Capt. G. (Very clearly.) False move, and you pay for it. It's a girl!",
                "Mrs. H. (Rising.) Then it was true! They said -- but I wouldn't insult\n      you by asking. A girl! I was a girl not very long ago. Be good to her,\n      Pip. I daresay she believes in you.",

                "Mrs. G. (Haltingly, her eyes lowered.) You told me once in the old days -- centuries\n      and centuries ago -- that you had been engaged before. I didn't say\n      anything -- then.",

                "Capt. G. There's nothing to tell. I was awf'ly old then -- nearly two\n      and twenty -- and she was quite that.",
                "Mrs. G. That means she was older than you. I shouldn't like her to have\n      been younger. Well?",
                "Capt. G. Well, I fancied myself in love and raved about a bit, and -- oh,\n      yes, by Jove! I made up poetry. Ha! Ha!",
                "Mrs. G. You never wrote any for me! What happened?",
                "Capt. G. I came out here, and the whole thing went phut. She wrote to say\n      that there had been a mistake, and then she married.",
                "Mrs. G. Did she care for you much?",
                "Capt. G. No. At least she didn't show it as far as I remember.",

                "Mrs. G. Good Heavens, Phil! I never knew that you could speak in that\n      terrible voice.",
                "Capt. G. You don't know half my accomplishments yet. Wait till we are\n      settled in the Plains, and I'll show you how I bark at my troop. You were\n      going to say, darling?",
                "Mrs. G. I -- I don't like to, after that voice. (Tremulously.) Phil,\n      never you dare to speak to me in that tone, whatever I may do!",
                "Capt. G. My poor little love! Why, you're shaking all over. I am so sorry.\n      Of course I never meant to upset you Don't tell me anything, I'm a brute.",
                "Mrs. G. No, you aren't, and I will tell -- There was a man.",
                "Capt. G. (Lightly.) Was there? Lucky man!",
                "Mrs. G. (In a whisper.) And I thought I cared for him.",
                "Capt. G. Still luckier man! Well?",
                "Mrs. G. And I thought I cared for him -- and I didn't -- and then\n      you came -- and I cared for you very, very much indeed. That's all.\n      (Face hidden.) You aren't angry, are you?",
                "Capt. G. Angry? Not in the least. (Aside.) Good Lord, what have I done to\n      deserve this angel?",
                "Mrs. G. (Aside.) And he never asked for the name! How funny men are! But\n      perhaps it's as well.",
                "Capt. G. That man will go to heaven because you once thought you cared for\n      him. 'Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
                "Mrs. G. (Firmly.) 'Sha'n't go if you don't.",
                "Capt. G. Thanks. I say, Pussy, I don't know much about your religious\n      beliefs. You were brought up to believe in a heaven and all that, weren't\n      you?",
                "Mrs. G. Yes. But it was a pincushion heaven, with hymn-books in all the\n      pews.",
                "Capt. G. (Wagging his head with intense conviction.) Never mind. There is\n      a pukka heaven.",
                "Mrs. G. Where do you bring that message from, my prophet?",
                "Capt. G. Here! Because we care for each other. So it's all right.",
                "Mrs. G. (As a troop of langurs crash through the branches.) So it's all\n      right. But Darwin says that we came from those!",
                "Capt. G. (Placidly.) Ah! Darwin was never in love with an angel. That\n      settles it. Sstt, you brutes! Monkeys, indeed! You shouldn't read those\n      books.",
                "Mrs. G. (Folding her hands.) If it pleases my Lord the King to issue\n      proclamation.",
                "Capt. G. Don't, dear one. There are no orders between us. Only I'd rather\n      you didn't. They lead to nothing, and bother people's heads.",
                "Mrs. G. Like your first engagement.",
                "Capt. G. (With an immense calm.) That was a necessary evil and led to you.\n      Are you nothing?",
                "Mrs. G. Not so very much, am I?",
                "Capt. G. All this world and the next to me.",

                "Capt. G. Yes, if it's not dreadful -- about other men.",
                "Mrs. G. It's about my own bad little self.",
                "Capt. G. Then it must be good. Go on, dear.",
                "Mrs. G. (Slowly.) I don't know why I'm telling you, Pip; but if ever you\n      marry again -- (Interlude.) Take your hand from my mouth or I'll bite!\n      In the future, then remember -- I don't know quite how to put it!",
                "Capt. G. (Snorting indignantly.) Don't try. \"Marry again,\" indeed!",
                "Mrs. G. I must. Listen, my husband. Never, never, never tell your wife\n      anything that you do not wish her to remember and think over all her life.\n      Because a woman -- yes, I am a woman -- can't forget.",
                "Capt. G. By Jove, how do you know that?",
                "Mrs. G. (Confusedly.) I don't. I'm only guessing. I am -- I was -- a\n      silly little girl; but I feel that I know so much, oh, so very much more\n      than you, dearest. To begin with, I'm your wife.",
                "Capt. G. So I have been led to believe.",

                "Mrs. G. For your own sake don't stop me, Phil. I shall never talk to you\n      in this way again. You must not tell me! At least, not now. Later on, when\n      I'm an old matron it won't matter, but if you love me, be very good to me\n      now; for this part of my life I shall never forget! Have I made you\n      understand?",
                "Capt. G. I think so, child. Have I said anything yet that you disapprove\n      of?",
                "Mrs. G. Will you be very angry? That -- that voice, and what you said\n      about the engagement --",
                "Capt. G. But you asked to be told that, darling.",
                "Mrs. G. And that's why you shouldn't have told me! You must be the Judge,\n      and, oh, Pip, dearly as I love you, I shan't be able to help you! I shall\n      hinder you, and you must judge in spite of me!",
                "Capt. G. (Meditatively.) We have a great many things to find out together,\n      God help us both -- say so, Pussy -- but we shall understand each\n      other better every day; and I think I'm beginning to see now. How in the\n      world did you come to know just the importance of giving me just that\n      lead?",
                "Mrs. G. I've told you that I don't know. Only somehow it seemed that, in\n      all this new life, I was being guided for your sake as well as my own.",

                "Mrs. G. (With round-eyed reproach.) I've scalded it aw-fully! Aren't you\n      sorry? And I did so want that jam to jam properly.",
                "Capt. G. Poor little woman! Let me kiss the place and make it well.\n      (Unrolling bandage.) You small sinner! Where's that scald? I can't see it.",
                "Mrs. G. On the top of the little finger. There! -- It's a most 'normous\n      big burn!",
                "Capt. G. (Kissing little finger.) Baby! Let Hyder look after the jam. You\n      know I don't care for sweets.",
                "Mrs. G. Indeed? -- Pip!",
                "Capt. G. Not of that kind, anyhow. And now run along, Minnie, and leave me\n      to my own base devices. I'm busy.",
                "Mrs. G. (Calmly settling herself in long chair.) So I see. What a mess\n      you're making! Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the\n      house?",
                "Capt. G. To play with. Do you mind, dear?",
                "Mrs. G. Let me play too. I'd like it.",
                "Capt. G. I'm afraid you wouldn't. Pussy -- Don't you think that jam\n      will burn, or whatever it is that jam does when it's not looked after by a\n      clever little housekeeper?",
                "Mrs. G. I thought you said Hyder could attend to it. I left him in the\n      veranda, stirring -- when I hurt myself so.",
                "Capt. G. (His eye returning to the equipment.) Po-oor little woman! -- Three\n      pounds four and seven is three eleven, and that can be cut down to two\n      eight, with just a lee-tle care, without weakening anything. Farriery is\n      all rot in incompetent hands. What's the use of a shoe-case when a man's\n      scouting? He can't stick it on with a lick -- like a stamp -- the\n      shoe! Skittles --",
                "Mrs. G. What's skittles? Pah! What is this leather cleaned with?",
                "Capt. G. Cream and champagne and -- Look here, dear, do you really want\n      to talk to me about anything important?",
                "Mrs. G. No. I've done my accounts, and I thought I'd like to see what\n      you're doing.",
                "Capt. G. Well, love, now you've seen and -- Would you mind? -- That\n      is to say -- Minnie, I really am busy.",
                "Mrs. G. You want me to go?",
                "Capt. G, Yes, dear, for a little while. This tobacco will hang in your\n      dress, and saddlery doesn't interest you.",
                "Mrs. G. Everything you do interests me, Pip.",
                "Capt. G. Yes, I know, I know, dear. I'll tell you all about it some day\n      when I've put a head on this thing. In the meantime --",
                "Mrs. G. I'm to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child?",
                "Capt. G. No-o. I don't mean that exactly. But, you see, I shall be\n      tramping up and down, shifting these things to and fro, and I shall be in\n      your way. Don't you think so?",
                "Mrs. G. Can't I lift them about? Let me try. (Reaches forward to trooper's\n      saddle.)",
                "Capt. G. Good gracious, child, don't touch it. You'll hurt yourself.\n      (Picking up saddle.) Little girls aren't expected to handle numdahs. Now,\n      where would you like it put? (Holds saddle above his head.)",
                "Mrs. G. (A break in her voice.) Nowhere. Pip, how good you are -- and\n      how strong! Oh, what's that ugly red streak inside your arm?",
                "Capt. G. (Lowering saddle quickly.) Nothing. It's a mark of sorts.\n      (Aside.) And Jack's coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried!",
                "Mrs. G. I know it's a mark, but I've never seen it before. It runs all up\n      the arm. What is it?",
                "Capt. G. A cut -- if you want to know.",
                "Mrs. G. Want to know! Of course I do! I can't have my husband cut to\n      pieces in this way. How did it come? Was it an accident? Tell me, Pip.",
                "Capt. G. (Grimly.) No. 'Twasn't an accident. I got it -- from a man -- in\n      Afghanistan.",
                "Mrs. G. In action? Oh, Pip, and you never told me!",
                "Capt. G. I'd forgotten all about it.",
                "Mrs. G. Hold up your arm! What a horrid, ugly scar! Are you sure it\n      doesn't hurt now! How did the man give it you?",
                "Capt. G. (Desperately looking at his watch.) With a knife. I came down -- old\n      Van Loo did, that's to say -- and fell on my leg, so I couldn't run.\n      And then this man came up and began chopping at me as I sprawled.",
                "Mrs. G. Oh, don't, don't! That's enough! -- Well, what happened?",
                "Capt. G. I couldn't get to my holster, and Mafflin came round the corner\n      and stopped the performance.",
                "Mrs. G. How? He's such a lazy man, I don't believe he did.",
                "Capt. G. Don't you? I don't think the man had much doubt about it. Jack\n      cut his head off.",
                "Mrs. G. Cut-his-head-off! \"With one blow,\" as they say in the books?",
                "Capt. G. I'm not sure. I was too interested in myself to know much about\n      it. Anyhow, the head was off, and Jack was punching old Van Loo in the\n      ribs to make him get up. Now you know all about it, dear, and now --",
                "Mrs. G. You want me to go, of course. You never told me about this, though\n      I've been married to you for ever so long; and you never would have told\n      me if I hadn't found out; and you never do tell me anything about\n      yourself, or what you do, or what you take an interest in.",
                "Capt. G. Darling, I'm always with you, aren't I?",
                "Mrs. G. Always in my pocket, you were going to say. I know you are; but\n      you are always thinking away from me.",
                "Capt. G. (Trying to hide a smile.) Am I? I wasn't aware of it. I'm awf'ly\n      sorry.",
                "Mrs. G. (Piteously.) Oh, don't make fun of me! Pip, you know what I mean.\n      When you are reading one of those things about Cavalry, by that idiotic\n      Prince -- why doesn't he be a Prince instead of a stable-boy?",
                "Capt. G. Prince Kraft a stable-boy -- Oh, my Aunt! Never mind, dear.\n      You were going to say?",
                "Mrs. G. It doesn't matter; you don't care for what I say. Only -- only\n      you get up and walk about the room, staring in front of you, and then\n      Mafflin comes in to dinner, and after I'm in the drawing-room I can hear\n      you and him talking, and talking, and talking, about things I can't\n      understand, and -- oh, I get so tired and feel so lonely! -- I don't\n      want to complain and be a trouble, Pip; but I do indeed I do!",
                "Capt. G. My poor darling! I never thought of that. Why don't you ask some\n      nice people in to dinner?",
                "Mrs. G. Nice people! Where am I to find them? Horrid frumps! And if I did,\n      I shouldn't be amused. You know I only want you.",
                "Capt. G. And you have me surely, Sweetheart?",
                "Mrs. G. I have not! Pip why don't you take me into your life?",
                "Capt. G. More than I do? That would be difficult, dear.",
                "Mrs. G. Yes, I suppose it would -- to you. I'm no help to you -- no\n      companion to you; and you like to have it so.",
                "Capt. G. Aren't you a little unreasonable, Pussy?",
                "Mrs. G. (Stamping her foot.) I'm the most reasonable woman in the world -- when\n      I'm treated properly.",
                "Capt. G. And since when have I been treating you improperly?",
                "Mrs. G. Always -- and since the beginning. You know you have.",
                "Capt. G. I don't; but I'm willing to be convinced.",
                "Mrs. G. (Pointing to saddlery.) There!",
                "Capt. G. How do you mean?",
                "Mrs. G. What does all that mean? Why am I not to be told? Is it so\n      precious?",
                "Capt. G. I forget its exact Government value just at present. It means\n      that it is a great deal too heavy.",
                "Mrs. G. Then why do you touch it?",
                "Capt. G. To make it lighter. See here, little love, I've one notion and\n      Jack has another, but we are both agreed that all this equipment is about\n      thirty pounds too heavy. The thing is how to cut it down without weakening\n      any part of it, and, at the same time, allowing the trooper to carry\n      everything he wants for his own comfort -- socks and shirts and things\n      of that kind.",
                "Mrs. G. Why doesn't he pack them in a little trunk?",
                "Capt. G. (Kissing her.) Oh, you darling! Pack them in a little trunk,\n      indeed! Hussars don't carry trunks, and it's a most important thing to\n      make the horse do all the carrying.",
                "Mrs. G. But why need you bother about it? You're not a trooper.",
                "Capt. G. No; but I command a few score of him; and equipment is nearly\n      everything in these days.",
                "Mrs. G. More than me?",
                "Capt. G. Stupid! Of course not; but it's a matter that I'm tremendously\n      interested in, because if I or Jack, or I and Jack, work out some sort of\n      lighter saddlery and all that, it's possible that we may get it adopted.",
                "Mrs. G. How?",
                "Capt. G. Sanctioned at Home, where they will make a sealed pattern -- a\n      pattern that all the saddlers must copy -- and so it will be used by\n      all the regiments.",
                "Mrs. G. And that interests you?",
                "Capt. G. It's part of my profession, y'know, and my profession is a good\n      deal to me. Everything in a soldier's equipment is important, and if we\n      can improve that equipment, so much the better for the soldiers and for\n      us.",
                "Mrs. G. Who's \"us\"?",
                "Capt. G. Jack and I; only Jack's notions are too radical. What's that big\n      sigh for, Minnie?",
                "Mrs. G. Oh, nothing -- and you've kept all this a secret from me! Why?",
                "Capt. G. Not a secret, exactly, dear. I didn't say anything about it to\n      you because I didn't think it would amuse you.",
                "Mrs. G. And am I only made to be amused?",
                "Capt. G. No, of course. I merely mean that it couldn't interest you.",
                "Mrs. G. It's your work and -- and if you'd let me, I'd count all these\n      things up. If they are too heavy, you know by how much they are too heavy,\n      and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of lightness,\n      and --",
                "Capt. G. I have got both scales somewhere in my head; but it's hard to\n      tell how light you can make a head-stall, for instance, until you've\n      actually had a model made.",
                "Mrs. G. But if you read out the list, I could copy it down, and pin it up\n      there just above your table. Wouldn't that do?",
                "Capt. G. It would be awf'ly nice, dear, but it would be giving you trouble\n      for nothing. I can't work that way. I go by rule of thumb. I know the\n      present scale of weights, and the other one -- the one that I'm trying\n      to work to -- will shift and vary so much that I couldn't be certain,\n      even if I wrote it down.",
                "Mrs. G. I'm so sorry. I thought I might help. Is there anything else that\n      I could be of use in?",
                "Capt. G. (Looking round the room.) I can't think of anything. You're\n      always helping me you know.",
                "Mrs. G. Am I? How?",
                "Capt. G. You are of course, and as long as you're near me -- I can't\n      explain exactly, but it's in the air.",
                "Mrs. G. And that's why you wanted to send me away?",
                "Capt. G. That's only when I'm trying to do work -- grubby work like\n      this.",
                "Mrs. G. Mafflin's better, then, isn't he?",
                "Capt. G. (Rashly.) Of course he is. Jack and I have been thinking along\n      the same groove for two or three years about this equipment. It's our hobby,\n      and it may really be useful some day.",
                "Mrs. G. (After a pause.) And that's all that you have away from me?",
                "Capt. G. It isn't very far away from you now. Take care the oil on that\n      bit doesn't come off on your dress.",
                "Mrs. G. I wish -- I wish so much that I could really help you. I\n      believe I could -- if I left the room. But that's not what I mean.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Give me patience! I wish she would go. (Aloud.) I assure\n      you you can't do anything for me, Minnie, and I must really settle down to\n      this. Where's my pouch?",
                "Mrs. G. (Crossing to writing-table.) Here you are, Bear. What a mess you\n      keep your table in!",
                "Capt. G. Don' ttouch it. There's a method in my madness, though you\n      mightn't think of it.",
                "Mrs. G. (At table.) I want to look -- Do you keep accounts, Pip?",
                "Capt. G. (Bending over saddlery.) Of a sort. Are you rummaging among the\n      Troop papers? Be careful.",
                "Mrs. G. Why? I sha'n't disturb anything. Good gracious! I had no idea that\n      you had anything to do with so many sick horses.",
                "Capt. G. 'Wish I hadn't, but they insist on falling sick. Minnie, if 1\n      were you I really should not investigate those papers. You may come across\n      something that you won't like.",
                "Mrs. G. Why will you always treat me like a child? I know I'm not\n      displacing the horrid things.",
                "Capt. G. (Resignedly.) Very well, then. Don't blame me if anything\n      happens. Play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery. (Slipping\n      hand into trousers-pocket.) Oh, the deuce!",
                "Mrs. G. (Her back to G.) What's that for?",
                "Capt. G. Nothing. (Aside.) There's not much in it, but I wish I'd torn it\n      up.",
                "Mrs. G. (Turning over contents of table.) I know you'll hate me for this;\n      but I do want to see what your work is like. (A pause.) Pip, what are\n      \"farcybuds\"?",
                "Capt. G. Hah! Would you really like to know? They aren't pretty things.",
                "Mrs. G. This Journal of Veterinary Science says they are of \"absorbing\n      interest.\" Tell me.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) It may turn her attention.",
                "Gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy.",
                "Mrs. G. Oh, that's enough. Don't go on!",
                "Capt. G. But you wanted to know -- Then these things suppurate and\n      matterate and spread --",
                "Mrs. G. Pin, you're making me sick! You're a horrid, disgusting schoolboy.",
                "Capt. G. (On his knees among the bridles.) You asked to be told. It's not\n      my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors.",
                "Mrs. G. Why didn't you say No?",
                "Capt. G. Good Heavens, child! Have you come in here simply to bully me?",
                "Mrs. G. I bully you? How could I! You're so strong. (Hysterically.) Strong\n      enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me there to\n      cry. Aren't you?",
                "Capt. G. It seems to me that you're an irrational little baby. Are you\n      quite well?",
                "Mrs. G. Do I look ill? (Returning to table). Who is your lady friend with\n      the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Then it wasn't locked up, confound it. (Aloud.) \"God\n      made her, therefore let her pass for a woman.\" You remember what farcybuds\n      are like?",
                "Mrs. G. (Showing envelope.) This has nothing to do with them. I'm going to\n      open it. May I?",
                "Capt. G. Certainly, if you want to. I'd sooner you didn't though. I don't\n      ask to look at your letters to the Deercourt girl.",
                "Mrs. G. You'd better not, Sir! (Takes letter from envelope.) Now, may I\n      look? If you say no, I shall cry.",
                "Capt. G. You've never cried in my knowledge of you, and I don't believe\n      you could.",
                "Mrs. G. I feel very like it today, Pip. Don't be hard on me. (Reads\n      letter.) It begins in the middle, without any \"Dear Captain Gadsby,\" or\n      anything. How funny!",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) No, it's not Dear Captain Gadsby, or anything, now. How\n      funny!",
                "Mrs. G. What a strange letter! (Reads.) \"And so the moth has come too near\n      the candle at last, and has been singed into -- shall I say\n      Respectability? I congratulate him, and hope he will be as happy as he\n      deserves to be.\" What does that mean? Is she congratulating you about our\n      marriage?",
                "Capt. G. Yes, I suppose so.",
                "Mrs. G. (Still reading letter.) She seems to be a particular friend of\n      yours.",
                "Capt. G. Yes. She was an excellent matron of sorts -- a Mrs. Herriott -- wife\n      of a Colonel Herriott. I used to know some of her people at Home long ago -- before\n      I came out.",
                "Mrs. G. Some Colonel's wives are young -- as young as me. I knew one\n      who was younger.",
                "Capt. G. Then it couldn't have been Mrs. Herriott. She was old enough to\n      have been your mother, dear.",
                "Mrs. G. I remember now. Mrs. Scargill was talking about her at the\n      Dutfins' tennis, before you came for me, on Tuesday. Captain Mafflin said\n      she was a \"dear old woman.\" Do you know, I think Mafflin is a very clumsy\n      man with his feet.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) Good old Jack! (Aloud.) Why, dear?",
                "Mrs. G. He had put his cup down on the ground then, and he literally\n      stepped into it. Some of the tea spirted over my dress -- the grey one.\n      I meant to tell you about it before.",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) There are the makings of a strategist about Jack though\n      his methods are coarse. (Aloud.) You'd better get a new dress, then.\n      (Aside.) Let us pray that that will turn her.",
                "Mrs. G. Oh, it isn't stained in the least. I only thought that I'd tell\n      you. (Returning to letter.) What an extraordinary person! (Reads.) \"But\n      need I remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of wardship\" -- what\n      in the world is a charge of wardship? -- \"which as you yourself know,\n      may end in Consequences\" --",
                "Capt. G. (Aside.) It's safest to let em see everything as they come across\n      it; but 'seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule. (Aloud.) I\n      told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging my table.",

                "Capt. G. When you write to the Deercourt girl, I notice that you generally\n      fill three or four sheets. Can't you let an old woman babble on paper once\n      in a way? She means well.",

                "Capt. M. Bosh! The Brigadier's jumping out of his skin with pure\n      condition. He's got a muzzle like a rose-leaf and the chest of a\n      two-year-old. What's demoralized you?",
                "Capt. G. Funk. That's the long and the short of it. Funk!",

                "Capt. M. Are you sure? Looking at the matter in a cold-blooded light, the\n      Wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight. She has an\n      ancestral home to go to, money and the Brigadier to carry on the\n      illustrious name.",
                "Capt. G. Then it is for myself or because they are part of me. You don't\n      see it. My life's so good, so pleasant, as it is, that I want to make it\n      quite safe. Can't you understand?",
                "Capt. M. Perfectly. \"Shelter-pit for the Off'cer's charger,\" as they say\n      in the Line.",

                "Capt. G. (Lowering voice.) It never passes with me, Jack. I'm always\n      thinking about it. Phil Gadsby funking a fall on parade! Sweet picture,\n      isn't it! Draw it for me.",
                "Capt. M. (Gravely.) Heaven forbid! A man like you can't be as bad as that.\n      A fall is no nice thing, but one never gives it a thought.",
                "Capt. G. Doesn't one? Wait till you've got a wife and a youngster of your\n      own, and then you'll know how the roar of the squadron behind you turns\n      you cold all up the back.",
                "Capt. M. (Aside.) And this man led at Amdheran after Bagal Deasin went\n      under, and we were all mixed up together, and he came out of the snow\n      dripping like a butcher. (Aloud.) Skittles! The men can always open out,\n      and you can always pick your way more or less. We haven't the dust to\n      bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a\n      man?",
                "Capt. G. Never -- as long as he can see. But did they open out for poor\n      Errington?",
                "Capt. M. Oh, this is childish!",
                "Capt. G. I know it is, worse than that. I don't care. You've ridden Van\n      Loo. Is he the sort of brute to pick his way -- 'specially when we're\n      coming up in column of troop with any pace on?",
                "Capt. M. Once in a Blue Moon do we gallop in column of troop, and then\n      only to save time. Aren't three lengths enough for you?",
                "Capt. G. Yes -- quite enough. They just allow for the full development\n      of the smash. I'm talking like a cur, I know: but I tell you that, for the\n      past three months, I've felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of my\n      back every time that I've led.",
                "Capt. M. But, Gaddy, this is awful!",
                "Capt. G. Isn't it lovely? Isn't it royal? A Captain of the Pink Hussars\n      watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing Colonel of\n      a Black Regiment!",
                "Capt. M. You never did!",
                "Capt. G. Once only. He squelched like a mussuck, and the\n      Troop-Sergeant-Major cocked his eye at me. You know old Haffy's eye. I was\n      afraid to do it again.",
                "Capt. M. I should think so. That was the best way to rupture old Van Loo's\n      tummy, and make him crumple you up. You knew that.",
                "Capt. G. I didn't care. It took the edge off him.",
                "Capt. M. \"Took the edge off him\"? Gaddy, you -- you -- you mustn't,\n      you know! Think of the men.",
                "Capt. G. That's another thing I am afraid of. D'you s'pose they know?",
                "Capt. M. Let's hope not; but they're deadly quick to spot skirm -- little\n      things of that kind. See here, old man, send the Wife Home for the hot\n      weather and come to Kashmir with me. We'll start a boat on the Dal or\n      cross the Rhotang -- shoot ibex or loaf -- which you please. Only\n      come! You're a bit off your oats and you're talking nonsense. Look at the\n      Colonel -- swag-bellied rascal that he is. He has a wife and no end of\n      a bow-window of his own. Can any one of us ride round him -- chalkstones\n      and all? I can't, and I think I can shove a crock along a bit.",
                "Capt. G. Some men are different. I haven't any nerve. Lord help me, I\n      haven't the nerve! I've taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well\n      under the wallets. I can't help it. I'm so afraid of anything happening to\n      me. On my soul, I ought to be broke in front of the squadron, for\n      cowardice.",
                "Capt. M. Ugly word, that. I should never have the courage to own up.",
                "Capt. G. I meant to lie about my reasons when I began, but -- I've got\n      out of the habit of lying to you, old man. Jack, you won't? -- But I\n      know you won't.",
                "Capt. M. Of course not. (Half aloud.) The Pinks are paying dearly for\n      their Pride.",
                "Capt. G. Eh! Wha-at?",
                "Capt. M. Don't you know? The men have called Mrs. Gadsby the Pride of the\n      Pink Hussars ever since she came to us.",

                "Capt. G. Don't make me feel worse than I do. Will it satisfy you if I own\n      that I am a shirker, a skrim-shanker, and a coward?",
                "Capt. M. It will not, because I'm the only man in the world who can talk\n      to you like this without being knocked down. You mustn't take all that\n      I've said to heart in this way. I only spoke -- a lot of it at least -- out\n      of pure selfishness, because, because -- Oh, damn it all, old man, -- I\n      don't know what I shall do without you. Of course, you've got the money\n      and the place and all that -- and there are two very good reasons why\n      you should take care of yourself.",

                "Capt. G. Thank you, Jack. It's a kind lie, but it's the blackest you've\n      told for some time. I know what I'm doing, and I'm going into it with my\n      eyes open. Old man, I can't help it. What would you do if you were in my\n      place?",

I'm an ungrateful ruffian to say this, but\n      marriage -- even as good a marriage as mine has been -- hampers a\n      man's work, it cripples his sword-arm, and oh, it plays Hell with his\n      notions of duty. Sometimes -- good and sweet as she is -- sometimes\n      I could wish that I had kept my freedom -- No, I don't mean that\n      exactly.",

                "Capt. M. We'll see. I must be off to make a Troop Cook desperately\n      unhappy. I won't have the wily Hussar fed on Government Bullock Train\n      shinbones -- (Hastily.) Surely black ants can't be good for The\n      Brigadier. He's picking em off the matting and eating 'em. Here, Senor\n      Comandante Don Grubbynose, come and talk to me. (Lifts G.

The night was stiflingly hot, and as Hans Breitmann and I\n      passed him, dragging our bedding to the fore-peak of the steamer, he\n      roused himself and chattered obscenely. He had been caught somewhere in\n      the Malayan Archipelago, and was going to England to be exhibited at a\n      shilling a head. For four days he had struggled, yelled, and wrenched at\n      the heavy iron bars of his prison without ceasing, and had nearly slain a\n      Lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw.",
                "\"It would be well for you, mine friend, if you was a liddle seasick,\" said\n      Hans Breitmann, pausing by the cage. \"You haf too much Ego in your\n      Cosmos.\"",
                "The orangoutang's arm slid out negligently from between the bars. No one\n      would have believed that it would make a sudden snake-like rush at the\n      German's breast. The thin silk of the sleeping-suit tore out: Hans stepped\n      back unconcernedly, to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close to one of\n      the boats.",
                "\"Too much Ego,\" said he, peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged\n      devil, who was rending the silk to tatters.",
                "Then we laid out our bedding in the bows, among the sleeping Lascars, to\n      catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us. The sea was like\n      smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled\n      back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a thunderstorm some\n      miles away: we could see the glimmer of the lightning. The ship's cow,\n      distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in the cage, lowed\n      unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as the lookout man at\n      the bows answered the hourly call from the bridge. The trampling tune of\n      the engines was very distinct, and the jarring of the ash-lift, as it was\n      tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of hushed noise. Hans lay down by\n      my side and lighted a good-night cigar. This was naturally the beginning\n      of conversation. He owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the sea, and\n      stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself; for his business in life\n      was to wander up and down the world, collecting orchids and wild beasts\n      and ethnological specimens for German and American dealers. I watched the\n      glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom, as the sentences rose\n      and fell, till I was nearly asleep. The orangoutang, troubled by some\n      dream of the forests of his freedom, began to yell like a soul in\n      purgatory, and to wrench madly at the bars of the cage.",
                "\"If he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabouts,\" said\n      Hans, lazily. \"He screams good. See, now, how I shall tame him when he\n      stops himself.\"",
                "There was a pause in the outcry, and from Hans' mouth came an imitation of\n      a snake's hiss, so perfect that I almost sprung to my feet. The sustained\n      murderous sound ran along the deck, and the wrenching at the bars ceased.\n      The orangoutang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror.",
                "\"Dot stop him,\" said Hans. \"I learned dot trick in Mogoung Tanjong when I\n      was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in Berlin.

                "ONCE upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to Thibet, very\n      many miles in the Himalaya Mountains. His kingdom was 11,000 feet above\n      the sea, and exactly four miles square, but most of the miles stood on\n      end, owing to the nature of the country. His revenues were rather less\n      than 400 pounds yearly, and they were expended on the maintenance of one\n      elephant and a standing army of five men. He was tributary to the Indian\n      government, who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the\n      Himalaya-Thibet road in repair. He further increased his revenues by\n      selling timber to the railway companies, for he would cut the great deodar\n      trees in his own forest and they fell thundering into the Sutlej River and\n      were swept down to the Plains, 300 miles away, and became railway ties.\n      Now and again this king, whose name does not matter, would mount a\n      ring-streaked horse and ride scores of miles to Simlatown to confer with\n      the lieutenant-governor on matters of state, or assure the viceroy that\n      his sword was at the service of the queen-empress. Then the viceroy would\n      cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the ring-streaked horse and the\n      cavalry of the state -- two men in tatters -- and the herald who\n      bore the Silver Stick before the king would trot back to their own place,\n      which was between the tail of a heaven-climbing glacier and a dark birch\n      forest.",
                "Now, from such a king, always remembering that he possessed one veritable\n      elephant and could count his descent for 1,200 years, I expected, when it\n      was my fate to wander through his dominions, no more than mere license to\n      live.",
                "The night had closed in rain, and rolling clouds blotted out the lights of\n      the villages in the valley. Forty miles away, untouched by cloud or storm,\n      the white shoulder of Dongo Pa -- the Mountain of the Council of the\n      Gods -- upheld the evening star. The monkeys sung sorrowfully to each\n      other as they hunted for dry roots in the fern-draped trees, and the last\n      puff of the day-wind brought from the unseen villages the scent of damp\n      wood smoke, hot cakes, dripping undergrowth, and rotting pine-cones. That\n      smell is the true smell of the Himalayas, and if it once gets into the\n      blood of a man he will, at the last, forgetting everything else, return to\n      the Hills to die. The clouds closed and the smell went away, and there\n      remained nothing in all the world except chilling white mists and the boom\n      of the Sutlej River.",
                "A fat-tailed sheep, who did not want to die, bleated lamentably at my\n      tent-door. He was scuffling with the prime minister and the\n      director-general of public education, and he was a royal gift to me and my\n      camp servants. I expressed my thanks suitably and inquired if I might have\n      audience of the king. The prime minister readjusted his turban -- it\n      had fallen off in the struggle -- and assured me that the king would be\n      very pleased to see me. Therefore I dispatched two bottles as a foretaste,\n      and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation, climbed up to the\n      king's palace through the wet. He had sent his army to escort me, but it\n      stayed to talk with my cook. Soldiers are very much alike all the world\n      over.",
                "The palace was a four-roomed, white-washed mud-and-timber house, the\n      finest in all the Hills for a day's journey. The king was dressed in a\n      purple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban\n      of price. He gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the\n      palace courtyard, which was occupied by the elephant of state. The great\n      beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail, and the curve of his\n      back stood out against the sky line.",
                "The prime minister and the director-general of public instruction were\n      present to introduce me; but all the court had been dismissed lest the two\n      bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The king cast a wreath of\n      heavy, scented flowers round my neck as I bowed, and inquired how my\n      honored presence had the felicity to be. I said that through seeing his\n      auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned into sunshine,\n      and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good deeds would be\n      remembered by the gods. He said that since I had set my magnificent foot\n      in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy per cent more than\n      the average. I said that the fame of the king had reached to the four\n      corners of the earth, and that the nations gnashed their teeth when they\n      heard daily of the glory of his realm and the wisdom of his moon-like\n      prime minister and lotus-eyed director-general of public education.",
                "Then we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the king's right\n      hand. Three minutes later he was telling me that the condition of the\n      maize crop was something disgraceful, and that the railway companies would\n      not pay him enough for his timber. The talk shifted to and fro with the\n      bottles. We discussed very many quaint things, and the king became\n      confidential on the subject of government generally. Most of all he dwelt\n      on the shortcomings of one of his subjects, who, from what I could gather,\n      had been paralyzing the executive.",
                "\"In the old days,\" said the king, \"I could have ordered the elephant\n      yonder to trample him to death. Now I must e'en send him seventy miles\n      across the hills to be tried, and his keep for that time would be upon the\n      state. And the elephant eats everything.\"",
                "\"What be the man's crimes, Rajah Sahib?\" said I.",
                "\"Firstly, he is an 'outlander,' and no man of mine own people. Secondly,\n      since of my favor I gave him land upon his coming, he refuses to pay\n      revenue. Am I not the lord of the earth, above and below -- entitled by\n      right and custom to one-eighth of the crop? Yet this devil, establishing\n      himself, refuses to pay a single tax... and he brings a poisonous spawn of\n      babes.\"",
                "\"Cast him into jail,\" I said.",
                "\"Sahib,\" the king answered, shifting a little on the cushions, \"once and\n      only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not\n      able to go abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would never\n      again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of God, for I\n      perceived the nature of the punishment. How can I break my vow? Were it\n      only the lopping off of a hand or a foot, I should not delay. But even\n      that is impossible now that the English have rule. One or another of my\n      people\" -- he looked obliquely at the director-general of public\n      education -- \"would at once write a letter to the viceroy, and perhaps\n      I should be deprived of that ruffle of drums.\"",
                "He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain amber\n      one, and passed the pipe to me. \"Not content with refusing revenue,\" he\n      continued, \"this outlander refuses also to beegar\" (this is the corvee or\n      forced labor on the roads), \"and stirs my people up to the like treason.\n      Yet he is, if so he wills, an expert log-snatcher. There is none better or\n      bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when the logs stick\n      fast.\"",
                "\"But he worships strange gods,\" said the prime minister, deferentially.",
                "\"For that I have no concern,\" said the king, who was as tolerant as Akbar\n      in matters of belief. \"To each man his own god, and the fire or Mother\n      Earth for us all at the last. It is the rebellion that offends me.\"",
                "\"The king has an army,\" I suggested. \"Has not the king burned the man's\n      house, and left him naked to the night dews?\"",
                "\"Nay. A hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once I sent my\n      army against him when his excuses became wearisome. Of their heads he\n      brake three across the top with a stick. The other two men ran away. Also\n      the guns would not shoot.\"",
                "I had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old\n      muzzle-loading fowling-piece with ragged rust holes where the nipples\n      should have been; one-third a wirebound matchlock with a worm-eaten stock,\n      and one-third a four-bore flint duck-gun, without a flint.",
                "\"But it is to be remembered,\" said the king, reaching out for the bottle,\n      \"that he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry face. What\n      shall I do to him, sahib?\"",
                "This was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused taxes\n      to their king as offerings to their gods. The rebel must be a man of\n      character.",
                "\"If it be the king's permission,\" I said, \"I will not strike my tents till\n      the third day, and I will see this man. The mercy of the king is godlike,\n      and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover, both the\n      bottles, and another, be empty.\"",
                "\"You have my leave to go,\" said the king.",
                "Next morning the crier went through the stare proclaiming that there was a\n      log-jam on the river and that it behooved all loyal subjects to clear it.\n      The people poured down from their villages to the moist, warm valley of\n      poppy fields, and the king and I went with them.",
                "Hundreds of dressed deodar logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the\n      river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade.\n      The water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber, while the\n      population of the state prodded at the nearest logs with poles, in the\n      hope of easing the pressure. Then there went up a shout of \"Namgay Doola!\n      Namgay Doola!\" and a large, red-haired villager hurried up, stripping off\n      his clothes as he ran.",
                "\"That he is. That is the rebel!\" said the king. \"Now will the dam be\n      cleared.\"",
                "\"But why has he red hair?\" I asked, since red hair among hill-folk is as\n      uncommon as blue or green.",
                "\"He is an outlander,\" said the king. \"Well done! Oh, well done!\"",
                "Namgay Doola had scrambled on the jam and was clawing out the butt of a\n      log with a rude sort of a boat-hook. It slid forward slowly, as an\n      alligator moves, and three or four others followed it. The green water\n      spouted through the gaps. Then the villagers howled and shouted and leaped\n      among the logs, pulling and pushing the obstinate timber, and the red head\n      of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The logs swayed and chafed and\n      groaned as fresh consignments from up-stream battered the now weakening\n      dam. It gave way at last in a smother of foam, racing butts, bobbing black\n      heads, and a confusion indescribable, as the river tossed everything\n      before it. I saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam\n      and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks. It rose close to the\n      hank, and blowing like a grampus, Namgay Doola wiped the water out of his\n      eyes and made obeisance to the king.",
                "I had time to observe the man closely. The virulent redness of his shock\n      head and beard was most startling, and in the thicket of hair twinkled\n      above high cheek-bones two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an\n      outlander, but yet a Thibetan in language, habit and attire. He spoke the\n      Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was\n      not so much a lisp as an accent.",
                "\"Whence comest thou?\" I asked, wondering.",
                "\"From Thibet.\" He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin went\n      straight to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola\n      took it. No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the\n      gesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed back to\n      his village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar. It\n      was the whooping of Namgay Doola.",
                "\"You see now,\" said the king, \"why I would not kill him. He is a bold man\n      among my logs, but,\" and he shook his head like a schoolmaster, \"I know\n      that before long there will be complaints of him in the court. Let us\n      return to the palace and do justice.\"",
                "It was that king's custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven\n      and three o'clock. I heard him do justice equitably on weighty matters of\n      trespass, slander, and a little wife-stealing. Then his brow clouded and\n      he summoned me.",
                "\"Again it is Namgay Doola,\" he said, despairingly. \"Not content with\n      refusing revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an oath\n      to the like treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me! Nor are my\n      taxes heavy.\"",
                "A rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear, advanced\n      trembling. He had been in Namgay Doola's conspiracy, but had told\n      everything and hoped for the king's favor.",
                "\"Oh, king!\" said I, \"if it be the king's will, let this matter stand over\n      till the morning. Only the gods can do right in a hurry, and it may be\n      that yonder villager has lied.\"",
                "\"Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks, let\n      the matter remain. Wilt thou, for my sake, speak harshly to this\n      red-headed outlander? He may listen to thee.\"",
                "I made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could not\n      keep my countenance. Namgay Doola grinned so persuasively and began to\n      tell me about a big brown bear in a poppy field by the river. Would I care\n      to shoot that bear? I spoke austerely on the sin of detected conspiracy\n      and the certainty of punishment. Namgay Doola's face clouded for a moment.\n      Shortly afterward he withdrew from my tent, and I heard him singing softly\n      among the pines. The words were unintelligible to me, but the tune, like\n      his liquid, insinuating speech, seemed the ghost of something strangely\n      familiar.",
                "\"Dir hane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee,\" crooned Namgay Doola again\n      and again, and I racked my brain for that lost tune. It was not till after\n      dinner that I discovered some one had cut a square foot of velvet from the\n      centre of my best camera-cloth. This made me so angry that I wandered down\n      the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown bear. I could hear him\n      grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy field as I waited shoulder\n      deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch him after his meal. The moon\n      was at full and drew out the scent of the tasseled crop. Then I heard the\n      anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow -- one of the little black crummies\n      no bigger than Newfoundland dogs. Two shadows that looked like a bear and\n      her cub hurried past me. I was in the act of firing when I saw that each\n      bore a brilliant red head. The lesser animal was trailing something\n      rope-like that left a dark track on the path. They were within six feet of\n      me, and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces.\n      Velvet-black was exactly the word, for by all the powers of moonlight they\n      were masked in the velvet of my camera-cloth. I marveled, and went to bed.",
                "Next morning the kingdom was in an uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had\n      gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a\n      cow belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was\n      sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow. The state desired his blood,\n      but he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with\n      big stones, and defied the world.",
                "The king and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously. There was\n      no hope of capturing our man without loss of life, for from a hole in the\n      wall projected the muzzle of an extremely well-cared-for gun -- the\n      only gun in the state that could shoot. Namgay Doola had narrowly missed a\n      villager just before we came up.",
                "The standing army stood.",
                "It could do no more, for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from\n      the windows. To these were added from time to time showers of scalding\n      water. We saw red beads bobbing up and down within. The family of Namgay\n      Doola were aiding their sire. Blood-curdling yells of defiance were the\n      only answer to our prayers.",
                "\"Never,\" said the king, puffing, \"has such a thing befallen my state. Next\n      year I will certainly buy a little cannon.\" He looked at me imploringly.",
                "\"Is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen?\" said I, for a\n      light was beginning to break upon me.",
                "\"He worships his own god,\" said the prime minister. \"We can but starve him\n      out.\"",
                "\"Let the white man approach,\" said Namgay Doola from within. \"All others I\n      will kill. Send me the white man.\"",
                "The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan\n      hut crammed with children. And every child had flaming red hair. A\n      freshgathered cow's tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces of\n      black velvet -- my black velvet -- rudely hacked into the semblance\n      of masks.",
                "\"And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?\" I asked.",
                "He grinned more charmingly than ever. \"There is no shame,\" said he. \"I did\n      but cut off the tail of that man's cow. He betrayed me. I was minded to\n      shoot him, sahib, but not to death. Indeed, not to death; only in the\n      legs.\"",
                "\"And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king? Why at\n      all?\"",
                "\"By the god of my father, I cannot tell,\" said Namgay Doola.",
                "\"And who was thy father?\"",
                "\"The same that had this gun.\" He showed me his weapon, a Tower musket,\n      bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honorable East India Company.",
                "\"And thy father's name?\" said I.",
                "He obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came.\n      \"Thimla Dhula!\" said he, excitedly. \"To this hour I worship his god.\"",
                "\"May I see that god?\"",
                "\"In a little while -- at twilight time.\"",
                "\"Rememberest thou aught of thy father's speech?\"",
                "\"It is long ago. But there was one word which he said often. Thus,\n      ''Shun!' Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to our\n      sides, thus.\"",
                "\"Even so. And what was thy mother?\"",
                "\"A woman of the Hills. We be Lepchas of Darjiling, but me they call an\n      outlander because my hair is as thou seest.\"",
                "The Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long\n      parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close upon\n      twilight -- the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly the red-headed brats\n      rose from the floor and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid his gun\n      aside, lighted a little oil-lamp, and set it before a recess in the wall.\n      Pulling back a wisp of dirty cloth, he revealed a worn brass crucifix\n      leaning against the helmet badge of a long-forgotten East India Company's\n      regiment. \"Thus did my father,\" he said, crossing himself clumsily. The\n      wife and children followed suit. Then, all together, they struck up the\n      wailing cham that I heard on the hillside:",
                "\"Dir bane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee.\"",
                "I was puzzled no longer. Again and again they sung, as if their hearts\n      would break, their version of the chorus of \"The Wearing of the Green\":",
                "\"They're hanging men and women, too,\n     For the wearing of the green,\"",
                "A diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about eight\n      years old -- could he have been in the fields last night? -- was\n      watching me as he sung. I pulled out a rupee, held the coin between finger\n      and thumb, and looked -- only looked -- at the gun leaning against\n      the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread his\n      porringer-like face. Never for an instant stopping the song, he held out\n      his hand for the money, and then slid the gun to my hand. I might have\n      shot Namgay Doola dead as he chanted, but I was satisfied. The inevitable\n      blood-instinct held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain across the recess.\n      Angelus was over.",
                "\"Thus my father sung. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and I do\n      not know the purport of even these words, but it may be that the god will\n      understand. I am not of this people, and I will not pay revenue.\"",
                "\"And why?\"",
                "Again that soul-compelling grin. \"What occupation would be to me between\n      crop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. But these people do not\n      understand.\"",
                "He picked the masks off the floor and looked in my face as simply as a\n      child.",
                "\"By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make those deviltries?\" I\n      said, pointing.",
                "\"I cannot tell. I am but a Lepcha of Darjiling, and yet the stuff\" --",
                "\"Which thou hast stolen,\" said I.",
                "\"Nay, surely. Did I steal? I desired it so. The stuff -- the stuff.\n      What else should I have done with the stuff?\" He twisted the velvet\n      between his fingers.",
                "\"But the sin of maiming the cow -- consider that.\"",
                "\"Oh, sahib, the man betrayed me; the heifer's tail waved in the moonlight,\n      and I had my knife. What else should I have done? The tail came off ere I\n      was aware. Sahib, thou knowest more than I.\"",
                "\"That is true,\" said I. \"Stay within the door. I go to speak to the king.\"\n       The population of the state were ranged on the hillside. I went forth and\n      spoke.",

                "\"Nay,\" said the king. \"Why should I hurt the little children?\"",
                "They had poured out of the hut and were making plump obeisances to\n      everybody. Namgay Doola waited at the door with his gun across his arm.",
                "\"Or thou canst, discarding their impiety of the cow-maiming, raise him to\n      honor in thy army. He comes of a race that will not pay revenue.

Give him honor as may befall and\n      full allowance of work, but look to it, oh, king, that neither he nor his\n      hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward. Feed him with words and\n      favor, and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of, and he\n      will be a bulwark of defense. But deny him even a tuftlet of grass for his\n      own. This is the nature that God has given him. Moreover, he has brethren\" --",
                "The state groaned unanimously.",
                "\"But if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till they\n      die; or else the one will always give information concerning the other.\n      Shall he be of thy army, oh, king? Choose!\"",
                "The king bowed his head, and I said:",
                "\"Come forth, Namgay Doola, and command the king's army. Thy name shall no\n      more be Namgay in the mouths of men, but Patsay Doola, for, as thou hast\n      truly said, I know.\"",
                "Then Namgay Doola, never christened Patsay Doola, son of Timlay Doola -- which\n      is Tim Doolan -- clasped the king's feet, cuffed the standing army, and\n      hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to temple making offerings\n      for the sin of the cattle -- maiming.",
                "And the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to sell\n      me a village for 20 pounds sterling. But I buy no village in the Himalayas\n      so long as one red head flares between the tail of the heaven-climbing\n      glacier and the dark birch forest.",

                "THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY",
                "Imray had achieved the impossible. Without warning, for no conceivable\n      motive, in his youth and at the threshold of his career he had chosen to\n      disappear from the world -- which is to say, the little Indian station\n      where he lived. Upon a day he was alive, well, happy, and in great\n      evidence at his club, among the billiard-tables. Upon a morning he was\n      not, and no manner of search could make sure where he might be. He had\n      stepped out of his place; he had not appeared at his office at the proper\n      time, and his dog-cart was not upon the public roads. For these reasons\n      and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the administration\n      of the Indian Empire, the Indian Empire paused for one microscopical\n      moment to make inquiry into the fate of Imray. Ponds were dragged, wells\n      were plumbed, telegrams were dispatched down the lines of railways and to\n      the nearest seaport town -- 1,200 miles away -- but Imray was not at\n      the end of the drag-ropes nor the telegrams. He was gone, and his place\n      knew him no more. Then the work of the great Indian Empire swept forward,\n      because it could not be delayed, and Imray, from being a man, became a\n      mystery -- such a thing as men talk over at their tables in the club\n      for a month and then forget utterly. His guns, horses, and carts were sold\n      to the highest bidder. His superior officer wrote an absurd letter to his\n      mother, saying that Imray had unaccountably disappeared and his bungalow\n      stood empty on the road.",
                "After three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by, my\n      friend Strickland, of the police force, saw fit to rent the bungalow from\n      the native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal -- an\n      affair which has been described in another place -- and while he was\n      pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was\n      sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs.\n      There was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for\n      meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find on\n      the sideboard, and this is not good for the insides of human beings. His\n      domestic equipment was limited to six rifles, three shotguns, five\n      saddles, and a collection of stiff-jointed masheer rods, bigger and\n      stronger than the largest salmon rods. These things occupied one half of\n      his bungalow, and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog\n      Tietjens -- an enormous Rampur slut, who sung when she was ordered, and\n      devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke to Strickland in a\n      language of her own, and whenever, in her walks abroad she saw things\n      calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the Queen Empress, she\n      returned to her master and gave him information. Strickland would take\n      steps at once, and the end of his labors was trouble and fine and\n      imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was a\n      familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born of\n      hate and fear One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use.\n      She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking-trough, and if any one\n      came into Strickland's room at night, her custom was to knock down the\n      invader and give tongue till some one came with a light. Strickland owes\n      his life to her. When he was on the frontier in search of the local\n      murderer who came in the grey dawn to send Strickland much further than\n      the Andaman Islands, Tietjens caught him as he was crawling into\n      Strickland's tent with a dagger between his teeth, and after his record of\n      iniquity was established in the eyes of the law, he was hanged. From that\n      date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a monogram on her\n      night blanket, and the blanket was double-woven Kashmir cloth, for she was\n      a delicate dog.",
                "Under no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland, and when he\n      was ill with fever she made great trouble for the doctors because she did\n      not know how to help her master and would not allow another creature to\n      attempt aid. Macarnaght, of the Indian Medical Service, beat her over the\n      head with a gun, before she could understand that she must give room for\n      those who could give quinine.",
                "A short time after Strickland had taken Imray's bungalow, my business took\n      me through that station, and naturally, the club quarters being full, I\n      quartered myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow,\n      eight-roomed, and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from\n      rain. Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling cloth, which looked just\n      as nice as a whitewashed ceiling. The landlord had repainted it when\n      Strickland took the bungalow, and unless you knew how Indian bungalows\n      were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the\n      dark, three-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and the under\n      side of the thatch harbored all manner of rats, hats, ants, and other\n      things.",
                "Tietjens met me in the veranda with a bay like the boom of the bells of\n      St. Paul's, and put her paws on my shoulders and said she was glad to see\n      me. Strickland had contrived to put together that sort of meal which he\n      called lunch, and immediately after it was finished went out about his\n      business. I was left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs. The heat of\n      the summer had broken up and given place to the warm damp of the rains.\n      There was no motion in the heated air, but the rain fell like bayonet rods\n      on the earth, and flung up a blue mist where it splashed back again. The\n      bamboos and the custard apples, the poinsettias and the mango-trees in the\n      garden stood still while the warm water lashed through them, and the frogs\n      began to sing among the aloe hedges. A little before the light failed, and\n      when the rain was at its worst, I sat in the back veranda and heard the\n      water roar from the eaves, and scratched myself because I was covered with\n      the thing they called prickly heat. Tietjens came out with me and put her\n      head in my lap, and was very sorrowful, so I gave her biscuits when tea\n      was ready, and I took tea in the back veranda on account of the little\n      coolness I found there. The rooms of the house were dark behind me. I\n      could smell Strickland's saddlery and the oil on his guns, and I did not\n      the least desire to sit among these things. My own servant came to me in\n      the twilight, the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched\n      body, and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some one.\n      Very much against my will, and because of the darkness of the rooms, I\n      went into the naked drawing-room, telling my man to bring the lights.\n      There might or might not have been a caller in the room -- it seems to\n      me that I saw a figure by one of the windows, but when the lights came\n      there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without and the smell of the\n      drinking earth in my nostrils. I explained to my man that he was no wiser\n      than he ought to be, and went back to the veranda to talk to Tietjens. She\n      had gone out into the wet and I could hardly coax her back to me -- even\n      with biscuits with sugar on top. Strickland rode back, dripping wet, just\n      before dinner, and the first thing he said was:",
                "\"Has any one called?\"",
                "I explained, with apologies, that my servant had called me into the\n      drawing-room on a false alarm; or that some loafer had tried to call on\n      Strickland, and, thinking better of it, fled after giving his name.\n      Strickland ordered dinner without comment, and since it was a real dinner,\n      with white tablecloth attached, we sat down.",
                "At nine o'clock Strickland wanted to go to bed, and I was tired too.\n      Tietjens, who had been lying underneath the table, rose up and went into\n      the least exposed veranda as soon as her master moved to his own room,\n      which was next to the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens. If a mere\n      wife had wished to sleep out-of-doors in that pelting rain, it would not\n      have mattered, but Tietjens was a dog, and therefore the better animal. I\n      looked at Strickland, expecting to see him flog her with a whip. He smiled\n      queerly, as a man would smile after telling some hideous domestic tragedy.\n      \"She has done this ever since I moved in here.\"",
                "The dog was Strickland's dog, so I said nothing, but I felt all that\n      Strickland felt in being made light of. Tietjens encamped outside my\n      bedroom window, and storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch,\n      and died away. The lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spattered a\n      barn door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and looking through my\n      slit bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog standing, not sleeping, in\n      the veranda, the hackles alift on her back, and her feet planted as\n      tensely as the drawn wire rope of a suspension bridge. In the very short\n      pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but it seemed that some one wanted\n      me very badly. He, whoever he was, was trying to call me by name, but his\n      voice was no more than a husky whisper. Then the thunder ceased and\n      Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon. Somebody tried\n      to open my door, and walked about and through the house, and stood\n      breathing heavily in the verandas, and just when I was falling asleep I\n      fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamoring above my head or on\n      the door.",
                "I ran into Strickland's room and asked him whether he was ill and had been\n      calling for me. He was lying on the bed half-dressed, with a pipe in his\n      mouth. \"I thought you'd come,\" he said. \"Have I been walking around the\n      house at all?\"",
                "I explained that he had been in the dining-room and the smoking-room and\n      two or three other places; and he laughed and told me to go back to bed. I\n      went back to bed and slept till the morning, but in all my dreams I was\n      sure I was doing some one an injustice in not attending to his wants. What\n      those wants were I could not tell, but a fluttering, whispering,\n      bolt-fumbling, luring, loitering some one was reproaching me for my\n      slackness, and through all the dreams I heard the howling of Tietjens in\n      the garden and the thrashing of the rain.",
                "I was in that house for two days, and Strickland went to his office daily,\n      leaving me alone for eight or ten hours a day, with Tietjens for my only\n      companion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable, and so was\n      Tietjens; but in the twilight she and I moved into the back veranda and\n      cuddled each other for company. We were alone in the house, but for all\n      that it was fully occupied by a tenant with whom I had no desire to\n      interfere. I never saw him, but I could see the curtains between the rooms\n      quivering where he had just passed through; I could hear the chairs\n      creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had just quitted them;\n      and I could feel when I went to get a book from the dining-room that\n      somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front veranda till I should\n      have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more interesting by glaring\n      into the darkened rooms, with every hair erect, and following the motions\n      of something that I could not see. She never entered the rooms, but her\n      eyes moved, and that was quite sufficient. Only when my servant came to\n      trim the lamps and make all light and habitable, she would come in with me\n      and spend her time sitting on her haunches watching an invisible extra man\n      as he moved about behind my shoulder. Dogs are cheerful companions.",
                "I explained to Strickland, gently as might be, that I would go over to the\n      club and find for myself quarters there. I admired his hospitality, was\n      pleased with his guns and rods, but I did not much care for his house and\n      its atmosphere. He heard me out to the end, and then smiled very wearily,\n      but without contempt, for he is a man who understands things. \"Stay on,\"\n       he said, \"and see what this thing means. All you have talked about I have\n      known since I took the bungalow. Stay on and wait. Tietjens has left me.\n      Are you going too?\"",
                "I had seen him through one little affair connected with an idol that had\n      brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and I had no desire to help\n      him through further experiences. He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses\n      arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.",
                "Therefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely,\n      and would be happy to see him in the daytime, but that I didn't care to\n      sleep under his roof. This was after dinner, when Tietjens had gone out to\n      lie in the veranda.",
                "\"'Pon my soul, I don't wonder,\" said Strickland, with his eyes on the\n      ceiling-cloth. \"Look at that.\"",
                "The tails of two snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice of\n      the wall. They threw long shadows in the lamp-light. \"If you are afraid of\n      snakes, of course\" -- said Strickland. \"I hate and fear snakes, because\n      if you look into the eyes of any snake you will see that it knows all and\n      more of man's fall, and that it feels all the contempt that the devil felt\n      when Adam was evicted from Eden. Besides which its bite is generally\n      fatal, and it bursts up trouser legs.\"",
                "\"You ought to get your thatch over-hauled,\" I said. \"Give me a masheer\n      rod, and we'll poke 'em down.\"",
                "\"They'll hide among the roof beams,\" said Strickland. \"I can't stand\n      snakes overhead. I'm going up. If I shake 'em down, stand by with a\n      cleaning-rod and break their backs.\"",
                "I was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work, but I took the\n      loading-rod and waited in the dining-room, while Strickland brought a\n      gardener's ladder from the veranda and set it against the side of the\n      room. The snake tails drew themselves up and disappeared. We could hear\n      the dry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy cloth.\n      Strickland took a lamp with him, while I tried to make clear the danger of\n      hunting roof snakes between a ceiling cloth and a thatch, apart from the\n      deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceiling-cloths.",
                "\"N o n s en s e,\" said Strickland. \"They're sure to hide near the walls by\n      the cloth. The bricks are too cold for 'em, and the heat of the room is\n      just what they like.\" He put his hands to the corner of the cloth and\n      ripped the rotten stuff from the cornice. It gave great sound of tearing,\n      and Strickland put his head through the opening into the dark of the angle\n      of the roof beams. I set my teeth and lifted the loading-rod, for I had\n      not the least knowledge of what might descend.",
                "\"H'm,\" said Strickland; and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof.\n      \"There's room for another set of rooms up here, and, by Jove! some one is\n      occupying em.\"",
                "\"Snakes?\" I said down below.",
                "\"No. It's a buffalo. Hand me up the two first joints of a masheer rod, and\n      I'll prod it. It's lying on the main beam.\"",
                "I handed up the rod.",
                "\"What a nest for owls and serpents! No wonder the snakes live here,\" said\n      Strickland, climbing further into the roof. I could see his elbow\n      thrusting with the rod. \"Come out of that, whoever you are! Look out!\n      Heads below there! It's tottering.\"",
                "I saw the ceiling-cloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a shape\n      that was pressing it downward and downward toward the lighted lamps on the\n      table. I snatched a lamp out of danger and stood back. Then the cloth\n      ripped out from the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot down upon the\n      table something that I dared not look at till Strickland had slid down the\n      ladder and was standing by my side.",
                "He did not say much, being a man of few words, but he picked up the loose\n      end of the table-cloth and threw it over the thing on the table.",
                "\"It strikes me,\" said he, pulling down the lamp, \"our friend Imray has\n      come back. Oh! you would, would you?\"",
                "There was a movement under the cloth, and a little snake wriggled out, to\n      be back-broken by the butt of the masheer rod. I was sufficiently sick to\n      make no remarks worth recording.",
                "Strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks liberally. The thing\n      under the cloth made no more signs of life.",
                "\"Is it Imray?\" I said.",
                "Strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked. \"It is Imray,\"\n       he said, \"and his throat is cut from ear to ear.\"",
                "Then we spoke both together and to ourselves:",
                "\"That's why he whispered about the house.\"",
                "Tietjens, in the garden, began to bay furiously. A little later her great\n      nose heaved upon the dining-room door.",
                "She sniffed and was still. The broken and tattered ceiling-cloth hung down\n      almost to the level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away\n      from the discovery.",
                "Then Tietjens came in and sat down, her teeth bared and her forepaws\n      planted. She looked at Strickland.",
                "\"It's bad business, old lady,\" said he. \"Men don't go up into the roofs of\n      their bungalows to die, and they don't fasten up the ceiling-cloth behind\n      'em. Let's think it out.\"",
                "\"Let's think it out somewhere else,\" I said.",
                "\"Excellent idea! Turn the lamps out. We'll get into my room.\"",
                "I did not turn the lamps out. I went into Strickland's room first and\n      allowed him to make the darkness. Then he followed me, and we lighted\n      tobacco and thought. Strickland did the thinking. I smoked furiously\n      because I was afraid.",
                "\"Imray is back,\" said Strickland. \"The question is, who killed Imray?\n      Don't talk -- I have a notion of my own. When I took this bungalow I\n      took most of Imray's servants. Imray was guileless and inoffensive, wasn't\n      he?\"",
                "I agreed, though the heap under the cloth looked neither one thing nor the\n      other.",
                "\"If I call the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like\n      Aryans. What do you suggest?\"",
                "\"Call 'em in one by one,\" I said.",
                "\"They'll run away and give the news to all their fellows,\" said\n      Strickland.",
                "\"We must segregate 'em. Do you suppose your servant knows anything about\n      it?\"",
                "\"He may, for aught I know, but I don't think it's likely. He has only been\n      here two or three days.\"",
                "\"What's your notion?\" I asked.",
                "\"I can't quite tell. How the dickens did the man get the wrong side of the\n      ceiling-cloth?\"",
                "There was a heavy coughing outside Strickland's bedroom door. This showed\n      that Bahadur Khan, his body-servant, had waked from sleep and wished to\n      put Strickland to bed.",
                "\"Come in,\" said Strickland. \"It is a very warm night, isn't it?\"",
                "Bahadur Khan, a great, green-turbaned, six-foot Mohammedan, said that it\n      was a very warm night, but that there was more rain pending, which, by his\n      honor's favor, would bring relief to the country.",
                "\"It will be so, if God pleases,\" said Strickland, tugging off his hoots.\n      \"It is in my mind, Bahadur Khan, that I have worked thee remorselessly for\n      many days -- ever since that time when thou first came into my service.\n      What time was that?\"",
                "\"Has the heaven-born forgotten? It was when Imray Sahib went secretly to\n      Europe without warning given, and I -- even I -- came into the\n      honored service of the protector of the poor.\"",
                "\"And Imray Sahib went to Europe?\"",
                "\"It is so said among the servants.\"",
                "\"And thou wilt take service with him when he returns?\"",
                "\"Assuredly, sahib. He was a good master and cherished his dependents.\"",
                "\"That is true. I am very tired, but I can go buck-shooting tomorrow. Give\n      me the little rifle that I use for black buck; it is in the case yonder.\"",
                "The man stooped over the case, banded barrels, stock, and fore-end to\n      Strickland, who fitted them together. Yawning dolefully, then he reached\n      down to the gun-case, took a solid drawn cartridge, and slipped it into\n      the breech of the .360 express.",
                "\"And Imray Sahib has gone to Europe secretly? That is very strange,\n      Bahadur Khan, is it not?\"",
                "\"What do I know of the ways of the white man, heaven-born?\"",
                "\"Very little, truly. But thou shalt know more. It has reached me that\n      Imray Sahib has returned from his so long journeyings, and that even now\n      he lies in the next room, waiting his servant.\"",
                "\"Sahib!\"",
                "The lamp-light slid along the barrels of the rifle as they leveled\n      themselves against Bahadur Khan's broad breast.",
                "\"Go, then, and look!\" said Strickland. \"Take a lamp. Thy master is tired,\n      and he waits. Go!\"",
                "The man picked up a lamp and went into the dining-room, Strickland\n      following, and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle. He looked\n      for a moment at the black depths behind the ceiling-cloth, at the carcass\n      of the mangled snake under foot, and last, a grey glaze setting on his\n      face, at the thing under the table-cloth.",
                "\"Hast thou seen?\" said Strickland, after a pause.",
                "\"I have seen. I am clay in the white man's hands. What does the presence\n      do?\"",
                "\"Hang thee within a month! What else?\"",
                "\"For killing him? Nay, sahib, consider. Walking among us, his servants, he\n      cast his eyes upon my child, who was four years old. Him he bewitched, and\n      in ten days he died of the fever. My child!\"",
                "\"What said Imray Sahib?\"",
                "\"He said he was a handsome child, and patted him on the head; wherefore my\n      child died. Wherefore I killed Imray Sahib in the twilight, when he came\n      back from office and was sleeping. The heaven-born knows all things. I am\n      the servant of the heaven-born.\"",

                "MOTI GUJ -- MUTINEER",
                "ONCE upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who wished to clear\n      some forest land for coffee-planting. When he had cut down all the trees\n      and burned the underwood, the stumps still remained. Dynamite is expensive\n      and slow fire slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing is the lord of all\n      beasts, who is the elephant. He will either push the stump out of the\n      ground with his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with ropes. The\n      planter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and threes, and fell\n      to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of\n      all the drivers or mahouts; and this superior beast's name was Moti Guj.\n      He was the absolute property of his mahout, which would never have been\n      the case under native rule; for Moti Guj was a creature to be desired by\n      kings, and his name, being translated, meant the Pearl Elephant. Because\n      the British government was in the land, Deesa, the mahout, enjoyed his\n      property undisturbed. He was dissipated. When he had made much money\n      through the strength of his elephant, he would get extremely drunk and\n      give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg over the tender nails of the\n      forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled the life out of Deesa on these\n      occasions, for he knew that after the beating was over, Deesa would\n      embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and his life and the\n      liver of his soul, and give him some liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of\n      liquor -- arrack for choice, though he would drink palm-tree toddy if\n      nothing better offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep between Moti Guj's\n      forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of the public road, and\n      as Moti Guj mounted guard over him, and would not permit horse, foot, or\n      cart to pass by, traffic was congested till Deesa saw fit to wake up.",
                "There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter's clearing: the wages\n      were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj's neck and gave him orders,\n      while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps -- for he owned a magnificent pair\n      of tusks; or pulled at the end of a rope -- for he had a magnificent\n      pair of shoulders -- while Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he\n      was the king of elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his\n      three hundred pounds' weight of green food with a quart of arrack, and\n      Deesa would take a share, and sing songs between Moti Guj's legs till it\n      was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river,\n      and Moti Gui lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows, while Deesa went\n      over him with a coir swab and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook the pounding\n      blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up\n      and turn over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his feet and\n      examine his eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of\n      sores or budding ophthalmia. After inspection the two would come up with a\n      song from the sea, Moti Guj, all black and shining, waving a torn tree\n      branch twelve feet long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his own long\n      wet hair.",
                "It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the desire\n      to drink deep. He wished for an orgy. The little draughts that led nowhere\n      were taking the manhood out of him.",
                "He went to the planter, and \"My mother's dead,\" said he, weeping.",
                "\"She died on the last plantation two months ago, and she died once before\n      that when you were working for me last year,\" said the planter, who knew\n      something of the ways of nativedom.",
                "\"Then it's my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to me,\" said\n      Deesa, weeping more than ever. \"She has left eighteen small children\n      entirely without bread, and it is I who must fill their little stomachs,\"\n       said Deesa, beating his head on the floor.",
                "\"Who brought the news?\" said the planter.",
                "\"The post,\" said Deesa.",
                "\"There hasn't been a post here for the past week. Get back to your\n      lines!\",",
                "\"A devastating sickness has fallen on my village, and all my wives are\n      dying,\" yelled Deesa, really in tears this time.",
                "\"Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa's village,\" said the planter. \"Chihun,\n      has this man got a wife?\"",
                "\"He?\" said Chihun. \"No. Not a woman of our village would look at him.\n      They'd sooner marry the elephant!\"",
                "Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and bellowed.",
                "\"You will get into a difficulty in a minute,\" said the planter. \"Go back\n      to your work!\"",
                "\"Now I will speak Heaven's truth,\" gulped Deesa, with an inspiration. \"I\n      haven't been drunk for two months. I desire to depart in order to get\n      properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation. Thus I\n      shall cause no trouble.\"",
                "A flickering smile crossed the planter's face. \"Deesa,\" said he, \"you've\n      spoken the truth, and I'd give you leave on the spot if anything could be\n      done with Moti Guj while you're away. You know that he will only obey your\n      orders.\"",
                "\"May the light of the heavens live forty thousand years. I shall be absent\n      but ten little days. After that, upon my faith and honor and soul, I\n      return. As to the inconsiderable interval, have I the gracious permission\n      of the heaven-born to call up Moti Guj?\"",
                "Permission was granted, and in answer of Deesa's shrill yell, the mighty\n      tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been\n      squirting dust over himself till his master should return.",
                "\"Light of my heart, protector of the drunken, mountain of might, give\n      ear!\" said Deesa, standing in front of him.",
                "Moti Guj gave ear, and saluted with his trunk. \"I am going away,\" said\n      Deesa.",
                "Moti Guj's eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his master. One could\n      snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then.",
                "\"But you, you fussy old pig, must stay behind and work.\"",
                "The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He hated\n      stump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.",
                "\"I shall be gone for ten days, oh, delectable one! Hold up your near\n      forefoot and I'll impress the fact upon it, warty toad of a dried\n      mud-puddle.\" Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti Guj ten times on the\n      nails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.",
                "\"Ten days,\" said Deesa, \"you will work and haul and root the trees as\n      Chihun here shall order you. Take up Chihun and set him on your neck!\"\n       Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk, Chihun put his foot there, and was\n      swung on to the neck. Deesa handed Chihun the heavy ankus -- the iron\n      elephant goad.",
                "Chihun thumped Moti Guj's bald head as a paver thumps a curbstone.",
                "Moti Guj trumpeted.",
                "\"Be still, hog of the backwoods! Chihun's your mahout for ten days. And\n      now bid me goodbye, beast after mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my king!\n      Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the herd, preserve your honored\n      health; be virtuous. Adieu!\"",
                "Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air twice.\n      That was his way of bidding him goodbye.",
                "\"He'll work now,\" said Deesa to the planter. \"Have I leave to go?\"",
                "The planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti Guj went back to\n      haul stumps.",
                "Chihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn for all that.\n      Chihun gave him a ball of spices, and tickled him under the chin, and\n      Chihun's little baby cooed to him after work was over, and Chihun's wife\n      called him a darling; but Moti Guj was a bachelor by instinct, as Deesa\n      was. He did not understand the domestic emotions. He wanted the light of\n      his universe back again -- the drink and the drunken slumber, the\n      savage beatings and the savage caresses.",
                "None the less he worked well, and the planter wondered. Deesa had wandered\n      along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own caste, and,\n      drinking, dancing, and tippling, had drifted with it past all knowledge of\n      the lapse of time.",
                "The morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned no Deesa, Moti\n      Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint. He swung clear, looked\n      round, shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away, as one having\n      business elsewhere.",
                "\"Hi! ho! Come back you!\" shouted Chihun. \"Come back and put me on your\n      neck, misborn mountain! Return, splendor of the hillsides! Adornment of\n      all India, heave to, or I'll bang every toe off your forefoot!\"",
                "Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after him with a\n      rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward, and Chihun knew\n      what that meant, though he tried to carry it off with high words.",
                "\"None of your nonsense with me,\" said he. \"To your pickets, devil-son!\"",
                "\"Hrrump!\" said Moti Guj, and that was all -- that and the forebent\n      ears.",
                "Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for a toothpick,\n      and strolled about the clearing, making fun of the other elephants who had\n      just set to work.",
                "Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came out with a\n      dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid the white man the\n      compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing\n      and \"Hrrumphing\" him into his veranda. Then he stood outside the house,\n      chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it, as an\n      elephant will.",
                "\"We'll thrash him,\" said the planter. \"He shall have the finest thrashing\n      ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve foot of chain\n      apiece, and tell them to lay on twenty.\"",
                "Kala Nag -- which means Black Snake -- and Nazim were two of the\n      biggest elephants in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer\n      the graver punishment, since no man can beat an elephant properly.",
                "They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as they\n      sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti Guj had\n      never, in all his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped, and he did not\n      intend to begin a new experience. So he waited, waving his head from right\n      to left, and measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag's fat side where a\n      blunt tusk could sink deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain was the\n      badge of his authority; but for all that, he swung wide of Moti Guj at the\n      last minute, and tried to appear as if he had brought the chain out for\n      amusement. Nazim turned round and went home early. He did not feel\n      fighting fit that morning, and so Moti Guj was left standing alone with\n      his ears cocked.",
                "That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back to his\n      amateur inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work and is\n      not tied up is about as manageable as an eighty-one-ton gun loose in a\n      heavy seaway. He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the\n      stumps were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning labor and\n      the inalienable rights of elephants to a long 'nooning'; and, wandering to\n      and fro, he thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown, when he\n      returned to his picket for food.",
                "\"If you won't work, you sha'n't eat,\" said Chihun, angrily. \"You're a wild\n      elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your jungle.\"",
                "Chihun's little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut, and\n      stretching out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj\n      knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out\n      his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw\n      itself, shouting, upon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown\n      baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his father's head.",
                "\"Great Lord!\" said Chihun. \"Flour cakes of the best, twelve in number, two\n      feet across and soaked in rum, shall be yours on the instant, and two\n      hundred pounds weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane therewith. Deign only\n      to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to\n      me!\"",
                "Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet, that\n      could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun's hut, and waited for his\n      food. He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed and\n      thought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is\n      that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives. Four or\n      five hours in the night suffice -- two just before midnight, lying down\n      on one side; two just after one o'clock, lying down on the other. The rest\n      of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting, and long\n      grumbling soliloquies.",
                "At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a thought\n      had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark\n      forest with none to look after him. So all that night he chased through\n      the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears. He went down\n      to the river and blared across the shallows where Deesa used to wash him,\n      but there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he disturbed all the\n      other elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to death some gypsies\n      in the woods.",
                "At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk in deed,\n      and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying his leave. He drew a\n      long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still\n      uninjured, for he knew something of Moti Guj's temper, and reported\n      himself with many lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for\n      breakfast. The night exercise had made him hungry.",
                "\"Call up your beast,\" said the planter; and Deesa shouted in the\n      mysterious elephant language that some mahouts believe came from China at\n      the birth of the world, when elephants and not men were masters. Moti Guj\n      heard and came. Elephants do not gallop They move from places at varying\n      rates of speed. If an elephant wished to catch an express train he could\n      not gallop, but he could catch the train. So Moti Guj was at the planter's\n      door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his pickets. He fell\n      into Deesa's arms trumpeting with joy, and the man and beast wept and\n      slobbered over each other, and handled each other from head to heel to see\n      that no harm had befallen.",
                "\"Now we will get to work,\" said Deesa. \"Lift me up, my son and my joy!\"",
                "Moti Guj swung him up, and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look for\n      difficult stumps.",
                "The planter was too astonished to be very angry."
