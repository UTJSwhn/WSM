                "CHAPTER I",
                "THE towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist; austere towers of\n      steel and cement and limestone, sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver\n      rods. They were neither citadels nor churches, but frankly and beautifully\n      office-buildings.",
                "The mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations: the\n      Post Office with its shingle-tortured mansard, the red brick minarets of\n      hulking old houses, factories with stingy and sooted windows, wooden\n      tenements colored like mud. The city was full of such grotesqueries, but\n      the clean towers were thrusting them from the business center, and on the\n      farther hills were shining new houses, homes -- they seemed -- for\n      laughter and tranquillity.",
                "Over a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless\n      engine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night\n      rehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably\n      illuminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of\n      green and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty lines\n      of polished steel leaped into the glare.",
                "In one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing\n      down. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades\n      after a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building\n      crawled the scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist\n      spun away. Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of\n      new factories, sheets of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where\n      five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares\n      that would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles\n      rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of\n      labor in a city built -- it seemed -- for giants.",
                "II",
                "There was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was beginning\n      to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in that\n      residential district of Zenith known as Floral Heights.",
                "His name was George F. Babbitt. He was forty-six years old now, in April,\n      1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes nor\n      poetry, but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than\n      people could afford to pay.",
                "His large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. His face was babyish\n      in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on the slopes\n      of his nose. He was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed; his cheeks\n      were pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon the\n      khaki-colored blanket was slightly puffy. He seemed prosperous, extremely\n      married and unromantic; and altogether unromantic appeared this\n      sleeping-porch, which looked on one sizable elm, two respectable\n      grass-plots, a cement driveway, and a corrugated iron garage. Yet Babbitt\n      was again dreaming of the fairy child, a dream more romantic than scarlet\n      pagodas by a silver sea.",
                "For years the fairy child had come to him. Where others saw but Georgie\n      Babbitt, she discerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the darkness\n      beyond mysterious groves. When at last he could slip away from the crowded\n      house he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring friends, sought to follow,\n      but he escaped, the girl fleet beside him, and they crouched together on a\n      shadowy hillside. She was so slim, so white, so eager! She cried that he\n      was gay and valiant, that she would wait for him, that they would sail --",
                "Rumble and bang of the milk-truck.",
                "Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled back toward his dream. He could see\n      only her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the\n      basement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully\n      into a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the\n      rolled-up Advocate thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach\n      constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and\n      irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah,\n      snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen\n      driver, with him waited through taut hours for the roar of the starting\n      engine, with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal\n      patient snap-ah-ah -- a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning\n      sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of\n      the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he released from the\n      panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against\n      the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had\n      been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the\n      possible and improbable adventures of each new day.",
                "He escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at seven-twenty.",
                "III",
                "It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced\n      alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime,\n      intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being\n      awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as\n      buying expensive cord tires.",
                "He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and\n      detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family,\n      and disliked himself for disliking them. The evening before, he had played\n      poker at Vergil Gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays he was\n      irritable before breakfast. It may have been the tremendous home-brewed\n      beer of the prohibition-era and the cigars to which that beer enticed him;\n      it may have been resentment of return from this fine, bold man-world to a\n      restricted region of wives and stenographers, and of suggestions not to\n      smoke so much.",
                "From the bedroom beside the sleeping-porch, his wife's detestably cheerful\n      \"Time to get up, Georgie boy,\" and the itchy sound, the brisk and scratchy\n      sound, of combing hairs out of a stiff brush.",
                "He grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in faded baby-blue pajamas, from\n      under the khaki blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running his\n      fingers through his wild hair, while his plump feet mechanically felt for\n      his slippers. He looked regretfully at the blanket -- forever a\n      suggestion to him of freedom and heroism. He had bought it for a camping\n      trip which had never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loafing, gorgeous\n      cursing, virile flannel shirts.",
                "He creaked to his feet, groaning at the waves of pain which passed behind\n      his eyeballs. Though he waited for their scorching recurrence, he looked\n      blurrily out at the yard. It delighted him, as always; it was the neat\n      yard of a successful business man of Zenith, that is, it was perfection,\n      and made him also perfect. He regarded the corrugated iron garage. For the\n      three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he reflected, \"No class to\n      that tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage. But by golly it's the\n      only thing on the place that isn't up-to-date!\" While he stared he thought\n      of a community garage for his acreage development, Glen Oriole. He stopped\n      puffing and jiggling. His arms were akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen\n      face was set in harder lines. He suddenly seemed capable, an official, a\n      man to contrive, to direct, to get things done.",
                "On the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, clean,\n      unused-looking hall into the bathroom.",
                "Though the house was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights,\n      an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek\n      as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub\n      was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a\n      sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder,\n      soap-dish, sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so\n      ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board. But the\n      Babbitt whose god was Modern Appliances was not pleased. The air of the\n      bathroom was thick with the smell of a heathen toothpaste. \"Verona been at\n      it again! 'Stead of sticking to Lilidol, like I've re-peat-ed-ly asked\n      her, she's gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that makes you\n      sick!\"",
                "The bath-mat was wrinkled and the floor was wet. (His daughter Verona\n      eccentrically took baths in the morning, now and then.) He slipped on the\n      mat, and slid against the tub. He said \"Damn!\" Furiously he snatched up\n      his tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent\n      slapping of the unctuous brush, furiously he raked his plump cheeks with a\n      safety-razor. It pulled. The blade was dull. He said, \"Damn -- oh -- oh -- damn\n      it!\"",
                "He hunted through the medicine-cabinet for a packet of new razor-blades\n      (reflecting, as invariably, \"Be cheaper to buy one of these dinguses and\n      strop your own blades,\") and when he discovered the packet, behind the\n      round box of bicarbonate of soda, he thought ill of his wife for putting\n      it there and very well of himself for not saying \"Damn.\" But he did say\n      it, immediately afterward, when with wet and soap-slippery fingers he\n      tried to remove the horrible little envelope and crisp clinging oiled\n      paper from the new blade. Then there was the problem, oft-pondered, never\n      solved, of what to do with the old blade, which might imperil the fingers\n      of his young. As usual, he tossed it on top of the medicine-cabinet, with\n      a mental note that some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades\n      that were also temporarily, piled up there. He finished his shaving in a\n      growing testiness increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness\n      in his stomach. When he was done, his round face smooth and streamy and\n      his eyes stinging from soapy water, he reached for a towel. The family\n      towels were wet, wet and clammy and vile, all of them wet, he found, as he\n      blindly snatched them -- his own face-towel, his wife's, Verona's,\n      Ted's, Tinka's, and the lone bath-towel with the huge welt of initial.\n      Then George F. Babbitt did a dismaying thing. He wiped his face on the\n      guest-towel! It was a pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there to\n      indicate that the Babbitts were in the best Floral Heights society. No one\n      had ever used it. No guest had ever dared to. Guests secretively took a\n      corner of the nearest regular towel.",
                "He was raging, \"By golly, here they go and use up all the towels, every\n      doggone one of 'em, and they use 'em and get 'em all wet and sopping, and\n      never put out a dry one for me -- of course, I'm the goat! -- and\n      then I want one and -- I'm the only person in the doggone house that's\n      got the slightest doggone bit of consideration for other people and\n      thoughtfulness and consider there may be others that may want to use the\n      doggone bathroom after me and consider -- \"",
                "He was pitching the chill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by the\n      vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his wife\n      serenely trotted in, observed serenely, \"Why Georgie dear, what are you\n      doing? Are you going to wash out the towels? Why, you needn't wash out the\n      towels. Oh, Georgie, you didn't go and use the guest-towel, did you?\"",
                "It is not recorded that he was able to answer.",
                "For the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to look\n      at her.",
                "IV",
                "Myra Babbitt -- Mrs. George F. Babbitt -- was definitely mature. She\n      had creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and\n      her plump neck bagged. But the thing that marked her as having passed the\n      line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no\n      longer worried about not having reticences. She was in a petticoat now,\n      and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets. She\n      had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full\n      matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun. She was a good woman, a\n      kind woman, a diligent woman, but no one, save perhaps Tinka her\n      ten-year-old, was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she was\n      alive.",
                "After a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social aspects\n      of towels she apologized to Babbitt for his having an alcoholic headache;\n      and he recovered enough to endure the search for a B.V.D. undershirt which\n      had, he pointed out, malevolently been concealed among his clean pajamas.",
                "He was fairly amiable in the conference on the brown suit.",
                "\"What do you think, Myra?\" He pawed at the clothes hunched on a chair in\n      their bedroom, while she moved about mysteriously adjusting and patting\n      her petticoat and, to his jaundiced eye, never seeming to get on with her\n      dressing. \"How about it? Shall I wear the brown suit another day?\"",
                "\"Well, it looks awfully nice on you.\"",
                "\"I know, but gosh, it needs pressing.\"",
                "\"That's so. Perhaps it does.\"",
                "\"It certainly could stand being pressed, all right.\"",
                "\"Yes, perhaps it wouldn't hurt it to be pressed.\"",
                "\"But gee, the coat doesn't need pressing. No sense in having the whole\n      darn suit pressed, when the coat doesn't need it.\"",
                "\"That's so.\"",
                "\"But the pants certainly need it, all right. Look at them -- look at\n      those wrinkles -- the pants certainly do need pressing.\"",
                "\"That's so. Oh, Georgie, why couldn't you wear the brown coat with the\n      blue trousers we were wondering what we'd do with them?\"",
                "\"Good Lord! Did you ever in all my life know me to wear the coat of one\n      suit and the pants of another? What do you think I am? A busted\n      bookkeeper?\"",
                "\"Well, why don't you put on the dark gray suit to-day, and stop in at the\n      tailor and leave the brown trousers?\"",
                "\"Well, they certainly need -- Now where the devil is that gray suit?\n      Oh, yes, here we are.\"",
                "He was able to get through the other crises of dressing with comparative\n      resoluteness and calm.",
                "His first adornment was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, in which\n      he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a\n      civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of\n      Progress that he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments,\n      like his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second\n      embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a\n      tremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line.\n      But most wonder-working of all was the donning of his spectacles.",
                "There is character in spectacles -- the pretentious tortoiseshell, the\n      meek pince-nez of the school teacher, the twisted silver-framed glasses of\n      the old villager. Babbitt's spectacles had huge, circular, frameless\n      lenses of the very best glass; the ear-pieces were thin bars of gold. In\n      them he was the modern business man; one who gave orders to clerks and\n      drove a car and played occasional golf and was scholarly in regard to\n      Salesmanship. His head suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty, and you\n      noted his heavy, blunt nose, his straight mouth and thick, long upper lip,\n      his chin overfleshy but strong; with respect you beheld him put on the\n      rest of his uniform as a Solid Citizen.",
                "The gray suit was well cut, well made, and completely undistinguished. It\n      was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor of\n      law and learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots, honest\n      boots, standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The only\n      frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable comment on\n      the matter to Mrs. Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening the back of her\n      blouse to her skirt with a safety-pin, did not hear a word he said), he\n      chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown\n      harps among blown palms, and into it he thrust a snake-head pin with opal\n      eyes.",
                "A sensational event was changing from the brown suit to the gray the\n      contents of his pockets. He was earnest about these objects. They were of\n      eternal importance, like baseball or the Republican Party. They included a\n      fountain pen and a silver pencil (always lacking a supply of new leads)\n      which belonged in the righthand upper vest pocket. Without them he would\n      have felt naked. On his watch-chain were a gold penknife, silver\n      cigar-cutter, seven keys (the use of two of which he had forgotten), and\n      incidentally a good watch. Depending from the chain was a large, yellowish\n      elk's-tooth-proclamation of his membership in the Brotherly and Protective\n      Order of Elks. Most significant of all was his loose-leaf pocket\n      note-book, that modern and efficient note-book which contained the\n      addresses of people whom he had forgotten, prudent memoranda of postal\n      money-orders which had reached their destinations months ago, stamps which\n      had lost their mucilage, clippings of verses by T. Cholmondeley Frink and\n      of the newspaper editorials from which Babbitt got his opinions and his\n      polysyllables, notes to be sure and do things which he did not intend to\n      do, and one curious inscription -- D.S.S. D.M.Y.P.D.F.",
                "But he had no cigarette-case. No one had ever happened to give him one, so\n      he hadn't the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he regarded as\n      effeminate.",
                "Last, he stuck in his lapel the Boosters' Club button. With the\n      conciseness of great art the button displayed two words: \"Boosters-Pep!\"\n       It made Babbitt feel loyal and important. It associated him with Good\n      Fellows, with men who were nice and human, and important in business\n      circles. It was his V.C., his Legion of Honor ribbon, his Phi Beta Kappa\n      key.",
                "With the subtleties of dressing ran other complex worries. \"I feel kind of\n      punk this morning,\" he said. \"I think I had too much dinner last evening.\n      You oughtn't to serve those heavy banana fritters.\"",
                "\"But you asked me to have some.\"",
                "\"I know, but -- I tell you, when a fellow gets past forty he has to\n      look after his digestion. There's a lot of fellows that don't take proper\n      care of themselves. I tell you at forty a man's a fool or his doctor -- I\n      mean, his own doctor. Folks don't give enough attention to this matter of\n      dieting. Now I think -- Course a man ought to have a good meal after\n      the day's work, but it would be a good thing for both of us if we took\n      lighter lunches.\"",
                "\"But Georgie, here at home I always do have a light lunch.\"",
                "\"Mean to imply I make a hog of myself, eating down-town? Yes, sure! You'd\n      have a swell time if you had to eat the truck that new steward hands out\n      to us at the Athletic Club! But I certainly do feel out of sorts, this\n      morning. Funny, got a pain down here on the left side -- but no, that\n      wouldn't be appendicitis, would it? Last night, when I was driving over to\n      Verg Gunch's, I felt a pain in my stomach, too. Right here it was -- kind\n      of a sharp shooting pain. I -- Where'd that dime go to? Why don't you\n      serve more prunes at breakfast? Of course I eat an apple every evening -- an\n      apple a day keeps the doctor away -- but still, you ought to have more\n      prunes, and not all these fancy doodads.\"",
                "\"The last time I had prunes you didn't eat them.\"",
                "\"Well, I didn't feel like eating 'em, I suppose. Matter of fact, I think I\n      did eat some of 'em. Anyway -- I tell you it's mighty important to -- I\n      was saying to Verg Gunch, just last evening, most people don't take\n      sufficient care of their diges -- \"",
                "\"Shall we have the Gunches for our dinner, next week?\"",
                "\"Why sure; you bet.\"",
                "\"Now see here, George: I want you to put on your nice dinner-jacket that\n      evening.\"",
                "\"Rats! The rest of 'em won't want to dress.\"",
                "\"Of course they will. You remember when you didn't dress for the\n      Littlefields' supper-party, and all the rest did, and how embarrassed you\n      were.\"",
                "\"Embarrassed, hell! I wasn't embarrassed. Everybody knows I can put on as\n      expensive a Tux. as anybody else, and I should worry if I don't happen to\n      have it on sometimes. All a darn nuisance, anyway. All right for a woman,\n      that stays around the house all the time, but when a fellow's worked like\n      the dickens all day, he doesn't want to go and hustle his head off getting\n      into the soup-and-fish for a lot of folks that he's seen in just reg'lar\n      ordinary clothes that same day.\"",
                "\"You know you enjoy being seen in one. The other evening you admitted you\n      were glad I'd insisted on your dressing. You said you felt a lot better\n      for it. And oh, Georgie, I do wish you wouldn't say 'Tux.' It's\n      'dinner-jacket.'\"",
                "\"Rats, what's the odds?\"",
                "\"Well, it's what all the nice folks say. Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard you\n      calling it a 'Tux.'\"",
                "\"Well, that's all right now! Lucile McKelvey can't pull anything on me!\n      Her folks are common as mud, even if her husband and her dad are\n      millionaires! I suppose you're trying to rub in your exalted social\n      position! Well, let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor, Henry\n      T., doesn't even call it a 'Tux.'! He calls it a 'bobtail jacket for a\n      ringtail monkey,' and you couldn't get him into one unless you\n      chloroformed him!\"",
                "\"Now don't be horrid, George.\"",

This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise;\n      and though the center of the city was three miles away -- Zenith had\n      between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now -- he could see\n      the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of\n      thirty-five stories.",
                "Its shining walls rose against April sky to a simple cornice like a streak\n      of white fire. Integrity was in the tower, and decision. It bore its\n      strength lightly as a tall soldier. As Babbitt stared, the nervousness was\n      soothed from his face, his slack chin lifted in reverence. All he\n      articulated was \"That's one lovely sight!\" but he was inspired by the\n      rhythm of the city; his love of it renewed. He beheld the tower as a\n      temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted,\n      surpassing common men; and as he clumped down to breakfast he whistled the\n      ballad \"Oh, by gee, by gosh, by jingo\" as though it were a hymn melancholy\n      and noble."

                "It gave on the sleeping-porch. It served both of them as dressing-room,\n      and on the coldest nights Babbitt luxuriously gave up the duty of being\n      manly and retreated to the bed inside, to curl his toes in the warmth and\n      laugh at the January gale.",
                "The room displayed a modest and pleasant color-scheme, after one of the\n      best standard designs of the decorator who \"did the interiors\" for most of\n      the speculative-builders' houses in Zenith. The walls were gray, the\n      woodwork white, the rug a serene blue; and very much like mahogany was the\n      furniture -- the bureau with its great clear mirror, Mrs. Babbitt's\n      dressing-table with toilet-articles of almost solid silver, the plain twin\n      beds, between them a small table holding a standard electric bedside lamp,\n      a glass for water, and a standard bedside book with colored illustrations -- what\n      particular book it was cannot be ascertained, since no one had ever opened\n      it. The mattresses were firm but not hard, triumphant modern mattresses\n      which had cost a great deal of money; the hot-water radiator was of\n      exactly the proper scientific surface for the cubic contents of the room.\n      The windows were large and easily opened, with the best catches and cords,\n      and Holland roller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a masterpiece\n      among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes.\n      Only it had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If\n      people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain\n      in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It\n      had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel.

Throughout,\n      electricity took the place of candles and slatternly hearth-fires. Along\n      the bedroom baseboard were three plugs for electric lamps, concealed by\n      little brass doors. In the halls were plugs for the vacuum cleaner, and in\n      the living-room plugs for the piano lamp, for the electric fan. The trim\n      dining-room (with its admirable oak buffet, its leaded-glass cupboard, its\n      creamy plaster walls, its modest scene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of\n      oysters) had plugs which supplied the electric percolator and the electric\n      toaster.",

He really\n      disliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it\n      was frequent. He shouted at Tinka, \"Well, kittiedoolie!\" It was the only\n      pet name in his vocabulary, except the \"dear\" and \"hon.\" with which he\n      recognized his wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning.",
                "He gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his\n      soul. His stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him, but\n      Verona began to be conscientious and annoying, and abruptly there returned\n      to Babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business which had\n      clawed at him when his dream-life and the slim fairy girl had fled.",
                "Verona had for six months been filing-clerk at the Gruensberg Leather\n      Company offices, with a prospect of becoming secretary to Mr. Gruensberg\n      and thus, as Babbitt defined it, \"getting some good out of your expensive\n      college education till you're ready to marry and settle down.\"",
                "But now said Verona: \"Father! I was talking to a classmate of mine that's\n      working for the Associated Charities -- oh, Dad, there's the sweetest\n      little babies that come to the milk-station there! -- and I feel as\n      though I ought to be doing something worth while like that.\"",

                "\"I know, but -- oh, I want to -- contribute -- I wish I were\n      working in a settlement-house. I wonder if I could get one of the\n      department-stores to let me put in a welfare-department with a nice\n      rest-room and chintzes and wicker chairs and so on and so forth.

                "\"Course you're not!

                "\"That'll do now!\" Babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the\n      gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating\n      drug of the Advocate-Times headlines.",
                "Ted negotiated: \"Gee, honest, Rone, I don't want to take the old boat, but\n      I promised couple o' girls in my class I'd drive 'em down to the rehearsal\n      of the school chorus, and, gee, I don't want to, but a gentleman's got to\n      keep his social engagements.\"",

                "Somewhat later, after diplomacies, Ted persuaded Verona to admit that she\n      was merely going to the Armory, that evening, to see the dog and cat show.\n      She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the candy-store\n      across from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were masterly\n      arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline tank\n      filled; and passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they hymned the\n      patch on the spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle.",
                "Their truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were \"a scream of a\n      bunch-stuck-up gabby four-flushers.\" His friends, she indicated, were\n      \"disgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls.\"\n       Further: \"It's disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on and so\n      forth, and those clothes you've got on this morning, they're too utterly\n      ridiculous -- honestly, simply disgusting.\"",

His suit, the latest thing in Old Eli Togs, was\n      skin-tight, with skimpy trousers to the tops of his glaring tan boots, a\n      chorus-man waistline, pattern of an agitated check, and across the back a\n      belt which belted nothing. His scarf was an enormous black silk wad. His\n      flaxen hair was ice-smooth, pasted back without parting. When he went to\n      school he would add a cap with a long vizor like a shovel-blade. Proudest\n      of all was his waistcoat, saved for, begged for, plotted for; a real Fancy\n      Vest of fawn with polka dots of a decayed red, the points astoundingly\n      long. On the lower edge of it he wore a high-school button, a class\n      button, and a fraternity pin.",
                "And none of it mattered. He was supple and swift and flushed; his eyes\n      (which he believed to be cynical) were candidly eager. But he was not\n      over-gentle. He waved his hand at poor dumpy Verona and drawled: \"Yes, I\n      guess we're pretty ridiculous and disgusticulus, and I rather guess our\n      new necktie is some smear!\"",
                "Babbitt barked: \"It is! And while you're admiring yourself, let me tell\n      you it might add to your manly beauty if you wiped some of that egg off\n      your mouth!\"",
                "Verona giggled, momentary victor in the greatest of Great Wars, which is\n      the family war. Ted looked at her hopelessly, then shrieked at Tinka: \"For\n      the love o' Pete, quit pouring the whole sugar bowl on your corn flakes!\"",
                "When Verona and Ted were gone and Tinka upstairs, Babbitt groaned to his\n      wife: \"Nice family, I must say! I don't pretend to be any baa-lamb, and\n      maybe I'm a little cross-grained at breakfast sometimes, but the way they\n      go on jab-jab-jabbering, I simply can't stand it. I swear, I feel like\n      going off some place where I can get a little peace. I do think after a\n      man's spent his lifetime trying to give his kids a chance and a decent\n      education, it's pretty discouraging to hear them all the time scrapping\n      like a bunch of hyenas and never -- and never -- Curious; here in\n      the paper it says -- Never silent for one mom -- Seen the morning\n      paper yet?\"",
                "\"No, dear.\" In twenty-three years of married life, Mrs. Babbitt had seen\n      the paper before her husband just sixty-seven times.",
                "\"Lots of news. Terrible big tornado in the South. Hard luck, all right.\n      But this, say, this is corking! Beginning of the end for those fellows!\n      New York Assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw\n      the socialists! And there's an elevator-runners' strike in New York and a\n      lot of college boys are taking their places. That's the stuff!

                "This morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong, and he felt\n      belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn't\n      even brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by\n      fenders, as he backed out of the garage. He was confused. He shouted\n      \"Morning!\" to Sam Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended.",
                "Babbitt's green and white Dutch Colonial house was one of three in that\n      block on Chatham Road. To the left of it was the residence of Mr. Samuel\n      Doppelbrau, secretary of an excellent firm of bathroom-fixture jobbers.\n      His was a comfortable house with no architectural manners whatever; a\n      large wooden box with a squat tower, a broad porch, and glossy paint\n      yellow as a yolk. Babbitt disapproved of Mr. and Mrs. Doppelbrau as\n      \"Bohemian.\" From their house came midnight music and obscene laughter;\n      there were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor rides.\n      They furnished Babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion, during\n      which he announced firmly, \"I'm not strait-laced, and I don't mind seeing\n      a fellow throw in a drink once in a while, but when it comes to\n      deliberately trying to get away with a lot of hell-raising all the while\n      like the Doppelbraus do, it's too rich for my blood!\"",
                "On the other side of Babbitt lived Howard Littlefield, Ph.D., in a\n      strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry brick,\n      with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered clay,\n      and the roof red-tiled. Littlefield was the Great Scholar of the\n      neighborhood; the authority on everything in the world except babies,\n      cooking, and motors. He was a Bachelor of Arts of Blodgett College, and a\n      Doctor of Philosophy in economics of Yale. He was the employment-manager\n      and publicity-counsel of the Zenith Street Traction Company. He could, on\n      ten hours' notice, appear before the board of aldermen or the state\n      legislature and prove, absolutely, with figures all in rows and with\n      precedents from Poland and New Zealand, that the street-car company loved\n      the Public and yearned over its employees; that all its stock was owned by\n      Widows and Orphans; and that whatever it desired to do would benefit\n      property-owners by increasing rental values, and help the poor by lowering\n      rents. All his acquaintances turned to Littlefield when they desired to\n      know the date of the battle of Saragossa, the definition of the word\n      \"sabotage,\" the future of the German mark, the translation of \"hinc illae\n      lachrimae,\" or the number of products of coal tar. He awed Babbitt by\n      confessing that he often sat up till midnight reading the figures and\n      footnotes in Government reports, or skimming (with amusement at the\n      author's mistakes) the latest volumes of chemistry, archeology, and\n      ichthyology.",
                "But Littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his\n      strange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a Republican\n      as George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the faith. Where\n      they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and\n      manners was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to them, out of\n      history, economics, and the confessions of reformed radicals.",
                "Babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a\n      savant, and in Ted's intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice\n      was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries\n      of motion-picture stars, but -- as Babbitt definitively put it -- \"she\n      was her father's daughter.\"",
                "The difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine\n      character like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances. Doppelbrau\n      was disturbingly young for a man of forty-eight. He wore his derby on the\n      back of his head, and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless laughter.\n      But Littlefield was old for a man of forty-two. He was tall, broad, thick;\n      his gold-rimmed spectacles were engulfed in the folds of his long face;\n      his hair was a tossed mass of greasy blackness; he puffed and rumbled as\n      he talked; his Phi Beta Kappa key shone against a spotty black vest; he\n      smelled of old pipes; he was altogether funereal and archidiaconal; and to\n      real-estate brokerage and the jobbing of bathroom-fixtures he added an\n      aroma of sanctity.",
                "This morning he was in front of his house, inspecting the grass parking\n      between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car\n      and leaned out to shout \"Mornin'!\" Littlefield lumbered over and stood\n      with one foot up on the running-board.",
                "\"Fine morning,\" said Babbitt, lighting -- illegally early -- his\n      second cigar of the day.",
                "\"Yes, it's a mighty fine morning,\" said Littlefield.",
                "\"Spring coming along fast now.\"",
                "\"Yes, it's real spring now, all right,\" said Littlefield.",
                "\"Still cold nights, though. Had to have a couple blankets, on the\n      sleeping-porch last night.\"",
                "\"Yes, it wasn't any too warm last night,\" said Littlefield.",
                "\"But I don't anticipate we'll have any more real cold weather now.\"",
                "\"No, but still, there was snow at Tiflis, Montana, yesterday,\" said the\n      Scholar, \"and you remember the blizzard they had out West three days ago -- thirty\n      inches of snow at Greeley, Colorado -- and two years ago we had a\n      snow-squall right here in Zenith on the twenty-fifth of April.\"",
                "\"Is that a fact! Say, old man, what do you think about the Republican\n      candidate? Who'll they nominate for president? Don't you think it's about\n      time we had a real business administration?\"",
                "\"In my opinion, what the country needs, first and foremost, is a good,\n      sound, business-like conduct of its affairs. What we need is -- a\n      business administration!\" said Littlefield.",
                "\"I'm glad to hear you say that! I certainly am glad to hear you say that!\n      I didn't know how you'd feel about it, with all your associations with\n      colleges and so on, and I'm glad you feel that way. What the country needs -- just\n      at this present juncture -- is neither a college president nor a lot of\n      monkeying with foreign affairs, but a good -- sound economical -- business -- administration,\n      that will give us a chance to have something like a decent turnover.\"",
                "\"Yes. It isn't generally realized that even in China the schoolmen are\n      giving way to more practical men, and of course you can see what that\n      implies.\"",
                "\"Is that a fact! Well, well!\" breathed Babbitt, feeling much calmer, and\n      much happier about the way things were going in the world. \"Well, it's\n      been nice to stop and parleyvoo a second. Guess I'll have to get down to\n      the office now and sting a few clients. Well, so long, old man. See you\n      tonight. So long.\"",
                "II",
                "They had labored, these solid citizens. Twenty years before, the hill on\n      which Floral Heights was spread, with its bright roofs and immaculate turf\n      and amazing comfort, had been a wilderness of rank second-growth elms and\n      oaks and maples. Along the precise streets were still a few wooded vacant\n      lots, and the fragment of an old orchard. It was brilliant to-day; the\n      apple boughs were lit with fresh leaves like torches of green fire. The\n      first white of cherry blossoms flickered down a gully, and robins\n      clamored.",
                "Babbitt sniffed the earth, chuckled at the hysteric robins as he would\n      have chuckled at kittens or at a comic movie. He was, to the eye, the\n      perfect office-going executive -- a well-fed man in a correct brown\n      soft hat and frameless spectacles, smoking a large cigar, driving a good\n      motor along a semi-suburban parkway. But in him was some genius of\n      authentic love for his neighborhood, his city, his clan. The winter was\n      over; the time was come for the building, the visible growth, which to him\n      was glory. He lost his dawn depression; he was ruddily cheerful when he\n      stopped on Smith Street to leave the brown trousers, and to have the\n      gasoline-tank filled.",
                "The familiarity of the rite fortified him: the sight of the tall red iron\n      gasoline-pump, the hollow-tile and terra-cotta garage, the window full of\n      the most agreeable accessories -- shiny casings, spark-plugs with\n      immaculate porcelain jackets tire-chains of gold and silver. He was\n      flattered by the friendliness with which Sylvester Moon, dirtiest and most\n      skilled of motor mechanics, came out to serve him. \"Mornin', Mr. Babbitt!\"\n       said Moon, and Babbitt felt himself a person of importance, one whose name\n      even busy garagemen remembered -- not one of these cheap-sports flying\n      around in flivvers. He admired the ingenuity of the automatic dial,\n      clicking off gallon by gallon; admired the smartness of the sign: \"A fill\n      in time saves getting stuck -- gas to-day 31 cents\"; admired the\n      rhythmic gurgle of the gasoline as it flowed into the tank, and the\n      mechanical regularity with which Moon turned the handle.",
                "\"How much we takin' to-day?\" asked Moon, in a manner which combined the\n      independence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar\n      gossip, and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F.\n      Babbitt.",
                "\"Fill 'er up.\"",
                "\"Who you rootin' for for Republican candidate, Mr. Babbitt?\"",
                "\"It's too early to make any predictions yet. After all, there's still a\n      good month and two weeks -- no, three weeks -- must be almost three\n      weeks -- well, there's more than six weeks in all before the Republican\n      convention, and I feel a fellow ought to keep an open mind and give all\n      the candidates a show -- look 'em all over and size 'em up, and then\n      decide carefully.\"",
                "\"That's a fact, Mr. Babbitt.\"",
                "\"But I'll tell you -- and my stand on this is just the same as it was\n      four years ago, and eight years ago, and it'll be my stand four years from\n      now -- yes, and eight years from now! What I tell everybody, and it\n      can't be too generally understood, is that what we need first, last, and\n      all the time is a good, sound business administration!\"",

                "\"Well, I do try and have some sense about it.\" Babbitt paid his bill, said\n      adequately, \"Oh, keep the change,\" and drove off in an ecstasy of honest\n      self-appreciation. It was with the manner of a Good Samaritan that he\n      shouted at a respectable-looking man who was waiting for a trolley car,\n      \"Have a lift?\" As the man climbed in Babbitt condescended, \"Going clear\n      down-town? Whenever I see a fellow waiting for a trolley, I always make it\n      a practice to give him a lift -- unless, of course, he looks like a\n      bum.\"",
                "\"Wish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines,\"\n       dutifully said the victim of benevolence. \"Oh, no, 'tain't a question of\n      generosity, hardly. Fact, I always feel -- I was saying to my son just\n      the other night -- it's a fellow's duty to share the good things of\n      this world with his neighbors, and it gets my goat when a fellow gets\n      stuck on himself and goes around tooting his horn merely because he's\n      charitable.\"",
                "The victim seemed unable to find the right answer. Babbitt boomed on:",
                "\"Pretty punk service the Company giving us on these car-lines. Nonsense to\n      only run the Portland Road cars once every seven minutes. Fellow gets\n      mighty cold on a winter morning, waiting on a street corner with the wind\n      nipping at his ankles.\"",
                "\"That's right. The Street Car Company don't care a damn what kind of a\n      deal they give us. Something ought to happen to 'em.\"",
                "Babbitt was alarmed. \"But still, of course it won't do to just keep\n      knocking the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they're\n      operating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The way\n      these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime, and of\n      course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a seven-cent fare!\n      Fact, there's remarkable service on all their lines -- considering.\"",
                "\"Well -- \" uneasily.",
                "\"Darn fine morning,\" Babbitt explained. \"Spring coming along fast.\"",
                "\"Yes, it's real spring now.\"",
                "The victim had no originality, no wit, and Babbitt fell into a great\n      silence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the\n      corner: a spurt, a tail-chase, nervous speeding between the huge yellow\n      side of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors, shooting past\n      just as the trolley stopped -- a rare game and valiant.",
                "And all the while he was conscious of the loveliness of Zenith. For weeks\n      together he noticed nothing but clients and the vexing To Rent signs of\n      rival brokers. To-day, in mysterious malaise, he raged or rejoiced with\n      equal nervous swiftness, and to-day the light of spring was so winsome\n      that he lifted his head and saw.",
                "He admired each district along his familiar route to the office: The\n      bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular drive ways of Floral Heights.\n      The one-story shops on Smith Street, a glare of plate-glass and new yellow\n      brick; groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more\n      immediate needs of East Side housewives. The market gardens in Dutch\n      Hollow, their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors.\n      Billboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films,\n      pipe tobacco, and talcum powder. The old \"mansions\" along Ninth Street, S.\n      E., like aged dandies in filthy linen; wooden castles turned into\n      boarding-houses, with muddy walks and rusty hedges, jostled by\n      fast-intruding garages, cheap apartment-houses, and fruit-stands conducted\n      by bland, sleek Athenians. Across the belt of railroad-tracks, factories\n      with high-perched water-tanks and tall stacks-factories producing\n      condensed milk, paper boxes, lighting-fixtures, motor cars. Then the\n      business center, the thickening darting traffic, the crammed trolleys\n      unloading, and high doorways of marble and polished granite.",
                "It was big -- and Babbitt respected bigness in anything; in mountains,\n      jewels, muscles, wealth, or words. He was, for a spring-enchanted moment,\n      the lyric and almost unselfish lover of Zenith. He thought of the outlying\n      factory suburbs; of the Chaloosa River with its strangely eroded banks; of\n      the orchard-dappled Tonawanda Hills to the North, and all the fat dairy\n      land and big barns and comfortable herds. As he dropped his passenger he\n      cried, \"Gosh, I feel pretty good this morning!\" III",
                "Epochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it before he entered\n      his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner into Third\n      Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space in the line of parked cars. He\n      angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it. Ahead, another\n      car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out his hand to\n      the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old woman to\n      go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side. With\n      front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he\n      stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel, slid back into the vacant\n      space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvered to bring the car\n      level with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully executed. With\n      satisfaction he locked a thief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and\n      crossed the street to his real-estate office on the ground floor of the\n      Reeves Building.",
                "The Reeves Building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a\n      typewriter; fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick, with clean, upright,\n      unornamented lines. It was filled with the offices of lawyers, doctors,\n      agents for machinery, for emery wheels, for wire fencing, for\n      mining-stock. Their gold signs shone on the windows. The entrance was too\n      modern to be flamboyant with pillars; it was quiet, shrewd, neat. Along\n      the Third Street side were a Western Union Telegraph Office, the Blue\n      Delft Candy Shop, Shotwell's Stationery Shop, and the Babbitt-Thompson\n      Realty Company.",
                "Babbitt could have entered his office from the street, as customers did,\n      but it made him feel an insider to go through the corridor of the building\n      and enter by the back door. Thus he was greeted by the villagers.",
                "The little unknown people who inhabited the Reeves Building corridors -- elevator-runners,\n      starter, engineers, superintendent, and the doubtful-looking lame man who\n      conducted the news and cigar stand -- were in no way city-dwellers.\n      They were rustics, living in a constricted valley, interested only in one\n      another and in The Building. Their Main Street was the entrance hall, with\n      its stone floor, severe marble ceiling, and the inner windows of the\n      shops. The liveliest place on the street was the Reeves Building Barber\n      Shop, but this was also Babbitt's one embarrassment. Himself, he\n      patronized the glittering Pompeian Barber Shop in the Hotel Thornleigh,\n      and every time he passed the Reeves shop -- ten times a day, a hundred\n      times -- he felt untrue to his own village.",
                "Now, as one of the squirearchy, greeted with honorable salutations by the\n      villagers, he marched into his office, and peace and dignity were upon\n      him, and the morning's dissonances all unheard.",

                "As Babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of\n      oak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard it\n      was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make\n      sales.",
                "There were nine members of the staff, besides Babbitt and his partner and\n      father-in-law, Henry Thompson, who rarely came to the office.

                "As he looked from his own cage into the main room Babbitt mourned,\n      \"McGoun's a good stenog., smart's a whip, but Stan Graff and all those\n      bums -- \" The zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale\n      office air.",
                "Normally he admired the office, with a pleased surprise that he should\n      have created this sure lovely thing; normally he was stimulated by the\n      clean newness of it and the air of bustle; but to-day it seemed flat -- the\n      tiled floor, like a bathroom, the ocher-colored metal ceiling, the faded\n      maps on the hard plaster walls, the chairs of varnished pale oak, the\n      desks and filing-cabinets of steel painted in olive drab. It was a vault,\n      a steel chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin.",
                "He hadn't even any satisfaction in the new water-cooler! And it was the\n      very best of water-coolers, up-to-date, scientific, and right-thinking. It\n      had cost a great deal of money (in itself a virtue). It possessed a\n      non-conducting fiber ice-container, a porcelain water-jar (guaranteed\n      hygienic), a drip-less non-clogging sanitary faucet, and machine-painted\n      decorations in two tones of gold. He looked down the relentless stretch of\n      tiled floor at the water-cooler, and assured himself that no tenant of the\n      Reeves Building had a more expensive one, but he could not recapture the\n      feeling of social superiority it had given him. He astoundingly grunted,\n      \"I'd like to beat it off to the woods right now. And loaf all day.

Inspired, he rushed out and locked up\n      his cigars, his cigarettes, and even his box of safety matches; and the\n      key to the file drawer he hid in his desk. But the crusading passion of it\n      made him so tobacco-hungry that he immediately recovered the key, walked\n      with forbidding dignity to the file, took out a cigar and a match -- \"but\n      only one match; if ole cigar goes out, it'll by golly have to stay out!\"\n       Later, when the cigar did go out, he took one more match from the file,\n      and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven-thirty,\n      naturally he had to offer them cigars. His conscience protested, \"Why,\n      you're smoking with them!\" but he bullied it, \"Oh, shut up! I'm busy now.\n      Of course by-and-by -- \" There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he\n      had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy.

Paul had gone into his father's business, after\n      graduation; he was now a wholesaler and small manufacturer of\n      prepared-paper roofing. But Babbitt strenuously believed and lengthily\n      announced to the world of Good Fellows that Paul could have been a great\n      violinist or painter or writer. \"Why say, the letters that boy sent me on\n      his trip to the Canadian Rockies, they just absolutely make you see the\n      place as if you were standing there.

                "Babbitt's virtues as a real-estate broker -- as the servant of society\n      in the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors\n      of food -- were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest,\n      he kept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with\n      leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were\n      broad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong\n      enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet\n      his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and\n      complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned\n      out by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of\n      curving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest\n      axioms of economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the\n      real-estate business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it was\n      a good advertisement at Boosters' Club lunches, and all the varieties of\n      Annual Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to speak sonorously of\n      Unselfish Public Service, the Broker's Obligation to Keep Inviolate the\n      Trust of His Clients, and a thing called Ethics, whose nature was\n      confusing but if you had it you were a High-class Realtor and if you\n      hadn't you were a shyster, a piker, and a fly-by-night. These virtues\n      awakened Confidence, and enabled you to handle Bigger Propositions. But\n      they didn't imply that you were to be impractical and refuse to take twice\n      the value of a house if a buyer was such an idiot that he didn't jew you\n      down on the asking-price.",
                "Babbitt spoke well -- and often -- at these orgies of commercial\n      righteousness about the \"realtor's function as a seer of the future\n      development of the community, and as a prophetic engineer clearing the\n      pathway for inevitable changes\" -- which meant that a real-estate\n      broker could make money by guessing which way the town would grow. This\n      guessing he called Vision.",
                "In an address at the Boosters' Club he had admitted, \"It is at once the\n      duty and the privilege of the realtor to know everything about his own\n      city and its environs. Where a surgeon is a specialist on every vein and\n      mysterious cell of the human body, and the engineer upon electricity in\n      all its phases, or every bolt of some great bridge majestically arching\n      o'er a mighty flood, the realtor must know his city, inch by inch, and all\n      its faults and virtues.\"",
                "Though he did know the market-price, inch by inch, of certain districts of\n      Zenith, he did not know whether the police force was too large or too\n      small, or whether it was in alliance with gambling and prostitution. He\n      knew the means of fire-proofing buildings and the relation of\n      insurance-rates to fire-proofing, but he did not know how many firemen\n      there were in the city, how they were trained and paid, or how complete\n      their apparatus. He sang eloquently the advantages of proximity of\n      school-buildings to rentable homes, but he did not know -- he did not\n      know that it was worth while to know -- whether the city schoolrooms\n      were properly heated, lighted, ventilated, furnished; he did not know how\n      the teachers were chosen; and though he chanted \"One of the boasts of\n      Zenith is that we pay our teachers adequately,\" that was because he had\n      read the statement in the Advocate-Times. Himself, he could not have given\n      the average salary of teachers in Zenith or anywhere else.",
                "He had heard it said that \"conditions\" in the County Jail and the Zenith\n      City Prison were not very \"scientific;\" he had, with indignation at the\n      criticism of Zenith, skimmed through a report in which the notorious\n      pessimist Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, asserted that to throw boys\n      and young girls into a bull-pen crammed with men suffering from syphilis,\n      delirium tremens, and insanity was not the perfect way of educating them.\n      He had controverted the report by growling, \"Folks that think a jail ought\n      to be a bloomin' Hotel Thornleigh make me sick. If people don't like a\n      jail, let 'em behave 'emselves and keep out of it. Besides, these reform\n      cranks always exaggerate.\" That was the beginning and quite completely the\n      end of his investigations into Zenith's charities and corrections; and as\n      to the \"vice districts\" he brightly expressed it, \"Those are things that\n      no decent man monkeys with. Besides, smatter fact, I'll tell you\n      confidentially: it's a protection to our daughters and to decent women to\n      have a district where tough nuts can raise cain. Keeps 'em away from our\n      own homes.\"",
                "As to industrial conditions, however, Babbitt had thought a great deal,\n      and his opinions may be coordinated as follows:",
                "\"A good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions, which\n      would destroy property. No one ought to be forced to belong to a union,\n      however. All labor agitators who try to force men to join a union should\n      be hanged. In fact, just between ourselves, there oughtn't to be any\n      unions allowed at all; and as it's the best way of fighting the unions,\n      every business man ought to belong to an employers'-association and to the\n      Chamber of Commerce. In union there is strength. So any selfish hog who\n      doesn't join the Chamber of Commerce ought to be forced to.\"",
                "In nothing -- as the expert on whose advice families moved to new\n      neighborhoods to live there for a generation -- was Babbitt more\n      splendidly innocent than in the science of sanitation. He did not know a\n      malaria-bearing mosquito from a bat; he knew nothing about tests of\n      drinking water; and in the matters of plumbing and sewage he was as\n      unlearned as he was voluble. He often referred to the excellence of the\n      bathrooms in the houses he sold. He was fond of explaining why it was that\n      no European ever bathed. Some one had told him, when he was twenty-two,\n      that all cesspools were unhealthy, and he still denounced them. If a\n      client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a cesspool,\n      Babbitt always spoke about it -- before accepting the house and selling\n      it.",
                "When he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed\n      woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat\n      prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he\n      righteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior; it\n      enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development, Avonlea,\n      which had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the full-page\n      advertisements in which he announced the beauty, convenience, cheapness,\n      and supererogatory healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only flaw was that\n      the Glen Oriole sewers had insufficient outlet, so that waste remained in\n      them, not very agreeably, while the Avonlea cesspool was a Waring septic\n      tank.",
                "The whole of the Glen Oriole project was a suggestion that Babbitt, though\n      he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too unreasonably\n      honest. Operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not be in\n      competition with them as operators and buyers themselves, but attend to\n      their clients' interests only. It was supposed that the Babbitt-Thompson\n      Company were merely agents for Glen Oriole, serving the real owner, Jake\n      Offutt, but the fact was that Babbitt and Thompson owned sixty-two per\n      cent. of the Glen, the president and purchasing agent of the Zenith Street\n      Traction Company owned twenty-eight per cent., and Jake Offutt (a\n      gang-politician, a small manufacturer, a tobacco-chewing old farceur who\n      enjoyed dirty politics, business diplomacy, and cheating at poker) had\n      only ten per cent., which Babbitt and the Traction officials had given to\n      him for \"fixing\" health inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the\n      State Transportation Commission.",
                "But Babbitt was virtuous. He advocated, though he did not practise, the\n      prohibition of alcohol; he praised, though he did not obey, the laws\n      against motor-speeding; he paid his debts; he contributed to the church,\n      the Red Cross, and the Y. M. C. A.; he followed the custom of his clan and\n      cheated only as it was sanctified by precedent; and he never descended to\n      trickery -- though, as he explained to Paul Riesling:",
                "\"Course I don't mean to say that every ad I write is literally true or\n      that I always believe everything I say when I give some buyer a good\n      strong selling-spiel. You see -- you see it's like this: In the first\n      place, maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into my\n      hands, and it certainly isn't my place to go proving my principal a liar!\n      And then most folks are so darn crooked themselves that they expect a\n      fellow to do a little lying, so if I was fool enough to never whoop the\n      ante I'd get the credit for lying anyway! In self-defense I got to toot my\n      own horn, like a lawyer defending a client -- his bounden duty, ain't\n      it, to bring out the poor dub's good points? Why, the Judge himself would\n      bawl out a lawyer that didn't, even if they both knew the guy was guilty!\n      But even so, I don't pad out the truth like Cecil Rountree or Thayer or\n      the rest of these realtors. Fact, I think a fellow that's willing to\n      deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot!\"",
                "Babbitt's value to his clients was rarely better shown than this morning,\n      in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, Conrad Lyte, and\n      Archibald Purdy.",

                "Conrad Lyte was a real-estate speculator. He was a nervous speculator.\n      Before he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects, contracting\n      builders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing to be\n      cornered and give him advice. He was a bold entrepreneur, and he desired\n      nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom from\n      attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit which,\n      according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks and\n      foresight. He was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray curls\n      and clothes which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. Below his eyes\n      were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been pressed\n      against them and had left an imprint.",

                "Six months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in\n      the indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of\n      opening a butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of\n      adjoining parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present shop\n      but did not own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad Lyte to\n      purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a\n      basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand. The\n      rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they could make\n      Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into\n      buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the rent of the\n      battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number of rude\n      things, but he paid.",
                "Now, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten\n      thousand extra dollars -- the reward paid by the community to Mr.\n      Conrad Lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who\n      understood Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations,\n      Underappraisals, and the Psychology of Salesmanship.",
                "Lyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this\n      morning, and called him \"old hoss.\" Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man\n      and solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt\n      met him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private\n      room with affectionate little cries of \"This way, Brother Purdy!\" He took\n      from the correspondence-file the entire box of cigars and forced them on\n      his guests. He pushed their chairs two inches forward and three inches\n      back, which gave an hospitable note, then leaned back in his desk-chair\n      and looked plump and jolly. But he spoke to the weakling grocer with\n      firmness.",
                "\"Well, Brother Purdy, we been having some pretty tempting offers from\n      butchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store, but I\n      persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the property\n      first. I said to Lyte, 'It'd be a rotten shame,' I said, 'if somebody went\n      and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and\n      ruined Purdy's nice little business.' Especially -- \" Babbitt leaned\n      forward, and his voice was harsh, \" -- it would be hard luck if one of\n      these cash-and-carry chain-stores got in there and started cutting prices\n      below cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall!\"",
                "Purdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets, pulled up his trousers,\n      thrust his hands back into his pockets, tilted in the heavy oak chair, and\n      tried to look amused, as he struggled:",
                "\"Yes, they're bad competition. But I guess you don't realize the Pulling\n      Power that Personality has in a neighborhood business.\"",
                "The great Babbitt smiled. \"That's so. Just as you feel, old man. We\n      thought we'd give you first chance. All right then -- \"",
                "\"Now look here!\" Purdy wailed. \"I know f'r a fact that a piece of property\n      'bout same size, right near, sold for less 'n eighty-five hundred,\n      'twa'n't two years ago, and here you fellows are asking me twenty-four\n      thousand dollars! Why, I'd have to mortgage -- I wouldn't mind so much\n      paying twelve thousand but -- Why good God, Mr. Babbitt, you're asking\n      more 'n twice its value! And threatening to ruin me if I don't take it!\"",
                "\"Purdy, I don't like your way of talking! I don't like it one little bit!\n      Supposing Lyte and I were stinking enough to want to ruin any fellow\n      human, don't you suppose we know it's to our own selfish interest to have\n      everybody in Zenith prosperous? But all this is beside the point. Tell you\n      what we'll do: We'll come down to twenty-three thousand-five thousand down\n      and the rest on mortgage -- and if you want to wreck the old shack and\n      rebuild, I guess I can get Lyte here to loosen up for a building-mortgage\n      on good liberal terms. Heavens, man, we'd be glad to oblige you! We don't\n      like these foreign grocery trusts any better 'n you do! But it isn't\n      reasonable to expect us to sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for\n      neighborliness, IS it! How about it, Lyte? You willing to come down?\"",
                "By warmly taking Purdy's part, Babbitt persuaded the benevolent Mr. Lyte\n      to reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars. At the right moment\n      Babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had Miss McGoun type\n      out a week ago and thrust it into Purdy's hands. He genially shook his\n      fountain pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to Purdy, and\n      approvingly watched him sign.",
                "The work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine\n      thousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar\n      commission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance, been\n      provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants of\n      Linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher\n      than those down-town.",
                "It had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the\n      only really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing ahead\n      save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages.",
                "He muttered, \"Makes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the\n      profit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And -- What else\n      have I got to do to-day?... Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip.\n      Something.\" He sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul\n      Riesling."

His high moment came in the clash of traffic\n      when he was halted at the corner beneath the lofty Second National Tower.\n      His car was banked with four others in a line of steel restless as\n      cavalry, while the cross town traffic, limousines and enormous moving-vans\n      and insistent motor-cycles, poured by; on the farther corner, pneumatic\n      riveters rang on the sun-plated skeleton of a new building; and out of\n      this tornado flashed the inspiration of a familiar face, and a fellow\n      Booster shouted, \"H' are you, George!\" Babbitt waved in neighborly\n      affection, and slid on with the traffic as the policeman lifted his hand.\n      He noted how quickly his car picked up.

But\n      most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch,\n      play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain out-of town uncles\n      at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is the\n      conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call \"a\n      rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole -- not one Good Mixer in the\n      place -- you couldn't hire me to join.\" Statistics show that no member\n      of the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who\n      are elected, sixty-seven per cent. resign from the Athletic and are\n      thereafter heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of the Union lounge, \"The\n      Athletic would be a pretty good hotel, if it were more exclusive.\"",
                "The Athletic Club building is nine stories high, yellow brick with glassy\n      roof-garden above and portico of huge limestone columns below. The lobby,\n      with its thick pillars of porous Caen stone, its pointed vaulting, and a\n      brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is a combination of\n      cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. The members rush into the lobby as though\n      they were shopping and hadn't much time for it. Thus did Babbitt enter,\n      and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he whooped, \"How's the\n      boys? How's the boys? Well, well, fine day!\"",
                "Jovially they whooped back -- Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, Sidney\n      Finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for Parcher & Stein's\n      department-store, and Professor Joseph K. Pumphrey, owner of the Riteway\n      Business College and instructor in Public Speaking, Business English,\n      Scenario Writing, and Commercial Law. Though Babbitt admired this savant,\n      and appreciated Sidney Finkelstein as \"a mighty smart buyer and a good\n      liberal spender,\" it was to Vergil Gunch that he turned with enthusiasm.\n      Mr. Gunch was president of the Boosters' Club, a weekly lunch-club, local\n      chapter of a national organization which promoted sound business and\n      friendliness among Regular Fellows. He was also no less an official than\n      Esteemed Leading Knight in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks,\n      and it was rumored that at the next election he would be a candidate for\n      Exalted Ruler. He was a jolly man, given to oratory and to chumminess with\n      the arts. He called on the famous actors and vaudeville artists when they\n      came to town, gave them cigars, addressed them by their first names, and -- sometimes -- succeeded\n      in bringing them to the Boosters' lunches to give The Boys a Free\n      Entertainment. He was a large man with hair en brosse, and he knew the\n      latest jokes, but he played poker close to the chest. It was at his party\n      that Babbitt had sucked in the virus of to-day's restlessness.",

                "\"Good hunch!\" said Finkelstein, while even the learned Professor Pumphrey,\n      a bulbous man with a pepper-and-salt cutaway and a pipe-organ voice,\n      commented, \"That makes a dandy accessory. Cigar-lighter gives tone to the\n      dashboard.\"",
                "\"Yep, finally decided I'd buy me one. Got the best on the market, the\n      clerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. Just wondering if I got stuck.\n      What do they charge for 'em at the store, Sid?\"",
                "Finkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum, not for a\n      really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with\n      connections of the very best quality. \"I always say -- and believe me,\n      I base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience -- the\n      best is the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be a\n      Jew about it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long RUN, the cheapest\n      thing is -- the best you can get! Now you take here just th' other day:\n      I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a\n      hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say\n      that was too much -- Lord, if the Old Folks -- they live in one of\n      these hick towns up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city\n      fellow's mind works, and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie\n      right down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six\n      bones. But I don't figure I was stuck, George, not a bit. Machine looks\n      brand new now -- not that it's so darned old, of course; had it less 'n\n      three years, but I give it hard service; never drive less 'n a hundred\n      miles on Sunday and, uh -- Oh, I don't really think you got stuck,\n      George. In the LONG run, the best is, you might say, it's unquestionably\n      the cheapest.\"",
                "\"That's right,\" said Vergil Gunch. \"That's the way I look at it. If a\n      fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you\n      get it here in Zenith -- all the hustle and mental activity that's\n      going on with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the\n      Z.A.C., why, he's got to save his nerves by having the best.\"",
                "Babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and by\n      the conclusion, in Gunch's renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:",
                "\"Still, at that, George, don't know's you can afford it. I've heard your\n      business has been kind of under the eye of the gov'ment since you stole\n      the tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!\"",
                "\"Oh, you're a great little josher, Verg. But when it comes to kidding, how\n      about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the\n      post-office and sold 'em for high-grade coal!\" In delight Babbitt patted\n      Gunch's back, stroked his arm.",
                "\"That's all right, but what I want to know is: who's the real-estate shark\n      that bought that coal for his apartment-houses?\"",
                "\"I guess that'll hold you for a while, George!\" said Finkelstein. \"I'll\n      tell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George's missus went into the\n      gents' wear department at Parcher's to buy him some collars, and before\n      she could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. 'How juh\n      know the size?' says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, 'Men that let their\n      wives buy collars for 'em always wear thirteen, madam.' How's that! That's\n      pretty good, eh? How's that, eh? I guess that'll about fix you, George!\"",
                "\"I -- I -- \" Babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. He\n      stopped, stared at the door. Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried,\n      \"See you later, boys,\" and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then,\n      neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the\n      breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference,\n      nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic\n      Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him,\n      admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women.\n      Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had\n      been parted three years, not three days -- and they said:",
                "\"How's the old horse-thief?\"",
                "\"All right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\"",
                "\"I'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\"",
                "Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \"You're a fine\n      guy, you are! Ten minutes late!\" Riesling snapped, \"Well, you're lucky to\n      have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\" They grinned and went into the\n      Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a\n      prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own\n      images in the massy mirror. Voices thick, satisfied, authoritative,\n      hurtled along the marble walls, bounded from the ceiling of\n      lavender-bordered milky tiles, while the lords of the city, the barons of\n      insurance and law and fertilizers and motor tires, laid down the law for\n      Zenith; announced that the day was warm-indeed, indisputably of spring;\n      that wages were too high and the interest on mortgages too low; that Babe\n      Ruth, the eminent player of baseball, was a noble man; and that \"those two\n      nuts at the Climax Vaudeville Theater this week certainly are a slick pair\n      of actors.\" Babbitt, though ordinarily his voice was the surest and most\n      episcopal of all, was silent. In the presence of the slight dark reticence\n      of Paul Riesling, he was awkward, he desired to be quiet and firm and\n      deft.",
                "The entrance lobby of the Athletic Club was Gothic, the washroom Roman\n      Imperial, the lounge Spanish Mission, and the reading-room in Chinese\n      Chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the masterpiece\n      of Ferdinand Reitman, Zenith's busiest architect. It was lofty and\n      half-timbered, with Tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a somewhat\n      musicianless musicians'-gallery, and tapestries believed to illustrate the\n      granting of Magna Charta. The open beams had been hand-adzed at Jake\n      Offutt's car-body works, the hinge; were of hand-wrought iron, the\n      wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs, and at one end of the room was\n      a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which the club's\n      advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any of the\n      fireplaces in European castles but of a draught incomparably more\n      scientific. It was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in\n      it.",
                "Half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.\n      Babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including\n      Gunch, Finkelstein, Professor Pumphrey, Howard Littlefield, his neighbor,\n      T. Cholmondeley Frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and Orville Jones,\n      whose laundry was in many ways the best in Zenith. They composed a club\n      within the club, and merrily called themselves \"The Roughnecks.\" To-day as\n      he passed their table the Roughnecks greeted him, \"Come on, sit in! You\n      'n' Paul too proud to feed with poor folks? Afraid somebody might stick\n      you for a bottle of Bevo, George? Strikes me you swells are getting awful\n      darn exclusive!\"",
                "He thundered, \"You bet! We can't afford to have our reps ruined by being\n      seen with you tightwads!\" and guided Paul to one of the small tables\n      beneath the musicians'-gallery. He felt guilty. At the Zenith Athletic\n      Club, privacy was very bad form. But he wanted Paul to himself.",
                "That morning he had advocated lighter lunches and now he ordered nothing\n      but English mutton chop, radishes, peas, deep-dish apple pie, a bit of\n      cheese, and a pot of coffee with cream, adding, as he did invariably, \"And\n      uh -- Oh, and you might give me an order of French fried potatoes.\"\n       When the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. He always\n      peppered and salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.",
                "Paul and he took up the spring-like quality of the spring, the virtues of\n      the electric cigar-lighter, and the action of the New York State Assembly.\n      It was not till Babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton grease that\n      he flung out:",
                "\"I wound up a nice little deal with Conrad Lyte this morning that put five\n      hundred good round plunks in my pocket. Pretty nice -- pretty nice! And\n      yet -- I don't know what's the matter with me to-day. Maybe it's an\n      attack of spring fever, or staying up too late at Verg Gunch's, or maybe\n      it's just the winter's work piling up, but I've felt kind of down in the\n      mouth all day long. Course I wouldn't beef about it to the fellows at the\n      Roughnecks' Table there, but you -- Ever feel that way, Paul? Kind of\n      comes over me: here I've pretty much done all the things I ought to;\n      supported my family, and got a good house and a six-cylinder car, and\n      built up a nice little business, and I haven't any vices 'specially,\n      except smoking -- and I'm practically cutting that out, by the way. And\n      I belong to the church, and play enough golf to keep in trim, and I only\n      associate with good decent fellows. And yet, even so, I don't know that\n      I'm entirely satisfied!\"",

                "\"Good Lord, George, you don't suppose it's any novelty to me to find that\n      we hustlers, that think we're so all-fired successful, aren't getting much\n      out of it? You look as if you expected me to report you as seditious! You\n      know what my own life's been.\"",

Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her,\n      feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and\n      ready to be the next let in.

                "HE forgot Paul Riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable details. After\n      a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on without him, he\n      drove a \"prospect\" out to view a four-flat tenement in the Linton\n      district. He was inspired by the customer's admiration of the new\n      cigar-lighter. Thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled\n      half-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, \"I GOT to quit smoking so\n      blame much!\"",
                "Their ample discussion of every detail of the cigar-lighter led them to\n      speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being\n      so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and he\n      announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had\n      enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all\n      mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding\n      each new intricate mechanism -- metal lathe, two-jet carburetor,\n      machine gun, oxyacetylene welder -- he learned one good\n      realistic-sounding phrase, and used it over and over, with a delightful\n      feeling of being technical and initiated.",
                "The customer joined him in the worship of machinery, and they came\n      buoyantly up to the tenement and began that examination of plastic slate\n      roof, kalamein doors, and seven-eighths-inch blind-nailed flooring, began\n      those diplomacies of hurt surprise and readiness to be persuaded to do\n      something they had already decided to do, which would some day result in a\n      sale.",
                "On the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T.\n      Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South\n      Zenith, a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of hollow\n      tile with gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick factories\n      stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks like\n      locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering\n      freight-cars from the New York Central and apple orchards, the Great\n      Northern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific and orange groves.",
                "They talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an\n      interesting artistic project -- a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane\n      Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the\n      sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson.\n      Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no\n      Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without\n      receiving a discount. But Henry Thompson growled, \"Oh, t' hell with 'em!\n      I'm not going to crawl around mooching discounts, not from nobody.\" It was\n      one of the differences between Thompson, the old-fashioned, lean Yankee,\n      rugged, traditional, stage type of American business man, and Babbitt, the\n      plump, smooth, efficient, up-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern.\n      Whenever Thompson twanged, \"Put your John Hancock on that line,\" Babbitt\n      was as much amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper\n      Englishman by any American. He knew himself to be of a breeding altogether\n      more esthetic and sensitive than Thompson's. He was a college graduate, he\n      played golf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he\n      went to Chicago he took a room with a private bath. \"The whole thing is,\"\n       he explained to Paul Riesling, \"these old codgers lack the subtlety that\n      you got to have to-day.\"",
                "This advance in civilization could be carried too far, Babbitt perceived.\n      Noel Ryland, sales-manager of the Zeeco, was a frivolous graduate of\n      Princeton, while Babbitt was a sound and standard ware from that great\n      department-store, the State University. Ryland wore spats, he wrote long\n      letters about City Planning and Community Singing, and, though he was a\n      Booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small volumes of poetry in a\n      foreign language. All this was going too far. Henry Thompson was the\n      extreme of insularity, and Noel Ryland the extreme of frothiness, while\n      between them, supporting the state, defending the evangelical churches and\n      domestic brightness and sound business, were Babbitt and his friends.",
                "With this just estimate of himself -- and with the promise of a\n      discount on Thompson's car -- he returned to his office in triumph.",
                "But as he went through the corridor of the Reeves Building he sighed,\n      \"Poor old Paul! I got to -- Oh, damn Noel Ryland! Damn Charley\n      McKelvey! Just because they make more money than I do, they think they're\n      so superior. I wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old Union Club!

He had been a ponderous debater in\n      college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor\n      of the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He\n      saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The\n      lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study\n      violin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by\n      Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and\n      gaily wagging finger.",
                "Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's\n      second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her\n      capacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was\n      going to be governor some day. Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy,\n      Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young\n      dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith -- an ancient\n      settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred\n      thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the\n      Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he\n      was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith.",
                "Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study\n      law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl -- one\n      didn't kiss her, one didn't \"think about her that way at all\" unless one\n      was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always\n      ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the\n      great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend\n      against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the\n      inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.",
                "One evening when he was weary and soft-minded, he saw that she had been\n      weeping. She had been left out of a party given by Zilla. Somehow her head\n      was on his shoulder and he was kissing away the tears -- and she raised\n      her head to say trustingly, \"Now that we're engaged, shall we be married\n      soon or shall we wait?\"",
                "Engaged? It was his first hint of it. His affection for this brown tender\n      woman thing went cold and fearful, but he could not hurt her, could not\n      abuse her trust. He mumbled something about waiting, and escaped. He\n      walked for an hour, trying to find a way of telling her that it was a\n      mistake. Often, in the month after, he got near to telling her, but it was\n      pleasant to have a girl in his arms, and less and less could he insult her\n      by blurting that he didn't love her. He himself had no doubt. The evening\n      before his marriage was an agony, and the morning wild with the desire to\n      flee.",
                "She made him what is known as a Good Wife. She was loyal, industrious, and\n      at rare times merry. She passed from a feeble disgust at their closer\n      relations into what promised to be ardent affection, but it drooped into\n      bored routine. Yet she existed only for him and for the children, and she\n      was as sorry, as worried as himself, when he gave up the law and trudged\n      on in a rut of listing real estate.",
                "\"Poor kid, she hasn't had much better time than I have,\" Babbitt\n      reflected, standing in the dark sun-parlor. \"But -- I wish I could 've\n      had a whirl at law and politics. Seen what I could do. Well -- Maybe\n      I've made more money as it is.\"",

                "It was a room which observed the best Floral Heights standards. The gray\n      walls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of white-enameled\n      pine. From the Babbitts' former house had come two much-carved\n      rocking-chairs, but the other chairs were new, very deep and restful,\n      upholstered in blue and gold-striped velvet. A blue velvet davenport faced\n      the fireplace, and behind it was a cherrywood table and a tall piano-lamp\n      with a shade of golden silk. (Two out of every three houses in Floral\n      Heights had before the fireplace a davenport, a mahogany table real or\n      imitation, and a piano-lamp or a reading-lamp with a shade of yellow or\n      rose silk.)",
                "On the table was a runner of gold-threaded Chinese fabric, four magazines,\n      a silver box containing cigarette-crumbs, and three \"gift-books\" -- large,\n      expensive editions of fairy-tales illustrated by English artists and as\n      yet unread by any Babbitt save Tinka.",
                "In a corner by the front windows was a large cabinet Victrola. (Eight out\n      of every nine Floral Heights houses had a cabinet phonograph.)",
                "Among the pictures, hung in the exact center of each gray panel, were a\n      red and black imitation English hunting-print, an anemic imitation\n      boudoir-print with a French caption of whose morality Babbitt had always\n      been rather suspicious, and a \"hand-colored\" photograph of a Colonial room -- rag\n      rug, maiden spinning, cat demure before a white fireplace. (Nineteen out\n      of every twenty houses in Floral Heights had either a hunting-print, a\n      Madame Feit la Toilette print, a colored photograph of a New England\n      house, a photograph of a Rocky Mountain, or all four.)",
                "It was a room as superior in comfort to the \"parlor\" of Babbitt's boyhood\n      as his motor was superior to his father's buggy. Though there was nothing\n      in the room that was interesting, there was nothing that was offensive. It\n      was as neat, and as negative, as a block of artificial ice. The fireplace\n      was unsoftened by downy ashes or by sooty brick; the brass fire-irons were\n      of immaculate polish; and the grenadier andirons were like samples in a\n      shop, desolate, unwanted, lifeless things of commerce.",

                "He had a number of titillations out of concealing the gin-bottle under his\n      coat and out of hiding it in his desk. All afternoon he snorted and\n      chuckled and gurgled over his ability to \"give the Boys a real shot in the\n      arm to-night.\" He was, in fact, so exhilarated that he was within a block\n      of his house before he remembered that there was a certain matter,\n      mentioned by his wife, of fetching ice cream from Vecchia's.

Babbitt felt heavy and thick\n      amid this professional daintiness, and as he waited for the ice cream he\n      decided, with hot prickles at the back of his neck, that a girl customer\n      was giggling at him.

                "With a jar Babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed by\n      that moral indignation with which males rule the world, and he went humbly\n      up-stairs to dress. He had an impression of a glorified dining-room, of\n      cut-glass, candles, polished wood, lace, silver, roses. With the awed\n      swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as giving a dinner,\n      he slew the temptation to wear his plaited dress-shirt for a fourth time,\n      took out an entirely fresh one, tightened his black bow, and rubbed his\n      patent-leather pumps with a handkerchief. He glanced with pleasure at his\n      garnet and silver studs. He smoothed and patted his ankles, transformed by\n      silk socks from the sturdy shanks of George Babbitt to the elegant limbs\n      of what is called a Clubman. He stood before the pier-glass, viewing his\n      trim dinner-coat, his beautiful triple-braided trousers; and murmured in\n      lyric beatitude, \"By golly, I don't look so bad. I certainly don't look\n      like Catawba. If the hicks back home could see me in this rig, they'd have\n      a fit!\"",

As he chipped ice, as he\n      squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses, and\n      spoons at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the\n      bartender at Healey Hanson's saloon. True, Mrs. Babbitt said he was under\n      foot, and Matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by him,\n      elbowed him, shrieked \"Pleasopn door,\" as they tottered through with\n      trays, but in this high moment he ignored them.",
                "Besides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle of\n      Bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of Italian vermouth, and\n      approximately one hundred drops of orange bitters. He did not possess a\n      cocktail-shaker. A shaker was proof of dissipation, the symbol of a\n      Drinker, and Babbitt disliked being known as a Drinker even more than he\n      liked a Drink. He mixed by pouring from an ancient gravy-boat into a\n      handleless pitcher; he poured with a noble dignity, holding his alembics\n      high beneath the powerful Mazda globe, his face hot, his shirt-front a\n      glaring white, the copper sink a scoured red-gold.",
                "He tasted the sacred essence. \"Now, by golly, if that isn't pretty near\n      one fine old cocktail! Kind of a Bronx, and yet like a Manhattan. Ummmmmm!\n      Hey, Myra, want a little nip before the folks come?\"",
                "Bustling into the dining-room, moving each glass a quarter of an inch,\n      rushing back with resolution implacable on her face her gray and\n      silver-lace party frock protected by a denim towel, Mrs. Babbitt glared at\n      him, and rebuked him, \"Certainly not!\"",
                "\"Well,\" in a loose, jocose manner, \"I think the old man will!\"",
                "The cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was\n      aware of devastating desires -- to rush places in fast motors, to kiss\n      girls, to sing, to be witty. He sought to regain his lost dignity by\n      announcing to Matilda:",

His voice was thin and distant. \"Whee!\"\n       With enormous impressiveness he commanded, \"Well, be sure now,\" and minced\n      into the safety of the living-room. He wondered whether he could persuade\n      \"as slow a bunch as Myra and the Littlefields to go some place aft' dinner\n      and raise Cain and maybe dig up smore booze.\" He perceived that he had\n      gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.",
                "By the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple for\n      whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray emptiness had\n      replaced the purple swirling in Babbitt's head, and he had to force the\n      tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on Floral Heights.",
                "The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished\n      publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil\n      Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters'\n      Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across\n      the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which\n      justly announced itself \"the biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe\n      in Zenith.\" But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T.\n      Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the author of \"Poemulations,\" which,\n      syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the\n      largest audiences of any poet in the world, but also an optimistic\n      lecturer and the creator of \"Ads that Add.\" Despite the searching\n      philosophy and high morality of his verses, they were humorous and easily\n      understood by any child of twelve; and it added a neat air of pleasantry\n      to them that they were set not as verse but as prose. Mr. Frink was known\n      from Coast to Coast as \"Chum.\"",
                "With them were six wives, more or less -- it was hard to tell, so early\n      in the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all\n      said, \"Oh, ISN'T this nice!\" in the same tone of determined liveliness. To\n      the eye, the men were less similar: Littlefield, a hedge-scholar, tall and\n      horse-faced; Chum Frink, a trifle of a man with soft and mouse-like hair,\n      advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on his eye-glasses;\n      Vergil Gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse; Eddie Swanson, a\n      bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste for elegance by an\n      evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass buttons; Orville Jones,\n      a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable person, with a hemp-colored\n      toothbrush mustache. Yet they were all so well fed and clean, they all\n      shouted \"'Evenin', Georgie!\" with such robustness, that they seemed to be\n      cousins, and the strange thing is that the longer one knew the women, the\n      less alike they seemed; while the longer one knew the men, the more alike\n      their bold patterns appeared.",
                "The drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The\n      company waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in a strained manner that\n      the weather had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt said\n      nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late couple\n      (the Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, \"Well, folks, do you think you\n      could stand breaking the law a little?\"",
                "They looked at Chum Frink, the recognized lord of language. Frink pulled\n      at his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, he cleared his throat and said\n      that which was the custom:",
                "\"I'll tell you, George: I'm a law-abiding man, but they do say Verg Gunch\n      is a regular yegg, and of course he's bigger 'n I am, and I just can't\n      figure out what I'd do if he tried to force me into anything criminal!\"",
                "Gunch was roaring, \"Well, I'll take a chance -- \" when Frink held up\n      his hand and went on, \"So if Verg and you insist, Georgie, I'll park my\n      car on the wrong side of the street, because I take it for granted that's\n      the crime you're hinting at!\"",
                "There was a great deal of laughter. Mrs. Jones asserted, \"Mr. Frink is\n      simply too killing! You'd think he was so innocent!\"",
                "Babbitt clamored, \"How did you guess it, Chum? Well, you-all just wait a\n      moment while I go out and get the -- keys to your cars!\" Through a\n      froth of merriment he brought the shining promise, the mighty tray of\n      glasses with the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the\n      center. The men babbled, \"Oh, gosh, have a look!\" and \"This gets me right\n      where I live!\" and \"Let me at it!\" But Chum Frink, a traveled man and not\n      unused to woes, was stricken by the thought that the potion might be\n      merely fruit-juice with a little neutral spirits. He looked timorous as\n      Babbitt, a moist and ecstatic almoner, held out a glass, but as he tasted\n      it he piped, \"Oh, man, let me dream on! It ain't true, but don't waken me!\n      Jus' lemme slumber!\"",
                "Two hours before, Frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning:",
                "\"I sat alone and groused and thunk, and scratched my head and sighed and\n      wunk, and groaned, There still are boobs, alack, who'd like the old-time\n      gin-mill back; that den that makes a sage a loon, the vile and smelly old\n      saloon! I'll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the bubbling spring\n      can use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe new-born!\"",
                "Babbitt drank with the others; his moment's depression was gone; he\n      perceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to give\n      them a thousand cocktails. \"Think you could stand another?\" he cried. The\n      wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a wide, elaborate,\n      enjoyable manner, gloated, \"Well, sooner than have you get sore at me,\n      Georgie -- \"",
                "\"You got a little dividend coming,\" said Babbitt to each of them, and each\n      intoned, \"Squeeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!\"",
                "When, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about\n      prohibition. The men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in their\n      trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming profundity\n      of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed statement about a\n      matter of which he knows nothing whatever.",
                "\"Now, I'll tell you,\" said Vergil Gunch; \"way I figure it is this, and I\n      can speak by the book, because I've talked to a lot of doctors and fellows\n      that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it's a good thing to get\n      rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light\n      wines.\"",
                "Howard Littlefield observed, \"What isn't generally realized is that it's a\n      dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty. Now, take\n      this for instance: The King of -- Bavaria? I think it was Bavaria -- yes,\n      Bavaria, it was -- in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a proclamation\n      against public grazing of live-stock. The peasantry had stood for\n      overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this proclamation\n      came out, they rebelled. Or it may have been Saxony. But it just goes to\n      show the dangers of invading the rights of personal liberty.\"",
                "\"That's it -- no one got a right to invade personal liberty,\" said\n      Orville Jones.",
                "\"Just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good\n      thing for the working-classes. Keeps 'em from wasting their money and\n      lowering their productiveness,\" said Vergil Gunch.",
                "\"Yes, that's so. But the trouble is the manner of enforcement,\" insisted\n      Howard Littlefield. \"Congress didn't understand the right system. Now, if\n      I'd been running the thing, I'd have arranged it so that the drinker\n      himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless\n      workman -- kept him from drinking -- and yet not 've interfered with\n      the rights -- with the personal liberty -- of fellows like\n      ourselves.\"",
                "They bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,\n      \"That's so, that would be the stunt.\"",
                "\"The thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to\n      cocaine,\" sighed Eddie Swanson.",
                "They bobbed more violently, and groaned, \"That's so, there is a danger of\n      that.\"",
                "Chum Frink chanted, \"Oh, say, I got hold of a swell new receipt for\n      home-made beer the other day. You take -- \"",
                "Gunch interrupted, \"Wait! Let me tell you mine!\" Littlefield snorted,\n      \"Beer! Rats! Thing to do is to ferment cider!\" Jones insisted, \"I've got\n      the receipt that does the business!\" Swanson begged, \"Oh, say, lemme tell\n      you the story -- \" But Frink went on resolutely, \"You take and save the\n      shells from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of shells and\n      boil the mixture till -- \"",
                "Mrs. Babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; Frink hastened to\n      finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, \"Dinner is served.\"",
                "There was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which\n      should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the\n      living-room to the dining-room Vergil Gunch made them laugh by thundering,\n      \"If I can't sit next to Myra Babbitt and hold her hand under the table, I\n      won't play -- I'm goin' home.\" In the dining-room they stood\n      embarrassed while Mrs. Babbitt fluttered, \"Now, let me see -- Oh, I was\n      going to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but -- Oh, let\n      me see; Mr. Frink, you sit there.\"",
                "The dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the\n      salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible\n      fried chicken resembled something else. Ordinarily the men found it hard\n      to talk to the women; flirtation was an art unknown on Floral Heights, and\n      the realms of offices and of kitchens had no alliances. But under the\n      inspiration of the cocktails, conversation was violent. Each of the men\n      still had a number of important things to say about prohibition, and now\n      that each had a loyal listener in his dinner-partner he burst out:",
                "\"I found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a quart -- \"",
                "\"Did you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for\n      ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this\n      fellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him -- \"",
                "\"They say there's a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at Detroit -- \"",
                "\"What I always say is -- what a lot of folks don't realize about\n      prohibition -- \"",
                "\"And then you get all this awful poison stuff -- wood alcohol and\n      everything -- \"",
                "\"Course I believe in it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody\n      telling me what I got to think and do. No American 'll ever stand for\n      that!\"",
                "But they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for Orville Jones -- and\n      he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anyway -- to say,\n      \"In fact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn't the initial\n      cost, it's the humidity.\"",
                "Not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation\n      become general.",
                "It was often and admiringly said of Vergil Gunch, \"Gee, that fellow can\n      get away with murder! Why, he can pull a Raw One in mixed company and all\n      the ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if I crack anything\n      that's just the least bit off color I get the razz for fair!\" Now Gunch\n      delighted them by crying to Mrs. Eddie Swanson, youngest of the women,\n      \"Louetta! I managed to pinch Eddie's doorkey out of his pocket, and what\n      say you and me sneak across the street when the folks aren't looking? Got\n      something,\" with a gorgeous leer, \"awful important to tell you!\"",
                "The women wriggled, and Babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. \"Say,\n      folks, I wished I dared show you a book I borrowed from Doc Patten!\"",

                "\"This book -- racy isn't the word! It's some kind of an anthropological\n      report about -- about Customs, in the South Seas, and what it doesn't\n      SAY! It's a book you can't buy. Verg, I'll lend it to you.\"",
                "\"Me first!\" insisted Eddie Swanson. \"Sounds spicy!\"",
                "Orville Jones announced, \"Say, I heard a Good One the other day about a\n      coupla Swedes and their wives,\" and, in the best Jewish accent, he\n      resolutely carried the Good One to a slightly disinfected ending. Gunch\n      capped it. But the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into cautious\n      reality.",
                "Chum Frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns, and\n      he chuckled, \"Awful good to get back to civilization! I certainly been\n      seeing some hick towns! I mean -- Course the folks there are the best\n      on earth, but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you fellows\n      can't hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of live\n      ones!\"",
                "\"You bet!\" exulted Orville Jones. \"They're the best folks on earth, those\n      small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they can't\n      talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by heckalorum!\"",
                "\"That's right. They all talk about just the same things,\" said Eddie\n      Swanson.",
                "\"Don't they, though! They just say the same things over and over,\" said\n      Vergil Gunch.",
                "\"Yes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at\n      things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about\n      Fords and the weather and so on.\" said Howard Littlefield.",
                "\"Still, at that, you can't blame 'em. They haven't got any intellectual\n      stimulus such as you get up here in the city,\" said Chum Frink.",
                "\"Gosh, that's right,\" said Babbitt. \"I don't want you highbrows to get\n      stuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes\n      to sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in\n      economics! But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to talk\n      to, no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech, and so\n      balled-up in their thinking!\"",
                "Orville Jones commented, \"And, then take our other advantages -- the\n      movies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they're all-get-out if\n      they have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your\n      choice of a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!\"",
                "\"Sure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class\n      hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger,\" said Eddie Swanson.",
                "\"Same time,\" said Babbitt, \"no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy.\n      Fellow's own fault if he doesn't show the initiative to up and beat it to\n      the city, like we done -- did. And, just speaking in confidence among\n      friends, they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to\n      Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up\n      with because I've more or less succeeded and they haven't. And if you talk\n      natural to 'em, way we do here, and show finesse and what you might call a\n      broad point of view, why, they think you're putting on side. There's my\n      own half-brother Martin -- runs the little ole general store my Dad\n      used to keep. Say, I'll bet he don't know there is such a thing as a Tux -- as\n      a dinner-jacket. If he was to come in here now, he'd think we were a bunch\n      of -- of -- Why, gosh, I swear, he wouldn't know what to think! Yes,\n      sir, they're jealous!\"",
                "Chum Frink agreed, \"That's so. But what I mind is their lack of culture\n      and appreciation of the Beautiful -- if you'll excuse me for being\n      highbrow. Now, I like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my\n      best poetry -- not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. But\n      say, when I get out in the tall grass, there's nothing will take but a lot\n      of cheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge\n      in it here, he'd get the gate so fast it would make his head swim.\"",
                "Vergil Gunch summed it up: \"Fact is, we're mighty lucky to be living among\n      a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and business-punch\n      equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg\n      and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of life we're used to\n      here. But, by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small\n      American town is trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a\n      lot of 'em don't put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads,\n      telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street,\n      count 'em, one, and nine hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in\n      1920, and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a first-class\n      ladies' ready-to-wear shop -- real perfection, in fact! You don't want to\n      just look at what these small towns are, you want to look at what they're\n      aiming to become, and they all got an ambition that in the long run is\n      going to make 'em the finest spots on earth -- they all want to be just\n      like Zenith!\"",

They\n      worked perhaps two hours a day, and the rest of the time they ate\n      chocolates, went to the motion-pictures, went window-shopping, went in\n      gossiping twos and threes to card-parties, read magazines, thought\n      timorously of the lovers who never appeared, and accumulated a splendid\n      restlessness which they got rid of by nagging their husbands.

Suddenly,\n      without precedent, Babbitt was not merely bored but admitting that he was\n      bored.

Mrs. Gunch squeaked, and they jumped with unnatural\n      jocularity, but at Frink's hiss they sank into subdued awe. Suddenly,\n      incredibly, they heard a knocking. They stared at Frink's half-revealed\n      hands and found them lying still. They wriggled, and pretended not to be\n      impressed.",
                "Frink spoke with gravity: \"Is some one there?\" A thud. \"Is one knock to be\n      the sign for 'yes'?\" A thud. \"And two for 'no'?\" A thud.",

                "\"Sure -- the fellow that took the Cook's Tour to Hell. I've never waded\n      through his po'try, but we learned about him in the U.,\" said Babbitt.",
                "\"Page Mr. Dannnnnty!\" intoned Eddie Swanson.",
                "\"You ought to get him easy, Mr. Frink, you and he being fellow-poets,\"\n       said Louetta Swanson.",

Where d' you get that stuff?\" protested Vergil Gunch.\n      \"I suppose Dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer -- not that\n      I've actually read him, of course -- but to come right down to hard\n      facts, he wouldn't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to\n      practical literature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every\n      day, like Chum does!\"",

                "\"You forgot to give um the address: 1658 Brimstone Avenue, Fiery Heights,\n      Hell,\" Gunch chuckled, but the others felt that this was irreligious. And\n      besides -- \"probably it was just Chum making the knocks, but still, if\n      there did happen to be something to all this, be exciting to talk to an\n      old fellow belonging to -- way back in early times -- \"",

                "\"We are very happy on the higher plane, Signor. We are glad that you are\n      studying this great truth of spiritualism,\" Dante replied.",

                "Babbitt had a different worry. \"Suppose Chum Frink was really one of these\n      spiritualists! Chum had, for a literary fellow, always seemed to be a\n      Regular Guy; he belonged to the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church and went\n      to the Boosters' lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy stories. But\n      suppose that secretly -- After all, you never could tell about these\n      darn highbrows; and to be an out-and-out spiritualist would be almost like\n      being a socialist!\"",

Mrs. Jones shrieked, and Eddie\n      Swanson desired to know whether Dante didn't catch cold with nothing on\n      but his wreath.",
                "The pleased Dante made humble answer.",
                "But Babbitt -- the curst discontent was torturing him again, and\n      heavily, in the impersonal darkness, he pondered, \"I don't -- We're all\n      so flip and think we're so smart.

                "He had, without explanation, the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it,\n      in silhouette against menacing clouds, a lone and austere figure. He was\n      dismayed by a sudden contempt for his surest friends. He grasped Louetta\n      Swanson's hand, and found the comfort of human warmth. Habit came, a\n      veteran warrior; and he shook himself. \"What the deuce is the matter with\n      me, this evening?\"",
                "He patted Louetta's hand, to indicate that he hadn't meant anything\n      improper by squeezing it, and demanded of Frink, \"Say, see if you can get\n      old Dant' to spiel us some of his poetry. Talk up to him. Tell him, 'Buena\n      giorna, senor, com sa va, wie geht's? Keskersaykersa a little pome,\n      senor?'\"",

He had -- there was something he wished to think\n      out -- But the psychical research had started them off again. (\"Why\n      didn't they go home! Why didn't they go home!\") Though he was impressed by\n      the profundity of the statement, he was only half-enthusiastic when Howard\n      Littlefield lectured, \"The United States is the only nation in which the\n      government is a Moral Ideal and not just a social arrangement.\" (\"True -- true -- weren't\n      they EVER going home?\") He was usually delighted to have an \"inside view\"\n       of the momentous world of motors but to-night he scarcely listened to\n      Eddie Swanson's revelation: \"If you want to go above the Javelin class,\n      the Zeeco is a mighty good buy.

As the door\n      closed he yawned voluptuously, chest out, shoulders wriggling, and turned\n      cynically to his wife.",

Why don't you get Paul to go along, and you boys just\n      fish and have a good time?\" She patted his shoulder -- reaching up to\n      it -- while he shook with palsied helplessness, and in that moment was\n      not merely by habit fond of her but clung to her strength.",
                "She cried cheerily, \"Now up-stairs you go, and pop into bed. We'll fix it\n      all up. I'll see to the doors. Now skip!\"",
                "For many minutes, for many hours, for a bleak eternity, he lay awake,\n      shivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won\n      freedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so\n      embarrassing as freedom."

By sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms were\n      converted into living-rooms. The kitchens were cupboards each containing\n      an electric range, a copper sink, a glass refrigerator, and, very\n      intermittently, a Balkan maid. Everything about the Arms was excessively\n      modern, and everything was compressed -- except the garages.",
                "The Babbitts were calling on the Rieslings at the Arms. It was a\n      speculative venture to call on the Rieslings; interesting and sometimes\n      disconcerting. Zilla was an active, strident, full-blown, high-bosomed\n      blonde. When she condescended to be good-humored she was nervously\n      amusing. Her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of\n      accepted hypocrisies. \"That's so!\" you said, and looked sheepish. She\n      danced wildly, and called on the world to be merry, but in the midst of it\n      she would turn indignant. She was always becoming indignant. Life was a\n      plot against her and she exposed it furiously.",
                "She was affable to-night. She merely hinted that Orville Jones wore a\n      toupe, that Mrs. T. Cholmondeley Frink's singing resembled a Ford going\n      into high, and that the Hon. Otis Deeble, mayor of Zenith and candidate\n      for Congress, was a flatulent fool (which was quite true). The Babbitts\n      and Rieslings sat doubtfully on stone-hard brocade chairs in the small\n      living-room of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace, and\n      its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till Mrs.\n      Riesling shrieked, \"Come on! Let's put some pep in it! Get out your\n      fiddle, Paul, and I'll try to make Georgie dance decently.\"",

They were plotting for the escape to Maine.\n      But when Mrs. Babbitt hinted with plump smilingness, \"Does Paul get as\n      tired after the winter's work as Georgie does?\" then Zilla remembered an\n      injury; and when Zilla Riesling remembered an injury the world stopped\n      till something had been done about it.",

And me, I get the credit for being a\n      terrible old crank, but if I didn't blow up once in a while and get\n      something started, we'd die of dry-rot.

                "At this exposure of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of\n      impassivity. He rubbed his fingers. His hands twitched.",

                "From a rough wharf on the North River they stared at the stern of the\n      Aquitania and her stacks and wireless antenna lifted above the dock-house\n      which shut her in.",
                "\"By golly,\" Babbitt droned, \"wouldn't be so bad to go over to the Old\n      Country and take a squint at all these ruins, and the place where\n      Shakespeare was born. And think of being able to order a drink whenever\n      you wanted one! Just range up to a bar and holler out loud, 'Gimme a\n      cocktail, and darn the police!' Not bad at all. What juh like to see, over\n      there, Paulibus?\"",
                "Paul did not answer. Babbitt turned. Paul was standing with clenched\n      fists, head drooping, staring at the liner as in terror. His thin body,\n      seen against the summer-glaring planks of the wharf, was childishly\n      meager.",
                "Again, \"What would you hit for on the other side, Paul?\"",
                "Scowling at the steamer, his breast heaving, Paul whispered, \"Oh, my God!\"\n       While Babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped, \"Come on, let's get out of\n      this,\" and hastened down the wharf, not looking back.",
                "\"That's funny,\" considered Babbitt. \"The boy didn't care for seeing the\n      ocean boats after all. I thought he'd be interested in 'em.\"",
                "II",
                "Though he exulted, and made sage speculations about locomotive\n      horse-power, as their train climbed the Maine mountain-ridge and from the\n      summit he looked down the shining way among the pines; though he remarked,\n      \"Well, by golly!\" when he discovered that the station at Katadumcook, the\n      end of the line, was an aged freight-car; Babbitt's moment of impassioned\n      release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on Lake Sunasquam, awaiting the\n      launch from the hotel. A raft had floated down the lake; between the logs\n      and the shore, the water was transparent, thin-looking, flashing with\n      minnows. A guide in black felt hat with trout-flies in the band, and\n      flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue, sat on a log and whittled and\n      was silent. A dog, a good country dog, black and woolly gray, a dog rich\n      in leisure and in meditation, scratched and grunted and slept. The thick\n      sunlight was lavish on the bright water, on the rim of gold-green balsam\n      boughs, the silver birches and tropic ferns, and across the lake it burned\n      on the sturdy shoulders of the mountains. Over everything was a holy\n      peace.",
                "Silent, they loafed on the edge of the wharf, swinging their legs above\n      the water. The immense tenderness of the place sank into Babbitt, and he\n      murmured, \"I'd just like to sit here -- the rest of my life -- and\n      whittle -- and sit. And never hear a typewriter. Or Stan Graff fussing\n      in the 'phone. Or Rone and Ted scrapping. Just sit. Gosh!\"",
                "He patted Paul's shoulder. \"How does it strike you, old snoozer?\"",
                "\"Oh, it's darn good, Georgie. There's something sort of eternal about it.\"",
                "For once, Babbitt understood him.",
                "III",
                "Their launch rounded the bend; at the head of the lake, under a mountain\n      slope, they saw the little central dining-shack of their hotel and the\n      crescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms. They landed, and\n      endured the critical examination of the habitues who had been at the hotel\n      for a whole week. In their cottage, with its high stone fireplace, they\n      hastened, as Babbitt expressed it, to \"get into some regular he-togs.\"\n       They came out; Paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt; Babbitt in\n      khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers. It was excessively new\n      khaki; his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office; and his face was\n      not tanned but a city pink. He made a discordant noise in the place. But\n      with infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and crowed, \"Say, this is\n      getting back home, eh?\"",
                "They stood on the wharf before the hotel. He winked at Paul and drew from\n      his back pocket a plug of chewing-tobacco, a vulgarism forbidden in the\n      Babbitt home. He took a chew, beaming and wagging his head as he tugged at\n      it. \"Um! Um! Maybe I haven't been hungry for a wad of eating-tobacco! Have\n      some?\"",
                "They looked at each other in a grin of understanding. Paul took the plug,\n      gnawed at it. They stood quiet, their jaws working. They solemnly spat,\n      one after the other, into the placid water. They stretched voluptuously,\n      with lifted arms and arched backs. From beyond the mountains came the\n      shuffling sound of a far-off train. A trout leaped, and fell back in a\n      silver circle. They sighed together.",
                "IV",
                "They had a week before their families came. Each evening they planned to\n      get up early and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay abed till\n      the breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious that there were no efficient\n      wives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as they\n      dressed.",
                "Paul was distressingly clean, but Babbitt reveled in a good sound\n      dirtiness, in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. He\n      treasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.",
                "All morning they fished unenergetically, or tramped the dim and\n      aqueous-lighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson\n      bells. They slept all afternoon, and till midnight played stud-poker with\n      the guides. Poker was a serious business to the guides. They did not\n      gossip; they shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity menacing\n      to the \"sports;\" and Joe Paradise, king of guides, was sarcastic to\n      loiterers who halted the game even to scratch.",
                "At midnight, as Paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent\n      wet grass, and pine-roots confusing in the darkness, Babbitt rejoiced that\n      he did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all evening.",
                "They did not talk much. The nervous loquacity and opinionation of the\n      Zenith Athletic Club dropped from them. But when they did talk they\n      slipped into the naive intimacy of college days. Once they drew their\n      canoe up to the bank of Sunasquam Water, a stream walled in by the dense\n      green of the hardhack. The sun roared on the green jungle but in the shade\n      was sleepy peace, and the water was golden and rippling. Babbitt drew his\n      hand through the cool flood, and mused:",
                "\"We never thought we'd come to Maine together!\"",
                "\"No. We've never done anything the way we thought we would. I expected to\n      live in Germany with my granddad's people, and study the fiddle.\"",
                "\"That's so. And remember how I wanted to be a lawyer and go into politics?\n      I still think I might have made a go of it. I've kind of got the gift of\n      the gab -- anyway, I can think on my feet, and make some kind of a\n      spiel on most anything, and of course that's the thing you need in\n      politics. By golly, Ted's going to law-school, even if I didn't! Well -- I\n      guess it's worked out all right. Myra's been a fine wife. And Zilla means\n      well, Paulibus.\"",
                "\"Yes. Up here, I figure out all sorts of plans to keep her amused. I kind\n      of feel life is going to be different, now that we're getting a good rest\n      and can go back and start over again.\"",
                "\"I hope so, old boy.\" Shyly: \"Say, gosh, it's been awful nice to sit\n      around and loaf and gamble and act regular, with you along, you old\n      horse-thief!\"",
                "\"Well, you know what it means to me, Georgie. Saved my life.\"",
                "The shame of emotion overpowered them; they cursed a little, to prove they\n      were good rough fellows; and in a mellow silence, Babbitt whistling while\n      Paul hummed, they paddled back to the hotel.",
                "V",
                "Though it was Paul who had seemed overwrought, Babbitt who had been the\n      protecting big brother, Paul became clear-eyed and merry, while Babbitt\n      sank into irritability. He uncovered layer on layer of hidden weariness.\n      At first he had played nimble jester to Paul and for him sought\n      amusements; by the end of the week Paul was nurse, and Babbitt accepted\n      favors with the condescension one always shows a patient nurse.",
                "The day before their families arrived, the women guests at the hotel\n      bubbled, \"Oh, isn't it nice! You must be so excited;\" and the proprieties\n      compelled Babbitt and Paul to look excited. But they went to bed early and\n      grumpy.",
                "When Myra appeared she said at once, \"Now, we want you boys to go on\n      playing around just as if we weren't here.\"",
                "The first evening, he stayed out for poker with the guides, and she said\n      in placid merriment, \"My! You're a regular bad one!\" The second evening,\n      she groaned sleepily, \"Good heavens, are you going to be out every single\n      night?\" The third evening, he didn't play poker.",
                "He was tired now in every cell. \"Funny! Vacation doesn't seem to have done\n      me a bit of good,\" he lamented. \"Paul's frisky as a colt, but I swear, I'm\n      crankier and nervouser than when I came up here.\"",
                "He had three weeks of Maine. At the end of the second week he began to\n      feel calm, and interested in life. He planned an expedition to climb\n      Sachem Mountain, and wanted to camp overnight at Box Car Pond. He was\n      curiously weak, yet cheerful, as though he had cleansed his veins of\n      poisonous energy and was filling them with wholesome blood.",
                "He ceased to be irritated by Ted's infatuation with a waitress (his\n      seventh tragic affair this year); he played catch with Ted, and with pride\n      taught him to cast a fly in the pine-shadowed silence of Skowtuit Pond.",
                "At the end he sighed, \"Hang it, I'm just beginning to enjoy my vacation.\n      But, well, I feel a lot better. And it's going to be one great year! Maybe\n      the Real Estate Board will elect me president, instead of some fuzzy\n      old-fashioned faker like Chan Mott.\"",
                "On the way home, whenever he went into the smoking-compartment he felt\n      guilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty,\n      but each time he triumphed, \"Oh, this is going to be a great year, a great\n      old year!\""

                "ALL the way home from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was a changed\n      man. He was converted to serenity. He was going to cease worrying about\n      business. He was going to have more \"interests\" -- theaters, public\n      affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar,\n      he was going to stop smoking.",
                "He invented a new and perfect method. He would buy no tobacco; he would\n      depend on borrowing it; and, of course, he would be ashamed to borrow\n      often. In a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigar-case out of the\n      smoking-compartment window. He went back and was kind to his wife about\n      nothing in particular; he admired his own purity, and decided, \"Absolutely\n      simple. Just a matter of will-power.\" He started a magazine serial about a\n      scientific detective. Ten miles on, he was conscious that he desired to\n      smoke. He ducked his head, like a turtle going into its shell; he appeared\n      uneasy; he skipped two pages in his story and didn't know it. Five miles\n      later, he leaped up and sought the porter. \"Say, uh, George, have you got\n      a -- \" The porter looked patient. \"Have you got a time-table?\" Babbitt\n      finished. At the next stop he went out and bought a cigar. Since it was to\n      be his last before he reached Zenith, he finished it down to an inch stub.",
                "Four days later he again remembered that he had stopped smoking, but he\n      was too busy catching up with his office-work to keep it remembered.",
                "II",
                "Baseball, he determined, would be an excellent hobby. \"No sense a man's\n      working his fool head off. I'm going out to the Game three times a week.\n      Besides, fellow ought to support the home team.\"",
                "He did go and support the team, and enhance the glory of Zenith, by\n      yelling \"Attaboy!\" and \"Rotten!\" He performed the rite scrupulously. He\n      wore a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened\n      his mouth in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He\n      went to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on\n      watching the Advocate-Times bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and\n      steamiest of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded\n      the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to\n      complete strangers, \"Pretty nice! Good work!\" and hastened back to the\n      office.",
                "He honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn't, in\n      twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch with\n      Ted -- very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes. But the game\n      was a custom of his clan, and it gave outlet for the homicidal and\n      sides-taking instincts which Babbitt called \"patriotism\" and \"love of\n      sport.\"",
                "As he approached the office he walked faster and faster, muttering, \"Guess\n      better hustle.\" All about him the city was hustling, for hustling's sake.\n      Men in motors were hustling to pass one another in the hustling traffic.\n      Men were hustling to catch trolleys, with another trolley a minute behind,\n      and to leap from the trolleys, to gallop across the sidewalk, to hurl\n      themselves into buildings, into hustling express elevators. Men in dairy\n      lunches were hustling to gulp down the food which cooks had hustled to\n      fry. Men in barber shops were snapping, \"Jus' shave me once over. Gotta\n      hustle.\" Men were feverishly getting rid of visitors in offices adorned\n      with the signs, \"This Is My Busy Day\" and \"The Lord Created the World in\n      Six Days -- You Can Spiel All You Got to Say in Six Minutes.\" Men who\n      had made five thousand, year before last, and ten thousand last year, were\n      urging on nerve-yelping bodies and parched brains so that they might make\n      twenty thousand this year; and the men who had broken down immediately\n      after making their twenty thousand dollars were hustling to catch trains,\n      to hustle through the vacations which the hustling doctors had ordered.",
                "Among them Babbitt hustled back to his office, to sit down with nothing\n      much to do except see that the staff looked as though they were hustling.",
                "III",
                "Every Saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club and hustled\n      through nine holes of golf as a rest after the week's hustle.",
                "In Zenith it was as necessary for a Successful Man to belong to a country\n      club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt's was the Outing Golf and\n      Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad porch, on a\n      daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was another, the\n      Tonawanda Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey, Horace Updike,\n      and the other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic but at the Union\n      Club. Babbitt explained with frequency, \"You couldn't hire me to join the\n      Tonawanda, even if I did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on\n      the initiation fee. At the Outing we've got a bunch of real human fellows,\n      and the finest lot of little women in town -- just as good at joshing\n      as the men -- but at the Tonawanda there's nothing but these would-be's\n      in New York get-ups, drinking tea! Too much dog altogether. Why, I\n      wouldn't join the Tonawanda even if they -- I wouldn't join it on a\n      bet!\"",
                "When he had played four or five holes, he relaxed a bit, his\n      tobacco-fluttering heart beat more normally, and his voice slowed to the\n      drawling of his hundred generations of peasant ancestors.",
                "IV",
                "At least once a week Mr. and Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went to the movies.\n      Their favorite motion-picture theater was the Chateau, which held three\n      thousand spectators and had an orchestra of fifty pieces which played\n      Arrangements from the Operas and suites portraying a Day on the Farm, or a\n      Four-alarm Fire. In the stone rotunda, decorated with crown-embroidered\n      velvet chairs and almost medieval tapestries, parrakeets sat on gilded\n      lotos columns.",
                "With exclamations of \"Well, by golly!\" and \"You got to go some to beat\n      this dump!\" Babbitt admired the Chateau. As he stared across the thousands\n      of heads, a gray plain in the dimness, as he smelled good clothes and mild\n      perfume and chewing-gum, he felt as when he had first seen a mountain and\n      realized how very, very much earth and rock there was in it.",
                "He liked three kinds of films: pretty bathing girls with bare legs;\n      policemen or cowboys and an industrious shooting of revolvers; and funny\n      fat men who ate spaghetti. He chuckled with immense, moist-eyed\n      sentimentality at interludes portraying puppies, kittens, and chubby\n      babies; and he wept at deathbeds and old mothers being patient in\n      mortgaged cottages. Mrs. Babbitt preferred the pictures in which handsome\n      young women in elaborate frocks moved through sets ticketed as the\n      drawing-rooms of New York millionaires. As for Tinka, she preferred, or\n      was believed to prefer, whatever her parents told her to.",

It was\n      to hold its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith's chief rival among the\n      cities of the state. Babbitt was an official delegate; another was Cecil\n      Rountree, whom Babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building,\n      and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest\n      dances on Royal Ridge.

He\n      caught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink looked\n      hunted and evasive, \"Say, Chum -- you're a shark on this writing stuff -- how\n      would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript -- manuscript\n      now where the deuce is that? -- oh, yes, here. Would you say 'We ought\n      not also to alone think?' or 'We ought also not to think alone?' or -- \"",
                "One evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, Babbitt\n      forgot about Style, Order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off what\n      he really thought about the real-estate business and about himself, and he\n      found the paper written. When he read it to his wife she yearned, \"Why,\n      dear, it's splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and interesting,\n      and such splendid ideas! Why, it's just -- it's just splendid!\"",
                "Next day he cornered Chum Frink and crowed, \"Well, old son, I finished it\n      last evening! Just lammed it out! I used to think you writing-guys must\n      have a hard job making up pieces, but Lord, it's a cinch. Pretty soft for\n      you fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! Some day when I get ready\n      to retire, guess I'll take to writing and show you boys how to do it. I\n      always used to think I could write better stuff, and more punch and\n      originality, than all this stuff you see printed, and now I'm doggone sure\n      of it!\"",
                "He had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title,\n      had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to old Ira\n      Runyon, the managing editor of the Advocate-Times, who said yes, indeed\n      yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would read it all\n      through -- as soon as he could find time.",
                "Mrs. Babbitt could not go to Monarch. She had a women's-club meeting.\n      Babbitt said that he was very sorry.",

                "Besides the five official delegates to the convention -- Babbitt,\n      Rountree, W. A. Rogers, Alvin Thayer, and Elbert Wing -- there were\n      fifty unofficial delegates, most of them with their wives.",
                "They met at the Union Station for the midnight train to Monarch. All of\n      them, save Cecil Rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore badges,\n      displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered \"We zoom for\n      Zenith.\" The official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta\n      ribbons. Martin Lumsen's little boy Willy carried a tasseled banner\n      inscribed \"Zenith the Zip City -- Zeal, Zest and Zowie -- 1,000,000\n      in 1935.\" As the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family\n      automobile driven by the oldest son or by Cousin Fred, they formed\n      impromptu processions through the station waiting-room.",
                "It was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and\n      frescoes depicting the exploration of the Chaloosa River Valley by Pere\n      Emile Fauthoux in 1740. The benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany;\n      the news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. Down the echoing spaces\n      of the hall the delegates paraded after Willy Lumsen's banner, the men\n      waving their cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks and strings\n      of beads, all singing to the tune of Auld Lang Syne the official City\n      Song, written by Chum Frink:",
                "Good old Zenith,\n     Our kin and kith,\n     Wherever we may be,\n     Hats in the ring,\n     We blithely sing\n     Of thy Prosperity.",

                "Babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. He leaped on a bench, shouting\n      to the crowd:",
                "\"What's the matter with Zenith?\"",
                "\"She's all right!\"",
                "\"What's best ole town in the U. S. A.?\"",
                "\"Zeeeeeen-ith!\"",
                "The patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious\n      wonder -- Italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes,\n      roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new\n      but which were faded now and wrinkled.",
                "Babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified.\n      With Wing and Rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the\n      waiting Pullmans. Motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters\n      carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity.\n      Arc-lights glared and stammered overhead. The glossy yellow sleeping-cars\n      shone impressively. Babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he\n      thrust out his abdomen and rumbled, \"We got to see to it that the\n      convention lets the Legislature understand just where they get off in this\n      matter of taxing realty transfers.\" Wing uttered approving grunts and\n      Babbitt swelled -- gloated.",
                "The blind of a Pullman compartment was raised, and Babbitt looked into an\n      unfamiliar world. The occupant of the compartment was Lucile McKelvey, the\n      pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. Possibly, Babbitt thrilled, she\n      was going to Europe! On the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and\n      violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed foreign. While he\n      stared, she picked up the book, then glanced out of the window as though\n      she was bored. She must have looked straight at him, and he had met her,\n      but she gave no sign. She languidly pulled down the blind, and he stood\n      still, a cold feeling of insignificance in his heart.",
                "But on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from Sparta,\n      Pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened respectfully\n      when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of Zenith, he explained politics\n      and the value of a Good Sound Business Administration. They fell joyfully\n      into shop-talk, the purest and most rapturous form of conversation:",
                "\"How'd this fellow Rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he was\n      going to put up? Whadde do? Get out bonds to finance it?\" asked a Sparta\n      broker.",

                "\"So,\" Elbert Wing was droning, \"I hired this shop-window for a week, and\n      put up a big sign, 'Toy Town for Tiny Tots,' and stuck in a lot of doll\n      houses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, 'Baby\n      Likes This Dollydale, but Papa and Mama Will Prefer Our Beautiful\n      Bungalows,' and you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first week\n      we sold -- \"",
                "The trucks sang \"lickety-lick, lickety-lick\" as the train ran through the\n      factory district. Furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were clanging.\n      Red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past, and Babbitt\n      was important again, and eager.",
                "IV",
                "He did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the train. In the\n      morning, half an hour before they reached Monarch, the porter came to his\n      berth and whispered, \"There's a drawing-room vacant, sir. I put your suit\n      in there.\" In tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, Babbitt slipped down\n      the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first private\n      compartment. The porter indicated that he knew Babbitt was used to a\n      man-servant; he held the ends of Babbitt's trousers, that the beautifully\n      sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the private\n      washroom, and waited with a towel.",
                "To have a private washroom was luxurious. However enlivening a Pullman\n      smoking-compartment was by night, even to Babbitt it was depressing in the\n      morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts, every hook\n      filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled with dingy\n      toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste.\n      Babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but now he reveled in\n      it, reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a\n      tip of a dollar and a half.",
                "He rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed\n      clothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked at\n      Monarch.",
                "He was to share a room at the Hotel Sedgwick with W. A. Rogers, that\n      shrewd, rustic-looking Zenith dealer in farm-lands. Together they had a\n      noble breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in\n      large pots. Babbitt grew expansive, and told Rogers about the art of\n      writing; he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the\n      lobby, and sent to Tinka a post-card: \"Papa wishes you were here to bat\n      round with him.\"",

He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that\n      he got nothing done whatever. He sat at a marquetry table, in a room\n      littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and\n      lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to\n      him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, \"Yes, yes, that's a fine\n      idea; we'll do that,\" and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar\n      and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him\n      men kept beseeching, \"Say, Mr. Chairman -- say, Mr. Chairman!\" without\n      penetrating his exhausted hearing.",

Perhaps three\n      hundred of them were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred\n      vigorously exclaimed, \"This is pretty slick, eh?\" surreptitiously picked\n      the late asters and concealed them in their pockets, and tried to get near\n      enough to Mrs. Knowlton to shake her lovely hand. Without request, the\n      Zenith delegates (except Rountree) gathered round a marble dancing nymph\n      and sang \"Here we come, the fellows from Zenith, the Zip Citee.\"",

The\n      leader of the Galop de Vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish\n      man, but active.

On the walk, like shredded lovely\n      flesh, were the petals of the last gallant rose. Cigarette stubs floated\n      in the goldfish pool, trailing an evil stain as they swelled and\n      disintegrated, and beneath the marble seat, the fragments carefully put\n      together, was a smashed teacup.",

Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban\n      trolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were\n      given to him, and marveled to his roommate, W. A.

But he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal\n      paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a\n      flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. They shouted\n      \"That's the stuff!\" and in the discussion afterward they referred with\n      impressiveness to \"our friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt.\" He had\n      in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as\n      well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the\n      meeting, delegates from all over the state said, \"Hower you, Brother\n      Babbitt?\" Sixteen complete strangers called him \"George,\" and three men\n      took him into corners to confide, \"Mighty glad you had the courage to\n      stand up and give the Profession a real boost.

                "THIS autumn a Mr. W. G. Harding, of Marion, Ohio, was appointed President\n      of the United States, but Zenith was less interested in the national\n      campaign than in the local election. Seneca Doane, though he was a lawyer\n      and a graduate of the State University, was candidate for mayor of Zenith\n      on an alarming labor ticket. To oppose him the Democrats and Republicans\n      united on Lucas Prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a perfect record for\n      sanity. Mr. Prout was supported by the banks, the Chamber of Commerce, all\n      the decent newspapers, and George F. Babbitt.",
                "Babbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his district was safe\n      and he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper had given him the\n      beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic\n      Central Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to\n      address small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with their\n      new votes. He acquired a fame enduring for weeks. Now and then a reporter\n      was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though they were\n      not very large) indicated that George F. Babbitt had addressed Cheering\n      Throng, and Distinguished Man of Affairs had pointed out the Fallacies of\n      Doane. Once, in the rotogravure section of the Sunday Advocate-Times,\n      there was a photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other business men, with the\n      caption \"Leaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce Who Back Prout.\"",
                "He deserved his glory. He was an excellent campaigner. He had faith; he\n      was certain that if Lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for Mr.\n      W. G. Harding -- unless he came to Zenith and electioneered for Lucas\n      Prout. He did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; Prout represented\n      honest industry, Seneca Doane represented whining laziness, and you could\n      take your choice. With his broad shoulders and vigorous voice, he was\n      obviously a Good Fellow; and, rarest of all, he really liked people. He\n      almost liked common workmen. He wanted them to be well paid, and able to\n      afford high rents -- though, naturally, they must not interfere with\n      the reasonable profits of stockholders. Thus nobly endowed, and keyed high\n      by the discovery that he was a natural orator, he was popular with\n      audiences, and he raged through the campaign, renowned not only in the\n      Seventh and Eighth Wards but even in parts of the Sixteenth.",

                "Crowded in his car, they came driving up to Turnverein Hall, South Zenith -- Babbitt,\n      his wife, Verona, Ted, and Paul and Zilla Riesling.

                "\"Don't know how you keep it up, talking to three bunches in one evening.\n      Wish I had your strength,\" said Paul; and Ted exclaimed to Verona, \"The\n      old man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along!\"",

The hall was full. As Babbitt pushed\n      through the fringe standing at the back, he heard the precious tribute,\n      \"That's him!\" The chairman bustled down the center aisle with an\n      impressive, \"The speaker?

                "Modestly, busily, he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause, and\n      sped off to his third audience of the evening. \"Ted, you better drive,\" he\n      said. \"Kind of all in after that spiel. Well, Paul, how'd it go? Did I get\n      'em?\"",
                "\"Bully! Corking! You had a lot of pep.\"",
                "Mrs. Babbitt worshiped, \"Oh, it was fine! So clear and interesting, and\n      such nice ideas. When I hear you orating I realize I don't appreciate how\n      profoundly you think and what a splendid brain and vocabulary you have.\n      Just -- splendid.\" But Verona was irritating. \"Dad,\" she worried, \"how\n      do you know that public ownership of utilities and so on and so forth will\n      always be a failure?\"",

I'm sure when he's rested he'll\n      be glad to explain it to you. Now let's all be quiet and give Papa a\n      chance to get ready for his next speech. Just think!

                "Neither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club;\n      neither of them had ever called Babbitt \"brother\" or asked his opinions on\n      carburetors. The only \"human people\" whom she invited, Babbitt raged, were\n      the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so statistical\n      that Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch's, \"Well, old\n      lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?\"",
                "Immediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the\n      seven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at\n      four. But they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs.\n      Babbitt scolded, \"Do please try to keep out of the way!\" He stood in the\n      door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or Sam\n      Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted\n      sneaking about the corner of the house.",
                "\"What's the matter, old man?\" said Babbitt.",
                "\"Is that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I told\n      her Rone and I would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta to-night, and\n      she bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say, the Babbitt men\n      will be some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a dress-suit!\"",
                "\"The Babbitt men!\" Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about the\n      boy's shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that Ted\n      might marry her. \"Yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all right,\"\n       he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and dutifully\n      went in to dress.",
                "The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.",
                "Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and\n      their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.",
                "The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had\n      brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard. He\n      was good. He told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. He listened to the\n      others. He started Maxwell off with a resounding, \"Let's hear about your\n      trip to the Yellowstone.\" He was laudatory, extremely laudatory. He found\n      opportunities to remark that Dr. Angus was a benefactor to humanity,\n      Maxwell and Howard Littlefield profound scholars, Charles McKelvey an\n      inspiration to ambitious youth, and Mrs. McKelvey an adornment to the\n      social circles of Zenith, Washington, New York, Paris, and numbers of\n      other places.",
                "But he could not stir them. It was a dinner without a soul. For no reason\n      that was clear to Babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke\n      laboriously and unwillingly.",
                "He concentrated on Lucille McKelvey, carefully not looking at her blanched\n      lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported her frock.",
                "\"I suppose you'll be going to Europe pretty soon again, won't you?\" he\n      invited.",
                "\"I'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.\"",
                "\"I suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything\n      there.\"",
                "\"No, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della\n      Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world.\"",
                "\"Oh, I -- Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.\"",
                "At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife\n      had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, \"We\n      must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days.\"",
                "When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his\n      wife, pleading, \"Charley said he had a corking time and we must lunch -- said\n      they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long.\"",
                "She achieved, \"Oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are\n      often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at\n      once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment.\"",
                "But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,\n      without hope.",
                "IV",
                "For a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return\n      dinner-invitation.",
                "As the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the week\n      after the Babbitts' dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald (who had\n      come to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on\n      prohibition, Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of exchange,\n      tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of American women, and\n      daily life as lived by English county families. Sir Gerald seemed to have\n      heard of all those topics. The McKelveys gave him a Singhalese dinner, and\n      Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, society editor of the Advocate-Times, rose to her\n      highest lark-note. Babbitt read aloud at breakfast-table:",
                "'Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange and delicious\n      food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests, the charming\n      hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith seen a more recherche affair\n      than the Ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Charles\n      McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak. Methought as we -- fortunate one! -- were\n      privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene, nothing at Monte Carlo or\n      the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be more lovely.\n      It is not for nothing that Zenith is in matters social rapidly becoming\n      known as the choosiest inland city in the country.",
                "Though he is too modest to admit it, Lord Doak gives a cachet to our smart\n      quartier such as it has not received since the ever-memorable visit of the\n      Earl of Sittingbourne. Not only is he of the British peerage, but he is\n      also, on dit, a leader of the British metal industries. As he comes from\n      Nottingham, a favorite haunt of Robin Hood, though now, we are informed by\n      Lord Doak, a live modern city of 275,573 inhabitants, and important lace\n      as well as other industries, we like to think that perhaps through his\n      veins runs some of the blood, both virile red and bonny blue, of that\n      earlier lord o' the good greenwood, the roguish Robin.",
                "The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than last evening in\n      her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her exquisite\n      waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.",
                "Babbitt said bravely, \"I hope they don't invite us to meet this Lord Doak\n      guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with Charley\n      and the Missus.\"",
                "At the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. \"I s'pose we'll have\n      to call McKelvey 'Lord Chaz' from now on,\" said Sidney Finkelstein.",
                "\"It beats all get-out,\" meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield,\n      \"how hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call\n      this fellow 'Lord Doak' when it ought to be 'Sir Gerald.'\"",
                "Babbitt marvelled, \"Is that a fact! Well, well! 'Sir Gerald,' eh? That's\n      what you call um, eh? Well, sir, I'm glad to know that.\"",
                "Later he informed his salesmen, \"It's funnier 'n a goat the way some folks\n      that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go entertaining famous\n      foreigners, don't have any more idea 'n a rabbit how to address 'em so's\n      to make 'em feel at home!\"",
                "That evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey's limousine and\n      saw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose\n      dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. Babbitt\n      drove on slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained, and\n      horrible conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him.",
                "He betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his\n      wife, \"Folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste on\n      a bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other hobby; if\n      you devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a chance to\n      visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing\n      round.\"",
                "They did not speak of the McKelveys again.",
                "V",
                "It was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the\n      Overbrooks.",
                "Ed Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a\n      large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of\n      Dorchester. He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been gray\n      and thin and unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you forgot\n      to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm. He had admired\n      Babbitt's good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since his power in\n      real estate, his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. It pleased\n      Babbitt, though it bothered him with a sense of responsibility. At the\n      class-dinner he had seen poor Overbrook, in a shiny blue serge\n      business-suit, being diffident in a corner with three other failures. He\n      had gone over and been cordial: \"Why, hello, young Ed! I hear you're\n      writing all the insurance in Dorchester now. Bully work!\"",
                "They recalled the good old days when Overbrook used to write poetry.\n      Overbrook embarrassed him by blurting, \"Say, Georgie, I hate to think of\n      how we been drifting apart. I wish you and Mrs. Babbitt would come to\n      dinner some night.\"",
                "Babbitt boomed, \"Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And the wife and I want to\n      have you at the house.\" He forgot it, but unfortunately Ed Overbrook did\n      not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. \"Might\n      as well go and get it over,\" Babbitt groaned to his wife. \"But don't it\n      simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about\n      social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting\n      down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it.\n      That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle.\"",
                "He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two\n      weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so\n      appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes\n      dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of\n      their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to\n      the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.",
                "It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at\n      six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted\n      himself to be ten minutes late. \"Let's make it as short as possible. I\n      think we'll duck out quick. I'll say I have to be at the office extra\n      early to-morrow,\" he planned.",
                "The Overbrook house was depressing. It was the second story of a wooden\n      two-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in the hall,\n      cabbage-smell, and a Family Bible on the parlor table. Ed Overbrook and\n      his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the other guests\n      were two dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught and never\n      desired to catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the tactless\n      way in which Overbrook praised him: \"We're mighty proud to have old George\n      here to-night! Of course you've all read about his speeches and oratory in\n      the papers -- and the boy's good-looking, too, eh? -- but what I\n      always think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer he was, and\n      one of the best swimmers in the class.\"",
                "Babbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing to\n      interest him in Overbrook's timorousness, the blankness of the other\n      guests, or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles,\n      drab skin, and tight-drawn hair. He told his best Irish story, but it sank\n      like soggy cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook,\n      peering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and\n      scrubbing, tried to be conversational.",
                "\"I suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt,\" she\n      prodded.",
                "\"Well, I get to Chicago fairly often.\"",
                "\"It must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the theaters.\"",
                "\"Well, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a\n      great big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!\"",
                "They had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope;\n      the dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of meaningless\n      talk, he said as cheerily as he could, \"'Fraid we got to be starting, Ed.\n      I've got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow.\" As Overbrook helped\n      him with his coat, Babbitt said, \"Nice to rub up on the old days! We must\n      have lunch together, P.D.Q.\"",
                "Mrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, \"It was pretty terrible. But how\n      Mr. Overbrook does admire you!\"",
                "\"Yep. Poor cuss! Seems to think I'm a little tin archangel, and the\n      best-looking man in Zenith.\"",
                "\"Well, you're certainly not that but -- Oh, Georgie, you don't suppose\n      we have to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?\"",
                "\"Ouch! Gaw, I hope not!\"",
                "\"See here, now, George! You didn't say anything about it to Mr. Overbrook,\n      did you?\"",
                "\"No! Gee! No! Honest, I didn't! Just made a bluff about having him to\n      lunch some time.\"",
                "\"Well.... Oh, dear.... I don't want to hurt their feelings. But I don't\n      see how I could stand another evening like this one. And suppose somebody\n      like Dr. and Mrs. Angus came in when we had the Overbrooks there, and\n      thought they were friends of ours!\"",
                "For a week they worried, \"We really ought to invite Ed and his wife, poor\n      devils!\" But as they never saw the Overbrooks, they forgot them, and after\n      a month or two they said, \"That really was the best way, just to let it\n      slide. It wouldn't be kind to THEM to have them here. They'd feel so out\n      of place and hard-up in our home.\"",
                "They did not speak of the Overbrooks again."

                "THE certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the McKelveys made\n      Babbitt feel guilty and a little absurd. But he went more regularly to the\n      Elks; at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon he was oratorical regarding the\n      wickedness of strikes; and again he saw himself as a Prominent Citizen.",
                "His clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit.",
                "Of a decent man in Zenith it was required that he should belong to one,\n      preferably two or three, of the innumerous \"lodges\" and\n      prosperity-boosting lunch-clubs; to the Rotarians, the Kiwanis, or the\n      Boosters; to the Oddfellows, Moose, Masons, Red Men, Woodmen, Owls,\n      Eagles, Maccabees, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Columbus, and other\n      secret orders characterized by a high degree of heartiness, sound morals,\n      and reverence for the Constitution. There were four reasons for joining\n      these orders: It was the thing to do. It was good for business, since\n      lodge-brothers frequently became customers. It gave to Americans unable to\n      become Geheimrate or Commendatori such unctuous honorifics as High Worthy\n      Recording Scribe and Grand Hoogow to add to the commonplace distinctions\n      of Colonel, Judge, and Professor. And it permitted the swaddled American\n      husband to stay away from home for one evening a week. The lodge was his\n      piazza, his pavement cafe. He could shoot pool and talk man-talk and be\n      obscene and valiant.",
                "Babbitt was what he called a \"joiner\" for all these reasons.",
                "Behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the dun\n      background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of properties\n      to rent. The evenings of oratory and committees and lodges stimulated him\n      like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. Week by week he\n      accumulated nervousness. He was in open disagreement with his outside\n      salesman, Stanley Graff; and once, though her charms had always kept him\n      nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at Miss McGoun for changing his\n      letters.",
                "But in the presence of Paul Riesling he relaxed. At least once a week they\n      fled from maturity. On Saturday they played golf, jeering, \"As a golfer,\n      you're a fine tennis-player,\" or they motored all Sunday afternoon,\n      stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a counter and\n      drink coffee from thick cups. Sometimes Paul came over in the evening with\n      his violin, and even Zilla was silent as the lonely man who had lost his\n      way and forever crept down unfamiliar roads spun out his dark soul in\n      music.",
                "II",
                "Nothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for\n      the Sunday School.",
                "His church, the Chatham Road Presbyterian, was one of the largest and\n      richest, one of the most oaken and velvety, in Zenith. The pastor was the\n      Reverend John Jennison Drew, M.A., D.D., LL.D. (The M.A. and the D.D. were\n      from Elbert University, Nebraska, the LL.D. from Waterbury College,\n      Oklahoma.) He was eloquent, efficient, and versatile. He presided at\n      meetings for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of domestic\n      service, and confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he had carried\n      newspapers. For the Saturday edition of the Evening Advocate he wrote\n      editorials on \"The Manly Man's Religion\" and \"The Dollars and Sense Value\n      of Christianity,\" which were printed in bold type surrounded by a wiggly\n      border. He often said that he was \"proud to be known as primarily a\n      business man\" and that he certainly was not going to \"permit the old Satan\n      to monopolize all the pep and punch.\" He was a thin, rustic-faced young\n      man with gold spectacles and a bang of dull brown hair, but when he hurled\n      himself into oratory he glowed with power. He admitted that he was too\n      much the scholar and poet to imitate the evangelist, Mike Monday, yet he\n      had once awakened his fold to new life, and to larger collections, by the\n      challenge, \"My brethren, the real cheap skate is the man who won't lend to\n      the Lord!\"",
                "He had made his church a true community center. It contained everything\n      but a bar. It had a nursery, a Thursday evening supper with a short bright\n      missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly motion-picture\n      show, a library of technical books for young workmen -- though,\n      unfortunately, no young workman ever entered the church except to wash the\n      windows or repair the furnace -- and a sewing-circle which made short\n      little pants for the children of the poor while Mrs. Drew read aloud from\n      earnest novels.",
                "Though Dr. Drew's theology was Presbyterian, his church-building was\n      gracefully Episcopalian. As he said, it had the \"most perdurable features\n      of those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand Old England which stand\n      as symbols of the eternity of faith, religious and civil.\" It was built of\n      cheery iron-spot brick in an improved Gothic style, and the main\n      auditorium had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish alabaster\n      bowls.",
                "On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison\n      Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk young\n      ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up\n      from the basement. There was an impressive musical program, conducted by\n      Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the\n      offertory. Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had\n      taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile while he was singing, but\n      with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew's sermon.\n      It had the intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road\n      congregation from the grubby chapels on Smith Street.",
                "\"At this abundant harvest-time of all the year,\" Dr. Drew chanted, \"when,\n      though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet\n      the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o'er all the labors and\n      desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds\n      behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those\n      passed happily on; and lo! on the dim horizon we see behind dolorous\n      clouds the mighty mass of mountains -- mountains of melody, mountains\n      of mirth, mountains of might!\"",
                "\"I certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it,\" meditated\n      Babbitt.",
                "At the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor, actively\n      shaking hands at the door, twittered, \"Oh, Brother Babbitt, can you wait a\n      jiffy? Want your advice.\"",
                "\"Sure, doctor! You bet!\"",
                "\"Drop into my office. I think you'll like the cigars there.\" Babbitt did\n      like the cigars. He also liked the office, which was distinguished from\n      other offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard to\n      \"This is the Lord's Busy Day.\" Chum Frink came in, then William W.\n      Eathorne.",
                "Mr. Eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the First State Bank of\n      Zenith. He still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had been\n      the uniform of bankers in 1870. If Babbitt was envious of the Smart Set of\n      the McKelveys, before William Washington Eathorne he was reverent. Mr.\n      Eathorne had nothing to do with the Smart Set. He was above it. He was the\n      great-grandson of one of the five men who founded Zenith, in 1792, and he\n      was of the third generation of bankers. He could examine credits, make\n      loans, promote or injure a man's business. In his presence Babbitt\n      breathed quickly and felt young.",
                "The Reverend Dr. Drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:",
                "\"I've asked you gentlemen to stay so I can put a proposition before you.\n      The Sunday School needs bucking up. It's the fourth largest in Zenith, but\n      there's no reason why we should take anybody's dust. We ought to be first.\n      I want to request you, if you will, to form a committee of advice and\n      publicity for the Sunday School; look it over and make any suggestions for\n      its betterment, and then, perhaps, see that the press gives us some\n      attention -- give the public some really helpful and constructive news\n      instead of all these murders and divorces.\"",
                "\"Excellent,\" said the banker.",
                "Babbitt and Frink were enchanted to join him.",
                "III",
                "If you had asked Babbitt what his religion was, he would have answered in\n      sonorous Boosters'-Club rhetoric, \"My religion is to serve my fellow men,\n      to honor my brother as myself, and to do my bit to make life happier for\n      one and all.\" If you had pressed him for more detail, he would have\n      announced, \"I'm a member of the Presbyterian Church, and naturally, I\n      accept its doctrines.\" If you had been so brutal as to go on, he would\n      have protested, \"There's no use discussing and arguing about religion; it\n      just stirs up bad feeling.\"",
                "Actually, the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being\n      who had tried to make us perfect, but presumably had failed; that if one\n      was a Good Man he would go to a place called Heaven (Babbitt unconsciously\n      pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a private garden), but\n      if one was a Bad Man, that is, if he murdered or committed burglary or\n      used cocaine or had mistresses or sold non-existent real estate, he would\n      be punished. Babbitt was uncertain, however, about what he called \"this\n      business of Hell.\" He explained to Ted, \"Of course I'm pretty liberal; I\n      don't exactly believe in a fire-and-brimstone Hell. Stands to reason,\n      though, that a fellow can't get away with all sorts of Vice and not get\n      nicked for it, see how I mean?\"",
                "Upon this theology he rarely pondered. The kernel of his practical\n      religion was that it was respectable, and beneficial to one's business, to\n      be seen going to services; that the church kept the Worst Elements from\n      being still worse; and that the pastor's sermons, however dull they might\n      seem at the time of taking, yet had a voodooistic power which \"did a\n      fellow good -- kept him in touch with Higher Things.\"",
                "His first investigations for the Sunday School Advisory Committee did not\n      inspire him.",
                "He liked the Busy Folks' Bible Class, composed of mature men and women and\n      addressed by the old-school physician, Dr. T. Atkins Jordan, in a\n      sparkling style comparable to that of the more refined humorous\n      after-dinner speakers, but when he went down to the junior classes he was\n      disconcerted. He heard Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the\n      Y.M.C.A. and leader of the church-choir, a pale but strenuous young man\n      with curly hair and a smile, teaching a class of sixteen-year-old boys.\n      Smeeth lovingly admonished them, \"Now, fellows, I'm going to have a Heart\n      to Heart Talk Evening at my house next Thursday. We'll get off by\n      ourselves and be frank about our Secret Worries. You can just tell old\n      Sheldy anything, like all the fellows do at the Y. I'm going to explain\n      frankly about the horrible practises a kiddy falls into unless he's guided\n      by a Big Brother, and about the perils and glory of Sex.\" Old Sheldy\n      beamed damply; the boys looked ashamed; and Babbitt didn't know which way\n      to turn his embarrassed eyes.",
                "Less annoying but also much duller were the minor classes which were being\n      instructed in philosophy and Oriental ethnology by earnest spinsters. Most\n      of them met in the highly varnished Sunday School room, but there was an\n      overflow to the basement, which was decorated with varicose water-pipes\n      and lighted by small windows high up in the oozing wall. What Babbitt saw,\n      however, was the First Congregational Church of Catawba. He was back in\n      the Sunday School of his boyhood. He smelled again that polite stuffiness\n      to be found only in church parlors; he recalled the case of drab Sunday\n      School books: \"Hetty, a Humble Heroine\" and \"Josephus, a Lad of\n      Palestine;\" he thumbed once more the high-colored text-cards which no boy\n      wanted but no boy liked to throw away, because they were somehow sacred;\n      he was tortured by the stumbling rote of thirty-five years ago, as in the\n      vast Zenith church he listened to:",
                "\"Now, Edgar, you read the next verse. What does it mean when it says it's\n      easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye? What does this teach us?\n      Clarence! Please don't wiggle so! If you had studied your lesson you\n      wouldn't be so fidgety. Now, Earl, what is the lesson Jesus was trying to\n      teach his disciples? The one thing I want you to especially remember,\n      boys, is the words, 'With God all things are possible.' Just think of that\n      always -- Clarence, PLEASE pay attention -- just say 'With God all\n      things are possible' whenever you feel discouraged, and, Alec, will you\n      read the next verse; if you'd pay attention you wouldn't lose your place!\"",
                "Drone -- drone -- drone -- gigantic bees that boomed in a cavern\n      of drowsiness --",
                "Babbitt started from his open-eyed nap, thanked the teacher for \"the\n      privilege of listening to her splendid teaching,\" and staggered on to the\n      next circle.",
                "After two weeks of this he had no suggestions whatever for the Reverend\n      Dr. Drew.",
                "Then he discovered a world of Sunday School journals, an enormous and busy\n      domain of weeklies and monthlies which were as technical, as practical and\n      forward-looking, as the real-estate columns or the shoe-trade magazines.\n      He bought half a dozen of them at a religious book-shop and till after\n      midnight he read them and admired.",
                "He found many lucrative tips on \"Focusing Appeals,\" \"Scouting for New\n      Members,\" and \"Getting Prospects to Sign up with the Sunday School.\" He\n      particularly liked the word \"prospects,\" and he was moved by the rubric:",
                "\"The moral springs of the community's life lie deep in its Sunday Schools -- its\n      schools of religious instruction and inspiration. Neglect now means loss\n      of spiritual vigor and moral power in years to come.... Facts like the\n      above, followed by a straight-arm appeal, will reach folks who can never\n      be laughed or jollied into doing their part.\"",
                "Babbitt admitted, \"That's so. I used to skin out of the ole Sunday School\n      at Catawba every chance I got, but same time, I wouldn't be where I am\n      to-day, maybe, if it hadn't been for its training in -- in moral power.\n      And all about the Bible. (Great literature. Have to read some of it again,\n      one of these days).\"",
                "How scientifically the Sunday School could be organized he learned from an\n      article in the Westminster Adult Bible Class:",
                "\"The second vice-president looks after the fellowship of the class. She\n      chooses a group to help her. These become ushers. Every one who comes gets\n      a glad hand. No one goes away a stranger. One member of the group stands\n      on the doorstep and invites passers-by to come in.\"",
                "Perhaps most of all Babbitt appreciated the remarks by William H. Ridgway\n      in the Sunday School Times:",
                "\"If you have a Sunday School class without any pep and get-up-and-go in\n      it, that is, without interest, that is uncertain in attendance, that acts\n      like a fellow with the spring fever, let old Dr. Ridgway write you a\n      prescription. Rx. Invite the Bunch for Supper.\"",
                "The Sunday School journals were as well rounded as they were practical.\n      They neglected none of the arts. As to music the Sunday School Times\n      advertised that C. Harold Lowden, \"known to thousands through his sacred\n      compositions,\" had written a new masterpiece, \"entitled 'Yearning for\n      You.' The poem, by Harry D. Kerr, is one of the daintiest you could\n      imagine and the music is indescribably beautiful. Critics are agreed that\n      it will sweep the country. May be made into a charming sacred song by\n      substituting the hymn words, 'I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say.'\"",
                "Even manual training was adequately considered. Babbitt noted an ingenious\n      way of illustrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ:",
                "\"Model for Pupils to Make. Tomb with Rolling Door. -- Use a square\n      covered box turned upside down. Pull the cover forward a little to form a\n      groove at the bottom. Cut a square door, also cut a circle of cardboard to\n      more than cover the door. Cover the circular door and the tomb thickly\n      with stiff mixture of sand, flour and water and let it dry. It was the\n      heavy circular stone over the door the women found 'rolled away' on Easter\n      morning. This is the story we are to 'Go-tell.'\"",
                "In their advertisements the Sunday School journals were thoroughly\n      efficient. Babbitt was interested in a preparation which \"takes the place\n      of exercise for sedentary men by building up depleted nerve tissue,\n      nourishing the brain and the digestive system.\" He was edified to learn\n      that the selling of Bibles was a hustling and strictly competitive\n      industry, and as an expert on hygiene he was pleased by the Sanitary\n      Communion Outfit Company's announcement of \"an improved and satisfactory\n      outfit throughout, including highly polished beautiful mahogany tray. This\n      tray eliminates all noise, is lighter and more easily handled than others\n      and is more in keeping with the furniture of the church than a tray of any\n      other material.\"",

                "THERE are but three or four old houses in Floral Heights, and in Floral\n      Heights an old house is one which was built before 1880. The largest of\n      these is the residence of William Washington Eathorne, president of the\n      First State Bank.",
                "The Eathorne Mansion preserves the memory of the \"nice parts\" of Zenith as\n      they appeared from 1860 to 1900. It is a red brick immensity with gray\n      sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and\n      dyspeptic yellow. There are two anemic towers, one roofed with copper, the\n      other crowned with castiron ferns. The porch is like an open tomb; it is\n      supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen cascades of\n      brick. At one side of the house is a huge stained-glass window in the\n      shape of a keyhole.",
                "But the house has an effect not at all humorous. It embodies the heavy\n      dignity of those Victorian financiers who ruled the generation between the\n      pioneers and the brisk \"sales-engineers\" and created a somber oligarchy by\n      gaining control of banks, mills, land, railroads, mines. Out of the dozen\n      contradictory Zeniths which together make up the true and complete Zenith,\n      none is so powerful and enduring yet none so unfamiliar to the citizens as\n      the small, still, dry, polite, cruel Zenith of the William Eathornes; and\n      for that tiny hierarchy the other Zeniths unwittingly labor and\n      insignificantly die.",
                "Most of the castles of the testy Victorian tetrarchs are gone now or\n      decayed into boarding-houses, but the Eathorne Mansion remains virtuous\n      and aloof, reminiscent of London, Back Bay, Rittenhouse Square. Its marble\n      steps are scrubbed daily, the brass plate is reverently polished, and the\n      lace curtains are as prim and superior as William Washington Eathorne\n      himself.",
                "With a certain awe Babbitt and Chum Frink called on Eathorne for a meeting\n      of the Sunday School Advisory Committee; with uneasy stillness they\n      followed a uniformed maid through catacombs of reception-rooms to the\n      library. It was as unmistakably the library of a solid old banker as\n      Eathorne's side-whiskers were the side-whiskers of a solid old banker. The\n      books were most of them Standard Sets, with the correct and traditional\n      touch of dim blue, dim gold, and glossy calf-skin. The fire was exactly\n      correct and traditional; a small, quiet, steady fire, reflected by\n      polished fire-irons. The oak desk was dark and old and altogether perfect;\n      the chairs were gently supercilious.",
                "Eathorne's inquiries as to the healths of Mrs. Babbitt, Miss Babbitt, and\n      the Other Children were softly paternal, but Babbitt had nothing with\n      which to answer him. It was indecent to think of using the \"How's tricks,\n      ole socks?\" which gratified Vergil Gunch and Frink and Howard Littlefield -- men\n      who till now had seemed successful and urbane. Babbitt and Frink sat\n      politely, and politely did Eathorne observe, opening his thin lips just\n      wide enough to dismiss the words, \"Gentlemen, before we begin our\n      conference -- you may have felt the cold in coming here -- so good\n      of you to save an old man the journey -- shall we perhaps have a whisky\n      toddy?\"",
                "So well trained was Babbitt in all the conversation that befits a Good\n      Fellow that he almost disgraced himself with \"Rather than make trouble,\n      and always providin' there ain't any enforcement officers hiding in the\n      waste-basket -- \" The words died choking in his throat. He bowed in\n      flustered obedience. So did Chum Frink.",
                "Eathorne rang for the maid.",
                "The modern and luxurious Babbitt had never seen any one ring for a servant\n      in a private house, except during meals. Himself, in hotels, had rung for\n      bell-boys, but in the house you didn't hurt Matilda's feelings; you went\n      out in the hall and shouted for her. Nor had he, since prohibition, known\n      any one to be casual about drinking. It was extraordinary merely to sip\n      his toddy and not cry, \"Oh, maaaaan, this hits me right where I live!\" And\n      always, with the ecstasy of youth meeting greatness, he marveled, \"That\n      little fuzzy-face there, why, he could make me or break me! If he told my\n      banker to call my loans -- ! Gosh! That quarter-sized squirt! And\n      looking like he hadn't got a single bit of hustle to him! I wonder -- Do\n      we Boosters throw too many fits about pep?\"",
                "From this thought he shuddered away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne's\n      ideas on the advancement of the Sunday School, which were very clear and\n      very bad.",
                "Diffidently Babbitt outlined his own suggestions:",
                "\"I think if you analyze the needs of the school, in fact, going right at\n      it as if it was a merchandizing problem, of course the one basic and\n      fundamental need is growth. I presume we're all agreed we won't be\n      satisfied till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole\n      state, so the Chatham Road Presbyterian won't have to take anything off\n      anybody. Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already\n      used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most\n      members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols\n      and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of\n      something a real live kid would want to work for, like real cash or a\n      speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy\n      to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard\n      drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting\n      out and drumming up customers -- or members, I mean, why, you got to\n      make it worth a fellow's while.",
                "\"Now, I want to propose two stunts: First, divide the Sunday School into\n      four armies, depending on age. Everybody gets a military rank in his own\n      army according to how many members he brings in, and the duffers that lie\n      down on us and don't bring in any, they remain privates. The pastor and\n      superintendent rank as generals. And everybody has got to give salutes and\n      all the rest of that junk, just like a regular army, to make 'em feel it's\n      worth while to get rank.",
                "\"Then, second: Course the school has its advertising committee, but, Lord,\n      nobody ever really works good -- nobody works well just for the love of\n      it. The thing to do is to be practical and up-to-date, and hire a real\n      paid press-agent for the Sunday School-some newspaper fellow who can give\n      part of his time.\"",
                "\"Sure, you bet!\" said Chum Frink.",
                "\"Think of the nice juicy bits he could get in!\" Babbitt crowed. \"Not only\n      the big, salient, vital facts, about how fast the Sunday School -- and\n      the collection -- is growing, but a lot of humorous gossip and kidding:\n      about how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new members, or the\n      good time the Sacred Trinity class of girls had at their wieniewurst\n      party. And on the side, if he had time, the press-agent might even boost\n      the lessons themselves -- do a little advertising for all the Sunday\n      Schools in town, in fact. No use being hoggish toward the rest of 'em,\n      providing we can keep the bulge on 'em in membership. Frinstance, he might\n      get the papers to -- Course I haven't got a literary training like\n      Frink here, and I'm just guessing how the pieces ought to be written, but\n      take frinstance, suppose the week's lesson is about Jacob; well, the\n      press-agent might get in something that would have a fine moral, and yet\n      with a trick headline that'd get folks to read it -- say like: 'Jake\n      Fools the Old Man; Makes Getaway with Girl and Bankroll.' See how I mean?\n      That'd get their interest! Now, course, Mr. Eathorne, you're conservative,\n      and maybe you feel these stunts would be undignified, but honestly, I\n      believe they'd bring home the bacon.\"",
                "Eathorne folded his hands on his comfortable little belly and purred like\n      an aged pussy:",
                "\"May I say, first, that I have been very much pleased by your analysis of\n      the situation, Mr. Babbitt. As you surmise, it's necessary in My Position\n      to be conservative, and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain standard of\n      dignity. Yet I think you'll find me somewhat progressive. In our bank, for\n      example, I hope I may say that we have as modern a method of publicity and\n      advertising as any in the city. Yes, I fancy you'll find us oldsters quite\n      cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the age. Yes, oh yes. And\n      so, in fact, it pleases me to be able to say that though personally I\n      might prefer the sterner Presbyterianism of an earlier era -- \"",

At least he was paid for giving six hours a week. He\n      had friends on the Press and the Gazette and he was not (officially) known\n      as a press-agent. He procured a trickle of insinuating items about\n      neighborliness and the Bible, about class-suppers, jolly but educational,\n      and the value of the Prayer-life in attaining financial success.",
                "The Sunday School adopted Babbitt's system of military ranks. Quickened by\n      this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. It did not become the largest\n      school in Zenith -- the Central Methodist Church kept ahead of it by\n      methods which Dr. Drew scored as \"unfair, undignified, un-American,\n      ungentlemanly, and unchristian\" -- but it climbed from fourth place to\n      second, and there was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion of\n      heaven included in the parsonage of Dr. Drew, while Babbitt had much\n      praise and good repute.",
                "He had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He\n      was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his\n      ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called \"Colonel;\"\n       and if he did not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted,\n      certainly he thought about it all the way there.",
                "He was particularly pleasant to the press-agent, Kenneth Escott; he took\n      him to lunch at the Athletic Club and had him at the house for dinner.",
                "Like many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent\n      contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, Escott\n      was shy and lonely. His shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at\n      dinner, and he blurted, \"Gee whillikins, Mrs. Babbitt, if you knew how\n      good it is to have home eats again!\"",
                "Escott and Verona liked each other. All evening they \"talked about ideas.\"\n       They discovered that they were Radicals. True, they were sensible about\n      it. They agreed that all communists were criminals; that this vers libre\n      was tommy-rot; and that while there ought to be universal disarmament, of\n      course Great Britain and the United States must, on behalf of oppressed\n      small nations, keep a navy equal to the tonnage of all the rest of the\n      world. But they were so revolutionary that they predicted (to Babbitt's\n      irritation) that there would some day be a Third Party which would give\n      trouble to the Republicans and Democrats.",

There's hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the\n      paper to say if we'll chase a reporter up to his Study, he'll let us in on\n      the story about the swell sermon he's going to preach on the wickedness of\n      short skirts, or the authorship of the Pentateuch. Don't you worry about\n      him. There's just one better publicity-grabber in town, and that's this\n      Dora Gibson Tucker that runs the Child Welfare and the Americanization\n      League, and the only reason she's got Drew beaten is because she has got\n      SOME brains!\"",

                "Thus it came to pass that in the Sunday Advocate-Times, under a picture of\n      Dr. Drew at his earnestest, with eyes alert, jaw as granite, and rustic\n      lock flamboyant, appeared an inscription -- a wood-pulp tablet\n      conferring twenty-four hours' immortality:",

Babbitt said boyishly to Drew:",

They were, he said, the\n      pastors of the fold of commerce. For the first time Eathorne departed from\n      the topic of Sunday Schools, and asked Babbitt about the progress of his\n      business. Babbitt answered modestly, almost filially.",
                "A few months later, when he had a chance to take part in the Street\n      Traction Company's terminal deal, Babbitt did not care to go to his own\n      bank for a loan. It was rather a quiet sort of deal and, if it had come\n      out, the Public might not have understood. He went to his friend Mr.\n      Eathorne; he was welcomed, and received the loan as a private venture; and\n      they both profited in their pleasant new association.",
                "After that, Babbitt went to church regularly, except on spring Sunday\n      mornings which were obviously meant for motoring. He announced to Ted, \"I\n      tell you, boy, there's no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than the\n      evangelical church, and no better place to make friends who'll help you to\n      gain your rightful place in the community than in your own church-home!\""

I won't have all this sentimental nonsense, that\n      would spoil everything.\"",

                "With conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in\n      manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was\n      struggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School. At home\n      he was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the\n      ignition system of the car. He repeated to his tut-tutting father that he\n      did not wish to go to college or law-school, and Babbitt was equally\n      disturbed by this \"shiftlessness\" and by Ted's relations with Eunice\n      Littlefield, next door.",
                "Though she was the daughter of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron\n      fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a\n      midge in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into\n      Babbitt's lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed at\n      him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he\n      hated a broken sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition was to\n      be a cinema actress. She did not merely attend the showing of every\n      \"feature film;\" she also read the motion-picture magazines, those\n      extraordinary symptoms of the Age of Pep -- monthlies and weeklies gorgeously\n      illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently been manicure\n      girls, not very skilful manicure girls, and who, unless their every\n      grimace had been arranged by a director, could not have acted in the\n      Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church; magazines reporting, quite\n      seriously, in \"interviews\" plastered with pictures of riding-breeches and\n      California bungalows, the views on sculpture and international politics of\n      blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful young men; outlining the plots\n      of films about pure prostitutes and kind-hearted train-robbers; and giving\n      directions for making bootblacks into Celebrated Scenario Authors\n      overnight.",
                "These authorities Eunice studied. She could, she frequently did, tell\n      whether it was in November or December, 1905, that Mack Harker? the\n      renowned screen cowpuncher and badman, began his public career as chorus\n      man in \"Oh, You Naughty Girlie.\" On the wall of her room, her father\n      reported, she had pinned up twenty-one photographs of actors.

He smelled the cloying reek from up-stairs, and\n      heard her giggling with Ted. He never inquired. The agreeable child\n      dismayed him. Her thin and charming face was sharpened by bobbed hair; her\n      skirts were short, her stockings were rolled, and, as she flew after Ted,\n      above the caressing silk were glimpses of soft knees which made Babbitt\n      uneasy, and wretched that she should consider him old. Sometimes, in the\n      veiled life of his dreams, when the fairy child came running to him she\n      took on the semblance of Eunice Littlefield.",

However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil,\n      he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic\n      Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went\n      skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit.\n      Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven\n      sandwiches and a bottle of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched\n      eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant towns.",
                "Usually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with a\n      wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the color\n      and scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little furtive, and\n      Babbitt was worried.",
                "Babbitt was an average father. He was affectionate, bullying, opinionated,\n      ignorant, and rather wistful. Like most parents, he enjoyed the game of\n      waiting till the victim was clearly wrong, then virtuously pouncing. He\n      justified himself by croaking, \"Well, Ted's mother spoils him. Got to be\n      somebody who tells him what's what, and me, I'm elected the goat. Because\n      I try to bring him up to be a real, decent, human being and not one of\n      these sapheads and lounge-lizards, of course they all call me a grouch!\"",
                "Throughout, with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst\n      possible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals, Babbitt loved his son and\n      warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for him -- if\n      he could have been sure of proper credit.",

From his memory of\n      high-school pleasures back in Catawba he suggested the nicest games: Going\n      to Boston, and charades with stew-pans for helmets, and word-games in\n      which you were an Adjective or a Quality. When he was most enthusiastic he\n      discovered that they weren't paying attention; they were only tolerating\n      him. As for the party, it was as fixed and standardized as a Union Club\n      Hop. There was to be dancing in the living-room, a noble collation in the\n      dining-room, and in the hall two tables of bridge for what Ted called \"the\n      poor old dumb-bells that you can't get to dance hardly more 'n half the\n      time.\"",
                "Every breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair. No one\n      listened to Babbitt's bulletins about the February weather or to his\n      throat-clearing comments on the headlines. He said furiously, \"If I may be\n      PERMITTED to interrupt your engrossing private CONVERSATION -- Juh hear\n      what I SAID?\"",
                "\"Oh, don't be a spoiled baby! Ted and I have just as much right to talk as\n      you have!\" flared Mrs. Babbitt.",
                "On the night of the party he was permitted to look on, when he was not\n      helping Matilda with the Vecchia ice cream and the petits fours. He was\n      deeply disquieted. Eight years ago, when Verona had given a high-school\n      party, the children had been featureless gabies. Now they were men and\n      women of the world, very supercilious men and women; the boys condescended\n      to Babbitt, they wore evening-clothes, and with hauteur they accepted\n      cigarettes from silver cases. Babbitt had heard stories of what the\n      Athletic Club called \"goings on\" at young parties; of girls \"parking\"\n       their corsets in the dressing-room, of \"cuddling\" and \"petting,\" and a\n      presumable increase in what was known as Immorality. To-night he believed\n      the stories. These children seemed bold to him, and cold. The girls wore\n      misty chiffon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and around their dipping\n      bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He had it, upon urgent and secret\n      inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked upstairs; but certainly\n      these eager bodies were not stiff with steel. Their stockings were of\n      lustrous silk, their slippers costly and unnatural, their lips carmined\n      and their eyebrows penciled. They danced cheek to cheek with the boys, and\n      Babbitt sickened with apprehension and unconscious envy.",
                "Worst of them all was Eunice Littlefield, and maddest of all the boys was\n      Ted. Eunice was a flying demon. She slid the length of the room; her\n      tender shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver's shuttle; she\n      laughed, and enticed Babbitt to dance with her.",
                "Then he discovered the annex to the party.",
                "The boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors of\n      their drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. He tiptoed round the\n      house, and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the\n      points of light from cigarettes, from each of them heard high giggles. He\n      wanted to denounce them but (standing in the snow, peering round the dark\n      corner) he did not dare. He tried to be tactful. When he had returned to\n      the front hall he coaxed the boys, \"Say, if any of you fellows are\n      thirsty, there's some dandy ginger ale.\"",
                "\"Oh! Thanks!\" they condescended.",
                "He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, \"I'd like to go in there\n      and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me\n      like I was the butler! I'd like to -- \"",
                "\"I know,\" she sighed; \"only everybody says, all the mothers tell me,\n      unless you stand for them, if you get angry because they go out to their\n      cars to have a drink, they won't come to your house any more, and we\n      wouldn't want Ted left out of things, would we?\"",
                "He announced that he would be enchanted to have Ted left out of things,\n      and hurried in to be polite, lest Ted be left out of things.",
                "But, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he would -- well,\n      he'd \"hand 'em something that would surprise 'em.\" While he was trying to\n      be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was earnestly sniffing\n      at them. Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it\n      was only twice --",
                "Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.",
                "He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and\n      Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He\n      called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained\n      to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went\n      off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \"That little devil!\n      Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag,\n      acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!\"",
                "Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath.",
                "After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough\n      Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences.\n      Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and\n      Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.",
                "For several months there was coolness between the Babbitts and the\n      Littlefields, each family sheltering their lamb from the wolf-cub next\n      door. Babbitt and Littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about\n      motors and the senate, but they kept bleakly away from mention of their\n      families. Whenever Eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant\n      intimacy the fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house; and\n      Babbitt tried, with no success whatever, to be fatherly and advisory with\n      her.",
                "III",

Every evening he sits there, about half-asleep, and if Rone\n      or I say, 'Oh, come on, let's do something,' he doesn't even take the\n      trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says, 'Naw, this suits me\n      right here.' He doesn't know there's any fun going on anywhere. I suppose\n      he must do some thinking, same as you and I do, but gosh, there's no way\n      of telling it. I don't believe that outside of the office and playing a\n      little bum golf on Saturday he knows there's anything in the world to do\n      except just keep sitting there -- sitting there every night -- not wanting\n      to go anywhere -- not wanting to do anything -- thinking us kids are\n      crazy -- sitting there -- Lord!\"",

                "If he was frightened by Ted's slackness, Babbitt was not sufficiently\n      frightened by Verona. She was too safe. She lived too much in the neat\n      little airless room of her mind. Kenneth Escott and she were always under\n      foot. When they were not at home, conducting their cautiously radical\n      courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to lectures by\n      authors and Hindu philosophers and Swedish lieutenants.",
                "\"Gosh,\" Babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the Fogartys'\n      bridge-party, \"it gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so poky. They\n      sit there night after night, whenever he isn't working, and they don't\n      know there's any fun in the world. All talk and discussion -- Lord!\n      Sitting there -- sitting there -- night after night -- not\n      wanting to do anything -- thinking I'm crazy because I like to go out\n      and play a fist of cards -- sitting there -- gosh!\"",

They were lonely there,\n      and every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on\n      fricasseed chicken, discouraged celery, and cornstarch ice cream, and\n      afterward sit, polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young\n      woman violinist played songs from the German via Broadway.",
                "Then Babbitt's own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.",
                "She was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending. She congratulated\n      the convention-defying Verona on being a \"nice, loyal home-body without\n      all these Ideas that so many girls seem to have nowadays;\" and when Ted\n      filled the differential with grease, out of pure love of mechanics and\n      filthiness, she rejoiced that he was \"so handy around the house -- and\n      helping his father and all, and not going out with the girls all the time\n      and trying to pretend he was a society fellow.\"",
                "Babbitt loved his mother, and sometimes he rather liked her, but he was\n      annoyed by her Christian Patience, and he was reduced to pulpiness when\n      she discoursed about a quite mythical hero called \"Your Father\":",
                "\"You won't remember it, Georgie, you were such a little fellow at the time -- my,\n      I remember just how you looked that day, with your goldy brown curls and\n      your lace collar, you always were such a dainty child, and kind of puny\n      and sickly, and you loved pretty things so much and the red tassels on\n      your little bootees and all -- and Your Father was taking us to church\n      and a man stopped us and said 'Major' -- so many of the neighbors used\n      to call Your Father 'Major;' of course he was only a private in The War\n      but everybody knew that was because of the jealousy of his captain and he\n      ought to have been a high-ranking officer, he had that natural ability to\n      command that so very, very few men have -- and this man came out into\n      the road and held up his hand and stopped the buggy and said, 'Major,' he\n      said, 'there's a lot of the folks around here that have decided to support\n      Colonel Scanell for congress, and we want you to join us. Meeting people\n      the way you do in the store, you could help us a lot.'",
                "\"Well, Your Father just looked at him and said, 'I certainly shall do\n      nothing of the sort. I don't like his politics,' he said. Well, the man -- Captain\n      Smith they used to call him, and heaven only knows why, because he hadn't\n      the shadow or vestige of a right to be called 'Captain' or any other title -- this\n      Captain Smith said, 'We'll make it hot for you if you don't stick by your\n      friends, Major.' Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew\n      it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the\n      political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was\n      one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and\n      trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he\n      said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply\n      qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!' and\n      with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like\n      a bump on a log!\"",
                "Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the\n      children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the\n      \"loveliest little pink bow in his curls\" and corrupted his own name to\n      \"Goo-goo.\" He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing\n      Tinka, \"Come on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat\n      it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.\"",
                "Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down\n      from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty\n      general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of\n      the good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and\n      disagreeable. His favorite remark was \"How much did you pay for that?\" He\n      regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table\n      as citified extravagances, and said so. Babbitt would have quarreled with\n      him but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom Babbitt teased and poked\n      fingers at and addressed:",
                "\"I think this baby's a bum, yes, sir, I think this little baby's a bum,\n      he's a bum, yes, sir, he's a bum, that's what he is, he's a bum, this\n      baby's a bum, he's nothing but an old bum, that's what he is -- a bum!\"",
                "All the while Verona and Kenneth Escott held long inquiries into\n      epistemology; Ted was a disgraced rebel; and Tinka, aged eleven, was\n      demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, \"like all\n      the girls.\"",
                "Babbitt raged, \"I'm sick of it! Having to carry three generations. Whole\n      damn bunch lean on me. Pay half of mother's income, listen to Henry T.,\n      listen to Myra's worrying, be polite to Mart, and get called an old grouch\n      for trying to help the children. All of 'em depending on me and picking on\n      me and not a damn one of 'em grateful! No relief, and no credit, and no\n      help from anybody. And to keep it up for -- good Lord, how long?\"",
                "He enjoyed being sick in February; he was delighted by their consternation\n      that he, the rock, should give way.",
                "He had eaten a questionable clam. For two days he was languorous and\n      petted and esteemed. He was allowed to snarl \"Oh, let me alone!\" without\n      reprisals. He lay on the sleeping-porch and watched the winter sun slide\n      along the taut curtains, turning their ruddy khaki to pale blood red. The\n      shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing ripple on the\n      canvas. He found pleasure in the curve of it, sighed as the fading light\n      blurred it. He was conscious of life, and a little sad. With no Vergil\n      Gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism, he beheld, and\n      half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as incredibly mechanical.\n      Mechanical business -- a brisk selling of badly built houses.\n      Mechanical religion -- a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life\n      of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. Mechanical golf and\n      dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul Riesling,\n      mechanical friendships -- back-slapping and jocular, never daring to\n      essay the test of quietness.",
                "He turned uneasily in bed.",
                "He saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet\n      afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle\n      pretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men\n      he hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms -- hat\n      on knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.",
                "\"I don't hardly want to go back to work,\" he prayed. \"I'd like to -- I\n      don't know.\"",
                "But he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper."

                "THE Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build car-repair shops in\n      the suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the land they found it\n      held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. The\n      purchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of the\n      Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned their\n      duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts, though\n      somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials\n      found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of the\n      correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed by any\n      public commission.",
                "Just after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank, the\n      purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five thousand\n      dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon Woods, and the\n      president was appointed minister to a foreign country.",
                "To obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his\n      neighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary to\n      introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that he\n      wasn't taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a\n      poker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened his\n      whole plan. To all this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his secret\n      associates in the deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson to have any\n      share in the deal except as brokers. Babbitt rather agreed. \"Ethics of the\n      business-broker ought to strictly represent his principles and not get in\n      on the buying,\" he said to Thompson.",
                "\"Ethics, rats! Think I'm going to see that bunch of holy grafters get away\n      with the swag and us not climb in?\" snorted old Henry.",
                "\"Well, I don't like to do it. Kind of double-crossing.\"",
                "\"It ain't. It's triple-crossing. It's the public that gets double-crossed.\n      Well, now we've been ethical and got it out of our systems, the question\n      is where we can raise a loan to handle some of the property for ourselves,\n      on the Q. T. We can't go to our bank for it. Might come out.\"",
                "\"I could see old Eathorne. He's close as the tomb.\"",
                "\"That's the stuff.\"",
                "Eathorne was glad, he said, to \"invest in character,\" to make Babbitt the\n      loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the bank.\n      Thus certain of the options which Babbitt and Thompson obtained were on\n      parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the property\n      did not appear in their names.",
                "In the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business and\n      public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate activity,\n      Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person working for\n      him.",
                "The dishonest one was Stanley Graff, the outside salesman.",
                "For some time Babbitt had been worried about Graff. He did not keep his\n      word to tenants. In order to rent a house he would promise repairs which\n      the owner had not authorized. It was suspected that he juggled inventories\n      of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had to pay for\n      articles which had never been in the house and the price of which Graff\n      put into his pocket. Babbitt had not been able to prove these suspicions,\n      and though he had rather planned to discharge Graff he had never quite\n      found time for it.",
                "Now into Babbitt's private room charged a red-faced man, panting, \"Look\n      here! I've come to raise particular merry hell, and unless you have that\n      fellow pinched, I will!\" \"What's -- Calm down, o' man. What's trouble?\"",
                "\"Trouble! Huh! Here's the trouble -- \"",

I was in\n      yesterday and signs the lease, all O.K., and he was to get the owner's\n      signature and mail me the lease last night. Well, and he did. This morning\n      I comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had come to the house\n      right after the early delivery and told her he wanted an envelope that had\n      been mailed by mistake, big long envelope with 'Babbitt-Thompson' in the\n      corner of it. Sure enough, there it was, so she lets him have it. And she\n      describes the fellow to me, and it was this Graff. So I 'phones to him and\n      he, the poor fool, he admits it! He says after my lease was all signed he\n      got a better offer from another fellow and he wanted my lease back. Now\n      what you going to do about it?\"",

                "\"William Varney -- W. K. Varney.\"",
                "\"Oh, yes. That was the Garrison house.\" Babbitt sounded the buzzer. When\n      Miss McGoun came in, he demanded, \"Graff gone out?\"",
                "\"Yes, sir.\"",
                "\"Will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to\n      Mr. Varney on the Garrison house?\" To Varney: \"Can't tell you how sorry I\n      am this happened. Needless to say, I'll fire Graff the minute he comes in.\n      And of course your lease stands. But there's one other thing I'd like to\n      do. I'll tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply it to your\n      rent. No! Straight! I want to. To be frank, this thing shakes me up bad. I\n      suppose I've always been a Practical Business Man. Probably I've told one\n      or two fairy stories in my time, when the occasion called for it -- you\n      know: sometimes you have to lay things on thick, to impress boneheads. But\n      this is the first time I've ever had to accuse one of my own employees of\n      anything more dishonest than pinching a few stamps. Honest, it would hurt\n      me if we profited by it.

Worse, he had to discharge Graff and this was\n      a part of office routine which he feared.

                "As the conductor went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling\n      against his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges. They\n      arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning, rejoicing,\n      \"Pretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast, heh?\" They\n      were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith business men always\n      stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal\n      Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt ordered Blue Point oysters\n      with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of\n      French fried potatoes, two pots of coffee, apple pie with ice cream for\n      both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of mince pie.",
                "\"Hot stuff! Some feed, young fella!\" Ted admired.",

                "They went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial\n      jokes and the prohibition jokes; they paraded the lobby, arm in arm,\n      between acts, and in the glee of his first release from the shame which\n      dissevers fathers and sons Ted chuckled, \"Dad, did you ever hear the one\n      about the three milliners and the judge?\"",
                "When Ted had returned to Zenith, Babbitt was lonely. As he was trying to\n      make alliance between Offutt and certain Milwaukee interests which wanted\n      the race-track plot, most of his time was taken up in waiting for\n      telephone calls.... Sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the portable\n      telephone, asking wearily, \"Mr. Sagen not in yet? Didn' he leave any\n      message for me? All right, I'll hold the wire.\" Staring at a stain on the\n      wall, reflecting that it resembled a shoe, and being bored by this\n      twentieth discovery that it resembled a shoe. Lighting a cigarette; then,\n      bound to the telephone with no ashtray in reach, wondering what to do with\n      this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the tiled\n      bathroom. At last, on the telephone, \"No message, eh? All right, I'll call\n      up again.\"",
                "One afternoon he wandered through snow-rutted streets of which he had\n      never heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and marooned\n      cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there was nothing\n      he wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when he dined by\n      himself at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward, in a plush\n      chair bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar and looking for\n      some one who would come and play with him and save him from thinking. In\n      the chair next to him (showing the arms of Lithuania) was a half-familiar\n      man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a deficient yellow mustache.\n      He seemed kind and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He\n      wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie.",
                "It came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was\n      Sir Gerald Doak.",

                "Embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt maundered,\n      \"Well, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in Zenith.\"",
                "\"Quite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,\" he said\n      doubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly.",
                "\"How did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose\n      maybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?\"",
                "\"Scenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions -- You know, Mr.\n      Babbitt, they're having almost as much unemployment as we are.\" Sir Gerald\n      was speaking warmly now.",
                "\"So? Business conditions not so doggone good, eh?\"",
                "\"No, business conditions weren't at all what I'd hoped to find them.\"",
                "\"Not good, eh?\"",
                "\"No, not -- not really good.\"",
                "\"That's a darn shame. Well -- I suppose you're waiting for somebody to\n      take you out to some big shindig, Sir Gerald.\"",
                "\"Shindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to tell you the truth, I was wondering what the\n      deuce I could do this evening. Don't know a soul in Tchicahgo. I wonder if\n      you happen to know whether there's a good theater in this city?\"",
                "\"Good? Why say, they're running grand opera right now! I guess maybe you'd\n      like that.\"",

                "Babbitt was sitting down, hitching his chair over, shouting, \"Movie? Say,\n      Sir Gerald, I supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to lead\n      you out to some soiree -- \"",
                "\"God forbid!\"",
                "\" -- but if you haven't, what do you say you and me go to a movie?\n      There's a peach of a film at the Grantham: Bill Hart in a bandit picture.\"",
                "\"Right-o! Just a moment while I get my coat.\"",
                "Swollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of Nottingham\n      change its mind and leave him at any street corner, Babbitt paraded with\n      Sir Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat beside him,\n      trying not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise his adoration\n      of six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald murmured, \"Jolly good\n      picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take me. Haven't enjoyed myself\n      so much for weeks. All these Hostesses -- they never let you go to the\n      cinema!\"",
                "\"The devil you say!\" Babbitt's speech had lost the delicate refinement and\n      all the broad A's with which he had adorned it, and become hearty and\n      natural. \"Well, I'm tickled to death you liked it, Sir Gerald.\"",
                "They crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle; they stood in the\n      lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats. Babbitt\n      hinted, \"Say, how about a little something to eat? I know a place where we\n      could get a swell rarebit, and we might dig up a little drink -- that\n      is, if you ever touch the stuff.\"",

                "It was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, \"How do you\n      Yankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this\n      Wells represent us?

                "After the sixth, Babbitt irregularly arose. \"Well, I better be hiking\n      along. Jerry, you're a regular human being! I wish to thunder we'd been\n      better acquainted in Zenith. Lookit. Can't you come back and stay with me\n      a while?\"",

He enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room: the\n      chandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of French kings\n      against panels of gilded oak. He enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good\n      solid fellows who were \"liberal spenders.\"",

Three tables off,\n      with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered, was Paul\n      Riesling, and Paul was supposed to be in Akron, selling tar-roofing. The\n      woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and giggling. Babbitt felt that\n      he had encountered something involved and harmful. Paul was talking with\n      the rapt eagerness of a man who is telling his troubles. He was\n      concentrated on the woman's faded eyes. Once he held her hand and once,\n      blind to the other guests, he puckered his lips as though he was\n      pretending to kiss her. Babbitt had so strong an impulse to go to Paul\n      that he could feel his body uncoiling, his shoulders moving, but he felt,\n      desperately, that he must be diplomatic, and not till he saw Paul paying\n      the check did he bluster to the piano-salesman, \"By golly -- friend of mine\n      over there -- 'scuse me second -- just say hello to him.\"",

As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a\n      wall-board a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name, and\n      his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster\n      by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked\n      his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \"Hello, Chet!\" and \"How're you,\n      Shorty!\" and \"Top o' the mornin', Mac!\"",

One of the\n      merits of the Boosters' Club was that only two persons from each\n      department of business were permitted to join, so that you at once\n      encountered the Ideals of other occupations, and realized the metaphysical\n      oneness of all occupations -- plumbing and portrait-painting, medicine\n      and the manufacture of chewing-gum.",

Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor's\n      doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, \"You remember\n      me, Mr. Prout? Babbitt -- vice-president of the Boosters -- campaigned\n      for you? Say, have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on\n      the warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back and\n      see him. Good. Thanks.\"",
                "In fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage\n      where Paul Riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs\n      crossed, arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist.",
                "Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt,\n      and left them together. He spoke slowly: \"Go on! Be moral!\"",
                "Babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. \"I'm not going to be moral! I\n      don't care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I'm glad Zilla\n      got what was coming to her.\"",
                "Paul said argumentatively, \"Now, don't go jumping on Zilla. I've been\n      thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her -- I\n      didn't hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went crazy, just\n      for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot\n      rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn't hardly mean to -- After\n      that, when I was trying to stop the blood -- It was terrible what it\n      did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin -- Maybe she won't die.\n      I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward, when I was\n      hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto\n      a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I\n      remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then -- Hell. I can't hardly\n      believe it's me here.\" As Babbitt's arm tightened about his shoulder, Paul\n      sighed, \"I'm glad you came. But I thought maybe you'd lecture me, and when\n      you've committed a murder, and been brought here and everything -- there\n      was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all staring, and the cops\n      took me through it -- Oh, I'm not going to talk about it any more.\"",
                "But he went on, in a monotonous, terrified insane mumble. To divert him\n      Babbitt said, \"Why, you got a scar on your cheek.\"",
                "\"Yes. That's where the cop hit me. I suppose cops get a lot of fun out of\n      lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. And they wouldn't let me\n      help carry Zilla down to the ambulance.\"",
                "\"Paul! Quit it! Listen: she won't die, and when it's all over you and I'll\n      go off to Maine again. And maybe we can get that May Arnold to go along.\n      I'll go up to Chicago and ask her. Good woman, by golly. And afterwards\n      I'll see that you get started in business out West somewhere, maybe\n      Seattle -- they say that's a lovely city.\"",
                "Paul was half smiling. It was Babbitt who rambled now. He could not tell\n      whether Paul was heeding, but he droned on till the coming of Paul's\n      lawyer, P. J. Maxwell, a thin, busy, unfriendly man who nodded at Babbitt\n      and hinted, \"If Riesling and I could be alone for a moment -- \"",
                "Babbitt wrung Paul's hands, and waited in the office till Maxwell came\n      pattering out. \"Look, old man, what can I do?\" he begged.",
                "\"Nothing. Not a thing. Not just now,\" said Maxwell. \"Sorry. Got to hurry.\n      And don't try to see him. I've had the doctor give him a shot of morphine,\n      so he'll sleep.\"",
                "It seemed somehow wicked to return to the office. Babbitt felt as though\n      he had just come from a funeral. He drifted out to the City Hospital to\n      inquire about Zilla. She was not likely to die, he learned. The bullet\n      from Paul's huge old .44 army revolver had smashed her shoulder and torn\n      upward and out.",
                "He wandered home and found his wife radiant with the horified interest we\n      have in the tragedies of our friends. \"Of course Paul isn't altogether to\n      blame, but this is what comes of his chasing after other women instead of\n      bearing his cross in a Christian way,\" she exulted.",
                "He was too languid to respond as he desired. He said what was to be said\n      about the Christian bearing of crosses, and went out to clean the car.\n      Dully, patiently, he scraped linty grease from the drip-pan, gouged at the\n      mud caked on the wheels. He used up many minutes in washing his hands;\n      scoured them with gritty kitchen soap; rejoiced in hurting his plump\n      knuckles. \"Damn soft hands -- like a woman's. Aah!\"",
                "At dinner, when his wife began the inevitable, he bellowed, \"I forbid any\n      of you to say a word about Paul! I'll 'tend to all the talking about this\n      that's necessary, hear me? There's going to be one house in this\n      scandal-mongering town to-night that isn't going to spring the\n      holier-than-thou. And throw those filthy evening papers out of the house!\"",
                "But he himself read the papers, after dinner.",
                "Before nine he set out for the house of Lawyer Maxwell. He was received\n      without cordiality. \"Well?\" said Maxwell.",
                "\"I want to offer my services in the trial. I've got an idea. Why couldn't\n      I go on the stand and swear I was there, and she pulled the gun first and\n      he wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally?\"",
                "\"And perjure yourself?\"",
                "\"Huh? Yes, I suppose it would be perjury. Oh -- Would it help?\"",
                "\"But, my dear fellow! Perjury!\"",
                "\"Oh, don't be a fool! Excuse me, Maxwell; I didn't mean to get your goat.\n      I just mean: I've known and you've known many and many a case of perjury,\n      just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate, and here where it's\n      a case of saving Paul from going to prison, I'd perjure myself black in\n      the face.\"",
                "\"No. Aside from the ethics of the matter, I'm afraid it isn't practicable.\n      The prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces. It's known that only\n      Riesling and his wife were there at the time.\"",
                "\"Then, look here! Let me go on the stand and swear -- and this would be\n      the God's truth -- that she pestered him till he kind of went crazy.\"",
                "\"No. Sorry. Riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting\n      on his wife. He insists on pleading guilty.\"",
                "\"Then let me get up and testify something -- whatever you say. Let me\n      do SOMETHING!\"",
                "\"I'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do -- I hate to say it,\n      but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.\"",
                "Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so\n      visibly that Maxwell condescended:",
                "\"I don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our\n      best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor. The trouble\n      with you, Babbitt, is that you're one of these fellows who talk too\n      readily. You like to hear your own voice. If there were anything for which\n      I could put you in the witness-box, you'd get going and give the whole\n      show away. Sorry. Now I must look over some papers -- So sorry.\"",

But at the Roughnecks' Table they did not mention\n      Paul. They spoke with zeal of the coming baseball season. He loved them as\n      he never had before.",

Actually, the trial occupied less than fifteen minutes,\n      largely filled with the evidence of doctors that Zilla would recover and\n      that Paul must have been temporarily insane. Next day Paul was sentenced\n      to three years in the State Penitentiary and taken off -- quite\n      undramatically, not handcuffed, merely plodding in a tired way beside a\n      cheerful deputy sheriff -- and after saying good-by to him at the\n      station Babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world\n      which, without Paul, was meaningless."

Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,\n      and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,\n      what he had said to the Old Grouch, what he had said to the foreman about\n      the future of wireless telephony.",

He vaguely wanted something more diverting than the newspaper\n      comic strips to read. He ambled up to Verona's room, sat on her maidenly\n      blue and white bed, humming and grunting in a solid-citizen manner as he\n      examined her books: Conrad's \"Rescue,\" a volume strangely named \"Figures\n      of Earth,\" poetry (quite irregular poetry, Babbitt thought) by Vachel\n      Lindsay, and essays by H. L. Mencken -- highly improper essays, making\n      fun of the church and all the decencies. He liked none of the books. In\n      them he felt a spirit of rebellion against niceness and solid-citizenship.\n      These authors -- and he supposed they were famous ones, too -- did\n      not seem to care about telling a good story which would enable a fellow to\n      forget his troubles.

It would\n      be an adventure story, maybe about counterfeiting -- detectives\n      sneaking up on the old house at night.

A\n      pattern of wild geese, flying low and unconcerned above the hills, wavered\n      against the serene ashen evening.

He heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the refrigerator,\n      a rhythm demanding and disquieting. He roamed to the window. The summer\n      evening was foggy and, seen through the wire screen, the street lamps were\n      crosses of pale fire. The whole world was abnormal. While he brooded,\n      Verona and Ted came in and went up to bed. Silence thickened in the\n      sleeping house.

Babbitt had discreetly preempted\n      a place beside Louetta on the piano bench. While he talked about motors,\n      while he listened with a fixed smile to her account of the film she had\n      seen last Wednesday, while he hoped that she would hurry up and finish her\n      description of the plot, the beauty of the leading man, and the luxury of\n      the setting, he studied her. Slim waist girdled with raw silk, strong\n      brows, ardent eyes, hair parted above a broad forehead -- she meant\n      youth to him and a charm which saddened. He thought of how valiant a\n      companion she would be on a long motor tour, exploring mountains,\n      picnicking in a pine grove high above a valley. Her frailness touched him;\n      he was angry at Eddie Swanson for the incessant family bickering. All at\n      once he identified Louetta with the fairy girl. He was startled by the\n      conviction that they had always had a romantic attraction for each other.",

                "\"You bet! I'm a bad little fellow and proud of it. Some evening you slip\n      Eddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and I'll show you\n      how to mix a cocktail,\" he roared.",
                "\"Well, now, I might do it! You never can tell!\"",
                "\"Well, whenever you're ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic\n      window and I'll jump for the gin!\"",
                "Every one giggled at this naughtiness. In a pleased way Eddie Swanson\n      stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. The others\n      were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent murders, but\n      Babbitt drew Louetta back to personal things:",

                "Her eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. He was\n      convinced that he had won her. He clasped her, conscious of her smooth\n      warmth, and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the one-step. He\n      bumped into only one or two people. \"Gosh, I'm not doing so bad; hittin'\n      'em up like a regular stage dancer!\" he gloated; and she answered busily,\n      \"Yes -- yes -- I told you I could teach anybody -- DON'T TAKE\n      SUCH LONG STEPS!\"",

You're getting\n      foolish!\" he cautioned himself, the while he hopped and bent his solid\n      knees in dalliance with Mrs. Jones, and to that worthy lady rumbled, \"Gee,\n      it's hot!\" Without reason, he thought of Paul in that shadowy place where\n      men never dance. \"I'm crazy to-night; better go home,\" he worried, but he\n      left Mrs. Jones and dashed to Louetta's lovely side, demanding, \"The next\n      is mine.\"",

She had\n      come to inquire about renting an apartment, and he took her away from the\n      unskilled girl accountant. He was nervously attracted by her smartness.\n      She was a slender woman, in a black Swiss frock dotted with white, a\n      cool-looking graceful frock. A broad black hat shaded her face.

The girl who especially disturbed him -- though he had\n      never spoken to her -- was the last manicure girl on the right in the\n      Pompeian Barber Shop. She was small, swift, black-haired, smiling. She was\n      nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored blouses which\n      exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned camisoles.",
                "He went to the Pompeian for his fortnightly hair-trim. As always, he felt\n      disloyal at deserting his neighbor, the Reeves Building Barber Shop. Then,\n      for the first time, he overthrew his sense of guilt. \"Doggone it, I don't\n      have to go here if I don't want to! I don't own the Reeves Building! These\n      barbers got nothing on me! I'll doggone well get my hair cut where I\n      doggone well want to! Don't want to hear anything more about it! I'm\n      through standing by people -- unless I want to. It doesn't get you\n      anywhere. I'm through!\"",
                "The Pompeian Barber Shop was in the basement of the Hotel Thornleigh,\n      largest and most dynamically modern hotel in Zenith. Curving marble steps\n      with a rail of polished brass led from the hotel-lobby down to the barber\n      shop. The interior was of black and white and crimson tiles, with a\n      sensational ceiling of burnished gold, and a fountain in which a massive\n      nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia. Forty barbers and nine\n      manicure girls worked desperately, and at the door six colored porters\n      lurked to greet the customers, to care reverently for their hats and\n      collars, to lead them to a place of waiting where, on a carpet like a\n      tropic isle in the stretch of white stone floor, were a dozen leather\n      chairs and a table heaped with magazines.",
                "Babbitt's porter was an obsequious gray-haired negro who did him an honor\n      highly esteemed in the land of Zenith -- greeted him by name. Yet\n      Babbitt was unhappy. His bright particular manicure girl was engaged. She\n      was doing the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him. Babbitt\n      hated him. He thought of waiting, but to stop the powerful system of the\n      Pompeian was inconceivable, and he was instantly wafted into a chair.",
                "About him was luxury, rich and delicate. One votary was having a\n      violet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about\n      miraculous electrical massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming\n      towels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully\n      flung them away after a second's use. On the vast marble shelf facing the\n      chairs were hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and emerald. It was\n      flattering to Babbitt to have two personal slaves at once -- the barber\n      and the bootblack. He would have been completely happy if he could also\n      have had the manicure girl. The barber snipped at his hair and asked his\n      opinion of the Havre de Grace races, the baseball season, and Mayor Prout.\n      The young negro bootblack hummed \"The Camp Meeting Blues\" and polished in\n      rhythm to his tune, drawing the shiny shoe-rag so taut at each stroke that\n      it snapped like a banjo string. The barber was an excellent salesman. He\n      made Babbitt feel rich and important by his manner of inquiring, \"What is\n      your favorite tonic, sir? Have you time to-day, sir, for a facial massage?\n      Your scalp is a little tight; shall I give you a scalp massage?\"",
                "Babbitt's best thrill was in the shampoo. The barber made his hair creamy\n      with thick soap, then (as Babbitt bent over the bowl, muffled in towels)\n      drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp, and at last ran\n      the water ice-cold. At the shock, the sudden burning cold on his skull,\n      Babbitt's heart thumped, his chest heaved, and his spine was an electric\n      wire. It was a sensation which broke the monotony of life. He looked\n      grandly about the shop as he sat up. The barber obsequiously rubbed his\n      wet hair and bound it in a towel as in a turban, so that Babbitt resembled\n      a plump pink calif on an ingenious and adjustable throne. The barber\n      begged (in the manner of one who was a good fellow yet was overwhelmed by\n      the splendors of the calif), \"How about a little Eldorado Oil Rub, sir?\n      Very beneficial to the scalp, sir. Didn't I give you one the last time?\"",
                "He hadn't, but Babbitt agreed, \"Well, all right.\"",
                "With quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free.",
                "\"I don't know, I guess I'll have a manicure after all,\" he droned, and\n      excitedly watched her coming, dark-haired, smiling, tender, little. The\n      manicuring would have to be finished at her table, and he would be able to\n      talk to her without the barber listening. He waited contentedly, not\n      trying to peep at her, while she filed his nails and the barber shaved him\n      and smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which the\n      pleasant minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages. When\n      the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he admired\n      the marble slab of it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver\n      taps, and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a place.\n      When she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive from the\n      warm soapy water that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm\n      little paw. He delighted in the pinkness and glossiness of her nails. Her\n      hands seemed to him more adorable than Mrs. Judique's thin fingers, and\n      more elegant. He had a certain ecstasy in the pain when she gnawed at the\n      cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife. He struggled not to look at the\n      outline of her young bosom and her shoulders, the more apparent under a\n      film of pink chiffon. He was conscious of her as an exquisite thing, and\n      when he tried to impress his personality on her he spoke as awkwardly as a\n      country boy at his first party:",

                "\"Yes, maybe there's something to that. Course, that is -- with a pretty\n      kiddy like you, a man can't help coming to get his mitts done.\"",
                "\"Yeh, I may be a kid, but I'm a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I\n      see um -- I can read character at a glance -- and I'd never talk so\n      frank with a fellow if I couldn't see he was a nice fellow.\"",

They would have a pleasant drive, this hot lonely evening, and\n      he might hold her hand -- no, he wouldn't even do that.

                "Then his car broke down; something had happened to the ignition. And he\n      HAD to have the car this evening! Furiously he tested the spark-plugs,\n      stared at the commutator. His angriest glower did not seem to stir the\n      sulky car, and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage. With a renewed\n      thrill he thought of a taxicab. There was something at once wealthy and\n      interestingly wicked about a taxicab.",
                "But when he met her, on a corner two blocks from the Hotel Thornleigh, she\n      said, \"A taxi? Why, I thought you owned a car!\"",

Then she ran down the steps of the Inn, singing, \"Come on,\n      Georgie, we'll have a nice drive and get cool.\"",
                "It was a night of lovers. All along the highway into Zenith, under the low\n      and gentle moon, motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in\n      revery. He held out hungry hands to Ida, and when she patted them he was\n      grateful. There was no sense of struggle and transition; he kissed her and\n      simply she responded to his kiss, they two behind the stolid back of the\n      chauffeur.",

If you're a good boy, maybe I'll kiss you when we say\n      nighty-night. Now give me a cigarette.\"",
                "He was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her\n      comfort. Then he sat as far from her as possible. He was cold with\n      failure. No one could have told Babbitt that he was a fool with more\n      vigor, precision, and intelligence than he himself displayed. He reflected\n      that from the standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he was a\n      wicked man, and from the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old bore who\n      had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large dinner.",

                "He snorted, \"Huh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish? Now,\n      listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about this\n      scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I've had a lot of experience\n      with employees, and let me tell you it doesn't pay to antagonize -- \"",
                "At the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly and\n      amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying \"Oh, my God!\""

Why, he wondered, should he be\n      in rebellion?

                "He loitered down to the station; he studied the summer-resort posters,\n      lest he have to speak to acquaintances and expose his uneasiness. But he\n      was well trained. When the train clanked in he was out on the cement\n      platform, peering into the chair-cars, and as he saw her in the line of\n      passengers moving toward the vestibule he waved his hat. At the door he\n      embraced her, and announced, \"Well, well, well, well, by golly, you look\n      fine, you look fine.\" Then he was aware of Tinka. Here was something, this\n      child with her absurd little nose and lively eyes, that loved him,\n      believed him great, and as he clasped her, lifted and held her till she\n      squealed, he was for the moment come back to his old steady self.",

He saw\n      himself returning; finding peace there, and the presence of Paul, in a\n      life primitive and heroic. Like a shock came the thought that he actually\n      could go. Only, he couldn't, really; he couldn't leave his business, and\n      \"Myra would think it sort of funny, his going way off there alone. Course\n      he'd decided to do whatever he darned pleased, from now on, but still -- to\n      go way off to Maine!\"",

He said that he had to\n      see a man in New York on business. He could not have explained even to\n      himself why he drew from the bank several hundred dollars more than he\n      needed, nor why he kissed Tinka so tenderly, and cried, \"God bless you,\n      baby!\" From the train he waved to her till she was but a scarlet spot\n      beside the brown bulkier presence of Mrs. Babbitt, at the end of a steel\n      and cement aisle ending in vast barred gates. With melancholy he looked\n      back at the last suburb of Zenith.",
                "All the way north he pictured the Maine guides: simple and strong and\n      daring, jolly as they played stud-poker in their unceiled shack, wise in\n      woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids. He particularly\n      remembered Joe Paradise, half Yankee, half Indian. If he could but take up\n      a backwoods claim with a man like Joe, work hard with his hands, be free\n      and noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to this dull decency!",
                "Or, like a trapper in a Northern Canada movie, plunge through the forest,\n      make camp in the Rockies, a grim and wordless caveman! Why not? He COULD\n      do it! There'd be enough money at home for the family to live on till\n      Verona was married and Ted self-supporting. Old Henry T. would look out\n      for them. Honestly! Why NOT? Really LIVE --",
                "He longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed\n      that he was going to do it. Whenever common sense snorted, \"Nonsense!\n      Folks don't run away from decent families and partners; just simply don't\n      do it, that's all!\" then Babbitt answered pleadingly, \"Well, it wouldn't\n      take any more nerve than for Paul to go to jail and -- Lord, how I'd'\n*       like to do it! Moccasins -- six-gun -- frontier town -- gamblers -- sleep under\n      the stars -- be a regular man, with he-men like Joe Paradise -- gosh!\"",
                "So he came to Maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel, again\n      spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the pines\n      rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a sliding\n      circle. He hurried to the guides' shack as to his real home, his real\n      friends, long missed. They would be glad to see him. They would stand up\n      and shout? \"Why, here's Mr. Babbitt! He ain't one of these ordinary\n      sports! He's a real guy!\"",
                "In their boarded and rather littered cabin the guides sat about the greasy\n      table playing stud-poker with greasy cards: half a dozen wrinkled men in\n      old trousers and easy old felt hats. They glanced up and nodded. Joe\n      Paradise, the swart aging man with the big mustache, grunted, \"How do.\n      Back again?\"",
                "Silence, except for the clatter of chips.",
                "Babbitt stood beside them, very lonely. He hinted, after a period of\n      highly concentrated playing, \"Guess I might take a hand, Joe.\"",
                "\"Sure. Sit in. How many chips you want? Let's see; you were here with your\n      wife, last year, wa'n't you?\" said Joe Paradise.",
                "That was all of Babbitt's welcome to the old home.",
                "He played for half an hour before he spoke again. His head was reeking\n      with the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars, and he was weary of pairs and\n      four-flushes, resentful of the way in which they ignored him. He flung at\n      Joe:",

                "\"Nope.\"",
                "\"Like to guide me for a few days?\"",
                "\"Well, jus' soon. I ain't engaged till next week.\"",
                "Only thus did Joe recognize the friendship Babbitt was offering him.\n      Babbitt paid up his losses and left the shack rather childishly. Joe\n      raised his head from the coils of smoke like a seal rising from surf,\n      grunted, \"I'll come 'round t'morrow,\" and dived down to his three aces.",
                "Neither in his voiceless cabin, fragrant with planks of new-cut pine, nor\n      along the lake, nor in the sunset clouds which presently eddied behind the\n      lavender-misted mountains, could Babbitt find the spirit of Paul as a\n      reassuring presence. He was so lonely that after supper he stopped to talk\n      with an ancient old lady, a gasping and steadily discoursing old lady, by\n      the stove in the hotel-office. He told her of Ted's presumable future\n      triumphs in the State University and of Tinka's remarkable vocabulary till\n      he was homesick for the home he had left forever.",
                "Through the darkness, through that Northern pine-walled silence, he\n      blundered down to the lake-front and found a canoe. There were no paddles\n      in it but with a board, sitting awkwardly amidships and poking at the\n      water rather than paddling, he made his way far out on the lake. The\n      lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster of\n      glow-worms at the base of Sachem Mountain. Larger and ever more\n      imperturbable was the mountain in the star-filtered darkness, and the lake\n      a limitless pavement of black marble. He was dwarfed and dumb and a little\n      awed, but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of being Mr.\n      George F. Babbitt of Zenith; saddened and freed his heart. Now he was\n      conscious of the presence of Paul, fancied him (rescued from prison, from\n      Zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tar-roofing business) playing his\n      violin at the end of the canoe. He vowed, \"I will go on! I'll never go\n      back! Now that Paul's out of it, I don't want to see any of those damn\n      people again! I was a fool to get sore because Joe Paradise didn't jump up\n      and hug me. He's one of these woodsmen; too wise to go yelping and talking\n      your arm off like a cityman. But get him back in the mountains, out on the\n      trail -- ! That's real living!\"",
                "IV",
                "Joe reported at Babbitt's cabin at nine the next morning. Babbitt greeted\n      him as a fellow caveman:",
                "\"Well, Joe, how d' you feel about hitting the trail, and getting away from\n      these darn soft summerites and these women and all?\"",
                "\"All right, Mr. Babbitt.\"",
                "\"What do you say we go over to Box Car Pond -- they tell me the shack\n      there isn't being used -- and camp out?\"",
                "\"Well, all right, Mr. Babbitt, but it's nearer to Skowtuit Pond, and you\n      can get just about as good fishing there.\"",
                "\"No, I want to get into the real wilds.\"",
                "\"Well, all right.\"",
                "\"We'll put the old packs on our backs and get into the woods and really\n      hike.\"",
                "\"I think maybe it would be easier to go by water, through Lake Chogue. We\n      can go all the way by motor boat -- flat-bottom boat with an Evinrude.\"",
                "\"No, sir! Bust up the quiet with a chugging motor? Not on your life! You\n      just throw a pair of socks in the old pack, and tell 'em what you want for\n      eats. I'll be ready soon 's you are.\"",
                "\"Most of the sports go by boat, Mr. Babbitt. It's a long walk.",
                "\"Look here, Joe: are you objecting to walking?\"",
                "\"Oh, no, I guess I can do it. But I haven't tramped that far for sixteen\n      years. Most of the sports go by boat. But I can do it if you say so -- I\n      guess.\" Joe walked away in sadness.",
                "Babbitt had recovered from his touchy wrath before Joe returned. He\n      pictured him as warming up and telling the most entertaining stories. But\n      Joe had not yet warmed up when they took the trail. He persistently kept\n      behind Babbitt, and however much his shoulders ached from the pack,\n      however sorely he panted, Babbitt could hear his guide panting equally.\n      But the trail was satisfying: a path brown with pine-needles and rough\n      with roots, among the balsams, the ferns, the sudden groves of white\n      birch. He became credulous again, and rejoiced in sweating. When he\n      stopped to rest he chuckled, \"Guess we're hitting it up pretty good for a\n      couple o' old birds, eh?\"",
                "\"Uh-huh,\" admitted Joe.",
                "\"This is a mighty pretty place. Look, you can see the lake down through\n      the trees. I tell you, Joe, you don't appreciate how lucky you are to live\n      in woods like this, instead of a city with trolleys grinding and\n      typewriters clacking and people bothering the life out of you all the\n      time! I wish I knew the woods like you do. Say, what's the name of that\n      little red flower?\"",
                "Rubbing his back, Joe regarded the flower resentfully \"Well, some folks\n      call it one thing and some calls it another I always just call it Pink\n      Flower.\"",
                "Babbitt blessedly ceased thinking as tramping turned into blind plodding.\n      He was submerged in weariness. His plump legs seemed to go on by\n      themselves, without guidance, and he mechanically wiped away the sweat\n      which stung his eyes. He was too tired to be consciously glad as, after a\n      sun-scourged mile of corduroy tote-road through a swamp where flies\n      hovered over a hot waste of brush, they reached the cool shore of Box Car\n      Pond. When he lifted the pack from his back he staggered from the change\n      in balance, and for a moment could not stand erect. He lay beneath an\n      ample-bosomed maple tree near the guest-shack, and joyously felt sleep\n      running through his veins.",
                "He awoke toward dusk, to find Joe efficiently cooking bacon and eggs and\n      flapjacks for supper, and his admiration of the woodsman returned. He sat\n      on a stump and felt virile.",
                "\"Joe, what would you do if you had a lot of money? Would you stick to\n      guiding, or would you take a claim 'way back in the woods and be\n      independent of people?\"",
                "For the first time Joe brightened. He chewed his cud a second, and\n      bubbled, \"I've often thought of that! If I had the money, I'd go down to\n      Tinker's Falls and open a swell shoe store.\"",
                "After supper Joe proposed a game of stud-poker but Babbitt refused with\n      brevity, and Joe contentedly went to bed at eight. Babbitt sat on the\n      stump, facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. Save the snoring guide,\n      there was no other human being within ten miles. He was lonelier than he\n      had ever been in his life. Then he was in Zenith.",
                "He was worrying as to whether Miss McGoun wasn't paying too much for\n      carbon paper. He was at once resenting and missing the persistent teasing\n      at the Roughnecks' Table. He was wondering what Zilla Riesling was doing\n      now. He was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity of being a\n      garageman, Ted would \"get busy\" in the university. He was thinking of his\n      wife. \"If she would only -- if she wouldn't be so darn satisfied with\n      just settling down -- No! I won't! I won't go back! I'll be fifty in\n      three years. Sixty in thirteen years. I'm going to have some fun before\n      it's too late. I don't care! I will!\"",
                "He thought of Ida Putiak, of Louetta Swanson, of that nice widow -- what\n      was her name? -- Tanis Judique? -- the one for whom he'd found the\n      flat. He was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. Then:",
                "\"Gee, I can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!\"",
                "Thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never\n      run away from himself.",
                "That moment he started for Zenith. In his journey there was no appearance\n      of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was on the\n      Zenith train. He knew that he was slinking back not because it was what he\n      longed to do but because it was all he could do. He scanned again his\n      discovery that he could never run away from Zenith and family and office,\n      because in his own brain he bore the office and the family and every\n      street and disquiet and illusion of Zenith.",
                "\"But I'm going to -- oh, I'm going to start something!\" he vowed, and\n      he tried to make it valiant."

                "As he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only\n      one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who, after\n      the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of becoming a\n      corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed farmer-labor tickets and\n      fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion,\n      naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but\n      in all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly\n      he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum\n      Frink except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called\n      \"The Way of All Flesh.\" It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if\n      Doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.",
                "\"Why, hello, Doane,\" he said.",
                "Doane looked up. His voice was curiously kind. \"Oh! How do, Babbitt.\"",
                "\"Been away, eh?\"",
                "\"Yes, I've been in Washington.\"",
                "\"Washington, eh? How's the old Government making out?\"",
                "\"It's -- Won't you sit down?\"",
                "\"Thanks. Don't care if I do. Well, well! Been quite a while since I've had\n      a good chance to talk to you, Doane. I was, uh -- Sorry you didn't turn\n      up at the last class-dinner.\"",
                "\"Oh -- thanks.\"",
                "\"How's the unions coming? Going to run for mayor again?\" Doane seemed\n      restless. He was fingering the pages of his book. He said \"I might\" as\n      though it didn't mean anything in particular, and he smiled.",
                "Babbitt liked that smile, and hunted for conversation: \"Saw a bang-up\n      cabaret in New York: the 'Good-Morning Cutie' bunch at the Hotel Minton.\"",
                "\"Yes, they're pretty girls. I danced there one evening.\"",
                "\"Oh. Like dancing?\"",

                "\"But gosh, Doane, I thought you fellows wanted to take all the good eats\n      and everything away from us.\"",
                "\"No. Not at all. What I'd like to see is the meetings of the Garment\n      Workers held at the Ritz, with a dance afterward. Isn't that reasonable?\"",
                "\"Yuh, might be good idea, all right. Well -- Shame I haven't seen more\n      of you, recent years. Oh, say, hope you haven't held it against me, my\n      bucking you as mayor, going on the stump for Prout. You see, I'm an\n      organization Republican, and I kind of felt -- \"",
                "\"There's no reason why you shouldn't fight me. I have no doubt you're good\n      for the Organization. I remember -- in college you were an unusually\n      liberal, sensitive chap. I can still recall your saying to me that you\n      were going to be a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing, and\n      fight the rich.

                "\"Well.... Well.... I've always aimed to be liberal.\" Babbitt was\n      enormously shy and proud and self-conscious; he tried to look like the boy\n      he had been a quarter-century ago, and he shone upon his old friend Seneca\n      Doane as he rumbled, \"Trouble with a lot of these fellows, even the live\n      wires and some of 'em that think they're forward-looking, is they aren't\n      broad-minded and liberal.

                "\"That's fine.\"",

                "\"Yes -- \"",
                "\"I always say a fellow ought to have Vision and Ideals. I guess some of\n      the fellows in my business think I'm pretty visionary, but I just let 'em\n      think what they want to and go right on -- same as you do.... By golly,\n      this is nice to have a chance to sit and visit and kind of, you might say,\n      brush up on our ideals.\"",
                "\"But of course we visionaries do rather get beaten. Doesn't it bother\n      you?\"",
                "\"Not a bit! Nobody can dictate to me what I think!\"",
                "\"You're the man I want to help me. I want you to talk to some of the\n      business men and try to make them a little more liberal in their attitude\n      toward poor Beecher Ingram.\"",
                "\"Ingram? But, why, he's this nut preacher that got kicked out of the\n      Congregationalist Church, isn't he, and preaches free love and sedition?\"",
                "This, Doane explained, was indeed the general conception of Beecher\n      Ingram, but he himself saw Beecher Ingram as a priest of the brotherhood\n      of man, of which Babbitt was notoriously an upholder. So would Babbitt\n      keep his acquaintances from hounding Ingram and his forlorn little church?",
                "\"You bet! I'll call down any of the boys I hear getting funny about\n      Ingram,\" Babbitt said affectionately to his dear friend Doane.",
                "Doane warmed up and became reminiscent. He spoke of student days in\n      Germany, of lobbying for single tax in Washington, of international labor\n      conferences. He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood,\n      Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only\n      with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord\n      Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He\n      felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan.",
                "Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling,\n      and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never\n      could.",
                "II",
                "Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it was\n      in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and\n      forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but highly\n      benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca\n      Doane.",
                "He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her\n      as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her\n      boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district,\n      he stopped in discomfort. At an upper window, leaning on her elbow, was a\n      woman with the features of Zilla, but she was bloodless and aged, like a\n      yellowed wad of old paper crumpled into wrinkles. Where Zilla had bounced\n      and jiggled, this woman was dreadfully still.",
                "He waited half an hour before she came into the boarding-house parlor.\n      Fifty times he opened the book of photographs of the Chicago World's Fair\n      of 1893, fifty times he looked at the picture of the Court of Honor.",
                "He was startled to find Zilla in the room. She wore a black streaky gown\n      which she had tried to brighten with a girdle of crimson ribbon. The\n      ribbon had been torn and patiently mended. He noted this carefully,\n      because he did not wish to look at her shoulders. One shoulder was lower\n      than the other; one arm she carried in contorted fashion, as though it\n      were paralyzed; and behind a high collar of cheap lace there was a gouge\n      in the anemic neck which had once been shining and softly plump.",
                "\"Yes?\" she said.",
                "\"Well, well, old Zilla! By golly, it's good to see you again!\"",
                "\"He can send his messages through a lawyer.\"",
                "\"Why, rats, Zilla, I didn't come just because of him. Came as an old\n      friend.\"",
                "\"You waited long enough!\"",
                "\"Well, you know how it is. Figured you wouldn't want to see a friend of\n      his for quite some time and -- Sit down, honey! Let's be sensible.\n      We've all of us done a bunch of things that we hadn't ought to, but maybe\n      we can sort of start over again. Honest, Zilla, I'd like to do something\n      to make you both happy. Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn't\n      know a thing about this -- doesn't know I was going to come see you. I\n      got to thinking: Zilla's a fine? big-hearted woman, and she'll understand\n      that, uh, Paul's had his lesson now. Why wouldn't it be a fine idea if you\n      asked the governor to pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from you.\n      No! Wait! Just think how good you'd feel if you were generous.\"",
                "\"Yes, I wish to be generous.\" She was sitting primly, speaking icily. \"For\n      that reason I wish to keep him in prison, as an example to evil-doers.\n      I've gotten religion, George, since the terrible thing that man did to me.\n      Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly pleasures, for\n      dancing and the theater. But when I was in the hospital the pastor of the\n      Pentecostal Communion Faith used to come to see me, and he showed me,\n      right from the prophecies written in the Word of God, that the Day of\n      Judgment is coming and all the members of the older churches are going\n      straight to eternal damnation, because they only do lip-service and\n      swallow the world, the flesh, and the devil -- \"",
                "For fifteen wild minutes she talked, pouring out admonitions to flee the\n      wrath to come, and her face flushed, her dead voice recaptured something\n      of the shrill energy of the old Zilla. She wound up with a furious:",
                "\"It's the blessing of God himself that Paul should be in prison now, and\n      torn and humbled by punishment, so that he may yet save his soul, and so\n      other wicked men, these horrible chasers after women and lust, may have an\n      example.\"",
                "Babbitt had itched and twisted. As in church he dared not move during the\n      sermon so now he felt that he must seem attentive, though her screeching\n      denunciations flew past him like carrion birds.",
                "He sought to be calm and brotherly:",
                "\"Yes, I know, Zilla. But gosh, it certainly is the essence of religion to\n      be charitable, isn't it? Let me tell you how I figure it: What we need in\n      the world is liberalism, liberality, if we're going to get anywhere. I've\n      always believed in being broad-minded and liberal -- \"",
                "\"You? Liberal?\" It was very much the old Zilla. \"Why, George Babbitt,\n      you're about as broad-minded and liberal as a razor-blade!\"",
                "\"Oh, I am, am I! Well, just let me tell you, just -- let me -- tell -- you,\n      I'm as by golly liberal as you are religious, anyway! YOU RELIGIOUS!\"",
                "\"I am so! Our pastor says I sustain him in the faith!\"",
                "\"I'll bet you do! With Paul's money! But just to show you how liberal I\n      am, I'm going to send a check for ten bucks to this Beecher Ingram,\n      because a lot of fellows are saying the poor cuss preaches sedition and\n      free love, and they're trying to run him out of town.\"",
                "\"And they're right! They ought to run him out of town! Why, he preaches -- if\n      you can call it preaching -- in a theater, in the House of Satan! You\n      don't know what it is to find God, to find peace, to behold the snares\n      that the devil spreads out for our feet. Oh, I'm so glad to see the\n      mysterious purposes of God in having Paul harm me and stop my wickedness -- and\n      Paul's getting his, good and plenty, for the cruel things he did to me,\n      and I hope he DIES in prison!\"",
                "Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, \"Well, if that's what you call\n      being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me before you go to war, will\n      you?\"",

More than mountains\n      or the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character, imperturbable,\n      cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose.

Nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that\n      there was a new George F.

                "At home he grunted \"Eh?\" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,\n      and was delighted by Tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, \"No\n      class to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame one.\"",
                "Verona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his newspaper\n      Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against commission-houses. As a\n      result he had been given an excellent job in a commission-house, and he\n      was making a salary on which he could marry, and denouncing irresponsible\n      reporters who wrote stories criticizing commission-houses without knowing\n      what they were talking about.",
                "This September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the\n      College of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis only fifteen\n      miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was\n      worried. Ted was \"going in for\" everything but books. He had tried to\n      \"make\" the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to\n      the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and\n      (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being \"rushed\" by\n      two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a\n      mumbled, \"Oh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of\n      junk about literature and economics.\"",
                "One week-end Ted proposed, \"Say, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the\n      College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You\n      always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.\"",

                "There was much explanation of the \"dollars-and-cents value of being known\n      as a college man when you go into the law,\" and a truly oratorical account\n      of the lawyer's life. Before he was through with it, Babbitt had Ted a\n      United States Senator.",
                "Among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was Seneca Doane.",
                "\"But, gee whiz,\" Ted marveled, \"I thought you always said this Doane was a\n      reg'lar nut!\"",
                "\"That's no way to speak of a great man! Doane's always been a good friend\n      of mine -- fact I helped him in college -- I started him out and you\n      might say inspired him.

And you now, which would you rather\n      do: be in with a lot of greasy mechanics and laboring-men, or chum up to a\n      real fellow like Lord Wycombe, and get invited to his house for parties?\"",
                "\"Well -- gosh,\" sighed Ted.",

                "THE strike which turned Zenith into two belligerent camps; white and red,\n      began late in September with a walk-out of telephone girls and linemen, in\n      protest against a reduction of wages. The newly formed union of\n      dairy-products workers went out, partly in sympathy and partly in demand\n      for a forty-four hour week. They were followed by the truck-drivers'\n      union. Industry was tied up, and the whole city was nervous with talk of a\n      trolley strike, a printers' strike, a general strike. Furious citizens,\n      trying to get telephone calls through strike-breaking girls, danced\n      helplessly. Every truck that made its way from the factories to the\n      freight-stations was guarded by a policeman, trying to look stoical beside\n      the scab driver. A line of fifty trucks from the Zenith Steel and\n      Machinery Company was attacked by strikers-rushing out from the sidewalk,\n      pulling drivers from the seats, smashing carburetors and commutators,\n      while telephone girls cheered from the walk, and small boys heaved bricks.",
                "The National Guard was ordered out. Colonel Nixon, who in private life was\n      Mr. Caleb Nixon, secretary of the Pullmore Tractor Company, put on a long\n      khaki coat and stalked through crowds, a .44 automatic in hand. Even\n      Babbitt's friend, Clarence Drum the shoe merchant -- a round and merry\n      man who told stories at the Athletic Club, and who strangely resembled a\n      Victorian pug-dog -- was to be seen as a waddling but ferocious\n      captain, with his belt tight about his comfortable little belly, and his\n      round little mouth petulant as he piped to chattering groups on corners.\n      \"Move on there now! I can't have any of this loitering!\"",
                "Every newspaper in the city, save one, was against the strikers. When mobs\n      raided the news-stands, at each was stationed a militiaman, a young,\n      embarrassed citizen-soldier with eye-glasses, bookkeeper or grocery-clerk\n      in private life, trying to look dangerous while small boys yelped, \"Get\n      onto de tin soldier!\" and striking truck-drivers inquired tenderly, \"Say,\n      Joe, when I was fighting in France, was you in camp in the States or was\n      you doing Swede exercises in the Y.

                "He belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he\n      agreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when his\n      friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of going\n      to Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a\n      broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had\n      been hungry, he was troubled. \"All lies and fake figures,\" he said, but in\n      a doubtful croak.",
                "For the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a\n      sermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on \"How the Saviour Would End Strikes.\"\n       Babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the\n      service, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to what\n      the divine powers thought about strikes. Beside Babbitt in the large,\n      curving, glossy, velvet-upholstered pew was Chum Frink.",
                "Frink whispered, \"Hope the doc gives the strikers hell! Ordinarily, I\n      don't believe in a preacher butting into political matters -- let him\n      stick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir up a lot of\n      discussion -- but at a time like this, I do think he ought to stand\n      right up and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!\"",
                "\"Yes -- well -- \" said Babbitt.",
                "The Rev. Dr. Drew, his rustic bang flopping with the intensity of his\n      poetic and sociologic ardor, trumpeted:",
                "\"During the untoward series of industrial dislocations which have -- let\n      us be courageous and admit it boldly -- throttled the business life of\n      our fair city these past days, there has been a great deal of loose talk\n      about scientific prevention of scientific -- SCIENTIFIC! Now, let me\n      tell you that the most unscientific thing in the world is science! Take\n      the attacks on the established fundamentals of the Christian creed which\n      were so popular with the 'scientists' a generation ago. Oh, yes, they were\n      mighty fellows, and great poo-bahs of criticism! They were going to\n      destroy the church; they were going to prove the world was created and has\n      been brought to its extraordinary level of morality and civilization by\n      blind chance. Yet the church stands just as firmly to-day as ever, and the\n      only answer a Christian pastor needs make to the long-haired opponents of\n      his simple faith is just a pitying smile!",
                "\"And now these same 'scientists' want to replace the natural condition of\n      free competition by crazy systems which, no matter by what high-sounding\n      names they are called, are nothing but a despotic paternalism. Naturally,\n      I'm not criticizing labor courts, injunctions against men proven to be\n      striking unjustly, or those excellent unions in which the men and the boss\n      get together. But I certainly am criticizing the systems in which the free\n      and fluid motivation of independent labor is to be replaced by cooked-up\n      wage-scales and minimum salaries and government commissions and labor\n      federations and all that poppycock.",
                "\"What is not generally understood is that this whole industrial matter\n      isn't a question of economics. It's essentially and only a matter of Love,\n      and of the practical application of the Christian religion! Imagine a\n      factory -- instead of committees of workmen alienating the boss, the\n      boss goes among them smiling, and they smile back, the elder brother and\n      the younger. Brothers, that's what they must be, loving brothers, and then\n      strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home!\"",
                "It was at this point that Babbitt muttered, \"Oh, rot!\"",

When Babbitt drove west from his\n      office at ten that morning he saw a drove of shabby men heading toward the\n      tangled, dirty district beyond Court House Square. He hated them, because\n      they were poor, because they made him feel insecure. \"Damn loafers!\n      Wouldn't be common workmen if they had any pep,\" he complained. He\n      wondered if there was going to be a riot. He drove toward the\n      starting-point of the parade, a triangle of limp and faded grass known as\n      Moore Street Park, and halted his car.",
                "The park and streets were buzzing with strikers, young men in blue denim\n      shirts, old men with caps. Through them, keeping them stirred like a\n      boiling pot, moved the militiamen. Babbitt could hear the soldiers'\n      monotonous orders: \"Keep moving -- move on, 'bo -- keep your feet\n      warm!\" Babbitt admired their stolid good temper. The crowd shouted, \"Tin\n      soldiers,\" and \"Dirty dogs -- servants of the capitalists!\" but the\n      militiamen grinned and answered only, \"Sure, that's right. Keep moving,\n      Billy!\"",
                "Babbitt thrilled over the citizen-soldiers, hated the scoundrels who were\n      obstructing the pleasant ways of prosperity, admired Colonel Nixon's\n      striding contempt for the crowd; and as Captain Clarence Drum, that rather\n      puffing shoe-dealer, came raging by, Babbitt respectfully clamored, \"Great\n      work, Captain! Don't let 'em march!\" He watched the strikers filing from\n      the park. Many of them bore posters with \"They can't stop our peacefully\n      walking.\" The militiamen tore away the posters, but the strikers fell in\n      behind their leaders and straggled off, a thin unimpressive trickle\n      between steel-glinting lines of soldiers. Babbitt saw with disappointment\n      that there wasn't going to be any violence, nothing interesting at all.\n      Then he gasped.",
                "Among the marchers, beside a bulky young workman, was Seneca Doane,\n      smiling, content. In front of him was Professor Brockbank, head of the\n      history department in the State University, an old man and white-bearded,\n      known to come from a distinguished Massachusetts family.",
                "\"Why, gosh,\" Babbitt marveled, \"a swell like him in with the strikers? And\n      good ole Senny Doane! They're fools to get mixed up with this bunch.\n      They're parlor socialists! But they have got nerve. And nothing in it for\n      them, not a cent!

                "At the Athletic Club, Babbitt was silent during lunch, while the others\n      fretted, \"I don't know what the world's coming to,\" or solaced their\n      spirits with \"kidding.\"",

Tanis ventured, \"I know you'll understand -- I mean -- I\n      don't quite know how to say it, but I do think that girls who pretend\n      they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. They give\n      away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman.\"",
                "Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,\n      Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used\n      him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike:",
                "\"See how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a\n      standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side.\n      For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't\n      you think so?\"",
                "\"Oh, I do!\" Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside\n      her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being\n      appreciated he proclaimed:",

Once he said\n      delicately, \"I do hate these guys -- I hate these people that invite\n      themselves to meals, but I seem to have a feeling I'm going to have supper\n      with the lovely Mrs. Tanis Judique to-night.

In the dimness they\n      talked of themselves; of how lonely she was, how bewildered he, and how\n      wonderful that they had found each other. As they fell silent the room was\n      stiller than a country lane. There was no sound from the street save the\n      whir of motor-tires, the rumble of a distant freight-train. Self-contained\n      was the room, warm, secure, insulated from the harassing world.",
                "He was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were smoothed\n      away; and when he reached home, at dawn, the rapture had mellowed to\n      contentment serene and full of memories."

He even praised Seneca Doane. Professor Pumphrey\n      said that was carrying a joke too far; but Babbitt argued, \"No! Fact! I\n      tell you he's got one of the keenest intellects in the country. Why, Lord\n      Wycombe said that -- \"",

I've dreamed of her all these\n      years and now I've found her!\" he exulted. He met her at the movies in the\n      morning; he drove out to her flat in the late afternoon or on evenings\n      when he was believed to be at the Elks. He knew her financial affairs and\n      advised her about them, while she lamented her feminine ignorance, and\n      praised his masterfulness, and proved to know much more about bonds than\n      he did. They had remembrances, and laughter over old times. Once they\n      quarreled, and he raged that she was as \"bossy\" as his wife and far more\n      whining when he was inattentive. But that passed safely.",
                "Their high hour was a tramp on a ringing December afternoon, through\n      snow-drifted meadows down to the icy Chaloosa River. She was exotic in an\n      astrachan cap and a short beaver coat; she slid on the ice and shouted,\n      and he panted after her, rotund with laughter.... Myra Babbitt never slid\n      on the ice.",
                "He was afraid that they would be seen together. In Zenith it is impossible\n      to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being known, before\n      nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was beautifully\n      discreet. However appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone,\n      she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he hoped that she\n      would be taken for a client. Orville Jones once saw them emerging from a\n      movie theater, and Babbitt bumbled, \"Let me make you 'quainted with Mrs.\n      Judique. Now here's a lady who knows the right broker to come to, Orvy!\"\n       Mr. Jones, though he was a man censorious of morals and of laundry\n      machinery, seemed satisfied.",

For years she had been\n      bored by anything more affectionate than a farewell kiss, yet she was hurt\n      by any slackening in his irritable periodic interest, and now he had no\n      interest; rather, a revulsion. He was completely faithful -- to Tanis.\n      He was distressed by the sight of his wife's slack plumpness, by her puffs\n      and billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was always\n      meaning and always forgetting to throw away. But he was aware that she, so\n      long attuned to him, caught all his repulsions. He elaborately, heavily,\n      jocularly tried to check them. He couldn't.",
                "They had a tolerable Christmas. Kenneth Escott was there, admittedly\n      engaged to Verona. Mrs. Babbitt was tearful and called Kenneth her new\n      son. Babbitt was worried about Ted, because he had ceased complaining of\n      the State University and become suspiciously acquiescent. He wondered what\n      the boy was planning, and was too shy to ask. Himself, Babbitt slipped\n      away on Christmas afternoon to take his present, a silver cigarette-box,\n      to Tanis. When he returned Mrs. Babbitt asked, much too innocently, \"Did\n      you go out for a little fresh air?\"",

Nor was Babbitt one of the detachable husbands\n      who take separations casually. He liked to have her there; she looked after\n      his clothes; she knew how his steak ought to be cooked; and her clucking\n      made him feel secure. But he could not drum up even a dutiful \"Oh, she\n      doesn't really need you, does she?\" While he tried to look regretful,\n      while he felt that his wife was watching him, he was filled with exultant\n      visions of Tanis.",

Each morning he gloomily recognized his\n      idiocies of the evening before. With his head throbbing, his tongue and\n      lips stinging from cigarettes, he incredulously counted the number of\n      drinks he had taken, and groaned, \"I got to quit!\" He had ceased saying,\n      \"I WILL quit!\" for however resolute he might be at dawn, he could not, for\n      a single evening, check his drift.",

                "\"Oh, isn't this dandy!\" she gabbled at him. \"Carrie Nork had the loveliest\n      idea. She decided it was time for a party, and she 'phoned the Bunch and\n      told 'em to gather round. . . . George, this is Carrie.\"",
                "\"Carrie\" was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly and\n      spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing\n      ash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous. She greeted\n      Babbitt with a giggling \"Welcome to our little midst! Tanis says you're a\n      real sport.\"",
                "He was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with Carrie, and\n      he did his unforgiving best. He towed her about the room, bumping into\n      other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly ambushed. As\n      he danced he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young woman who looked\n      capable, conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom he could never quite\n      remember. Three overdressed and slightly effeminate young men -- soda-fountain\n      clerks, or at least born for that profession. A man of his own age,\n      immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt's presence.",
                "When he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged,\n      \"Dear, wouldn't you like to do something for me? I'm all out of booze, and\n      the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey\n      Hanson's and get some?\"",
                "\"Sure,\" he said, trying not to sound sullen.",
                "\"I'll tell you: I'll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you.\" Tanis was\n      pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman.",
                "Miss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent \"How d'you do, Mr. Babbitt.\n      Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being\n      allowed to drive with you. Of course I'm not accustomed to associating\n      with society people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted\n      circles!\"",
                "Thus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson's. To her jibes\n      he wanted to reply \"Oh, go to the devil!\" but he never quite nerved\n      himself to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the existence of the\n      whole Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of \"darling Carrie\" and \"Min Sonntag -- she's\n      so clever -- you'll adore her,\" but they had never been real to him. He\n      had pictured Tanis as living in a rose-tinted vacuum, waiting for him,\n      free of all the complications of a Floral Heights.",
                "When they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young\n      soda-clerks. They were as damply friendly as Miss Sonntag was dryly\n      hostile. They called him \"Old Georgie\" and shouted, \"Come on now, sport;\n      shake a leg\" . . . boys in belted coats, pimply boys, as young as Ted and\n      as flabby as chorus-men, but powerful to dance and to mind the phonograph\n      and smoke cigarettes and patronize Tanis. He tried to be one of them; he\n      cried \"Good work, Pete!\" but his voice creaked.",
                "Tanis apparently enjoyed the companionship of the dancing darlings; she\n      bridled to their bland flirtation and casually kissed them at the end of\n      each dance. Babbitt hated her, for the moment. He saw her as middle-aged.\n      He studied the wrinkles in the softness of her throat, the slack flesh\n      beneath her chin. The taut muscles of her youth were loose and drooping.\n      Between dances she sat in the largest chair, waving her cigarette,\n      summoning her callow admirers to come and talk to her. (\"She thinks she's\n      a blooming queen!\" growled Babbitt.) She chanted to Miss Sonntag, \"Isn't\n      my little studio sweet?\" (\"Studio, rats! It's a plain\n      old-maid-and-chow-dog flat! Oh, God, I wish I was home! I wonder if I\n      can't make a getaway now?\")",
                "His vision grew blurred, however, as he applied himself to Healey Hanson's\n      raw but vigorous whisky. He blended with the Bunch. He began to rejoice\n      that Carrie Nork and Pete, the most nearly intelligent of the nimble\n      youths, seemed to like him; and it was enormously important to win over\n      the surly older man, who proved to be a railway clerk named Fulton Bemis.",
                "The conversation of the Bunch was exclamatory, high-colored, full of\n      references to people whom Babbitt did not know. Apparently they thought\n      very comfortably of themselves. They were the Bunch, wise and beautiful\n      and amusing; they were Bohemians and urbanites, accustomed to all the\n      luxuries of Zenith: dance-halls, movie-theaters, and roadhouses; and in a\n      cynical superiority to people who were \"slow\" or \"tightwad\" they cackled:",
                "\"Oh, Pete, did I tell you what that dub of a cashier said when I came in\n      late yesterday? Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!\"",
                "\"Oh, but wasn't T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did Gladys\n      say to him?\"",
                "\"Think of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his\n      house! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I call\n      it!\"",
                "\"Did you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn't she the limit!\"",
                "Babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss\n      Minnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz\n      music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared \"You bet!\" when\n      Mrs. Carrie Nork gurgled, \"Don't you love to sit on the floor? It's so\n      Bohemian!\" He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he\n      mentioned his friends Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington\n      Eathorne, and Chum Frink, he was proud of their condescending interest. He\n      got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn't much mind seeing\n      Tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the\n      young men, and he himself desired to hold Carrie Nork's pulpy hand, and\n      dropped it only because Tanis looked angry.",
                "When he went home, at two, he was fully a member of the Bunch, and all the\n      week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly straitened conventions,\n      the exceedingly wearing demands, of their life of pleasure and freedom. He\n      had to go to their parties; he was involved in the agitation when\n      everybody telephoned to everybody else that she hadn't meant what she'd\n      said when she'd said that, and anyway, why was Pete going around saying\n      she'd said it?",
                "Never was a Family more insistent on learning one another's movements than\n      were the Bunch. All of them volubly knew, or indignantly desired to know,\n      where all the others had been every minute of the week. Babbitt found\n      himself explaining to Carrie or Fulton Bemis just what he had been doing\n      that he should not have joined them till ten o'clock, and apologizing for\n      having gone to dinner with a business acquaintance.",
                "Every member of the Bunch was expected to telephone to every other member\n      at least once a week. \"Why haven't you called me up?\" Babbitt was asked\n      accusingly, not only by Tanis and Carrie but presently by new ancient\n      friends, Jennie and Capitolina and Toots.",
                "If for a moment he had seen Tanis as withering and sentimental, he lost\n      that impression at Carrie Nork's dance. Mrs. Nork had a large house and a\n      small husband. To her party came all of the Bunch, perhaps thirty-five of\n      them when they were completely mobilized. Babbitt, under the name of \"Old\n      Georgie,\" was now a pioneer of the Bunch, since each month it changed half\n      its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days of a fortnight\n      ago, before Mrs. Absolom, the food-demonstrator, had gone to Indianapolis,\n      and Mac had \"got sore at\" Minnie, was a venerable leader and able to\n      condescend to new Petes and Minnies and Gladyses.",
                "At Carrie's, Tanis did not have to work at being hostess. She was\n      dignified and sure, a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he had\n      always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was able\n      to sit quietly with her. He repented of his first revulsion, mooned at her\n      feet, and happily drove her home. Next day he bought a violent yellow tie,\n      to make himself young for her. He knew, a little sadly, that he could not\n      make himself beautiful; he beheld himself as heavy, hinting of fatness,\n      but he danced, he dressed, he chattered, to be as young as she was . . .\n      as young as she seemed to be.",
                "IV",
                "As all converts, whether to a religion, love, or gardening, find as by\n      magic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist, now the\n      whole world is filled with their fury, so, once he was converted to\n      dissipation, Babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it everywhere.",
                "He had a new view of his sporting neighbor, Sam Doppelbrau. The\n      Doppelbraus were respectable people, industrious people, prosperous\n      people, whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret. Their life was\n      dominated by suburban bacchanalia of alcohol, nicotine, gasoline, and\n      kisses. They and their set worked capably all the week, and all week\n      looked forward to Saturday night, when they would, as they expressed it,\n      \"throw a party;\" and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to\n      Sunday dawn, and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to\n      nowhere in particular.",
                "One evening when Tanis was at the theater, Babbitt found himself being\n      lively with the Doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he had for\n      years privily denounced to Mrs. Babbitt as a \"rotten bunch of tin-horns\n      that I wouldn't go out with, not if they were the last people on earth.\"\n       That evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in front of the\n      house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil footprints, made\n      by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow. Howard Littlefield came\n      up snuffling.",
                "\"Still a widower, George?\"",
                "\"Yump. Cold again to-night.\"",
                "\"What do you hear from the wife?\"",
                "\"She's feeling fine, but her sister is still pretty sick.\"",
                "\"Say, better come in and have dinner with us to-night, George.\"",
                "\"Oh -- oh, thanks. Have to go out.\"",
                "Suddenly he could not endure Littlefield's recitals of the more\n      interesting statistics about totally uninteresting problems. He scraped at\n      the walk and grunted.",
                "Sam Doppelbrau appeared.",
                "\"Evenin', Babbitt. Working hard?\"",
                "\"Yuh, lil exercise.\"",
                "\"Cold enough for you to-night?\"",
                "\"Well, just about.\"",
                "\"Still a widower?\"",
                "\"Uh-huh.\"",
                "\"Say, Babbitt, while she's away -- I know you don't care much for\n      booze-fights, but the Missus and I'd be awfully glad if you could come in\n      some night. Think you could stand a good cocktail for once?\"",
                "\"Stand it? Young fella, I bet old Uncle George can mix the best cocktail\n      in these United States!\"",
                "\"Hurray! That's the way to talk! Look here: There's some folks coming to\n      the house to-night, Louetta Swanson and some other live ones, and I'm\n      going to open up a bottle of pre-war gin, and maybe we'll dance a while.\n      Why don't you drop in and jazz it up a little, just for a change?\"",
                "\"Well -- What time they coming?\"",
                "He was at Sam Doppelbrau's at nine. It was the third time he had entered\n      the house. By ten he was calling Mr. Doppelbrau \"Sam, old hoss.\"",
                "At eleven they all drove out to the Old Farm Inn. Babbitt sat in the back\n      of Doppelbrau's car with Louetta Swanson. Once he had timorously tried to\n      make love to her. Now he did not try; he merely made love; and Louetta\n      dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger Eddie was, and\n      accepted Babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.",
                "With the assistance of Tanis's Bunch, the Doppelbraus, and other\n      companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when\n      he did not return home late and shaky. With his other faculties blurred he\n      yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could scarce\n      walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars. He\n      came wambling into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were about, he\n      got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their level young\n      glances, and hid himself up-stairs. He found when he came into the warm\n      house that he was hazier than he had believed. His head whirled. He dared\n      not lie down. He tried to soak out the alcohol in a hot bath. For the\n      moment his head was clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his\n      calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged down the towels,\n      and knocked over the soap-dish with a clatter which, he feared, would\n      betray him to the children. Chilly in his dressing-gown he tried to read\n      the evening paper. He could follow every word; he seemed to take in the\n      sense of things; but a minute afterward he could not have told what he had\n      been reading. When he went to bed his brain flew in circles, and he\n      hastily sat up, struggling for self-control. At last he was able to lie\n      still, feeling only a little sick and dizzy -- and enormously ashamed.\n      To hide his \"condition\" from his own children! To have danced and shouted\n      with people whom he despised! To have said foolish things, sung idiotic\n      songs, tried to kiss silly girls! Incredulously he remembered that he had\n      by his roaring familiarity with them laid himself open to the patronizing\n      of youths whom he would have kicked out of his office; that by dancing too\n      ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering\n      women. As it came relentlessly back to him he snarled, \"I hate myself! God\n      how I hate myself!\" But, he raged, \"I'm through! No more! Had enough,\n      plenty!\"",
                "He was even surer about it the morning after, when he was trying to be\n      grave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was\n      less sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as\n      clearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going\n      back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He kept a\n      whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his\n      drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing\n      friends, and by six he was with them . . . and the tale was to be told all\n      over.",
                "Each morning his head ached a little less. A bad head for drinks had been\n      his safeguard, but the safeguard was crumbling. Presently he could be\n      drunk at dawn, yet not feel particularly wretched in his conscience -- or\n      in his stomach -- when he awoke at eight. No regret, no desire to\n      escape the toil of keeping up with the arduous merriment of the Bunch, was\n      so great as his feeling of social inferiority when he failed to keep up.\n      To be the \"livest\" of them was as much his ambition now as it had been to\n      excel at making money, at playing golf, at motor-driving, at oratory, at\n      climbing to the McKelvey set. But occasionally he failed.",
                "He found that Pete and the other young men considered the Bunch too\n      austerely polite and the Carrie who merely kissed behind doors too\n      embarrassingly monogamic. As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to\n      the Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch\n      off to \"times\" with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department\n      stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There\n      was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking\n      cash-girl from Parcher and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was\n      apparently expected to \"jolly her along,\" but when she sang out, \"Hey,\n      leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage,\" he did not quite know how to go\n      on. They sat in the back room of a saloon, and Babbitt had a headache, was\n      confused by their new slang, looked at them benevolently, wanted to go\n      home, and had a drink -- a good many drinks.",
                "Two evenings after, Fulton Bemis, the surly older man of the Bunch, took\n      Babbitt aside and grunted, \"Look here, it's none of my business, and God\n      knows I always lap up my share of the hootch, but don't you think you\n      better watch yourself? You're one of these enthusiastic chumps that always\n      overdo things. D' you realize you're throwing in the booze as fast as you\n      can, and you eat one cigarette right after another? Better cut it out for\n      a while.\"",
                "Babbitt tearfully said that good old Fult was a prince, and yes, he\n      certainly would cut it out, and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and took\n      a drink and had a terrific quarrel with Tanis when she caught him being\n      affectionate with Carrie Nork.",
                "Next morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position\n      where a fifteenth-rater like Fulton Bemis could rebuke him. He perceived\n      that, since he was making love to every woman possible, Tanis was no\n      longer his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been\n      anything more to him than A Woman. And if Bemis had spoken to him, were\n      other people talking about him? He suspiciously watched the men at the\n      Athletic Club that noon. It seemed to him that they were uneasy. They had\n      been talking about him then? He was angry. He became belligerent. He not\n      only defended Seneca Doane but even made fun of the Y. M. C. A. Vergil\n      Gunch was rather brief in his answers.",
                "Afterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He did not go to the next\n      lunch of the Boosters' Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and, while he\n      munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on the arm of\n      his chair, he worried.",
                "Four days later, when the Bunch were having one of their best parties,\n      Babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the\n      Chaloosa River. After a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice. Down\n      those wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden\n      houses, and the whole Bellevue district seemed a frontier town. Even with\n      skid chains on all four wheels, Babbitt was afraid of sliding, and when he\n      came to the long slide of a hill he crawled down, both brakes on. Slewing\n      round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them\n      with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the Bunch -- Tanis,\n      Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis -- shouted \"Oh, baby,\" and waved\n      their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor\n      Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, Staring owlishly at the\n      revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis kiss him\n      as she crowed, \"You're such a good driver!\"",
                "At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with \"Out last night with my brother\n      and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I\n      saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.\"",
                "\"No, I wasn't -- I didn't see you,\" said Pumphrey, hastily, rather\n      guiltily.",
                "Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel\n      Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat\n      had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of\n      her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be\n      seen with her except at the movies. He thought of taking her to the\n      \"ladies' annex\" of the Athletic Club, but that was too dangerous. He would\n      have to introduce her and, oh, people might misunderstand and -- He\n      compromised on the Thornleigh.",
                "She was unusually smart, all in black: small black tricorne hat, short\n      black caracul coat, loose and swinging, and austere high-necked black\n      velvet frock at a time when most street costumes were like evening gowns.\n      Perhaps she was too smart. Every one in the gold and oak restaurant of the\n      Thornleigh was staring at her as Babbitt followed her to a table. He\n      uneasily hoped that the head-waiter would give them a discreet place\n      behind a pillar, but they were stationed on the center aisle. Tanis seemed\n      not to notice her admirers; she smiled at Babbitt with a lavish \"Oh, isn't\n      this nice! What a peppy-looking orchestra!\" Babbitt had difficulty in\n      being lavish in return, for two tables away he saw Vergil Gunch. All\n      through the meal Gunch watched them, while Babbitt watched himself being\n      watched and lugubriously tried to keep from spoiling Tanis's gaiety. \"I\n      felt like a spree to-day,\" she rippled. \"I love the Thornleigh, don't you?\n      It's so live and yet so -- so refined.\"",
                "He made talk about the Thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he\n      recognized in the restaurant, all but Vergil Gunch. There did not seem to\n      be anything else to talk of. He smiled conscientiously at her fluttering\n      jests; he agreed with her that Minnie Sonntag was \"so hard to get along\n      with,\" and young Pete \"such a silly lazy kid, really just no good at all.\"\n       But he himself had nothing to say. He considered telling her his worries\n      about Gunch, but -- \"oh, gosh, it was too much work to go into the\n      whole thing and explain about Verg and everything.\"",
                "He was relieved when he put Tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the\n      familiar simplicities of his office.",
                "At four o'clock Vergil Gunch called on him.",
                "Babbitt was agitated, but Gunch began in a friendly way:",
                "\"How's the boy? Say, some of us are getting up a scheme we'd kind of like\n      to have you come in on.\"",
                "\"Fine, Verg. Shoot.\"",
                "\"You know during the war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and\n      walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights, and\n      so did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about the\n      danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working underground\n      again, especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well, it's up to the\n      folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep\n      bucking these fellows. Some guy back East has organized a society called\n      the Good Citizens' League for just that purpose. Of course the Chamber of\n      Commerce and the American Legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the\n      decent people in the saddle, but they're devoted to so many other causes\n      that they can't attend to this one problem properly. But the Good\n      Citizens' League, the G. C. L., they stick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L.\n      has to have some other ostensible purposes -- frinstance here in Zenith\n      I think it ought to support the park-extension project and the City\n      Planning Committee -- and then, too, it should have a social aspect,\n      being made up of the best people -- have dances and so on, especially\n      as one of the best ways it can put the kibosh on cranks is to apply this\n      social boycott business to folks big enough so you can't reach 'em\n      otherwise. Then if that don't work, the G. C.

There was but one difference: the problem of remaining a respectable\n      husband, a Floral Heights husband, yet seeing Tanis and the Bunch with\n      frequency. He had promised to telephone to Tanis that evening, and now it\n      was melodramatically impossible. He prowled about the telephone,\n      impulsively thrusting out a hand to lift the receiver, but never quite\n      daring to risk it. Nor could he find a reason for slipping down to the\n      drug store on Smith Street, with its telephone-booth. He was laden with\n      responsibility till he threw it off with the speculation: \"Why the deuce\n      should I fret so about not being able to 'phone Tanis? She can get along\n      without me.

He still made\n      pretense of going to the Elks and to committee-meetings but less and less\n      did he trouble to have his excuses interesting, less and less did she\n      affect to believe them.

He recalled their high lights: the summer\n      vacation in Virginia meadows under the blue wall of the mountains; their\n      motor tour through Ohio, and the exploration of Cleveland, Cincinnati, and\n      Columbus; the birth of Verona; their building of this new house, planned\n      to comfort them through a happy old age -- chokingly they had said that\n      it might be the last home either of them would ever have.

The newspapers often chronicled his operations; he\n      was professor of surgery in the State University; he went to dinner at the\n      very best houses on Royal Ridge; and he was said to be worth several\n      hundred thousand dollars.

He wasn't asked.\n      They ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League and beg\n      in, and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had \"gotten away with\n      bucking the whole city.

He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss\n      Havstad's given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed\n      improbable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a\n      digestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede,\n      that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat\n      hash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought, each\n      evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her too-slim,\n      too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her typing was\n      perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her. She made\n      him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she looked gently\n      inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought of writing to\n      her.",

                "Gray fear loomed always by him now. He watched Fritz Weilinger, the young\n      salesman, and wondered if he too would leave. Daily he fancied slights. He\n      noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual Chamber of Commerce\n      dinner. When Orville Jones gave a large poker party and he was not\n      invited, he was certain that he had been snubbed. He was afraid to go to\n      lunch at the Athletic Club, and afraid not to go. He believed that he was\n      spied on; that when he left the table they whispered about him. Everywhere\n      he heard the rustling whispers: in the offices of clients, in the bank\n      when he made a deposit, in his own office, in his own home. Interminably\n      he wondered what They were saying of him. All day long in imaginary\n      conversations he caught them marveling, \"Babbitt? Why, say, he's a regular\n      anarchist! You got to admire the fellow for his nerve, the way he turned\n      liberal and, by golly, just absolutely runs his life to suit himself, but\n      say, he's dangerous, that's what he is, and he's got to be shown up.\"",
                "He was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two\n      acquaintances talking -- whispering -- his heart leaped, and he\n      stalked by like an embarrassed schoolboy. When he saw his neighbors Howard\n      Littlefield and Orville Jones together, he peered at them, went indoors to\n      escape their spying, and was miserably certain that they had been\n      whispering -- plotting -- whispering.",
                "Through all his fear ran defiance. He felt stubborn. Sometimes he decided\n      that he had been a very devil of a fellow, as bold as Seneca Doane;\n      sometimes he planned to call on Doane and tell him what a revolutionist he\n      was, and never got beyond the planning. But just as often, when he heard\n      the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, \"Good Lord, what have I done?\n      Just played with the Bunch, and called down Clarence Drum about being such\n      a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch ME criticizing people and trying to\n      make them accept MY ideas!\"",
                "He could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would like\n      to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a decent\n      and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be forced\n      back; he would not, he swore, \"eat dirt.\"",
                "Only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise\n      to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't\n      understand why he did not want to \"drop in at the Littlefields'\" for the\n      evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of\n      his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one\n      to whom he could talk. \"Good Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have,\n      these days,\" he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with\n      her all evening.",
                "He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt\n      note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for\n      whom he was longing.",
                "\"I thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need\n      her, Lord how I need her!\" he raged. \"Myra simply can't understand. All\n      she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But\n      Tanis, she'd tell me I was all right.\"",
                "Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not\n      dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis.\n      She was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like\n      Tanis. She said, \"Yes, George, what is it?\" in even and uninterested\n      tones, and he crept away, whipped.",
                "His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.",
                "They danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and Ted\n      chuckled, \"What's this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says you\n      raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give 'em fits! Stir 'em\n      up! This old burg is asleep!\" Eunice plumped down on Babbitt's lap, kissed\n      him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed; \"I think you're\n      lots nicer than Howard. Why is it,\" confidentially, \"that Howard is such\n      an old grouch? The man has a good heart, and honestly, he's awfully\n      bright, but he never will learn to step on the gas, after all the training\n      I've given him. Don't you think we could do something with him, dearest?\"",
                "\"Why, Eunice, that isn't a nice way to speak of your papa,\" Babbitt\n      observed, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for the\n      first time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal\n      strengthened by the loyalty of the young generation. They went out to\n      rifle the ice-box. Babbitt gloated, \"If your mother caught us at this,\n      we'd certainly get our come-uppance!\" and Eunice became maternal,\n      scrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the ear,\n      and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, \"It beats the devil why\n      feminists like me still go on nursing these men!\"",
                "Thus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon Smeeth,\n      educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the Chatham Road\n      Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned Babbitt's thick paw\n      while he chanted, \"Brother Babbitt, we haven't seen you at church very\n      often lately. I know you're busy with a multitude of details, but you\n      mustn't forget your dear friends at the old church home.\"",
                "Babbitt shook off the affectionate clasp -- Sheldy liked to hold hands\n      for a long time -- and snarled, \"Well, I guess you fellows can run the\n      show without me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day.\"",
                "But afterward he winced, \"If that white worm had the nerve to try to drag\n      me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been doing\n      a lot of talking about me, too.\"",
                "He heard them whispering -- whispering -- Dr. John Jennison Drew,\n      Cholmondeley Frink, even William Washington Eathorne. The independence\n      seeped out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men's cynical\n      eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering."

He heard her groan again. Instantly he was up,\n      soothing her, \"Still pretty bad, honey?\"",
                "\"Yes, it just gripes me, and I can't get to sleep.\"",
                "Her voice was faint. He knew her dread of doctors' verdicts and he did not\n      inform her, but he creaked down-stairs, telephoned to Dr. Earl Patten, and\n      waited, shivering, trying with fuzzy eyes to read a magazine, till he\n      heard the doctor's car.",
                "The doctor was youngish and professionally breezy. He came in as though it\n      were sunny noontime. \"Well, George, little trouble, eh? How is she now?\"\n       he said busily as, with tremendous and rather irritating cheerfulness, he\n      tossed his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at a radiator. He took\n      charge of the house. Babbitt felt ousted and unimportant as he followed\n      the doctor up to the bedroom, and it was the doctor who chuckled, \"Oh,\n      just little stomach-ache\" when Verona peeped through her door, begging,\n      \"What is it, Dad, what is it?\"",
                "To Mrs. Babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence, after his\n      examination, \"Kind of a bad old pain, eh? I'll give you something to make\n      you sleep, and I think you'll feel better in the morning. I'll come in\n      right after breakfast.\" But to Babbitt, lying in wait in the lower hall,\n      the doctor sighed, \"I don't like the feeling there in her belly. There's\n      some rigidity and some inflammation. She's never had her appendix out has\n      she? Um. Well, no use worrying. I'll be here first thing in the morning,\n      and meantime she'll get some rest. I've given her a hypo. Good night.\"",
                "Then was Babbitt caught up in the black tempest.",
                "Instantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the\n      spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd\n      before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and\n      traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and\n      the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her.\n      As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on the edge\n      of her bed, holding her hand, and for the first time in many weeks her\n      hand abode trustfully in his.",
                "He draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and\n      white couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair. The bedroom was\n      uncanny in its half-light, which turned the curtains to lurking robbers,\n      the dressing-table to a turreted castle. It smelled of cosmetics, of\n      linen, of sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times. He\n      heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some\n      officious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite form\n      the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was infinite. When\n      dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell asleep, and was vexed\n      to have been caught off his guard, to have been aroused by Verona's\n      entrance and her agitated \"Oh, what is it, Dad?\"",
                "His wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light, but\n      now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman, to be\n      contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might\n      criticize her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag\n      himself, interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of\n      changing -- or any real desire to change -- the eternal essence.",
                "With Verona he sounded fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who\n      satisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing. He ordered\n      early breakfast, and wanted to look at the newspaper, and felt somehow\n      heroic and useful in not looking at it. But there were still crawling and\n      totally unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.",
                "\"Don't see much change,\" said Patten. \"I'll be back about eleven, and if\n      you don't mind, I think I'll bring in some other world-famous pill-pedler\n      for consultation, just to be on the safe side. Now George, there's nothing\n      you can do. I'll have Verona keep the ice-bag filled -- might as well\n      leave that on, I guess -- and you, you better beat it to the office\n      instead of standing around her looking as if you were the patient. The\n      nerve of husbands! Lot more neurotic than the women! They always have to\n      horn in and get all the credit for feeling bad when their wives are\n      ailing. Now have another nice cup of coffee and git!\"",
                "Under this derision Babbitt became more matter-of-fact. He drove to the\n      office, tried to dictate letters, tried to telephone and, before the call\n      was answered, forgot to whom he was telephoning. At a quarter after ten he\n      returned home. As he left the down-town traffic and sped up the car, his\n      face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.",
                "His wife greeted him with surprise. \"Why did you come back, dear? I think\n      I feel a little better. I told Verona to skip off to her office. Was it\n      wicked of me to go and get sick?\"",
                "He knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. They were\n      curiously happy when he heard Dr. Patten's car in front. He looked out of\n      the window. He was frightened. With Patten was an impatient man with\n      turbulent black hair and a hussar mustache -- Dr. A. I. Dilling, the\n      surgeon. Babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and hurried\n      down to the door.",
                "Dr. Patten was profusely casual: \"Don't want to worry you, old man, but I\n      thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.\" He\n      gestured toward Dilling as toward a master.",
                "Dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt tramped\n      the living-room in agony. Except for his wife's confinements there had\n      never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery was at once\n      a miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and Patten came\n      down again he knew that everything was all right, and he wanted to laugh,\n      for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded physicians in a musical\n      comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and looking foolishly sagacious.",
                "Dr. Dilling spoke:",
                "\"I'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. We ought to operate. Of\n      course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be\n      done.\"",
                "Babbitt did not get all the force of it. He mumbled, \"Well I suppose we\n      could get her ready in a couple o' days. Probably Ted ought to come down\n      from the university, just in case anything happened.\"",
                "Dr. Dilling growled, \"Nope. If you don't want peritonitis to set in, we'll\n      have to operate right away. I must advise it strongly. If you say go\n      ahead, I'll 'phone for the St. Mary's ambulance at once, and we'll have\n      her on the table in three-quarters of an hour.\"",
                "\"I -- I Of course, I suppose you know what -- But great God, man, I\n      can't get her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! And\n      in her state, so wrought-up and weak -- \"",
                "\"Just throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that's all\n      she'll need for a day or two,\" said Dr. Dilling, and went to the\n      telephone.",
                "Babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He sent the frightened Tinka out\n      of the room. He said gaily to his wife, \"Well, old thing, the doc thinks\n      maybe we better have a little operation and get it over. Just take a few\n      minutes -- not half as serious as a confinement -- and you'll be all\n      right in a jiffy.\"",
                "She gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a\n      cowed child, \"I'm afraid -- to go into the dark, all alone!\" Maturity\n      was wiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. \"Will you stay\n      with me? Darling, you don't have to go to the office now, do you? Could\n      you just go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this\n      evening -- if everything's all right? You won't have to go out this\n      evening, will you?\"",
                "He was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he\n      sobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, \"Old honey, I love\n      you more than anything in the world! I've kind of been worried by business\n      and everything, but that's all over now, and I'm back again.\"",
                "\"Are you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a\n      good thing if I just WENT. I was wondering if anybody really needed me. Or\n      wanted me. I was wondering what was the use of my living. I've been\n      getting so stupid and ugly -- \"",
                "\"Why, you old humbug! Fishing for compliments when I ought to be packing\n      your bag! Me, sure, I'm young and handsome and a regular village cut-up\n      and -- \" He could not go on. He sobbed again; and in muttered\n      incoherencies they found each other.",
                "As he packed, his brain was curiously clear and swift. He'd have no more\n      wild evenings, he realized. He admitted that he would regret them. A\n      little grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling\n      before the paralyzed contentment of middle-age. Well, and he grinned\n      impishly, \"it was one doggone good party while it lasted!\" And -- how\n      much was the operation going to cost? \"I ought to have fought that out\n      with Dilling. But no, damn it, I don't care how much it costs!\"",
                "The motor ambulance was at the door. Even in his grief the Babbitt who\n      admired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill with\n      which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried her\n      down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white thing. Mrs.\n      Babbitt moaned, \"It frightens me. It's just like a hearse, just like being\n      put in a hearse. I want you to stay with me.\"",
                "\"I'll be right up front with the driver,\" Babbitt promised.",
                "\"No, I want you to stay inside with me.\" To the attendants: \"Can't he be\n      inside?\"",
                "\"Sure, ma'am, you bet. There's a fine little camp-stool in there,\" the\n      older attendant said, with professional pride.",
                "He sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its\n      active little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar,\n      displaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising grocer.\n      But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched the\n      radiator, and he squealed:",
                "\"Ouch! Jesus!\"",
                "\"Why, George Babbitt, I won't have you cursing and swearing and\n      blaspheming!\"",
                "\"I know, awful sorry but -- Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my\n      hand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn\n      radiator is hot as -- it's hot as -- it's hotter 'n the hinges of\n      Hades! Look! You can see the mark!\"",
                "So, as they drove up to St. Mary's Hospital, with the nurses already\n      laying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was she\n      who consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though he tried\n      to be gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be babied.",
                "The ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the hospital,\n      and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare succession of\n      cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women sitting up in bed, an\n      elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne contemptuous of\n      husbands. He was permitted to kiss his wife; he saw a thin dark nurse fit\n      the cone over her mouth and nose; he stiffened at a sweet and treacherous\n      odor; then he was driven out, and on a high stool in a laboratory he sat\n      dazed, longing to see her once again, to insist that he had always loved\n      her, had never for a second loved anybody else or looked at anybody else.\n      In the laboratory he was conscious only of a decayed object preserved in a\n      bottle of yellowing alcohol. It made him very sick, but he could not take\n      his eyes from it. He was more aware of it than of waiting. His mind\n      floated in abeyance, coming back always to that horrible bottle. To escape\n      it he opened the door to the right, hoping to find a sane and\n      business-like office. He realized that he was looking into the\n      operating-room; in one glance he took in Dr. Dilling, strange in white\n      gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table with its screws and\n      wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton sponges, and a swathed\n      thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white in the midst of which was\n      a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little bloody at the edges,\n      protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like clinging parasites.",
                "He shut the door with haste. It may be that his frightened repentance of\n      the night and morning had not eaten in, but this dehumanizing interment of\n      her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly, and as he\n      crouched again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his\n      wife . . . to Zenith . . . to business efficiency . . . to the Boosters'\n      Club . . . to every faith of the Clan of Good Fellows.",
                "Then a nurse was soothing, \"All over! Perfect success! She'll come out\n      fine! She'll be out from under the anesthetic soon, and you can see her.\"",
                "He found her on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but\n      her purple lips moving slightly. Then only did he really believe that she\n      was alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, \"Hard get\n      real maple syrup for pancakes.\" He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed on the\n      nurse and proudly confided, \"Think of her talking about maple syrup! By\n      golly, I'm going to go and order a hundred gallons of it, right from\n      Vermont!\"",
                "II",
                "She was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to see her each\n      afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. Once he\n      hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch, and she was\n      inflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor George.",
                "If once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good\n      Fellows, he was convinced now. You didn't, he noted, \"see Seneca Doane\n      coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus,\"\n       but Mrs. Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine\n      jelly (flavored with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking out\n      the kind of novels Mrs. Babbitt liked -- nice love stories about New\n      York millionaries and Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a pink\n      bed-jacket; Sidney Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of a wife\n      selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and Stein.",
                "All his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. At the\n      Athletic Club they asked after her daily. Club members whose names he did\n      not know stopped him to inquire, \"How's your good lady getting on?\"\n       Babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich\n      warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.",
                "One noon Vergil Gunch suggested, \"You planning to be at the hospital about\n      six? The wife and I thought we'd drop in.\" They did drop in. Gunch was so\n      humorous that Mrs. Babbitt said he must \"stop making her laugh because\n      honestly it was hurting her incision.\" As they passed down the hall Gunch\n      demanded amiably, \"George, old scout, you were soreheaded about something,\n      here a while back. I don't know why, and it's none of my business. But you\n      seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why don't you come join us in\n      the Good Citizens' League, old man? We have some corking times together,\n      and we need your advice.\"",
                "Then did Babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of\n      bullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert\n      without injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic\n      revolutionist. He patted Gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a member\n      of the Good Citizens' League.",
                "Within two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the\n      wickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of\n      immigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than\n      was George F. Babbitt."

                "THE Good Citizens' League had spread through the country, but nowhere was\n      it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of Zenith,\n      commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most of which -- though\n      not all -- lay inland, against a background of cornfields and mines and\n      of small towns which depended upon them for mortgage-loans, table-manners,\n      art, social philosophy and millinery.",
                "To the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They\n      were not all of the kind who called themselves \"Regular Guys.\" Besides\n      these hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the\n      aristocrats, that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more\n      generations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners,\n      the corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old\n      men who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith, collected\n      luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in Paris. All of\n      them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their place; and all\n      of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply any equality of\n      wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought, dress, painting,\n      morals, and vocabulary.",
                "In this they were like the ruling-class of any other country, particularly\n      of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually\n      trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes, everywhere,\n      desire, but usually despair of realizing.",
                "The longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the Open\n      Shop -- which was secretly a struggle against all union labor.\n      Accompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in\n      English and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers,\n      so that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one\n      hundred per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for workmen\n      to trust and love their employers.",
                "The League was more than generous in approving other organizations which\n      agreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M. C.A. to raise a\n      two-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil\n      Gunch, Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators\n      at movie theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the \"good\n      old Y.\" had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty Colonel\n      Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times, was photographed clasping\n      the hand of Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true that afterward, when\n      Smeeth lisped, \"You must come to one of our prayer-meetings,\" the\n      ferocious Colonel bellowed, \"What the hell would I do that for? I've got a\n      bar of my own,\" but this did not appear in the public prints.",
                "The League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of\n      the lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of\n      veterans of the Great War. One evening a number of young men raided the\n      Zenith Socialist Headquarters, burned its records, beat the office staff,\n      and agreeably dumped desks out of the window. All of the newspapers save\n      the Advocate-Times and the Evening Advocate attributed this valuable but\n      perhaps hasty direct-action to the American Legion. Then a flying squadron\n      from the Good Citizens' League called on the unfair papers and explained\n      that no ex-soldier could possibly do such a thing, and the editors saw the\n      light, and retained their advertising. When Zenith's lone Conscientious\n      Objector came home from prison and was righteously run out of town, the\n      newspapers referred to the perpetrators as an \"unidentified mob.\"",
                "II",
                "In all the activities and triumphs of the Good Citizens' League Babbitt\n      took part, and completely won back to self-respect, placidity, and the\n      affection of his friends. But he began to protest, \"Gosh, I've done my\n      share in cleaning up the city. I want to tend to business. Think I'll just\n      kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now.\"",
                "He had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters' Club. He\n      had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him. He was\n      worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his salvation. He\n      was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but Dr. John\n      Jennison Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take a chance.",
                "One evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew's parsonage he impulsively\n      went in and found the pastor in his study.",
                "\"Jus' minute -- getting 'phone call,\" said Dr. Drew in businesslike\n      tones, then, aggressively, to the telephone: \"'Lo -- 'lo! This Berkey\n      and Hannis? Reverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for\n      next Sunday's calendar? Huh? Y' ought to have it here. Well, I can't help\n      it if they're ALL sick! I got to have it to-night. Get an A.D.T. boy and\n      shoot it up here quick.\"",
                "He turned, without slackening his briskness. \"Well, Brother Babbitt, what\n      c'n I do for you?\"",
                "\"I just wanted to ask -- Tell you how it is, dominie: Here a while ago\n      I guess I got kind of slack. Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted to\n      ask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his\n      senses? Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him in\n      the long run?\"",
