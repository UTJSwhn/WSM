                "CHAPTER I",
                "I",
                "ON a hill by the Mississippi where Chippewas camped two generations ago, a\n      girl stood in relief against the cornflower blue of Northern sky. She saw\n      no Indians now; she saw flour-mills and the blinking windows of\n      skyscrapers in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Nor was she thinking of squaws\n      and portages, and the Yankee fur-traders whose shadows were all about her.\n      She was meditating upon walnut fudge, the plays of Brieux, the reasons why\n      heels run over, and the fact that the chemistry instructor had stared at\n      the new coiffure which concealed her ears.",
                "A breeze which had crossed a thousand miles of wheat-lands bellied her\n      taffeta skirt in a line so graceful, so full of animation and moving\n      beauty, that the heart of a chance watcher on the lower road tightened to\n      wistfulness over her quality of suspended freedom. She lifted her arms,\n      she leaned back against the wind, her skirt dipped and flared, a lock blew\n      wild. A girl on a hilltop; credulous, plastic, young; drinking the air as\n      she longed to drink life. The eternal aching comedy of expectant youth.",
                "It is Carol Milford, fleeing for an hour from Blodgett College.",
                "The days of pioneering, of lassies in sunbonnets, and bears killed with\n      axes in piney clearings, are deader now than Camelot; and a rebellious\n      girl is the spirit of that bewildered empire called the American\n      Middlewest.",
                "II",
                "Blodgett College is on the edge of Minneapolis. It is a bulwark of sound\n      religion. It is still combating the recent heresies of Voltaire, Darwin,\n      and Robert Ingersoll. Pious families in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the\n      Dakotas send their children thither, and Blodgett protects them from the\n      wickedness of the universities. But it secretes friendly girls, young men\n      who sing, and one lady instructress who really likes Milton and Carlyle.\n      So the four years which Carol spent at Blodgett were not altogether\n      wasted. The smallness of the school, the fewness of rivals, permitted her\n      to experiment with her perilous versatility. She played tennis, gave\n      chafing-dish parties, took a graduate seminar in the drama, went\n      \"twosing,\" and joined half a dozen societies for the practise of the arts\n      or the tense stalking of a thing called General Culture.",
                "In her class there were two or three prettier girls, but none more eager.\n      She was noticeable equally in the classroom grind and at dances, though\n      out of the three hundred students of Blodgett, scores recited more\n      accurately and dozens Bostoned more smoothly. Every cell of her body was\n      alive -- thin wrists, quince-blossom skin, ingenue eyes, black hair.",
                "The other girls in her dormitory marveled at the slightness of her body\n      when they saw her in sheer negligee, or darting out wet from a\n      shower-bath. She seemed then but half as large as they had supposed; a\n      fragile child who must be cloaked with understanding kindness. \"Psychic,\"\n       the girls whispered, and \"spiritual.\" Yet so radioactive were her nerves,\n      so adventurous her trust in rather vaguely conceived sweetness and light,\n      that she was more energetic than any of the hulking young women who, with\n      calves bulging in heavy-ribbed woolen stockings beneath decorous blue\n      serge bloomers, thuddingly galloped across the floor of the \"gym\" in\n      practise for the Blodgett Ladies' Basket-Ball Team.",
                "Even when she was tired her dark eyes were observant. She did not yet know\n      the immense ability of the world to be casually cruel and proudly dull,\n      but if she should ever learn those dismaying powers, her eyes would never\n      become sullen or heavy or rheumily amorous.",
                "For all her enthusiasms, for all the fondness and the \"crushes\" which she\n      inspired, Carol's acquaintances were shy of her. When she was most\n      ardently singing hymns or planning deviltry she yet seemed gently aloof\n      and critical. She was credulous, perhaps; a born hero-worshipper; yet she\n      did question and examine unceasingly. Whatever she might become she would\n      never be static.",
                "Her versatility ensnared her. By turns she hoped to discover that she had\n      an unusual voice, a talent for the piano, the ability to act, to write, to\n      manage organizations. Always she was disappointed, but always she\n      effervesced anew -- over the Student Volunteers, who intended to become\n      missionaries, over painting scenery for the dramatic club, over soliciting\n      advertisements for the college magazine.",
                "She was on the peak that Sunday afternoon when she played in chapel. Out\n      of the dusk her violin took up the organ theme, and the candle-light\n      revealed her in a straight golden frock, her arm arched to the bow, her\n      lips serious. Every man fell in love then with religion and Carol.",
                "Throughout Senior year she anxiously related all her experiments and\n      partial successes to a career. Daily, on the library steps or in the hall\n      of the Main Building, the co-eds talked of \"What shall we do when we\n      finish college?\" Even the girls who knew that they were going to be\n      married pretended to be considering important business positions; even\n      they who knew that they would have to work hinted about fabulous suitors.\n      As for Carol, she was an orphan; her only near relative was a\n      vanilla-flavored sister married to an optician in St. Paul. She had used\n      most of the money from her father's estate. She was not in love -- that\n      is, not often, nor ever long at a time. She would earn her living.",
                "But how she was to earn it, how she was to conquer the world -- almost\n      entirely for the world's own good -- she did not see. Most of the girls\n      who were not betrothed meant to be teachers. Of these there were two\n      sorts: careless young women who admitted that they intended to leave the\n      \"beastly classroom and grubby children\" the minute they had a chance to\n      marry; and studious, sometimes bulbous-browed and pop-eyed maidens who at\n      class prayer-meetings requested God to \"guide their feet along the paths\n      of greatest usefulness.\" Neither sort tempted Carol. The former seemed\n      insincere (a favorite word of hers at this era). The earnest virgins were,\n      she fancied, as likely to do harm as to do good by their faith in the\n      value of parsing Caesar.",
                "At various times during Senior year Carol finally decided upon studying\n      law, writing motion-picture scenarios, professional nursing, and marrying\n      an unidentified hero.",
                "Then she found a hobby in sociology.",
                "The sociology instructor was new. He was married, and therefore taboo, but\n      he had come from Boston, he had lived among poets and socialists and Jews\n      and millionaire uplifters at the University Settlement in New York, and he\n      had a beautiful white strong neck. He led a giggling class through the\n      prisons, the charity bureaus, the employment agencies of Minneapolis and\n      St. Paul. Trailing at the end of the line Carol was indignant at the\n      prodding curiosity of the others, their manner of staring at the poor as\n      at a Zoo. She felt herself a great liberator. She put her hand to her\n      mouth, her forefinger and thumb quite painfully pinching her lower lip,\n      and frowned, and enjoyed being aloof.",
                "A classmate named Stewart Snyder, a competent bulky young man in a gray\n      flannel shirt, a rusty black bow tie, and the green-and-purple class cap,\n      grumbled to her as they walked behind the others in the muck of the South\n      St. Paul stockyards, \"These college chumps make me tired. They're so\n      top-lofty. They ought to of worked on the farm, the way I have. These\n      workmen put it all over them.\"",
                "\"I just love common workmen,\" glowed Carol.",
                "\"Only you don't want to forget that common workmen don't think they're\n      common!\"",
                "\"You're right! I apologize!\" Carol's brows lifted in the astonishment of\n      emotion, in a glory of abasement. Her eyes mothered the world. Stewart\n      Snyder peered at her. He rammed his large red fists into his pockets, he\n      jerked them out, he resolutely got rid of them by clenching his hands\n      behind him, and he stammered:",
                "\"I know. You get people. Most of these darn co-eds --  -- Say,\n      Carol, you could do a lot for people.\"",
                "\"Oh -- oh well -- you know -- sympathy and everything -- if\n      you were -- say you were a lawyer's wife. You'd understand his clients.\n      I'm going to be a lawyer. I admit I fall down in sympathy sometimes. I get\n      so dog-gone impatient with people that can't stand the gaff. You'd be good\n      for a fellow that was too serious. Make him more -- more -- YOU know -- sympathetic!\"",
                "His slightly pouting lips, his mastiff eyes, were begging her to beg him\n      to go on. She fled from the steam-roller of his sentiment. She cried, \"Oh,\n      see those poor sheep -- millions and millions of them.\" She darted on.",
                "Stewart was not interesting. He hadn't a shapely white neck, and he had\n      never lived among celebrated reformers. She wanted, just now, to have a\n      cell in a settlement-house, like a nun without the bother of a black robe,\n      and be kind, and read Bernard Shaw, and enormously improve a horde of\n      grateful poor.",
                "The supplementary reading in sociology led her to a book on\n      village-improvement -- tree-planting, town pageants, girls' clubs. It\n      had pictures of greens and garden-walls in France, New England,\n      Pennsylvania. She had picked it up carelessly, with a slight yawn which\n      she patted down with her finger-tips as delicately as a cat.",
                "She dipped into the book, lounging on her window-seat, with her slim,\n      lisle-stockinged legs crossed, and her knees up under her chin. She\n      stroked a satin pillow while she read. About her was the clothy exuberance\n      of a Blodgett College room: cretonne-covered window-seat, photographs of\n      girls, a carbon print of the Coliseum, a chafing-dish, and a dozen pillows\n      embroidered or beaded or pyrographed. Shockingly out of place was a\n      miniature of the Dancing Bacchante. It was the only trace of Carol in the\n      room. She had inherited the rest from generations of girl students.",
                "It was as a part of all this commonplaceness that she regarded the\n      treatise on village-improvement. But she suddenly stopped fidgeting. She\n      strode into the book. She had fled half-way through it before the three\n      o'clock bell called her to the class in English history.",
                "She sighed, \"That's what I'll do after college! I'll get my hands on one\n      of these prairie towns and make it beautiful. Be an inspiration. I suppose\n      I'd better become a teacher then, but -- I won't be that kind of a\n      teacher. I won't drone. Why should they have all the garden suburbs on\n      Long Island? Nobody has done anything with the ugly towns here in the\n      Northwest except hold revivals and build libraries to contain the Elsie\n      books. I'll make 'em put in a village green, and darling cottages, and a\n      quaint Main Street!\"",
                "Thus she triumphed through the class, which was a typical Blodgett contest\n      between a dreary teacher and unwilling children of twenty, won by the\n      teacher because his opponents had to answer his questions, while their\n      treacherous queries he could counter by demanding, \"Have you looked that\n      up in the library? Well then, suppose you do!\"",
                "The history instructor was a retired minister. He was sarcastic today. He\n      begged of sporting young Mr. Charley Holmberg, \"Now Charles, would it\n      interrupt your undoubtedly fascinating pursuit of that malevolent fly if I\n      were to ask you to tell us that you do not know anything about King John?\"\n       He spent three delightful minutes in assuring himself of the fact that no\n      one exactly remembered the date of Magna Charta.",
                "Carol did not hear him. She was completing the roof of a half-timbered\n      town hall. She had found one man in the prairie village who did not\n      appreciate her picture of winding streets and arcades, but she had\n      assembled the town council and dramatically defeated him.",
                "III",
                "Though she was Minnesota-born Carol was not an intimate of the prairie\n      villages. Her father, the smiling and shabby, the learned and teasingly\n      kind, had come from Massachusetts, and through all her childhood he had\n      been a judge in Mankato, which is not a prairie town, but in its\n      garden-sheltered streets and aisles of elms is white and green New England\n      reborn. Mankato lies between cliffs and the Minnesota River, hard by\n      Traverse des Sioux, where the first settlers made treaties with the\n      Indians, and the cattle-rustlers once came galloping before\n      hell-for-leather posses.",
                "As she climbed along the banks of the dark river Carol listened to its\n      fables about the wide land of yellow waters and bleached buffalo bones to\n      the West; the Southern levees and singing darkies and palm trees toward\n      which it was forever mysteriously gliding; and she heard again the\n      startled bells and thick puffing of high-stacked river steamers wrecked on\n      sand-reefs sixty years ago. Along the decks she saw missionaries, gamblers\n      in tall pot hats, and Dakota chiefs with scarlet blankets. . . . Far off\n      whistles at night, round the river bend, plunking paddles reechoed by the\n      pines, and a glow on black sliding waters.",
                "Carol's family were self-sufficient in their inventive life, with\n      Christmas a rite full of surprises and tenderness, and \"dressing-up\n      parties\" spontaneous and joyously absurd. The beasts in the Milford\n      hearth-mythology were not the obscene Night Animals who jump out of\n      closets and eat little girls, but beneficent and bright-eyed creatures -- the\n      tam htab, who is woolly and blue and lives in the bathroom, and runs\n      rapidly to warm small feet; the ferruginous oil stove, who purrs and knows\n      stories; and the skitamarigg, who will play with children before breakfast\n      if they spring out of bed and close the window at the very first line of\n      the song about puellas which father sings while shaving.",
                "Judge Milford's pedagogical scheme was to let the children read whatever\n      they pleased, and in his brown library Carol absorbed Balzac and Rabelais\n      and Thoreau and Max Muller. He gravely taught them the letters on the\n      backs of the encyclopedias, and when polite visitors asked about the\n      mental progress of the \"little ones,\" they were horrified to hear the\n      children earnestly repeating A-And, And-Aus, Aus-Bis, Bis-Cal, Cal-Cha.",
                "Carol's mother died when she was nine. Her father retired from the\n      judiciary when she was eleven, and took the family to Minneapolis. There\n      he died, two years after. Her sister, a busy proper advisory soul, older\n      than herself, had become a stranger to her even when they lived in the\n      same house.",
                "From those early brown and silver days and from her independence of\n      relatives Carol retained a willingness to be different from brisk\n      efficient book-ignoring people; an instinct to observe and wonder at their\n      bustle even when she was taking part in it. But, she felt approvingly, as\n      she discovered her career of town-planning, she was now roused to being\n      brisk and efficient herself.",
                "IV",
                "In a month Carol's ambition had clouded. Her hesitancy about becoming a\n      teacher had returned. She was not, she worried, strong enough to endure\n      the routine, and she could not picture herself standing before grinning\n      children and pretending to be wise and decisive. But the desire for the\n      creation of a beautiful town remained. When she encountered an item about\n      small-town women's clubs or a photograph of a straggling Main Street, she\n      was homesick for it, she felt robbed of her work.",
                "It was the advice of the professor of English which led her to study\n      professional library-work in a Chicago school. Her imagination carved and\n      colored the new plan. She saw herself persuading children to read charming\n      fairy tales, helping young men to find books on mechanics, being ever so\n      courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapers -- the light of\n      the library, an authority on books, invited to dinners with poets and\n      explorers, reading a paper to an association of distinguished scholars.",
                "V",
                "The last faculty reception before commencement. In five days they would be\n      in the cyclone of final examinations.",
                "The house of the president had been massed with palms suggestive of polite\n      undertaking parlors, and in the library, a ten-foot room with a globe and\n      the portraits of Whittier and Martha Washington, the student orchestra was\n      playing \"Carmen\" and \"Madame Butterfly.\" Carol was dizzy with music and\n      the emotions of parting. She saw the palms as a jungle, the pink-shaded\n      electric globes as an opaline haze, and the eye-glassed faculty as\n      Olympians. She was melancholy at sight of the mousey girls with whom she\n      had \"always intended to get acquainted,\" and the half dozen young men who\n      were ready to fall in love with her.",
                "But it was Stewart Snyder whom she encouraged. He was so much manlier than\n      the others; he was an even warm brown, like his new ready-made suit with\n      its padded shoulders. She sat with him, and with two cups of coffee and a\n      chicken patty, upon a pile of presidential overshoes in the coat-closet\n      under the stairs, and as the thin music seeped in, Stewart whispered:",
                "\"I can't stand it, this breaking up after four years! The happiest years\n      of life.\"",
                "She believed it. \"Oh, I know! To think that in just a few days we'll be\n      parting, and we'll never see some of the bunch again!\"",
                "\"Carol, you got to listen to me! You always duck when I try to talk\n      seriously to you, but you got to listen to me. I'm going to be a big\n      lawyer, maybe a judge, and I need you, and I'd protect you --  -- \"",
                "His arm slid behind her shoulders. The insinuating music drained her\n      independence. She said mournfully, \"Would you take care of me?\" She\n      touched his hand. It was warm, solid.",
                "\"You bet I would! We'd have, Lord, we'd have bully times in Yankton, where\n      I'm going to settle --  -- \"",
                "\"But I want to do something with life.\"",
                "\"What's better than making a comfy home and bringing up some cute kids and\n      knowing nice homey people?\"",
                "It was the immemorial male reply to the restless woman. Thus to the young\n      Sappho spake the melon-venders; thus the captains to Zenobia; and in the\n      damp cave over gnawed bones the hairy suitor thus protested to the woman\n      advocate of matriarchy. In the dialect of Blodgett College but with the\n      voice of Sappho was Carol's answer:",
                "\"Of course. I know. I suppose that's so. Honestly, I do love children. But\n      there's lots of women that can do housework, but I -- well, if you HAVE\n      got a college education, you ought to use it for the world.\"",
                "\"I know, but you can use it just as well in the home. And gee, Carol, just\n      think of a bunch of us going out on an auto picnic, some nice spring\n      evening.\"",
                "\"Yes.\"",
                "\"And sleigh-riding in winter, and going fishing --  -- \"",
                "Blarrrrrrr! The orchestra had crashed into the \"Soldiers' Chorus\"; and she\n      was protesting, \"No! No! You're a dear, but I want to do things. I don't\n      understand myself but I want -- everything in the world! Maybe I can't\n      sing or write, but I know I can be an influence in library work. Just\n      suppose I encouraged some boy and he became a great artist! I will! I will\n      do it! Stewart dear, I can't settle down to nothing but dish-washing!\"",
                "Two minutes later -- two hectic minutes -- they were disturbed by an\n      embarrassed couple also seeking the idyllic seclusion of the\n      overshoe-closet.",
                "After graduation she never saw Stewart Snyder again. She wrote to him once\n      a week -- for one month.",
                "VI",
                "A year Carol spent in Chicago. Her study of library-cataloguing,\n      recording, books of reference, was easy and not too somniferous. She\n      reveled in the Art Institute, in symphonies and violin recitals and\n      chamber music, in the theater and classic dancing. She almost gave up\n      library work to become one of the young women who dance in cheese-cloth in\n      the moonlight. She was taken to a certified Studio Party, with beer,\n      cigarettes, bobbed hair, and a Russian Jewess who sang the Internationale.\n      It cannot be reported that Carol had anything significant to say to the\n      Bohemians. She was awkward with them, and felt ignorant, and she was\n      shocked by the free manners which she had for years desired. But she heard\n      and remembered discussions of Freud, Romain Rolland, syndicalism, the\n      Confederation Generale du Travail, feminism vs. haremism, Chinese lyrics,\n      nationalization of mines, Christian Science, and fishing in Ontario.",
                "She went home, and that was the beginning and end of her Bohemian life.",
                "The second cousin of Carol's sister's husband lived in Winnetka, and once\n      invited her out to Sunday dinner. She walked back through Wilmette and\n      Evanston, discovered new forms of suburban architecture, and remembered\n      her desire to recreate villages. She decided that she would give up\n      library work and, by a miracle whose nature was not very clearly revealed\n      to her, turn a prairie town into Georgian houses and Japanese bungalows.",
                "The next day in library class she had to read a theme on the use of the\n      Cumulative Index, and she was taken so seriously in the discussion that\n      she put off her career of town-planning -- and in the autumn she was in\n      the public library of St. Paul.",
                "VII",
                "Carol was not unhappy and she was not exhilarated, in the St. Paul\n      Library. She slowly confessed that she was not visibly affecting lives.\n      She did, at first, put into her contact with the patrons a willingness\n      which should have moved worlds. But so few of these stolid worlds wanted\n      to be moved. When she was in charge of the magazine room the readers did\n      not ask for suggestions about elevated essays. They grunted, \"Wanta find\n      the Leather Goods Gazette for last February.\" When she was giving out\n      books the principal query was, \"Can you tell me of a good, light, exciting\n      love story to read? My husband's going away for a week.\"",
                "She was fond of the other librarians; proud of their aspirations. And by\n      the chance of propinquity she read scores of books unnatural to her gay\n      white littleness: volumes of anthropology with ditches of foot-notes\n      filled with heaps of small dusty type, Parisian imagistes, Hindu recipes\n      for curry, voyages to the Solomon Isles, theosophy with modern American\n      improvements, treatises upon success in the real-estate business. She took\n      walks, and was sensible about shoes and diet. And never did she feel that\n      she was living.",
                "She went to dances and suppers at the houses of college acquaintances.\n      Sometimes she one-stepped demurely; sometimes, in dread of life's slipping\n      past, she turned into a bacchanal, her tender eyes excited, her throat\n      tense, as she slid down the room.",
                "During her three years of library work several men showed diligent\n      interest in her -- the treasurer of a fur-manufacturing firm, a\n      teacher, a newspaper reporter, and a petty railroad official. None of them\n      made her more than pause in thought. For months no male emerged from the\n      mass. Then, at the Marburys', she met Dr. Will Kennicott."

                "IT was a frail and blue and lonely Carol who trotted to the flat of the\n      Johnson Marburys for Sunday evening supper. Mrs. Marbury was a neighbor\n      and friend of Carol's sister; Mr. Marbury a traveling representative of an\n      insurance company. They made a specialty of sandwich-salad-coffee lap\n      suppers, and they regarded Carol as their literary and artistic\n      representative. She was the one who could be depended upon to appreciate\n      the Caruso phonograph record, and the Chinese lantern which Mr. Marbury\n      had brought back as his present from San Francisco. Carol found the\n      Marburys admiring and therefore admirable.",
                "This September Sunday evening she wore a net frock with a pale pink\n      lining. A nap had soothed away the faint lines of tiredness beside her\n      eyes. She was young, naive, stimulated by the coolness. She flung her coat\n      at the chair in the hall of the flat, and exploded into the green-plush\n      living-room. The familiar group were trying to be conversational. She saw\n      Mr. Marbury, a woman teacher of gymnastics in a high school, a chief clerk\n      from the Great Northern Railway offices, a young lawyer. But there was\n      also a stranger, a thick tall man of thirty-six or -seven, with stolid\n      brown hair, lips used to giving orders, eyes which followed everything\n      good-naturedly, and clothes which you could never quite remember.",
                "Mr. Marbury boomed, \"Carol, come over here and meet Doc Kennicott -- Dr.\n      Will Kennicott of Gopher Prairie. He does all our insurance-examining up\n      in that neck of the woods, and they do say he's some doctor!\"",
                "As she edged toward the stranger and murmured nothing in particular, Carol\n      remembered that Gopher Prairie was a Minnesota wheat-prairie town of\n      something over three thousand people.",
                "\"Pleased to meet you,\" stated Dr. Kennicott. His hand was strong; the palm\n      soft, but the back weathered, showing golden hairs against firm red skin.",
                "He looked at her as though she was an agreeable discovery. She tugged her\n      hand free and fluttered, \"I must go out to the kitchen and help Mrs.\n      Marbury.\" She did not speak to him again till, after she had heated the\n      rolls and passed the paper napkins, Mr. Marbury captured her with a loud,\n      \"Oh, quit fussing now. Come over here and sit down and tell us how's\n      tricks.\" He herded her to a sofa with Dr. Kennicott, who was rather vague\n      about the eyes, rather drooping of bulky shoulder, as though he was\n      wondering what he was expected to do next. As their host left them,\n      Kennicott awoke:",
                "\"Marbury tells me you're a high mogul in the public library. I was\n      surprised. Didn't hardly think you were old enough. I thought you were a\n      girl, still in college maybe.\"",

I feel I've got something to say about\n      running Gopher Prairie, but you take it in a big city of two-three hundred\n      thousand, and I'm just one flea on the dog's back. And then I like country\n      driving, and the hunting in the fall. Do you know Gopher Prairie at all?\"",

Say honestly --  -- Of course I may be prejudiced, but I've\n      seen an awful lot of towns -- one time I went to Atlantic City for the\n      American Medical Association meeting, and I spent practically a week in\n      New York! But I never saw a town that had such up-and-coming people as\n      Gopher Prairie. Bresnahan -- you know -- the famous auto\n      manufacturer -- he comes from Gopher Prairie. Born and brought up\n      there! And it's a darn pretty town. Lots of fine maples and box-elders,\n      and there's two of the dandiest lakes you ever saw, right near town! And\n      we've got seven miles of cement walks already, and building more every\n      day! Course a lot of these towns still put up with plank walks, but not\n      for us, you bet!\"",

                "\"Yes, that's so, but I guess most of us get rusty. We land in a rut of\n      obstetrics and typhoid and busted legs. What we need is women like you to\n      jump on us. It'd be you that would transform the town.\"",
                "\"No, I couldn't. Too flighty. I did used to think about doing just that,\n      curiously enough, but I seem to have drifted away from the idea. Oh, I'm a\n      fine one to be lecturing you!\"",

                "Of the love-making of Carol and Will Kennicott there is nothing to be told\n      which may not be heard on every summer evening, on every shadowy block.",
                "They were biology and mystery; their speech was slang phrases and flares\n      of poetry; their silences were contentment, or shaky crises when his arm\n      took her shoulder. All the beauty of youth, first discovered when it is\n      passing -- and all the commonplaceness of a well-to-do unmarried man\n      encountering a pretty girl at the time when she is slightly weary of her\n      employment and sees no glory ahead nor any man she is glad to serve.",
                "They liked each other honestly -- they were both honest. She was\n      disappointed by his devotion to making money, but she was sure that he did\n      not lie to patients, and that he did keep up with the medical magazines.\n      What aroused her to something more than liking was his boyishness when\n      they went tramping.",
                "They walked from St. Paul down the river to Mendota, Kennicott more\n      elastic-seeming in a cap and a soft crepe shirt, Carol youthful in a\n      tam-o'-shanter of mole velvet, a blue serge suit with an absurdly and\n      agreeably broad turn-down linen collar, and frivolous ankles above\n      athletic shoes. The High Bridge crosses the Mississippi, mounting from low\n      banks to a palisade of cliffs. Far down beneath it on the St. Paul side,\n      upon mud flats, is a wild settlement of chicken-infested gardens and\n      shanties patched together from discarded sign-boards, sheets of corrugated\n      iron, and planks fished out of the river. Carol leaned over the rail of\n      the bridge to look down at this Yang-tse village; in delicious imaginary\n      fear she shrieked that she was dizzy with the height; and it was an\n      extremely human satisfaction to have a strong male snatch her back to\n      safety, instead of having a logical woman teacher or librarian sniff,\n      \"Well, if you're scared, why don't you get away from the rail, then?\"",
                "From the cliffs across the river Carol and Kennicott looked back at St.\n      Paul on its hills; an imperial sweep from the dome of the cathedral to the\n      dome of the state capitol.",
                "The river road led past rocky field slopes, deep glens, woods flamboyant\n      now with September, to Mendota, white walls and a spire among trees\n      beneath a hill, old-world in its placid ease. And for this fresh land, the\n      place is ancient. Here is the bold stone house which General Sibley, the\n      king of fur-traders, built in 1835, with plaster of river mud, and ropes\n      of twisted grass for laths. It has an air of centuries. In its solid rooms\n      Carol and Kennicott found prints from other days which the house had seen -- tail-coats\n      of robin's-egg blue, clumsy Red River carts laden with luxurious furs,\n      whiskered Union soldiers in slant forage caps and rattling sabers.",
                "It suggested to them a common American past, and it was memorable because\n      they had discovered it together. They talked more trustingly, more\n      personally, as they trudged on. They crossed the Minnesota River in a\n      rowboat ferry. They climbed the hill to the round stone tower of Fort\n      Snelling. They saw the junction of the Mississippi and the Minnesota, and\n      recalled the men who had come here eighty years ago -- Maine lumbermen,\n      York traders, soldiers from the Maryland hills.",

                "The hordes of the way-train were not altogether new to Carol. She had seen\n      them on trips from St. Paul to Chicago. But now that they had become her\n      own people, to bathe and encourage and adorn, she had an acute and\n      uncomfortable interest in them. They distressed her. They were so stolid.\n      She had always maintained that there is no American peasantry, and she\n      sought now to defend her faith by seeing imagination and enterprise in the\n      young Swedish farmers, and in a traveling man working over his\n      order-blanks. But the older people, Yankees as well as Norwegians,\n      Germans, Finns, Canucks, had settled into submission to poverty. They were\n      peasants, she groaned.",
                "\"Isn't there any way of waking them up? What would happen if they\n      understood scientific agriculture?\" she begged of Kennicott, her hand\n      groping for his.",
                "It had been a transforming honeymoon. She had been frightened to discover\n      how tumultuous a feeling could be roused in her. Will had been lordly -- stalwart,\n      jolly, impressively competent in making camp, tender and understanding\n      through the hours when they had lain side by side in a tent pitched among\n      pines high up on a lonely mountain spur.",
                "His hand swallowed hers as he started from thoughts of the practise to\n      which he was returning. \"These people? Wake 'em up? What for? They're\n      happy.\"",
                "\"But they're so provincial. No, that isn't what I mean. They're -- oh,\n      so sunk in the mud.\"",
                "\"Look here, Carrie. You want to get over your city idea that because a\n      man's pants aren't pressed, he's a fool. These farmers are mighty keen and\n      up-and-coming.\"",
                "\"I know! That's what hurts. Life seems so hard for them -- these lonely\n      farms and this gritty train.\"",
                "\"Oh, they don't mind it. Besides, things are changing. The auto, the\n      telephone, rural free delivery; they're bringing the farmers in closer\n      touch with the town. Takes time, you know, to change a wilderness like\n      this was fifty years ago. But already, why, they can hop into the Ford or\n      the Overland and get in to the movies on Saturday evening quicker than you\n      could get down to 'em by trolley in St. Paul.\"",
                "\"But if it's these towns we've been passing that the farmers run to for\n      relief from their bleakness --  -- Can't you understand? Just LOOK\n      at them!\"",
                "Kennicott was amazed. Ever since childhood he had seen these towns from\n      trains on this same line. He grumbled, \"Why, what's the matter with 'em?\n      Good hustling burgs. It would astonish you to know how much wheat and rye\n      and corn and potatoes they ship in a year.\"",
                "\"But they're so ugly.\"",
                "\"I'll admit they aren't comfy like Gopher Prairie. But give 'em time.\"",
                "\"What's the use of giving them time unless some one has desire and\n      training enough to plan them? Hundreds of factories trying to make\n      attractive motor cars, but these towns -- left to chance. No! That\n      can't be true. It must have taken genius to make them so scrawny!\"",
                "\"Oh, they're not so bad,\" was all he answered. He pretended that his hand\n      was the cat and hers the mouse. For the first time she tolerated him\n      rather than encouraged him. She was staring out at Schoenstrom, a hamlet\n      of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, at which the train was\n      stopping.",
                "A bearded German and his pucker-mouthed wife tugged their enormous\n      imitation-leather satchel from under a seat and waddled out. The station\n      agent hoisted a dead calf aboard the baggage-car. There were no other\n      visible activities in Schoenstrom. In the quiet of the halt, Carol could\n      hear a horse kicking his stall, a carpenter shingling a roof.",
                "The business-center of Schoenstrom took up one side of one block, facing\n      the railroad. It was a row of one-story shops covered with galvanized\n      iron, or with clapboards painted red and bilious yellow. The buildings\n      were as ill-assorted, as temporary-looking, as a mining-camp street in the\n      motion-pictures. The railroad station was a one-room frame box, a mirey\n      cattle-pen on one side and a crimson wheat-elevator on the other. The\n      elevator, with its cupola on the ridge of a shingled roof, resembled a\n      broad-shouldered man with a small, vicious, pointed head. The only\n      habitable structures to be seen were the florid red-brick Catholic church\n      and rectory at the end of Main Street.",
                "Carol picked at Kennicott's sleeve. \"You wouldn't call this a not-so-bad\n      town, would you?\"",
                "\"These Dutch burgs ARE kind of slow. Still, at that --  -- See that\n      fellow coming out of the general store there, getting into the big car? I\n      met him once. He owns about half the town, besides the store. Rauskukle,\n      his name is. He owns a lot of mortgages, and he gambles in farm-lands.\n      Good nut on him, that fellow. Why, they say he's worth three or four\n      hundred thousand dollars! Got a dandy great big yellow brick house with\n      tiled walks and a garden and everything, other end of town -- can't see\n      it from here -- I've gone past it when I've driven through here. Yes\n      sir!\"",
                "\"Then, if he has all that, there's no excuse whatever for this place! If\n      his three hundred thousand went back into the town, where it belongs, they\n      could burn up these shacks, and build a dream-village, a jewel! Why do the\n      farmers and the town-people let the Baron keep it?\"",
                "\"I must say I don't quite get you sometimes, Carrie. Let him? They can't\n      help themselves! He's a dumm old Dutchman, and probably the priest can\n      twist him around his finger, but when it comes to picking good farming\n      land, he's a regular wiz!\"",
                "\"I see. He's their symbol of beauty. The town erects him, instead of\n      erecting buildings.\"",
                "\"Honestly, don't know what you're driving at. You're kind of played out,\n      after this long trip. You'll feel better when you get home and have a good\n      bath, and put on the blue negligee. That's some vampire costume, you\n      witch!\"",
                "He squeezed her arm, looked at her knowingly.",
                "They moved on from the desert stillness of the Schoenstrom station. The\n      train creaked, banged, swayed. The air was nauseatingly thick. Kennicott\n      turned her face from the window, rested her head on his shoulder. She was\n      coaxed from her unhappy mood. But she came out of it unwillingly, and when\n      Kennicott was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries and had\n      opened a magazine of saffron detective stories, she sat upright.",
                "Here -- she meditated -- is the newest empire of the world; the\n      Northern Middlewest; a land of dairy herds and exquisite lakes, of new\n      automobiles and tar-paper shanties and silos like red towers, of clumsy\n      speech and a hope that is boundless. An empire which feeds a quarter of\n      the world -- yet its work is merely begun. They are pioneers, these\n      sweaty wayfarers, for all their telephones and bank-accounts and automatic\n      pianos and co-operative leagues. And for all its fat richness, theirs is a\n      pioneer land. What is its future? she wondered. A future of cities and\n      factory smut where now are loping empty fields? Homes universal and\n      secure? Or placid chateaux ringed with sullen huts? Youth free to find\n      knowledge and laughter? Willingness to sift the sanctified lies? Or\n      creamy-skinned fat women, smeared with grease and chalk, gorgeous in the\n      skins of beasts and the bloody feathers of slain birds, playing bridge\n      with puffy pink-nailed jeweled fingers, women who after much expenditure\n      of labor and bad temper still grotesquely resemble their own flatulent\n      lap-dogs? The ancient stale inequalities, or something different in\n      history, unlike the tedious maturity of other empires? What future and\n      what hope?",
                "Carol's head ached with the riddle.",
                "She saw the prairie, flat in giant patches or rolling in long hummocks.\n      The width and bigness of it, which had expanded her spirit an hour ago,\n      began to frighten her. It spread out so; it went on so uncontrollably; she\n      could never know it. Kennicott was closeted in his detective story. With\n      the loneliness which comes most depressingly in the midst of many people\n      she tried to forget problems, to look at the prairie objectively.",
                "The grass beside the railroad had been burnt over; it was a smudge prickly\n      with charred stalks of weeds. Beyond the undeviating barbed-wire fences\n      were clumps of golden rod. Only this thin hedge shut them off from the\n      plains-shorn wheat-lands of autumn, a hundred acres to a field, prickly\n      and gray near-by but in the blurred distance like tawny velvet stretched\n      over dipping hillocks. The long rows of wheat-shocks marched like soldiers\n      in worn yellow tabards. The newly plowed fields were black banners fallen\n      on the distant slope. It was a martial immensity, vigorous, a little\n      harsh, unsoftened by kindly gardens.",
                "The expanse was relieved by clumps of oaks with patches of short wild\n      grass; and every mile or two was a chain of cobalt slews, with the flicker\n      of blackbirds' wings across them.",
                "All this working land was turned into exuberance by the light. The\n      sunshine was dizzy on open stubble; shadows from immense cumulus clouds\n      were forever sliding across low mounds; and the sky was wider and loftier\n      and more resolutely blue than the sky of cities . . . she declared.",
                "\"It's a glorious country; a land to be big in,\" she crooned.",
                "Then Kennicott startled her by chuckling, \"D' you realize the town after\n      the next is Gopher Prairie? Home!\"",
                "III",
                "That one word -- home -- it terrified her. Had she really bound\n      herself to live, inescapably, in this town called Gopher Prairie? And this\n      thick man beside her, who dared to define her future, he was a stranger!\n      She turned in her seat, stared at him. Who was he? Why was he sitting with\n      her? He wasn't of her kind! His neck was heavy; his speech was heavy; he\n      was twelve or thirteen years older than she; and about him was none of the\n      magic of shared adventures and eagerness. She could not believe that she\n      had ever slept in his arms. That was one of the dreams which you had but\n      did not officially admit.",
                "She told herself how good he was, how dependable and understanding. She\n      touched his ear, smoothed the plane of his solid jaw, and, turning away\n      again, concentrated upon liking his town. It wouldn't be like these barren\n      settlements. It couldn't be! Why, it had three thousand population. That\n      was a great many people. There would be six hundred houses or more. And --  -- The\n      lakes near it would be so lovely. She'd seen them in the photographs. They\n      had looked charming . . . hadn't they?",
                "As the train left Wahkeenyan she began nervously to watch for the lakes -- the\n      entrance to all her future life. But when she discovered them, to the left\n      of the track, her only impression of them was that they resembled the\n      photographs.",
                "A mile from Gopher Prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge, and she\n      could see the town as a whole. With a passionate jerk she pushed up the\n      window, looked out, the arched fingers of her left hand trembling on the\n      sill, her right hand at her breast.",
                "And she saw that Gopher Prairie was merely an enlargement of all the\n      hamlets which they had been passing. Only to the eyes of a Kennicott was\n      it exceptional. The huddled low wooden houses broke the plains scarcely\n      more than would a hazel thicket. The fields swept up to it, past it. It\n      was unprotected and unprotecting; there was no dignity in it nor any hope\n      of greatness. Only the tall red grain-elevator and a few tinny\n      church-steeples rose from the mass. It was a frontier camp. It was not a\n      place to live in, not possibly, not conceivably.",
                "The people -- they'd be as drab as their houses, as flat as their\n      fields. She couldn't stay here. She would have to wrench loose from this\n      man, and flee.",
                "She peeped at him. She was at once helpless before his mature fixity, and\n      touched by his excitement as he sent his magazine skittering along the\n      aisle, stooped for their bags, came up with flushed face, and gloated,\n      \"Here we are!\"",
                "She smiled loyally, and looked away. The train was entering town. The\n      houses on the outskirts were dusky old red mansions with wooden frills, or\n      gaunt frame shelters like grocery boxes, or new bungalows with concrete\n      foundations imitating stone.",
                "Now the train was passing the elevator, the grim storage-tanks for oil, a\n      creamery, a lumber-yard, a stock-yard muddy and trampled and stinking. Now\n      they were stopping at a squat red frame station, the platform crowded with\n      unshaven farmers and with loafers -- unadventurous people with dead\n      eyes. She was here. She could not go on. It was the end -- the end of\n      the world. She sat with closed eyes, longing to push past Kennicott, hide\n      somewhere in the train, flee on toward the Pacific.",
                "Something large arose in her soul and commanded, \"Stop it! Stop being a\n      whining baby!\" She stood up quickly; she said, \"Isn't it wonderful to be\n      here at last!\"",
                "He trusted her so. She would make herself like the place. And she was\n      going to do tremendous things --  --",
                "She followed Kennicott and the bobbing ends of the two bags which he\n      carried. They were held back by the slow line of disembarking passengers.\n      She reminded herself that she was actually at the dramatic moment of the\n      bride's home-coming. She ought to feel exalted. She felt nothing at all\n      except irritation at their slow progress toward the door.",
                "Kennicott stooped to peer through the windows. He shyly exulted:",
                "\"Look! Look! There's a bunch come down to welcome us! Sam Clark and the\n      missus and Dave Dyer and Jack Elder, and, yes sir, Harry Haydock and\n      Juanita, and a whole crowd! I guess they see us now. Yuh, yuh sure, they\n      see us! See 'em waving!\"",
                "She obediently bent her head to look out at them. She had hold of herself.\n      She was ready to love them. But she was embarrassed by the heartiness of\n      the cheering group. From the vestibule she waved to them, but she clung a\n      second to the sleeve of the brakeman who helped her down before she had\n      the courage to dive into the cataract of hand-shaking people, people whom\n      she could not tell apart. She had the impression that all the men had\n      coarse voices, large damp hands, tooth-brush mustaches, bald spots, and\n      Masonic watch-charms.",
                "She knew that they were welcoming her. Their hands, their smiles, their\n      shouts, their affectionate eyes overcame her. She stammered, \"Thank you,\n      oh, thank you!\"",
                "One of the men was clamoring at Kennicott, \"I brought my machine down to\n      take you home, doc.\"",
                "\"Fine business, Sam!\" cried Kennicott; and, to Carol, \"Let's jump in. That\n      big Paige over there. Some boat, too, believe me! Sam can show speed to\n      any of these Marmons from Minneapolis!\"",
                "Only when she was in the motor car did she distinguish the three people\n      who were to accompany them. The owner, now at the wheel, was the essence\n      of decent self-satisfaction; a baldish, largish, level-eyed man, rugged of\n      neck but sleek and round of face -- face like the back of a spoon bowl.\n      He was chuckling at her, \"Have you got us all straight yet?\"",
                "\"Course she has! Trust Carrie to get things straight and get 'em darn\n      quick! I bet she could tell you every date in history!\" boasted her\n      husband.",
                "But the man looked at her reassuringly and with a certainty that he was a\n      person whom she could trust she confessed, \"As a matter of fact I haven't\n      got anybody straight.\"",
                "\"Course you haven't, child. Well, I'm Sam Clark, dealer in hardware,\n      sporting goods, cream separators, and almost any kind of heavy junk you\n      can think of. You can call me Sam -- anyway, I'm going to call you\n      Carrie, seein' 's you've been and gone and married this poor fish of a bum\n      medic that we keep round here.\" Carol smiled lavishly, and wished that she\n      called people by their given names more easily. \"The fat cranky lady back\n      there beside you, who is pretending that she can't hear me giving her\n      away, is Mrs. Sam'l Clark; and this hungry-looking squirt up here beside\n      me is Dave Dyer, who keeps his drug store running by not filling your\n      hubby's prescriptions right -- fact you might say he's the guy that put\n      the 'shun' in 'prescription.' So! Well, leave us take the bonny bride\n      home. Say, doc, I'll sell you the Candersen place for three thousand\n      plunks. Better be thinking about building a new home for Carrie. Prettiest\n      Frau in G. P., if you asks me!\"",
                "Contentedly Sam Clark drove off, in the heavy traffic of three Fords and\n      the Minniemashie House Free 'Bus.",
                "\"I shall like Mr. Clark . . . I CAN'T call him 'Sam'! They're all so\n      friendly.\" She glanced at the houses; tried not to see what she saw; gave\n      way in: \"Why do these stories lie so? They always make the bride's\n      home-coming a bower of roses. Complete trust in noble spouse. Lies about\n      marriage. I'm NOT changed. And this town -- O my God! I can't go\n      through with it. This junk-heap!\"",
                "Her husband bent over her. \"You look like you were in a brown study.\n      Scared? I don't expect you to think Gopher Prairie is a paradise, after\n      St. Paul. I don't expect you to be crazy about it, at first. But you'll\n      come to like it so much -- life's so free here and best people on\n      earth.\"",
                "She whispered to him (while Mrs. Clark considerately turned away), \"I love\n      you for understanding. I'm just -- I'm beastly over-sensitive. Too many\n      books. It's my lack of shoulder-muscles and sense. Give me time, dear.\"",
                "\"You bet! All the time you want!\"",

                "Kennicott had told her that, with his widowed mother as housekeeper, he\n      had occupied an old house, \"but nice and roomy, and well-heated, best\n      furnace I could find on the market.\" His mother had left Carol her love,\n      and gone back to Lac-qui-Meurt.",
                "It would be wonderful, she exulted, not to have to live in Other People's\n      Houses, but to make her own shrine. She held his hand tightly and stared\n      ahead as the car swung round a corner and stopped in the street before a\n      prosaic frame house in a small parched lawn.",

A screened porch with pillars of thin painted pine\n      surmounted by scrolls and brackets and bumps of jigsawed wood. No\n      shrubbery to shut off the public gaze.

                "\"It's a real home!\" She was moved by his humility. She gaily motioned\n      good-by to the Clarks.

The broad, straight,\n      unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie on every\n      side. She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land. The\n      skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away, at the north end of\n      Main Street, was like the ribs of a dead cow. She thought of the coming of\n      the Northern winter, when the unprotected houses would crouch together in\n      terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste.

But the thought would not hold. At best the trees\n      resembled a thinned woodlot. There was no park to rest the eyes. And since\n      not Gopher Prairie but Wakamin was the county-seat, there was no\n      court-house with its grounds.",

He leaned against the wall, scratched a while, sighed, and in a\n      bored way gossiped with a man tilted back in a chair. A lumber-wagon, its\n      long green box filled with large spools of barbed-wire fencing, creaked\n      down the block. A Ford, in reverse, sounded as though it were shaking to\n      pieces, then recovered and rattled away.

They were waiting for her! The determination to be all\n      one pretty flowerlet of appreciation leaked away. She begged of Sam, \"I\n      don't dare face them! They expect so much.

Now she\n      wished that she had piled it high. Her frock was an ingenue slip of lawn,\n      with a wide gold sash and a low square neck, which gave a suggestion of\n      throat and molded shoulders. But as they looked her over she was certain\n      that it was all wrong. She wished alternately that she had worn a\n      spinsterish high-necked dress, and that she had dared to shock them with a\n      violent brick-red scarf which she had bought in Chicago.",

He\n      was a distinguished bird of prey -- swooping thin nose, turtle mouth,\n      thick brows, port-wine cheeks, floss of white hair, contemptuous eyes. He\n      was not happy in the social changes of thirty years. Three decades ago,\n      Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh the lawyer, Merriman Peedy the\n      Congregational pastor and himself had been the arbiters. That was as it\n      should be; the fine arts -- medicine, law, religion, and finance -- recognized\n      as aristocratic; four Yankees democratically chatting with but ruling the\n      Ohioans and Illini and Swedes and Germans who had ventured to follow them.\n      But Westlake was old, almost retired; Julius Flickerbaugh had lost much of\n      his practice to livelier attorneys; Reverend (not The Reverend) Peedy was\n      dead; and nobody was impressed in this rotten age of automobiles by the\n      \"spanking grays\" which Ezra still drove. The town was as heterogeneous as\n      Chicago. Norwegians and Germans owned stores. The social leaders were\n      common merchants. Selling nails was considered as sacred as banking. These\n      upstarts -- the Clarks, the Haydocks -- had no dignity. They were\n      sound and conservative in politics, but they talked about motor cars and\n      pump-guns and heaven only knew what new-fangled fads. Mr. Stowbody felt\n      out of place with them. But his brick house with the mansard roof was\n      still the largest residence in town, and he held his position as squire by\n      occasionally appearing among the younger men and reminding them by a\n      wintry eye that without the banker none of them could carry on their\n      vulgar businesses.",

Ta ta ta rat!\" It was early and fresh, the air\n      whistling, frost bright on the golden rod. As the sun warmed the world of\n      stubble into a welter of yellow they turned from the highroad, through the\n      bars of a farmer's gate, into a field, slowly bumping over the uneven\n      earth. In a hollow of the rolling prairie they lost sight even of the\n      country road. It was warm and placid. Locusts trilled among the dry\n      wheat-stalks, and brilliant little flies hurtled across the buggy. A buzz\n      of content filled the air. Crows loitered and gossiped in the sky.",

The setter crawled ahead, his tail quivering, his\n      belly close to the stubble. Carol was nervous. She expected clouds of\n      large birds to fly up instantly. Her eyes were strained with staring. But\n      they followed the dog for a quarter of a mile, turning, doubling, crossing\n      two low hills, kicking through a swale of weeds, crawling between the\n      strands of a barbed-wire fence. The walking was hard on her\n      pavement-trained feet. The earth was lumpy, the stubble prickly and lined\n      with grass, thistles, abortive stumps of clover.

                "When he showed her the birds she had no sensation of blood. These heaps of\n      feathers were so soft and unbruised -- there was about them no hint of\n      death. She watched her conquering man tuck them into his inside pocket,\n      and trudged with him back to the buggy.",

The dooryard was of packed yellow clay,\n      treeless, barren of grass, littered with rusty plowshares and wheels of\n      discarded cultivators. Hardened trampled mud, like lava, filled the\n      pig-pen. The doors of the house were grime-rubbed, the corners and eaves\n      were rusted with rain, and the child who stared at them from the kitchen\n      window was smeary-faced. But beyond the barn was a clump of scarlet\n      geraniums; the prairie breeze was sunshine in motion; the flashing metal\n      blades of the windmill revolved with a lively hum; a horse neighed, a\n      rooster crowed, martins flew in and out of the cow-stable.",
                "A small spare woman with flaxen hair trotted from the house. She was\n      twanging a Swedish patois -- not in monotone, like English, but singing\n      it, with a lyrical whine:",

Mrs. Wilks, the Christian Science reader, is\n      a very bright woman -- though I am not a Scientist myself, in fact I\n      sing in the Episcopal choir. And Miss Sherwin of the high school -- she\n      is such a pleasing, bright girl -- I was fitting her to a pair of tan\n      gaiters yesterday, I declare, it really was a pleasure.\"",
                "\"Gimme the butter, Carrie,\" was Kennicott's comment. She defied him by\n      encouraging Raymie:",
                "\"Do you have amateur dramatics and so on here?\"",
                "\"Oh yes! The town's just full of talent. The Knights of Pythias put on a\n      dandy minstrel show last year.\"",
                "\"It's nice you're so enthusiastic.\"",
                "\"Oh, do you really think so? Lots of folks jolly me for trying to get up\n      shows and so on. I tell them they have more artistic gifts than they know.\n      Just yesterday I was saying to Harry Haydock: if he would read poetry,\n      like Longfellow, or if he would join the band -- I get so much pleasure\n      out of playing the cornet, and our band-leader, Del Snafflin, is such a\n      good musician, I often say he ought to give up his barbering and become a\n      professional musician, he could play the clarinet in Minneapolis or New\n      York or anywhere, but -- but I couldn't get Harry to see it at all and -- I\n      hear you and the doctor went out hunting yesterday. Lovely country, isn't\n      it. And did you make some calls? The mercantile life isn't inspiring like\n      medicine. It must be wonderful to see how patients trust you, doctor.\"",
                "\"Huh. It's me that's got to do all the trusting. Be damn sight more\n      wonderful 'f they'd pay their bills,\" grumbled Kennicott and, to Carol, he\n      whispered something which sounded like \"gentleman hen.\"",
                "But Raymie's pale eyes were watering at her. She helped him with, \"So you\n      like to read poetry?\"",
                "\"Oh yes, so much -- though to tell the truth, I don't get much time for\n      reading, we're always so busy at the store and --  -- But we had the\n      dandiest professional reciter at the Pythian Sisters sociable last\n      winter.\"",
                "Carol thought she heard a grunt from the traveling salesman at the end of\n      the table, and Kennicott's jerking elbow was a grunt embodied. She\n      persisted:",
                "\"Do you get to see many plays, Mr. Wutherspoon?\"",
                "He shone at her like a dim blue March moon, and sighed, \"No, but I do love\n      the movies. I'm a real fan. One trouble with books is that they're not so\n      thoroughly safeguarded by intelligent censors as the movies are, and when\n      you drop into the library and take out a book you never know what you're\n      wasting your time on. What I like in books is a wholesome, really\n      improving story, and sometimes --  -- Why, once I started a novel by\n      this fellow Balzac that you read about, and it told how a lady wasn't\n      living with her husband, I mean she wasn't his wife. It went into details,\n      disgustingly! And the English was real poor. I spoke to the library about\n      it, and they took it off the shelves. I'm not narrow, but I must say I\n      don't see any use in this deliberately dragging in immorality! Life itself\n      is so full of temptations that in literature one wants only that which is\n      pure and uplifting.\"",
                "\"What's the name of that Balzac yarn? Where can I get hold of it?\" giggled\n      the traveling salesman.",

H.,' I always call him, and he asked me\n      how I liked it, and I said to him, 'Look here, D. H.,' I said -- you\n      see, he was going to leave the front plain, and I said to him, 'It's all\n      very well to have modern lighting and a big display-space,' I said, 'but\n      when you get that in, you want to have some architecture, too,' I said,\n      and he laughed and said he guessed maybe I was right, and so he had 'em\n      put on a cornice.\"",

                "One of the most charming affairs of the season was held Tuesday evening at\n      the handsome new residence of Sam and Mrs. Clark when many of our most\n      prominent citizens gathered to greet the lovely new bride of our popular\n      local physician, Dr. Will Kennicott. All present spoke of the many charms\n      of the bride, formerly Miss Carol Milford of St. Paul. Games and stunts\n      were the order of the day, with merry talk and conversation. At a late\n      hour dainty refreshments were served, and the party broke up with many\n      expressions of pleasure at the pleasant affair. Among those present were\n      Mesdames Kennicott, Elder --  --",
                "Dr. Will Kennicott, for the past several years one of our most popular and\n      skilful physicians and surgeons, gave the town a delightful surprise when\n      he returned from an extended honeymoon tour in Colorado this week with his\n      charming bride, nee Miss Carol Milford of St. Paul, whose family are\n      socially prominent in Minneapolis and Mankato. Mrs. Kennicott is a lady of\n      manifold charms, not only of striking charm of appearance but is also a\n      distinguished graduate of a school in the East and has for the past year\n      been prominently connected in an important position of responsibility with\n      the St. Paul Public Library, in which city Dr. \"Will\" had the good fortune\n      to meet her. The city of Gopher Prairie welcomes her to our midst and\n      prophesies for her many happy years in the energetic city of the twin\n      lakes and the future. The Dr. and Mrs. Kennicott will reside for the\n      present at the Doctor's home on Poplar Street which his charming mother\n      has been keeping for him who has now returned to her own home at\n      Lac-qui-Meurt leaving a host of friends who regret her absence and hope to\n      see her soon with us again.",
                "IV",
                "She knew that if she was ever to effect any of the \"reforms\" which she had\n      pictured, she must have a starting-place. What confused her during the\n      three or four months after her marriage was not lack of perception that\n      she must be definite, but sheer careless happiness of her first home.",
                "In the pride of being a housewife she loved every detail -- the brocade\n      armchair with the weak back, even the brass water-cock on the hot-water\n      reservoir, when she had become familiar with it by trying to scour it to\n      brilliance.",
                "She found a maid -- plump radiant Bea Sorenson from Scandia Crossing.\n      Bea was droll in her attempt to be at once a respectful servant and a\n      bosom friend. They laughed together over the fact that the stove did not\n      draw, over the slipperiness of fish in the pan.",
                "Like a child playing Grandma in a trailing skirt, Carol paraded uptown for\n      her marketing, crying greetings to housewives along the way. Everybody\n      bowed to her, strangers and all, and made her feel that they wanted her,\n      that she belonged here. In city shops she was merely A Customer -- a\n      hat, a voice to bore a harassed clerk. Here she was Mrs. Doc Kennicott,\n      and her preferences in grape-fruit and manners were known and remembered\n      and worth discussing . . . even if they weren't worth fulfilling.",
                "Shopping was a delight of brisk conferences. The very merchants whose\n      droning she found the dullest at the two or three parties which were given\n      to welcome her were the pleasantest confidants of all when they had\n      something to talk about -- lemons or cotton voile or floor-oil. With\n      that skip-jack Dave Dyer, the druggist, she conducted a long mock-quarrel.\n      She pretended that he cheated her in the price of magazines and candy; he\n      pretended she was a detective from the Twin Cities. He hid behind the\n      prescription-counter, and when she stamped her foot he came out wailing,\n      \"Honest, I haven't done nothing crooked today -- not yet.\"",
                "She never recalled her first impression of Main Street; never had\n      precisely the same despair at its ugliness. By the end of two\n      shopping-tours everything had changed proportions. As she never entered\n      it, the Minniemashie House ceased to exist for her. Clark's Hardware\n      Store, Dyer's Drug Store, the groceries of Ole Jenson and Frederick\n      Ludelmeyer and Howland & Gould, the meat markets, the notions shop -- they\n      expanded, and hid all other structures. When she entered Mr. Ludelmeyer's\n      store and he wheezed, \"Goot mornin', Mrs. Kennicott. Vell, dis iss a fine\n      day,\" she did not notice the dustiness of the shelves nor the stupidity of\n      the girl clerk; and she did not remember the mute colloquy with him on her\n      first view of Main Street.",
                "She could not find half the kinds of food she wanted, but that made\n      shopping more of an adventure. When she did contrive to get sweetbreads at\n      Dahl & Oleson's Meat Market the triumph was so vast that she buzzed\n      with excitement and admired the strong wise butcher, Mr. Dahl.",
                "She appreciated the homely ease of village life. She liked the old men,\n      farmers, G.A.R. veterans, who when they gossiped sometimes squatted on\n      their heels on the sidewalk, like resting Indians, and reflectively spat\n      over the curb.",
                "She found beauty in the children.",
                "She had suspected that her married friends exaggerated their passion for\n      children. But in her work in the library, children had become individuals\n      to her, citizens of the State with their own rights and their own senses\n      of humor. In the library she had not had much time to give them, but now\n      she knew the luxury of stopping, gravely asking Bessie Clark whether her\n      doll had yet recovered from its rheumatism, and agreeing with Oscar\n      Martinsen that it would be Good Fun to go trapping \"mushrats.\"",
                "She touched the thought, \"It would be sweet to have a baby of my own. I do\n      want one. Tiny --  -- No! Not yet! There's so much to do. And I'm\n      still tired from the job. It's in my bones.\"",
                "She rested at home. She listened to the village noises common to all the\n      world, jungle or prairie; sounds simple and charged with magic -- dogs\n      barking, chickens making a gurgling sound of content, children at play, a\n      man beating a rug, wind in the cottonwood trees, a locust fiddling, a\n      footstep on the walk, jaunty voices of Bea and a grocer's boy in the\n      kitchen, a clinking anvil, a piano -- not too near.",
                "Twice a week, at least, she drove into the country with Kennicott, to hunt\n      ducks in lakes enameled with sunset, or to call on patients who looked up\n      to her as the squire's lady and thanked her for toys and magazines.\n      Evenings she went with her husband to the motion pictures and was\n      boisterously greeted by every other couple; or, till it became too cold,\n      they sat on the porch, bawling to passers-by in motors, or to neighbors\n      who were raking the leaves. The dust became golden in the low sun; the\n      street was filled with the fragrance of burning leaves.",
                "V",
                "But she hazily wanted some one to whom she could say what she thought.",
                "On a slow afternoon when she fidgeted over sewing and wished that the\n      telephone would ring, Bea announced Miss Vida Sherwin.",
                "Despite Vida Sherwin's lively blue eyes, if you had looked at her in\n      detail you would have found her face slightly lined, and not so much\n      sallow as with the bloom rubbed off; you would have found her chest flat,\n      and her fingers rough from needle and chalk and penholder; her blouses and\n      plain cloth skirts undistinguished; and her hat worn too far back,\n      betraying a dry forehead. But you never did look at Vida Sherwin in\n      detail. You couldn't. Her electric activity veiled her. She was as\n      energetic as a chipmunk. Her fingers fluttered; her sympathy came out in\n      spurts; she sat on the edge of a chair in eagerness to be near her\n      auditor, to send her enthusiasms and optimism across.",
                "She rushed into the room pouring out: \"I'm afraid you'll think the\n      teachers have been shabby in not coming near you, but we wanted to give\n      you a chance to get settled. I am Vida Sherwin, and I try to teach French\n      and English and a few other things in the high school.\"",
                "\"I've been hoping to know the teachers. You see, I was a librarian --  -- \"",
                "\"Oh, you needn't tell me. I know all about you! Awful how much I know -- this\n      gossipy village. We need you so much here. It's a dear loyal town (and\n      isn't loyalty the finest thing in the world!) but it's a rough diamond,\n      and we need you for the polishing, and we're ever so humble --  -- \"\n       She stopped for breath and finished her compliment with a smile.",
                "\"If I COULD help you in any way --  -- Would I be committing the\n      unpardonable sin if I whispered that I think Gopher Prairie is a tiny bit\n      ugly?\"",
                "\"Of course it's ugly. Dreadfully! Though I'm probably the only person in\n      town to whom you could safely say that. (Except perhaps Guy Pollock the\n      lawyer -- have you met him? -- oh, you MUST! -- he's simply a\n      darling -- intelligence and culture and so gentle.) But I don't care so\n      much about the ugliness. That will change. It's the spirit that gives me\n      hope. It's sound. Wholesome. But afraid. It needs live creatures like you\n      to awaken it. I shall slave-drive you!\"",
                "\"Splendid. What shall I do? I've been wondering if it would be possible to\n      have a good architect come here to lecture.\"",
                "\"Ye-es, but don't you think it would be better to work with existing\n      agencies? Perhaps it will sound slow to you, but I was thinking --  -- It\n      would be lovely if we could get you to teach Sunday School.\"",
                "Carol had the empty expression of one who finds that she has been\n      affectionately bowing to a complete stranger. \"Oh yes. But I'm afraid I\n      wouldn't be much good at that. My religion is so foggy.\"",
                "\"I know. So is mine. I don't care a bit for dogma. Though I do stick\n      firmly to the belief in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man\n      and the leadership of Jesus. As you do, of course.\"",
                "Carol looked respectable and thought about having tea.",
                "\"And that's all you need teach in Sunday School. It's the personal\n      influence. Then there's the library-board. You'd be so useful on that. And\n      of course there's our women's study club -- the Thanatopsis Club.\"",
                "\"Are they doing anything? Or do they read papers made out of the\n      Encyclopedia?\"",
                "Miss Sherwin shrugged. \"Perhaps. But still, they are so earnest. They will\n      respond to your fresher interest. And the Thanatopsis does do a good\n      social work -- they've made the city plant ever so many trees, and they\n      run the rest-room for farmers' wives. And they do take such an interest in\n      refinement and culture. So -- in fact, so very unique.\"",
                "Carol was disappointed -- by nothing very tangible. She said politely,\n      \"I'll think them all over. I must have a while to look around first.\"",
                "Miss Sherwin darted to her, smoothed her hair, peered at her. \"Oh, my\n      dear, don't you suppose I know? These first tender days of marriage -- they're\n      sacred to me. Home, and children that need you, and depend on you to keep\n      them alive, and turn to you with their wrinkly little smiles. And the\n      hearth and --  -- \" She hid her face from Carol as she made an\n      activity of patting the cushion of her chair, but she went on with her\n      former briskness:",
                "\"I mean, you must help us when you're ready. . . . I'm afraid you'll think\n      I'm conservative. I am! So much to conserve. All this treasure of American\n      ideals.

I have only one good quality -- overwhelming belief in the\n      brains and hearts of our nation, our state, our town.

But at the entrance of Guy Pollock she\n      discovered a personality. Pollock was a man of perhaps thirty-eight,\n      slender, still, deferential. His voice was low. \"It was very good of you\n      to want me,\" he said, and he offered no humorous remarks, and did not ask\n      her if she didn't think Gopher Prairie was \"the livest little burg in the\n      state.\"",

                "Carol wondered why Guy Pollock went on digging at routine law-cases; why\n      he remained in Gopher Prairie. She had no one whom she could ask. Neither\n      Kennicott nor Vida Sherwin would understand that there might be reasons\n      why a Pollock should not remain in Gopher Prairie. She enjoyed the faint\n      mystery. She felt triumphant and rather literary. She already had a Group.\n      It would be only a while now before she provided the town with fanlights\n      and a knowledge of Galsworthy.

                "Carpenters had torn out the partition between front parlor and back\n      parlor, thrown it into a long room on which she lavished yellow and deep\n      blue; a Japanese obi with an intricacy of gold thread on stiff ultramarine\n      tissue, which she hung as a panel against the maize wall; a couch with\n      pillows of sapphire velvet and gold bands; chairs which, in Gopher\n      Prairie, seemed flippant. She hid the sacred family phonograph in the\n      dining-room, and replaced its stand with a square cabinet on which was a\n      squat blue jar between yellow candles.",

She caught herself criticizing his belief that,\n      since his joke about trying to keep her out of the poorhouse had once been\n      accepted as admirable humor, it should continue to be his daily bon mot.\n      It was a nuisance to have to run down the street after him because she had\n      forgotten to ask him for money at breakfast.",

She was in a silver sheath, the calyx of a\n      lily, her piled hair like black glass; she had the fragility and\n      costliness of a Viennese goblet; and her eyes were intense. He was stirred\n      to rise from the table and to hold the chair for her; and all through\n      supper he ate his bread dry because he felt that she would think him\n      common if he said \"Will you hand me the butter?\"",

She was amused. But her high spirits slackened as she\n      beheld them form in dress parade, in a long, silent, uneasy circle clear\n      round the living-room.

                "Even the millionaire Dawsons and Ezra Stowbody and \"Professor\" George\n      Edwin Mott danced, looking only slightly foolish; and by rushing about the\n      room and being coy and coaxing to all persons over forty-five, Carol got\n      them into a waltz and a Virginia Reel. But when she left them to disenjoy\n      themselves in their own way Harry Haydock put a one-step record on the\n      phonograph, the younger people took the floor, and all the elders sneaked\n      back to their chairs, with crystallized smiles which meant, \"Don't believe\n      I'll try this one myself, but I do enjoy watching the youngsters dance.\"",
                "Half of them were silent; half resumed the discussions of that afternoon\n      in the store. Ezra Stowbody hunted for something to say, hid a yawn, and\n      offered to Lyman Cass, the owner of the flour-mill, \"How d' you folks like\n      the new furnace, Lym? Huh? So.\"",
                "\"Oh, let them alone. Don't pester them. They must like it, or they\n      wouldn't do it.\" Carol warned herself. But they gazed at her so\n      expectantly when she flickered past that she was reconvinced that in their\n      debauches of respectability they had lost the power of play as well as the\n      power of impersonal thought. Even the dancers were gradually crushed by\n      the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and well-behaved and negative\n      minds; and they sat down, two by two. In twenty minutes the party was\n      again elevated to the decorum of a prayer-meeting.",
                "\"We're going to do something exciting,\" Carol exclaimed to her new\n      confidante, Vida Sherwin. She saw that in the growing quiet her voice had\n      carried across the room. Nat Hicks, Ella Stowbody, and Dave Dyer were\n      abstracted, fingers and lips slightly moving. She knew with a cold\n      certainty that Dave was rehearsing his \"stunt\" about the Norwegian\n      catching the hen, Ella running over the first lines of \"An Old Sweetheart\n      of Mine,\" and Nat thinking of his popular parody on Mark Antony's oration.",
                "\"But I will not have anybody use the word 'stunt' in my house,\" she\n      whispered to Miss Sherwin.",

                "Carol apologized for her superciliousness. She urged Raymie, and warned\n      the planners of \"stunts,\" \"We all want you to sing, Mr. Wutherspoon.\n      You're the only famous actor I'm going to let appear on the stage\n      tonight.\"",
                "While Raymie blushed and admitted, \"Oh, they don't want to hear me,\" he\n      was clearing his throat, pulling his clean handkerchief farther out of his\n      breast pocket, and thrusting his fingers between the buttons of his vest.",
                "In her affection for Raymie's defender, in her desire to \"discover\n      artistic talent,\" Carol prepared to be delighted by the recital.",

She tried to look admiring, for the\n      benefit of Miss Sherwin, that trusting admirer of all that was or\n      conceivably could be the good, the true, and the beautiful.",

                "Carol lied blackly and magnificently, but without originality: \"Oh yes, I\n      do think he has so much FEELING!\"",

                "When the sheep had been penned up, in the darkness the timorous wolves\n      crept into the living-room, squealing, halting, thrown out of their habit\n      of stolidity by the strangeness of advancing through nothingness toward a\n      waiting foe, a mysterious foe which expanded and grew more menacing. The\n      wolves peered to make out landmarks, they touched gliding arms which did\n      not seem to be attached to a body, they quivered with a rapture of fear.\n      Reality had vanished. A yelping squabble suddenly rose, then Juanita\n      Haydock's high titter, and Guy Pollock's astonished, \"Ouch! Quit! You're\n      scalping me!\"",
                "Mrs. Luke Dawson galloped backward on stiff hands and knees into the\n      safety of the lighted hallway, moaning, \"I declare, I nev' was so upset in\n      my life!\" But the propriety was shaken out of her, and she delightedly\n      continued to ejaculate \"Nev' in my LIFE\" as she saw the living-room door\n      opened by invisible hands and shoes hurling through it, as she heard from\n      the darkness beyond the door a squawling, a bumping, a resolute \"Here's a\n      lot of shoes. Come on, you wolves. Ow! Y' would, would you!\"",
                "When Carol abruptly turned on the lights in the embattled living-room,\n      half of the company were sitting back against the walls, where they had\n      craftily remained throughout the engagement, but in the middle of the\n      floor Kennicott was wrestling with Harry Haydock -- their collars torn\n      off, their hair in their eyes; and the owlish Mr. Julius Flickerbaugh was\n      retreating from Juanita Haydock, and gulping with unaccustomed laughter.\n      Guy Pollock's discreet brown scarf hung down his back. Young Rita Simons's\n      net blouse had lost two buttons, and betrayed more of her delicious plump\n      shoulder than was regarded as pure in Gopher Prairie. Whether by shock,\n      disgust, joy of combat, or physical activity, all the party were freed\n      from their years of social decorum. George Edwin Mott giggled; Luke Dawson\n      twisted his beard; Mrs. Clark insisted, \"I did too, Sam -- I got a shoe -- I\n      never knew I could fight so terrible!\"",
                "Carol was certain that she was a great reformer.",
                "She mercifully had combs, mirrors, brushes, needle and thread ready. She\n      permitted them to restore the divine decency of buttons.",
                "The grinning Bea brought down-stairs a pile of soft thick sheets of paper\n      with designs of lotos blossoms, dragons, apes, in cobalt and crimson and\n      gray, and patterns of purple birds flying among sea-green trees in the\n      valleys of Nowhere.",
                "\"These,\" Carol announced, \"are real Chinese masquerade costumes. I got\n      them from an importing shop in Minneapolis. You are to put them on over\n      your clothes, and please forget that you are Minnesotans, and turn into\n      mandarins and coolies and -- and samurai (isn't it?), and anything else\n      you can think of.\"",
                "While they were shyly rustling the paper costumes she disappeared. Ten\n      minutes after she gazed down from the stairs upon grotesquely ruddy Yankee\n      heads above Oriental robes, and cried to them, \"The Princess Winky Poo\n      salutes her court!\"",
                "As they looked up she caught their suspense of admiration. They saw an\n      airy figure in trousers and coat of green brocade edged with gold; a high\n      gold collar under a proud chin; black hair pierced with jade pins; a\n      languid peacock fan in an out-stretched hand; eyes uplifted to a vision of\n      pagoda towers. When she dropped her pose and smiled down she discovered\n      Kennicott apoplectic with domestic pride -- and gray Guy Pollock\n      staring beseechingly. For a second she saw nothing in all the pink and\n      brown mass of their faces save the hunger of the two men.",
                "She shook off the spell and ran down. \"We're going to have a real Chinese\n      concert. Messrs. Pollock, Kennicott, and, well, Stowbody are drummers; the\n      rest of us sing and play the fife.\"",
                "The fifes were combs with tissue paper; the drums were tabourets and the\n      sewing-table. Loren Wheeler, editor of the Dauntless, led the orchestra,\n      with a ruler and a totally inaccurate sense of rhythm. The music was a\n      reminiscence of tom-toms heard at circus fortune-telling tents or at the\n      Minnesota State Fair, but the whole company pounded and puffed and whined\n      in a sing-song, and looked rapturous.",
                "Before they were quite tired of the concert Carol led them in a dancing\n      procession to the dining-room, to blue bowls of chow mein, with Lichee\n      nuts and ginger preserved in syrup.",
                "None of them save that city-rounder Harry Haydock had heard of any Chinese\n      dish except chop sooey. With agreeable doubt they ventured through the\n      bamboo shoots into the golden fried noodles of the chow mein; and Dave\n      Dyer did a not very humorous Chinese dance with Nat Hicks; and there was\n      hubbub and contentment.",
                "Carol relaxed, and found that she was shockingly tired. She had carried\n      them on her thin shoulders. She could not keep it up. She longed for her\n      father, that artist at creating hysterical parties. She thought of smoking\n      a cigarette, to shock them, and dismissed the obscene thought before it\n      was quite formed. She wondered whether they could for five minutes be\n      coaxed to talk about something besides the winter top of Knute Stamquist's\n      Ford, and what Al Tingley had said about his mother-in-law. She sighed,\n      \"Oh, let 'em alone. I've done enough.\" She crossed her trousered legs, and\n      snuggled luxuriously above her saucer of ginger; she caught Pollock's\n      congratulatory still smile, and thought well of herself for having thrown\n      a rose light on the pallid lawyer; repented the heretical supposition that\n      any male save her husband existed; jumped up to find Kennicott and\n      whisper, \"Happy, my lord? . . . No, it didn't cost much!\"",
                "\"Best party this town ever saw. Only --  -- Don't cross your legs in\n      that costume. Shows your knees too plain.\"",
                "She was vexed. She resented his clumsiness. She returned to Guy Pollock\n      and talked of Chinese religions -- not that she knew anything whatever\n      about Chinese religions, but he had read a book on the subject as, on\n      lonely evenings in his office, he had read at least one book on every\n      subject in the world. Guy's thin maturity was changing in her vision to\n      flushed youth and they were roaming an island in the yellow sea of chatter\n      when she realized that the guests were beginning that cough which\n      indicated, in the universal instinctive language, that they desired to go\n      home and go to bed.",
                "While they asserted that it had been \"the nicest party they'd ever seen -- my!\n      so clever and original,\" she smiled tremendously, shook hands, and cried\n      many suitable things regarding children, and being sure to wrap up warmly,\n      and Raymie's singing and Juanita Haydock's prowess at games. Then she\n      turned wearily to Kennicott in a house filled with quiet and crumbs and\n      shreds of Chinese costumes.",
                "He was gurgling, \"I tell you, Carrie, you certainly are a wonder, and\n      guess you're right about waking folks up. Now you've showed 'em how, they\n      won't go on having the same old kind of parties and stunts and everything.\n      Here! Don't touch a thing! Done enough. Pop up to bed, and I'll clear up.\"",
                "His wise surgeon's-hands stroked her shoulder, and her irritation at his\n      clumsiness was lost in his strength.",

                "One of the most delightful social events of recent months was held\n      Wednesday evening in the housewarming of Dr. and Mrs. Kennicott, who have\n      completely redecorated their charming home on Poplar Street, and is now\n      extremely nifty in modern color scheme. The doctor and his bride were at\n      home to their numerous friends and a number of novelties in diversions\n      were held, including a Chinese orchestra in original and genuine Oriental\n      costumes, of which Ye Editor was leader. Dainty refreshments were served\n      in true Oriental style, and one and all voted a delightful time.",

                "GOPHER PRAIRIE was digging in for the winter. Through late November and\n      all December it snowed daily; the thermometer was at zero and might drop\n      to twenty below, or thirty. Winter is not a season in the North\n      Middlewest; it is an industry. Storm sheds were erected at every door. In\n      every block the householders, Sam Clark, the wealthy Mr. Dawson, all save\n      asthmatic Ezra Stowbody who extravagantly hired a boy, were seen\n      perilously staggering up ladders, carrying storm windows and screwing them\n      to second-story jambs. While Kennicott put up his windows Carol danced\n      inside the bedrooms and begged him not to swallow the screws, which he\n      held in his mouth like an extraordinary set of external false teeth.",
                "The universal sign of winter was the town handyman -- Miles Bjornstam,\n      a tall, thick, red-mustached bachelor, opinionated atheist, general-store\n      arguer, cynical Santa Claus. Children loved him, and he sneaked away from\n      work to tell them improbable stories of sea-faring and horse-trading and\n      bears. The children's parents either laughed at him or hated him. He was\n      the one democrat in town. He called both Lyman Cass the miller and the\n      Finn homesteader from Lost Lake by their first names. He was known as \"The\n      Red Swede,\" and considered slightly insane.",
                "Bjornstam could do anything with his hands -- solder a pan, weld an\n      automobile spring, soothe a frightened filly, tinker a clock, carve a\n      Gloucester schooner which magically went into a bottle. Now, for a week,\n      he was commissioner general of Gopher Prairie. He was the only person\n      besides the repairman at Sam Clark's who understood plumbing. Everybody\n      begged him to look over the furnace and the water-pipes. He rushed from\n      house to house till after bedtime -- ten o'clock. Icicles from burst\n      water-pipes hung along the skirt of his brown dog-skin overcoat; his plush\n      cap, which he never took off in the house, was a pulp of ice and\n      coal-dust; his red hands were cracked to rawness; he chewed the stub of a\n      cigar.",
                "But he was courtly to Carol. He stooped to examine the furnace flues; he\n      straightened, glanced down at her, and hemmed, \"Got to fix your furnace,\n      no matter what else I do.\"",
                "The poorer houses of Gopher Prairie, where the services of Miles Bjornstam\n      were a luxury -- which included the shanty of Miles Bjornstam -- were\n      banked to the lower windows with earth and manure. Along the railroad the\n      sections of snow fence, which had been stacked all summer in romantic\n      wooden tents occupied by roving small boys, were set up to prevent drifts\n      from covering the track.",
                "The farmers came into town in home-made sleighs, with bed-quilts and hay\n      piled in the rough boxes.",
                "Fur coats, fur caps, fur mittens, overshoes buckling almost to the knees,\n      gray knitted scarfs ten feet long, thick woolen socks, canvas jackets\n      lined with fluffy yellow wool like the plumage of ducklings, moccasins,\n      red flannel wristlets for the blazing chapped wrists of boys -- these\n      protections against winter were busily dug out of moth-ball-sprinkled\n      drawers and tar-bags in closets, and all over town small boys were\n      squealing, \"Oh, there's my mittens!\" or \"Look at my shoe-packs!\" There is\n      so sharp a division between the panting summer and the stinging winter of\n      the Northern plains that they rediscovered with surprise and a feeling of\n      heroism this armor of an Artic explorer.",
                "Winter garments surpassed even personal gossip as the topic at parties. It\n      was good form to ask, \"Put on your heavies yet?\" There were as many\n      distinctions in wraps as in motor cars. The lesser sort appeared in yellow\n      and black dogskin coats, but Kennicott was lordly in a long raccoon ulster\n      and a new seal cap. When the snow was too deep for his motor he went off\n      on country calls in a shiny, floral, steel-tipped cutter, only his ruddy\n      nose and his cigar emerging from the fur.",
                "Carol herself stirred Main Street by a loose coat of nutria. Her\n      finger-tips loved the silken fur.",
                "Her liveliest activity now was organizing outdoor sports in the\n      motor-paralyzed town.",
                "The automobile and bridge-whist had not only made more evident the social\n      divisions in Gopher Prairie but they had also enfeebled the love of\n      activity. It was so rich-looking to sit and drive -- and so easy.\n      Skiing and sliding were \"stupid\" and \"old-fashioned.\" In fact, the village\n      longed for the elegance of city recreations almost as much as the cities\n      longed for village sports; and Gopher Prairie took as much pride in\n      neglecting coasting as St. Paul -- or New York -- in going coasting.\n      Carol did inspire a successful skating-party in mid-November. Plover Lake\n      glistened in clear sweeps of gray-green ice, ringing to the skates. On\n      shore the ice-tipped reeds clattered in the wind, and oak twigs with\n      stubborn last leaves hung against a milky sky. Harry Haydock did\n      figure-eights, and Carol was certain that she had found the perfect life.\n      But when snow had ended the skating and she tried to get up a moonlight\n      sliding party, the matrons hesitated to stir away from their radiators and\n      their daily bridge-whist imitations of the city. She had to nag them. They\n      scooted down a long hill on a bob-sled, they upset and got snow down their\n      necks they shrieked that they would do it again immediately -- and they\n      did not do it again at all.",
                "She badgered another group into going skiing. They shouted and threw\n      snowballs, and informed her that it was SUCH fun, and they'd have another\n      skiing expedition right away, and they jollily returned home and never\n      thereafter left their manuals of bridge.",
                "Carol was discouraged. She was grateful when Kennicott invited her to go\n      rabbit-hunting in the woods. She waded down stilly cloisters between burnt\n      stump and icy oak, through drifts marked with a million hieroglyphics of\n      rabbit and mouse and bird. She squealed as he leaped on a pile of brush\n      and fired at the rabbit which ran out. He belonged there, masculine in\n      reefer and sweater and high-laced boots. That night she ate prodigiously\n      of steak and fried potatoes; she produced electric sparks by touching his\n      ear with her finger-tip; she slept twelve hours; and awoke to think how\n      glorious was this brave land.",
                "She rose to a radiance of sun on snow. Snug in her furs she trotted\n      up-town. Frosted shingles smoked against a sky colored like flax-blossoms,\n      sleigh-bells clinked, shouts of greeting were loud in the thin bright air,\n      and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of wood-sawing. It was Saturday, and\n      the neighbors' sons were getting up the winter fuel. Behind walls of\n      corded wood in back yards their sawbucks stood in depressions scattered\n      with canary-yellow flakes of sawdust. The frames of their buck-saws were\n      cherry-red, the blades blued steel, and the fresh cut ends of the sticks -- poplar,\n      maple, iron-wood, birch -- were marked with engraved rings of growth.\n      The boys wore shoe-packs, blue flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons,\n      and mackinaws of crimson, lemon yellow, and foxy brown.",
                "Carol cried \"Fine day!\" to the boys; she came in a glow to Howland &\n      Gould's grocery, her collar white with frost from her breath; she bought a\n      can of tomatoes as though it were Orient fruit; and returned home planning\n      to surprise Kennicott with an omelet creole for dinner.",
                "So brilliant was the snow-glare that when she entered the house she saw\n      the door-knobs, the newspaper on the table, every white surface as\n      dazzling mauve, and her head was dizzy in the pyrotechnic dimness. When\n      her eyes had recovered she felt expanded, drunk with health, mistress of\n      life. The world was so luminous that she sat down at her rickety little\n      desk in the living-room to make a poem. (She got no farther than \"The sky\n      is bright, the sun is warm, there ne'er will be another storm.\")",
                "In the mid-afternoon of this same day Kennicott was called into the\n      country. It was Bea's evening out -- her evening for the Lutheran\n      Dance. Carol was alone from three till midnight. She wearied of reading\n      pure love stories in the magazines and sat by a radiator, beginning to\n      brood.",
                "Thus she chanced to discover that she had nothing to do.",
                "II",
                "She had, she meditated, passed through the novelty of seeing the town and\n      meeting people, of skating and sliding and hunting. Bea was competent;\n      there was no household labor except sewing and darning and gossipy\n      assistance to Bea in bed-making. She couldn't satisfy her ingenuity in\n      planning meals. At Dahl & Oleson's Meat Market you didn't give orders -- you\n      wofully inquired whether there was anything today besides steak and pork\n      and ham. The cuts of beef were not cuts. They were hacks. Lamb chops were\n      as exotic as sharks' fins. The meat-dealers shipped their best to the\n      city, with its higher prices.",
                "In all the shops there was the same lack of choice. She could not find a\n      glass-headed picture-nail in town; she did not hunt for the sort of\n      veiling she wanted -- she took what she could get; and only at Howland\n      & Gould's was there such a luxury as canned asparagus. Routine care\n      was all she could devote to the house. Only by such fussing as the Widow\n      Bogart's could she make it fill her time.",
                "She could not have outside employment. To the village doctor's wife it was\n      taboo.",
                "She was a woman with a working brain and no work.",
                "There were only three things which she could do: Have children; start her\n      career of reforming; or become so definitely a part of the town that she\n      would be fulfilled by the activities of church and study-club and\n      bridge-parties.",
                "Children, yes, she wanted them, but --  -- She was not quite ready.\n      She had been embarrassed by Kennicott's frankness, but she agreed with him\n      that in the insane condition of civilization, which made the rearing of\n      citizens more costly and perilous than any other crime, it was inadvisable\n      to have children till he had made more money. She was sorry --  -- Perhaps\n      he had made all the mystery of love a mechanical cautiousness but --  -- She\n      fled from the thought with a dubious, \"Some day.\"",
                "Her \"reforms,\" her impulses toward beauty in raw Main Street, they had\n      become indistinct. But she would set them going now. She would! She swore\n      it with soft fist beating the edges of the radiator. And at the end of all\n      her vows she had no notion as to when and where the crusade was to begin.",
                "Become an authentic part of the town? She began to think with unpleasant\n      lucidity. She reflected that she did not know whether the people liked\n      her. She had gone to the women at afternoon-coffees, to the merchants in\n      their stores, with so many outpouring comments and whimsies that she\n      hadn't given them a chance to betray their opinions of her. The men smiled -- but\n      did they like her? She was lively among the women -- but was she one of\n      them? She could not recall many times when she had been admitted to the\n      whispering of scandal which is the secret chamber of Gopher Prairie\n      conversation.",
                "She was poisoned with doubt, as she drooped up to bed.",
                "Next day, through her shopping, her mind sat back and observed. Dave Dyer\n      and Sam Clark were as cordial as she had been fancying; but wasn't there\n      an impersonal abruptness in the \"H' are yuh?\" of Chet Dashaway? Howland\n      the grocer was curt. Was that merely his usual manner?",
                "\"It's infuriating to have to pay attention to what people think. In St.\n      Paul I didn't care. But here I'm spied on. They're watching me. I mustn't\n      let it make me self-conscious,\" she coaxed herself -- overstimulated by\n      the drug of thought, and offensively on the defensive.",
                "III",
                "A thaw which stripped the snow from the sidewalks; a ringing iron night\n      when the lakes could be heard booming; a clear roistering morning. In tam\n      o'shanter and tweed skirt Carol felt herself a college junior going out to\n      play hockey. She wanted to whoop, her legs ached to run. On the way home\n      from shopping she yielded, as a pup would have yielded. She galloped down\n      a block and as she jumped from a curb across a welter of slush, she gave a\n      student \"Yippee!\"",
                "She saw that in a window three old women were gasping. Their triple glare\n      was paralyzing. Across the street, at another window, the curtain had\n      secretively moved. She stopped, walked on sedately, changed from the girl\n      Carol into Mrs. Dr. Kennicott.",

To belong to it was to be \"in.\" Though its membership partly\n      coincided with that of the Thanatopsis study club, the Jolly Seventeen as\n      a separate entity guffawed at the Thanatopsis, and considered it\n      middle-class and even \"highbrow.\"",
                "Most of the Jolly Seventeen were young married women, with their husbands\n      as associate members. Once a week they had a women's afternoon-bridge;\n      once a month the husbands joined them for supper and evening-bridge; twice\n      a year they had dances at I. O. O. F. Hall. Then the town exploded. Only\n      at the annual balls of the Firemen and of the Eastern Star was there such\n      prodigality of chiffon scarfs and tangoing and heart-burnings, and these\n      rival institutions were not select -- hired girls attended the\n      Firemen's Ball, with section-hands and laborers. Ella Stowbody had once\n      gone to a Jolly Seventeen Soiree in the village hack, hitherto confined to\n      chief mourners at funerals; and Harry Haydock and Dr. Terry Gould always\n      appeared in the town's only specimens of evening clothes.",
                "The afternoon-bridge of the Jolly Seventeen which followed Carol's lonely\n      doubting was held at Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow, with its\n      door of polished oak and beveled plate-glass, jar of ferns in the\n      plastered hall, and in the living-room, a fumed oak Morris chair, sixteen\n      color-prints, and a square varnished table with a mat made of\n      cigar-ribbons on which was one Illustrated Gift Edition and one pack of\n      cards in a burnt-leather case.",
                "Carol stepped into a sirocco of furnace heat. They were already playing.\n      Despite her flabby resolves she had not yet learned bridge. She was\n      winningly apologetic about it to Juanita, and ashamed that she should have\n      to go on being apologetic.",
                "Mrs. Dave Dyer, a sallow woman with a thin prettiness devoted to\n      experiments in religious cults, illnesses, and scandal-bearing, shook her\n      finger at Carol and trilled, \"You're a naughty one! I don't believe you\n      appreciate the honor, when you got into the Jolly Seventeen so easy!\"",
                "Mrs. Chet Dashaway nudged her neighbor at the second table. But Carol kept\n      up the appealing bridal manner so far as possible. She twittered, \"You're\n      perfectly right. I'm a lazy thing. I'll make Will start teaching me this\n      very evening.\" Her supplication had all the sound of birdies in the nest,\n      and Easter church-bells, and frosted Christmas cards. Internally she\n      snarled, \"That ought to be saccharine enough.\" She sat in the smallest\n      rocking-chair, a model of Victorian modesty. But she saw or she imagined\n      that the women who had gurgled at her so welcomingly when she had first\n      come to Gopher Prairie were nodding at her brusquely.",
                "During the pause after the first game she petitioned Mrs. Jackson Elder,\n      \"Don't you think we ought to get up another bob-sled party soon?\"",
                "\"It's so cold when you get dumped in the snow,\" said Mrs. Elder,\n      indifferently.",
                "\"I hate snow down my neck,\" volunteered Mrs. Dave Dyer, with an unpleasant\n      look at Carol and, turning her back, she bubbled at Rita Simons, \"Dearie,\n      won't you run in this evening? I've got the loveliest new Butterick\n      pattern I want to show you.\"",
                "Carol crept back to her chair. In the fervor of discussing the game they\n      ignored her. She was not used to being a wallflower. She struggled to keep\n      from oversensitiveness, from becoming unpopular by the sure method of\n      believing that she was unpopular; but she hadn't much reserve of patience,\n      and at the end of the second game, when Ella Stowbody sniffily asked her,\n      \"Are you going to send to Minneapolis for your dress for the next soiree -- heard\n      you were,\" Carol said \"Don't know yet\" with unnecessary sharpness.",
                "She was relieved by the admiration with which the jeune fille Rita Simons\n      looked at the steel buckles on her pumps; but she resented Mrs. Howland's\n      tart demand, \"Don't you find that new couch of yours is too broad to be\n      practical?\" She nodded, then shook her head, and touchily left Mrs.\n      Howland to get out of it any meaning she desired. Immediately she wanted\n      to make peace. She was close to simpering in the sweetness with which she\n      addressed Mrs Howland: \"I think that is the prettiest display of beef-tea\n      your husband has in his store.\"",
                "\"Oh yes, Gopher Prairie isn't so much behind the times,\" gibed Mrs.\n      Howland. Some one giggled.",
                "Their rebuffs made her haughty; her haughtiness irritated them to franker\n      rebuffs; they were working up to a state of painfully righteous war when\n      they were saved by the coming of food.",
                "Though Juanita Haydock was highly advanced in the matters of finger-bowls,\n      doilies, and bath-mats, her \"refreshments\" were typical of all the\n      afternoon-coffees. Juanita's best friends, Mrs. Dyer and Mrs. Dashaway,\n      passed large dinner plates, each with a spoon, a fork, and a coffee cup\n      without saucer. They apologized and discussed the afternoon's game as they\n      passed through the thicket of women's feet. Then they distributed hot\n      buttered rolls, coffee poured from an enamel-ware pot, stuffed olives,\n      potato salad, and angel's-food cake. There was, even in the most strictly\n      conforming Gopher Prairie circles, a certain option as to collations. The\n      olives need not be stuffed. Doughnuts were in some houses well thought of\n      as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls. But there was in all the town\n      no heretic save Carol who omitted angel's-food.",
                "They ate enormously. Carol had a suspicion that the thriftier housewives\n      made the afternoon treat do for evening supper.",
                "She tried to get back into the current. She edged over to Mrs. McGanum.\n      Chunky, amiable, young Mrs. McGanum with her breast and arms of a\n      milkmaid, and her loud delayed laugh which burst startlingly from a sober\n      face, was the daughter of old Dr. Westlake, and the wife of Westlake's\n      partner, Dr. McGanum. Kennicott asserted that Westlake and McGanum and\n      their contaminated families were tricky, but Carol had found them\n      gracious. She asked for friendliness by crying to Mrs. McGanum, \"How is\n      the baby's throat now?\" and she was attentive while Mrs. McGanum rocked\n      and knitted and placidly described symptoms.",
                "Vida Sherwin came in after school, with Miss Ethel Villets, the town\n      librarian. Miss Sherwin's optimistic presence gave Carol more confidence.\n      She talked. She informed the circle \"I drove almost down to Wahkeenyan\n      with Will, a few days ago. Isn't the country lovely! And I do admire the\n      Scandinavian farmers down there so: their big red barns and silos and\n      milking-machines and everything. Do you all know that lonely Lutheran\n      church, with the tin-covered spire, that stands out alone on a hill? It's\n      so bleak; somehow it seems so brave. I do think the Scandinavians are the\n      hardiest and best people --  -- \"",
                "\"Oh, do you THINK so?\" protested Mrs. Jackson Elder. \"My husband says the\n      Svenskas that work in the planing-mill are perfectly terrible -- so\n      silent and cranky, and so selfish, the way they keep demanding raises. If\n      they had their way they'd simply ruin the business.\"",
                "\"Yes, and they're simply GHASTLY hired girls!\" wailed Mrs. Dave Dyer. \"I\n      swear, I work myself to skin and bone trying to please my hired girls -- when\n      I can get them! I do everything in the world for them. They can have their\n      gentleman friends call on them in the kitchen any time, and they get just\n      the same to eat as we do, if there's, any left over, and I practically\n      never jump on them.\"",
                "Juanita Haydock rattled, \"They're ungrateful, all that class of people. I\n      do think the domestic problem is simply becoming awful. I don't know what\n      the country's coming to, with these Scandahoofian clodhoppers demanding\n      every cent you can save, and so ignorant and impertinent, and on my word,\n      demanding bath-tubs and everything -- as if they weren't mighty good\n      and lucky at home if they got a bath in the wash-tub.\"",
                "They were off, riding hard. Carol thought of Bea and waylaid them:",
                "\"But isn't it possibly the fault of the mistresses if the maids are\n      ungrateful? For generations we've given them the leavings of food, and\n      holes to live in.

I always make them\n      pack and unpack their trunks down-stairs, right under my eyes, and then I\n      know they aren't being tempted to dishonesty by any slackness on MY part!\"",
                "\"How much do the maids get here?\" Carol ventured.",
                "Mrs. B. J. Gougerling, wife of the banker, stated in a shocked manner,\n      \"Any place from three-fifty to five-fifty a week!

Whether she entered a\n      store, or swept the back porch, or stood at the bay-window in the\n      living-room, the village peeped at her. Once she had swung along the\n      street triumphant in making a home. Now she glanced at each house, and\n      felt, when she was safely home, that she had won past a thousand enemies\n      armed with ridicule. She told herself that her sensitiveness was\n      preposterous, but daily she was thrown into panic. She saw curtains slide\n      back into innocent smoothness. Old women who had been entering their\n      houses slipped out again to stare at her -- in the wintry quiet she\n      could hear them tiptoeing on their porches. When she had for a blessed\n      hour forgotten the searchlight, when she was scampering through a chill\n      dusk, happy in yellow windows against gray night, her heart checked as she\n      realized that a head covered with a shawl was thrust up over a snow-tipped\n      bush to watch her.",

She knew that she read\n      mockery into greetings but she could not control her suspicion, could not\n      rise from her psychic collapse. She alternately raged and flinched at the\n      superiority of the merchants. They did not know that they were being rude,\n      but they meant to have it understood that they were prosperous and \"not\n      scared of no doctor's wife.\" They often said, \"One man's as good as\n      another -- and a darn sight better.\" This motto, however, they did not\n      commend to farmer customers who had had crop failures. The Yankee\n      merchants were crabbed; and Ole Jenson, Ludelmeyer, and Gus Dahl, from the\n      \"Old Country,\" wished to be taken for Yankees. James Madison Howland, born\n      in New Hampshire, and Ole Jenson, born in Sweden, both proved that they\n      were free American citizens by grunting, \"I don't know whether I got any\n      or not,\" or \"Well, you can't expect me to get it delivered by noon.\"",

                "Axel was not respectable and rude. He was still a foreigner, and he\n      expected to remain one. His manner was heavy and uninterrogative. His\n      establishment was more fantastic than any cross-roads store. No one save\n      Axel himself could find anything. A part of the assortment of children's\n      stockings was under a blanket on a shelf, a part in a tin ginger-snap box,\n      the rest heaped like a nest of black-cotton snakes upon a flour-barrel\n      which was surrounded by brooms, Norwegian Bibles, dried cod for ludfisk,\n      boxes of apricots, and a pair and a half of lumbermen's rubber-footed\n      boots. The place was crowded with Scandinavian farmwives, standing aloof\n      in shawls and ancient fawn-colored leg o' mutton jackets, awaiting the\n      return of their lords. They spoke Norwegian or Swedish, and looked at\n      Carol uncomprehendingly. They were a relief to her -- they were not\n      whispering that she was a poseur.",

It was a smart suit with\n      lines unfamiliar to the dragging yellow and pink frocks of the town. The\n      Widow Bogart's stare, from her porch, indicated, \"Well I never saw\n      anything like that before!\" Mrs. McGanum stopped Carol at the notions shop\n      to hint, \"My, that's a nice suit -- wasn't it terribly expensive?\" The\n      gang of boys in front of the drug store commented, \"Hey, Pudgie, play you\n      a game of checkers on that dress.\" Carol could not endure it.

She heard them smacking moist lips\n      over every love-scene at the Rosebud Movie Palace. At the counter of the\n      Greek Confectionery Parlor, while they ate dreadful messes of decayed\n      bananas, acid cherries, whipped cream, and gelatinous ice-cream, they\n      screamed to one another, \"Hey, lemme 'lone,\" \"Quit dog-gone you, looka\n      what you went and done, you almost spilled my glass swater,\" \"Like hell I\n      did,\" \"Hey, gol darn your hide, don't you go sticking your coffin nail in\n      my i-scream,\" \"Oh you Batty, how juh like dancing with Tillie McGuire,\n      last night?

She had taken this for granted. She had studied\n      the boys pityingly, but impersonally. It had not occurred to her that they\n      might touch her.",

No schoolgirl passed their\n      observation-posts more flushingly than did Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. In shame\n      she knew that they glanced appraisingly at her snowy overshoes,\n      speculating about her legs. Theirs were not young eyes -- there was no\n      youth in all the town, she agonized. They were born old, grim and old and\n      spying and censorious.",
                "She cried again that their youth was senile and cruel on the day when she\n      overheard Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock.",
                "Cyrus N. Bogart, son of the righteous widow who lived across the alley,\n      was at this time a boy of fourteen or fifteen. Carol had already seen\n      quite enough of Cy Bogart. On her first evening in Gopher Prairie Cy had\n      appeared at the head of a \"charivari,\" banging immensely upon a discarded\n      automobile fender. His companions were yelping in imitation of coyotes.\n      Kennicott had felt rather complimented; had gone out and distributed a\n      dollar. But Cy was a capitalist in charivaris. He returned with an\n      entirely new group, and this time there were three automobile fenders and\n      a carnival rattle. When Kennicott again interrupted his shaving, Cy piped,\n      \"Naw, you got to give us two dollars,\" and he got it. A week later Cy\n      rigged a tic-tac to a window of the living-room, and the tattoo out of the\n      darkness frightened Carol into screaming. Since then, in four months, she\n      had beheld Cy hanging a cat, stealing melons, throwing tomatoes at the\n      Kennicott house, and making ski-tracks across the lawn, and had heard him\n      explaining the mysteries of generation, with great audibility and\n      dismaying knowledge. He was, in fact, a museum specimen of what a small\n      town, a well-disciplined public school, a tradition of hearty humor, and a\n      pious mother could produce from the material of a courageous and ingenious\n      mind.",

Above it was a loft which Cy Bogart\n      and Earl Haydock, young brother of Harry, used as a den, for smoking,\n      hiding from whippings, and planning secret societies.

The zest of winter was gone. Three months more, till May, the\n      cold might drag on, with the snow ever filthier, the weakened body less\n      resistent.

In a shack of\n      thin boards covered with tar-paper she saw the washerwoman, Mrs. Steinhof,\n      working in gray steam. Outside, her six-year-old boy chopped wood. He had\n      a torn jacket, muffler of a blue like skimmed milk. His hands were covered\n      with red mittens through which protruded his chapped raw knuckles.

                "Her enthusiasm had become watery even before thirteen women resolutely\n      removed their overshoes, sat down meatily, ate peppermints, dusted their\n      fingers, folded their hands, composed their lower thoughts, and invited\n      the naked muse of poetry to deliver her most improving message. They had\n      greeted Carol affectionately, and she tried to be a daughter to them. But\n      she felt insecure. Her chair was out in the open, exposed to their gaze,\n      and it was a hard-slatted, quivery, slippery church-parlor chair, likely\n      to collapse publicly and without warning. It was impossible to sit on it\n      without folding the hands and listening piously.",

                "Mrs. Ole Jenson said that Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died 1616. He\n      lived in London, England, and in Stratford-on-Avon, which many American\n      tourists loved to visit, a lovely town with many curios and old houses\n      well worth examination. Many people believed that Shakespeare was the\n      greatest play-wright who ever lived, also a fine poet. Not much was known\n      about his life, but after all that did not really make so much difference,\n      because they loved to read his numerous plays, several of the best known\n      of which she would now criticize.",
                "Perhaps the best known of his plays was \"The Merchant of Venice,\" having a\n      beautiful love story and a fine appreciation of a woman's brains, which a\n      woman's club, even those who did not care to commit themselves on the\n      question of suffrage, ought to appreciate. (Laughter.) Mrs. Jenson was\n      sure that she, for one, would love to be like Portia. The play was about a\n      Jew named Shylock, and he didn't want his daughter to marry a Venice\n      gentleman named Antonio --  --",

Burns had to work hard\n      and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low habits. But it is\n      morally instructive to know that he was a good student and educated\n      himself, in striking contrast to the loose ways and so-called aristocratic\n      society-life of Lord Byron, on which I have just spoken. And certainly\n      though the lords and earls of his day may have looked down upon Burns as a\n      humble person, many of us have greatly enjoyed his pieces about the mouse\n      and other rustic subjects, with their message of humble beauty -- I am\n      so sorry I have not got the time to quote some of them.\"",

She found it a liver-colored frame coop half a\n      block from Main Street. The front was an unrelieved wall of clapboards and\n      dirty windows. It had an unobstructed view of a vacant lot and Nat Hicks's\n      tailor shop. It was larger than the carpenter shop beside it, but not so\n      well built.",
                "No one was about. She walked into the corridor. On one side was the\n      municipal court, like a country school; on the other, the room of the\n      volunteer fire company, with a Ford hose-cart and the ornamental helmets\n      used in parades, at the end of the hall, a filthy two-cell jail, now empty\n      but smelling of ammonia and ancient sweat. The whole second story was a\n      large unfinished room littered with piles of folding chairs, a\n      lime-crusted mortar-mixing box, and the skeletons of Fourth of July floats\n      covered with decomposing plaster shields and faded red, white, and blue\n      bunting.

                "She berated herself, \"Stop this fever of reforming everything! I WILL be\n      satisfied with the library! The city hall is enough for a beginning. And\n      it's really an excellent library. It's -- it isn't so bad. . . . Is it\n      possible that I am to find dishonesties and stupidity in every human\n      activity I encounter?

                "She shook her head as though she were shaking off water, and hastened into\n      the library, a young, light, amiable presence, modest in unbuttoned fur\n      coat, blue suit, fresh organdy collar, and tan boots roughened from\n      scuffling snow. Miss Villets stared at her, and Carol purred, \"I was so\n      sorry not to see you at the Thanatopsis yesterday. Vida said you might\n      come.\"",

I'm sure what I say doesn't\n      matter a bit!\"",
                "\"You're much too modest, and I'm going to tell Vida so, and, uh, I wonder\n      if you can give me just a teeny bit of your time and show me where the\n      magazine files are kept?\"",

The Arab\n      village of Djeddah -- an intricately chased jewel-box. A town in\n      California which had changed itself from the barren brick fronts and\n      slatternly frame sheds of a Main Street to a way which led the eye down a\n      vista of arcades and gardens.",
                "Assured that she was not quite mad in her belief that a small American\n      town might be lovely, as well as useful in buying wheat and selling plows,\n      she sat brooding, her thin fingers playing a tattoo on her cheeks. She saw\n      in Gopher Prairie a Georgian city hall: warm brick walls with white\n      shutters, a fanlight, a wide hall and curving stair. She saw it the common\n      home and inspiration not only of the town but of the country about. It\n      should contain the court-room (she couldn't get herself to put in a jail),\n      public library, a collection of excellent prints, rest-room and model\n      kitchen for farmwives, theater, lecture room, free community ballroom,\n      farm-bureau, gymnasium. Forming about it and influenced by it, as\n      mediaeval villages gathered about the castle, she saw a new Georgian town\n      as graceful and beloved as Annapolis or that bowery Alexandria to which\n      Washington rode.",
                "All this the Thanatopsis Club was to accomplish with no difficulty\n      whatever, since its several husbands were the controllers of business and\n      politics. She was proud of herself for this practical view.",
                "She had taken only half an hour to change a wire-fenced potato-plot into a\n      walled rose-garden. She hurried out to apprize Mrs. Leonard Warren, as\n      president of the Thanatopsis, of the miracle which had been worked.",
                "III",
                "At a quarter to three Carol had left home; at half-past four she had\n      created the Georgian town; at a quarter to five she was in the dignified\n      poverty of the Congregational parsonage, her enthusiasm pattering upon\n      Mrs. Leonard Warren like summer rain upon an old gray roof; at two minutes\n      to five a town of demure courtyards and welcoming dormer windows had been\n      erected, and at two minutes past five the entire town was as flat as\n      Babylon.",
                "Erect in a black William and Mary chair against gray and speckly-brown\n      volumes of sermons and Biblical commentaries and Palestine geographies\n      upon long pine shelves, her neat black shoes firm on a rag-rug, herself as\n      correct and low-toned as her background, Mrs. Warren listened without\n      comment till Carol was quite through, then answered delicately:",
                "\"Yes, I think you draw a very nice picture of what might easily come to\n      pass -- some day. I have no doubt that such villages will be found on\n      the prairie -- some day. But if I might make just the least little\n      criticism: it seems to me that you are wrong in supposing either that the\n      city hall would be the proper start, or that the Thanatopsis would be the\n      right instrument. After all, it's the churches, isn't it, that are the\n      real heart of the community. As you may possibly know, my husband is\n      prominent in Congregational circles all through the state for his advocacy\n      of church-union. He hopes to see all the evangelical denominations joined\n      in one strong body, opposing Catholicism and Christian Science, and\n      properly guiding all movements that make for morality and prohibition.\n      Here, the combined churches could afford a splendid club-house, maybe a\n      stucco and half-timber building with gargoyles and all sorts of pleasing\n      decorations on it, which, it seems to me, would be lots better to impress\n      the ordinary class of people than just a plain old-fashioned colonial\n      house, such as you describe. And that would be the proper center for all\n      educational and pleasurable activities, instead of letting them fall into\n      the hands of the politicians.\"",
                "\"I don't suppose it will take more than thirty or forty years for the\n      churches to get together?\" Carol said innocently.",

                "Carol did not recover her zeal till two days after, when she tried Mrs.\n      George Edwin Mott, wife of the superintendent of schools.",
                "Mrs. Mott commented, \"Personally, I am terribly busy with dressmaking and\n      having the seamstress in the house and all, but it would be splendid to\n      have the other members of the Thanatopsis take up the question. Except for\n      one thing: First and foremost, we must have a new schoolbuilding. Mr. Mott\n      says they are terribly cramped.\"",
                "Carol went to view the old building. The grades and the high school were\n      combined in a damp yellow-brick structure with the narrow windows of an\n      antiquated jail -- a hulk which expressed hatred and compulsory\n      training. She conceded Mrs. Mott's demand so violently that for two days\n      she dropped her own campaign. Then she built the school and city hall\n      together, as the center of the reborn town.",
                "She ventured to the lead-colored dwelling of Mrs. Dave Dyer. Behind the\n      mask of winter-stripped vines and a wide porch only a foot above the\n      ground, the cottage was so impersonal that Carol could never visualize it.\n      Nor could she remember anything that was inside it. But Mrs. Dyer was\n      personal enough. With Carol, Mrs. Howland, Mrs. McGanum, and Vida Sherwin\n      she was a link between the Jolly Seventeen and the serious Thanatopsis (in\n      contrast to Juanita Haydock, who unnecessarily boasted of being a\n      \"lowbrow\" and publicly stated that she would \"see herself in jail before\n      she'd write any darned old club papers\"). Mrs. Dyer was superfeminine in\n      the kimono in which she received Carol. Her skin was fine, pale, soft,\n      suggesting a weak voluptuousness. At afternoon-coffees she had been rude\n      but now she addressed Carol as \"dear,\" and insisted on being called Maud.\n      Carol did not quite know why she was uncomfortable in this talcum-powder\n      atmosphere, but she hastened to get into the fresh air of her plans.",
                "Maud Dyer granted that the city hall wasn't \"so very nice,\" yet, as Dave\n      said, there was no use doing anything about it till they received an\n      appropriation from the state and combined a new city hall with a national\n      guard armory. Dave had given verdict, \"What these mouthy youngsters that\n      hang around the pool-room need is universal military training. Make men of\n      'em.\"",
                "Mrs. Dyer removed the new schoolbuilding from the city hall:",
                "\"Oh, so Mrs. Mott has got you going on her school craze! She's been\n      dinging at that till everybody's sick and tired. What she really wants is\n      a big office for her dear bald-headed Gawge to sit around and look\n      important in. Of course I admire Mrs. Mott, and I'm very fond of her,\n      she's so brainy, even if she does try to butt in and run the Thanatopsis,\n      but I must say we're sick of her nagging. The old building was good enough\n      for us when we were kids! I hate these would-be women politicians, don't\n      you?\"",
                "IV",
                "The first week of March had given promise of spring and stirred Carol with\n      a thousand desires for lakes and fields and roads. The snow was gone\n      except for filthy woolly patches under trees, the thermometer leaped in a\n      day from wind-bitten chill to itchy warmth. As soon as Carol was convinced\n      that even in this imprisoned North, spring could exist again, the snow\n      came down as abruptly as a paper storm in a theater; the northwest gale\n      flung it up in a half blizzard; and with her hope of a glorified town went\n      hope of summer meadows.",
                "But a week later, though the snow was everywhere in slushy heaps, the\n      promise was unmistakable. By the invisible hints in air and sky and earth\n      which had aroused her every year through ten thousand generations she knew\n      that spring was coming. It was not a scorching, hard, dusty day like the\n      treacherous intruder of a week before, but soaked with languor, softened\n      with a milky light. Rivulets were hurrying in each alley; a calling robin\n      appeared by magic on the crab-apple tree in the Howlands' yard. Everybody\n      chuckled, \"Looks like winter is going,\" and \"This 'll bring the frost out\n      of the roads -- have the autos out pretty soon now -- wonder what\n      kind of bass-fishing we'll get this summer -- ought to be good crops\n      this year.\"",
                "Each evening Kennicott repeated, \"We better not take off our Heavy\n      Underwear or the storm windows too soon -- might be 'nother spell of\n      cold -- got to be careful 'bout catching cold -- wonder if the coal\n      will last through?\"",
                "The expanding forces of life within her choked the desire for reforming.\n      She trotted through the house, planning the spring cleaning with Bea. When\n      she attended her second meeting of the Thanatopsis she said nothing about\n      remaking the town. She listened respectably to statistics on Dickens,\n      Thackeray, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Scott, Hardy, Lamb, De Quincey, and\n      Mrs. Humphry Ward, who, it seemed, constituted the writers of English\n      Fiction and Essays.",
                "Not till she inspected the rest-room did she again become a fanatic. She\n      had often glanced at the store-building which had been turned into a\n      refuge in which farmwives could wait while their husbands transacted\n      business. She had heard Vida Sherwin and Mrs. Warren caress the virtue of\n      the Thanatopsis in establishing the rest-room and in sharing with the city\n      council the expense of maintaining it. But she had never entered it till\n      this March day.",
                "She went in impulsively; nodded at the matron, a plump worthy widow named\n      Nodelquist, and at a couple of farm-women who were meekly rocking. The\n      rest-room resembled a second-hand store. It was furnished with discarded\n      patent rockers, lopsided reed chairs, a scratched pine table, a gritty\n      straw mat, old steel engravings of milkmaids being morally amorous under\n      willow-trees, faded chromos of roses and fish, and a kerosene stove for\n      warming lunches. The front window was darkened by torn net curtains and by\n      a mound of geraniums and rubber-plants.",
                "While she was listening to Mrs. Nodelquist's account of how many thousands\n      of farmers' wives used the rest-room every year, and how much they\n      \"appreciated the kindness of the ladies in providing them with this lovely\n      place, and all free,\" she thought, \"Kindness nothing! The kind-ladies'\n      husbands get the farmers' trade. This is mere commercial accommodation.\n      And it's horrible. It ought to be the most charming room in town, to\n      comfort women sick of prairie kitchens. Certainly it ought to have a clear\n      window, so that they can see the metropolitan life go by. Some day I'm\n      going to make a better rest-room -- a club-room. Why! I've already\n      planned that as part of my Georgian town hall!\"",
                "So it chanced that she was plotting against the peace of the Thanatopsis\n      at her third meeting (which covered Scandinavian, Russian, and Polish\n      Literature, with remarks by Mrs. Leonard Warren on the sinful paganism of\n      the Russian so-called church). Even before the entrance of the coffee and\n      hot rolls Carol seized on Mrs. Champ Perry, the kind and ample-bosomed\n      pioneer woman who gave historic dignity to the modern matrons of the\n      Thanatopsis. She poured out her plans. Mrs. Perry nodded and stroked\n      Carol's hand, but at the end she sighed:",

But I'm afraid you're too tender-hearted. When Champ and I came\n      here we teamed-it with an ox-cart from Sauk Centre to Gopher Prairie, and\n      there was nothing here then but a stockade and a few soldiers and some log\n      cabins. When we wanted salt pork and gunpowder, we sent out a man on\n      horseback, and probably he was shot dead by the Injuns before he got back.\n      We ladies -- of course we were all farmers at first -- we didn't\n      expect any rest-room in those days.

Dancing isn't what it was, anyway.\n      We used to dance modest, and we had just as much fun as all these young\n      folks do now with their terrible Turkey Trots and hugging and all. But if\n      they must neglect the Lord's injunction that young girls ought to be\n      modest, then I guess they manage pretty well at the K. P. Hall and the\n      Oddfellows', even if some of tie lodges don't always welcome a lot of\n      these foreigners and hired help to all their dances. And I certainly don't\n      see any need of a farm-bureau or this domestic science demonstration you\n      talk about. In my day the boys learned to farm by honest sweating, and\n      every gal could cook, or her ma learned her how across her knee! Besides,\n      ain't there a county agent at Wakamin?

I guess if the Grand Old Book has\n      withstood the attacks of infidels for these two thousand years it is worth\n      our SLIGHT consideration!\"",
                "\"Oh, I didn't mean --  -- \" Carol begged. Inasmuch as she did mean,\n      it was hard to be extremely lucid. \"But I wish, instead of limiting\n      ourselves either to the Bible, or to anecdotes about the Brothers Adam's\n      wigs, which Culture Hints seems to regard as the significant point about\n      furniture, we could study some of the really stirring ideas that are\n      springing up today -- whether it's chemistry or anthropology or labor\n      problems -- the things that are going to mean so terribly much.\"",
                "Everybody cleared her polite throat.",
                "Madam Chairman inquired, \"Is there any other discussion? Will some one\n      make a motion to adopt the suggestion of Vida Sherwin -- to take up\n      Furnishings and China?\"",
                "It was adopted, unanimously.",
                "\"Checkmate!\" murmured Carol, as she held up her hand.",
                "Had she actually believed that she could plant a seed of liberalism in the\n      blank wall of mediocrity? How had she fallen into the folly of trying to\n      plant anything whatever in a wall so smooth and sun-glazed, and so\n      satisfying to the happy sleepers within?"

                "CHAPTER XII",
                "ONE week of authentic spring, one rare sweet week of May, one tranquil\n      moment between the blast of winter and the charge of summer. Daily Carol\n      walked from town into flashing country hysteric with new life.",
                "One enchanted hour when she returned to youth and a belief in the\n      possibility of beauty.",
                "She had walked northward toward the upper shore of Plover Lake, taking to\n      the railroad track, whose directness and dryness make it the natural\n      highway for pedestrians on the plains. She stepped from tie to tie, in\n      long strides. At each road-crossing she had to crawl over a cattle-guard\n      of sharpened timbers. She walked the rails, balancing with arms extended,\n      cautious heel before toe. As she lost balance her body bent over, her arms\n      revolved wildly, and when she toppled she laughed aloud.",
                "The thick grass beside the track, coarse and prickly with many burnings,\n      hid canary-yellow buttercups and the mauve petals and woolly sage-green\n      coats of the pasque flowers. The branches of the kinnikinic brush were red\n      and smooth as lacquer on a saki bowl.",
                "She ran down the gravelly embankment, smiled at children gathering flowers\n      in a little basket, thrust a handful of the soft pasque flowers into the\n      bosom of her white blouse. Fields of springing wheat drew her from the\n      straight propriety of the railroad and she crawled through the rusty\n      barbed-wire fence. She followed a furrow between low wheat blades and a\n      field of rye which showed silver lights as it flowed before the wind. She\n      found a pasture by the lake. So sprinkled was the pasture with rag-baby\n      blossoms and the cottony herb of Indian tobacco that it spread out like a\n      rare old Persian carpet of cream and rose and delicate green. Under her\n      feet the rough grass made a pleasant crunching. Sweet winds blew from the\n      sunny lake beside her, and small waves sputtered on the meadowy shore. She\n      leaped a tiny creek bowered in pussy-willow buds. She was nearing a\n      frivolous grove of birch and poplar and wild plum trees.",
                "The poplar foliage had the downiness of a Corot arbor; the green and\n      silver trunks were as candid as the birches, as slender and lustrous as\n      the limbs of a Pierrot. The cloudy white blossoms of the plum trees filled\n      the grove with a springtime mistiness which gave an illusion of distance.",
                "She ran into the wood, crying out for joy of freedom regained after\n      winter. Choke-cherry blossoms lured her from the outer sun-warmed spaces\n      to depths of green stillness, where a submarine light came through the\n      young leaves. She walked pensively along an abandoned road. She found a\n      moccasin-flower beside a lichen-covered log. At the end of the road she\n      saw the open acres -- dipping rolling fields bright with wheat.",
                "\"I believe! The woodland gods still live! And out there, the great land.\n      It's beautiful as the mountains. What do I care for Thanatopsises?\"",
                "She came out on the prairie, spacious under an arch of boldly cut clouds.\n      Small pools glittered. Above a marsh red-winged blackbirds chased a crow\n      in a swift melodrama of the air. On a hill was silhouetted a man following\n      a drag. His horse bent its neck and plodded, content.",
                "A path took her to the Corinth road, leading back to town. Dandelions\n      glowed in patches amidst the wild grass by the way. A stream golloped\n      through a concrete culvert beneath the road. She trudged in healthy\n      weariness.",
                "A man in a bumping Ford rattled up beside her, hailed, \"Give you a lift,\n      Mrs. Kennicott?\"",
                "\"Thank you. It's awfully good of you, but I'm enjoying the walk.\"",
                "\"Great day, by golly. I seen some wheat that must of been five inches\n      high. Well, so long.\"",
                "She hadn't the dimmest notion who he was, but his greeting warmed her.\n      This countryman gave her a companionship which she had never (whether by\n      her fault or theirs or neither) been able to find in the matrons and\n      commercial lords of the town.",
                "Half a mile from town, in a hollow between hazelnut bushes and a brook,\n      she discovered a gipsy encampment: a covered wagon, a tent, a bunch of\n      pegged-out horses. A broad-shouldered man was squatted on his heels,\n      holding a frying-pan over a camp-fire. He looked toward her. He was Miles\n      Bjornstam.",
                "\"Well, well, what you doing out here?\" he roared. \"Come have a hunk o'\n      bacon. Pete! Hey, Pete!\"",
                "A tousled person came from behind the covered wagon.",
                "\"Pete, here's the one honest-to-God lady in my bum town. Come on, crawl in\n      and set a couple minutes, Mrs. Kennicott. I'm hiking off for all summer.\"",
                "The Red Swede staggered up, rubbed his cramped knees, lumbered to the wire\n      fence, held the strands apart for her. She unconsciously smiled at him as\n      she went through. Her skirt caught on a barb; he carefully freed it.",
                "Beside this man in blue flannel shirt, baggy khaki trousers, uneven\n      suspenders, and vile felt hat, she was small and exquisite.",
                "The surly Pete set out an upturned bucket for her. She lounged on it, her\n      elbows on her knees. \"Where are you going?\" she asked.",
                "\"Just starting off for the summer, horse-trading.\" Bjornstam chuckled. His\n      red mustache caught the sun. \"Regular hoboes and public benefactors we\n      are. Take a hike like this every once in a while. Sharks on horses. Buy\n      'em from farmers and sell 'em to others. We're honest -- frequently.\n      Great time. Camp along the road. I was wishing I had a chance to say\n      good-by to you before I ducked out but --  -- Say, you better come\n      along with us.\"",
                "\"I'd like to.\"",
                "\"While you're playing mumblety-peg with Mrs. Lym Cass, Pete and me will be\n      rambling across Dakota, through the Bad Lands, into the butte country, and\n      when fall comes, we'll be crossing over a pass of the Big Horn Mountains,\n      maybe, and camp in a snow-storm, quarter of a mile right straight up above\n      a lake. Then in the morning we'll lie snug in our blankets and look up\n      through the pines at an eagle. How'd it strike you? Heh? Eagle soaring and\n      soaring all day -- big wide sky --  -- \"",
                "\"Don't! Or I will go with you, and I'm afraid there might be some slight\n      scandal. Perhaps some day I'll do it. Good-by.\"",
                "Her hand disappeared in his blackened leather glove. From the turn in the\n      road she waved at him. She walked on more soberly now, and she was lonely.",
                "But the wheat and grass were sleek velvet under the sunset; the prairie\n      clouds were tawny gold; and she swung happily into Main Street.",
                "II",
                "Through the first days of June she drove with Kennicott on his calls. She\n      identified him with the virile land; she admired him as she saw with what\n      respect the farmers obeyed him. She was out in the early chill, after a\n      hasty cup of coffee, reaching open country as the fresh sun came up in\n      that unspoiled world. Meadow larks called from the tops of thin split\n      fence-posts. The wild roses smelled clean.",
                "As they returned in late afternoon the low sun was a solemnity of radial\n      bands, like a heavenly fan of beaten gold; the limitless circle of the\n      grain was a green sea rimmed with fog, and the willow wind-breaks were\n      palmy isles.",
                "Before July the close heat blanketed them. The tortured earth cracked.\n      Farmers panted through corn-fields behind cultivators and the sweating\n      flanks of horses. While she waited for Kennicott in the car, before a\n      farmhouse, the seat burned her fingers and her head ached with the glare\n      on fenders and hood.",
                "A black thunder-shower was followed by a dust storm which turned the sky\n      yellow with the hint of a coming tornado. Impalpable black dust far-borne\n      from Dakota covered the inner sills of the closed windows.",
                "The July heat was ever more stifling. They crawled along Main Street by\n      day; they found it hard to sleep at night. They brought mattresses down to\n      the living-room, and thrashed and turned by the open window. Ten times a\n      night they talked of going out to soak themselves with the hose and wade\n      through the dew, but they were too listless to take the trouble. On cool\n      evenings, when they tried to go walking, the gnats appeared in swarms\n      which peppered their faces and caught in their throats.",
                "She wanted the Northern pines, the Eastern sea, but Kennicott declared\n      that it would be \"kind of hard to get away, just NOW.\" The Health and\n      Improvement Committee of the Thanatopsis asked her to take part in the\n      anti-fly campaign, and she toiled about town persuading householders to\n      use the fly-traps furnished by the club, or giving out money prizes to\n      fly-swatting children. She was loyal enough but not ardent, and without\n      ever quite intending to, she began to neglect the task as heat sucked at\n      her strength.",
                "Kennicott and she motored North and spent a week with his mother -- that\n      is, Carol spent it with his mother, while he fished for bass.",
                "The great event was their purchase of a summer cottage, down on Lake\n      Minniemashie.",
                "Perhaps the most amiable feature of life in Gopher Prairie was the summer\n      cottages. They were merely two-room shanties, with a seepage of\n      broken-down chairs, peeling veneered tables, chromos pasted on wooden\n      walls, and inefficient kerosene stoves. They were so thin-walled and so\n      close together that you could -- and did -- hear a baby being\n      spanked in the fifth cottage off. But they were set among elms and lindens\n      on a bluff which looked across the lake to fields of ripened wheat sloping\n      up to green woods.",
                "Here the matrons forgot social jealousies, and sat gossiping in gingham;\n      or, in old bathing-suits, surrounded by hysterical children, they paddled\n      for hours. Carol joined them; she ducked shrieking small boys, and helped\n      babies construct sand-basins for unfortunate minnows. She liked Juanita\n      Haydock and Maud Dyer when she helped them make picnic-supper for the men,\n      who came motoring out from town each evening. She was easier and more\n      natural with them. In the debate as to whether there should be veal loaf\n      or poached egg on hash, she had no chance to be heretical and\n      oversensitive.",
                "They danced sometimes, in the evening; they had a minstrel show, with\n      Kennicott surprisingly good as end-man; always they were encircled by\n      children wise in the lore of woodchucks and gophers and rafts and willow\n      whistles.",
                "If they could have continued this normal barbaric life Carol would have\n      been the most enthusiastic citizen of Gopher Prairie. She was relieved to\n      be assured that she did not want bookish conversation alone; that she did\n      not expect the town to become a Bohemia. She was content now. She did not\n      criticize.",
                "But in September, when the year was at its richest, custom dictated that\n      it was time to return to town; to remove the children from the waste\n      occupation of learning the earth, and send them back to lessons about the\n      number of potatoes which (in a delightful world untroubled by\n      commission-houses or shortages in freight-cars) William sold to John. The\n      women who had cheerfully gone bathing all summer looked doubtful when\n      Carol begged, \"Let's keep up an outdoor life this winter, let's slide and\n      skate.\" Their hearts shut again till spring, and the nine months of\n      cliques and radiators and dainty refreshments began all over.",
                "III",
                "Carol had started a salon.",
                "Since Kennicott, Vida Sherwin, and Guy Pollock were her only lions, and\n      since Kennicott would have preferred Sam Clark to all the poets and\n      radicals in the entire world, her private and self-defensive clique did\n      not get beyond one evening dinner for Vida and Guy, on her first wedding\n      anniversary; and that dinner did not get beyond a controversy regarding\n      Raymie Wutherspoon's yearnings.",
                "Guy Pollock was the gentlest person she had found here. He spoke of her\n      new jade and cream frock naturally, not jocosely; he held her chair for\n      her as they sat down to dinner; and he did not, like Kennicott, interrupt\n      her to shout, \"Oh say, speaking of that, I heard a good story today.\" But\n      Guy was incurably hermit. He sat late and talked hard, and did not come\n      again.",
                "Then she met Champ Perry in the post-office -- and decided that in the\n      history of the pioneers was the panacea for Gopher Prairie, for all of\n      America. We have lost their sturdiness, she told herself. We must restore\n      the last of the veterans to power and follow them on the backward path to\n      the integrity of Lincoln, to the gaiety of settlers dancing in a saw-mill.",
                "She read in the records of the Minnesota Territorial Pioneers that only\n      sixty years ago, not so far back as the birth of her own father, four\n      cabins had composed Gopher Prairie. The log stockade which Mrs. Champ\n      Perry was to find when she trekked in was built afterward by the soldiers\n      as a defense against the Sioux. The four cabins were inhabited by Maine\n      Yankees who had come up the Mississippi to St. Paul and driven north over\n      virgin prairie into virgin woods. They ground their own corn; the\n      men-folks shot ducks and pigeons and prairie chickens; the new breakings\n      yielded the turnip-like rutabagas, which they ate raw and boiled and baked\n      and raw again. For treat they had wild plums and crab-apples and tiny wild\n      strawberries.",
                "Grasshoppers came darkening the sky, and in an hour ate the farmwife's\n      garden and the farmer's coat. Precious horses painfully brought from\n      Illinois, were drowned in bogs or stampeded by the fear of blizzards. Snow\n      blew through the chinks of new-made cabins, and Eastern children, with\n      flowery muslin dresses, shivered all winter and in summer were red and\n      black with mosquito bites. Indians were everywhere; they camped in\n      dooryards, stalked into kitchens to demand doughnuts, came with rifles\n      across their backs into schoolhouses and begged to see the pictures in the\n      geographies. Packs of timber-wolves treed the children; and the settlers\n      found dens of rattle-snakes, killed fifty, a hundred, in a day.",
                "Yet it was a buoyant life. Carol read enviously in the admirable Minnesota\n      chronicles called \"Old Rail Fence Corners\" the reminiscence of Mrs. Mahlon\n      Black, who settled in Stillwater in 1848:",
                "\"There was nothing to parade over in those days. We took it as it came and\n      had happy lives. . . . We would all gather together and in about two\n      minutes would be having a good time -- playing cards or dancing. . . .\n      We used to waltz and dance contra dances. None of these new jigs and not\n      wear any clothes to speak of. We covered our hides in those days; no tight\n      skirts like now. You could take three or four steps inside our skirts and\n      then not reach the edge. One of the boys would fiddle a while and then\n      some one would spell him and he could get a dance. Sometimes they would\n      dance and fiddle too.\"",
                "She reflected that if she could not have ballrooms of gray and rose and\n      crystal, she wanted to be swinging across a puncheon-floor with a dancing\n      fiddler. This smug in-between town, which had exchanged \"Money Musk\" for\n      phonographs grinding out ragtime, it was neither the heroic old nor the\n      sophisticated new. Couldn't she somehow, some yet unimagined how, turn it\n      back to simplicity?",
                "She herself knew two of the pioneers: the Perrys. Champ Perry was the\n      buyer at the grain-elevator. He weighed wagons of wheat on a rough\n      platform-scale, in the cracks of which the kernels sprouted every spring.\n      Between times he napped in the dusty peace of his office.",
                "She called on the Perrys at their rooms above Howland & Gould's\n      grocery.",
                "When they were already old they had lost the money, which they had\n      invested in an elevator. They had given up their beloved yellow brick\n      house and moved into these rooms over a store, which were the Gopher\n      Prairie equivalent of a flat. A broad stairway led from the street to the\n      upper hall, along which were the doors of a lawyer's office, a dentist's,\n      a photographer's \"studio,\" the lodge-rooms of the Affiliated Order of\n      Spartans and, at the back, the Perrys' apartment.",
                "They received her (their first caller in a month) with aged fluttering\n      tenderness. Mrs. Perry confided, \"My, it's a shame we got to entertain you\n      in such a cramped place. And there ain't any water except that ole iron\n      sink outside in the hall, but still, as I say to Champ, beggars can't be\n      choosers. 'Sides, the brick house was too big for me to sweep, and it was\n      way out, and it's nice to be living down here among folks. Yes, we're glad\n      to be here. But --  -- Some day, maybe we can have a house of our\n      own again. We're saving up --  -- Oh, dear, if we could have our own\n      home! But these rooms are real nice, ain't they!\"",
                "As old people will, the world over, they had moved as much as possible of\n      their familiar furniture into this small space. Carol had none of the\n      superiority she felt toward Mrs. Lyman Cass's plutocratic parlor. She was\n      at home here. She noted with tenderness all the makeshifts: the darned\n      chair-arms, the patent rocker covered with sleazy cretonne, the pasted\n      strips of paper mending the birch-bark napkin-rings labeled \"Papa\" and\n      \"Mama.\"",
                "She hinted of her new enthusiasm. To find one of the \"young folks\" who\n      took them seriously, heartened the Perrys, and she easily drew from them\n      the principles by which Gopher Prairie should be born again -- should\n      again become amusing to live in.",
                "This was their philosophy complete . . . in the era of aeroplanes and\n      syndicalism:",
                "The Baptist Church (and, somewhat less, the Methodist, Congregational, and\n      Presbyterian Churches) is the perfect, the divinely ordained standard in\n      music, oratory, philanthropy, and ethics. \"We don't need all this\n      new-fangled science, or this terrible Higher Criticism that's ruining our\n      young men in colleges. What we need is to get back to the true Word of\n      God, and a good sound belief in hell, like we used to have it preached to\n      us.\"",

                "Carol had not dared to look into the farther room while she labored over\n      the supper of beer, rye bread, moist cornbeef and cabbage, set on the\n      kitchen table. The man in there was groaning. In her one glance she had\n      seen that his blue flannel shirt was open at a corded tobacco-brown neck,\n      the hollows of which were sprinkled with thin black and gray hairs. He was\n      covered with a sheet, like a corpse, and outside the sheet was his right\n      arm, wrapped in towels stained with blood.",
                "But Kennicott strode into the other room gaily, and she followed him. With\n      surprising delicacy in his large fingers he unwrapped the towels and\n      revealed an arm which, below the elbow, was a mass of blood and raw flesh.\n      The man bellowed. The room grew thick about her; she was very seasick; she\n      fled to a chair in the kitchen. Through the haze of nausea she heard\n      Kennicott grumbling, \"Afraid it will have to come off, Adolph. What did\n      you do? Fall on a reaper blade? We'll fix it right up. Carrie! CAROL!\"",
                "She couldn't -- she couldn't get up. Then she was up, her knees like\n      water, her stomach revolving a thousand times a second, her eyes filmed,\n      her ears full of roaring. She couldn't reach the dining-room. She was\n      going to faint. Then she was in the dining-room, leaning against the wall,\n      trying to smile, flushing hot and cold along her chest and sides, while\n      Kennicott mumbled, \"Say, help Mrs. Morgenroth and me carry him in on the\n      kitchen table. No, first go out and shove those two tables together, and\n      put a blanket on them and a clean sheet.\"",
                "It was salvation to push the heavy tables, to scrub them, to be exact in\n      placing the sheet. Her head cleared; she was able to look calmly in at her\n      husband and the farmwife while they undressed the wailing man, got him\n      into a clean nightgown, and washed his arm. Kennicott came to lay out his\n      instruments. She realized that, with no hospital facilities, yet with no\n      worry about it, her husband -- HER HUSBAND -- was going to perform a\n      surgical operation, that miraculous boldness of which one read in stories\n      about famous surgeons.",
                "She helped them to move Adolph into the kitchen. The man was in such a\n      funk that he would not use his legs. He was heavy, and smelled of sweat\n      and the stable. But she put her arm about his waist, her sleek head by his\n      chest; she tugged at him; she clicked her tongue in imitation of\n      Kennicott's cheerful noises.",
                "When Adolph was on the table Kennicott laid a hemispheric steel and cotton\n      frame on his face; suggested to Carol, \"Now you sit here at his head and\n      keep the ether dripping -- about this fast, see? I'll watch his\n      breathing. Look who's here! Real anesthetist! Ochsner hasn't got a better\n      one! Class, eh? . . . Now, now, Adolph, take it easy. This won't hurt you\n      a bit. Put you all nice and asleep and it won't hurt a bit. Schweig' mal!\n      Bald schlaft man grat wie ein Kind. So! So! Bald geht's besser!\"",
                "As she let the ether drip, nervously trying to keep the rhythm that\n      Kennicott had indicated, Carol stared at her husband with the abandon of\n      hero-worship.",
                "He shook his head. \"Bad light -- bad light. Here, Mrs. Morgenroth, you\n      stand right here and hold this lamp. Hier, und dieses -- dieses lamp\n      halten -- so!\"",
                "By that streaky glimmer he worked, swiftly, at ease. The room was still.\n      Carol tried to look at him, yet not look at the seeping blood, the crimson\n      slash, the vicious scalpel. The ether fumes were sweet, choking. Her head\n      seemed to be floating away from her body. Her arm was feeble.",
                "It was not the blood but the grating of the surgical saw on the living\n      bone that broke her, and she knew that she had been fighting off nausea,\n      that she was beaten. She was lost in dizziness. She heard Kennicott's\n      voice --",
                "\"Sick? Trot outdoors couple minutes. Adolph will stay under now.\"",
                "She was fumbling at a door-knob which whirled in insulting circles; she\n      was on the stoop, gasping, forcing air into her chest, her head clearing.\n      As she returned she caught the scene as a whole: the cavernous kitchen,\n      two milk-cans a leaden patch by the wall, hams dangling from a beam, bats\n      of light at the stove door, and in the center, illuminated by a small\n      glass lamp held by a frightened stout woman, Dr. Kennicott bending over a\n      body which was humped under a sheet -- the surgeon, his bare arms\n      daubed with blood, his hands, in pale-yellow rubber gloves, loosening the\n      tourniquet, his face without emotion save when he threw up his head and\n      clucked at the farmwife, \"Hold that light steady just a second more -- noch\n      blos esn wenig.\"",
                "\"He speaks a vulgar, common, incorrect German of life and death and birth\n      and the soil. I read the French and German of sentimental lovers and\n      Christmas garlands. And I thought that it was I who had the culture!\" she\n      worshiped as she returned to her place.",
                "After a time he snapped, \"That's enough. Don't give him any more ether.\"\n       He was concentrated on tying an artery. His gruffness seemed heroic to\n      her.",
                "As he shaped the flap of flesh she murmured, \"Oh, you ARE wonderful!\"",
                "He was surprised. \"Why, this is a cinch. Now if it had been like last week --  -- Get\n      me some more water. Now last week I had a case with an ooze in the\n      peritoneal cavity, and by golly if it wasn't a stomach ulcer that I hadn't\n      suspected and --  -- There. Say, I certainly am sleepy. Let's turn\n      in here. Too late to drive home. And tastes to me like a storm coming.\"",
                "IX",
                "They slept on a feather bed with their fur coats over them; in the morning\n      they broke ice in the pitcher -- the vast flowered and gilt pitcher.",
                "Kennicott's storm had not come. When they set out it was hazy and growing\n      warmer. After a mile she saw that he was studying a dark cloud in the\n      north. He urged the horses to the run. But she forgot his unusual haste in\n      wonder at the tragic landscape. The pale snow, the prickles of old\n      stubble, and the clumps of ragged brush faded into a gray obscurity. Under\n      the hillocks were cold shadows. The willows about a farmhouse were\n      agitated by the rising wind, and the patches of bare wood where the bark\n      had peeled away were white as the flesh of a leper. The snowy slews were\n      of a harsh flatness. The whole land was cruel, and a climbing cloud of\n      slate-edged blackness dominated the sky.",
                "\"Guess we're about in for a blizzard,\" speculated Kennicott \"We can make\n      Ben McGonegal's, anyway.\"",
                "\"Blizzard? Really? Why --  -- But still we used to think they were\n      fun when I was a girl. Daddy had to stay home from court, and we'd stand\n      at the window and watch the snow.\"",
                "\"Not much fun on the prairie. Get lost. Freeze to death. Take no chances.\"\n       He chirruped at the horses. They were flying now, the carriage rocking on\n      the hard ruts.",
                "The whole air suddenly crystallized into large damp flakes. The horses and\n      the buffalo robe were covered with snow; her face was wet; the thin butt\n      of the whip held a white ridge. The air became colder. The snowflakes were\n      harder; they shot in level lines, clawing at her face.",
                "She could not see a hundred feet ahead.",
                "Kennicott was stern. He bent forward, the reins firm in his coonskin\n      gauntlets. She was certain that he would get through. He always got\n      through things.",
                "Save for his presence, the world and all normal living disappeared. They\n      were lost in the boiling snow. He leaned close to bawl, \"Letting the\n      horses have their heads. They'll get us home.\"",
                "With a terrifying bump they were off the road, slanting with two wheels in\n      the ditch, but instantly they were jerked back as the horses fled on. She\n      gasped. She tried to, and did not, feel brave as she pulled the woolen\n      robe up about her chin.",
                "They were passing something like a dark wall on the right. \"I know that\n      barn!\" he yelped. He pulled at the reins. Peeping from the covers she saw\n      his teeth pinch his lower lip, saw him scowl as he slackened and sawed and\n      jerked sharply again at the racing horses.",
                "They stopped.",
                "\"Farmhouse there. Put robe around you and come on,\" he cried.",
                "It was like diving into icy water to climb out of the carriage, but on the\n      ground she smiled at him, her face little and childish and pink above the\n      buffalo robe over her shoulders. In a swirl of flakes which scratched at\n      their eyes like a maniac darkness, he unbuckled the harness. He turned and\n      plodded back, a ponderous furry figure, holding the horses' bridles,\n      Carol's hand dragging at his sleeve.",
                "They came to the cloudy bulk of a barn whose outer wall was directly upon\n      the road. Feeling along it, he found a gate, led them into a yard, into\n      the barn. The interior was warm. It stunned them with its languid quiet.",
                "He carefully drove the horses into stalls.",
                "Her toes were coals of pain. \"Let's run for the house,\" she said.",
                "\"Can't. Not yet. Might never find it. Might get lost ten feet away from\n      it. Sit over in this stall, near the horses. We'll rush for the house when\n      the blizzard lifts.\"",
                "\"I'm so stiff! I can't walk!\"",
                "He carried her into the stall, stripped off her overshoes and boots,\n      stopping to blow on his purple fingers as he fumbled at her laces. He\n      rubbed her feet, and covered her with the buffalo robe and horse-blankets\n      from the pile on the feed-box. She was drowsy, hemmed in by the storm. She\n      sighed:",
                "\"You're so strong and yet so skilful and not afraid of blood or storm or --  -- \"",
                "\"Used to it. Only thing that's bothered me was the chance the ether fumes\n      might explode, last night.\"",

                "\"Why, Dave, the darn fool, sent me ether, instead of chloroform like I\n      told him, and you know ether fumes are mighty inflammable, especially with\n      that lamp right by the table. But I had to operate, of course -- wound\n      chuck-full of barnyard filth that way.\"",

                "KENNICOTT was heavily pleased by her Christmas presents, and he gave her a\n      diamond bar-pin. But she could not persuade herself that he was much\n      interested in the rites of the morning, in the tree she had decorated, the\n      three stockings she had hung, the ribbons and gilt seals and hidden\n      messages. He said only:",
                "\"Nice way to fix things, all right. What do you say we go down to Jack\n      Elder's and have a game of five hundred this afternoon?\"",
                "She remembered her father's Christmas fantasies: the sacred old rag doll\n      at the top of the tree, the score of cheap presents, the punch and carols,\n      the roast chestnuts by the fire, and the gravity with which the judge\n      opened the children's scrawly notes and took cognizance of demands for\n      sled-rides, for opinions upon the existence of Santa Claus. She remembered\n      him reading out a long indictment of himself for being a sentimentalist,\n      against the peace and dignity of the State of Minnesota. She remembered\n      his thin legs twinkling before their sled --  --",
                "She muttered unsteadily, \"Must run up and put on my shoes -- slippers\n      so cold.\" In the not very romantic solitude of the locked bathroom she sat\n      on the slippery edge of the tub and wept.",
                "II",
                "Kennicott had five hobbies: medicine, land-investment, Carol, motoring,\n      and hunting. It is not certain in what order he preferred them. Solid\n      though his enthusiasms were in the matter of medicine -- his admiration\n      of this city surgeon, his condemnation of that for tricky ways of\n      persuading country practitioners to bring in surgical patients, his\n      indignation about fee-splitting, his pride in a new X-ray apparatus -- none\n      of these beatified him as did motoring.",
                "He nursed his two-year-old Buick even in winter, when it was stored in the\n      stable-garage behind the house. He filled the grease-cups, varnished a\n      fender, removed from beneath the back seat the debris of gloves, copper\n      washers, crumpled maps, dust, and greasy rags. Winter noons he wandered\n      out and stared owlishly at the car. He became excited over a fabulous\n      \"trip we might take next summer.\" He galloped to the station, brought home\n      railway maps, and traced motor-routes from Gopher Prairie to Winnipeg or\n      Des Moines or Grand Marais, thinking aloud and expecting her to be\n      effusive about such academic questions as \"Now I wonder if we could stop\n      at Baraboo and break the jump from La Crosse to Chicago?\"",
                "To him motoring was a faith not to be questioned, a high-church cult, with\n      electric sparks for candles, and piston-rings possessing the sanctity of\n      altar-vessels. His liturgy was composed of intoned and metrical\n      road-comments: \"They say there's a pretty good hike from Duluth to\n      International Falls.\"",
                "Hunting was equally a devotion, full of metaphysical concepts veiled from\n      Carol. All winter he read sporting-catalogues, and thought about\n      remarkable past shots: \"'Member that time when I got two ducks on a long\n      chance, just at sunset?\" At least once a month he drew his favorite\n      repeating shotgun, his \"pump gun,\" from its wrapper of greased canton\n      flannel; he oiled the trigger, and spent silent ecstatic moments aiming at\n      the ceiling. Sunday mornings Carol heard him trudging up to the attic and\n      there, an hour later, she found him turning over boots, wooden\n      duck-decoys, lunch-boxes, or reflectively squinting at old shells, rubbing\n      their brass caps with his sleeve and shaking his head as he thought about\n      their uselessness.",
                "He kept the loading-tools he had used as a boy: a capper for shot-gun\n      shells, a mold for lead bullets. When once, in a housewifely frenzy for\n      getting rid of things, she raged, \"Why don't you give these away?\" he\n      solemnly defended them, \"Well, you can't tell; they might come in handy\n      some day.\"",
                "She flushed. She wondered if he was thinking of the child they would have\n      when, as he put it, they were \"sure they could afford one.\"",
                "Mysteriously aching, nebulously sad, she slipped away, half-convinced but\n      only half-convinced that it was horrible and unnatural, this postponement\n      of release of mother-affection, this sacrifice to her opinionation and to\n      his cautious desire for prosperity.",
                "\"But it would be worse if he were like Sam Clark -- insisted on having\n      children,\" she considered; then, \"If Will were the Prince, wouldn't I\n      DEMAND his child?\"",
                "Kennicott's land-deals were both financial advancement and favorite game.\n      Driving through the country, he noticed which farms had good crops; he\n      heard the news about the restless farmer who was \"thinking about selling\n      out here and pulling his freight for Alberta.\" He asked the veterinarian\n      about the value of different breeds of stock; he inquired of Lyman Cass\n      whether or not Einar Gyseldson really had had a yield of forty bushels of\n      wheat to the acre. He was always consulting Julius Flickerbaugh, who\n      handled more real estate than law, and more law than justice. He studied\n      township maps, and read notices of auctions.",
                "Thus he was able to buy a quarter-section of land for one hundred and\n      fifty dollars an acre, and to sell it in a year or two, after installing a\n      cement floor in the barn and running water in the house, for one hundred\n      and eighty or even two hundred.",
                "He spoke of these details to Sam Clark . . . rather often.",
                "In all his games, cars and guns and land, he expected Carol to take an\n      interest. But he did not give her the facts which might have created\n      interest. He talked only of the obvious and tedious aspects; never of his\n      aspirations in finance, nor of the mechanical principles of motors.",
                "This month of romance she was eager to understand his hobbies. She\n      shivered in the garage while he spent half an hour in deciding whether to\n      put alcohol or patent non-freezing liquid into the radiator, or to drain\n      out the water entirely. \"Or no, then I wouldn't want to take her out if it\n      turned warm -- still, of course, I could fill the radiator again -- wouldn't\n      take so awful long -- just take a few pails of water -- still, if it\n      turned cold on me again before I drained it --  -- Course there's\n      some people that put in kerosene, but they say it rots the\n      hose-connections and --  -- Where did I put that lug-wrench?\"",
                "It was at this point that she gave up being a motorist and retired to the\n      house.",
                "In their new intimacy he was more communicative about his practise; he\n      informed her, with the invariable warning not to tell, that Mrs.\n      Sunderquist had another baby coming, that the \"hired girl at Howland's was\n      in trouble.\" But when she asked technical questions he did not know how to\n      answer; when she inquired, \"Exactly what is the method of taking out the\n      tonsils?\" he yawned, \"Tonsilectomy? Why you just --  -- If there's\n      pus, you operate. Just take 'em out. Seen the newspaper? What the devil\n      did Bea do with it?\"",
                "She did not try again.",
                "III",
                "They had gone to the \"movies.\" The movies were almost as vital to\n      Kennicott and the other solid citizens of Gopher Prairie as\n      land-speculation and guns and automobiles.",
                "The feature film portrayed a brave young Yankee who conquered a South\n      American republic. He turned the natives from their barbarous habits of\n      singing and laughing to the vigorous sanity, the Pep and Punch and Go, of\n      the North; he taught them to work in factories, to wear Klassy Kollege\n      Klothes, and to shout, \"Oh, you baby doll, watch me gather in the mazuma.\"\n       He changed nature itself. A mountain which had borne nothing but lilies\n      and cedars and loafing clouds was by his Hustle so inspirited that it\n      broke out in long wooden sheds, and piles of iron ore to be converted into\n      steamers to carry iron ore to be converted into steamers to carry iron\n      ore.",
                "The intellectual tension induced by the master film was relieved by a\n      livelier, more lyric and less philosophical drama: Mack Schnarken and the\n      Bathing Suit Babes in a comedy of manners entitled \"Right on the Coco.\"\n       Mr. Schnarken was at various high moments a cook, a life-guard, a\n      burlesque actor, and a sculptor. There was a hotel hallway up which\n      policemen charged, only to be stunned by plaster busts hurled upon them\n      from the innumerous doors. If the plot lacked lucidity, the dual motif of\n      legs and pie was clear and sure. Bathing and modeling were equally sound\n      occasions for legs; the wedding-scene was but an approach to the\n      thunderous climax when Mr. Schnarken slipped a piece of custard pie into\n      the clergyman's rear pocket.",
                "The audience in the Rosebud Movie Palace squealed and wiped their eyes;\n      they scrambled under the seats for overshoes, mittens, and mufflers, while\n      the screen announced that next week Mr. Schnarken might be seen in a new,\n      riproaring, extra-special superfeature of the Clean Comedy Corporation\n      entitled, \"Under Mollie's Bed.\"",
                "\"I'm glad,\" said Carol to Kennicott as they stooped before the northwest\n      gale which was torturing the barren street, \"that this is a moral country.\n      We don't allow any of these beastly frank novels.\"",
                "\"Yump. Vice Society and Postal Department won't stand for them. The\n      American people don't like filth.\"",
                "\"Yes. It's fine. I'm glad we have such dainty romances as 'Right on the\n      Coco' instead.\"",
                "\"Say what in heck do you think you're trying to do? Kid me?\"",
                "He was silent. She awaited his anger. She meditated upon his gutter\n      patois, the Boeotian dialect characteristic of Gopher Prairie. He laughed\n      puzzlingly. When they came into the glow of the house he laughed again. He\n      condescended:",
                "\"I've got to hand it to you. You're consistent, all right. I'd of thought\n      that after getting this look-in at a lot of good decent farmers, you'd get\n      over this high-art stuff, but you hang right on.\"",
                "\"Well --  -- \" To herself: \"He takes advantage of my trying to be\n      good.\"",
                "\"Tell you, Carrie: There's just three classes of people: folks that\n      haven't got any ideas at all; and cranks that kick about everything; and\n      Regular Guys, the fellows with sticktuitiveness, that boost and get the\n      world's work done.\"",
                "\"Then I'm probably a crank.\" She smiled negligently.",
                "\"No. I won't admit it. You do like to talk, but at a show-down you'd\n      prefer Sam Clark to any damn long-haired artist.\"",

                "\"Oh well!\" mockingly. \"My, we're just going to change everything, aren't\n      we!

But of this fast coming revolt\n      Carol had premonitions. She knew from some lost magazine article that in\n      Dublin were innovators called The Irish Players. She knew confusedly that\n      a man named Gordon Craig had painted scenery -- or had he written\n      plays? She felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering a\n      history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt with\n      senators and their pompous puerilities. She had a sensation of\n      familiarity; a dream of sitting in a Brussels cafe and going afterward to\n      a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall.",

There's going to be some\n      corkers coming: 'Lottie of Two-Gun Rancho,' and 'Cops and Crooks' -- real\n      Broadway stuff, with the New York casts. What's this junk you want to see?\n      Hm.

She\n      wailed, \"I haven't a single solitary thing that's fit to be seen in,\" and\n      enjoyed herself very much indeed.",

She closed her eyes and hummed, and did not know that\n      she was humming.",
                "She was the young poet attacking fame and Paris.",
                "In the Minneapolis station the crowd of lumberjacks, farmers, and Swedish\n      families with innumerous children and grandparents and paper parcels,\n      their foggy crowding and their clamor confused her. She felt rustic in\n      this once familiar city, after a year and a half of Gopher Prairie. She\n      was certain that Kennicott was taking the wrong trolley-car. By dusk, the\n      liquor warehouses, Hebraic clothing-shops, and lodging-houses on lower\n      Hennepin Avenue were smoky, hideous, ill-tempered. She was battered by the\n      noise and shuttling of the rush-hour traffic. When a clerk in an overcoat\n      too closely fitted at the waist stared at her, she moved nearer to\n      Kennicott's arm. The clerk was flippant and urban. He was a superior\n      person, used to this tumult. Was he laughing at her?",
                "For a moment she wanted the secure quiet of Gopher Prairie.",
                "In the hotel-lobby she was self-conscious. She was not used to hotels; she\n      remembered with jealousy how often Juanita Haydock talked of the famous\n      hotels in Chicago. She could not face the traveling salesmen, baronial in\n      large leather chairs. She wanted people to believe that her husband and\n      she were accustomed to luxury and chill elegance; she was faintly angry at\n      him for the vulgar way in which, after signing the register \"Dr. W. P.\n      Kennicott & wife,\" he bellowed at the clerk, \"Got a nice room with\n      bath for us, old man?\" She gazed about haughtily, but as she discovered\n      that no one was interested in her she felt foolish, and ashamed of her\n      irritation.",
                "She asserted, \"This silly lobby is too florid,\" and simultaneously she\n      admired it: the onyx columns with gilt capitals, the crown-embroidered\n      velvet curtains at the restaurant door, the silk-roped alcove where pretty\n      girls perpetually waited for mysterious men, the two-pound boxes of candy\n      and the variety of magazines at the news-stand. The hidden orchestra was\n      lively. She saw a man who looked like a European diplomat, in a loose\n      top-coat and a Homburg hat. A woman with a broadtail coat, a heavy lace\n      veil, pearl earrings, and a close black hat entered the restaurant.\n      \"Heavens! That's the first really smart woman I've seen in a year!\" Carol\n      exulted. She felt metropolitan.",
                "But as she followed Kennicott to the elevator the coat-check girl, a\n      confident young woman, with cheeks powdered like lime, and a blouse low\n      and thin and furiously crimson, inspected her, and under that supercilious\n      glance Carol was shy again. She unconsciously waited for the bellboy to\n      precede her into the elevator. When he snorted \"Go ahead!\" she was\n      mortified. He thought she was a hayseed, she worried.",
                "The moment she was in their room, with the bellboy safely out of the way,\n      she looked critically at Kennicott. For the first time in months she\n      really saw him.",
                "His clothes were too heavy and provincial. His decent gray suit, made by\n      Nat Hicks of Gopher Prairie, might have been of sheet iron; it had no\n      distinction of cut, no easy grace like the diplomat's Burberry. His black\n      shoes were blunt and not well polished. His scarf was a stupid brown. He\n      needed a shave.",
                "But she forgot her doubt as she realized the ingenuities of the room. She\n      ran about, turning on the taps of the bathtub, which gushed instead of\n      dribbling like the taps at home, snatching the new wash-rag out of its\n      envelope of oiled paper, trying the rose-shaded light between the twin\n      beds, pulling out the drawers of the kidney-shaped walnut desk to examine\n      the engraved stationery, planning to write on it to every one she knew,\n      admiring the claret-colored velvet armchair and the blue rug, testing the\n      ice-water tap, and squealing happily when the water really did come out\n      cold. She flung her arms about Kennicott, kissed him.",
                "\"Like it, old lady?\"",
                "\"It's adorable. It's so amusing. I love you for bringing me. You really\n      are a dear!\"",
                "He looked blankly indulgent, and yawned, and condescended, \"That's a\n      pretty slick arrangement on the radiator, so you can adjust it at any\n      temperature you want. Must take a big furnace to run this place. Gosh, I\n      hope Bea remembers to turn off the drafts tonight.\"",
                "Under the glass cover of the dressing-table was a menu with the most\n      enchanting dishes: breast of guinea hen De Vitresse, pommes de terre a la\n      Russe, meringue Chantilly, gateaux Bruxelles.",
                "\"Oh, let's --  -- I'm going to have a hot bath, and put on my new\n      hat with the wool flowers, and let's go down and eat for hours, and we'll\n      have a cocktail!\" she chanted.",
                "While Kennicott labored over ordering it was annoying to see him permit\n      the waiter to be impertinent, but as the cocktail elevated her to a bridge\n      among colored stars, as the oysters came in -- not canned oysters in\n      the Gopher Prairie fashion, but on the half-shell -- she cried, \"If you\n      only knew how wonderful it is not to have had to plan this dinner, and\n      order it at the butcher's and fuss and think about it, and then watch Bea\n      cook it! I feel so free. And to have new kinds of food, and different\n      patterns of dishes and linen, and not worry about whether the pudding is\n      being spoiled! Oh, this is a great moment for me!\"",

                "They had all the experiences of provincials in a metropolis. After\n      breakfast Carol bustled to a hair-dresser's, bought gloves and a blouse,\n      and importantly met Kennicott in front of an optician's, in accordance\n      with plans laid down, revised, and verified. They admired the diamonds and\n      furs and frosty silverware and mahogany chairs and polished morocco\n      sewing-boxes in shop-windows, and were abashed by the throngs in the\n      department-stores, and were bullied by a clerk into buying too many shirts\n      for Kennicott, and gaped at the \"clever novelty perfumes -- just in\n      from New York.\" Carol got three books on the theater, and spent an\n      exultant hour in warning herself that she could not afford this rajah-silk\n      frock, in thinking how envious it would make Juanita Haydock, in closing\n      her eyes, and buying it. Kennicott went from shop to shop, earnestly\n      hunting down a felt-covered device to keep the windshield of his car clear\n      of rain.",
                "They dined extravagantly at their hotel at night, and next morning sneaked\n      round the corner to economize at a Childs' Restaurant. They were tired by\n      three in the afternoon, and dozed at the motion-pictures and said they\n      wished they were back in Gopher Prairie -- and by eleven in the evening\n      they were again so lively that they went to a Chinese restaurant that was\n      frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on pay-days. They sat at a teak\n      and marble table eating Eggs Fooyung, and listened to a brassy automatic\n      piano, and were altogether cosmopolitan.",
                "On the street they met people from home -- the McGanums. They laughed,\n      shook hands repeatedly, and exclaimed, \"Well, this is quite a\n      coincidence!\" They asked when the McGanums had come down, and begged for\n      news of the town they had left two days before. Whatever the McGanums were\n      at home, here they stood out as so superior to all the undistinguishable\n      strangers absurdly hurrying past that the Kennicotts held them as long as\n      they could. The McGanums said good-by as though they were going to Tibet\n      instead of to the station to catch No. 7 north.",
                "They explored Minneapolis. Kennicott was conversational and technical\n      regarding gluten and cockle-cylinders and No. I Hard, when they were shown\n      through the gray stone hulks and new cement elevators of the largest\n      flour-mills in the world. They looked across Loring Park and the Parade to\n      the towers of St. Mark's and the Procathedral, and the red roofs of houses\n      climbing Kenwood Hill. They drove about the chain of garden-circled lakes,\n      and viewed the houses of the millers and lumbermen and real estate peers -- the\n      potentates of the expanding city. They surveyed the small eccentric\n      bungalows with pergolas, the houses of pebbledash and tapestry brick with\n      sleeping-porches above sun-parlors, and one vast incredible chateau\n      fronting the Lake of the Isles. They tramped through a shining-new section\n      of apartment-houses; not the tall bleak apartments of Eastern cities but\n      low structures of cheerful yellow brick, in which each flat had its\n      glass-enclosed porch with swinging couch and scarlet cushions and Russian\n      brass bowls. Between a waste of tracks and a raw gouged hill they found\n      poverty in staggering shanties.",
                "They saw miles of the city which they had never known in their days of\n      absorption in college. They were distinguished explorers, and they\n      remarked, in great mutual esteem, \"I bet Harry Haydock's never seen the\n      City like this! Why, he'd never have sense enough to study the machinery\n      in the mills, or go through all these outlying districts. Wonder folks in\n      Gopher Prairie wouldn't use their legs and explore, the way we do!\"",
                "They had two meals with Carol's sister, and were bored, and felt that\n      intimacy which beatifies married people when they suddenly admit that they\n      equally dislike a relative of either of them.",
                "So it was with affection but also with weariness that they approached the\n      evening on which Carol was to see the plays at the dramatic school.\n      Kennicott suggested not going. \"So darn tired from all this walking; don't\n      know but what we better turn in early and get rested up.\" It was only from\n      duty that Carol dragged him and herself out of the warm hotel, into a\n      stinking trolley, up the brownstone steps of the converted residence which\n      lugubriously housed the dramatic school.",

                "They were in a long whitewashed hall with a clumsy draw-curtain across the\n      front. The folding chairs were filled with people who looked washed and\n      ironed: parents of the pupils, girl students, dutiful teachers.",
                "\"Strikes me it's going to be punk. If the first play isn't good, let's\n      beat it,\" said Kennicott hopefully.",
                "\"All right,\" she yawned. With hazy eyes she tried to read the lists of\n      characters, which were hidden among lifeless advertisements of pianos,\n      music-dealers, restaurants, candy.",
                "She regarded the Schnitzler play with no vast interest. The actors moved\n      and spoke stiffly. Just as its cynicism was beginning to rouse her\n      village-dulled frivolity, it was over.",
                "\"Don't think a whale of a lot of that. How about taking a sneak?\"\n       petitioned Kennicott.",
                "\"Oh, let's try the next one, 'How He Lied to Her Husband.'\"",
                "The Shaw conceit amused her, and perplexed Kennicott:",
                "\"Strikes me it's darn fresh. Thought it would be racy. Don't know as I\n      think much of a play where a husband actually claims he wants a fellow to\n      make love to his wife. No husband ever did that! Shall we shake a leg?\"",
                "\"I want to see this Yeats thing, 'Land of Heart's Desire.' I used to love\n      it in college.\" She was awake now, and urgent. \"I know you didn't care so\n      much for Yeats when I read him aloud to you, but you just see if you don't\n      adore him on the stage.\"",
                "Most of the cast were as unwieldy as oak chairs marching, and the setting\n      was an arty arrangement of batik scarfs and heavy tables, but Maire Bruin\n      was slim as Carol, and larger-eyed, and her voice was a morning bell. In\n      her, Carol lived, and on her lifting voice was transported from this\n      sleepy small-town husband and all the rows of polite parents to the stilly\n      loft of a thatched cottage where in a green dimness, beside a window\n      caressed by linden branches, she bent over a chronicle of twilight women\n      and the ancient gods.",
                "\"Well -- gosh -- nice kid played that girl -- good-looker,\" said\n      Kennicott. \"Want to stay for the last piece? Heh?\"",
                "She shivered. She did not answer.",
                "The curtain was again drawn aside. On the stage they saw nothing but long\n      green curtains and a leather chair. Two young men in brown robes like\n      furniture-covers were gesturing vacuously and droning cryptic sentences\n      full of repetitions.",
                "It was Carol's first hearing of Dunsany. She sympathized with the restless\n      Kennicott as he felt in his pocket for a cigar and unhappily put it back.",
                "Without understanding when or how, without a tangible change in the\n      stilted intoning of the stage-puppets, she was conscious of another time\n      and place.",
                "Stately and aloof among vainglorious tiring-maids, a queen in robes that\n      murmured on the marble floor, she trod the gallery of a crumbling palace.\n      In the courtyard, elephants trumpeted, and swart men with beards dyed\n      crimson stood with blood-stained hands folded upon their hilts, guarding\n      the caravan from El Sharnak, the camels with Tyrian stuffs of topaz and\n      cinnabar. Beyond the turrets of the outer wall the jungle glared and\n      shrieked, and the sun was furious above drenched orchids. A youth came\n      striding through the steel-bossed doors, the sword-bitten doors that were\n      higher than ten tall men. He was in flexible mail, and under the rim of\n      his planished morion were amorous curls. His hand was out to her; before\n      she touched it she could feel its warmth --  --",

                "Juanita Haydock broke in with a derisive, \"Oh rats, Raymie! Can the\n      mother's influence! I say let's give something with some class to it. I\n      bet we could get the rights to 'The Girl from Kankakee,' and that's a real\n      show. It ran for eleven months in New York!\"",

All through\n      the spring the association thrilled to its own talent in that dismal room.\n      They cleared out the bunting, ballot-boxes, handbills, legless chairs.\n      They attacked the stage. It was a simple-minded stage. It was raised above\n      the floor, and it did have a movable curtain, painted with the\n      advertisement of a druggist dead these ten years, but otherwise it might\n      not have been recognized as a stage. There were two dressing-rooms, one\n      for men, one for women, on either side. The dressing-room doors were also\n      the stage-entrances, opening from the house, and many a citizen of Gopher\n      Prairie had for his first glimpse of romance the bare shoulders of the\n      leading woman.",

There were three\n      gradations of lighting: full on, half on, and entirely off.",
                "This was the only theater in Gopher Prairie. It was known as the \"op'ra\n      house.\" Once, strolling companies had used it for performances of \"The Two\n      Orphans,\" and \"Nellie the Beautiful Cloak Model,\" and \"Othello\" with\n      specialties between acts, but now the motion-pictures had ousted the gipsy\n      drama.",
                "Carol intended to be furiously modern in constructing the office-set, the\n      drawing-room for Mr. Grimm, and the Humble Home near Kankakee. It was the\n      first time that any one in Gopher Prairie had been so revolutionary as to\n      use enclosed scenes with continuous side-walls. The rooms in the op'ra\n      house sets had separate wing-pieces for sides, which simplified\n      dramaturgy, as the villain could always get out of the hero's way by\n      walking out through the wall.",
                "The inhabitants of the Humble Home were supposed to be amiable and\n      intelligent. Carol planned for them a simple set with warm color. She\n      could see the beginning of the play: all dark save the high settles and\n      the solid wooden table between them, which were to be illuminated by a ray\n      from offstage. The high light was a polished copper pot filled with\n      primroses. Less clearly she sketched the Grimm drawing-room as a series of\n      cool high white arches.",
                "As to how she was to produce these effects she had no notion.",
                "She discovered that, despite the enthusiastic young writers, the drama was\n      not half so native and close to the soil as motor cars and telephones. She\n      discovered that simple arts require sophisticated training. She discovered\n      that to produce one perfect stage-picture would be as difficult as to turn\n      all of Gopher Prairie into a Georgian garden.",
                "She read all she could find regarding staging, she bought paint and light\n      wood; she borrowed furniture and drapes unscrupulously; she made Kennicott\n      turn carpenter. She collided with the problem of lighting. Against the\n      protest of Kennicott and Vida she mortgaged the association by sending to\n      Minneapolis for a baby spotlight, a strip light, a dimming device, and\n      blue and amber bulbs; and with the gloating rapture of a born painter\n      first turned loose among colors, she spent absorbed evenings in grouping,\n      dimming-painting with lights.",
                "Only Kennicott, Guy, and Vida helped her. They speculated as to how flats\n      could be lashed together to form a wall; they hung crocus-yellow curtains\n      at the windows; they blacked the sheet-iron stove; they put on aprons and\n      swept. The rest of the association dropped into the theater every evening,\n      and were literary and superior. They had borrowed Carol's manuals of\n      play-production and had become extremely stagey in vocabulary.",

                "\"I don't want to hand myself anything but I believe I'll give a swell\n      performance in this first act,\" confided Juanita. \"I wish Carol wasn't so\n      bossy though. She doesn't understand clothes. I want to wear, oh, a dandy\n      dress I have -- all scarlet -- and I said to her, 'When I enter\n      wouldn't it knock their eyes out if I just stood there at the door in this\n      straight scarlet thing?' But she wouldn't let me.\"",
                "Young Rita agreed, \"She's so much taken up with her old details and\n      carpentering and everything that she can't see the picture as a whole. Now\n      I thought it would be lovely if we had an office-scene like the one in\n      'Little, But Oh My!' Because I SAW that, in Duluth. But she simply\n      wouldn't listen at all.\"",
                "Juanita sighed, \"I wanted to give one speech like Ethel Barrymore would,\n      if she was in a play like this. (Harry and I heard her one time in\n      Minneapolis -- we had dandy seats, in the orchestra -- I just know I\n      could imitate her.) Carol didn't pay any attention to my suggestion. I\n      don't want to criticize but I guess Ethel knows more about acting than\n      Carol does!\"",
                "\"Say, do you think Carol has the right dope about using a strip light\n      behind the fireplace in the second act?

'Yes, and it would be lovely to have Eleanora Duse play\n      the lead,' she said, 'and aside from the fact that it's evening in the\n      first act, you're a great technician,' she said. I must say I think she\n      was pretty sarcastic. I've been reading up, and I know I could build a\n      cyclorama, if she didn't want to run everything.\"",

                "Carol did not resent their criticisms, she didn't very much resent their\n      sudden knowledge, so long as they let her make pictures. It was at\n      rehearsals that the quarrrels broke. No one understood that rehearsals\n      were as real engagements as bridge-games or sociables at the Episcopal\n      Church. They gaily came in half an hour late, or they vociferously came in\n      ten minutes early, and they were so hurt that they whispered about\n      resigning when Carol protested. They telephoned, \"I don't think I'd better\n      come out; afraid the dampness might start my toothache,\" or \"Guess can't\n      make it tonight; Dave wants me to sit in on a poker game.\"",

For all her visions she\n      could not control her voice, and she was bored by the fiftieth repetition\n      of her few lines as maid. Guy pulled his soft mustache, looked\n      self-conscious, and turned Mr. Grimm into a limp dummy. But Raymie, as the\n      villain, had no repressions. The tilt of his head was full of character;\n      his drawl was admirably vicious.",

                "They were weary. \"We know our parts well enough now; what's the use of\n      getting sick of them?\" they complained. They began to skylark; to play\n      with the sacred lights; to giggle when Carol was trying to make the\n      sentimental Myrtle Cass into a humorous office-boy; to act everything but\n      \"The Girl from Kankakee.\" After loafing through his proper part Dr. Terry\n      Gould had great applause for his burlesque of \"Hamlet.\" Even Raymie lost\n      his simple faith, and tried to show that he could do a vaudeville shuffle.",
                "Carol turned on the company. \"See here, I want this nonsense to stop.\n      We've simply got to get down to work.\"",
                "Juanita Haydock led the mutiny: \"Look here, Carol, don't be so bossy.\n      After all, we're doing this play principally for the fun of it, and if we\n      have fun out of a lot of monkey-shines, why then --  -- \"",

I want\n      fun out of this, of course. Only --  -- I don't think it would be\n      less fun, but more, to produce as perfect a play as we can.\" She was\n      curiously exalted; her voice was strained; she stared not at the company\n      but at the grotesques scrawled on the backs of wing-pieces by forgotten\n      stage-hands. \"I wonder if you can understand the 'fun' of making a\n      beautiful thing, the pride and satisfaction of it, and the holiness!\"",

They\n      presented \"Sunbonnet Nell: A Dramatic Comedy of the Ozarks,\" with J.\n      Witherbee Boothby wringing the soul by his resonant \"Yuh ain't done right\n      by mah little gal, Mr. City Man, but yer a-goin' to find that back in\n      these-yere hills there's honest folks and good shots!\"",

                "Carol shook her head. \"Juanita is right. I'm a fool. Holiness of the\n      drama! Bernard Shaw! The only trouble with 'The Girl from Kankakee' is\n      that it's too subtle for Gopher Prairie!\"",
                "She sought faith in spacious banal phrases, taken from books: \"the\n      instinctive nobility of simple souls,\" \"need only the opportunity, to\n      appreciate fine things,\" and \"sturdy exponents of democracy.\" But these\n      optimisms did not sound so loud as the laughter of the audience at the\n      funny-man's line, \"Yes, by heckelum, I'm a smart fella.\" She wanted to\n      give up the play, the dramatic association, the town. As she came out of\n      the tent and walked with Kennicott down the dusty spring street, she\n      peered at this straggling wooden village and felt that she could not\n      possibly stay here through all of tomorrow.",

For\n      the love o' Mike, how do you expect me to get your eyelids dark if you\n      keep a-wigglin'?\" The actors were beseeching, \"Hey, Del, put some red in\n      my nostrils -- you put some in Rita's -- gee, you didn't hardly do\n      anything to my face.\"",
                "They were enormously theatric.

The local Four Hundred also report that he is a great hand at\n      shaking the light fantastic tootsies in the dance.

                "She sought to be sensible; she elaborately explained to herself that it\n      was hysterical to condemn Gopher Prairie because it did not foam over the\n      drama. Its justification was in its service as a market-town for farmers.\n      How bravely and generously it did its work, forwarding the bread of the\n      world, feeding and healing the farmers!",
                "Then, on the corner below her husband's office, she heard a farmer holding\n      forth:",
                "\"Sure. Course I was beaten. The shipper and the grocers here wouldn't pay\n      us a decent price for our potatoes, even though folks in the cities were\n      howling for 'em. So we says, well, we'll get a truck and ship 'em right\n      down to Minneapolis. But the commission merchants there were in cahoots\n      with the local shipper here; they said they wouldn't pay us a cent more\n      than he would, not even if they was nearer to the market. Well, we found\n      we could get higher prices in Chicago, but when we tried to get freight\n      cars to ship there, the railroads wouldn't let us have 'em -- even\n      though they had cars standing empty right here in the yards. There you got\n      it -- good market, and these towns keeping us from it. Gus, that's the\n      way these towns work all the time. They pay what they want to for our\n      wheat, but we pay what they want us to for their clothes. Stowbody and\n      Dawson foreclose every mortgage they can, and put in tenant farmers. The\n      Dauntless lies to us about the Nonpartisan League, the lawyers sting us,\n      the machinery-dealers hate to carry us over bad years, and then their\n      daughters put on swell dresses and look at us as if we were a bunch of\n      hoboes. Man, I'd like to burn this town!\"",
                "Kennicott observed, \"There's that old crank Wes Brannigan shooting off his\n      mouth again. Gosh, but he loves to hear himself talk! They ought to run\n      that fellow out of town!\"",

                "II",
                "Bea and Miles Bjornstam were married in June, a month after \"The Girl from\n      Kankakee.\" Miles had turned respectable. He had renounced his criticisms\n      of state and society; he had given up roving as horse-trader, and wearing\n      red mackinaws in lumber-camps; he had gone to work as engineer in Jackson\n      Elder's planing-mill; he was to be seen upon the streets endeavoring to be\n      neighborly with suspicious men whom he had taunted for years.",
                "Carol was the patroness and manager of the wedding. Juanita Haydock\n      mocked, \"You're a chump to let a good hired girl like Bea go. Besides! How\n      do you know it's a good thing, her marrying a sassy bum like this awful\n      Red Swede person? Get wise! Chase the man off with a mop, and hold onto\n      your Svenska while the holding's good. Huh? Me go to their Scandahoofian\n      wedding? Not a chance!\"",
                "The other matrons echoed Juanita. Carol was dismayed by the casualness of\n      their cruelty, but she persisted. Miles had exclaimed to her, \"Jack Elder\n      says maybe he'll come to the wedding! Gee, it would be nice to have Bea\n      meet the Boss as a reg'lar married lady. Some day I'll be so well off that\n      Bea can play with Mrs. Elder -- and you! Watch us!\"",
                "There was an uneasy knot of only nine guests at the service in the\n      unpainted Lutheran Church -- Carol, Kennicott, Guy Pollock, and the\n      Champ Perrys, all brought by Carol; Bea's frightened rustic parents, her\n      cousin Tina, and Pete, Miles's ex-partner in horse-trading, a surly, hairy\n      man who had bought a black suit and come twelve hundred miles from Spokane\n      for the event.",
                "Miles continuously glanced back at the church door. Jackson Elder did not\n      appear. The door did not once open after the awkward entrance of the first\n      guests. Miles's hand closed on Bea's arm.",
                "He had, with Carol's help, made his shanty over into a cottage with white\n      curtains and a canary and a chintz chair.",

                "Bea's successor was the oldish, broad, silent Oscarina, who was suspicious\n      of her frivolous mistress for a month, so that Juanita Haydock was able to\n      crow, \"There, smarty, I told you you'd run into the Domestic Problem!\" But\n      Oscarina adopted Carol as a daughter, and with her as faithful to the\n      kitchen as Bea had been, there was nothing changed in Carol's life.",
                "III",
                "She was unexpectedly appointed to the town library-board by Ole Jenson,\n      the new mayor. The other members were Dr. Westlake, Lyman Cass, Julius\n      Flickerbaugh the attorney, Guy Pollock, and Martin Mahoney, former\n      livery-stable keeper and now owner of a garage. She was delighted. She\n      went to the first meeting rather condescendingly, regarding herself as the\n      only one besides Guy who knew anything about books or library methods. She\n      was planning to revolutionize the whole system.",
                "Her condescension was ruined and her humility wholesomely increased when\n      she found the board, in the shabby room on the second floor of the house\n      which had been converted into the library, not discussing the weather and\n      longing to play checkers, but talking about books. She discovered that\n      amiable old Dr. Westlake read everything in verse and \"light fiction\";\n      that Lyman Cass, the veal-faced, bristly-bearded owner of the mill, had\n      tramped through Gibbon, Hume, Grote, Prescott, and the other thick\n      historians; that he could repeat pages from them -- and did. When Dr.\n      Westlake whispered to her, \"Yes, Lym is a very well-informed man, but he's\n      modest about it,\" she felt uninformed and immodest, and scolded at herself\n      that she had missed the human potentialities in this vast Gopher Prairie.\n      When Dr. Westlake quoted the \"Paradiso,\" \"Don Quixote,\" \"Wilhelm Meister,\"\n       and the Koran, she reflected that no one she knew, not even her father,\n      had read all four.",
                "She came diffidently to the second meeting of the board. She did not plan\n      to revolutionize anything. She hoped that the wise elders might be so\n      tolerant as to listen to her suggestions about changing the shelving of\n      the juveniles.",
                "Yet after four sessions of the library-board she was where she had been\n      before the first session. She had found that for all their pride in being\n      reading men, Westlake and Cass and even Guy had no conception of making\n      the library familiar to the whole town. They used it, they passed\n      resolutions about it, and they left it as dead as Moses. Only the Henty\n      books and the Elsie books and the latest optimisms by moral female\n      novelists and virile clergymen were in general demand, and the board\n      themselves were interested only in old, stilted volumes. They had no\n      tenderness for the noisiness of youth discovering great literature.",
                "If she was egotistic about her tiny learning, they were at least as much\n      so regarding theirs. And for all their talk of the need of additional\n      library-tax none of them was willing to risk censure by battling for it,\n      though they now had so small a fund that, after paying for rent, heat,\n      light, and Miss Villets's salary, they had only a hundred dollars a year\n      for the purchase of books.",
                "The Incident of the Seventeen Cents killed her none too enduring interest.",
                "She had come to the board-meeting singing with a plan. She had made a list\n      of thirty European novels of the past ten years, with twenty important\n      books on psychology, education, and economics which the library lacked.\n      She had made Kennicott promise to give fifteen dollars. If each of the\n      board would contribute the same, they could have the books.",
                "Lym Cass looked alarmed, scratched himself, and protested, \"I think it\n      would be a bad precedent for the board-members to contribute money -- uh -- not\n      that I mind, but it wouldn't be fair -- establish precedent. Gracious!\n      They don't pay us a cent for our services! Certainly can't expect us to\n      pay for the privilege of serving!\"",
                "Only Guy looked sympathetic, and he stroked the pine table and said\n      nothing.",
                "The rest of the meeting they gave to a bellicose investigation of the fact\n      that there was seventeen cents less than there should be in the Fund. Miss\n      Villets was summoned; she spent half an hour in explosively defending\n      herself; the seventeen cents were gnawed over, penny by penny; and Carol,\n      glancing at the carefully inscribed list which had been so lovely and\n      exciting an hour before, was silent, and sorry for Miss Villets, and\n      sorrier for herself.",
                "She was reasonably regular in attendance till her two years were up and\n      Vida Sherwin was appointed to the board in her place, but she did not try\n      to be revolutionary. In the plodding course of her life there was nothing\n      changed, and nothing new.",
                "IV",
                "Kennicott made an excellent land-deal, but as he told her none of the\n      details, she was not greatly exalted or agitated. What did agitate her was\n      his announcement, half whispered and half blurted, half tender and half\n      coldly medical, that they \"ought to have a baby, now they could afford\n      it.\" They had so long agreed that \"perhaps it would be just as well not to\n      have any children for a while yet,\" that childlessness had come to be\n      natural. Now, she feared and longed and did not know; she hesitatingly\n      assented, and wished that she had not assented.",
                "As there appeared no change in their drowsy relations, she forgot all\n      about it, and life was planless.",

                "Idling on the porch of their summer cottage at the lake, on afternoons\n      when Kennicott was in town, when the water was glazed and the whole air\n      languid, she pictured a hundred escapes: Fifth Avenue in a snow-storm,\n      with limousines, golden shops, a cathedral spire. A reed hut on fantastic\n      piles above the mud of a jungle river. A suite in Paris, immense high\n      grave rooms, with lambrequins and a balcony. The Enchanted Mesa. An\n      ancient stone mill in Maryland, at the turn of the road, between rocky\n      brook and abrupt hills. An upland moor of sheep and flitting cool\n      sunlight. A clanging dock where steel cranes unloaded steamers from Buenos\n      Ayres and Tsing-tao. A Munich concert-hall, and a famous 'cellist playing -- playing\n      to her.",
                "One scene had a persistent witchery:",
                "She stood on a terrace overlooking a boulevard by the warm sea. She was\n      certain, though she had no reason for it, that the place was Mentone.\n      Along the drive below her swept barouches, with a mechanical tlot-tlot,\n      tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, and great cars with polished black hoods and engines\n      quiet as the sigh of an old man. In them were women erect, slender,\n      enameled, and expressionless as marionettes, their small hands upon\n      parasols, their unchanging eyes always forward, ignoring the men beside\n      them, tall men with gray hair and distinguished faces. Beyond the drive\n      were painted sea and painted sands, and blue and yellow pavilions. Nothing\n      moved except the gliding carriages, and the people were small and wooden,\n      spots in a picture drenched with gold and hard bright blues. There was no\n      sound of sea or winds; no softness of whispers nor of falling petals;\n      nothing but yellow and cobalt and staring light, and the never-changing\n      tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot --  --",
                "She startled. She whimpered. It was the rapid ticking of the clock which\n      had hypnotized her into hearing the steady hoofs. No aching color of the\n      sea and pride of supercilious people, but the reality of a round-bellied\n      nickel alarm-clock on a shelf against a fuzzy unplaned pine wall, with a\n      stiff gray wash-rag hanging above it and a kerosene-stove standing below.",
                "A thousand dreams governed by the fiction she had read, drawn from the\n      pictures she had envied, absorbed her drowsy lake afternoons, but always\n      in the midst of them Kennicott came out from town, drew on khaki trousers\n      which were plastered with dry fish-scales, asked, \"Enjoying yourself?\" and\n      did not listen to her answer.",
                "And nothing was changed, and there was no reason to believe that there\n      ever would be change.",
                "VI",
                "Trains!",
                "At the lake cottage she missed the passing of the trains. She realized\n      that in town she had depended upon them for assurance that there remained\n      a world beyond.",
                "The railroad was more than a means of transportation to Gopher Prairie. It\n      was a new god; a monster of steel limbs, oak ribs, flesh of gravel, and a\n      stupendous hunger for freight; a deity created by man that he might keep\n      himself respectful to Property, as elsewhere he had elevated and served as\n      tribal gods the mines, cotton-mills, motor-factories, colleges, army.",
                "The East remembered generations when there had been no railroad, and had\n      no awe of it; but here the railroads had been before time was. The towns\n      had been staked out on barren prairie as convenient points for future\n      train-halts; and back in 1860 and 1870 there had been much profit, much\n      opportunity to found aristocratic families, in the possession of advance\n      knowledge as to where the towns would arise.",
                "If a town was in disfavor, the railroad could ignore it, cut it off from\n      commerce, slay it. To Gopher Prairie the tracks were eternal verities, and\n      boards of railroad directors an omnipotence. The smallest boy or the most\n      secluded grandam could tell you whether No. 32 had a hot-box last Tuesday,\n      whether No. 7 was going to put on an extra day-coach; and the name of the\n      president of the road was familiar to every breakfast table.",
                "Even in this new era of motors the citizens went down to the station to\n      see the trains go through. It was their romance; their only mystery\n      besides mass at the Catholic Church; and from the trains came lords of the\n      outer world -- traveling salesmen with piping on their waistcoats, and\n      visiting cousins from Milwaukee.",
                "Gopher Prairie had once been a \"division-point.\" The roundhouse and\n      repair-shops were gone, but two conductors still retained residence, and\n      they were persons of distinction, men who traveled and talked to\n      strangers, who wore uniforms with brass buttons, and knew all about these\n      crooked games of con-men. They were a special caste, neither above nor\n      below the Haydocks, but apart, artists and adventurers.",
                "The night telegraph-operator at the railroad station was the most\n      melodramatic figure in town: awake at three in the morning, alone in a\n      room hectic with clatter of the telegraph key. All night he \"talked\" to\n      operators twenty, fifty, a hundred miles away. It was always to be\n      expected that he would be held up by robbers. He never was, but round him\n      was a suggestion of masked faces at the window, revolvers, cords binding\n      him to a chair, his struggle to crawl to the key before he fainted.",
                "During blizzards everything about the railroad was melodramatic. There\n      were days when the town was completely shut off, when they had no mail, no\n      express, no fresh meat, no newspapers. At last the rotary snow-plow came\n      through, bucking the drifts, sending up a geyser, and the way to the\n      Outside was open again. The brakemen, in mufflers and fur caps, running\n      along the tops of ice-coated freight-cars; the engineers scratching frost\n      from the cab windows and looking out, inscrutable, self-contained, pilots\n      of the prairie sea -- they were heroism, they were to Carol the daring\n      of the quest in a world of groceries and sermons.",
                "To the small boys the railroad was a familiar playground. They climbed the\n      iron ladders on the sides of the box-cars; built fires behind piles of old\n      ties; waved to favorite brakemen. But to Carol it was magic.",
                "She was motoring with Kennicott, the car lumping through darkness, the\n      lights showing mud-puddles and ragged weeds by the road. A train coming! A\n      rapid chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck. It was hurling past -- the\n      Pacific Flyer, an arrow of golden flame. Light from the fire-box splashed\n      the under side of the trailing smoke. Instantly the vision was gone; Carol\n      was back in the long darkness; and Kennicott was giving his version of\n      that fire and wonder: \"No. 19. Must be 'bout ten minutes late.\"",
                "In town, she listened from bed to the express whistling in the cut a mile\n      north. Uuuuuuu! -- faint, nervous, distrait, horn of the free night\n      riders journeying to the tall towns where were laughter and banners and\n      the sound of bells -- Uuuuu! Uuuuu! -- the world going by -- Uuuuuuu! -- fainter,\n      more wistful, gone.",
                "Down here there were no trains. The stillness was very great. The prairie\n      encircled the lake, lay round her, raw, dusty, thick. Only the train could\n      cut it. Some day she would take a train; and that would be a great taking.",
                "VII",
                "She turned to the Chautauqua as she had turned to the dramatic\n      association, to the library-board.",
                "Besides the permanent Mother Chautauqua, in New York, there are, all over\n      these States, commercial Chautauqua companies which send out to every\n      smallest town troupes of lecturers and \"entertainers\" to give a week of\n      culture under canvas. Living in Minneapolis, Carol had never encountered\n      the ambulant Chautauqua, and the announcement of its coming to Gopher\n      Prairie gave her hope that others might be doing the vague things which\n      she had attempted. She pictured a condensed university course brought to\n      the people. Mornings when she came in from the lake with Kennicott she saw\n      placards in every shop-window, and strung on a cord across Main Street, a\n      line of pennants alternately worded \"The Boland Chautauqua COMING!\" and \"A\n      solid week of inspiration and enjoyment!\" But she was disappointed when\n      she saw the program. It did not seem to be a tabloid university; it did\n      not seem to be any kind of a university; it seemed to be a combination of\n      vaudeville performance Y. M. C. A. lecture, and the graduation exercises\n      of an elocution class.",
                "She took her doubt to Kennicott. He insisted, \"Well, maybe it won't be so\n      awful darn intellectual, the way you and I might like it, but it's a whole\n      lot better than nothing.\" Vida Sherwin added, \"They have some splendid\n      speakers. If the people don't carry off so much actual information, they\n      do get a lot of new ideas, and that's what counts.\"",
                "During the Chautauqua Carol attended three evening meetings, two afternoon\n      meetings, and one in the morning. She was impressed by the audience: the\n      sallow women in skirts and blouses, eager to be made to think, the men in\n      vests and shirt-sleeves, eager to be allowed to laugh, and the wriggling\n      children, eager to sneak away. She liked the plain benches, the portable\n      stage under its red marquee, the great tent over all, shadowy above\n      strings of incandescent bulbs at night and by day casting an amber\n      radiance on the patient crowd. The scent of dust and trampled grass and\n      sun-baked wood gave her an illusion of Syrian caravans; she forgot the\n      speakers while she listened to noises outside the tent: two farmers\n      talking hoarsely, a wagon creaking down Main Street, the crow of a\n      rooster. She was content. But it was the contentment of the lost hunter\n      stopping to rest.",
                "For from the Chautauqua itself she got nothing but wind and chaff and\n      heavy laughter, the laughter of yokels at old jokes, a mirthless and\n      primitive sound like the cries of beasts on a farm.",
                "These were the several instructors in the condensed university's seven-day\n      course:",
                "Nine lecturers, four of them ex-ministers, and one an ex-congressman, all\n      of them delivering \"inspirational addresses.\" The only facts or opinions\n      which Carol derived from them were: Lincoln was a celebrated president of\n      the United States, but in his youth extremely poor. James J. Hill was the\n      best-known railroad-man of the West, and in his youth extremely poor.\n      Honesty and courtesy in business are preferable to boorishness and exposed\n      trickery, but this is not to be taken personally, since all persons in\n      Gopher Prairie are known to be honest and courteous.

                "Three brass-bands, a company of six opera-singers, a Hawaiian sextette,\n      and four youths who played saxophones and guitars disguised as\n      wash-boards. The most applauded pieces were those, such as the \"Lucia\"\n       inevitability, which the audience had heard most often.",
                "The local superintendent, who remained through the week while the other\n      enlighteners went to other Chautauquas for their daily performances. The\n      superintendent was a bookish, underfed man who worked hard at rousing\n      artificial enthusiasm, at trying to make the audience cheer by dividing\n      them into competitive squads and telling them that they were intelligent\n      and made splendid communal noises. He gave most of the morning lectures,\n      droning with equal unhappy facility about poetry, the Holy Land, and the\n      injustice to employers in any system of profit-sharing.",
                "The final item was a man who neither lectured, inspired, nor entertained;\n      a plain little man with his hands in his pockets. All the other speakers\n      had confessed, \"I cannot keep from telling the citizens of your beautiful\n      city that none of the talent on this circuit have found a more charming\n      spot or more enterprising and hospitable people.\" But the little man\n      suggested that the architecture of Gopher Prairie was haphazard, and that\n      it was sottish to let the lake-front be monopolized by the cinder-heaped\n      wall of the railroad embankment. Afterward the audience grumbled, \"Maybe\n      that guy's got the right dope, but what's the use of looking on the dark\n      side of things all the time? New ideas are first-rate, but not all this\n      criticism. Enough trouble in life without looking for it!\"",

                "When Carol talked about the Balkans, and the possibility of a German\n      revolution, Kennicott yawned, \"Oh yes, it's a great old scrap, but it's\n      none of our business. Folks out here are too busy growing corn to monkey\n      with any fool war that those foreigners want to get themselves into.\"",
                "It was Miles Bjornstam who said, \"I can't figure it out. I'm opposed to\n      wars, but still, seems like Germany has got to be licked because them\n      Junkers stands in the way of progress.\"",
                "She was calling on Miles and Bea, early in autumn. They had received her\n      with cries, with dusting of chairs, and a running to fetch water for\n      coffee. Miles stood and beamed at her. He fell often and joyously into his\n      old irreverence about the lords of Gopher Prairie, but always -- with a\n      certain difficulty -- he added something decorous and appreciative.",
                "\"Lots of people have come to see you, haven't they?\" Carol hinted.",
                "\"Why, Bea's cousin Tina comes in right along, and the foreman at the mill,\n      and --  -- Oh, we have good times. Say, take a look at that Bea!\n      Wouldn't you think she was a canary-bird, to listen to her, and to see\n      that Scandahoofian tow-head of hers? But say, know what she is? She's a\n      mother hen! Way she fusses over me -- way she makes old Miles wear a\n      necktie! Hate to spoil her by letting her hear it, but she's one pretty\n      darn nice -- nice --  -- Hell! What do we care if none of the\n      dirty snobs come and call? We've got each other.\"",
                "Carol worried about their struggle, but she forgot it in the stress of\n      sickness and fear. For that autumn she knew that a baby was coming, that\n      at last life promised to be interesting in the peril of the great change."

                "THE baby was coming. Each morning she was nauseated, chilly, bedraggled,\n      and certain that she would never again be attractive; each twilight she\n      was afraid. She did not feel exalted, but unkempt and furious. The period\n      of daily sickness crawled into an endless time of boredom. It became\n      difficult for her to move about, and she raged that she, who had been slim\n      and light-footed, should have to lean on a stick, and be heartily\n      commented upon by street gossips. She was encircled by greasy eyes. Every\n      matron hinted, \"Now that you're going to be a mother, dearie, you'll get\n      over all these ideas of yours and settle down.\" She felt that willy-nilly\n      she was being initiated into the assembly of housekeepers; with the baby\n      for hostage, she would never escape; presently she would be drinking\n      coffee and rocking and talking about diapers.",
                "\"I could stand fighting them. I'm used to that. But this being taken in,\n      being taken as a matter of course, I can't stand it -- and I must stand\n      it!\"",
                "She alternately detested herself for not appreciating the kindly women,\n      and detested them for their advice: lugubrious hints as to how much she\n      would suffer in labor, details of baby-hygiene based on long experience\n      and total misunderstanding, superstitious cautions about the things she\n      must eat and read and look at in prenatal care for the baby's soul, and\n      always a pest of simpering baby-talk. Mrs. Champ Perry bustled in to lend\n      \"Ben Hur,\" as a preventive of future infant immorality. The Widow Bogart\n      appeared trailing pinkish exclamations, \"And how is our lovely 'ittle\n      muzzy today! My, ain't it just like they always say: being in a Family Way\n      does make the girlie so lovely, just like a Madonna. Tell me -- \" Her\n      whisper was tinged with salaciousness -- \"does oo feel the dear itsy\n      one stirring, the pledge of love? I remember with Cy, of course he was so\n      big --  -- \"",
                "\"I do not look lovely, Mrs. Bogart. My complexion is rotten, and my hair\n      is coming out, and I look like a potato-bag, and I think my arches are\n      falling, and he isn't a pledge of love, and I'm afraid he WILL look like\n      us, and I don't believe in mother-devotion, and the whole business is a\n      confounded nuisance of a biological process,\" remarked Carol.",
                "Then the baby was born, without unusual difficulty: a boy with straight\n      back and strong legs. The first day she hated him for the tides of pain\n      and hopeless fear he had caused; she resented his raw ugliness. After that\n      she loved him with all the devotion and instinct at which she had scoffed.\n      She marveled at the perfection of the miniature hands as noisily as did\n      Kennicott, she was overwhelmed by the trust with which the baby turned to\n      her; passion for him grew with each unpoetic irritating thing she had to\n      do for him.",
                "He was named Hugh, for her father.",
                "Hugh developed into a thin healthy child with a large head and straight\n      delicate hair of a faint brown. He was thoughtful and casual -- a\n      Kennicott.",
                "For two years nothing else existed. She did not, as the cynical matrons\n      had prophesied, \"give up worrying about the world and other folks' babies\n      soon as she got one of her own to fight for.\" The barbarity of that\n      willingness to sacrifice other children so that one child might have too\n      much was impossible to her. But she would sacrifice herself. She\n      understood consecration -- she who answered Kennicott's hints about\n      having Hugh christened: \"I refuse to insult my baby and myself by asking\n      an ignorant young man in a frock coat to sanction him, to permit me to\n      have him! I refuse to subject him to any devil-chasing rites! If I didn't\n      give my baby -- MY BABY -- enough sanctification in those nine hours\n      of hell, then he can't get any more out of the Reverend Mr. Zitterel!\"",
                "\"Well, Baptists hardly ever christen kids. I was kind of thinking more\n      about Reverend Warren,\" said Kennicott.",
                "Hugh was her reason for living, promise of accomplishment in the future,\n      shrine of adoration -- and a diverting toy. \"I thought I'd be a\n      dilettante mother, but I'm as dismayingly natural as Mrs. Bogart,\" she\n      boasted.",
                "For two -- years Carol was a part of the town; as much one of Our Young\n      Mothers as Mrs. McGanum. Her opinionation seemed dead; she had no apparent\n      desire for escape; her brooding centered on Hugh. While she wondered at\n      the pearl texture of his ear she exulted, \"I feel like an old woman, with\n      a skin like sandpaper, beside him, and I'm glad of it! He is perfect. He\n      shall have everything. He sha'n't always stay here in Gopher Prairie. . .\n      . I wonder which is really the best, Harvard or Yale or Oxford?\"",
                "II",
                "The people who hemmed her in had been brilliantly reinforced by Mr. and\n      Mrs. Whittier N. Smail -- Kennicott's Uncle Whittier and Aunt Bessie.",
                "The true Main Streetite defines a relative as a person to whose house you\n      go uninvited, to stay as long as you like. If you hear that Lym Cass on\n      his journey East has spent all his time \"visiting\" in Oyster Center, it\n      does not mean that he prefers that village to the rest of New England, but\n      that he has relatives there. It does not mean that he has written to the\n      relatives these many years, nor that they have ever given signs of a\n      desire to look upon him. But \"you wouldn't expect a man to go and spend\n      good money at a hotel in Boston, when his own third cousins live right in\n      the same state, would you?\"",
                "When the Smails sold their creamery in North Dakota they visited Mr.\n      Smail's sister, Kennicott's mother, at Lac-qui-Meurt, then plodded on to\n      Gopher Prairie to stay with their nephew. They appeared unannounced,\n      before the baby was born, took their welcome for granted, and immediately\n      began to complain of the fact that their room faced north.",
                "Uncle Whittier and Aunt Bessie assumed that it was their privilege as\n      relatives to laugh at Carol, and their duty as Christians to let her know\n      how absurd her \"notions\" were. They objected to the food, to Oscarina's\n      lack of friendliness, to the wind, the rain, and the immodesty of Carol's\n      maternity gowns. They were strong and enduring; for an hour at a time they\n      could go on heaving questions about her father's income, about her\n      theology, and about the reason why she had not put on her rubbers when she\n      had gone across the street. For fussy discussion they had a rich, full\n      genius, and their example developed in Kennicott a tendency to the same\n      form of affectionate flaying.",
                "If Carol was so indiscreet as to murmur that she had a small headache,\n      instantly the two Smails and Kennicott were at it. Every five minutes,\n      every time she sat down or rose or spoke to Oscarina, they twanged, \"Is\n      your head better now? Where does it hurt? Don't you keep hartshorn in the\n      house? Didn't you walk too far today? Have you tried hartshorn? Don't you\n      keep some in the house so it will be handy? Does it feel better now? How\n      does it feel? Do your eyes hurt, too? What time do you usually get to bed?\n      As late as THAT? Well! How does it feel now?\"",
                "In her presence Uncle Whittier snorted at Kennicott, \"Carol get these\n      headaches often? Huh? Be better for her if she didn't go gadding around to\n      all these bridge-whist parties, and took some care of herself once in a\n      while!\"",
                "They kept it up, commenting, questioning, commenting, questioning, till\n      her determination broke and she bleated, \"For heaven's SAKE, don't\n      dis-CUSS it! My head 's all RIGHT!\"",
                "She listened to the Smails and Kennicott trying to determine by dialectics\n      whether the copy of the Dauntless, which Aunt Bessie wanted to send to her\n      sister in Alberta, ought to have two or four cents postage on it. Carol\n      would have taken it to the drug store and weighed it, but then she was a\n      dreamer, while they were practical people (as they frequently admitted).\n      So they sought to evolve the postal rate from their inner consciousnesses,\n      which, combined with entire frankness in thinking aloud, was their method\n      of settling all problems.",
                "The Smails did not \"believe in all this nonsense\" about privacy and\n      reticence. When Carol left a letter from her sister on the table, she was\n      astounded to hear from Uncle Whittier, \"I see your sister says her husband\n      is doing fine. You ought to go see her oftener. I asked Will and he says\n      you don't go see her very often. My! You ought to go see her oftener!\"",
                "If Carol was writing a letter to a classmate, or planning the week's\n      menus, she could be certain that Aunt Bessie would pop in and titter, \"Now\n      don't let me disturb you, I just wanted to see where you were, don't stop,\n      I'm not going to stay only a second. I just wondered if you could possibly\n      have thought that I didn't eat the onions this noon because I didn't think\n      they were properly cooked, but that wasn't the reason at all, it wasn't\n      because I didn't think they were well cooked, I'm sure that everything in\n      your house is always very dainty and nice, though I do think that Oscarina\n      is careless about some things, she doesn't appreciate the big wages you\n      pay her, and she is so cranky, all these Swedes are so cranky, I don't\n      really see why you have a Swede, but --  -- But that wasn't it, I\n      didn't eat them not because I didn't think they weren't cooked proper, it\n      was just -- I find that onions don't agree with me, it's very strange,\n      ever since I had an attack of biliousness one time, I have found that\n      onions, either fried onions or raw ones, and Whittier does love raw onions\n      with vinegar and sugar on them --  -- \"",
                "It was pure affection.",
                "Carol was discovering that the one thing that can be more disconcerting\n      than intelligent hatred is demanding love.",
                "She supposed that she was being gracefully dull and standardized in the\n      Smails' presence, but they scented the heretic, and with forward-stooping\n      delight they sat and tried to drag out her ludicrous concepts for their\n      amusement. They were like the Sunday-afternoon mob starting at monkeys in\n      the Zoo, poking fingers and making faces and giggling at the resentment of\n      the more dignified race.",
                "With a loose-lipped, superior, village smile Uncle Whittier hinted,\n      \"What's this I hear about your thinking Gopher Prairie ought to be all\n      tore down and rebuilt, Carrie? I don't know where folks get these\n      new-fangled ideas. Lots of farmers in Dakota getting 'em these days. About\n      co-operation. Think they can run stores better 'n storekeepers! Huh!\"",
                "\"Whit and I didn't need no co-operation as long as we was farming!\"\n       triumphed Aunt Bessie. \"Carrie, tell your old auntie now: don't you ever\n      go to church on Sunday? You do go sometimes? But you ought to go every\n      Sunday! When you're as old as I am, you'll learn that no matter how smart\n      folks think they are, God knows a whole lot more than they do, and then\n      you'll realize and be glad to go and listen to your pastor!\"",
                "In the manner of one who has just beheld a two-headed calf they repeated\n      that they had \"never HEARD such funny ideas!\" They were staggered to learn\n      that a real tangible person, living in Minnesota, and married to their own\n      flesh-and-blood relation, could apparently believe that divorce may not\n      always be immoral; that illegitimate children do not bear any special and\n      guaranteed form of curse; that there are ethical authorities outside of\n      the Hebrew Bible; that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter;\n      that the capitalistic system of distribution and the Baptist\n      wedding-ceremony were not known in the Garden of Eden; that mushrooms are\n      as edible as corn-beef hash; that the word \"dude\" is no longer frequently\n      used; that there are Ministers of the Gospel who accept evolution; that\n      some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always\n      vote the Republican ticket straight; that it is not a universal custom to\n      wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter; that a violin is not\n      inherently more immoral than a chapel organ; that some poets do not have\n      long hair; and that Jews are not always pedlers or pants-makers.",
                "\"Where does she get all them the'ries?\" marveled Uncle Whittier Smail;\n      while Aunt Bessie inquired, \"Do you suppose there's many folks got notions\n      like hers? My! If there are,\" and her tone settled the fact that there\n      were not, \"I just don't know what the world's coming to!\"",
                "Patiently -- more or less -- Carol awaited the exquisite day when\n      they would announce departure. After three weeks Uncle Whittier remarked,\n      \"We kinda like Gopher Prairie. Guess maybe we'll stay here. We'd been\n      wondering what we'd do, now we've sold the creamery and my farms. So I had\n      a talk with Ole Jenson about his grocery, and I guess I'll buy him out and\n      storekeep for a while.\"",
                "He did.",
                "Carol rebelled. Kennicott soothed her: \"Oh, we won't see much of them.\n      They'll have their own house.\"",
                "She resolved to be so chilly that they would stay away. But she had no\n      talent for conscious insolence. They found a house, but Carol was never\n      safe from their appearance with a hearty, \"Thought we'd drop in this\n      evening and keep you from being lonely. Why, you ain't had them curtains\n      washed yet!\" Invariably, whenever she was touched by the realization that\n      it was they who were lonely, they wrecked her pitying affection by\n      comments -- questions -- comments -- advice.",
                "They immediately became friendly with all of their own race, with the Luke\n      Dawsons, the Deacon Piersons, and Mrs. Bogart; and brought them along in\n      the evening. Aunt Bessie was a bridge over whom the older women, bearing\n      gifts of counsel and the ignorance of experience, poured into Carol's\n      island of reserve. Aunt Bessie urged the good Widow Bogart, \"Drop in and\n      see Carrie real often. Young folks today don't understand housekeeping\n      like we do.\"",
                "Mrs. Bogart showed herself perfectly willing to be an associate relative.",
                "Carol was thinking up protective insults when Kennicott's mother came down\n      to stay with Brother Whittier for two months. Carol was fond of Mrs.\n      Kennicott. She could not carry out her insults.",
                "She felt trapped.",
                "She had been kidnaped by the town. She was Aunt Bessie's niece, and she\n      was to be a mother. She was expected, she almost expected herself, to sit\n      forever talking of babies, cooks, embroidery stitches, the price of\n      potatoes, and the tastes of husbands in the matter of spinach.",
                "She found a refuge in the Jolly Seventeen. She suddenly understood that\n      they could be depended upon to laugh with her at Mrs. Bogart, and she now\n      saw Juanita Haydock's gossip not as vulgarity but as gaiety and remarkable\n      analysis.",
                "Her life had changed, even before Hugh appeared. She looked forward to the\n      next bridge of the Jolly Seventeen, and the security of whispering with\n      her dear friends Maud Dyer and Juanita and Mrs. McGanum.",
                "She was part of the town. Its philosophy and its feuds dominated her.",
                "III",
                "She was no longer irritated by the cooing of the matrons, nor by their\n      opinion that diet didn't matter so long as the Little Ones had plenty of\n      lace and moist kisses, but she concluded that in the care of babies as in\n      politics, intelligence was superior to quotations about pansies. She liked\n      best to talk about Hugh to Kennicott, Vida, and the Bjornstams. She was\n      happily domestic when Kennicott sat by her on the floor, to watch baby\n      make faces. She was delighted when Miles, speaking as one man to another,\n      admonished Hugh, \"I wouldn't stand them skirts if I was you. Come on. Join\n      the union and strike. Make 'em give you pants.\"",
                "As a parent, Kennicott was moved to establish the first child-welfare week\n      held in Gopher Prairie. Carol helped him weigh babies and examine their\n      throats, and she wrote out the diets for mute German and Scandinavian\n      mothers.",
                "The aristocracy of Gopher Prairie, even the wives of the rival doctors,\n      took part, and for several days there was community spirit and much\n      uplift. But this reign of love was overthrown when the prize for Best Baby\n      was awarded not to decent parents but to Bea and Miles Bjornstam! The good\n      matrons glared at Olaf Bjornstam, with his blue eyes, his honey-colored\n      hair, and magnificent back, and they remarked, \"Well, Mrs. Kennicott,\n      maybe that Swede brat is as healthy as your husband says he is, but let me\n      tell you I hate to think of the future that awaits any boy with a hired\n      girl for a mother and an awful irreligious socialist for a pa!\"",
                "She raged, but so violent was the current of their respectability, so\n      persistent was Aunt Bessie in running to her with their blabber, that she\n      was embarrassed when she took Hugh to play with Olaf. She hated herself\n      for it, but she hoped that no one saw her go into the Bjornstam shanty.\n      She hated herself and the town's indifferent cruelty when she saw Bea's\n      radiant devotion to both babies alike; when she saw Miles staring at them\n      wistfully.",
                "He had saved money, had quit Elder's planing-mill and started a dairy on a\n      vacant lot near his shack. He was proud of his three cows and sixty\n      chickens, and got up nights to nurse them.",
                "\"I'll be a big farmer before you can bat an eye! I tell you that young\n      fellow Olaf is going to go East to college along with the Haydock kids. Uh --  -- Lots\n      of folks dropping in to chin with Bea and me now. Say! Ma Bogart come in\n      one day! She was --  -- I liked the old lady fine. And the mill\n      foreman comes in right along. Oh, we got lots of friends. You bet!\"",
                "IV",
                "Though the town seemed to Carol to change no more than the surrounding\n      fields, there was a constant shifting, these three years. The citizen of\n      the prairie drifts always westward. It may be because he is the heir of\n      ancient migrations -- and it may be because he finds within his own\n      spirit so little adventure that he is driven to seek it by changing his\n      horizon. The towns remain unvaried, yet the individual faces alter like\n      classes in college. The Gopher Prairie jeweler sells out, for no\n      discernible reason, and moves on to Alberta or the state of Washington, to\n      open a shop precisely like his former one, in a town precisely like the\n      one he has left. There is, except among professional men and the wealthy,\n      small permanence either of residence or occupation. A man becomes farmer,\n      grocer, town policeman, garageman, restaurant-owner, postmaster,\n      insurance-agent, and farmer all over again, and the community more or less\n      patiently suffers from his lack of knowledge in each of his experiments.",
                "Ole Jenson the grocer and Dahl the butcher moved on to South Dakota and\n      Idaho. Luke and Mrs. Dawson picked up ten thousand acres of prairie soil,\n      in the magic portable form of a small check book, and went to Pasadena, to\n      a bungalow and sunshine and cafeterias. Chet Dashaway sold his furniture\n      and undertaking business and wandered to Los Angeles, where, the Dauntless\n      reported, \"Our good friend Chester has accepted a fine position with a\n      real-estate firm, and his wife has in the charming social circles of the\n      Queen City of the Southwestland that same popularity which she enjoyed in\n      our own society sets.\"",
                "Rita Simons was married to Terry Gould, and rivaled Juanita Haydock as the\n      gayest of the Young Married Set. But Juanita also acquired merit. Harry's\n      father died, Harry became senior partner in the Bon Ton Store, and Juanita\n      was more acidulous and shrewd and cackling than ever. She bought an\n      evening frock, and exposed her collar-bone to the wonder of the Jolly\n      Seventeen, and talked of moving to Minneapolis.",
                "To defend her position against the new Mrs. Terry Gould she sought to\n      attach Carol to her faction by giggling that \"SOME folks might call Rita\n      innocent, but I've got a hunch that she isn't half as ignorant of things\n      as brides are supposed to be -- and of course Terry isn't one-two-three\n      as a doctor alongside of your husband.\"",
                "Carol herself would gladly have followed Mr. Ole Jenson, and migrated even\n      to another Main Street; flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would\n      have for a time the outer look and promise of adventure. She hinted to\n      Kennicott of the probable medical advantages of Montana and Oregon. She\n      knew that he was satisfied with Gopher Prairie, but it gave her vicarious\n      hope to think of going, to ask for railroad folders at the station, to\n      trace the maps with a restless forefinger.",
                "Yet to the casual eye she was not discontented, she was not an abnormal\n      and distressing traitor to the faith of Main Street.",
                "The settled citizen believes that the rebel is constantly in a stew of\n      complaining and, hearing of a Carol Kennicott, he gasps, \"What an awful\n      person! She must be a Holy Terror to live with! Glad MY folks are\n      satisfied with things way they are!\" Actually, it was not so much as five\n      minutes a day that Carol devoted to lonely desires. It is probable that\n      the agitated citizen has within his circle at least one inarticulate rebel\n      with aspirations as wayward as Carol's.",
                "The presence of the baby had made her take Gopher Prairie and the brown\n      house seriously, as natural places of residence. She pleased Kennicott by\n      being friendly with the complacent maturity of Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Elder,\n      and when she had often enough been in conference upon the Elders' new\n      Cadillac car, or the job which the oldest Clark boy had taken in the\n      office of the flour-mill, these topics became important, things to follow\n      up day by day.",
                "With nine-tenths of her emotion concentrated upon Hugh, she did not\n      criticize shops, streets, acquaintances . . . this year or two. She\n      hurried to Uncle Whittier's store for a package of corn-flakes, she\n      abstractedly listened to Uncle Whittier's denunciation of Martin Mahoney\n      for asserting that the wind last Tuesday had been south and not southwest,\n      she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces\n      of strangers. Thinking of Hugh's teething all the way, she did not reflect\n      that this store, these drab blocks, made up all her background. She did\n      her work, and she triumphed over winning from the Clarks at five hundred.",
                "The most considerable event of the two years after the birth of Hugh\n      occurred when Vida Sherwin resigned from the high school and was married.\n      Carol was her attendant, and as the wedding was at the Episcopal Church,\n      all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid gloves, and looked\n      refined.",
                "For years Carol had been little sister to Vida, and had never in the least\n      known to what degree Vida loved her and hated her and in curious strained\n      ways was bound to her."

                "She was small and active and sallow; her yellow hair was faded, and looked\n      dry; her blue silk blouses and modest lace collars and high black shoes\n      and sailor hats were as literal and uncharming as a schoolroom desk; but\n      her eyes determined her appearance, revealed her as a personage and a\n      force, indicated her faith in the goodness and purpose of everything. They\n      were blue, and they were never still; they expressed amusement, pity,\n      enthusiasm. If she had been seen in sleep, with the wrinkles beside her\n      eyes stilled and the creased lids hiding the radiant irises, she would\n      have lost her potency.",
                "She was born in a hill-smothered Wisconsin village where her father was a\n      prosy minister; she labored through a sanctimonious college; she taught\n      for two years in an iron-range town of blurry-faced Tatars and\n      Montenegrins, and wastes of ore, and when she came to Gopher Prairie, its\n      trees and the shining spaciousness of the wheat prairie made her certain\n      that she was in paradise.",
                "She admitted to her fellow-teachers that the schoolbuilding was slightly\n      damp, but she insisted that the rooms were \"arranged so conveniently -- and\n      then that bust of President McKinley at the head of the stairs, it's a\n      lovely art-work, and isn't it an inspiration to have the brave, honest,\n      martyr president to think about!\" She taught French, English, and history,\n      and the Sophomore Latin class, which dealt in matters of a metaphysical\n      nature called Indirect Discourse and the Ablative Absolute. Each year she\n      was reconvinced that the pupils were beginning to learn more quickly. She\n      spent four winters in building up the Debating Society, and when the\n      debate really was lively one Friday afternoon, and the speakers of pieces\n      did not forget their lines, she felt rewarded.",
                "She lived an engrossed useful life, and seemed as cool and simple as an\n      apple. But secretly she was creeping among fears, longing, and guilt. She\n      knew what it was, but she dared not name it. She hated even the sound of\n      the word \"sex.\" When she dreamed of being a woman of the harem, with great\n      white warm limbs, she awoke to shudder, defenseless in the dusk of her\n      room. She prayed to Jesus, always to the Son of God, offering him the\n      terrible power of her adoration, addressing him as the eternal lover,\n      growing passionate, exalted, large, as she contemplated his splendor. Thus\n      she mounted to endurance and surcease.",
                "By day, rattling about in many activities, she was able to ridicule her\n      blazing nights of darkness. With spurious cheerfulness she announced\n      everywhere, \"I guess I'm a born spinster,\" and \"No one will ever marry a\n      plain schoolma'am like me,\" and \"You men, great big noisy bothersome\n      creatures, we women wouldn't have you round the place, dirtying up nice\n      clean rooms, if it wasn't that you have to be petted and guided. We just\n      ought to say 'Scat!' to all of you!\"",
                "But when a man held her close at a dance, even when \"Professor\" George\n      Edwin Mott patted her hand paternally as they considered the naughtinesses\n      of Cy Bogart, she quivered, and reflected how superior she was to have\n      kept her virginity.",
                "In the autumn of 1911, a year before Dr. Will Kennicott was married, Vida\n      was his partner at a five-hundred tournament. She was thirty-four then;\n      Kennicott about thirty-six. To her he was a superb, boyish, diverting\n      creature; all the heroic qualities in a manly magnificent body. They had\n      been helping the hostess to serve the Waldorf salad and coffee and\n      gingerbread. They were in the kitchen, side by side on a bench, while the\n      others ponderously supped in the room beyond.",
                "Kennicott was masculine and experimental. He stroked Vida's hand, he put\n      his arm carelessly about her shoulder.",
                "\"Don't!\" she said sharply.",
                "\"You're a cunning thing,\" he offered, patting the back of her shoulder in\n      an exploratory manner.",
                "While she strained away, she longed to move nearer to him. He bent over,\n      looked at her knowingly. She glanced down at his left hand as it touched\n      her knee. She sprang up, started noisily and needlessly to wash the\n      dishes. He helped her. He was too lazy to adventure further -- and too\n      used to women in his profession. She was grateful for the impersonality of\n      his talk. It enabled her to gain control. She knew that she had skirted\n      wild thoughts.",
                "A month after, on a sleighing-party, under the buffalo robes in the\n      bob-sled, he whispered, \"You pretend to be a grown-up schoolteacher, but\n      you're nothing but a kiddie.\" His arm was about her. She resisted.",
                "\"Don't you like the poor lonely bachelor?\" he yammered in a fatuous way.",
                "\"No, I don't! You don't care for me in the least. You're just practising\n      on me.\"",
                "\"You're so mean! I'm terribly fond of you.\"",
                "\"I'm not of you. And I'm not going to let myself be fond of you, either.\"",
                "He persistently drew her toward him. She clutched his arm. Then she threw\n      off the robe, climbed out of the sled, raced after it with Harry Haydock.\n      At the dance which followed the sleigh-ride Kennicott was devoted to the\n      watery prettiness of Maud Dyer, and Vida was noisily interested in getting\n      up a Virginia Reel. Without seeming to watch Kennicott, she knew that he\n      did not once look at her.",
                "That was all of her first love-affair.",
                "He gave no sign of remembering that he was \"terribly fond.\" She waited for\n      him; she reveled in longing, and in a sense of guilt because she longed.\n      She told herself that she did not want part of him; unless he gave her all\n      his devotion she would never let him touch her; and when she found that\n      she was probably lying, she burned with scorn. She fought it out in\n      prayer. She knelt in a pink flannel nightgown, her thin hair down her\n      back, her forehead as full of horror as a mask of tragedy, while she\n      identified her love for the Son of God with her love for a mortal, and\n      wondered if any other woman had ever been so sacrilegious. She wanted to\n      be a nun and observe perpetual adoration. She bought a rosary, but she had\n      been so bitterly reared as a Protestant that she could not bring herself\n      to use it.",
                "Yet none of her intimates in the school and in the boarding-house knew of\n      her abyss of passion. They said she was \"so optimistic.\"",
                "When she heard that Kennicott was to marry a girl, pretty, young, and\n      imposingly from the Cities, Vida despaired. She congratulated Kennicott;\n      carelessly ascertained from him the hour of marriage. At that hour,\n      sitting in her room, Vida pictured the wedding in St. Paul. Full of an\n      ecstasy which horrified her, she followed Kennicott and the girl who had\n      stolen her place, followed them to the train, through the evening, the\n      night.",
                "She was relieved when she had worked out a belief that she wasn't really\n      shameful, that there was a mystical relation between herself and Carol, so\n      that she was vicariously yet veritably with Kennicott, and had the right\n      to be.",
                "She saw Carol during the first five minutes in Gopher Prairie. She stared\n      at the passing motor, at Kennicott and the girl beside him. In that fog\n      world of transference of emotion Vida had no normal jealousy but a\n      conviction that, since through Carol she had received Kennicott's love,\n      then Carol was a part of her, an astral self, a heightened and more\n      beloved self. She was glad of the girl's charm, of the smooth black hair,\n      the airy head and young shoulders. But she was suddenly angry. Carol\n      glanced at her for a quarter-second, but looked past her, at an old\n      roadside barn. If she had made the great sacrifice, at least she expected\n      gratitude and recognition, Vida raged, while her conscious schoolroom mind\n      fussily begged her to control this insanity.",
                "During her first call half of her wanted to welcome a fellow reader of\n      books; the other half itched to find out whether Carol knew anything about\n      Kennicott's former interest in herself. She discovered that Carol was not\n      aware that he had ever touched another woman's hand. Carol was an amusing,\n      naive, curiously learned child. While Vida was most actively describing\n      the glories of the Thanatopsis, and complimenting this librarian on her\n      training as a worker, she was fancying that this girl was the child born\n      of herself and Kennicott; and out of that symbolizing she had a comfort\n      she had not known for months.",
                "When she came home, after supper with the Kennicotts and Guy Pollock, she\n      had a sudden and rather pleasant backsliding from devotion. She bustled\n      into her room, she slammed her hat on the bed, and chattered, \"I don't\n      CARE! I'm a lot like her -- except a few years older. I'm light and\n      quick, too, and I can talk just as well as she can, and I'm sure --  -- Men\n      are such fools. I'd be ten times as sweet to make love to as that dreamy\n      baby. And I AM as good-looking!\"",
                "But as she sat on the bed and stared at her thin thighs, defiance oozed\n      away. She mourned:",
                "\"No. I'm not. Dear God, how we fool ourselves! I pretend I'm 'spiritual.'\n      I pretend my legs are graceful. They aren't. They're skinny. Old-maidish.\n      I hate it! I hate that impertinent young woman! A selfish cat, taking his\n      love for granted. . . . No, she's adorable. . . . I don't think she ought\n      to be so friendly with Guy Pollock.\"",
                "For a year Vida loved Carol, longed to and did not pry into the details of\n      her relations with Kennicott, enjoyed her spirit of play as expressed in\n      childish tea-parties, and, with the mystic bond between them forgotten,\n      was healthily vexed by Carol's assumption that she was a sociological\n      messiah come to save Gopher Prairie. This last facet of Vida's thought was\n      the one which, after a year, was most often turned to the light. In a\n      testy way she brooded, \"These people that want to change everything all of\n      a sudden without doing any work, make me tired! Here I have to go and work\n      for four years, picking out the pupils for debates, and drilling them, and\n      nagging at them to get them to look up references, and begging them to\n      choose their own subjects -- four years, to get up a couple of good\n      debates! And she comes rushing in, and expects in one year to change the\n      whole town into a lollypop paradise with everybody stopping everything\n      else to grow tulips and drink tea. And it's a comfy homey old town, too!\"",
                "She had such an outburst after each of Carol's campaigns -- for better\n      Thanatopsis programs, for Shavian plays, for more human schools -- but\n      she never betrayed herself, and always she was penitent.",
                "Vida was, and always would be, a reformer, a liberal. She believed that\n      details could excitingly be altered, but that things-in-general were\n      comely and kind and immutable. Carol was, without understanding or\n      accepting it, a revolutionist, a radical, and therefore possessed of\n      \"constructive ideas,\" which only the destroyer can have, since the\n      reformer believes that all the essential constructing has already been\n      done. After years of intimacy it was this unexpressed opposition more than\n      the fancied loss of Kennicott's love which held Vida irritably fascinated.",
                "But the birth of Hugh revived the transcendental emotion. She was\n      indignant that Carol should not be utterly fulfilled in having borne\n      Kennicott's child. She admitted that Carol seemed to have affection and\n      immaculate care for the baby, but she began to identify herself now with\n      Kennicott, and in this phase to feel that she had endured quite too much\n      from Carol's instability.",
                "She recalled certain other women who had come from the Outside and had not\n      appreciated Gopher Prairie. She remembered the rector's wife who had been\n      chilly to callers and who was rumored throughout the town to have said,\n      \"Re-ah-ly I cawn't endure this bucolic heartiness in the responses.\" The\n      woman was positively known to have worn handkerchiefs in her bodice as\n      padding -- oh, the town had simply roared at her. Of course the rector\n      and she were got rid of in a few months.",
                "Then there was the mysterious woman with the dyed hair and penciled\n      eyebrows, who wore tight English dresses, like basques, who smelled of\n      stale musk, who flirted with the men and got them to advance money for her\n      expenses in a lawsuit, who laughed at Vida's reading at a\n      school-entertainment, and went off owing a hotel-bill and the three\n      hundred dollars she had borrowed.",
                "Vida insisted that she loved Carol, but with some satisfaction she\n      compared her to these traducers of the town.",
                "II",
                "Vida had enjoyed Raymie Wutherspoon's singing in the Episcopal choir; she\n      had thoroughly reviewed the weather with him at Methodist sociables and in\n      the Bon Ton. But she did not really know him till she moved to Mrs.\n      Gurrey's boarding-house. It was five years after her affair with\n      Kennicott. She was thirty-nine, Raymie perhaps a year younger.",
                "She said to him, and sincerely, \"My! You can do anything, with your brains\n      and tact and that heavenly voice. You were so good in 'The Girl from\n      Kankakee.' You made me feel terribly stupid. If you'd gone on the stage, I\n      believe you'd be just as good as anybody in Minneapolis. But still, I'm\n      not sorry you stuck to business. It's such a constructive career.\"",
                "\"Do you really think so?\" yearned Raymie, across the apple-sauce.",
                "It was the first time that either of them had found a dependable\n      intellectual companionship. They looked down on Willis Woodford the\n      bank-clerk, and his anxious babycentric wife, the silent Lyman Casses, the\n      slangy traveling man, and the rest of Mrs. Gurrey's unenlightened guests.\n      They sat opposite, and they sat late. They were exhilarated to find that\n      they agreed in confession of faith:",
                "\"People like Sam Clark and Harry Haydock aren't earnest about music and\n      pictures and eloquent sermons and really refined movies, but then, on the\n      other hand, people like Carol Kennicott put too much stress on all this\n      art. Folks ought to appreciate lovely things, but just the same, they got\n      to be practical and -- they got to look at things in a practical way.\"",
                "Smiling, passing each other the pressed-glass pickle-dish, seeing Mrs.\n      Gurrey's linty supper-cloth irradiated by the light of intimacy, Vida and\n      Raymie talked about Carol's rose-colored turban, Carol's sweetness,\n      Carol's new low shoes, Carol's erroneous theory that there was no need of\n      strict discipline in school, Carol's amiability in the Bon Ton, Carol's\n      flow of wild ideas, which, honestly, just simply made you nervous trying\n      to keep track of them.",
                "About the lovely display of gents' shirts in the Bon Ton window as dressed\n      by Raymie, about Raymie's offertory last Sunday, the fact that there\n      weren't any of these new solos as nice as \"Jerusalem the Golden,\" and the\n      way Raymie stood up to Juanita Haydock when she came into the store and\n      tried to run things and he as much as told her that she was so anxious to\n      have folks think she was smart and bright that she said things she didn't\n      mean, and anyway, Raymie was running the shoe-department, and if Juanita,\n      or Harry either, didn't like the way he ran things, they could go get\n      another man.",
                "About Vida's new jabot which made her look thirty-two (Vida's estimate) or\n      twenty-two (Raymie's estimate), Vida's plan to have the high-school\n      Debating Society give a playlet, and the difficulty of keeping the younger\n      boys well behaved on the playground when a big lubber like Cy Bogart acted\n      up so.",
                "About the picture post-card which Mrs. Dawson had sent to Mrs. Cass from\n      Pasadena, showing roses growing right outdoors in February, the change in\n      time on No. 4, the reckless way Dr. Gould always drove his auto, the\n      reckless way almost all these people drove their autos, the fallacy of\n      supposing that these socialists could carry on a government for as much as\n      six months if they ever did have a chance to try out their theories, and\n      the crazy way in which Carol jumped from subject to subject.",
                "Vida had once beheld Raymie as a thin man with spectacles, mournful\n      drawn-out face, and colorless stiff hair. Now she noted that his jaw was\n      square, that his long hands moved quickly and were bleached in a refined\n      manner, and that his trusting eyes indicated that he had \"led a clean\n      life.\" She began to call him \"Ray,\" and to bounce in defense of his\n      unselfishness and thoughtfulness every time Juanita Haydock or Rita Gould\n      giggled about him at the Jolly Seventeen.",
                "On a Sunday afternoon of late autumn they walked down to Lake\n      Minniemashie. Ray said that he would like to see the ocean; it must be a\n      grand sight; it must be much grander than a lake, even a great big lake.\n      Vida had seen it, she stated modestly; she had seen it on a summer trip to\n      Cape Cod.",

                "\"No, not very. I wish there was a Y. M. C. A. here, so I could take up\n      regular exercise. I used to think I could do pretty good acrobatics, if I\n      had a chance.\"",
                "\"I'm sure you could. You're unusually lithe, for a large man.\"",
                "\"Oh no, not so very. But I wish we had a Y. M. It would be dandy to have\n      lectures and everything, and I'd like to take a class in improving the\n      memory -- I believe a fellow ought to go on educating himself and\n      improving his mind even if he is in business, don't you, Vida -- I\n      guess I'm kind of fresh to call you 'Vida'!\"",

Tell me about your plan for\n      getting a partnership in the Bon Ton. I do think you're right: Harry\n      Haydock and that mean old Simons ought to give you one.\"",
                "He hymned the old unhappy wars in which he had been Achilles and the\n      mellifluous Nestor, yet gone his righteous ways unheeded by the cruel\n      kings. . . . \"Why, if I've told 'em once, I've told 'em a dozen times to\n      get in a side-line of light-weight pants for gents' summer wear, and of\n      course here they go and let a cheap kike like Rifkin beat them to it and\n      grab the trade right off 'em, and then Harry said -- you know how Harry\n      is, maybe he don't mean to be grouchy, but he's such a sore-head --  -- \"",
                "He gave her a hand to rise. \"If you don't MIND. I think a fellow is awful\n      if a lady goes on a walk with him and she can't trust him and he tries to\n      flirt with her and all.\"",

She persuaded him not\n      to wear the small bow ties which made him look like an elongated Sunday\n      School scholar. Once she burst out:",
                "\"Ray, I could shake you! Do you know you're too apologetic? You always\n      appreciate other people too much. You fuss over Carol Kennicott when she\n      has some crazy theory that we all ought to turn anarchists or live on figs\n      and nuts or something. And you listen when Harry Haydock tries to show off\n      and talk about turnovers and credits and things you know lots better than\n      he does. Look folks in the eye! Glare at 'em! Talk deep! You're the\n      smartest man in town, if you only knew it. You ARE!\"",
                "He could not believe it. He kept coming back to her for confirmation. He\n      practised glaring and talking deep, but he circuitously hinted to Vida\n      that when he had tried to look Harry Haydock in the eye, Harry had\n      inquired, \"What's the matter with you, Raymie? Got a pain?\" But afterward\n      Harry had asked about Kantbeatum socks in a manner which, Ray felt, was\n      somehow different from his former condescension.",

                "She sprang up, ignoring his wail of \"Vida! Wait! Sit down! Gosh! I'm\n      flabbergasted! Gee! Vida!\" She marched out. While he was paying his check\n      she got ahead. He ran after her, blubbering, \"Vida! Wait!\" In the shade of\n      the lilacs in front of the Gougerling house he came up with her, stayed\n      her flight by a hand on her shoulder.",
                "\"Oh, don't! Don't! What does it matter?\" she begged. She was sobbing, her\n      soft wrinkly lids soaked with tears. \"Who cares for my affection or help?\n      I might as well drift on, forgotten. O Ray, please don't hold me. Let me\n      go. I'll just decide not to renew my contract here, and -- and drift -- way\n      off --  -- \"",
                "His hand was steady on her shoulder. She dropped her head, rubbed the back\n      of his hand with her cheek.",

                "Though she became Vida Wutherspoon technically, and though she certainly\n      had no ideals about the independence of keeping her name, she continued to\n      be known as Vida Sherwin.",
                "She had resigned from the school, but she kept up one class in English.\n      She bustled about on every committee of the Thanatopsis; she was always\n      popping into the rest-room to make Mrs. Nodelquist sweep the floor; she\n      was appointed to the library-board to succeed Carol; she taught the Senior\n      Girls' Class in the Episcopal Sunday School, and tried to revive the\n      King's Daughters. She exploded into self-confidence and happiness; her\n      draining thoughts were by marriage turned into energy. She became daily\n      and visibly more plump, and though she chattered as eagerly, she was less\n      obviously admiring of marital bliss, less sentimental about babies,\n      sharper in demanding that the entire town share her reforms -- the\n      purchase of a park, the compulsory cleaning of back-yards.",
                "She penned Harry Haydock at his desk in the Bon Ton; she interrupted his\n      joking; she told him that it was Ray who had built up the shoe-department\n      and men's department; she demanded that he be made a partner. Before Harry\n      could answer she threatened that Ray and she would start a rival shop.\n      \"I'll clerk behind the counter myself, and a Certain Party is all ready to\n      put up the money.\"",
                "She rather wondered who the Certain Party was.",
                "Ray was made a one-sixth partner.",
                "He became a glorified floor-walker, greeting the men with new poise, no\n      longer coyly subservient to pretty women. When he was not affectionately\n      coercing people into buying things they did not need, he stood at the back\n      of the store, glowing, abstracted, feeling masculine as he recalled the\n      tempestuous surprises of love revealed by Vida.",
                "The only remnant of Vida's identification of herself with Carol was a\n      jealousy when she saw Kennicott and Ray together, and reflected that some\n      people might suppose that Kennicott was his superior. She was sure that\n      Carol thought so, and she wanted to shriek, \"You needn't try to gloat! I\n      wouldn't have your pokey old husband. He hasn't one single bit of Ray's\n      spiritual nobility.\""

                "THE greatest mystery about a human being is not his reaction to sex or\n      praise, but the manner in which he contrives to put in twenty-four hours a\n      day. It is this which puzzles the long-shoreman about the clerk, the\n      Londoner about the bushman. It was this which puzzled Carol in regard to\n      the married Vida. Carol herself had the baby, a larger house to care for,\n      all the telephone calls for Kennicott when he was away; and she read\n      everything, while Vida was satisfied with newspaper headlines.",
                "But after detached brown years in boarding-houses, Vida was hungry for\n      housework, for the most pottering detail of it. She had no maid, nor\n      wanted one. She cooked, baked, swept, washed supper-cloths, with the\n      triumph of a chemist in a new laboratory. To her the hearth was veritably\n      the altar. When she went shopping she hugged the cans of soup, and she\n      bought a mop or a side of bacon as though she were preparing for a\n      reception. She knelt beside a bean sprout and crooned, \"I raised this with\n      my own hands -- I brought this new life into the world.\"",
                "\"I love her for being so happy,\" Carol brooded. \"I ought to be that way. I\n      worship the baby, but the housework --  -- Oh, I suppose I'm\n      fortunate; so much better off than farm-women on a new clearing, or people\n      in a slum.\"",
                "It has not yet been recorded that any human being has gained a very large\n      or permanent contentment from meditation upon the fact that he is better\n      off than others.",
                "In Carol's own twenty-four hours a day she got up, dressed the baby, had\n      breakfast, talked to Oscarina about the day's shopping, put the baby on\n      the porch to play, went to the butcher's to choose between steak and pork\n      chops, bathed the baby, nailed up a shelf, had dinner, put the baby to bed\n      for a nap, paid the iceman, read for an hour, took the baby out for a\n      walk, called on Vida, had supper, put the baby to bed, darned socks,\n      listened to Kennicott's yawning comment on what a fool Dr. McGanum was to\n      try to use that cheap X-ray outfit of his on an epithelioma, repaired a\n      frock, drowsily heard Kennicott stoke the furnace, tried to read a page of\n      Thorstein Veblen -- and the day was gone.",
                "Except when Hugh was vigorously naughty, or whiney, or laughing, or saying\n      \"I like my chair\" with thrilling maturity, she was always enfeebled by\n      loneliness. She no longer felt superior about that misfortune. She would\n      gladly have been converted to Vida's satisfaction in Gopher Prairie and\n      mopping the floor.",
                "II",
                "Carol drove through an astonishing number of books from the public library\n      and from city shops. Kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her\n      disconcerting habit of buying them. A book was a book, and if you had\n      several thousand of them right here in the library, free, why the dickens\n      should you spend your good money? After worrying about it for two or three\n      years, he decided that this was one of the Funny Ideas which she had\n      caught as a librarian and from which she would never entirely recover.",
                "The authors whom she read were most of them frightfully annoyed by the\n      Vida Sherwins. They were young American sociologists, young English\n      realists, Russian horrorists; Anatole France, Rolland, Nexo, Wells, Shaw,\n      Key, Edgar Lee Masters, Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Henry\n      Mencken, and all the other subversive philosophers and artists whom women\n      were consulting everywhere, in batik-curtained studios in New York, in\n      Kansas farmhouses, San Francisco drawing-rooms, Alabama schools for\n      negroes. From them she got the same confused desire which the million\n      other women felt; the same determination to be class-conscious without\n      discovering the class of which she was to be conscious.",
                "Certainly her reading precipitated her observations of Main Street, of\n      Gopher Prairie and of the several adjacent Gopher Prairies which she had\n      seen on drives with Kennicott. In her fluid thought certain convictions\n      appeared, jaggedly, a fragment of an impression at a time, while she was\n      going to sleep, or manicuring her nails, or waiting for Kennicott.",
                "These convictions she presented to Vida Sherwin -- Vida Wutherspoon -- beside\n      a radiator, over a bowl of not very good walnuts and pecans from Uncle\n      Whittier's grocery, on an evening when both Kennicott and Raymie had gone\n      out of town with the other officers of the Ancient and Affiliated Order of\n      Spartans, to inaugurate a new chapter at Wakamin. Vida had come to the\n      house for the night. She helped in putting Hugh to bed, sputtering the\n      while about his soft skin. Then they talked till midnight.",
                "What Carol said that evening, what she was passionately thinking, was also\n      emerging in the minds of women in ten thousand Gopher Prairies. Her\n      formulations were not pat solutions but visions of a tragic futility. She\n      did not utter them so compactly that they can be given in her words; they\n      were roughened with \"Well, you see\" and \"if you get what I mean\" and \"I\n      don't know that I'm making myself clear.\" But they were definite enough,\n      and indignant enough.",
                "III",
                "In reading popular stories and seeing plays, asserted Carol, she had found\n      only two traditions of the American small town. The first tradition,\n      repeated in scores of magazines every month, is that the American village\n      remains the one sure abode of friendship, honesty, and clean sweet\n      marriageable girls. Therefore all men who succeed in painting in Paris or\n      in finance in New York at last become weary of smart women, return to\n      their native towns, assert that cities are vicious, marry their childhood\n      sweethearts and, presumably, joyously abide in those towns until death.",
                "The other tradition is that the significant features of all villages are\n      whiskers, iron dogs upon lawns, gold bricks, checkers, jars of gilded\n      cat-tails, and shrewd comic old men who are known as \"hicks\" and who\n      ejaculate \"Waal I swan.\" This altogether admirable tradition rules the\n      vaudeville stage, facetious illustrators, and syndicated newspaper humor,\n      but out of actual life it passed forty years ago. Carol's small town\n      thinks not in hoss-swapping but in cheap motor cars, telephones,\n      ready-made clothes, silos, alfalfa, kodaks, phonographs,\n      leather-upholstered Morris chairs, bridge-prizes, oil-stocks,\n      motion-pictures, land-deals, unread sets of Mark Twain, and a chaste\n      version of national politics.",
                "With such a small-town life a Kennicott or a Champ Perry is content, but\n      there are also hundreds of thousands, particularly women and young men,\n      who are not at all content. The more intelligent young people (and the\n      fortunate widows!) flee to the cities with agility and, despite the\n      fictional tradition, resolutely stay there, seldom returning even for\n      holidays. The most protesting patriots of the towns leave them in old age,\n      if they can afford it, and go to live in California or in the cities.",
                "The reason, Carol insisted, is not a whiskered rusticity. It is nothing so\n      amusing!",
                "It is an unimaginatively standardized background, a sluggishness of speech\n      and manners, a rigid ruling of the spirit by the desire to appear\n      respectable. It is contentment . . . the contentment of the quiet dead,\n      who are scornful of the living for their restless walking. It is negation\n      canonized as the one positive virtue. It is the prohibition of happiness.\n      It is slavery self-sought and self-defended. It is dullness made God.",
                "A savorless people, gulping tasteless food, and sitting afterward,\n      coatless and thoughtless, in rocking-chairs prickly with inane\n      decorations, listening to mechanical music, saying mechanical things about\n      the excellence of Ford automobiles, and viewing themselves as the greatest\n      race in the world.",
                "IV",
                "She had inquired as to the effect of this dominating dullness upon\n      foreigners. She remembered the feeble exotic quality to be found in the\n      first-generation Scandinavians; she recalled the Norwegian Fair at the\n      Lutheran Church, to which Bea had taken her. There, in the bondestue, the\n      replica of a Norse farm kitchen, pale women in scarlet jackets embroidered\n      with gold thread and colored beads, in black skirts with a line of blue,\n      green-striped aprons, and ridged caps very pretty to set off a fresh face,\n      had served rommegrod og lefse -- sweet cakes and sour milk pudding\n      spiced with cinnamon. For the first time in Gopher Prairie Carol had found\n      novelty. She had reveled in the mild foreignness of it.",
                "But she saw these Scandinavian women zealously exchanging their spiced\n      puddings and red jackets for fried pork chops and congealed white blouses,\n      trading the ancient Christmas hymns of the fjords for \"She's My Jazzland\n      Cutie,\" being Americanized into uniformity, and in less than a generation\n      losing in the grayness whatever pleasant new customs they might have added\n      to the life of the town. Their sons finished the process. In ready-made\n      clothes and ready-made high-school phrases they sank into propriety, and\n      the sound American customs had absorbed without one trace of pollution\n      another alien invasion.",
                "And along with these foreigners, she felt herself being ironed into glossy\n      mediocrity, and she rebelled, in fear.",
                "The respectability of the Gopher Prairies, said Carol, is reinforced by\n      vows of poverty and chastity in the matter of knowledge. Except for half a\n      dozen in each town the citizens are proud of that achievement of ignorance\n      which it is so easy to come by. To be \"intellectual\" or \"artistic\" or, in\n      their own word, to be \"highbrow,\" is to be priggish and of dubious virtue.",
                "Large experiments in politics and in co-operative distribution, ventures\n      requiring knowledge, courage, and imagination, do originate in the West\n      and Middlewest, but they are not of the towns, they are of the farmers. If\n      these heresies are supported by the townsmen it is only by occasional\n      teachers doctors, lawyers, the labor unions, and workmen like Miles\n      Bjornstam, who are punished by being mocked as \"cranks,\" as \"half-baked\n      parlor socialists.\" The editor and the rector preach at them. The cloud of\n      serene ignorance submerges them in unhappiness and futility.",
                "V",
                "Here Vida observed, \"Yes -- well --  -- Do you know, I've always\n      thought that Ray would have made a wonderful rector. He has what I call an\n      essentially religious soul. My! He'd have read the service beautifully! I\n      suppose it's too late now, but as I tell him, he can also serve the world\n      by selling shoes and --  -- I wonder if we oughtn't to have\n      family-prayers?\"",
                "VI",
                "Doubtless all small towns, in all countries, in all ages, Carol admitted,\n      have a tendency to be not only dull but mean, bitter, infested with\n      curiosity. In France or Tibet quite as much as in Wyoming or Indiana these\n      timidities are inherent in isolation.",
                "But a village in a country which is taking pains to become altogether\n      standardized and pure, which aspires to succeed Victorian England as the\n      chief mediocrity of the world, is no longer merely provincial, no longer\n      downy and restful in its leaf-shadowed ignorance. It is a force seeking to\n      dominate the earth, to drain the hills and sea of color, to set Dante at\n      boosting Gopher Prairie, and to dress the high gods in Klassy Kollege\n      Klothes. Sure of itself, it bullies other civilizations, as a traveling\n      salesman in a brown derby conquers the wisdom of China and tacks\n      advertisements of cigarettes over arches for centuries dedicate to the\n      sayings of Confucius.",
                "Such a society functions admirably in the large production of cheap\n      automobiles, dollar watches, and safety razors. But it is not satisfied\n      until the entire world also admits that the end and joyous purpose of\n      living is to ride in flivvers, to make advertising-pictures of dollar\n      watches, and in the twilight to sit talking not of love and courage but of\n      the convenience of safety razors.",
                "And such a society, such a nation, is determined by the Gopher Prairies.\n      The greatest manufacturer is but a busier Sam Clark, and all the rotund\n      senators and presidents are village lawyers and bankers grown nine feet\n      tall.",
                "Though a Gopher Prairie regards itself as a part of the Great World,\n      compares itself to Rome and Vienna, it will not acquire the scientific\n      spirit, the international mind, which would make it great. It picks at\n      information which will visibly procure money or social distinction. Its\n      conception of a community ideal is not the grand manner, the noble\n      aspiration, the fine aristocratic pride, but cheap labor for the kitchen\n      and rapid increase in the price of land. It plays at cards on greasy\n      oil-cloth in a shanty, and does not know that prophets are walking and\n      talking on the terrace.",
                "If all the provincials were as kindly as Champ Perry and Sam Clark there\n      would be no reason for desiring the town to seek great traditions. It is\n      the Harry Haydocks, the Dave Dyers, the Jackson Elders, small busy men\n      crushingly powerful in their common purpose, viewing themselves as men of\n      the world but keeping themselves men of the cash-register and the comic\n      film, who make the town a sterile oligarchy.",

                "She had sought to be definite in analyzing the surface ugliness of the\n      Gopher Prairies. She asserted that it is a matter of universal similarity;\n      of flimsiness of construction, so that the towns resemble frontier camps;\n      of neglect of natural advantages, so that the hills are covered with\n      brush, the lakes shut off by railroads, and the creeks lined with\n      dumping-grounds; of depressing sobriety of color; rectangularity of\n      buildings; and excessive breadth and straightness of the gashed streets,\n      so that there is no escape from gales and from sight of the grim sweep of\n      land, nor any windings to coax the loiterer along, while the breadth which\n      would be majestic in an avenue of palaces makes the low shabby shops\n      creeping down the typical Main Street the more mean by comparison.",
                "The universal similarity -- that is the physical expression of the\n      philosophy of dull safety. Nine-tenths of the American towns are so alike\n      that it is the completest boredom to wander from one to another. Always,\n      west of Pittsburg, and often, east of it, there is the same lumber yard,\n      the same railroad station, the same Ford garage, the same creamery, the\n      same box-like houses and two-story shops. The new, more conscious houses\n      are alike in their very attempts at diversity: the same bungalows, the\n      same square houses of stucco or tapestry brick. The shops show the same\n      standardized, nationally advertised wares; the newspapers of sections\n      three thousand miles apart have the same \"syndicated features\"; the boy in\n      Arkansas displays just such a flamboyant ready-made suit as is found on\n      just such a boy in Delaware, both of them iterate the same slang phrases\n      from the same sporting-pages, and if one of them is in college and the\n      other is a barber, no one may surmise which is which.",
                "If Kennicott were snatched from Gopher Prairie and instantly conveyed to a\n      town leagues away, he would not realize it. He would go down apparently\n      the same Main Street (almost certainly it would be called Main Street); in\n      the same drug store he would see the same young man serving the same\n      ice-cream soda to the same young woman with the same magazines and\n      phonograph records under her arm. Not till he had climbed to his office\n      and found another sign on the door, another Dr. Kennicott inside, would he\n      understand that something curious had presumably happened.",
                "Finally, behind all her comments, Carol saw the fact that the prairie\n      towns no more exist to serve the farmers who are their reason of existence\n      than do the great capitals; they exist to fatten on the farmers, to\n      provide for the townsmen large motors and social preferment; and, unlike\n      the capitals, they do not give to the district in return for usury a\n      stately and permanent center, but only this ragged camp. It is a\n      \"parasitic Greek civilization\" -- minus the civilization.",
                "\"There we are then,\" said Carol. \"The remedy? Is there any? Criticism,\n      perhaps, for the beginning of the beginning. Oh, there's nothing that\n      attacks the Tribal God Mediocrity that doesn't help a little . . . and\n      probably there's nothing that helps very much. Perhaps some day the\n      farmers will build and own their market-towns. (Think of the club they\n      could have!) But I'm afraid I haven't any 'reform program.' Not any more!\n      The trouble is spiritual, and no League or Party can enact a preference\n      for gardens rather than dumping-grounds. . . . There's my confession.\n      WELL?\"",

                "\"Well, my dear, if I DID take all your notions seriously, it would be\n      pretty discouraging.

The civic improvements which I'd like\n      the Thanatopsis to advocate are Strindberg plays, and classic dancers -- exquisite\n      legs beneath tulle -- and (I can see him so clearly!) a thick,\n      black-bearded, cynical Frenchman who would sit about and drink and sing\n      opera and tell bawdy stories and laugh at our proprieties and quote\n      Rabelais and not be ashamed to kiss my hand!\"",

Sam Clark, on the\n      school-board, is working for better school ventilation. Ella Stowbody\n      (whose elocuting you always think is so absurd) has persuaded the railroad\n      to share the expense of a parked space at the station, to do away with\n      that vacant lot.",

When Vida asked her to take charge of a group of Camp Fire Girls,\n      she obeyed, and had definite pleasure out of the Indian dances and ritual\n      and costumes. She went more regularly to the Thanatopsis. With Vida as\n      lieutenant and unofficial commander she campaigned for a village nurse to\n      attend poor families, raised the fund herself, saw to it that the nurse\n      was young and strong and amiable and intelligent.",

Passengers looking from trains saw her as a village\n      woman of fading prettiness, incorruptible virtue, and no abnormalities;\n      the baggageman heard her say, \"Oh yes, I do think it will be a good\n      example for the children\"; and all the while she saw herself running\n      garlanded through the streets of Babylon.",

She knelt to embrace him; she\n      affirmed that he made life more than full; she was altogether reconciled .\n      . . for an hour.",

                "Bresnahan dropped his arm caressingly on Carol's shoulder; he pronounced,\n      \"My Lord, you're a lucky girl to have a fine young husk like that. I\n      figure Will knew what he was doing when he persuaded you to take a chance\n      on an old bum like him! They tell me you come from St. Paul. We're going\n      to get you to come to Boston some day.\" He leaned over the bed. \"Young\n      man, you're the slickest sight I've seen this side of Boston. With your\n      permission, may we present you with a slight token of our regard and\n      appreciation of your long service?\"",
                "He held out a red rubber Pierrot. Hugh remarked, \"Gimme it,\" hid it under\n      the bedclothes, and stared at Bresnahan as though he had never seen the\n      man before.",
                "For once Carol permitted herself the spiritual luxury of not asking \"Why,\n      Hugh dear, what do you say when some one gives you a present?\" The great\n      man was apparently waiting. They stood in inane suspense till Bresnahan\n      led them out, rumbling, \"How about planning a fishing-trip, Will?\"",
                "He remained for half an hour. Always he told Carol what a charming person\n      she was; always he looked at her knowingly.",
                "\"Yes. He probably would make a woman fall in love with him. But it\n      wouldn't last a week. I'd get tired of his confounded buoyancy. His\n      hypocrisy. He's a spiritual bully. He makes me rude to him in\n      self-defense. Oh yes, he is glad to be here. He does like us. He's so good\n      an actor that he convinces his own self. . . . I'd HATE him in Boston.\n      He'd have all the obvious big-city things. Limousines. Discreet\n      evening-clothes. Order a clever dinner at a smart restaurant. Drawing-room\n      decorated by the best firm -- but the pictures giving him away. I'd\n      rather talk to Guy Pollock in his dusty office. . . . How I lie! His arm\n      coaxed my shoulder and his eyes dared me not to admire him. I'd be afraid\n      of him. I hate him! . . . Oh, the inconceivable egotistic imagination of\n      women! All this stew of analysis about a man, a good, decent, friendly,\n      efficient man, because he was kind to me, as Will's wife!\"",

                "The Kennicotts, the Elders, the Clarks, and Bresnahan went fishing at Red\n      Squaw Lake. They drove forty miles to the lake in Elder's new Cadillac.\n      There was much laughter and bustle at the start, much storing of\n      lunch-baskets and jointed poles, much inquiry as to whether it would\n      really bother Carol to sit with her feet up on a roll of shawls. When they\n      were ready to go Mrs. Clark lamented, \"Oh, Sam, I forgot my magazine,\" and\n      Bresnahan bullied, \"Come on now, if you women think you're going to be\n      literary, you can't go with us tough guys!\" Every one laughed a great\n      deal, and as they drove on Mrs. Clark explained that though probably she\n      would not have read it, still, she might have wanted to, while the other\n      girls had a nap in the afternoon, and she was right in the middle of a\n      serial -- it was an awfully exciting story -- it seems that this\n      girl was a Turkish dancer (only she was really the daughter of an American\n      lady and a Russian prince) and men kept running after her, just\n      disgustingly, but she remained pure, and there was a scene --  --",
                "While the men floated on the lake, casting for black bass, the women\n      prepared lunch and yawned. Carol was a little resentful of the manner in\n      which the men assumed that they did not care to fish. \"I don't want to go\n      with them, but I would like the privilege of refusing.\"",
                "The lunch was long and pleasant. It was a background for the talk of the\n      great man come home, hints of cities and large imperative affairs and\n      famous people, jocosely modest admissions that, yes, their friend Perce\n      was doing about as well as most of these \"Boston swells that think so much\n      of themselves because they come from rich old families and went to college\n      and everything. Believe me, it's us new business men that are running\n      Beantown today, and not a lot of fussy old bucks snoozing in their clubs!\"",
                "Carol realized that he was not one of the sons of Gopher Prairie who, if\n      they do not actually starve in the East, are invariably spoken of as\n      \"highly successful\"; and she found behind his too incessant flattery a\n      genuine affection for his mates. It was in the matter of the war that he\n      most favored and thrilled them. Dropping his voice while they bent nearer\n      (there was no one within two miles to overhear), he disclosed the fact\n      that in both Boston and Washington he'd been getting a lot of inside stuff\n      on the war -- right straight from headquarters -- he was in touch\n      with some men -- couldn't name them but they were darn high up in both\n      the War and State Departments -- and he would say -- only for Pete's\n      sake they mustn't breathe one word of this; it was strictly on the Q.T.\n      and not generally known outside of Washington -- but just between\n      ourselves -- and they could take this for gospel -- Spain had\n      finally decided to join the Entente allies in the Grand Scrap. Yes, sir,\n      there'd be two million fully equipped Spanish soldiers fighting with us in\n      France in one month now. Some surprise for Germany, all right!",
                "\"How about the prospects for revolution in Germany?\" reverently asked\n      Kennicott.",
                "The authority grunted, \"Nothing to it. The one thing you can bet on is\n      that no matter what happens to the German people, win or lose, they'll\n      stick by the Kaiser till hell freezes over. I got that absolutely\n      straight, from a fellow who's on the inside of the inside in Washington.\n      No, sir! I don't pretend to know much about international affairs but one\n      thing you can put down as settled is that Germany will be a Hohenzollern\n      empire for the next forty years. At that, I don't know as it's so bad. The\n      Kaiser and the Junkers keep a firm hand on a lot of these red agitators\n      who'd be worse than a king if they could get control.\"",
                "\"I'm terribly interested in this uprising that overthrew the Czar in\n      Russia,\" suggested Carol. She had finally been conquered by the man's\n      wizard knowledge of affairs.",
                "Kennicott apologized for her: \"Carrie's nuts about this Russian\n      revolution. Is there much to it, Perce?\"",
                "\"There is not!\" Bresnahan said flatly. \"I can speak by the book there.\n      Carol, honey, I'm surprised to find you talking like a New York Russian\n      Jew, or one of these long-hairs! I can tell you, only you don't need to\n      let every one in on it, this is confidential, I got it from a man who's\n      close to the State Department, but as a matter of fact the Czar will be\n      back in power before the end of the year. You read a lot about his\n      retiring and about his being killed, but I know he's got a big army back\n      of him, and he'll show these damn agitators, lazy beggars hunting for a\n      soft berth bossing the poor goats that fall for 'em, he'll show 'em where\n      they get off!\"",
                "Carol was sorry to hear that the Czar was coming back, but she said\n      nothing. The others had looked vacant at the mention of a country so far\n      away as Russia. Now they edged in and asked Bresnahan what he thought\n      about the Packard car, investments in Texas oil-wells, the comparative\n      merits of young men born in Minnesota and in Massachusetts, the question\n      of prohibition, the future cost of motor tires, and wasn't it true that\n      American aviators put it all over these Frenchmen?",
                "They were glad to find that he agreed with them on every point.",
                "As she heard Bresnahan announce, \"We're perfectly willing to talk to any\n      committee the men may choose, but we're not going to stand for some\n      outside agitator butting in and telling us how we're going to run our\n      plant!\" Carol remembered that Jackson Elder (now meekly receiving New\n      Ideas) had said the same thing in the same words.",
                "While Sam Clark was digging up from his memory a long and immensely\n      detailed story of the crushing things he had said to a Pullman porter,\n      named George, Bresnahan hugged his knees and rocked and watched Carol. She\n      wondered if he did not understand the laboriousness of the smile with\n      which she listened to Kennicott's account of the \"good one he had on\n      Carrie,\" that marital, coyly improper, ten-times-told tale of how she had\n      forgotten to attend to Hugh because she was \"all het up pounding the box\" -- which\n      may be translated as \"eagerly playing the piano.\" She was certain that\n      Bresnahan saw through her when she pretended not to hear Kennicott's\n      invitation to join a game of cribbage. She feared the comments he might\n      make; she was irritated by her fear.",
                "She was equally irritated, when the motor returned through Gopher Prairie,\n      to find that she was proud of sharing in Bresnahan's kudos as people\n      waved, and Juanita Haydock leaned from a window. She said to herself, \"As\n      though I cared whether I'm seen with this fat phonograph!\" and\n      simultaneously, \"Everybody has noticed how much Will and I are playing\n      with Mr. Bresnahan.\"",
                "The town was full of his stories, his friendliness, his memory for names,\n      his clothes, his trout-flies, his generosity. He had given a hundred\n      dollars to Father Klubok the priest, and a hundred to the Reverend Mr.\n      Zitterel the Baptist minister, for Americanization work.",
                "At the Bon Ton, Carol heard Nat Hicks the tailor exulting:",

Well, the Red Swede got the grand razz handed to him, all\n      right. He had the nerve to breeze up to Perce, at Dave Dyer's, and he\n      said, he said to Perce, 'I've always wanted to look at a man that was so\n      useful that folks would pay him a million dollars for existing,' and Perce\n      gave him the once-over and come right back, 'Have, eh?' he says. 'Well,'\n      he says, 'I've been looking for a man so useful sweeping floors that I\n      could pay him four dollars a day. Want the job, my friend?' Ha, ha, ha!\n      Say, you know how lippy Bjornstam is? Well for once he didn't have a thing\n      to say.

                "\"Bring him along! Bring him along!\" Bresnahan was out of the seat,\n      stalking up the sidewalk, and the rest of her protests and dignities were\n      feeble.",

Then there's another kind of house that's mighty nice and\n      substantial-looking, with shingles, in a nice brown stain, instead of\n      clapboards -- seen some in Minneapolis.

It was\n      probable, now that Kennicott was past forty, and settled, that this would\n      be the last venture he would ever make in building. So long as she stayed\n      in this ark, she would always have a possibility of change, but once she\n      was in the new house, there she would sit for all the rest of her life -- there\n      she would die. Desperately she wanted to put it off, against the chance of\n      miracles. While Kennicott was chattering about a patent swing-door for the\n      garage she saw the swing-doors of a prison.",

It was the first unusual thing,\n      except the glance of Bresnahan, that had happened since the weaning of\n      Hugh. They rode in the caboose, the small red cupola-topped car jerked\n      along at the end of the train.

Kennicott played seven-up with the\n      conductor and two brakemen. Carol liked the blue silk kerchiefs about the\n      brakemen's throats; she liked their welcome to her, and their air of\n      friendly independence. Since there were no sweating passengers crammed in\n      beside her, she reveled in the train's slowness. She was part of these\n      lakes and tawny wheat-fields.

The men were\n      oblivious of their wives as they gave the social passwords of Main Street,\n      the orthodox opinions on weather, crops, and motor cars, then flung away\n      restraint and gyrated in the debauch of shop-talk. Stroking his chin,\n      drawling in the ecstasy of being erudite, Kennicott inquired, \"Say,\n      doctor, what success have you had with thyroid for treatment of pains in\n      the legs before child-birth?\"",

In the lee of the stonily mature trio\n      Carol proceeded to the street fair which added mundane gaiety to the\n      annual rites of the United and Fraternal Order of Beavers. Beavers, human\n      Beavers, were everywhere: thirty-second degree Beavers in gray sack suits\n      and decent derbies, more flippant Beavers in crash summer coats and straw\n      hats, rustic Beavers in shirt sleeves and frayed suspenders; but whatever\n      his caste-symbols, every Beaver was distinguished by an enormous\n      shrimp-colored ribbon lettered in silver, \"Sir Knight and Brother, U.

The dignified delegates were shy of the booths, but country\n      boys with brickred necks and pale-blue ties and bright-yellow shoes, who\n      had brought sweethearts into town in somewhat dusty and listed Fords, were\n      wolfing sandwiches, drinking strawberry pop out of bottles, and riding the\n      revolving crimson and gold horses. They shrieked and giggled;\n      peanut-roasters whistled; the merry-go-round pounded out monotonous music;\n      the barkers bawled, \"Here's your chance -- here's your chance -- come\n      on here, boy -- come on here -- give that girl a good time -- give\n      her a swell time -- here's your chance to win a genuwine gold watch for\n      five cents, half a dime, the twentieth part of a dollah!\" The prairie sun\n      jabbed the unshaded street with shafts that were like poisonous thorns the\n      tinny cornices above the brick stores were glaring; the dull breeze\n      scattered dust on sweaty Beavers who crawled along in tight scorching new\n      shoes, up two blocks and back, up two blocks and back, wondering what to\n      do next, working at having a good time.",

He protested, \"What do\n      you want to talk to that crank for?\" He hinted that a former \"Swede hired\n      girl\" was low company for the son of Dr. Will Kennicott. She did not\n      explain. She did not quite understand it herself; did not know that in the\n      Bjornstams she found her friends, her club, her sympathy and her ration of\n      blessed cynicism. For a time the gossip of Juanita Haydock and the Jolly\n      Seventeen had been a refuge from the droning of Aunt Bessie, but the\n      relief had not continued. The young matrons made her nervous. They talked\n      so loud, always so loud. They filled a room with clashing cackle; their\n      jests and gags they repeated nine times over. Unconsciously, she had\n      discarded the Jolly Seventeen, Guy Pollock, Vida, and every one save Mrs.\n      Dr. Westlake and the friends whom she did not clearly know as friends -- the\n      Bjornstams.",
                "To Hugh, the Red Swede was the most heroic and powerful person in the\n      world. With unrestrained adoration he trotted after while Miles fed the\n      cows, chased his one pig -- an animal of lax and migratory instincts -- or\n      dramatically slaughtered a chicken. And to Hugh, Olaf was lord among\n      mortal men, less stalwart than the old monarch, King Miles, but more\n      understanding of the relations and values of things, of small sticks, lone\n      playing-cards, and irretrievably injured hoops.",
                "Carol saw, though she did not admit, that Olaf was not only more beautiful\n      than her own dark child, but more gracious. Olaf was a Norse chieftain:\n      straight, sunny-haired, large-limbed, resplendently amiable to his\n      subjects. Hugh was a vulgarian; a bustling business man. It was Hugh that\n      bounced and said \"Let's play\"; Olaf that opened luminous blue eyes and\n      agreed \"All right,\" in condescending gentleness. If Hugh batted him -- and\n      Hugh did bat him -- Olaf was unafraid but shocked. In magnificent\n      solitude he marched toward the house, while Hugh bewailed his sin and the\n      overclouding of august favor.",
                "The two friends played with an imperial chariot which Miles had made out\n      of a starch-box and four red spools; together they stuck switches into a\n      mouse-hole, with vast satisfaction though entirely without known results.",
                "Bea, the chubby and humming Bea, impartially gave cookies and scoldings to\n      both children, and if Carol refused a cup of coffee and a wafer of\n      buttered knackebrod, she was desolated.",
                "Miles had done well with his dairy. He had six cows, two hundred chickens,\n      a cream separator, a Ford truck. In the spring he had built a two-room\n      addition to his shack. That illustrious building was to Hugh a carnival.\n      Uncle Miles did the most spectacular, unexpected things: ran up the\n      ladder; stood on the ridge-pole, waving a hammer and singing something\n      about \"To arms, my citizens\"; nailed shingles faster than Aunt Bessie\n      could iron handkerchiefs; and lifted a two-by-six with Hugh riding on one\n      end and Olaf on the other. Uncle Miles's most ecstatic trick was to make\n      figures not on paper but right on a new pine board, with the broadest\n      softest pencil in the world. There was a thing worth seeing!",
                "The tools! In his office Father had tools fascinating in their shininess\n      and curious shapes, but they were sharp, they were something called\n      sterized, and they distinctly were not for boys to touch. In fact it was a\n      good dodge to volunteer \"I must not touch,\" when you looked at the tools\n      on the glass shelves in Father's office. But Uncle Miles, who was a person\n      altogether superior to Father, let you handle all his kit except the saws.\n      There was a hammer with a silver head; there was a metal thing like a big\n      L; there was a magic instrument, very precious, made out of costly red\n      wood and gold, with a tube which contained a drop -- no, it wasn't a\n      drop, it was a nothing, which lived in the water, but the nothing LOOKED\n      like a drop, and it ran in a frightened way up and down the tube, no\n      matter how cautiously you tilted the magic instrument. And there were\n      nails, very different and clever -- big valiant spikes, middle-sized\n      ones which were not very interesting, and shingle-nails much jollier than\n      the fussed-up fairies in the yellow book.",
                "II",
                "While he had worked on the addition Miles had talked frankly to Carol. He\n      admitted now that so long as he stayed in Gopher Prairie he would remain a\n      pariah. Bea's Lutheran friends were as much offended by his agnostic gibes\n      as the merchants by his radicalism. \"And I can't seem to keep my mouth\n      shut. I think I'm being a baa-lamb, and not springing any theories wilder\n      than 'c-a-t spells cat,' but when folks have gone, I re'lize I've been\n      stepping on their pet religious corns. Oh, the mill foreman keeps dropping\n      in, and that Danish shoemaker, and one fellow from Elder's factory, and a\n      few Svenskas, but you know Bea: big good-hearted wench like her wants a\n      lot of folks around -- likes to fuss over 'em -- never satisfied\n      unless she tiring herself out making coffee for somebody.",
                "\"Once she kidnapped me and drug me to the Methodist Church. I goes in,\n      pious as Widow Bogart, and sits still and never cracks a smile while the\n      preacher is favoring us with his misinformation on evolution. But\n      afterwards, when the old stalwarts were pumphandling everybody at the door\n      and calling 'em 'Brother' and 'Sister,' they let me sail right by with\n      nary a clinch. They figure I'm the town badman. Always will be, I guess.\n      It'll have to be Olaf who goes on. 'And sometimes --  -- Blamed if I\n      don't feel like coming out and saying, 'I've been conservative. Nothing to\n      it. Now I'm going to start something in these rotten one-horse\n      lumber-camps west of town.' But Bea's got me hypnotized. Lord, Mrs.\n      Kennicott, do you re'lize what a jolly, square, faithful woman she is? And\n      I love Olaf --  -- Oh well, I won't go and get sentimental on you.",
                "\"Course I've had thoughts of pulling up stakes and going West. Maybe if\n      they didn't know it beforehand, they wouldn't find out I'd ever been\n      guilty of trying to think for myself. But -- oh, I've worked hard, and\n      built up this dairy business, and I hate to start all over again, and move\n      Bea and the kid into another one-room shack. That's how they get us!\n      Encourage us to be thrifty and own our own houses, and then, by golly,\n      they've got us; they know we won't dare risk everything by committing lez -- what\n      is it? lez majesty? -- I mean they know we won't be hinting around that\n      if we had a co-operative bank, we could get along without Stowbody. Well --  -- As\n      long as I can sit and play pinochle with Bea, and tell whoppers to Olaf\n      about his daddy's adventures in the woods, and how he snared a wapaloosie\n      and knew Paul Bunyan, why, I don't mind being a bum. It's just for them\n      that I mind. Say! Say! Don't whisper a word to Bea, but when I get this\n      addition done, I'm going to buy her a phonograph!\"",

The addition gave her a\n      kitchen with a bedroom above. The original one-room shack was now a\n      living-room, with the phonograph, a genuine leather-upholstered golden-oak\n      rocker, and a picture of Governor John Johnson.",

                "\"Their stomachs are out of whack. I wanted to call in Doc Kennicott, but\n      Bea thinks the doc doesn't like us -- she thinks maybe he's sore\n      because you come down here. But I'm getting worried.\"",
                "\"I'm going to call the doctor at once.\"",
                "She yearned over Olaf. His lambent eyes were stupid, he moaned, he rubbed\n      his forehead.",
                "\"Have they been eating something that's been bad for them?\" she fluttered\n      to Miles.",
                "\"Might be bum water. I'll tell you: We used to get our water at Oscar\n      Eklund's place, over across the street, but Oscar kept dinging at me, and\n      hinting I was a tightwad not to dig a well of my own. One time he said,\n      'Sure, you socialists are great on divvying up other folks' money -- and\n      water!' I knew if he kept it up there'd be a fuss, and I ain't safe to\n      have around, once a fuss starts; I'm likely to forget myself and let loose\n      with a punch in the snoot. I offered to pay Oscar but he refused -- he'd\n      rather have the chance to kid me.

                "One scarlet word was before Carol's eyes while she listened. She fled to\n      Kennicott's office. He gravely heard her out; nodded, said, \"Be right\n      over.\"",
                "He examined Bea and Olaf. He shook his head. \"Yes. Looks to me like\n      typhoid.\"",
                "\"Golly, I've seen typhoid in lumber-camps,\" groaned Miles, all the\n      strength dripping out of him. \"Have they got it very bad?\"",
                "\"Oh, we'll take good care of them,\" said Kennicott, and for the first time\n      in their acquaintance he smiled on Miles and clapped his shoulder.",
                "\"Won't you need a nurse?\" demanded Carol.",
                "\"Why --  -- \" To Miles, Kennicott hinted, \"Couldn't you get Bea's\n      cousin, Tina?\"",
                "\"She's down at the old folks', in the country.\"",
                "\"Then let me do it!\" Carol insisted. \"They need some one to cook for them,\n      and isn't it good to give them sponge baths, in typhoid?\"",
                "\"Yes. All right.\" Kennicott was automatic; he was the official, the\n      physician. \"I guess probably it would be hard to get a nurse here in town\n      just now. Mrs. Stiver is busy with an obstetrical case, and that town\n      nurse of yours is off on vacation, ain't she? All right, Bjornstam can\n      spell you at night.\"",
                "All week, from eight each morning till midnight, Carol fed them, bathed\n      them, smoothed sheets, took temperatures. Miles refused to let her cook.\n      Terrified, pallid, noiseless in stocking feet, he did the kitchen work and\n      the sweeping, his big red hands awkwardly careful. Kennicott came in three\n      times a day, unchangingly tender and hopeful in the sick-room, evenly\n      polite to Miles.",
                "Carol understood how great was her love for her friends. It bore her\n      through; it made her arm steady and tireless to bathe them. What exhausted\n      her was the sight of Bea and Olaf turned into flaccid invalids,\n      uncomfortably flushed after taking food, begging for the healing of sleep\n      at night.",
                "During the second week Olaf's powerful legs were flabby. Spots of a\n      viciously delicate pink came out on his chest and back. His cheeks sank.\n      He looked frightened. His tongue was brown and revolting. His confident\n      voice dwindled to a bewildered murmur, ceaseless and racking.",
                "Bea had stayed on her feet too long at the beginning. The moment Kennicott\n      had ordered her to bed she had begun to collapse. One early evening she\n      startled them by screaming, in an intense abdominal pain, and within half\n      an hour she was in a delirium. Till dawn Carol was with her, and not all\n      of Bea's groping through the blackness of half-delirious pain was so\n      pitiful to Carol as the way in which Miles silently peered into the room\n      from the top of the narrow stairs. Carol slept three hours next morning,\n      and ran back. Bea was altogether delirious but she muttered nothing save,\n      \"Olaf -- ve have such a good time --  -- \"",
                "At ten, while Carol was preparing an ice-bag in the kitchen, Miles\n      answered a knock. At the front door she saw Vida Sherwin, Maud Dyer, and\n      Mrs. Zitterel, wife of the Baptist pastor. They were carrying grapes, and\n      women's-magazines, magazines with high-colored pictures and optimistic\n      fiction.",
                "\"We just heard your wife was sick. We've come to see if there isn't\n      something we can do,\" chirruped Vida.",
                "Miles looked steadily at the three women. \"You're too late. You can't do\n      nothing now. Bea's always kind of hoped that you folks would come see her.\n      She wanted to have a chance and be friends. She used to sit waiting for\n      somebody to knock. I've seen her sitting here, waiting. Now --  -- Oh,\n      you ain't worth God-damning.\" He shut the door.",
                "All day Carol watched Olaf's strength oozing. He was emaciated. His ribs\n      were grim clear lines, his skin was clammy, his pulse was feeble but\n      terrifyingly rapid. It beat -- beat -- beat in a drum-roll of death.\n      Late that afternoon he sobbed, and died.",
                "Bea did not know it. She was delirious. Next morning, when she went, she\n      did not know that Olaf would no longer swing his lath sword on the\n      door-step, no longer rule his subjects of the cattle-yard; that Miles's\n      son would not go East to college.",
                "Miles, Carol, Kennicott were silent. They washed the bodies together,\n      their eyes veiled.",
                "\"Go home now and sleep. You're pretty tired. I can't ever pay you back for\n      what you done,\" Miles whispered to Carol.",
                "\"Yes. But I'll be back here tomorrow. Go with you to the funeral,\" she\n      said laboriously.",
                "When the time for the funeral came, Carol was in bed, collapsed. She\n      assumed that neighbors would go. They had not told her that word of\n      Miles's rebuff to Vida had spread through town, a cyclonic fury.",
                "It was only by chance that, leaning on her elbow in bed, she glanced\n      through the window and saw the funeral of Bea and Olaf. There was no\n      music, no carriages. There was only Miles Bjornstam, in his black\n      wedding-suit, walking quite alone, head down, behind the shabby hearse\n      that bore the bodies of his wife and baby.",
                "An hour after, Hugh came into her room crying, and when she said as\n      cheerily as she could, \"What is it, dear?\" he besought, \"Mummy, I want to\n      go play with Olaf.\"",
                "That afternoon Juanita Haydock dropped in to brighten Carol. She said,\n      \"Too bad about this Bea that was your hired girl. But I don't waste any\n      sympathy on that man of hers. Everybody says he drank too much, and\n      treated his family awful, and that's how they got sick.\""

                "IT WAS at a supper of the Jolly Seventeen in August that Carol heard of\n      \"Elizabeth,\" from Mrs. Dave Dyer.",
                "Carol was fond of Maud Dyer, because she had been particularly agreeable\n      lately; had obviously repented of the nervous distaste which she had once\n      shown. Maud patted her hand when they met, and asked about Hugh.",
                "Kennicott said that he was \"kind of sorry for the girl, some ways; she's\n      too darn emotional, but still, Dave is sort of mean to her.\" He was polite\n      to poor Maud when they all went down to the cottages for a swim. Carol was\n      proud of that sympathy in him, and now she took pains to sit with their\n      new friend.",
                "Mrs. Dyer was bubbling, \"Oh, have you folks heard about this young fellow\n      that's just come to town that the boys call 'Elizabeth'? He's working in\n      Nat Hicks's tailor shop. I bet he doesn't make eighteen a week, but my!\n      isn't he the perfect lady though! He talks so refined, and oh, the lugs he\n      puts on -- belted coat, and pique collar with a gold pin, and socks to\n      match his necktie, and honest -- you won't believe this, but I got it\n      straight -- this fellow, you know he's staying at Mrs. Gurrey's punk\n      old boarding-house, and they say he asked Mrs. Gurrey if he ought to put\n      on a dress-suit for supper! Imagine! Can you beat that? And him nothing\n      but a Swede tailor -- Erik Valborg his name is. But he used to be in a\n      tailor shop in Minneapolis (they do say he's a smart needle-pusher, at\n      that) and he tries to let on that he's a regular city fellow. They say he\n      tries to make people think he's a poet -- carries books around and\n      pretends to read 'em. Myrtle Cass says she met him at a dance, and he was\n      mooning around all over the place, and he asked her did she like flowers\n      and poetry and music and everything; he spieled like he was a regular\n      United States Senator; and Myrtle -- she's a devil, that girl, ha! ha! -- she\n      kidded him along, and got him going, and honest, what d'you think he said?\n      He said he didn't find any intellectual companionship in this town. Can\n      you BEAT it? Imagine! And him a Swede tailor! My! And they say he's the\n      most awful mollycoddle -- looks just like a girl. The boys call him\n      'Elizabeth,' and they stop him and ask about the books he lets on to have\n      read, and he goes and tells them, and they take it all in and jolly him\n      terribly, and he never gets onto the fact they're kidding him. Oh, I think\n      it's just TOO funny!\"",
                "The Jolly Seventeen laughed, and Carol laughed with them. Mrs. Jack Elder\n      added that this Erik Valborg had confided to Mrs. Gurrey that he would\n      \"love to design clothes for women.\" Imagine! Mrs. Harvey Dillon had had a\n      glimpse of him, but honestly, she'd thought he was awfully handsome. This\n      was instantly controverted by Mrs. B. J. Gougerling, wife of the banker.\n      Mrs. Gougerling had had, she reported, a good look at this Valborg fellow.\n      She and B. J. had been motoring, and passed \"Elizabeth\" out by McGruder's\n      Bridge. He was wearing the awfullest clothes, with the waist pinched in\n      like a girl's. He was sitting on a rock doing nothing, but when he heard\n      the Gougerling car coming he snatched a book out of his pocket, and as\n      they went by he pretended to be reading it, to show off. And he wasn't\n      really good-looking -- just kind of soft, as B. J. had pointed out.",
                "When the husbands came they joined in the expose. \"My name is Elizabeth.\n      I'm the celebrated musical tailor. The skirts fall for me by the thou. Do\n      I get some more veal loaf?\" merrily shrieked Dave Dyer. He had some\n      admirable stories about the tricks the town youngsters had played on\n      Valborg. They had dropped a decaying perch into his pocket. They had\n      pinned on his back a sign, \"I'm the prize boob, kick me.\"",
                "Glad of any laughter, Carol joined the frolic, and surprised them by\n      crying, \"Dave, I do think you're the dearest thing since you got your hair\n      cut!\" That was an excellent sally. Everybody applauded. Kennicott looked\n      proud.",
                "She decided that sometime she really must go out of her way to pass\n      Hicks's shop and see this freak.",
                "II",
                "She was at Sunday morning service at the Baptist Church, in a solemn row\n      with her husband, Hugh, Uncle Whittier, Aunt Bessie.",
                "Despite Aunt Bessie's nagging the Kennicotts rarely attended church. The\n      doctor asserted, \"Sure, religion is a fine influence -- got to have it\n      to keep the lower classes in order -- fact, it's the only thing that\n      appeals to a lot of those fellows and makes 'em respect the rights of\n      property. And I guess this theology is O.K.; lot of wise old coots figured\n      it all out, and they knew more about it than we do.\" He believed in the\n      Christian religion, and never thought about it, he believed in the church,\n      and seldom went near it; he was shocked by Carol's lack of faith, and\n      wasn't quite sure what was the nature of the faith that she lacked.",
                "Carol herself was an uneasy and dodging agnostic.",
                "When she ventured to Sunday School and heard the teachers droning that the\n      genealogy of Shamsherai was a valuable ethical problem for children to\n      think about; when she experimented with Wednesday prayer-meeting and\n      listened to store-keeping elders giving their unvarying weekly testimony\n      in primitive erotic symbols and such gory Chaldean phrases as \"washed in\n      the blood of the lamb\" and \"a vengeful God\"; when Mrs. Bogart boasted that\n      through his boyhood she had made Cy confess nightly upon the basis of the\n      Ten Commandments; then Carol was dismayed to find the Christian religion,\n      in America, in the twentieth century, as abnormal as Zoroastrianism -- without\n      the splendor. But when she went to church suppers and felt the\n      friendliness, saw the gaiety with which the sisters served cold ham and\n      scalloped potatoes; when Mrs. Champ Perry cried to her, on an afternoon\n      call, \"My dear, if you just knew how happy it makes you to come into\n      abiding grace,\" then Carol found the humanness behind the sanguinary and\n      alien theology. Always she perceived that the churches -- Methodist,\n      Baptist, Congregational, Catholic, all of them -- which had seemed so\n      unimportant to the judge's home in her childhood, so isolated from the\n      city struggle in St. Paul, were still, in Gopher Prairie, the strongest of\n      the forces compelling respectability.",
                "This August Sunday she had been tempted by the announcement that the\n      Reverend Edmund Zitterel would preach on the topic \"America, Face Your\n      Problems!\" With the great war, workmen in every nation showing a desire to\n      control industries, Russia hinting a leftward revolution against Kerensky,\n      woman suffrage coming, there seemed to be plenty of problems for the\n      Reverend Mr. Zitterel to call on America to face. Carol gathered her\n      family and trotted off behind Uncle Whittier.",
                "The congregation faced the heat with informality. Men with highly\n      plastered hair, so painfully shaved that their faces looked sore, removed\n      their coats, sighed, and unbuttoned two buttons of their uncreased Sunday\n      vests. Large-bosomed, white-bloused, hot-necked, spectacled matrons -- the\n      Mothers in Israel, pioneers and friends of Mrs. Champ Perry -- waved\n      their palm-leaf fans in a steady rhythm. Abashed boys slunk into the rear\n      pews and giggled, while milky little girls, up front with their mothers,\n      self-consciously kept from turning around.",
                "The church was half barn and half Gopher Prairie parlor. The streaky brown\n      wallpaper was broken in its dismal sweep only by framed texts, \"Come unto\n      Me\" and \"The Lord is My Shepherd,\" by a list of hymns, and by a crimson\n      and green diagram, staggeringly drawn upon hemp-colored paper, indicating\n      the alarming ease with which a young man may descend from Palaces of\n      Pleasure and the House of Pride to Eternal Damnation. But the varnished\n      oak pews and the new red carpet and the three large chairs on the\n      platform, behind the bare reading-stand, were all of a rocking-chair\n      comfort.",
                "Carol was civic and neighborly and commendable today. She beamed and\n      bowed. She trolled out with the others the hymn:",
                "How pleasant 'tis on Sabbath morn\n     To gather in the church\n     And there I'll have no carnal thoughts,\n     Nor sin shall me besmirch.",
                "With a rustle of starched linen skirts and stiff shirt-fronts, the\n      congregation sat down, and gave heed to the Reverend Mr. Zitterel. The\n      priest was a thin, swart, intense young man with a bang. He wore a black\n      sack suit and a lilac tie. He smote the enormous Bible on the\n      reading-stand, vociferated, \"Come, let us reason together,\" delivered a\n      prayer informing Almighty God of the news of the past week, and began to\n      reason.",
                "It proved that the only problems which America had to face were Mormonism\n      and Prohibition:",
                "\"Don't let any of these self-conceited fellows that are always trying to\n      stir up trouble deceive you with the belief that there's anything to all\n      these smart-aleck movements to let the unions and the Farmers' Nonpartisan\n      League kill all our initiative and enterprise by fixing wages and prices.\n      There isn't any movement that amounts to a whoop without it's got a moral\n      background. And let me tell you that while folks are fussing about what\n      they call 'economics' and 'socialism' and 'science' and a lot of things\n      that are nothing in the world but a disguise for atheism, the Old Satan is\n      busy spreading his secret net and tentacles out there in Utah, under his\n      guise of Joe Smith or Brigham Young or whoever their leaders happen to be\n      today, it doesn't make any difference, and they're making game of the Old\n      Bible that has led this American people through its manifold trials and\n      tribulations to its firm position as the fulfilment of the prophecies and\n      the recognized leader of all nations. 'Sit thou on my right hand till I\n      make thine enemies the footstool of my feet,' said the Lord of Hosts, Acts\n      II, the thirty-fourth verse -- and let me tell you right now, you got\n      to get up a good deal earlier in the morning than you get up even when\n      you're going fishing, if you want to be smarter than the Lord, who has\n      shown us the straight and narrow way, and he that passeth therefrom is in\n      eternal peril and, to return to this vital and terrible subject of\n      Mormonism -- and as I say, it is terrible to realize how little\n      attention is given to this evil right here in our midst and on our very\n      doorstep, as it were -- it's a shame and a disgrace that the Congress\n      of these United States spends all its time talking about inconsequential\n      financial matters that ought to be left to the Treasury Department, as I\n      understand it, instead of arising in their might and passing a law that\n      any one admitting he is a Mormon shall simply be deported and as it were\n      kicked out of this free country in which we haven't got any room for\n      polygamy and the tyrannies of Satan.",
                "\"And, to digress for a moment, especially as there are more of them in\n      this state than there are Mormons, though you never can tell what will\n      happen with this vain generation of young girls, that think more about\n      wearing silk stockings than about minding their mothers and learning to\n      bake a good loaf of bread, and many of them listening to these sneaking\n      Mormon missionaries -- and I actually heard one of them talking right\n      out on a street-corner in Duluth, a few years ago, and the officers of the\n      law not protesting -- but still, as they are a smaller but more\n      immediate problem, let me stop for just a moment to pay my respects to\n      these Seventh-Day Adventists. Not that they are immoral, I don't mean, but\n      when a body of men go on insisting that Saturday is the Sabbath, after\n      Christ himself has clearly indicated the new dispensation, then I think\n      the legislature ought to step in --  -- \"",
                "At this point Carol awoke.",
                "She got through three more minutes by studying the face of a girl in the\n      pew across: a sensitive unhappy girl whose longing poured out with\n      intimidating self-revelation as she worshiped Mr. Zitterel. Carol wondered\n      who the girl was. She had seen her at church suppers. She considered how\n      many of the three thousand people in the town she did not know; to how\n      many of them the Thanatopsis and the Jolly Seventeen were icy social\n      peaks; how many of them might be toiling through boredom thicker than her\n      own -- with greater courage.",
                "She examined her nails. She read two hymns. She got some satisfaction out\n      of rubbing an itching knuckle. She pillowed on her shoulder the head of\n      the baby who, after killing time in the same manner as his mother, was so\n      fortunate as to fall asleep. She read the introduction, title-page, and\n      acknowledgment of copyrights, in the hymnal. She tried to evolve a\n      philosophy which would explain why Kennicott could never tie his scarf so\n      that it would reach the top of the gap in his turn-down collar.",
                "There were no other diversions to be found in the pew. She glanced back at\n      the congregation. She thought that it would be amiable to bow to Mrs.\n      Champ Perry.",
                "Her slow turning head stopped, galvanized.",
                "Across the aisle, two rows back, was a strange young man who shone among\n      the cud-chewing citizens like a visitant from the sun-amber curls, low\n      forehead, fine nose, chin smooth but not raw from Sabbath shaving. His\n      lips startled her. The lips of men in Gopher Prairie are flat in the face,\n      straight and grudging. The stranger's mouth was arched, the upper lip\n      short. He wore a brown jersey coat, a delft-blue bow, a white silk shirt,\n      white flannel trousers. He suggested the ocean beach, a tennis court,\n      anything but the sun-blistered utility of Main Street.",
                "A visitor from Minneapolis, here for business? No. He wasn't a business\n      man. He was a poet. Keats was in his face, and Shelley, and Arthur Upson,\n      whom she had once seen in Minneapolis. He was at once too sensitive and\n      too sophisticated to touch business as she knew it in Gopher Prairie.",
                "With restrained amusement he was analyzing the noisy Mr. Zitterel. Carol\n      was ashamed to have this spy from the Great World hear the pastor's\n      maundering. She felt responsible for the town. She resented his gaping at\n      their private rites. She flushed, turned away. But she continued to feel\n      his presence.",
                "How could she meet him? She must! For an hour of talk. He was all that she\n      was hungry for. She could not let him get away without a word -- and\n      she would have to. She pictured, and ridiculed, herself as walking up to\n      him and remarking, \"I am sick with the Village Virus. Will you please tell\n      me what people are saying and playing in New York?\" She pictured, and\n      groaned over, the expression of Kennicott if she should say, \"Why wouldn't\n      it be reasonable for you, my soul, to ask that complete stranger in the\n      brown jersey coat to come to supper tonight?\"",
                "She brooded, not looking back. She warned herself that she was probably\n      exaggerating; that no young man could have all these exalted qualities.\n      Wasn't he too obviously smart, too glossy-new? Like a movie actor.\n      Probably he was a traveling salesman who sang tenor and fancied himself in\n      imitations of Newport clothes and spoke of \"the swellest business\n      proposition that ever came down the pike.\" In a panic she peered at him.\n      No! This was no hustling salesman, this boy with the curving Grecian lips\n      and the serious eyes.",
                "She rose after the service, carefully taking Kennicott's arm and smiling\n      at him in a mute assertion that she was devoted to him no matter what\n      happened. She followed the Mystery's soft brown jersey shoulders out of\n      the church.",
                "Fatty Hicks, the shrill and puffy son of Nat, flapped his hand at the\n      beautiful stranger and jeered, \"How's the kid? All dolled up like a plush\n      horse today, ain't we!\"",
                "Carol was exceeding sick. Her herald from the outside was Erik Valborg,\n      \"Elizabeth.\" Apprentice tailor! Gasoline and hot goose! Mending dirty\n      jackets! Respectfully holding a tape-measure about a paunch!",
                "And yet, she insisted, this boy was also himself.",
                "III",
                "They had Sunday dinner with the Smails, in a dining-room which centered\n      about a fruit and flower piece and a crayon-enlargement of Uncle Whittier.\n      Carol did not heed Aunt Bessie's fussing in regard to Mrs. Robert B.\n      Schminke's bead necklace and Whittier's error in putting on the striped\n      pants, day like this. She did not taste the shreds of roast pork. She said\n      vacuously:",
                "\"Uh -- Will, I wonder if that young man in the white flannel trousers,\n      at church this morning, was this Valborg person that they're all talking\n      about?\"",
                "\"Yump. That's him. Wasn't that the darndest get-up he had on!\" Kennicott\n      scratched at a white smear on his hard gray sleeve.",
                "\"It wasn't so bad. I wonder where he comes from? He seems to have lived in\n      cities a good deal. Is he from the East?\"",
                "\"The East? Him? Why, he comes from a farm right up north here, just this\n      side of Jefferson. I know his father slightly -- Adolph Valborg -- typical\n      cranky old Swede farmer.\"",
                "\"Oh, really?\" blandly.",
                "\"Believe he has lived in Minneapolis for quite some time, though. Learned\n      his trade there. And I will say he's bright, some ways. Reads a lot.\n      Pollock says he takes more books out of the library than anybody else in\n      town. Huh! He's kind of like you in that!\"",
                "The Smails and Kennicott laughed very much at this sly jest. Uncle\n      Whittier seized the conversation. \"That fellow that's working for Hicks?\n      Milksop, that's what he is. Makes me tired to see a young fellow that\n      ought to be in the war, or anyway out in the fields earning his living\n      honest, like I done when I was young, doing a woman's work and then come\n      out and dress up like a show-actor! Why, when I was his age --  -- \"",
                "Carol reflected that the carving-knife would make an excellent dagger with\n      which to kill Uncle Whittier. It would slide in easily. The headlines\n      would be terrible.",
                "Kennicott said judiciously, \"Oh, I don't want to be unjust to him. I\n      believe he took his physical examination for military service. Got\n      varicose veins -- not bad, but enough to disqualify him. Though I will\n      say he doesn't look like a fellow that would be so awful darn crazy to\n      poke his bayonet into a Hun's guts.\"",
                "\"Will! PLEASE!\"",
                "\"Well, he don't. Looks soft to me. And they say he told Del Snafflin, when\n      he was getting a hair-cut on Saturday, that he wished he could play the\n      piano.\"",
                "\"Isn't it wonderful how much we all know about one another in a town like\n      this,\" said Carol innocently.",
                "Kennicott was suspicious, but Aunt Bessie, serving the floating island\n      pudding, agreed, \"Yes, it is wonderful. Folks can get away with all sorts\n      of meannesses and sins in these terrible cities, but they can't here. I\n      was noticing this tailor fellow this morning, and when Mrs. Riggs offered\n      to share her hymn-book with him, he shook his head, and all the while we\n      was singing he just stood there like a bump on a log and never opened his\n      mouth. Everybody says he's got an idea that he's got so much better\n      manners and all than what the rest of us have, but if that's what he calls\n      good manners, I want to know!\"",
                "Carol again studied the carving-knife. Blood on the whiteness of a\n      tablecloth might be gorgeous.",
                "Then:",
                "\"Fool! Neurotic impossibilist! Telling yourself orchard fairy-tales -- at\n      thirty. . . . Dear Lord, am I really THIRTY? That boy can't be more than\n      twenty-five.\"",
                "IV",
                "She went calling.",
                "Boarding with the Widow Bogart was Fern Mullins, a girl of twenty-two who\n      was to be teacher of English, French, and gymnastics in the high school\n      this coming session. Fern Mullins had come to town early, for the\n      six-weeks normal course for country teachers. Carol had noticed her on the\n      street, had heard almost as much about her as about Erik Valborg. She was\n      tall, weedy, pretty, and incurably rakish. Whether she wore a low middy\n      collar or dressed reticently for school in a black suit with a high-necked\n      blouse, she was airy, flippant. \"She looks like an absolute totty,\" said\n      all the Mrs. Sam Clarks, disapprovingly, and all the Juanita Haydocks,\n      enviously.",
                "That Sunday evening, sitting in baggy canvas lawn-chairs beside the house,\n      the Kennicotts saw Fern laughing with Cy Bogart who, though still a junior\n      in high school, was now a lump of a man, only two or three years younger\n      than Fern. Cy had to go downtown for weighty matters connected with the\n      pool-parlor. Fern drooped on the Bogart porch, her chin in her hands.",
                "\"She looks lonely,\" said Kennicott.",
                "\"She does, poor soul. I believe I'll go over and speak to her. I was\n      introduced to her at Dave's but I haven't called.\" Carol was slipping\n      across the lawn, a white figure in the dimness, faintly brushing the dewy\n      grass. She was thinking of Erik and of the fact that her feet were wet,\n      and she was casual in her greeting: \"Hello! The doctor and I wondered if\n      you were lonely.\"",
                "Resentfully, \"I am!\"",
                "Carol concentrated on her. \"My dear, you sound so! I know how it is. I\n      used to be tired when I was on the job -- I was a librarian. What was\n      your college? I was Blodgett.\"",
                "More interestedly, \"I went to the U.\" Fern meant the University of\n      Minnesota.",
                "\"You must have had a splendid time. Blodgett was a bit dull.\"",
                "\"Where were you a librarian?\" challengingly.",
                "\"St. Paul -- the main library.\"",
                "\"Honest? Oh dear, I wish I was back in the Cities! This is my first year\n      of teaching, and I'm scared stiff. I did have the best time in college:\n      dramatics and basket-ball and fussing and dancing -- I'm simply crazy\n      about dancing.

It\n      proved that he had learned to play in Minneapolis; that, next to Juanita\n      Haydock, he had the best serve in town. Tennis was well spoken of in\n      Gopher Prairie and almost never played. There were three courts: one\n      belonging to Harry Haydock, one to the cottages at the lake, and one, a\n      rough field on the outskirts, laid out by a defunct tennis association.",

When he came to Carol he was so excited over being an\n      organizer that he did not stop to talk of himself and Aubrey Beardsley for\n      more than ten minutes. He begged, \"Will you get some of the folks to come\n      in?\" and she nodded agreeably.",

He had asked Harry Haydock to be tentative president. Harry,\n      he reported, had promised, \"All right. You bet. But you go ahead and\n      arrange things, and I'll O.K.

Beyond the\n      court stretched the eternal stubble-fields. The four marionettes,\n      awkwardly going through exercises, insignificant in the hot sweep of\n      contemptuous land, were not heroic; their voices did not ring out in the\n      score, but sounded apologetic; and when the game was over they glanced\n      about as though they were waiting to be laughed at.",

She probably would not have ventured on it had she not spied Nat\n      Hicks in the pool-parlor, being witty over bottle-pool. Erik was alone!\n      She fluttered toward the tailor shop, dashed into its slovenly heat with\n      the comic fastidiousness of a humming bird dipping into a dry tiger-lily.\n      It was after she had entered that she found an excuse.",

He pulled out a blurred sheet of Bristol board and anxiously gave\n      it to her. It was a sketch for a frock.

Pleasant things, small friendly things, and pleasant\n      places -- a field of goldenrod, a pasture by the creek -- and\n      suddenly a wealth of pleasant people.

She\n      was wondering whether her own airs were as laughable as Mrs. Swiftwaite's.\n      She put on the eye-glasses which Kennicott had recently given to her for\n      reading, and looked over a grocery bill.

Gentle mouth and chin. A modest voile blouse with an edging of lace\n      at the neck. A virginal sweetness and timorousness -- no flare of\n      gaiety, no suggestion of cities, music, quick laughter.",

I've got to\n      have one more spree before I'm arrested. Let's get up a picnic down the\n      lake for this afternoon. Won't you come, Mrs. Kennicott, and the doctor?\n      Cy Bogart wants to go -- he's a brat but he's lively.\"",

                "\"How about Erik Valborg? I think he's got lots more style than these town\n      boys. You like him all right, don't you?\"",
                "So the picnic of Carol, Fern, Erik, Cy Bogart, and the Dyers was not only\n      moral but inevitable.",
                "They drove to the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie.\n      Dave Dyer was his most clownish self. He yelped, jigged, wore Carol's hat,\n      dropped an ant down Fern's back, and when they went swimming (the women\n      modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up, the men undressing\n      behind the bushes, constantly repeating, \"Gee, hope we don't run into\n      poison ivy\"), Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife's\n      ankle. He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers\n      he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread\n      on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them.",
                "But Carol could not frolic.",
                "She had made herself young, with parted hair, sailor blouse and large blue\n      bow, white canvas shoes and short linen skirt. Her mirror had asserted\n      that she looked exactly as she had in college, that her throat was smooth,\n      her collar-bone not very noticeable. But she was under restraint. When\n      they swam she enjoyed the freshness of the water but she was irritated by\n      Cy's tricks, by Dave's excessive good spirits. She admired Erik's dance;\n      he could never betray bad taste, as Cy did, and Dave. She waited for him\n      to come to her. He did not come. By his joyousness he had apparently\n      endeared himself to the Dyers. Maud watched him and, after supper, cried\n      to him, \"Come sit down beside me, bad boy!\" Carol winced at his\n      willingness to be a bad boy and come and sit, at his enjoyment of a not\n      very stimulating game in which Maud, Dave, and Cy snatched slices of cold\n      tongue from one another's plates. Maud, it seemed, was slightly dizzy from\n      the swim. She remarked publicly, \"Dr. Kennicott has helped me so much by\n      putting me on a diet,\" but it was to Erik alone that she gave the complete\n      version of her peculiarity in being so sensitive, so easily hurt by the\n      slightest cross word, that she simply had to have nice cheery friends.",
                "Erik was nice and cheery.",
                "Carol assured herself, \"Whatever faults I may have, I certainly couldn't\n      ever be jealous. I do like Maud; she's always so pleasant. But I wonder if\n      she isn't just a bit fond of fishing for men's sympathy? Playing with\n      Erik, and her married --  -- Well --  -- But she looks at him\n      in that languishing, swooning, mid-Victorian way. Disgusting!\"",
                "Cy Bogart lay between the roots of a big birch, smoking his pipe and\n      teasing Fern, assuring her that a week from now, when he was again a\n      high-school boy and she his teacher, he'd wink at her in class. Maud Dyer\n      wanted Erik to \"come down to the beach to see the darling little minnies.\"\n       Carol was left to Dave, who tried to entertain her with humorous accounts\n      of Ella Stowbody's fondness for chocolate peppermints. She watched Maud\n      Dyer put her hand on Erik's shoulder to steady herself.",
                "\"Disgusting!\" she thought.",
                "Cy Bogart covered Fern's nervous hand with his red paw, and when she\n      bounced with half-anger and shrieked, \"Let go, I tell you!\" he grinned and\n      waved his pipe -- a gangling twenty-year-old satyr.",

                "\"What will they think?\" she worried. She saw Maud Dyer peer at Erik with\n      moist possessive eyes. \"Yes! Let's!\" she said.",

                "As the rhythmic oars plopped and creaked, as she floated on an unreality\n      of delicate gray over which the sunset was poured out thin, the irritation\n      of Cy and Maud slipped away. Erik smiled at her proudly. She considered\n      him -- coatless, in white thin shirt. She was conscious of his male\n      differentness, of his flat masculine sides, his thin thighs, his easy\n      rowing. They talked of the library, of the movies. He hummed and she\n      softly sang \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.\" A breeze shivered across the agate\n      lake. The wrinkled water was like armor damascened and polished. The\n      breeze flowed round the boat in a chill current. Carol drew the collar of\n      her middy blouse over her bare throat.",
                "\"Getting cold. Afraid we'll have to go back,\" she said.",

                "\"But you enjoy the 'cutting up!' Maud and you had a beautiful time.\"",
                "\"Why! We just walked on the shore and talked about fishing!\"",
                "She was relieved, and apologetic to her friend Maud. \"Of course. I was\n      joking.\"",
                "\"I'll tell you! Let's land here and sit on the shore -- that bunch of\n      hazel-brush will shelter us from the wind -- and watch the sunset. It's\n      like melted lead. Just a short while! We don't want to go back and listen\n      to them!\"",
                "\"No, but --  -- \" She said nothing while he sped ashore. The keel\n      clashed on the stones. He stood on the forward seat, holding out his hand.\n      They were alone, in the ripple-lapping silence. She rose slowly, slowly\n      stepped over the water in the bottom of the old boat. She took his hand\n      confidently. Unspeaking they sat on a bleached log, in a russet twilight\n      which hinted of autumn. Linden leaves fluttered about them.",
                "\"I wish --  -- Are you cold now?\" he whispered.",
                "\"A little.\" She shivered. But it was not with cold.",
                "\"I wish we could curl up in the leaves there, covered all up, and lie\n      looking out at the dark.\"",
                "\"I wish we could.\" As though it was comfortably understood that he did not\n      mean to be taken seriously.",

                "\"Am I young? Am I? Honestly? Truly?\" She betrayed for a moment the\n      childish, mock-imploring tone that comes into the voice of the most\n      serious woman when an agreeable man treats her as a girl; the childish\n      tone and childish pursed-up lips and shy lift of the cheek.",

                "\"Why?\"",
                "\"It's somewhat late to outline all the history of social custom!\"",
                "\"I know. We must. Are you glad we ran away though?\"",
                "\"Yes.\" She was quiet, perfectly simple. But she rose.",
                "He circled her waist with a brusque arm. She did not resist. She did not\n      care. He was neither a peasant tailor, a potential artist, a social\n      complication, nor a peril. He was himself, and in him, in the personality\n      flowing from him, she was unreasoningly content. In his nearness she\n      caught a new view of his head; the last light brought out the planes of\n      his neck, his flat ruddied cheeks, the side of his nose, the depression of\n      his temples. Not as coy or uneasy lovers but as companions they walked to\n      the boat, and he lifted her up on the prow.",
                "She began to talk intently, as he rowed: \"Erik, you've got to work! You\n      ought to be a personage. You're robbed of your kingdom. Fight for it!

                "As they reached the picnic ground she perceived that it was dark, that\n      they had been gone for a long time.",

                "The others greeted them with the inevitable storm of humor and slight\n      vexation: \"Where the deuce do you think you've been?\" \"You're a fine pair,\n      you are!\" Erik and Carol looked self-conscious; failed in their effort to\n      be witty. All the way home Carol was embarrassed. Once Cy winked at her.\n      That Cy, the Peeping Tom of the garage-loft, should consider her a\n      fellow-sinner --  -- She was furious and frightened and exultant by\n      turns, and in all her moods certain that Kennicott would read her\n      adventuring in her face.",
                "She came into the house awkwardly defiant.",
                "Her husband, half asleep under the lamp, greeted her, \"Well, well, have\n      nice time?\"",
                "She could not answer. He looked at her. But his look did not sharpen. He\n      began to wind his watch, yawning the old \"Welllllll, guess it's about time\n      to turn in.\"",

                "\"Yes, except that I couldn't get Mr. Valborg to say a word. I wanted to\n      ask him about the suit Mr. Hicks is making for my husband. But he insisted\n      on singing. Still, it was restful, floating around on the water and\n      singing. So happy and innocent. Don't you think it's a shame, Mrs. Bogart,\n      that people in this town don't do more nice clean things like that,\n      instead of all this horrible gossiping?\"",

                "Mrs. Bogart sounded vacant. Her bonnet was awry; she was incomparably\n      dowdy. Carol stared at her, felt contemptuous, ready at last to rebel\n      against the trap, and as the rusty goodwife fished again, \"Plannin' some\n      more picnics?\" she flung out, \"I haven't the slightest idea! Oh. Is that\n      Hugh crying? I must run up to him.\"",
                "But up-stairs she remembered that Mrs. Bogart had seen her walking with\n      Erik from the railroad track into town, and she was chilly with\n      disquietude.",
                "At the Jolly Seventeen, two days after, she was effusive to Maud Dyer, to\n      Juanita Haydock. She fancied that every one was watching her, but she\n      could not be sure, and in rare strong moments she did not care. She could\n      rebel against the town's prying now that she had something, however\n      indistinct, for which to rebel.",
                "In a passionate escape there must be not only a place from which to flee\n      but a place to which to flee. She had known that she would gladly leave\n      Gopher Prairie, leave Main Street and all that it signified, but she had\n      had no destination. She had one now. That destination was not Erik Valborg\n      and the love of Erik. She continued to assure herself that she wasn't in\n      love with him but merely \"fond of him, and interested in his success.\" Yet\n      in him she had discovered both her need of youth and the fact that youth\n      would welcome her. It was not Erik to whom she must escape, but universal\n      and joyous youth, in class-rooms, in studios, in offices, in meetings to\n      protest against Things in General. . . . But universal and joyous youth\n      rather resembled Erik.",
                "All week she thought of things she wished to say to him. High, improving\n      things. She began to admit that she was lonely without him. Then she was\n      afraid.",
                "It was at the Baptist church supper, a week after the picnic, that she saw\n      him again. She had gone with Kennicott and Aunt Bessie to the supper,\n      which was spread on oilcloth-covered and trestle-supported tables in the\n      church basement. Erik was helping Myrtle Cass to fill coffee cups for the\n      waitresses. The congregation had doffed their piety. Children tumbled\n      under the tables, and Deacon Pierson greeted the women with a rolling,\n      \"Where's Brother Jones, sister, where's Brother Jones? Not going to be\n      with us tonight? Well, you tell Sister Perry to hand you a plate, and make\n      'em give you enough oyster pie!\"",
                "Erik shared in the cheerfulness. He laughed with Myrtle, jogged her elbow\n      when she was filling cups, made deep mock bows to the waitresses as they\n      came up for coffee. Myrtle was enchanted by his humor. From the other end\n      of the room, a matron among matrons, Carol observed Myrtle, and hated her,\n      and caught herself at it. \"To be jealous of a wooden-faced village girl!\"\n       But she kept it up. She detested Erik; gloated over his gaucheries -- his\n      \"breaks,\" she called them. When he was too expressive, too much like a\n      Russian dancer, in saluting Deacon Pierson, Carol had the ecstasy of pain\n      in seeing the deacon's sneer. When, trying to talk to three girls at once,\n      he dropped a cup and effeminately wailed, \"Oh dear!\" she sympathized with -- and\n      ached over -- the insulting secret glances of the girls.",
                "From meanly hating him she rose to compassion as she saw that his eyes\n      begged every one to like him. She perceived how inaccurate her judgments\n      could be. At the picnic she had fancied that Maud Dyer looked upon Erik\n      too sentimentally, and she had snarled, \"I hate these married women who\n      cheapen themselves and feed on boys.\" But at the supper Maud was one of\n      the waitresses; she bustled with platters of cake, she was pleasant to old\n      women; and to Erik she gave no attention at all. Indeed, when she had her\n      own supper, she joined the Kennicotts, and how ludicrous it was to suppose\n      that Maud was a gourmet of emotions Carol saw in the fact that she talked\n      not to one of the town beaux but to the safe Kennicott himself!",
                "When Carol glanced at Erik again she discovered that Mrs. Bogart had an\n      eye on her. It was a shock to know that at last there was something which\n      could make her afraid of Mrs. Bogart's spying.",
                "\"What am I doing? Am I in love with Erik? Unfaithful? I? I want youth but\n      I don't want him -- I mean, I don't want youth -- enough to break up\n      my life. I must get out of this. Quick.\"",
                "She said to Kennicott on their way home, \"Will! I want to run away for a\n      few days. Wouldn't you like to skip down to Chicago?\"",

                "\"People! To occupy my mind. I want stimulus.\"",
                "\"Stimulus?\" He spoke good-naturedly. \"Who's been feeding you meat? You got\n      that 'stimulus' out of one of these fool stories about wives that don't\n      know when they're well off. Stimulus! Seriously, though, to cut out the\n      jollying, I can't get away.\"",
                "\"Then why don't I run off by myself?\"",
                "\"Why --  -- 'Tisn't the money, you understand. But what about Hugh?\"",
                "\"Leave him with Aunt Bessie. It would be just for a few days.\"",

The clerk\n      said indifferently that he \"guessed\" Miss Mullins was up in Room 37, and\n      left Carol to find the way. She hunted along the stale-smelling corridors\n      with their wallpaper of cerise daisies and poison-green rosettes, streaked\n      in white spots from spilled water, their frayed red and yellow matting,\n      and rows of pine doors painted a sickly blue. She could not find the\n      number. In the darkness at the end of a corridor she had to feel the\n      aluminum figures on the door-panels. She was startled once by a man's\n      voice: \"Yep? Whadyuh want?\" and fled. When she reached the right door she\n      stood listening. She made out a long sobbing. There was no answer till her\n      third knock; then an alarmed \"Who is it? Go away!\"",
                "Her hatred of the town turned resolute as she pushed open the door.",
                "Yesterday she had seen Fern Mullins in boots and tweed skirt and\n      canary-yellow sweater, fleet and self-possessed. Now she lay across the\n      bed, in crumpled lavender cotton and shabby pumps, very feminine, utterly\n      cowed. She lifted her head in stupid terror. Her hair was in tousled\n      strings and her face was sallow, creased. Her eyes were a blur from\n      weeping.",
                "\"I didn't! I didn't!\" was all she would say at first, and she repeated it\n      while Carol kissed her cheek, stroked her hair, bathed her forehead. She\n      rested then, while Carol looked about the room -- the welcome to\n      strangers, the sanctuary of hospitable Main Street, the lucrative property\n      of Kennicott's friend, Jackson Elder. It smelled of old linen and decaying\n      carpet and ancient tobacco smoke. The bed was rickety, with a thin knotty\n      mattress; the sand-colored walls were scratched and gouged; in every\n      corner, under everything, were fluffy dust and cigar ashes; on the tilted\n      wash-stand was a nicked and squatty pitcher; the only chair was a grim\n      straight object of spotty varnish; but there was an altogether splendid\n      gilt and rose cuspidor.",
                "She did not try to draw out Fern's story; Fern insisted on telling it.",
                "She had gone to the party, not quite liking Cy but willing to endure him\n      for the sake of dancing, of escaping from Mrs. Bogart's flow of moral\n      comments, of relaxing after the first strained weeks of teaching. Cy\n      \"promised to be good.\" He was, on the way out. There were a few workmen\n      from Gopher Prairie at the dance, with many young farm-people. Half a\n      dozen squatters from a degenerate colony in a brush-hidden hollow,\n      planters of potatoes, suspected thieves, came in noisily drunk. They all\n      pounded the floor of the barn in old-fashioned square dances, swinging\n      their partners, skipping, laughing, under the incantations of Del Snafflin\n      the barber, who fiddled and called the figures. Cy had two drinks from\n      pocket-flasks. Fern saw him fumbling among the overcoats piled on the\n      feedbox at the far end of the barn; soon after she heard a farmer\n      declaring that some one had stolen his bottle. She taxed Cy with the\n      theft; he chuckled, \"Oh, it's just a joke; I'm going to give it back.\" He\n      demanded that she take a drink. Unless she did, he wouldn't return the\n      bottle.",
                "\"I just brushed my lips with it, and gave it back to him,\" moaned Fern.\n      She sat up, glared at Carol. \"Did you ever take a drink?\"",
                "\"I have. A few. I'd love to have one right now! This contact with\n      righteousness has about done me up!\"",
                "Fern could laugh then. \"So would I! I don't suppose I've had five drinks\n      in my life, but if I meet just one more Bogart and Son --  -- Well,\n      I didn't really touch that bottle -- horrible raw whisky -- though\n      I'd have loved some wine. I felt so jolly. The barn was almost like a\n      stage scene -- the high rafters, and the dark stalls, and tin lanterns\n      swinging, and a silage-cutter up at the end like some mysterious kind of\n      machine. And I'd been having lots of fun dancing with the nicest young\n      farmer, so strong and nice, and awfully intelligent. But I got uneasy when\n      I saw how Cy was. So I doubt if I touched two drops of the beastly stuff.\n      Do you suppose God is punishing me for even wanting wine?\"",
                "\"My dear, Mrs. Bogart's god may be -- Main Street's god. But all the\n      courageous intelligent people are fighting him . . . though he slay us.\"",
                "Fern danced again with the young farmer; she forgot Cy while she was\n      talking with a girl who had taken the University agricultural course. Cy\n      could not have returned the bottle; he came staggering toward her -- taking\n      time to make himself offensive to every girl on the way and to dance a\n      jig. She insisted on their returning. Cy went with her, chuckling and\n      jigging. He kissed her, outside the door. . . . \"And to think I used to\n      think it was interesting to have men kiss you at a dance!\". . . She\n      ignored the kiss, in the need of getting him home before he started a\n      fight. A farmer helped her harness the buggy, while Cy snored in the seat.\n      He awoke before they set out; all the way home he alternately slept and\n      tried to make love to her.",
                "\"I'm almost as strong as he is. I managed to keep him away while I drove -- such\n      a rickety buggy. I didn't feel like a girl; I felt like a scrubwoman -- no,\n      I guess I was too scared to have any feelings at all. It was terribly\n      dark. I got home, somehow. But it was hard, the time I had to get out, and\n      it was quite muddy, to read a sign-post -- I lit matches that I took\n      from Cy's coat pocket, and he followed me -- he fell off the buggy step\n      into the mud, and got up and tried to make love to me, and --  -- I\n      was scared. But I hit him. Quite hard. And got in, and so he ran after the\n      buggy, crying like a baby, and I let him in again, and right away again he\n      was trying --  -- But no matter. I got him home. Up on the porch.\n      Mrs. Bogart was waiting up. . . .",
                "\"You know, it was funny; all the time she was -- oh, talking to me -- and\n      Cy was being terribly sick -- I just kept thinking, 'I've still got to\n      drive the buggy down to the livery stable. I wonder if the livery man will\n      be awake?' But I got through somehow. I took the buggy down to the stable,\n      and got to my room. I locked my door, but Mrs. Bogart kept saying things,\n      outside the door. Stood out there saying things about me, dreadful things,\n      and rattling the knob. And all the while I could hear Cy in the back\n      yard-being sick. I don't think I'll ever marry any man. And then today --  --",
                "\"She drove me right out of the house. She wouldn't listen to me, all\n      morning. Just to Cy. I suppose he's over his headache now. Even at\n      breakfast he thought the whole thing was a grand joke. I suppose right\n      this minute he's going around town boasting about his 'conquest.' You\n      understand -- oh, DON'T you understand? I DID keep him away! But I\n      don't see how I can face my school. They say country towns are fine for\n      bringing up boys in, but --  -- I can't believe this is me, lying\n      here and saying this. I don't BELIEVE what happened last night.",
                "\"Oh. This was curious: When I took off my dress last night -- it was a\n      darling dress, I loved it so, but of course the mud had spoiled it. I\n      cried over it and --  -- No matter. But my white silk stockings were\n      all torn, and the strange thing is, I don't know whether I caught my legs\n      in the briers when I got out to look at the sign-post, or whether Cy\n      scratched me when I was fighting him off.\"",

Each morning,\n      each afternoon, each evening was a compartment divided from all other\n      units of time, distinguished by a sudden \"Oh!

But\n      sometimes he had vanished; he was only an opinion. She worried then about\n      his appearance: Weren't his wrists too large and red? Wasn't his nose a\n      snub, like so many Scandinavians? Was he at all the graceful thing she had\n      fancied? When she encountered him on the street she was as much reassuring\n      herself as rejoicing in his presence. More disturbing than being unable to\n      visualize him was the darting remembrance of some intimate aspect: his\n      face as they had walked to the boat together at the picnic; the ruddy\n      light on his temples, neck-cords, flat cheeks.",

While her mind groped, the lights\n      of a motor car swooped round a bend in the road, and they stood farther\n      apart. \"What ought I to do?\" she mused. \"I think --  -- Oh, I won't\n      be robbed!

She realized that she still carried the damp glove she had\n      stripped off for Erik. She drew it on. She stood in the center of the\n      living-room, unmoving, in damp coat and muddy rubbers.

They jogged from San Diego and La Jolla to Los\n      Angeles, Pasadena, Riverside, through towns with bell-towered missions and\n      orange-groves; they viewed Monterey and San Francisco and a forest of\n      sequoias. They bathed in the surf and climbed foothills and danced, they\n      saw a polo game and the making of motion-pictures, they sent one hundred\n      and seventeen souvenir post-cards to Gopher Prairie, and once, on a dune\n      by a foggy sea when she was walking alone, Carol found an artist, and he\n      looked up at her and said, \"Too damned wet to paint; sit down and talk,\"\n       and so for ten minutes she lived in a romantic novel.",
                "Her only struggle was in coaxing Kennicott not to spend all his time with\n      the tourists from the ten thousand other Gopher Prairies. In winter,\n      California is full of people from Iowa and Nebraska, Ohio and Oklahoma,\n      who, having traveled thousands of miles from their familiar villages,\n      hasten to secure an illusion of not having left them. They hunt for people\n      from their own states to stand between them and the shame of naked\n      mountains; they talk steadily, in Pullmans, on hotel porches, at\n      cafeterias and motion-picture shows, about the motors and crops and county\n      politics back home. Kennicott discussed land-prices with them, he went\n      into the merits of the several sorts of motor cars with them, he was\n      intimate with train porters, and he insisted on seeing the Luke Dawsons at\n      their flimsy bungalow in Pasadena, where Luke sat and yearned to go back\n      and make some more money. But Kennicott gave promise of learning to play.\n      He shouted in the pool at the Coronado, and he spoke of (though he did\n      nothing more radical than speak of) buying evening-clothes. Carol was\n      touched by his efforts to enjoy picture galleries, and the dogged way in\n      which he accumulated dates and dimensions when they followed monkish\n      guides through missions.",

Whenever she was restless she dodged her thoughts by the\n      familiar vagabond fallacy of running away from them, of moving on to a new\n      place, and thus she persuaded herself that she was tranquil. In March she\n      willingly agreed with Kennicott that it was time to go home. She was\n      longing for Hugh.",

Carol waited for him in the station, among\n      huddled German women with shawls and umbrellas, and ragged-bearded farmers\n      in corduroy coats; peasants mute as oxen, in a room thick with the steam\n      of wet coats, the reek of the red-hot stove, the stench of sawdust boxes\n      which served as cuspidors.

The wet snow drenched their gloves;\n      the water underfoot splashed their itching ankles. They scuffled inch by\n      inch for three blocks. In front of Harry Haydock's Kennicott sighed:",

Quite a coincidence!\n      Well, we got to talking, and we called the porter -- that was a pretty\n      good porter on that car -- and we had a couple bottles of ginger ale,\n      and I happened to mention the Kutz Kar, and this man -- seems he's\n      driven a lot of different kinds of cars -- he's got a Franklin now -- and\n      he said that he'd tried the Kutz and liked it first-rate. Well, when we\n      got into a station -- I don't remember the name of it -- Carrie,\n      what the deuce was the name of that first stop we made the other side of\n      Albuquerque? -- well, anyway, I guess we must have stopped there to\n      take on water, and this man and I got out to stretch our legs, and darned\n      if there wasn't a Kutz drawn right up at the depot platform, and he\n      pointed out something I'd never noticed, and I was glad to learn about it:\n      seems that the gear lever in the Kutz is an inch longer --  -- \"",

                "They saw the Ford sedan making its way over the water-lined ice, through\n      the snow-storm, like a tug-boat in a fog. The driver stopped at a corner.\n      The car skidded, it turned about with comic reluctance, crashed into a\n      tree, and stood tilted on a broken wheel.",

Their coats were soaked through.",

                "She noted bare tree-trunks, black branches, the spongy brown earth between\n      patches of decayed snow on the lawns. The vacant lots were full of tall\n      dead weeds. Stripped of summer leaves the houses were hopeless -- temporary\n      shelters.",
                "Kennicott chuckled, \"By golly, look down there! Jack Elder must have\n      painted his garage. And look! Martin Mahoney has put up a new fence around\n      his chicken yard. Say, that's a good fence, eh? Chicken-tight and\n      dog-tight. That's certainly a dandy fence. Wonder how much it cost a yard?\n      Yes, sir, they been building right along, even in winter. Got more\n      enterprise than these Californians. Pretty good to be home, eh?\"",
                "She noted that all winter long the citizens had been throwing garbage into\n      their back yards, to be cleaned up in spring. The recent thaw had\n      disclosed heaps of ashes, dog-bones, torn bedding, clotted paint-cans, all\n      half covered by the icy pools which filled the hollows of the yards. The\n      refuse had stained the water to vile colors of waste: thin red, sour\n      yellow, streaky brown.",

                "The afternoon grew old and dark. Aunt Bessie went home. Carol took the\n      baby into her own room. The maid came in complaining, \"I can't get no\n      extra milk to make chipped beef for supper.\" Hugh was sleepy, and he had\n      been spoiled by Aunt Bessie. Even to a returned mother, his whining and\n      his trick of seven times snatching her silver brush were fatiguing. As a\n      background, behind the noises of Hugh and the kitchen, the house reeked\n      with a colorless stillness.",
                "From the window she heard Kennicott greeting the Widow Bogart as he had\n      always done, always, every snowy evening: \"Guess this 'll keep up all\n      night.\" She waited. There they were, the furnace sounds, unalterable,\n      eternal: removing ashes, shoveling coal.",
                "Yes. She was back home! Nothing had changed. She had never been away.\n      California? Had she seen it? Had she for one minute left this scraping\n      sound of the small shovel in the ash-pit of the furnace? But Kennicott\n      preposterously supposed that she had. Never had she been quite so far from\n      going away as now when he believed she had just come back. She felt oozing\n      through the walls the spirit of small houses and righteous people. At that\n      instant she knew that in running away she had merely hidden her doubts\n      behind the officious stir of travel.",
                "\"Dear God, don't let me begin agonizing again!\" she sobbed. Hugh wept with\n      her.",
                "\"Wait for mummy a second!\" She hastened down to the cellar, to Kennicott.",
                "He was standing before the furnace. However inadequate the rest of the\n      house, he had seen to it that the fundamental cellar should be large and\n      clean, the square pillars whitewashed, and the bins for coal and potatoes\n      and trunks convenient. A glow from the drafts fell on the smooth gray\n      cement floor at his feet. He was whistling tenderly, staring at the\n      furnace with eyes which saw the black-domed monster as a symbol of home\n      and of the beloved routine to which he had returned -- his gipsying\n      decently accomplished, his duty of viewing \"sights\" and \"curios\" performed\n      with thoroughness. Unconscious of her, he stooped and peered in at the\n      blue flames among the coals. He closed the door briskly, and made a\n      whirling gesture with his right hand, out of pure bliss.",
                "He saw her. \"Why, hello, old lady! Pretty darn good to be back, eh?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" she lied, while she quaked, \"Not now. I can't face the job of\n      explaining now. He's been so good. He trusts me. And I'm going to break\n      his heart!\"",
                "She smiled at him. She tidied his sacred cellar by throwing an empty\n      bluing bottle into the trash bin. She mourned, \"It's only the baby that\n      holds me. If Hugh died --  -- \" She fled upstairs in panic and made\n      sure that nothing had happened to Hugh in these four minutes.",
                "She saw a pencil-mark on a window-sill. She had made it on a September day\n      when she had been planning a picnic for Fern Mullins and Erik.

Kennicott was respectful as\n      he inquired whether the Germans had good aeroplanes, and what a salient\n      was, and a cootie, and Going West.",

Iowa farmers were selling their land at\n      four hundred dollars an acre and coming into Minnesota. But whoever bought\n      or sold or mortgaged, the townsmen invited themselves to the feast -- millers,\n      real-estate men, lawyers, merchants, and Dr. Will Kennicott. They bought\n      land at a hundred and fifty, sold it next day at a hundred and seventy,\n      and bought again.

She spoke ill of him at home and in public places,\n      but Kennicott and the other powers insisted, \"Maybe he is kind of a\n      roughneck, but you got to hand it to him; he's got more git-up-and-git\n      than any fellow that ever hit this burg. And he's pretty cute, too. Hear\n      what he said to old Ezra? Chucked him in the ribs and said, 'Say, boy,\n      what do you want to go to Denver for? Wait 'll I get time and I'll move\n      the mountains here. Any mountain will be tickled to death to locate here\n      once we get the White Way in!'\"",

It did\n      not appear that the Great World needed her inspiration, but she felt that\n      her letters, her contact with the anxieties of men and women all over the\n      country, were a part of vast affairs, not confined to Main Street and a\n      kitchen but linked with Paris, Bangkok, Madrid.",

The woman was mystery, romance, a story which told\n      itself differently every day; now she was a murderess, now the neglected\n      wife of an ambassador. It was mystery which Carol had most lacked in\n      Gopher Prairie, where every house was open to view, where every person was\n      but too easy to meet, where there were no secret gates opening upon moors\n      over which one might walk by moss-deadened paths to strange high\n      adventures in an ancient garden.",

Carol recognized in Washington as she had in California a\n      transplanted and guarded Main Street. Two-thirds of the church-members had\n      come from Gopher Prairies. The church was their society and their\n      standard; they went to Sunday service, Sunday School, Christian Endeavor,\n      missionary lectures, church suppers, precisely as they had at home; they\n      agreed that ambassadors and flippant newspapermen and infidel scientists\n      of the bureaus were equally wicked and to be avoided; and by cleaving to\n      Tincomb Church they kept their ideals from all contamination.",

The captain\n      introduced her to the secretary of a congressman, a cynical young widow\n      with many acquaintances in the navy. Through her Carol met commanders and\n      majors, newspapermen, chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the\n      bureaus, and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage\n      headquarters. The teacher took her to headquarters. Carol never became a\n      prominent suffragist. Indeed her only recognized position was as an able\n      addresser of envelopes. But she was casually adopted by this family of\n      friendly women who, when they were not being mobbed or arrested, took\n      dancing lessons or went picnicking up the Chesapeake Canal or talked about\n      the politics of the American Federation of Labor.",
                "With the congressman's secretary and the teacher Carol leased a small\n      flat. Here she found home, her own place and her own people. She had,\n      though it absorbed most of her salary, an excellent nurse for Hugh. She\n      herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays. There were walks\n      with him, there were motionless evenings of reading, but chiefly\n      Washington was associated with people, scores of them, sitting about the\n      flat, talking, talking, talking, not always wisely but always excitedly.\n      It was not at all the \"artist's studio\" of which, because of its\n      persistence in fiction, she had dreamed. Most of them were in offices all\n      day, and thought more in card-catalogues or statistics than in mass and\n      color. But they played, very simply, and they saw no reason why anything\n      which exists cannot also be acknowledged.",
                "She was sometimes shocked quite as she had shocked Gopher Prairie by these\n      girls with their cigarettes and elfish knowledge. When they were most\n      eager about soviets or canoeing, she listened, longed to have some special\n      learning which would distinguish her, and sighed that her adventure had\n      come so late. Kennicott and Main Street had drained her self-reliance; the\n      presence of Hugh made her feel temporary. Some day -- oh, she'd have to\n      take him back to open fields and the right to climb about hay-lofts.",
                "But the fact that she could never be eminent among these scoffing\n      enthusiasts did not keep her from being proud of them, from defending them\n      in imaginary conversations with Kennicott, who grunted (she could hear his\n      voice), \"They're simply a bunch of wild impractical theorists sittin'\n      round chewing the rag,\" and \"I haven't got the time to chase after a lot\n      of these fool fads; I'm too busy putting aside a stake for our old age.\"",
                "Most of the men who came to the flat, whether they were army officers or\n      radicals who hated the army, had the easy gentleness, the acceptance of\n      women without embarrassed banter, for which she had longed in Gopher\n      Prairie. Yet they seemed to be as efficient as the Sam Clarks. She\n      concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation, not hemmed\n      in by the fire of provincial jealousies. Kennicott had asserted that the\n      villager's lack of courtesy is due to his poverty. \"We're no millionaire\n      dudes,\" he boasted. Yet these army and navy men, these bureau experts, and\n      organizers of multitudinous leagues, were cheerful on three or four\n      thousand a year, while Kennicott had, outside of his land speculations,\n      six thousand or more, and Sam had eight.",
                "Nor could she upon inquiry learn that many of this reckless race died in\n      the poorhouse. That institution is reserved for men like Kennicott who,\n      after devoting fifty years to \"putting aside a stake,\" incontinently\n      invest the stake in spurious oil-stocks.",
                "IV",
                "She was encouraged to believe that she had not been abnormal in viewing\n      Gopher Prairie as unduly tedious and slatternly. She found the same faith\n      not only in girls escaped from domesticity but also in demure old ladies\n      who, tragically deprived of esteemed husbands and huge old houses, yet\n      managed to make a very comfortable thing of it by living in small flats\n      and having time to read.",
                "But she also learned that by comparison Gopher Prairie was a model of\n      daring color, clever planning, and frenzied intellectuality. From her\n      teacher-housemate she had a sardonic description of a Middlewestern\n      railroad-division town, of the same size as Gopher Prairie but devoid of\n      lawns and trees, a town where the tracks sprawled along the cinder-scabbed\n      Main Street, and the railroad shops, dripping soot from eaves and doorway,\n      rolled out smoke in greasy coils.",
                "Other towns she came to know by anecdote: a prairie village where the wind\n      blew all day long, and the mud was two feet thick in spring, and in summer\n      the flying sand scarred new-painted houses and dust covered the few\n      flowers set out in pots. New England mill-towns with the hands living in\n      rows of cottages like blocks of lava. A rich farming-center in New Jersey,\n      off the railroad, furiously pious, ruled by old men, unbelievably ignorant\n      old men, sitting about the grocery talking of James G. Blaine. A Southern\n      town, full of the magnolias and white columns which Carol had accepted as\n      proof of romance, but hating the negroes, obsequious to the Old Families.\n      A Western mining-settlement like a tumor. A booming semi-city with parks\n      and clever architects, visited by famous pianists and unctuous lecturers,\n      but irritable from a struggle between union labor and the manufacturers'\n      association, so that in even the gayest of the new houses there was a\n      ceaseless and intimidating heresy-hunt.",
                "V",
                "The chart which plots Carol's progress is not easy to read. The lines are\n      broken and uncertain of direction; often instead of rising they sink in\n      wavering scrawls; and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray\n      of rubbed pencil marks. A few lines are traceable.",
                "Unhappy women are given to protecting their sensitiveness by cynical\n      gossip, by whining, by high-church and new-thought religions, or by a fog\n      of vagueness. Carol had hidden in none of these refuges from reality, but\n      she, who was tender and merry, had been made timorous by Gopher Prairie.\n      Even her flight had been but the temporary courage of panic. The thing she\n      gained in Washington was not information about office-systems and labor\n      unions but renewed courage, that amiable contempt called poise. Her\n      glimpse of tasks involving millions of people and a score of nations\n      reduced Main Street from bloated importance to its actual pettiness. She\n      could never again be quite so awed by the power with which she herself had\n      endowed the Vidas and Blaussers and Bogarts.",
                "From her work and from her association with women who had organized\n      suffrage associations in hostile cities, or had defended political\n      prisoners, she caught something of an impersonal attitude; saw that she\n      had been as touchily personal as Maud Dyer.",
                "And why, she began to ask, did she rage at individuals? Not individuals\n      but institutions are the enemies, and they most afflict the disciples who\n      the most generously serve them. They insinuate their tyranny under a\n      hundred guises and pompous names, such as Polite Society, the Family, the\n      Church, Sound Business, the Party, the Country, the Superior White Race;\n      and the only defense against them, Carol beheld, is unembittered laughter."

                "She was having tea and cinnamon toast, alone at a small round table on the\n      balcony of Rauscher's Confiserie. Four debutantes clattered in. She had\n      felt young and dissipated, had thought rather well of her black and\n      leaf-green suit, but as she watched them, thin of ankle, soft under the\n      chin, seventeen or eighteen at most, smoking cigarettes with the correct\n      ennui and talking of \"bedroom farces\" and their desire to \"run up to New\n      York and see something racy,\" she became old and rustic and plain, and\n      desirous of retreating from these hard brilliant children to a life easier\n      and more sympathetic. When they flickered out and one child gave orders to\n      a chauffeur, Carol was not a defiant philosopher but a faded government\n      clerk from Gopher Prairie, Minnesota.",
                "She started dejectedly up Connecticut Avenue. She stopped, her heart\n      stopped. Coming toward her were Harry and Juanita Haydock. She ran to\n      them, she kissed Juanita, while Harry confided, \"Hadn't expected to come\n      to Washington -- had to go to New York for some buying -- didn't\n      have your address along -- just got in this morning -- wondered how\n      in the world we could get hold of you.\"",
                "She was definitely sorry to hear that they were to leave at nine that\n      evening, and she clung to them as long as she could. She took them to St.\n      Mark's for dinner. Stooped, her elbows on the table, she heard with\n      excitement that \"Cy Bogart had the 'flu, but of course he was too gol-darn\n      mean to die of it.\"",
                "\"Will wrote me that Mr. Blausser has gone away. How did he get on?\"",

                "When the news had been told and their enthusiasm had slackened she looked\n      about and was proud to be able to point out a senator, to explain the\n      cleverness of the canopied garden. She fancied that a man with dinner-coat\n      and waxed mustache glanced superciliously at Harry's highly form-fitting\n      bright-brown suit and Juanita's tan silk frock, which was doubtful at the\n      seams. She glared back, defending her own, daring the world not to\n      appreciate them.",

The film was a highly advertised and\n      abysmal thing smacking of simpering hair-dressers, cheap perfume,\n      red-plush suites on the back streets of tenderloins, and complacent fat\n      women chewing gum. It pretended to deal with the life of studios. The\n      leading man did a portrait which was a masterpiece. He also saw visions in\n      pipe-smoke, and was very brave and poor and pure. He had ringlets, and his\n      masterpiece was strangely like an enlarged photograph.",

                "She went home and read Kennicott's letters. They had seemed stiff and\n      undetailed, but now there strode from them a personality, a personality\n      unlike that of the languishing young man in the velvet jacket playing a\n      dummy piano in a canvas room.",
                "IV",
                "Kennicott first came to see her in November, thirteen months after her\n      arrival in Washington. When he announced that he was coming she was not at\n      all sure that she wished to see him. She was glad that he had made the\n      decision himself.",
                "She had leave from the office for two days.",
                "She watched him marching from the train, solid, assured, carrying his\n      heavy suit-case, and she was diffident -- he was such a bulky person to\n      handle. They kissed each other questioningly, and said at the same time,\n      \"You're looking fine; how's the baby?\" and \"You're looking awfully well,\n      dear; how is everything?\"",
                "He grumbled, \"I don't want to butt in on any plans you've made or your\n      friends or anything, but if you've got time for it, I'd like to chase\n      around Washington, and take in some restaurants and shows and stuff, and\n      forget work for a while.\"",
                "She realized, in the taxicab, that he was wearing a soft gray suit, a soft\n      easy hat, a flippant tie.",

                "They spent half an hour at the flat, with Hugh. She was flustered, but he\n      gave no sign of kissing her again.",
                "As he moved about the small rooms she realized that he had had his new tan\n      shoes polished to a brassy luster. There was a recent cut on his chin. He\n      must have shaved on the train just before coming into Washington.",
                "It was pleasant to feel how important she was, how many people she\n      recognized, as she took him to the Capitol, as she told him (he asked and\n      she obligingly guessed) how many feet it was to the top of the dome, as\n      she pointed out Senator LaFollette and the vice-president, and at\n      lunch-time showed herself an habitue by leading him through the catacombs\n      to the senate restaurant.",
                "She realized that he was slightly more bald. The familiar way in which his\n      hair was parted on the left side agitated her. She looked down at his\n      hands, and the fact that his nails were as ill-treated as ever touched her\n      more than his pleading shoe-shine.",
                "\"You'd like to motor down to Mount Vernon this afternoon, wouldn't you?\"\n       she said.",
                "It was the one thing he had planned. He was delighted that it seemed to be\n      a perfectly well bred and Washingtonian thing to do.",
                "He shyly held her hand on the way, and told her the news: they were\n      excavating the basement for the new schoolbuilding, Vida \"made him tired\n      the way she always looked at the Maje,\" poor Chet Dashaway had been killed\n      in a motor accident out on the Coast. He did not coax her to like him. At\n      Mount Vernon he admired the paneled library and Washington's dental tools.",
                "She knew that he would want oysters, that he would have heard of Harvey's\n      apropos of Grant and Blaine, and she took him there. At dinner his hearty\n      voice, his holiday enjoyment of everything, turned into nervousness in his\n      desire to know a number of interesting matters, such as whether they still\n      were married. But he did not ask questions, and he said nothing about her\n      returning. He cleared his throat and observed, \"Oh say, been trying out\n      the old camera. Don't you think these are pretty good?\"",
                "He tossed over to her thirty prints of Gopher Prairie and the country\n      about. Without defense, she was thrown into it. She remembered that he had\n      lured her with photographs in courtship days; she made a note of his\n      sameness, his satisfaction with the tactics which had proved good before;\n      but she forgot it in the familiar places. She was seeing the sun-speckled\n      ferns among birches on the shore of Minniemashie, wind-rippled miles of\n      wheat, the porch of their own house where Hugh had played, Main Street\n      where she knew every window and every face.",
                "She handed them back, with praise for his photography, and he talked of\n      lenses and time-exposures.",
                "Dinner was over and they were gossiping of her friends at the flat, but an\n      intruder was with them, sitting back, persistent, inescapable. She could\n      not endure it. She stammered:",
                "\"I had you check your bag at the station because I wasn't quite sure where\n      you'd stay. I'm dreadfully sorry we haven't room to put you up at the\n      flat. We ought to have seen about a room for you before. Don't you think\n      you better call up the Willard or the Washington now?\"",
                "He peered at her cloudily. Without words he asked, without speech she\n      answered, whether she was also going to the Willard or the Washington. But\n      she tried to look as though she did not know that they were debating\n      anything of the sort. She would have hated him had he been meek about it.\n      But he was neither meek nor angry. However impatient he may have been with\n      her blandness he said readily:",
                "\"Yes, guess I better do that. Excuse me a second. Then how about grabbing\n      a taxi (Gosh, isn't it the limit the way these taxi shuffers skin around a\n      corner? Got more nerve driving than I have!) and going up to your flat for\n      a while? Like to meet your friends -- must be fine women -- and I\n      might take a look and see how Hugh sleeps. Like to know how he breathes.\n      Don't think he has adenoids, but I better make sure, eh?\" He patted her\n      shoulder.",
                "At the flat they found her two housemates and a girl who had been to jail\n      for suffrage. Kennicott fitted in surprisingly. He laughed at the girl's\n      story of the humors of a hunger-strike; he told the secretary what to do\n      when her eyes were tired from typing; and the teacher asked him -- not\n      as the husband of a friend but as a physician -- whether there was\n      \"anything to this inoculation for colds.\"",
                "His colloquialisms seemed to Carol no more lax than their habitual slang.",
                "Like an older brother he kissed her good-night in the midst of the\n      company.",
                "\"He's terribly nice,\" said her housemates, and waited for confidences.\n      They got none, nor did her own heart. She could find nothing definite to\n      agonize about. She felt that she was no longer analyzing and controlling\n      forces, but swept on by them.",
                "He came to the flat for breakfast, and washed the dishes. That was her\n      only occasion for spite. Back home he never thought of washing dishes!",
                "She took him to the obvious \"sights\" -- the Treasury, the Monument, the\n      Corcoran Gallery, the Pan-American Building, the Lincoln Memorial, with\n      the Potomac beyond it and the Arlington hills and the columns of the Lee\n      Mansion. For all his willingness to play there was over him a melancholy\n      which piqued her. His normally expressionless eyes had depths to them now,\n      and strangeness. As they walked through Lafayette Square, looking past the\n      Jackson statue at the lovely tranquil facade of the White House, he\n      sighed, \"I wish I'd had a shot at places like this. When I was in the U.,\n      I had to earn part of my way, and when I wasn't doing that or studying, I\n      guess I was roughhousing. My gang were a great bunch for bumming around\n      and raising Cain. Maybe if I'd been caught early and sent to concerts and\n      all that --  -- Would I have been what you call intelligent?\"",
                "\"Oh, my dear, don't be humble! You are intelligent! For instance, you're\n      the most thorough doctor --  -- \"",
                "He was edging about something he wished to say. He pounced on it:",
                "\"You did like those pictures of G. P. pretty well, after all, didn't you!\"",
                "\"Yes, of course.\"",
                "\"Wouldn't be so bad to have a glimpse of the old town, would it!\"",
                "\"No, it wouldn't. Just as I was terribly glad to see the Haydocks. But\n      please understand me! That doesn't mean that I withdraw all my criticisms.\n      The fact that I might like a glimpse of old friends hasn't any particular\n      relation to the question of whether Gopher Prairie oughtn't to have\n      festivals and lamb chops.\"",
                "Hastily, \"No, no! Sure not. I und'stand.\"",
                "\"But I know it must have been pretty tiresome to have to live with anybody\n      as perfect as I was.\"",

                "V",
                "He was thrilled by old negro coachmen, admirals, aeroplanes, the building\n      to which his income tax would eventually go, a Rolls-Royce, Lynnhaven\n      oysters, the Supreme Court Room, a New York theatrical manager down for\n      the try-out of a play, the house where Lincoln died, the cloaks of Italian\n      officers, the barrows at which clerks buy their box-lunches at noon, the\n      barges on the Chesapeake Canal, and the fact that District of Columbia\n      cars had both District and Maryland licenses.",
                "She resolutely took him to her favorite white and green cottages and\n      Georgian houses. He admitted that fanlights, and white shutters against\n      rosy brick, were more homelike than a painty wooden box. He volunteered,\n      \"I see how you mean. They make me think of these pictures of an\n      old-fashioned Christmas. Oh, if you keep at it long enough you'll have Sam\n      and me reading poetry and everything.

When I say that I'm selfish I mean that\n      the only thing I consider about women is whether they're likely to prove\n      useful in building up real political power for women. And you? Shall I be\n      frank? Remember when I say 'you' I don't mean you alone. I'm thinking of\n      thousands of women who come to Washington and New York and Chicago every\n      year, dissatisfied at home and seeking a sign in the heavens -- women\n      of all sorts, from timid mothers of fifty in cotton gloves, to girls just\n      out of Vassar who organize strikes in their own fathers' factories! All of\n      you are more or less useful to me, but only a few of you can take my\n      place, because I have one virtue (only one): I have given up father and\n      mother and children for the love of God.",
                "\"Here's the test for you: Do you come to 'conquer the East,' as people\n      say, or do you come to conquer yourself?",
                "\"It's so much more complicated than any of you know -- so much more\n      complicated than I knew when I put on Ground Grippers and started out to\n      reform the world. The final complication in 'conquering Washington' or\n      'conquering New York' is that the conquerors must beyond all things not\n      conquer! It must have been so easy in the good old days when authors\n      dreamed only of selling a hundred thousand volumes, and sculptors of being\n      feted in big houses, and even the Uplifters like me had a simple-hearted\n      ambition to be elected to important offices and invited to go round\n      lecturing. But we meddlers have upset everything. Now the one thing that\n      is disgraceful to any of us is obvious success. The Uplifter who is very\n      popular with wealthy patrons can be pretty sure that he has softened his\n      philosophy to please them, and the author who is making lots of money -- poor\n      things, I've heard 'em apologizing for it to the shabby bitter-enders;\n      I've seen 'em ashamed of the sleek luggage they got from movie rights.",
                "\"Do you want to sacrifice yourself in such a topsy-turvy world, where\n      popularity makes you unpopular with the people you love, and the only\n      failure is cheap success, and the only individualist is the person who\n      gives up all his individualism to serve a jolly ungrateful proletariat\n      which thumbs its nose at him?\"",
                "Carol smiled ingratiatingly, to indicate that she was indeed one who\n      desired to sacrifice, but she sighed, \"I don't know; I'm afraid I'm not\n      heroic. I certainly wasn't out home. Why didn't I do big effective --  -- \"",
                "\"Not a matter of heroism. Matter of endurance. Your Middlewest is\n      double-Puritan -- prairie Puritan on top of New England Puritan; bluff\n      frontiersman on the surface, but in its heart it still has the ideal of\n      Plymouth Rock in a sleet-storm. There's one attack you can make on it,\n      perhaps the only kind that accomplishes much anywhere: you can keep on\n      looking at one thing after another in your home and church and bank, and\n      ask why it is, and who first laid down the law that it had to be that way.\n      If enough of us do this impolitely enough, then we'll become civilized in\n      merely twenty thousand years or so, instead of having to wait the two\n      hundred thousand years that my cynical anthropologist friends allow. . . .\n      Easy, pleasant, lucrative home-work for wives: asking people to define\n      their jobs. That's the most dangerous doctrine I know!\"",

The prairie was no longer empty land in the\n      sun-glare; it was the living tawny beast which she had fought and made\n      beautiful by fighting; and in the village streets were shadows of her\n      desires and the sound of her marching and the seeds of mystery and\n      greatness.",

She remembered that Kennicott and Sam Clark had\n      listened to her songs, and she wanted to run to them and sing.",

                "\"Yes, it would jar you to have Bert butting in,\" he said amiably. \"Are you\n      going to do much fussing over this Community stunt? Don't you ever get\n      tired of fretting and stewing and experimenting?\"",
                "\"I haven't even started. Look!\" She led him to the nursery door, pointed\n      at the fuzzy brown head of her daughter. \"Do you see that object on the\n      pillow? Do you know what it is? It's a bomb to blow up smugness. If you\n      Tories were wise, you wouldn't arrest anarchists; you'd arrest all these\n      children while they're asleep in their cribs. Think what that baby will\n      see and meddle with before she dies in the year 2000! She may see an\n      industrial union of the whole world, she may see aeroplanes going to\n      Mars.\"",
                "\"Yump, probably be changes all right,\" yawned Kennicott.",
                "She sat on the edge of his bed while he hunted through his bureau for a\n      collar which ought to be there and persistently wasn't.",
                "\"I'll go on, always. And I am happy. But this Community Day makes me see\n      how thoroughly I'm beaten.\"",
                "\"That darn collar certainly is gone for keeps,\" muttered Kennicott and,\n      louder, \"Yes, I guess you --  -- I didn't quite catch what you said,\n      dear.\"",
                "She patted his pillows, turned down his sheets, as she reflected:",
                "\"But I have won in this: I've never excused my failures by sneering at my\n      aspirations, by pretending to have gone beyond them. I do not admit that\n      Main Street is as beautiful as it should be! I do not admit that Gopher\n      Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe! I do not admit that\n      dish-washing is enough to satisfy all women! I may not have fought the\n      good fight, but I have kept the faith.\"",
                "\"Sure. You bet you have,\" said Kennicott. \"Well, good night. Sort of feels\n      to me like it might snow tomorrow. Have to be thinking about putting up\n      the storm-windows pretty soon. Say, did you notice whether the girl put\n      that screwdriver back?\""
