                "SCENE -- A room with lighted fire, and a door into the open air,\n      through which one sees, perhaps, the trees of a wood, and these trees\n      should be painted in flat colour upon a gold or diapered sky. The walls\n      are of one colour. The scene should have the effect of missal Painting.\n      MARY, a woman of forty years or so, is grinding a quern.",
                "MARY. What can have made the grey hen flutter so?",
                "(TEIG, a boy of fourteen, is coming in with turf, which he lays beside the\n      hearth.)",
                "TEIG. They say that now the land is famine struck The graves are walking.",
                "MARY. There is something that the hen hears.",
                "TEIG. And that is not the worst; at Tubber-vanach A woman met a man with\n      ears spread out, And they moved up and down like a bat's wing.",
                "MARY. What can have kept your father all this while?",
                "TEIG. Two nights ago, at Carrick-orus churchyard, A herdsman met a man who\n      had no mouth, Nor eyes, nor ears; his face a wall of flesh; He saw him\n      plainly by the light of the moon.",
                "MARY. Look out, and tell me if your father's coming.",
                "(TEIG goes to door.)",
                "TEIG. Mother!",
                "MARY. What is it?",
                "TEIG. In the bush beyond, There are two birds -- if you can call them\n      birds --  I could not see them rightly for the leaves. But they've the\n      shape and colour of horned owls And I'm half certain they've a human face.",
                "MARY. Mother of God, defend us!",
                "TEIG. They're looking at me. What is the good of praying? father says. God\n      and the Mother of God have dropped asleep. What do they care, he says,\n      though the whole land Squeal like a rabbit under a weasel's tooth?",
                "MARY. You'll bring misfortune with your blasphemies Upon your father, or\n      yourself, or me. I would to God he were home -- ah, there he is.",
                "(SHEMUS comes in.)",
                "What was it kept you in the wood? You know I cannot get all sorts of\n      accidents Out of my mind till you are home again.",
                "SHEMUS. I'm in no mood to listen to your clatter. Although I tramped the\n      woods for half a day, I've taken nothing, for the very rats, Badgers, and\n      hedgehogs seem to have died of drought, And there was scarce a wind in the\n      parched leaves.",
                "TEIG. Then you have brought no dinner.",
                "SHEMUS. After that I sat among the beggars at the cross-roads, And held a\n      hollow hand among the others.",
                "MARY. What, did you beg?",
                "SHEMUS. I had no chance to beg, For when the beggars saw me they cried out\n      They would not have another share their alms, And hunted me away with\n      sticks and stones.",
                "TEIG. You said that you would bring us food or money.",
                "SHEMUS. What's in the house?",
                "TEIG. A bit of mouldy bread.",
                "MARY. There's flour enough to make another loaf.",
                "TEIG. And when that's gone?",
                "MARY. There is the hen in the coop.",
                "SHEMUS. My curse upon the beggars, my Curse upon them!",
                "TEIG. And the last penny gone.",
                "SHEMUS. When the hen's gone, What can we do but live on sorrel and dock)\n      And dandelion, till our mouths are green?",
                "MARY. God, that to this hour's found bit and sup, Will cater for us still.",
                "SHEMUS. His kitchen's bare. There were five doors that I looked through\n      this day And saw the dead and not a soul to wake them.",
                "MARY. Maybe He'd have us die because He knows, When the ear is stopped and\n      when the eye is stopped, That every wicked sight is hid from the eye, And\n      all fool talk from the ear.",
                "SHEMUS. Who's passing there? And mocking us with music?",
                "(A stringed instrument without.)",
                "TEIG. A young man plays it, There's an old woman and a lady with him.",
                "SHEMUS. What is the trouble of the poor to her? Nothing at all or a harsh\n      radishy sauce For the day's meat.",
                "MARY. God's pity on the rich, Had we been through as many doors, and seen\n      The dishes standing on the polished wood In the wax candle light, we'd be\n      as hard, And there's the needle's eye at the end of all.",
                "SHEMUS. My curse upon the rich.",
                "TEIG. They're coming here.",
                "SHEMUS. Then down upon that stool, down quick, I say, And call up a whey\n      face and a whining voice, And let your head be bowed upon your knees.",
                "MARY. Had I but time to put the place to rights.",
                "(CATHLEEN, OONA, and ALEEL enter.)",
                "CATHLEEN. God save all here. There is a certain house, An old grey castle\n      with a kitchen garden, A cider orchard and a plot for flowers, Somewhere\n      among these woods.",
                "MARY. We know it, lady. A place that's set among impassable walls As\n      though world's trouble could not find it out.",
                "CATHLEEN. It may be that we are that trouble, for we --  Although we've\n      wandered in the wood this hour --  Have lost it too, yet I should know\n      my way, For I lived all my childhood in that house.",
                "MARY. Then you are Countess Cathleen?",
                "CATHLEEN. And this woman, Oona, my nurse, should have remembered it, For\n      we were happy for a long time there.",
                "OONA. The paths are overgrown with thickets now, Or else some change has\n      come upon my sight.",
                "CATHLEEN. And this young man, that should have known the woods -- \n      Because we met him on their border but now, Wandering and singing like a\n      wave of the sea --  Is so wrapped up in dreams of terrors to come That\n      he can give no help.",
                "MARY. You have still some way, But I can put you on the trodden path Your\n      servants take when they are marketing. But first sit down and rest\n      yourself awhile, For my old fathers served your fathers, lady, Longer than\n      books can tell -- and it were strange If you and yours should not be\n      welcome here.",
                "CATHLEEN. And it were stranger still were I ungrateful For such kind\n      welcome but I must be gone, For the night's gathering in.",
                "SHEMUS. It is a long while Since I've set eyes on bread or on what buys\n      it.",
                "CATHLEEN. So you are starving even in this wood, Where I had thought I\n      would find nothing changed. But that's a dream, for the old worm o' the\n      world Can eat its way into what place it pleases.",
                "(She gives money.)",
                "TEIG. Beautiful lady, give me something too; I fell but now, being weak\n      with hunger and thirst, And lay upon the threshold like a log.",
                "CATHLEEN. I gave for all and that was all I had. Look, my purse is empty.\n      I have passed By starving men and women all this day, And they have had\n      the rest; but take the purse, The silver clasps on't may be worth a\n      trifle. But if you'll come to-morrow to my house You shall have twice the\n      sum.",
                "(ALEEL begins to play.)",
                "SHEMUS (muttering). What, music, music!",
                "CATHLEEN. Ah, do not blame the finger on the string; The doctors bid me\n      fly the unlucky times And find distraction for my thoughts, or else Pine\n      to my grave.",
                "SHEMUS. I have said nothing, lady. Why should the like of us complain?",
                "OONA. Have done. Sorrows that she's but read of in a book Weigh on her\n      mind as if they had been her own.",
                "(OONA, MARY, and CATHLEEN go Out. ALEEL looks defiantly at SHEMUS.)",
                "ALEEL. (Singing) Impetuous heart, be still, be still, Your sorrowful love\n      can never be told, Cover it up with a lonely tune, He that could bend all\n      things to His will Has covered the door of the infinite fold With the pale\n      stars and the wandering moon.",
                "(He takes a step towards the door and then turns again.)",
                "Shut to the door before the night has fallen, For who can say what walks,\n      or in what shape Some devilish creature flies in the air, but now Two\n      grey-horned owls hooted above our heads.",
                "(He goes out, his singing dies away. MARY comes in. SHEmus has been\n      counting the money.)",
                "TEIG. There's no good luck in owls, but it may be That the ill luck's to\n      fall upon their heads.",
                "MARY. You never thanked her ladyship.",
                "SHEMUS. Thank her, For seven halfpence and a silver bit?",
                "TEIG. But for this empty purse?",
                "SHEMUS. What's that for thanks, Or what's the double of it that she\n      promised? With bread and flesh and every sort of food Up to a price no man\n      has heard the like of And rising every day.",
                "MARY. We have all she had; She emptied out the purse before our eyes.",
                "SHEMUS (to MARY, who has gone to close the door) Leave that door open.",
                "MARY. When those that have read books, And seen the seven wonders of the\n      world, Fear what's above or what's below the ground, It's time that\n      poverty should bolt the door.",
                "SHEMUS. I'll have no bolts, for there is not a thing That walks above the\n      ground or under it I had not rather welcome to this house Than any more of\n      mankind, rich or poor.",
                "TEIG. So that they brought us money.",
                "SHEMUS. I heard say There's something that appears like a white bird, A\n      pigeon or a seagull or the like, But if you hit it with a stone or a stick\n      It clangs as though it had been made of brass; And that if you dig down\n      where it was scratching You'll find a crock of gold.",
                "TEIG. But dream of gold For three nights running, and there's always gold.",
                "SHEMUS. You might be starved before you've dug it out.",
                "TEIG. But maybe if you called, something would come, They have been seen\n      of late.",
                "MARY. Is it call devils? Call devils from the wood, call them in here?",
                "SHEMUS. So you'd stand up against me, and you'd say Who or what I am to\n      welcome here.",
                "(He hits her.)",
                "That is to show who's master.",

                "MARY. God help us all!",
                "SHEMUS. Pray, if you have a mind to. it's little that the sleepy ears\n      above Care for your words; but I'll call what I please.",
                "TEIG. There is many a one, they say, had money from them.",
                "SHEMUS. (at door) Whatever you are that walk the woods at night, So be it\n      that you have not shouldered up Out of a grave -- for I'll have nothing\n      human --  And have free hands, a friendly trick of speech, I welcome\n      you. Come, sit beside the fire. What matter if your head's below your arms\n      Or you've a horse's tail to whip your flank, Feathers instead of hair,\n      that's but a straw, Come, share what bread and meat is in the house, And\n      stretch your heels and warm them in the ashes. And after that, let's share\n      and share alike And curse all men and women. Come in, come in. What, is\n      there no one there?",

A man dressed as an Eastern merchant comes\n      in carrying a small carpet. He unrolls it and sits cross-legged at one end\n      of it. Another man dressed in the same way follows, and sits at the other\n      end. This is done slowly and deliberately. When they are seated they take\n      money out of embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on\n      the carpet.",
                "TEIG. You speak to them.",

                "SHEMUS. (coming nearer) I'd make so bold, if you would pardon it, To ask\n      if there's a thing you'd have of us. Although we are but poor people, if\n      there is, Why, if there is --",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. We've travelled a long road, For we are merchants that\n      must tramp the world, And now we look for supper and a fire And a safe\n      corner to count money in.",
                "SHEMUS. I thought you were.... but that's no matter now --  There had\n      been words between my wife and me Because I said I would be master here,\n      And ask in what I pleased or who I pleased And so.... but that is nothing\n      to the point, Because it's certain that you are but merchants.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. We travel for the Master of all merchants.",
                "SHEMUS. Yet if you were that I had thought but now I'd welcome you no\n      less. Be what you please And you'll have supper at the market rate, That\n      means that what was sold for but a penny Is now worth fifty.",
                "(MERCHANTS begin putting money on carpet.)",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. Our Master bids us pay So good a price, that all who deal\n      with us Shall eat, drink, and be merry.",
                "SHEMUS. (to MARY) Bestir yourself, Go kill and draw the fowl, while Teig\n      and I Lay out the plates and make a better fire.",
                "MARY. I will not cook for you.",
                "SHEMUS. Not cook! not cook! Do not be angry. She wants to pay me back\n      Because I struck her in that argument. But she'll get sense again. Since\n      the dearth came We rattle one on another as though we were Knives thrown\n      into a basket to be cleaned.",
                "MARY. I will not cook for you, because I know In what unlucky shape you\n      sat but now Outside this door.",
                "TEIG. It's this, your honours: Because of some wild words my father said\n      She thinks you are not of those who cast a shadow.",
                "SHEMUS. I said I'd make the devils of the wood Welcome, if they'd a mind\n      to eat and drink; But it is certain that you are men like us.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. It's strange that she should think we cast no shadow, For\n      there is nothing on the ridge of the world That's more substantial than\n      the merchants are That buy and sell you.",
                "MARY. If you are not demons, And seeing what great wealth is spread out\n      there, Give food or money to the starving poor.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. If we knew how to find deserving poor We'd do our share.",
                "MARY. But seek them patiently.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. We know the evils of mere charity.",
                "MARY. Those scruples may befit a common time. I had thought there was a\n      pushing to and fro, At times like this, that overset the scale And\n      trampled measure down.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. But if already We'd thought of a more prudent way than\n      that?",

                "FIRST MERCHANT. We will ask nothing but what all men have.",
                "MARY. Their swine and cattle, fields and implements Are sold and gone.",
                "FIRST MERCHANT. They have not sold all yet. For there's a vaporous thing -- that\n      may be nothing, But that's the buyer's risk -- a second self, They call\n      immortal for a story's sake.",
                "SHEMUS. You come to buy our souls?",

                "MARY. Teig and Shemus --",
                "SHEMUS. What can it be but nothing? What has God poured out of His bag but\n      famine? Satan gives money.",

                "I found the story of the Countess Cathleen in what professed to be a\n      collection of Irish folk-lore in an Irish newspaper some years ago. I\n      wrote to the compiler, asking about its source, but got no answer, but\n      have since heard that it was translated from Les Matin`ees de Timoth`e\n      Trimm a good many years ago, and has been drifting about the Irish press\n      ever since. L`eo Lesp`es gives it as an Irish story, and though the editor\n      of Folklore has kindly advertised for information, the only Christian\n      variant I know of is a Donegal tale, given by Mr. Larminie in his West\n      Irish Folk Tales and Romances, of a woman who goes to hell for ten years\n      to save her husband, and stays there another ten, having been granted\n      permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt. L`eo\n      Lesp`es may have added a few details, but I have no doubt of the essential\n      antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the\n      supreme parables of the world. The parable came to the Greeks in the\n      sacrifice of Alcestis, but her sacrifice was less overwhelming, less\n      apparently irremediable. L`eo Lesp`es tells the story as follows: --",

                "N'est ce pas que ce r`ecit, n`e de l'imagination des po`etes catholiques\n      de la verte Erin, est une V`eritable r`ecit de car`eme?",
                "The Countess Cathleen was acted in Dublin in 1899, with Mr. Marcus St.\n      John and Mr. Trevor Lowe as the First and Second Demon, Mr. Valentine\n      Grace as Shemus Rua, Master Charles Sefton as Teig, Madame San Carola as\n      Mary, Miss Florence Farr as Aleel, Miss Anna Mather as Oona, Mr. Charles\n      Holmes as the Herdsman, Mr. Jack Wilcox as the Gardener, Mr. Walford as a\n      Peasant, Miss Dorothy Paget as a Spirit, Miss M. Kelly as a Peasant Woman,\n      Mr. T. E. Wilkinson as a Servant, and Miss May Whitty as The Countess\n      Kathleen. They had to face a very vehement opposition stirred up by a\n      politician and a newspaper, the one accusing me in a pamphlet, the other\n      in long articles day after day, of blasphemy because of the language of\n      the demons or of Shemus Rua, and because I made a woman sell her soul and\n      yet escape damnation, and of a lack of patriotism because I made Irish men\n      and women, who, it seems, never did such a thing, sell theirs. The\n      politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty Catholic students to sign\n      a protest against the play, and a Cardinal, who avowed that he had not\n      read it, to make another, and both politician and newspaper made such\n      obvious appeals to the audience to break the peace, that a score or so of\n      police were sent to the theatre to see that they did not. I had, however,\n      no reason to regret the result, for the stalls, containing almost all that\n      was distinguished in Dublin, and a gallery of artisans alike insisted on\n      the freedom of literature.",
                "After the performance in 1899 I added the love scene between Aleel and the\n      Countess, and in this new form the play was revived in New York by Miss\n      Wycherley as well as being played a good deal in England and America by\n      amateurs. Now at last I have made a complete revision to make it suitable\n      for performance at the Abbey Theatre. The first two scenes are almost\n      wholly new, and throughout the play I have added or left out such passages\n      as a stage experience of some years showed me encumbered the action; the\n      play in its first form having been written before I knew anything of the\n      theatre. I have left the old end, however, in the version printed in the\n      body of this book, because the change for dramatic purposes has been made\n      for no better reason than that audiences -- even at the Abbey Theatre -- are\n      almost ignorant of Irish mythology or because a shallow stage made the\n      elaborate vision of armed angels upon a mountain-side impossible. The new\n      end is particularly suited to the Abbey stage, where the stage platform\n      can be brought out in front of the prosceniurn and have a flight of steps\n      at one side up which the Angel comes, crossing towards the back of the\n      stage at the opposite side. The principal lighting is from two arc lights\n      in the balcony which throw their lights into the faces of the players,\n      making footlights unnecessary. The room at Shemus Rua's house is suggested\n      by a great grey curtain-a colour which becomes full of rich tints under\n      the stream of light from the arcs. The two or more arches in the third\n      scene permit the use of a gauze. The short front scene before the last is\n      just long enough when played with incidental music to allow the scene set\n      behind it to be changed. The play when played without interval in this way\n      lasts a little over an hour.",
                "The play was performed at the Abbey Theatre for the first time on December\n      14, 1911, Miss Maire O'Neill taking the part of the Countess, and the last\n      scene from the going out of the Merchants was as follows:-",
                "(MERCHANTS rush out. ALEEL crawls into the middle of the room; the\n      twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on.)",
                "ALEEL. They're rising up-they're rising through the earth, Fat Asmodel and\n      giddy Belial, And all the fiends. Now they leap in the air. But why does\n      Hell's gate creak so? Round and round, Hither and hither, to and fro\n      they're running.",
                "He moves about as though the air was full of spirits. OONA enters.)",
                "Crouch down, old heron, out of the blind storm.",
                "OONA. Where is the Countess Cathleen? All this day Her eyes were full of\n      tears, and when for a moment Her hand was laid upon my hand, it trembled.\n      And now I do not know where she is gone.",
                "ALEEL. Cathleen has chosen other friends than us, And they are rising\n      through the hollow world. Demons are out, old heron.",
                "OONA. God guard her soul.",
                "ALEEL. She's bartered it away this very hour, As though we two were never\n      in the world.",
                "(He kneels beside her, but does not seem to hear her words. The PEASANTS\n      return. They carry the COUNTESS CATHLEEN and lay her upon the ground\n      before OONA and ALEEL. She lies there as if dead.)",
                "OONA. O, that so many pitchers of rough clay Should prosper and the\n      porcelain break in two!",
                "(She kisses the hands Of CATHLEEN.)",
                "A PEASANT. We were under the tree where the path turns When she grew pale\n      as death and fainted away.",
                "CATHLEEN. O! hold me, and hold me tightly, for the storm is dragging me\n      away.",
                "(OONA takes her in her arms. A WOMAN begins to wail.)",
                "PEASANTS. Hush!",
                "PEASANTS Hush!",
                "PEASANT WOMEN. Hush!",
                "OTHER PEASANT WOMEN. Hush!",
                "CATHLEEN. (half rising) Lay all the bags of money in a heap, And when I am\n      gone, old Oona, share them out To every man and woman: judge, and give\n      According to their needs.",
                "A PEASANT WOMAN. And will she give Enough to keep my children through the\n      dearth?",
                "ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN. O, Queen of Heaven, and all you blessed saints, Let\n      us and ours be lost, so she be shriven.",
                "CATHLEEN. Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel; I gaze upon them as the\n      swallow gazes Upon the nest under the eave, before She wander the loud\n      waters. Do not weep Too great a while, for there is many a candle On the\n      High Altar though one fall. Aleel, Who sang about the dancers of the\n      woods, That know not the hard burden of the world, Having but breath in\n      their kind bodies, farewell And farewell, Oona, you who played with me And\n      bore me in your arms about the house When I was but a child-and therefore\n      happy, Therefore happy even like those that dance. The storm is in my hair\n      and I must go.",
                "(She dies.)",
                "OONA. Bring me the looking-glass.",
                "(A WOMAN brings it to her out of inner room. OONA holds glass over the\n      lips of CATHLEEN. All is Silent for a moment, then she speaks in a\n      half-scream.)",
                "O, she is dead!",
                "A PEASANT. She was the great white lily of the world.",
                "A PEASANT. She was more beautiful than the pale stars.",
                "AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN. The little plant I loved is broken in two.",
                "(ALEEL takes looking-glass from OONA and flings it upon floor, so that it\n      is broken in many pieces.)",
                "ALEEL. I shatter you in fragments, for the face That brimmed you up with\n      beauty is no more; And die, dull heart, for you that were a mirror Are but\n      a ball of passionate dust again! And level earth and plumy sea, rise up!\n      And haughty sky, fall down!",
                "A PEASANT WOMAN. Pull him upon his knees, His curses will pluck lightning\n      on our heads.",
                "ALEEL. Angels and devils clash in the middle air, And brazen swords clang\n      upon brazen helms. Look, look, a spear has gone through Belial's eye!",
                "(A winged ANGEL, carrying a torch and a sword, enters from the R. with\n      eyes fixed upon some distant thing. The ANGEL is about to pass out to the\n      L. when ALEEL speaks. The ANGEL Stops a moment and turns.)",
                "Look no more on the half-closed gates of Hell, But speak to me whose mind\n      is smitten of God, That it may be no more with mortal things: And tell of\n      her who lies there.",
                "(The ANGEL turns again and is about to go, but is seized by ALEEL.)",
                "Till you speak You shall not drift into eternity. ANGEL. The light beats\n      down; the gates of pearl are wide. And she is passing to the floor of\n      peace, And Mary of the seven times wounded heart Has kissed her lips, and\n      the long blessed hair Has fallen on her face; the Light of Lights Looks\n      always on the motive, not the deed, The Shadow of Shadows on the deed\n      alone.",
                "(ALEEL releases the ANGEL and kneels.)",
                "OONA. Tell them who walk upon the floor of peace.",
                "That I would die and go to her I love, The years like great black oxen\n      tread the world, And God the herdsman goads them on behind, And I am\n      broken by their passing feet."
