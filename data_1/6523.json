                "Madhav. What a state I am in! Before he came, nothing\nmattered; I felt so free. But now that he has come, goodness knows from where,\nmy heart is filled with his dear self, and my home will be no home to me when he\nleaves. Doctor, do you think he --",
                "Physician. If there's life in his fate, then he will live\nlong. But what the medical scriptures say, it seems --",
                "Madhav. Great heavens, what?",
                "Physician. The scriptures have it: \"Bile or palsey, cold or\ngout spring all alike.\"",
                "Madhav. Oh, get along, don't fling your scriptures at me; you\nonly make me more anxious; tell me what I can do.",
                "Physician [Taking snuff] The patient needs the most\nscrupulous care.",
                "Madhav. That's true; but tell me how.",
                "Physician. I have already mentioned, on no account must he be\nlet out of doors.",
                "Madhav Poor child, it is very hard to keep him indoors all day\nlong.",
                "Physician. What else can you do? The autumn sun and the damp\nare both very bad for the little fellow -- for the scriptures have it:",
                "\"In wheezing, swoon or in nervous fret,In jaundice or leaden\n  eyes -- \"",
                "Madhav. Never mind the scriptures, please. Eh, then we must\nshut the poor thing up. Is there no other method?",
                "Physician. None at all: for, \"In the wind and in the sun -- \"",
                "Madhav. What will your \"in this and in that\" do for me now?\nWhy don't you let them alone and come straight to the point? What's to be done\nthen? Your system is very, very hard for the poor boy; and he is so quiet too\nwith all his pain and sickness. It tears my heart to see him\nwince, as he takes your medicine.",
                "Physician. effect. That's why the sage Chyabana observes: \"In\nmedicine as in good advices, the least palatable ones are the truest.\" Ah, well!\nI must be trotting now. [Exit]",
                "[Gaffer enters]",
                "Madhav. Well, I'm jiggered, there's Gaffer now.",
                "Gaffer. Why, why, I won't bite you.",
                "Madhav. No, but you are a devil to send children off their\nheads.",
                "Gaffer. But you aren't a child, and you've no child in the\nhouse; why worry then?",
                "Madhav. Oh, but I have brought a child into the house.",
                "Gaffer. Indeed, how so?",
                "Madhav. You remember how my wife was dying to adopt a child?",
                "Gaffer. Yes, but that's an old story; you didn't like the\nidea.",
                "Madhav. You know, brother, how hard all this getting money in\nhas been. That somebody else's child would sail in and waste all\nthis money earned with so much trouble -- Oh, I hated the idea. But this boy\nclings to my heart in such a queer sort of way --",
                "Gaffer. So that's the trouble! and your money goes all for him\nand feels jolly lucky it does go at all.",
                "Madhav. Formerly, earning was a sort of passion with me; I\nsimply couldn't help working for money. Now, I make money and as I know it is\nall for this dear boy, earning becomes a joy to me.",
                "Gaffer. Ah, well, and where did you pick him up?",
                "Madhav. He is the son of a man who was a brother to my wife by\nvillage ties. He has had no mother since infancy; and now the\nother day he lost his father as well.",
                "Gaffer. Poor thing: and so he needs me all the more.",
                "Madhav. The doctor says all the organs of his little body are\nat loggerheads with each other, and there isn't much hope for his life. There is\nonly one way to save him and that is to keep him out of this autumn wind and\nsun. But you are such a terror! What with this game of yours at your age, too,\nto get children out of doors!",
                "Gaffer. God bless my soul! So I'm already as bad as autumn\nwind and sun, eh! But, friend, I know something, too, of the game of keeping\nthem indoors. When my day's work is over I am coming in to make\nfriends with this child of yours. [Exit]",

                "Amal. Uncle, I say, Uncle!",
                "Madhav. Hullo! Is that you, Amal?",
                "Amal. Mayn't I be out of the courtyard at all?",
                "Madhav. No, my dear, no.",
                "Amal. See, there where Auntie grinds lentils in the quirn, the\nsquirrel is sitting with his tail up and with his wee hands he's picking up the\nbroken grains of lentils and crunching them. Can't I run up\nthere?",
                "Madhav. No, my darling, no.",
                "Amal. Wish I were a squirrel! -- it would be lovely. Uncle, why\nwon't you let me go about?",
                "Madhav. Doctor says it's bad for you to be out.",
                "Amal. How can the doctor know?",
                "Madhav. What a thing to say! The doctor can't know and he\nreads such huge books!",
                "Amal. Does his book-learning tell him everything?",
                "Madhav. Of course, don't you know!",
                "Amal [With a sigh] Ah, I am so stupid! I don't read\nbooks.",
                "Madhav. Now, think of it; very, very learned people are all\nlike you; they are never out of doors.",
                "Amal. Aren't they really?",
                "Madhav. No, how can they? Early and late they toil and moil at\ntheir books, and they've eyes for nothing else. Now, my little man, you are\ngoing to be learned when you grow up; and then you will stay at\nhome and read such big books, and people will notice you and say, \"he's a\nwonder.\"",
                "Amal. No, no, Uncle; I beg of you by your dear feet -- I don't\nwant to be learned, I won't.",
                "Madhav. Dear, dear; it would have been my saving if I could\nhave been learned.",
                "Amal. No, I would rather go about and see everything that\nthere is.",
                "Madhav. Listen to that! See! What will you see, what is there\nso much to see?",
                "Amal. See that far-away hill from our window -- I often long to\ngo beyond those hills and right away.",
                "Madhav. Oh, you silly! As if there's nothing more to be done\nbut just get up to the top of that hill and away! Eh! You don't talk sense, my\nboy. Now listen, since that hill stands there upright as a barrier, it means you\ncan't get beyond it. Else, what was the use in heaping up so many large stones\nto make such a big affair of it, eh!",
                "Amal. Uncle, do you think it is meant to prevent your crossing\nover? It seems to me because the earth can't speak it raises its hands into the\nsky and beckons. And those who live far and sit alone by their windows can see\nthe signal. But I suppose the learned people --",
                "Madhav. No, they don't have time for that sort of nonsense.\nThey are not crazy like you.",
                "Amal. Do you know, yesterday I met someone quite as crazy as I\nam.",
                "Madhav. Gracious me, really, how so?",
                "Amal. He had a bamboo staff on his shoulder with a small\nbundle at the top, and a brass pot in his left hand, and an old pair of shoes\non; he was making for those hills straight across that meadow there. I called\nout to him and asked, \"Where are you going?\" He answered, \"I\ndon't know, anywhere!\" I asked again, \"Why are you going?\" He said, \"I'm going\nout to seek work.\" Say, Uncle, have you to seek work?",
                "Madhav. Of course I have to. There's many about looking for\njobs.",
                "Amal. How lovely! I'll go about, like them too, finding things\nto do.",
                "Madhav. Suppose you seek and don't find. Then --",
                "Amal. Wouldn't that be jolly? Then I should go farther! I\nwatched that man slowly walking on with his pair of worn out shoes. And when he\ngot to where the water flows under the fig tree, he stopped and\nwashed his feet in the stream. Then he took out from his bundle some gram-flour,\nmoistened it with water and began to eat. Then he tied up his bundle and\nshouldered it again; tucked up his cloth above his knees and crossed the stream.\nI've asked Auntie to let me go up to the stream, and eat my gram-flour just like\nhim.",
                "Madhav. And what did your Auntie say to that?",
                "Amal. Auntie said, \"Get well and then I'll take you over\nthere.\" Please, Uncle, when shall I get well?",
                "Madhav. It won't be long, dear.",
                "Amal. Really, but then I shall go right away the moment I'm\nwell again.",
                "Madhav. And where will you go?",
                "Amal. Oh, I will walk on, crossing so many streams, wading\nthrough water. Everybody will be asleep with their doors shut in the heat of the\nday and I will tramp on and on seeking work far, very far.",
                "Madhav. I see! I think you had better be getting well first;\nthen --",
                "Amal. But then you won't want me to be learned, will you,\nUncle?",
                "Madhav. What would you rather be then?",
                "Amal. I can't think of anything just now; but I'll tell you\nlater on.",
                "Madhav. Very well. But mind you, you aren't to call out and\ntalk to strangers again.",
                "Amal. But I love to talk to strangers!",
                "Madhav. Suppose they had kidnapped you?",
                "Amal. That would have been splendid! But no one ever takes me\naway. They all want me to stay in here.",
                "Madhav. I am off to my work -- but, darling, you won't go out,\nwill you?",
                "Amal. No, I won't. But, Uncle, you'll let me be in this room\nby the roadside.",
                "[Exit Madhav]",
                "Dairyman. Curds, curds, good nice curds.",
                "Amal. Curdseller, I say, Curdseller.",
                "Dairyman. Why do you call me? Will you buy some curds?",
                "Amal. How can I buy? I have no money.",
                "Dairyman. What a boy! Why call out then? Ugh! What a waste of\ntime.",
                "Amal. I would go with you if I could.",
                "Dairyman. With me?",
                "Amal. Yes, I seem to feel homesick when I hear you call from\nfar down the road.",
                "Dairyman [Lowering his yoke-pole] Whatever are you\ndoing here, my child?",
                "Amal. The doctor says I'm not to be out, so I sit here all day\nlong.",
                "Dairyman. My poor child, whatever has happened to you?",
                "Amal. I can't tell. You see I am not learned, so I don't know\nwhat's the matter with me. Say, Dairyman, where do you come from?",
                "Dairyman. From our village.",
                "Amal. Your village? Is it very far?",
                "Dairyman. Our village lies on the river Shamli at the foot of\nthe Panch-mura hills.",
                "Amal. Panch-mura hills! Shamli river! I wonder. I may have\nseen your village. I can't think when though!",
                "Dairyman. Have you seen it? Been to the foot of those hills?",
                "Amal. Never. But I seem to remember having seen it. Your\nvillage is under some very old big trees, just by the side of the red\nroad -- isn't that so?",
                "Dairyman. That's right, child.",
                "Amal. And on the slope of the hill cattle grazing.",
                "Dairyman. How wonderful! Aren't there cattle grazing in our\nvillage! Indeed, there are!",
                "Amal. And your women with red sarees fill their pitchers from\nthe river and carry them on their heads.",
                "Dairyman. Good, that's right. Women from our dairy village do\ncome and draw their water from the river; but then it isn't everyone who has a\nred saree to put on. But, my dear child, surely you must have been there for a\nwalk some time.",
                "Amal. Really, Dairyman, never been there at all. But the first\nday doctor lets me go out, you are going to take me to your village.",
                "Dairyman. I will, my child, with pleasure.",
                "Amal. And you'll teach me to cry curds and shoulder the yoke\nlike you and walk the long, long road?",
                "Dairyman. Dear, dear, did you ever? Why should you sell curds?\nNo, you will read big books and be learned.",
                "Amal. No, I never want to be learned -- I'll be like you and\ntake my curds from the village by the red road near the old banyan tree, and I\nwill hawk it from cottage to cottage. Oh, how do you cry -- \"Curd, curd, good nice\ncurd!\" Teach me the tune, will you?",
                "Dairyman. Dear, dear, teach you the tune; what an idea!",
                "Amal. Please do. I love to hear it. I can't tell you how queer\nI feel when I hear you cry out from the bend of that road, through the line of\nthose trees! Do you know I feel like that when I hear the shrill cry of kites\nfrom almost the end of the sky?",
                "Dairyman. Dear child, will you have some curds? Yes, do.",
                "Amal. But I have no money.",
                "Dairyman. No, no, no, don't talk of money! You'll make me so\nhappy if you have a little curds from me.",
                "Amal. Say, have I kept you too long?",
                "Dairyman. Not a bit; it has been no loss to me at all; you\nhave taught me how to be happy selling curds. [Exit]",
                "Amal [Intoning] Curds, curds, good nice curds -- from the\ndairy village -- from the country of the Panch-mura hills by the Shamli bank.\nCurds, good curds; in the early morning the women make the cows stand in a row\nunder the trees and milk them, and in the evening they turn the milk into curds.\nCurds, good curds. Hello, there's the watchman on his rounds. Watchman, I say,\ncome and have a word with me.",
                "Watchman. What's all this row you are making? Aren't you\nafraid of the likes of me?",
                "Amal. No, why should I be?",
                "Watchman. Suppose I march you off then?",
                "Amal. Where will you take me to? Is it very far, right beyond\nthe hills?",
                "Watchman. Suppose I march you straight to the King?",
                "Amal. To the King! Do, will you? But the doctor won't let me\ngo out. No one can ever take me away. I've got to stay here all day long.",
                "Watchman. Doctor won't let you, poor fellow! So I see! Your\nface is pale and there are dark rings round your eyes. Your veins stick out from\nyour poor thin hands.",
                "Amal. Won't you sound the gong, Watchman?",
                "Watchman. Time has not yet come.",
                "Amal. How curious! Some say time has not yet come, and some\nsay time has gone by! But surely your time will come the moment you strike the\ngong!",
                "Watchman. That's not possible; I strike up the gong only when\nit is time.",
                "Amal. Yes, I love to hear your gong. When it is midday and our\nmeal is over, Uncle goes off to his work and Auntie falls asleep reading her\nR\u00e2mayana, and in the courtyard under the shadow of the wall our\ndoggie sleeps with his nose in his curled up tail; then your gong strikes out,\n\"Dong, dong, dong!\" Tell me why does your gong sound?",
                "Watchman. My gong sounds to tell the people, Time waits for\nnone, but goes on forever.",
                "Amal. Where, to what land?",
                "Watchman. That none knows.",
                "Amal. Then I suppose no one has ever been there! Oh, I do wish\nto fly with the time to that land of which no one knows anything.",
                "Watchman. All of us have to get there one day, my child.",

                "Watchman. One day the doctor himself may take you there by the\nhand.",
                "Amal. He won't; you don't know him. He only keeps me in.",
                "Watchman. One greater than he comes and lets us free.",
                "Amal. When will this great doctor come for me? I can't stick\nin here any more.",
                "Watchman. Shouldn't talk like that, my child.",
                "Amal. No. I am here where they have left me -- I never move a\nbit. But when your gong goes off, dong, dong, dong, it goes to my heart. Say,\nWatchman?",
                "Watchman. Yes, my dear.",
                "Amal. Say, what's going on there in that big house on the\nother side, where there is a flag flying high up and the people\nare always going in and out?",
                "Watchman. Oh, there? That's our new Post Office.",
                "Amal. Post Office? Whose?",
                "Watchman. Whose? Why, the King's surely!",

                "Watchman. Otherwise why should he set his Post Office here\nright in front of your open window, with the golden flag flying?",
                "Amal. But who will fetch me my King's letter when it comes?",
                "Watchman. The King has many postmen. Don't you see them run\nabout with round gilt badges on their chests?",
                "Amal. Well, where do they go?",
                "Watchman. Oh, from door to door, all through the country.",
                "Amal. I'll be the King's postman when I grow up.",
                "Watchman. Ha! ha! Postman, indeed! Rain or shine, rich or\npoor, from house to house delivering letters -- that's very great work!",
                "Amal. That's what I'd like best. What makes you smile so? Oh,\nyes, your work is great too. When it is silent everywhere in the heat of the\nnoonday, your gong sounds, Dong, dong, dong, --  and sometimes when I wake up at\nnight all of a sudden and find our lamp blown out, I can hear\nthrough the darkness your gong slowly sounding, Dong, dong, dong!",

                "Amal. I suppose the King's made him our headman here?",
                "Watchman. Made him? Oh, no! A fussy busy-body! He knows so\nmany ways of making himself unpleasant that everybody is afraid of him. It's\njust a game for the likes of him, making trouble for everybody. I must be off\nnow! Mustn't keep work waiting, you know! I'll drop in again to-morrow morning\nand tell you all the news of the town. [Exit]",
                "Amal. It would be splendid to have a letter from the King\nevery day. I'll read them at the window. But, oh! I can't read writing. Who'll\nread them out to me, I wonder! Auntie reads her R\u00e2mayana; she may know the\nKing's writing. If no one will, then I must keep them carefully and read them\nwhen I'm grown up. But if the postman can't find me? Headman, Mr. Headman, may I\nhave a word with you?",

                "Madhav [With folded palms] I beseech you, headman,\ndon't you joke about these things --",
                "Gaffer. Cutting jokes indeed, dare he!",
                "Madhav. Are you out of your mind too, Gaffer?",
                "Gaffer. Out of my mind, well then I am; I can read plainly\nthat the King writes he will come himself to see Amal, with the state physician.",
                "Amal. Fakir, Fakir, 'sh, his trumpet! Can't you hear?",
                "Headman. Ha! ha! ha! I fear he won't until he's a bit more off\nhis head.",
                "Amal. Mr. Headman, I thought you were cross with me and didn't\nlove me. I never could think you would fetch me the King's letter. Let me wipe\nthe dust off your feet.",
                "Headman. This little child does have an instinct of reverence.\nThough a little silly, he has a good heart.",
                "Amal. It's hard on the fourth watch now, I suppose -- Hark the\ngong, \"Dong, dong, ding,\" \"Dong, dong, ding.\" Is the evening\nstar up? How is it I can't see --",
                "Gaffer. Oh, the windows are all shut, I'll open them.",
                "[A knocking outside]",
                "Madhav. What's that? -- Who is it -- what a bother!",
                "Voice [From outside] Open the door.",
                "Madhav Say, Headman -- Hope they're not robbers.",
                "Headman Who's there? -- It's Panchanan, the headman,\ncalls -- Aren't you afraid of the like of me? Fancy! The noise has\nceased! Panchanan's voice carries far. -- Yes, show me the biggest robbers!",
                "Madhav [Peering out of the window] I should think the\nnoise has ceased. They've smashed the door.",
                "[The King's Herald enters]",
                "Herald. Our Sovereign King comes to-night!",
                "Headman. My God!",
                "Amal. At what hour of the night, Herald?",
                "Herald. On the second watch.",
                "Amal. When from the city gates my friend the watchman will\nstrike his gong, \"ding dong ding, ding dong ding\" -- then?",
                "Herald. Yes, then. The King sends his greatest physician to\nattend on his young friend.",
                "[State Physician enters]",
                "State Physician. What's this? How close it is here! Open wide\nall the doors and windows. [Feeling Amal's body] How do you feel, my\nchild?",
                "Amal. I feel very well, Doctor, very well. All pain is gone.\nHow fresh and open! I can see all the stars now twinkling from the other side of\nthe dark.",
                "Physician. Will you feel well enough to leave your bed with\nthe King when he comes in the middle watches of the night?",
                "Amal. Of course, I'm dying to be about for ever so long. I'll\nask the King to find me the polar star. -- I must have seen it often, but I don't\nknow exactly which it is.",
                "Physician. He will tell you everything. [To Madhav]\nWill you go about and arrange flowers through the room for the King's visit?\n[Indicating the Headman] We can't have that person in here.",
                "Amal. No, let him be, Doctor. He is a friend. It was he who\nbrought me the King's letter.",
                "Physician. Very well, my child. He may remain if he is a\nfriend of yours.",
                "Madhav [Whispering into Amal's ear] My child, the King\nloves you. He is coming himself. Beg for a gift from him. You know our humble\ncircumstances.",
                "Amal. Don't you worry, Uncle. -- I've made up my mind about it.",
                "Madhav. What is it, my child?",
                "Amal. I shall ask him to make me one of his postmen that I may\nwander far and wide, delivering his message from door to door.",
                "Madhav [Slapping his forehead] Alas, is that all?",
                "Amal. What'll be our offerings to the King, Uncle, when he\ncomes?",
                "Herald. He has commanded puffed rice.",
                "Amal. Puffed rice! Say, Headman, you're right. You said so.\nYou knew all we didn't.",
                "Headman. If you send word to my house then I could manage for\nthe King's advent really nice --",
                "Physician. No need at all. Now be quiet all of you. Sleep is\ncoming over him. I'll sit by his pillow; he's dropping into\nslumber. Blow out the oil-lamp. Only let the star-light stream in. Hush, he\nslumbers.",
                "Madhav [Addressing Gaffer] What are you standing there\nfor like a statue, folding your palms. -- I am nervous. -- Say, are they good omens?\nWhy are they darkening the room? How will star-light help?",
                "Gaffer. Silence, unbeliever.",
                "[Sudha enters]",
                "Sudha. Amal!",
                "Physician. He's asleep.",
                "Sudha. I have some flowers for him. Mayn't I give them into\nhis own hand?",
                "Physician. Yes, you may.",
                "Sudha. When will he be awake?",
                "Physician. Directly the King comes and calls him.",
                "Sudha. Will you whisper a word for me in his ear?",
                "Physician. What shall I say?",
                "Sudha. Tell him Sudha has not forgotten him.",
