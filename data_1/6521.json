                "FIRST MAN.\nHo, Sir!",
                "CITY GUARD.\nWhat do you want?",
                "SECOND MAN.\nWhich way should we go? We are strangers here. Please tell us which street we\nshould take.",
                "CITY GUARD.\nWhere do you want to go?",
                "THIRD MAN.\nTo where those big festivities are going to be held, you know. Which way do we\ngo?",
                "CITY GUARD.\nOne street is quite as good as another here. Any street will lead you there. Go\nstraight ahead, and you cannot miss the place. [Exit.]",
                "FIRST MAN.\nJust hear what the fool says: \"Any street will lead you there!\"\nWhere, then, would be the sense of having so many streets?",
                "SECOND MAN.\nYou needn't be so awfully put out at that, my man. A country is free to\narrange its affairs in its own way. As for roads in our country -- well,\nthey are as good as non-existent; narrow and crooked lanes, a labyrinth of ruts\nand tracks. Our King does not believe in open thoroughfares; he thinks that\nstreets are just so many openings for his subjects to fly away from his\nkingdom. It is quite the contrary here; nobody stands in your way, nobody\nobjects to your going elsewhere if you like to; and yet the people are far from\ndeserting this kingdom. With such streets our country would certainly have been\ndepopulated in no time.",
                "FIRST MAN.\nMy dear Janardan, I have always noticed that this is a great fault in your\ncharacter.",
                "JANARDAN.\nWhat is?",
                "FIRST MAN.\nThat you are always having a fling at your country. How can you think that open\nhighways may be good for a country? Look here, Kaundilya; here is a man who\nactually believes that open highways are the salvation of a country.",
                "KAUNDILYA.\nThere is no need, Bhavadatta, of my pointing out afresh that Janardan is\nblessed with an intelligence which is remarkably crooked, which is sure to land\nhim in danger some day. If the King comes to hear of our worthy friend, he will\nmake it a pretty hard job for him to find any one to do him his funeral rites\nwhen he is dead.",
                "BHAVADATTA.\nOne can't help feeling that life becomes a burden in this country; one\nmisses the joys of privacy in these streets -- this jostling and brushing\nshoulders with strange people day and night makes one long for a bath. And\nnobody can tell exactly what kind of people you are meeting with in these\npublic roads -- ugh!",
                "KAUNDILYA.\nAnd it is Janardan who persuaded us to come to this precious country! We never\nhad any second person like him in our family. You knew my father, of course; he\nwas a great man, a pious man if ever there was one. He spent his whole life\nwithin a circle of a radius of 49 cubits drawn with a rigid adherence to the\ninjunctions of the scriptures, and never for a single day did he cross this\ncircle. After his death a serious difficulty arose -- how cremate him within\nthe limits of the 49 cubits and yet outside the house? At length the priests\ndecided that though we could not go beyond the scriptural number, the only way\nout of the difficulty was to reverse the figure and make it 94 cubits; only\nthus could we cremate him outside the house without violating the sacred books.\nMy word, that was strict observance! Ours is indeed no common country.",
                "BHAVADATTA.\nAnd yet, though Janardan comes from the very same soil, he thinks it wise to\ndeclare that open highways are best for a country.",

Of course, that matter of your\nbrother's finding a hidden fortune while digging for a well -- well,\nyou know well enough why I had to give it out. You know all the facts.",
                "SECOND CITIZEN.\nOf course I know. And it is because I know that I ask, could you keep a secret\nif I tell you? It may mean ruination to us all, you know, if you once let it\nout.",

                "VIRUPAKSHA.\nIt is only because the topic came up -- well, then, I shall not say\nanything. I am not the man to say things for nothing. You had yourself brought\nup the question that the King never showed himself; and I only remarked that it\nwas not for nothing that the King shut himself up from the public gaze.",

                "VIRUPAKSHA.\nOf course I don't mind telling you -- for we are all good friends,\naren't we? There can be no harm. (With a low voice.) The\nKing -- is -- hideous to look at, so he has made up his mind never to\nshow himself to his subjects.",
                "FIRST CITIZEN.\nHa! that's it! It must be so. We have always wondered . . . why, the mere\nsight of a King in all countries makes one's soul quake like an aspen\nleaf with fear; but why should our King never have been seen by any mortal\nsoul? Even if he at least came out and consigned us all to the gibbet, we might\nbe sure that our King was no hoax. After all, there is much in\nVirupaksha's explanation that sounds plausible enough.",
                "THIRD CITIZEN.\nNot a bit -- I don't believe in a syllable of it.",
                "VIRUPAKSHA.\nWhat, Vishu, do you mean to say that I am a liar?",
                "VISHU.\nI don't exactly mean that -- but I cannot accept your theory. Excuse\nme, I cannot help if I seem a bit rude or churlish.",
                "VIRUPAKSHA.\nSmall wonder that you can't believe my words -- you who think yourself\nsage enough to reject the opinions of your parents and superiors. How long do\nyou think you could have stayed in this country if the King did not remain in\nhiding? You are no better than a flagrant heretic.",
                "VISHU.\nMy dear pillar of orthodoxy! Do you think any other King would have hesitated\nto cut off your tongue and make it food for dogs? And you have the face to say\nthat our King is horrid to look at!",
                "VIRUPAKSHA.\nLook here, Vishu. will you curb your tongue?",
                "VISHU.\nIt would be superfluous to point out whose tongue needs the curbing.",
                "FIRST CITIZEN.\nHush, my dear friends -- this looks rather bad. . . . It seems as if they\nare resolved to put me in danger as well. I am not going to be a party to all\nthis.[Exit.]",

                "[A Road. SUDARSHANA and SURANGAMA]",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nWhat a relief, Surangama, what freedom! It is my defeat that has brought me\nfreedom. Oh, what an iron pride was mine! Nothing could move it or soften it.\nMy darkened mind could not in any way be brought to see the plain truth that it\nwas not the King who was to come, it was I who ought to have gone to him. All\nthrough yesternight I lay alone on the dusty floor before that window -- lay\nthere through the desolate hours and wept! All night the southern winds blew\nand shrieked and moaned like the pain that was biting at my heart; and all\nthrough it I heard the plaintive \"Speak, wife!\" of the nightbird\nechoing in the tumult outside! . . . It was the helpless wail of the dark\nnight, Surangama!",
                "SURANGAMA.\nLast night's heavy and melancholy air seemed to hang on for an\neternity -- oh, what a dismal and gboomy night!",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nBut would you believe it -- I seemed to hear the soft strains of the\nvina floating through all that wild din and tumult! Could he play such\nsweet and tender tunes, he who is so cruel and terrible? The world knows only\nmy indignity and ignominy -- but none but my own heart could hear those\nstrains that called me through the lone and wailing night. Did you too,\nSurangama, hear the vina? Or was that but a dream of mine?",
                "SURANGAMA.\nBut it is just to hear that same vina's music that I am always by\nyour side. It is for this call of music, which I knew would one day come to\ndissolve all the barriers of love, that I have all along been listening with an\ncager ear.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nHe did at last send me on the open road -- I could not withstand his will.\nWhen I shall find him, the first words that I shall tell him will be, \"I\nhave come of my own will -- I have not awaited your coming.\" I shall\nsay, \"For your sake have I trodden the hard and weary roads, and bitter\nand ceaseless has been my weeping all the way.\" I shall at least have\nthis pride in me when I meet him.",
                "SURANGAMA.\nBut even that pride will not last. He came before you did -- who else could\nhave sent you on the road?",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nPerhaps he did. As long as a sense of offended pride remained with me, I could\nnot help thinking that he had left me for good; but when I flung my dignity and\npride to the winds and came out on the common streets, then it seemed to me\nthat he too had come out: I have been finding him since the moment I was on the\nroad. I have no misgivings now. All this suffering that I have gone through for\nhis sake, the very bitternesss of all this is giving me his company. Ah! yes,\nhe has come -- he has held me by the hand, just as he used to do in that\nchamber of darkness, when, at his touch, all my body would start with a sudden\nthrill: it is the same, the same touch again! Who says that he is not\nhere? -- Surangama, can you not see that he has come, in silence and secret?\n. . . Who is that there? Look, Surangama, there is a third traveller of this\ndark road at this hour of the night.",
                "SURANGAMA.\nI see, it is the King of Kanchi, my Queen.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nKing of Kanchi!",
                "SURANGAMA.\nDon't be afraid, my Queen!",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nAfraid! Why should I be afraid? The days of fear are gone for ever for me.",
                "KANCHI.\n[entering] Queen-mother, I see you two on this road! I am a traveller of\nthe same path as yourself. Have no fear of me, O Queen!",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nIt is well, King of Kanchi, that we should be going together, side by\nside -- this is but right. I came on your way when I first left my home, and\nnow I meet you again on my way back. Who could have dreamed that this meeting\nof ours would augur so well?",
                "KANCHI.\nBut, Queen-mother, it is not meet that you should walk over this road on foot.\nWill you permit me to get a chariot for you?",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nOh, do not say so: I shall never be happy if I could not on my way back home\ntread on the dust of the road that led me away from my King. I would be\ndeceiving myself if I were now to go in a chariot.",
                "SURANGAMA.\nKing, you too are walking in the dust to-day: this road has never known anybody\ndriving his horse or chariot over it.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nWhen I was the Queen, I stepped over silver and gold -- I shall have now to\natone for the evil fortune of my birth by walking over dust and bare earth. I\ncould not have dreamed that thus I would meet my King of common earth and dust\nat every step of mine to-day.",
                "SURANGAMA.\nLook, my Queen, there on the eastern horizon comes the dawn. We have not long\nto walk: I see the spires of the golden turrets of the King's palace.",
                "[Enter GRANDFATHER]",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nMy child, it is dawn -- at last!",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nYour benedictions have given me Godspeed, and here I am, at last.",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nBut do you see how ill-mannered our King is? He has sent no chariot, no music\nband, nothing splendid or grand.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nNothing grand, did you say? Look, the sky is rosy and crimson from end to end,\nthe air is full of the welcome of the scent of flowers.",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nYes, but however cruel our King may be, we cannot seek to emulate him: I cannot\nhelp feeling pain at seeing you in this state, my child. How can we bear to see\nyou going to the King's palace attired in this poor and wretched attire?\nWait a little -- I am running to fetch you your Queen's garments.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nOh no, no, no! He has taken away those regal robes from me for ever -- he\nhas attired me in a servant's dress before the eyes of the whole world:\nwhat a relief this has been to me! I am his servant now, no longer his Queen.\nTo-day I stand at the feet of all those who can claim any relationship with\nhim.",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nBut your enemies will laugh at you now: how can you bear their derision?",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nLet their laughter and derision be immortal -- let them throw dust at me in\nthe streets: this dust will to-day be the powder with which I shall deck myself\nbefore meeting my lord.",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nAfter this, we shall say nothing. Now let us play the last game of our Spring\nFestival -- instead of the pollen of flowers let the south breeze blow and\nscatter dust of lowliness in every direction! We shall go to the lord clad in\nthe common grey of the dust. And we shall find him too covered with dust all\nover. For do you think the people spare him? Even he cannot escape from their\nsoiled and dusty hands, and he does not even care to brush the dirt off his\ngarments.",
                "KANCHI.\nGrandfather, do not forget me in this game of yours! I also will have to get\nthis royal garment of mine soiled till it is beyond all recognition.",
                "GRANDFATHER.\nThat will not take long, my brother. Now that you have come down so\nfar -- you will change your colour in no time. Just look at our\nQueen -- she got into a temper with herself and thought that she could spoil\nher matchless beauty by flinging away all her ornaments: but this insult to her\nbeauty has made it shine forth in tenfold radiance, and now it is in its\nunadorned perfection. We hear that our King is all innocent of\nbeauty -- that is why he loves all his manifold beauty of form which shines\nas the very ornament of his breast. And that beauty has to-day taken off its\nveil and cloak of pride and vanity! What could I not give to be allowed to hear\nthe wonderful music and song that has filled my King's palace to-day!",
                "SURANGAMA.\nLo, there rises the sun!"

                "KING.\nWill you be able to bear me now?",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nOh yes, yes, I shall. Your sigh repelled me because I had sought to find you in\nthe pleasure garden, in my Queen's chambers: there even your meanest\nservant looks handsomer than you. That fever of longing has left my eyes for\never. You are not beautiful, my lord -- you stand beyond all comparisons!",
                "KING.\nThat which can be comparable with me lies within yourself.",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nIf this be so, then that too is beyond comparison. Your love lives in\nme -- you are mirrored in that love, and you see your face reflected in me:\nnothing of this mine, it is all yours, O lord!",
                "KING.\nI open the doors of this dark room to-day -- the game is finished here!\nCome, come with me now, come outside -- into the light!",
                "SUDARSHANA.\nBefore I go, let me bow at the feet of my lord of darkness, my cruel, my\nterrible, my peerless one!",
