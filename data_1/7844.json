                "INTRODUCTION",
                "The three plays here presented were the outcome of a period when\n      Bj\u00f6rnson's views on many topics were undergoing a drastic revision and he\n      was abandoning much of his previous orthodoxy in many directions. Two of\n      them were written during, and one immediately after, a three years'\n      absence from Norway -- years spent almost entirely in southern Europe.\n      [Note: Further details respecting Bj\u00f6rnson's life will be found in the\n      Introduction to Three Comedies by Bj\u00f6rnson, published in Everyman's\n      Library in 1912.] For nearly ten years previous to this voluntary exile,\n      Bj\u00f6rnson had been immersed in theatrical management and political\n      propagandism. His political activities (guided by a more or less\n      pronounced republican tendency) centred in an agitation for a truer\n      equality between the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, his point of view\n      being that Norway had come to be regarded too much as a mere appanage of\n      Sweden. Between that and his manifold and distracting cares as theatrical\n      director, he had let imaginative work slide for the time being; but his\n      years abroad had a recuperative effect, and, in addition, broadened his\n      mental outlook in a remarkable manner. Foreign travel, a wider\n      acquaintance with differing types of humanity, and, above all, a newly-won\n      acquaintance with the contemporary literature of other countries, made a\n      deep impression upon Bj\u00f6rnson's vigorously receptive mind. He browsed\n      voraciously upon the works of foreign writers. Herbert Spencer, Darwin,\n      John Stuart Mill, Taine, Max-M\u00fcller, formed a portion of his mental\n      pabulum at this time -- and the result was a significant alteration of\n      mental attitude on a number of questions, and a determination to make the\n      attempt to embody his theories in dramatic form. He had gained all at\n      once, as he wrote to Georg Brandes, the eminent Danish critic, \"eyes that\n      saw and ears that heard.\" Up to this time the poet in him had been\n      predominant; now it was to be the social philosopher that held the reins.\n      Just as Ibsen did, so Bj\u00f6rnson abandoned historical drama and artificial\n      comedy for an attempt at prose drama which should have at all events a\n      serious thesis. In this he anticipated Ibsen; for (unless we include the\n      satirical political comedy, The League of Youth, which was\n      published in 1869, among Ibsen's \"social dramas\") Ibsen did not enter the\n      field with Pillars of Society [Note: Published in The Pretenders\n      and Two Other Plays, in Everyman's Library, 1913.] until 1877, whereas\n      Bj\u00f6rnson's The Editor, The Bankrupt, and The King\n      were all published between 1874 and 1877. Intellectual and literary life\n      in Denmark had been a good deal stirred and quickened in the early\n      seventies, and the influence of that awakening was inevitably felt by the\n      more eager spirits in the other Scandinavian countries. It is amusing to\n      note, as one Norwegian writer has pointed out, that this intellectual\n      upheaval (which, in its turn, was a reflection of that taking place in\n      outer Europe) came at a time when the bulk of the Scandinavian folk \"were\n      congratulating themselves that the doubt and ferment of unrest which were\n      undermining the foundations of the great communities abroad had not had\n      the power to ruffle the placid surface of our good, old-fashioned,\n      Scandinavian orthodoxy.\" Bj\u00f6rnson makes several sly hits in these plays\n      (as does Ibsen in Pillars of Society) at this distrust of the\n      opinions and manners of the larger communities outside of Scandinavia,\n      notably America, with which the Scandinavian countries were more\n      particularly in touch through emigration.",
                "Brandes characterises the impelling motive of these three plays as a\n      passionate appeal for a higher standard of truth -- in journalism, in\n      finance, in monarchy: an appeal for less casuistry and more honesty. Such\n      a motive was characteristic of the vehement honesty of Bj\u00f6rnson's own\n      character; he must always, as he says in one of his letters, go over to\n      the side of any one whom he believed to \"hold the truth in his hands.\"",
                "The Editor (Redakt\u00f6ren) was written while Bj\u00f6rnson was in\n      Florence, and was published at Copenhagen in 1874. It was at first not\n      accepted for performance at Christiania or Copenhagen, though an\n      unauthorised performance of it was given at one of the lesser Christiania\n      theatres in 1875, Meanwhile a Swedish version of it had been produced,\n      authoritatively, at Stockholm in February of that year. The play\n      eventually made its way on the Norwegian and Danish stage; but, before\n      that, it had been seen in German dress at Munich and Hamburg. As an\n      inevitable result of his recent activities as a political speaker and\n      pamphleteer, Bj\u00f6rnson had come in for a good deal of vituperation in the\n      press, a fact which no doubt added some gall to the ink with which he drew\n      the portrait of the journalist in this play. The Stockholm critics,\n      indeed, had condemned The Editor as merely a pamphleteering attack\n      on the editor of a well-known journal. In answer to this criticism\n      Bj\u00f6rnson wrote from Rome in March, 1875: \"It is said that my play is a\n      pamphleteering attack on a certain individual. That is a deliberate lie. I\n      have studied the journalist type, which is here represented, in many other\n      countries besides my own. The chief characteristic of this type is to be\n      actuated by an inordinate egotism that is perpetually being inflamed by\n      passion; that makes use of bogeys to frighten people, and does this in\n      such a way that, while it makes all its honest contemporaries afraid of\n      any freedom of thought, it also produces the same result on every single\n      individual by means of reckless persecution. As I wished to portray that\n      type, I naturally took a good deal of the portrait from the representative\n      of the type that I knew best; but, like every artist who wishes to produce\n      a complete creation, I had to build it up from separate revelations of\n      itself. There can, therefore, be no question of any individual being\n      represented in my play except in so far as he may partially agree with the\n      type.\"",
                "However much Bj\u00f6rnson may have written The Editor with a \"purpose,\"\n      his vivid dramatic sense kept him from becoming merely didactic. The\n      little tragedy that takes place amongst this homely group of people makes\n      quite a moving play, thanks to the skill with which the types are depicted -- the\n      bourgeois father and mother, with their mixture of timidity and\n      self-interest; the manly, straightforward young politician, resolute to\n      carry on the work that has sapped his brother's life; the warped,\n      de-humanised nature of the journalist; the sturdy common-sense of the\n      yeoman farmer; and the doctor, the \"family friend,\" as a sort of mocking\n      chorus. Besides its plea for a higher regard for truth, the play also\n      attacks the precept, preached by worldly wisdom, that we ought to harden\n      our natures to make ourselves invulnerable; a proposition which was\n      hateful to one of Bj\u00f6rnson's persistently impressionable and ingenuous\n      nature. The fact remains, as Brandes grimly admits, that \"nowadays we have\n      only a very qualified sympathy with public characters who succumb to the\n      persecution of the press.\" Brandes sees in the play, besides its obvious\n      motive, an allegory. Halvdan Rejn, the weary and dying politician, is (he\n      says) meant for Henrik Wergeland, a Norwegian poet-politician who had\n      similar struggles, sank under the weight of similar at tacks, died after a\n      long illness, and was far higher reputed after his death than during his\n      life. In Harald Rejn, with his honest enthusiasm and misjudged political\n      endeavours Brandes sees Bj\u00f6rnson himself; while the yeoman brother,\n      Haakon, seems to him to typify the Norwegian people.",
                "The Bankrupt (En Fallit: literally A Bankruptcy) was\n      partly written in Rome, partly in Tyrol, and published at Copenhagen in\n      1875. It was a thing entirely new to the Scandinavian stage for a\n      dramatist to deal seriously with the tragi-comedy of money, and, while\n      making a forcible plea for honesty, to contrive to produce a stirring and\n      entertaining play on what might seem so prosaic a foundation as business\n      finance. Some of the play's earliest critics dismissed it as \"dry,\"\n      \"prosaic,\" \"trivial,\" because of the nature of its subject; but it made a\n      speedy success on the boards, and very soon became a popular item in the\n      repertories of the Christiania, Bergen and Copenhagen theatres. It was\n      actually first performed, in a Swedish translation, at Stockholm, a few\n      days before it was produced at Christiania. Very soon, too, the play\n      reached Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and other German and Austrian theatres. It\n      was played in Paris, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre in 1894. The character of\n      Berent, the lawyer, which became a favourite one with the famous Swedish\n      actor Ernst Possart, was admittedly more or less of a portrait of a\n      well-known Norwegian lawyer, by name Dunker. When Bj\u00f6rnson was writing the\n      play, he went to stay for some days with Dunker, who was to instruct him\n      as to the legal aspect of bankruptcy. Bj\u00f6rnson took the opportunity of\n      studying the lawyer as well as the law.",
                "The King (Kongen) was written at Aulestad, the Norwegian\n      home in which Bj\u00f6rnson settled after his return from abroad, and was\n      published at Copenhagen in 1877. It is perhaps not surprising that the\n      play, with its curious blend of poetry and social philosophy, and its\n      somewhat exuberant (though always interesting) wordiness, was not at first\n      a conspicuous success on the stage; but the interest aroused by the\n      published book was enormous. It was widely read and vigorously discussed,\n      both in Scandinavia and abroad; and while, on the one hand, it brought\n      upon Bj\u00f6rnson the most scurrilous abuse and the harshest criticism from\n      his political opponents, on the other hand a prominent compatriot of his\n      (whose opinion was worth having) gave it as his verdict, at a political\n      meeting held soon after the play's publication, that \"the most notable\n      thing that has happened in Norway of late -- or at any rate, one of the\n      most notable -- in my opinion is this last book of Bj\u00f6rnson's -- The\n      King.\"",
                "The idea of a \"democratic monarchy\" -- a kind of reformed\n      constitutional monarchy, that should be a half-way house on the road to\n      republicanism -- was not entirely new; Bj\u00f6rnson's success was in\n      presenting the problem as seen from the inside -- that is to\n      say, from the king's point of view. His opponents, of course, branded him\n      as a red-hot republican, which he was not. In a preface he wrote for a\n      later edition of the play, he says that he did not intend the play mainly\n      as an argument in favour of republicanism, but \"to extend the boundaries\n      of free discussion\"; but that, at the same time, he believed the republic\n      to be the ultimate form of government, and all European states to be\n      proceeding at varying rates of speed towards it.",
                "The King is composed of curiously incongruous elements. The railway\n      meeting in the first act is pure comedy of a kind to compare with the\n      meeting in Ibsen's An Enemy of Society; the last act is melodrama\n      with a large admixture of remarkably interesting social philosophy; the\n      intervening acts betray the poet that always underlay the dramatist in\n      Bj\u00f6rnson. The crudity, again, of the melodramatic appearance of the wraith\n      of Clara's father in the third act, contrasts strangely with the mature\n      thoughtfulness of much of the last act and with the tender charm of what\n      has gone before: And -- strangest incongruity of all in a play so\n      essentially \"actual\" -- there is in the original, between each act, a\n      mysterious \"mellemspil,\" or \"interlude,\" in verse, consisting of somewhat\n      cryptic dialogues between Genii and Unseen Choirs in the clouds, between\n      an \"Old Grey Man\" and a \"Chorus of Tyrants\" in a desolate scene of snow\n      and ice, between Choruses of Men, Women, and Children in a sylvan\n      landscape, and so forth -- their utterances being of the nature of the\n      obscurest choruses in the Greek dramatists, but for the most part with a\n      less obvious relevance to the play itself. Such a device leads the\n      present-day reader's thoughts inevitably to the use made of the \"unseen\n      chorus,\" in a similar way, by Thomas Hardy in The Dynasts; but\n      Hardy's interludes are closely relevant to his drama and help it on its\n      way, which Bj\u00f6rnson's do not. They have been entirely omitted in the\n      present translation, on the ground of their complete superfluity as well\n      as from the extreme difficulty of retaining their \"atmosphere\" in\n      translation.",
                "None of the three plays in the present volume have previously been\n      translated into English. German, French, and Swedish versions of The\n      Editor are extant; German, Swedish, Finnish, French, and Hungarian of\n      The Bankrupt; French and Spanish of The King.",

                "Evje. And most people read it. Besides, one can't deny that a lot of\n        what is in it is true, although its general tendency is to run everyone\n        down.",
                "Harald (getting up). Quite so, yes. (Leans over GERTRUD'S shoulder.)\n        Gertrud, have you read it?",
                "Gertrud (does not look at him, and hesitates for a moment; then says\n        gently): Yes.",
                "Harald (under his breath). So that is it! (Walks away from her.)",
                "Evje. We have had a little bit of a scene here, I must tell you.",
                "Harald (walking up and down). Yes, I can understand that.",
                "Evje. I will repeat what I have said already: they write about you,\n        and we have to suffer for it.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, and Gertrud especially.",
                "Gertrud. No -- I don't want anyone to consider me in the matter at\n        all. Besides, it is not what they say of you in the paper that hurts me -- .\n        (Stops abruptly.)",
                "Harald (who has come up to her). But what your parents are feeling about\n        it? Is that it? (GERTRUD does not answer.)",
                "Evje (pushing back his plate). There, I have finished! (They rise from\n        the table. MRS. EVJE helps INGEBORG to clear away the things, which\n        INGEBORG carries out of the room.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. Couldn't you wash your hands of politics, Harald? (GERTRUD\n        goes out to the left.)",
                "Evje (who has followed GERTRUD with his eyes). We cannot deny that it\n        pains us considerably that in our old age our peaceful home should be\n        invaded by all this squabbling and abomination.",
                "Mrs. Evje (who rung for INGEBORG to move the table). You have no need to\n        do it, either, Harald! You are a grown man, and your own master.\n        (INGEBORG comes in. HARALD helps her to move the table.)",
                "Evje (to his wife). Don't let Ingeborg hear. Come along, we will go into\n        my room.",
                "Mrs. Evje. You forget, all the windows are open there. I have had the\n        fire lit here, so that we could stay here.",
                "Evje. Very well -- then we will sit here. (Sits down by the fire.)\n        Will you have a cigar?",
                "Harald. No, thanks. (INGEBORG goes out.)",
                "Evje (taking a cigar and lighting it). As my wife said just now -- couldn't\n        you wash your hands of politics, Harald? You, who have both talent and\n        means, need not be at a loss for a vocation in life.",
                "Harald (sitting down on the sofa). If I have any talent, it is for\n        politics -- and so I intend to devote my means to that.",
                "Evje. What do you propose to gain by it?",
                "Harald. What any one who believes in a cause hopes to gain -- that is\n        to say, to help it on.",
                "Evje. And to become a cabinet minister?",
                "Harald. I certainly can't do that any other way; well, I admit -- that\n        is my idea.",
                "Evje. You will not be elected now.",
                "Harald. That we shall see.",
                "Evje. But suppose you are not re-elected to-morrow?",
                "Harald. Then I must find some other way.",
                "Evje. Always with the same object?",
                "Harald. Always with the same object. (EVJE sighs.)",
                "Mrs. Evje (who has taken her sewing and sat down by the fire). Oh, these\n        politics!",
                "Harald. At any rate, they are the most prominent factors in life just\n        now.",
                "Evje. We do not suppose we can exercise any influence over you. But at\n        any rate it is possible that you yourself have not considered the\n        position into which you have put the whole of us. (Both he and his wife\n        avoid looking at HARALD during this discussion.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. Say what you really mean, dear -- that he is making us all\n        thoroughly unhappy, and that is the truth!",
                "Harald (getting up, and walking up and down). Well, look here -- I\n        have a proposal to make. It is, that you should abandon all opposition\n        to Gertrud's marrying me at once. To-day again my brother has expressed\n        the wish that we should be married by his bedside; so that he should be\n        able to take part in it. I scarcely need add how happy it would make me.",
                "Evje. But whether she is here at home or married to you, you know, her\n        parents' distress would be just as great every time their child was\n        persecuted.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Surely you can appreciate that!",
                "Harald. But what answer am I to give to my brother's request? -- most\n        likely the last he will ever -- . (Stops.)",
                "Evje (after a pause). He is very kind to wish it, as he always is.\n        Nothing would make us happier; but we who are her parents do not\n        consider that you could make our daughter happy as long as you remain in\n        politics and on the lines on which you are now travelling.",
                "Harald (after a pause, during which he has stood still). That is to say,\n        you contemplate breaking off our engagement?",
                "Evje (looking at him quickly). Far from it!",
                "Mrs. Evje (at the same time). How can you say such a thing?",
                "Evje (turning towards the fire again). We have spoken about it to\n        Gertrud to-day -- as to whether it would not be possible to induce\n        you to choose some other career.",
                "Mrs. Evje. You understand now, why you found Gertrud upset. You must\n        listen to us now, as she did, in all friendliness.",
                "Evje (getting up and standing with his back to the fire). The first\n        thing I do in the morning is to read my paper. You know what was in it\n        to-day -- the same as is in it now every day.",
                "Mrs. Evje. No; I am sure it has never been as bad as to-day.",
                "Harald (walking up and down again). The election is just at hand!",
                "Evje. Well -- it is just as painful to us, her father and mother,\n        whether it is before or after the election. We are not accustomed to\n        associate with any one who has not first-class credentials -- and now\n        we have to endure seeing doubt cast upon our own son-in-law's. Do not\n        misunderstand me; to my mind, for credentials to be first-class they\n        must not only actually be so, but must also be considered to be so by\n        people in general. (HARALD begins to walk up and down again.) The second\n        thing I do in the morning is to open my letters. Amongst to-day's were\n        several from friends we had invited to a party we thought of giving -- if,\n        that is to say, your brother's illness took no sudden turn for the\n        worse. No fewer than ten of them refuse our invitation -- most of\n        them making some excuse, and a few with a little more show of a real\n        reason; but one of them speaks straight out, and I have his letter here.\n        (Takes it from his pocket.) I have kept it for you. It is from my\n        father's old friend, the bishop. I haven't my spectacles -- and for\n        me to have mislaid my spectacles will show you what a state of mind I am\n        in. I don't think I have done such a thing for -- . Here, read it\n        yourself! Read it aloud!",
                "Harald (taking the letter). \"My dear Mr. Evje. As you are my poor dear\n        friend's son, you must listen to the truth from me. I cannot willingly\n        come to your house while I might meet there a certain person who,\n        certainly, is one of you, but nevertheless is a person whom I cannot\n        hold in entire respect.\"",
                "Mrs. Evje. Well, Harald, what do you think our feelings must be when we\n        read things like that?",
                "Evje. Do not imagine that, in spite of that, we do not hold you\n        in entire respect. We only ask you to ensure our daughter's happiness.\n        You can do that with a word.",
                "Mrs. Evje. We know what you are, whatever people say -- even if they\n        are bishops. But, in return, you ought to have confidence in our\n        judgment; and our advice to you is, have done with it! Marry Gertrud at\n        once, and go away for your honeymoon; by the time you come back, people\n        will have got something else to talk about -- and you will have found\n        something else to occupy you as well.",
                "Evje. You must not misunderstand us. We mean no coercion. We are not\n        insisting on this alternative. If you wish to be married, you shall -- without\n        feeling yourself obliged to change your vocation for our sakes.\n        We only want to make it clear that it would pain us -- pain us very\n        deeply.",
                "Mrs. Evje. If you want to take time to think it over, or want to talk it\n        over with Gertrud or with your brother, do! (GERTRUD comes in and goes\n        about the room looking for something.)",
                "Evje. What are you looking for, dear?",
                "Gertrud. Oh, for the -- .",
                "Mrs. Evje. I expect it is the newspaper; your grandfather has been\n        asking for it.",
                "Evje. Surely there is no need for him to read it?",
                "Mrs. Evje. He asked me for it, too. He knows quite well what has made us\n        all unhappy.",
                "Evje. Can't you tell him? No, that wouldn't do.",
                "Mrs. Evje (to GERTRUD). I suppose you have had to confess to him what is\n        the matter?",
                "Gertrud (trying to conceal an emotion that is almost too much for her).\n        Yes. (Finds the paper, and goes out.)",
                "Mrs. Evje (when GERTRUD has gone). Poor child!",
                "Evje. Does not what she is carrying to him, with all that it says about\n        you and about your brother, seem to you like an omen? I will tell you\n        how it strikes me. Your brother is a very much more gifted man than I\n        am; and although it is true, as that paper says, that nothing of all\n        that he has worked for has ever come to anything, still perhaps he may\n        nevertheless have accomplished more than either you or me, although we\n        have done a good deal between us to increase the prosperity of our town.\n        I feel that to be so, although I cannot express what I mean precisely.\n        But consider the reputation he will leave behind him. All educated\n        people will say just what that paper says to-day -- and to-morrow he\n        will be forgotten. He will scarcely find a place in history, for history\n        only concerns itself with the great leaders of men. What does it all\n        come to, then? Neither present nor posthumous fame; but death -- death\n        all the time. He is dying by inches now, dying of the most horrible\n        persecution; and the emotion that his end will cause among a few\n        individuals cannot be called posthumous fame. (HARALD begins to speak,\n        but checks himself.) Can you hope to make a better fight of it?\n        You think you are stronger? Very well; perhaps you may have the strength\n        to endure it until other times come and other opinions with them. But\n        there will be one by your side who will not have the strength to endure\n        it. Gertrud is not strong -- she could never stand it; indeed now -- already -- .\n        (Is stopped by his emotion.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. She hides it from you, but she cannot hide it from us.\n        Besides, a friend of ours -- our dear doctor -- said only\n        yesterday -- . (Breaks off in tears.)",
                "Evje. We never told you, but he warned us some time ago; we had no idea\n        it was so serious, or that it had anything to do with this. But\n        yesterday he frightened us; he said she -- . Well, you can ask him\n        yourself. He will be here directly. (HARALD fills a glass of water and\n        raises it to his lips, but sets it down again untasted.)",
                "Mrs. Evje (going to him). I am so sorry for you, Harald! To have this\n        come on you just now -- when your splendid brother is at the point of\n        death, and you yourself are being persecuted! (A ring is heard at the\n        bell.)",
                "Evje. But it should be a warning to you! Sometimes a single movement\n        will change the course of a whole life.",
                "Mrs. Evje. And do have a little confidence in us! (A ring is heard\n        again.)",
                "Evje. What on earth has become of John to-day? That is the second time\n        the bell has rung.",
                "Mrs. Evje. One of the maids is opening the door, I can hear.",
                "Evje. I expect it is the doctor.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, it is he -- I know his ring. (A knock is heard at the\n        door.)",
                "Evje. Come in! (The DOCTOR comes in.)",
                "The Doctor. Good morning! (Lays down his hat and stick.) Well, so I hear\n        John has been up to his pranks again? The rascal is in bed.",
                "Evje and Mrs. Evje. In bed?",
                "The Doctor. Came home at four o'clock in the morning, drunk. Ill to-day,\n        naturally. Ingeborg asked me to go in and see him.",
                "Evje. Well! -- I am determined to put an end to it!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, I have never been able to understand why you were so\n        lenient with John.",
                "Evje. He has been with us five years; and, besides, it makes people talk\n        so, if you have to send your servants away.",
                "Mrs. Evje. But surely this sort of thing makes them talk much worse!",
                "Evje. Well -- he shall leave this very day.",
                "The Doctor (to HARALD). How are you, Rejn? -- Oho! I understand. I\n        have come at an inopportune moment with my complaints of John? You have\n        all got something more serious on your minds?",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, we have had it out, as we agreed yesterday.",
                "The Doctor. You must forgive me, my dear Rejn, for having told my old\n        friends the whole truth yesterday. She (pointing to MRS. EVJE) was an\n        old playfellow of mine, and her husband and I have been friends from\n        boyhood; so we have no secrets from each other. And Gertrud's condition\n        makes me very uneasy.",
                "Harald. Why have you never told me that before?",
                "The Doctor. Goodness knows I have often enough given her parents hints\n        that she was not well; but they have only made up their minds that her\n        happiness in her engagement would quite cure her. They are a considerate\n        couple, these two dear people, you know; they didn't want to seem\n        interfering.",
                "Harald. Their consideration -- which I appreciate and have lately had\n        constant reason to be grateful for -- has all at once become a more\n        powerful weapon than open opposition. It makes a duty of what I should\n        otherwise have felt to be unfair coercion. But now the situation is such\n        that I can neither go forward nor back. After what I have gone through,\n        you must see that I cannot withdraw on the very eve of the election -- and\n        after the election it will be too late. On the other hand -- (with\n        emotion) -- I cannot, I dare not, go on with it if it is to cost me -- .\n        (Breaks off.)",
                "Evje (standing in front of the fire). There, there! Take time to think\n        it over, my dear boy; talk it over with her and with your brother.",
                "The Doctor (who has sat down on a chair to the left, a little away from\n        the others). I have just been to see your brother. A remarkable man! But\n        do you know what occurred to me as I sat there? He is dying because he\n        is a man. The only people that are fit for political life\n        nowadays are those whose hearts have been turned to stone. (Picks up\n        something from the table and gets up.) Ah, just look here! Here is a\n        fine specimen of petrifaction. It is a fragment of palm leaf of some\n        kind, found impressed in a bit of rock from Spitzbergen. I sent it you\n        myself, so I know it. That is what you have to be like to withstand\n        arctic storms! -- it will take to harm. But your brother -- well,\n        his life had been like that of the original palm tree, with the air\n        sighing through its branches; the change of climate was too sudden for\n        him. (Goes up to HARALD.) You have still to try it. Shall you be able to\n        kill all the humanity that is in you? If you can make yourself as\n        insensate a thing as this stone, I daresay you will be able to stand the\n        life. But are you willing to venture upon political life at such a\n        price? If you are -- so be it; but remember that in that case you\n        must also kill all humanity in Gertrud -- in these two -- in every\n        one that is dear to you. Otherwise no one will understand you or follow\n        you. If you cannot do that, you will never be more than a dabbler in\n        politics -- a quarter, an eighth part, of a politician -- and all\n        your efforts, in what you consider your vocation, will be pitiable!",
                "Mrs. Evje (who has been occupied at the back of the room, but now sits\n        down by the fare). That is quite true! I know cases of petrifaction like\n        that -- and God preserve anyone that I love from it!",
                "Evje (coming forward towards HARALD). I don't want to say anything to\n        hurt your feelings -- least of all just now. But I just want to add\n        my warning, because I believe I have discovered that there is a danger\n        that persecution may make you hard.",
                "Harald. Yes! -- but do you suppose it is only politics that offer\n        that dangerous prospect?",
                "The Doctor. You are quite right! It is all the cry nowadays, \"Harden\n        yourself!\" It isn't only military men and doctors that have to be\n        hardened; commercial men have to be hardened, civil servants have to be\n        hardened, or dried up; and everybody else has to be hardened for life,\n        apparently. But what does it all mean? It means that we are to drive out\n        all warmth from our hearts, all desire from our imaginations. There is a\n        child's heart at the bottom of every one of our hearts-ever young, full\n        of laughter and tears; and that is what we shall have killed before we\n        are \"fitted for the battle of life,\" as they put it. No, no -- that\n        is what we ought to preserve; we were given it for that! (HARALD hides\n        his face in his hands, and sits so for some time.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. Any mother or any wife knows that.",
                "Evje (standing with his back to the fire). You want to bring back the\n        age of romance, doctor!",
                "The Doctor (with a laugh). Not its errors -- because in those days\n        unclean minds brought to birth a great deal that was unclean.\n        (Seriously.) But what is it, when all is said and done, but a violent\n        protest on the part of the Teutonic people against the Romanesque spirit\n        and school -- a remarkable school, but not ours. To us it\n        seems a barren, merely intellectual school -- a mere mass of formulas\n        which led to a precocious development of the mind. And that was the\n        spirit it bred -- critical and barren. But these schools of thought\n        are now all we have, and both of them are bad for us! They have no use\n        for the heart or the imagination; they do not breed faith or a longing\n        for high achievement. Look at our life! Is our life really our\n        own?",
                "Mrs. Evje. No. You have only to think of our language, our tastes, our\n        society, our --",
                "The Doctor (interrupting her). Those are the externals of our life,\n        merely the externals! No, look within -- look at such a view of life\n        as we were talking about, clamouring for \"hardening\" -- is that ours?\n        Can we, for all our diligence, make as much way in it as, for instance,\n        a born Parisian journalist? -- become like a bar of steel with a\n        point at each end, a pen-point and a sword-point? We can't do\n        that; the Teutonic temperament is not fitted for it.",
                "Evje. Oh, we are well on the way towards it. Look at the heartless\n        intolerance in our politics; it will soon match what you were\n        describing.",

                "The Doctor (laughing). Yes, and here in the north, in our small\n        communities, where a man meets all his enemies in the same barber's\n        shop, we feel it as keenly as if we were digging our knives into each\n        other! (Seriously.) We may laugh at it, but if we could add up the sum\n        of suffering that has been caused to families and to individuals -- if\n        we could see the concrete total before us -- we should be tempted to\n        believe that our liberty had been given to us as a curse! For it is\n        a cursed thing to destroy the humanity that is in us, and make us cruel\n        and hard to one another.",
                "Harald (getting up, but standing still). But, my good friends, if you\n        are of the same mind about that, and I with you -- what is the next\n        thing to do?",
                "The Doctor. The next thing to do?",

                "Harald. No. Every time there is anything nasty in it about me or mine,\n        it is sent to me anonymously.",
                "The Doctor (with a laugh). I don't take it in; I read my hall-porter's\n        copy.",
                "Harald. I have heard you say that before. I took an opportunity to ask\n        your hall-porter. He said he did not read it, and did not take it\n        in either.",

And, moreover, every one who is on terms of friendship with a\n        man who is destroying public morality, is helping him to do it.",

                "Harald. -- expressed your abhorrence of certain political tendencies\n        with which neither you nor I have any sympathy -- which affront our\n        ideas of humane conduct. You do not feel called upon to enter actively\n        into the lists against them; but why do you try to prevent those who do\n        feel so called upon? You lament the existing state of things -- and\n        yet you help to maintain it, and make a friend of the man who is its\n        champion!",

                "Harald. No -- I am. I was told a little while ago that I was in a\n        fair way to become hardened and callous, and that I must abandon my\n        career -- and that I must do so for Gertrud's sake, too, because she\n        would never be able to share the fight with me. I was told this at one\n        of the bitterest moments in my life. And that made me hesitate for a\n        moment.

                "Evje (fuming). Is your object to ruin that, then?",
                "Mrs. Evje. You will never succeed in that!",

                "The Editor. I have told you the truth openly. And, as far as that goes,\n        you have stood more than that from me in your own house, my boy. Because\n        the misfortune is that you are a coward.",
                "Evje. I a coward?",
                "The Doctor (laughing). Hush, hush! Let us remember we are gentlefolk!",
                "Evje. Yes, I have been weak enough to be afraid of scandal, especially\n        in the newspapers, it is true; that is why I have put up with you too\n        long! But now you shall see that I am not a coward. Leave my house!",
                "Mrs. Evje. That's right!",
                "The Doctor. But you must part like gentlefolk, you know.",
                "The Editor. Pooh! You will be sending me a message directly, to call me\n        back!",
                "Evje. You have the face to say that?",
                "Mrs. Evje (to EVJE). Come, dear, don't provoke him any more!",
                "The Editor (turning to go). You daren't do otherwise.",
                "The Doctor. But part like gentlefolk -- !",

                "The Doctor. Don't part like that! Part like gentle --",
                "Evje. No, I tell you!",
                "The Editor (laughing all the time). Yes!",
                "Mrs. Evje. My dear-remember you may bring on one of your attacks!",
                "The Editor (at the door). You are too much of a coward! Ha! ha! (Goes\n        out.)",
                "Evje (in a rage). No!",
                "The Editor (sticking his head in at the door). Yes! (Goes away.)",
                "The Doctor. What a visit! I cannot help laughing, all the same! Ha, ha,\n        ha, ha!",
                "Evje. Do you dare to laugh at that?",
                "The Doctor. \"Old schoolfellows\" -- ha, ha! \"Moderation\" -- ha, ha!\n        \"The same party\" -- ha, ha, ha!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Oh, my husband is ill!",
                "Evje (faintly). Yes -- a little water!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Water, water, Harald!",
                "The Doctor. One of his attacks -- that is another affair altogether.\n        Here (takes a bottle from his pocket) -- smell this! That's it! Now,\n        a little water! (Gives him some.) No danger this time. Cheer up, old\n        boy!",
                "Evje. What a scandal!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, you will never be able to bear it, dear; I told you so.",
                "Evje. To think of my name appearing in the papers, when all my\n        life I have --",
                "Mrs. Evje. -- done everything you could to keep clear of such things!\n        And you such a dear, good, upright man! -- Oh, these politics are the\n        curse of the world!",
                "The Doctor (laughing). As I told you, you must go through a special\n        process of hardening before you can stand them.",
                "Evje. And think of public opinion -- my position -- my\n        connections! It is more than I can bear!",
                "Mrs. Evje (to the Doctor). I am sure the first time he reads something\n        about himself in the paper, it will make him really ill! He won't be\n        able to stand it, I know.",
                "The Doctor. Oh, he will get over it.",
                "Mrs. Evje. No, he won't. I am frightened at the mere thought of it. He\n        will never be able to bear it, never!",
                "Evje. When all my life I have tried to keep clear of such things -- !",
                "Mrs. Evje. And now in your old age, though you deserve it no more than a\n        child does, to be dragged into it! If I could prevent that, I would\n        willingly take on my own shoulders whatever --",
                "Evje. No, no -- not you! Not you!",
                "The Doctor. But the thing is not necessarily done because he threatened\n        he would do it.",
                "Evje. Do you think -- ?",
                "The Doctor. He is so dreadfully hot-headed, but I am sure he will think\n        twice --",
                "Mrs. Evje. -- before he attacks a lifelong friend! Yes, that is so,\n        isn't it!",
                "Evje. Do you really think that there is any possibility then -- ?",
                "The Doctor. I really can't say!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Nothing in the world is impossible!",
                "Evje. We were both so hot-headed.",
                "The Doctor. Yes, it will have to be a more peaceable conversation than\n        that of a few minutes ago!",
                "Evje. I don't know how it is -- there is something so provoking about\n        him.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, and you have not been very well lately, either. I have\n        often said so to you.",
                "Evje. No, I haven't. It has been just one thing after another! And all\n        my life I have tried to keep clear of such things!",
                "The Doctor. I will tell you what, old friend; I am sure the best thing\n        to do would be --",
                "Evje. What?",
                "The Doctor. I am sure you will not be easy in your mind until someone\n        has talked to him.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, couldn't that be done? Good gracious, that is not\n        sending a message to him!",
                "Evje. But who would -- ? (A short silence.)",
                "The Doctor. I don't know who would be best.",
                "Mrs. Evje. All our old friends have deserted us; we shall soon have\n        none.",
                "The Doctor. Well, at all events, you have me.",
                "Evje. Would you really be willing to -- ? Do you mean it? (Grasps his\n        hand.)",
                "The Doctor. Of course I will! He can't eat me!",
                "Mrs. Evje. How good you are! Of course you only need tell him -- what\n        is quite true -- that my husband would never be able to bear it! He,\n        who all these years --",
                "Evje. -- have put up with an incredible amount for his sake, both\n        from himself and from others!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, that is true! And now you will go, dear friend -- our\n        only friend! -- and talk to him quite amicably and sensibly, won't\n        you?",
                "Evje. But don't delay! He is so hot-headed that we must find him before --",
                "The Doctor. Oh, I will find him; he is always about the town.",
                "Evje. And tell him -- ask him --",
                "The Doctor. Oh, I know what to say to him.",
                "Mrs. Evje. That is right!",
                "Evje. Thank you! I shall never forget how, at a moment when everything\n        threatened to overwhelm me, you were the only one to stand by me! Ah, I\n        feel as if a load had fallen off my shoulders! I feel all at once quite\n        happy again!",
                "The Doctor. That's right. You pull yourself together! I will see to\n        everything else.",
                "Evje. Thanks, thanks! But make haste!",
                "The Doctor. I am off! My hat? (Turns, and sees HARALD, and says to\n        himself.) A-ha! He looks as if he had had about enough of this. It would\n        have been a joke to --",
                "Evje. Oh, do make haste, my friend!",
                "The Doctor. Yes, yes -- if only I could find my hat.",
                "Mrs. Evje. It is on the table.",
                "The Doctor. So it is!",
                "Evje. Good luck to you!",
                "Mrs. Evje. And do it very tactfully!",
                "The Doctor (meaningly). And I hope you three will enjoy yourselves!\n        (Goes out.)",
                "Evje. What a morning!",
                "Mrs. Evje. We, who have always endeavoured to take everything quietly\n        and indulgently --",
                "Evje. Yes, and to conduct our family affairs peaceably and\n        affectionately! (Jumps up and turns to HARALD.) The whole thing is your\n        fault!",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, it is Harald's fault! From the day this unfortunate\n        engagement came about, we have scarcely had a moment's peace here.",
                "Evje. No, no, that is not the case! We must be reasonable. At first,\n        when Mr. Rejn had a fine future before him, when people vied with one\n        another to catch him, then the engagement was an honour to us as well as\n        to our daughter. But from the moment he took up these wretched politics -- that\n        is to say, from the time his brother fell ill -- well, he can see for\n        himself what the result has been to us!",
                "Mrs. Evje. And he certainly must admit that it is not what we have\n        deserved; indeed it is more than a respected and well-bred family can\n        put up with.",
                "Harald. I quite agree that it is more than a respected and well-bred\n        family ought to put up with.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Oh, so you feel that too?",
                "Harald. Certainly. And the only excuse I can see is that there are many\n        more in the same case. It is only in that way that such things become\n        possible.",
                "Evje. I do not understand. Many more like -- ? -- like whom?",
                "Harald. Like you!",
                "Mrs. Evje. In what respect?",
                "Harald. I will explain. Most of the successful politicians nowadays have\n        not gained their position by means of any greatness of their own, but by\n        the pitiable weakness of others. Another age will form a different\n        estimate of them -- see them in their proper perspective, and find\n        them to be much smaller men!",
                "Evje. But what has that to do with us?",
                "Harald. Well, just try to size up that man whom a little while ago you\n        turned out of your house and afterwards sent a message to --",
                "Evje. We sent no message to him!",
                "Mrs. Evje. A friend of ours has gone to talk to him. That is quite a\n        different thing!",
                "Harald. Well, take his measure by yours and yours by his! He went away,\n        and he will come back like a conquering hero. Will that be thanks to his\n        greatness, or his talent -- to the loftiness of his opinions or his\n        feelings? No, -- it will be thanks to your pitiable weakness.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Upon my word!",
                "Evje. Well, I -- !",
                "Harald. Do you think any one who has any pluck in his disposition would\n        consent to be a party to such a contemptible state of things? Think of\n        your own daughter, educated by that good old man who lies in there, but\n        an obedient child to you; think how she must be perpetually torn between\n        what she loves and respects and what she sees going on here! No wonder\n        she is ill! But remember this -- she is not ill because she sticks to\n        me; she is ill because of your pitiable weakness!",
                "Mrs. Evje. How can you dare to say such things! So you too -- !",
                "Evje. Such an absolute want of respect!",
                "Harald. Listen to me, once for all. I intend, God helping me, to take up\n        the fight that has killed my brother, the noblest man I know! And\n        Gertrud is going to take up her share in the fight, as I do mine.\n        But to come to this house as long as he comes here -- to go\n        through what I have gone through to-day -- sullies my self-respect to\n        such an extent, and offends my better feelings so deeply, that either he\n        never sets foot here again, or I do not!",
                "Evje and Mrs. Evje. But -- !",
                "Harald (quietly). When I came here to-day, I thought we should be able\n        to arrange matters without my speaking out; but there is nothing else\n        for it, so good-bye! (Goes out. A moment's silence follows.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. Is he giving us our dismissal? Or does he not\n        really mean to break with us? -- My dear, what is the matter? (Goes\n        to her husband's side.)",
                "Evje (without moving). Tell me, my dear -- am I a bad man?",
                "Mrs. Evje. You, a bad man?",
                "Evje. Because, if I were not a bad, wicked man, they could not behave in\n        such a way to me, one after the other.",
                "Mrs. Evje. But, my dear, you are the best and dearest and most\n        considerate of men! And they are shameless traitors to you, my dear\n        husband!",
                "Evje. But how on earth, then, could it come about that I, who all my\n        life have tried to keep clear of such things -- for I have, haven't\n        I?",
                "Mrs. Evje. Every one knows that, that knows anything about you.",
                "Evje. How could it come about that in my old age I should be despised\n        and forsaken by everybody? Surely it is no crime to want to live in\n        peace, apart from all that sort of thing?",
                "Mrs. Evje. No, indeed; that is what all decent people want to do.",
                "Evje. Yes, I thought so too. But now you see!",
                "Mrs. Evje. But you have been dreadfully unfortunate.",
                "Evje. Why should I have been just the one to be dreadfully unfortunate?\n        Most people escape such things altogether.",
                "Mrs. Evje (starting). Here is Gertrud.",
                "Evje. Poor child!",
                "Mrs. Evje. What on earth are we to say to her?",
                "Evje. Be careful, my dear! be careful! (GERTRUD comes in quietly and\n        comes forward to them.)",
                "Gertrud. Did I see Harald go away?",
                "Mrs. Evje. Yes, my child, he -- he went away.",
                "Gertrud. Without saying good-bye to me?",
                "Evje. That's true, he didn't say good-bye to you.",
                "Mrs. Evje. Were you expecting him to come into grandfather's room to say\n        good-bye to you?",
                "Gertrud. Yes. Tell me how things went here?",
                "Evje. Why were you not here, dear?",
                "Gertrud (in astonishment). I here? You said you did not want me to be\n        present --",
                "Evje. I remember, yes; we thought it would not be advisable.",
                "Gertrud (still speaking quietly, but in growing alarm). But how did\n        things go, then?",
                "Evje. How did they go? Badly.",
                "Mrs. Evje (hurriedly). That is to say, he did not behave at all well.\n        You must prepare yourself for the worst, my child!",
                "Gertrud. Is it something very bad, then?",
                "Evje. You know he is a little hasty just now, when he has so much on his\n        hands. He lacks a proper sense of moderation -- but he will learn it,\n        sure enough.",
                "Gertrud (almost inaudibly). But what does it mean? Is he never coming\n        back?",
                "Evje. Never coming back? What an extraordinary question! Of course he\n        will come back. He was only a little over-hasty, you know --",
                "Gertrud. And said he would never come back?",
                "Mrs. Evje. Come, come, my dear -- you mustn't be alarmed.",
                "Evje. He talked such a lot, you know, that we must not attach any\n        particular importance to anything he said.",
                "Gertrud. So that is how it is!",
                "Mrs. Evje. We must make allowances for all that he is going through just\n        now --",

Between it\n        and another street running parallel with it in the background, are two\n        houses standing in gardens, half of the facade of one of them projecting\n        into the stage on the right. On the left a third street runs at right\n        angles to the others, to the back of the stage. The left side of this\n        third street opens onto a well-wooded park. The house in the foreground\n        on the right is in two stories. There is a narrow strip of garden in\n        front of it, enclosed by an iron railing with a gate in it. The gate is\n        standing open. The entrance door to the house is immediately behind this\n        gate. There is light in a small window by the door; the ground floor\n        windows are in darkness; in those of the upper floor, light is visible\n        through heavy curtains. It is a wintry evening, and everything is\n        swathed in an unusually thick fog, in which the gas lamps in the streets\n        show dimmer and dimmer as they recede in the distance. As the curtain\n        goes up, a lamplighter is seen descending his ladder from a lamp-post,\n        where he has just lit the lamp at the corner of the house.)",
                "The Lamplighter (as he reaches the ground). It's all one whether the\n        lamps are lit or not, in such a fog as this. (MRS. EVJE is seen drawing\n        back the curtain at a window on the first floor. She opens the window\n        and looks out.)",
                "Mrs. Evje. The fog is so thick, my dear, that I can't see across the\n        street.",

                "First Passer-by. The Land of Fogs -- the old idea of the land of Fogs\n        was that of a vision of confused and faint sensation, with the light of\n        the intelligence dimmed and blurred like these gas lamps in the fog.",

Look at this house behind\n        us -- the brandy distiller's. The devilish workings of his\n        intelligence have befogged the whole country -- befogged it with\n        brandy -- and some such guiding light is much needed there.",
                "First Passer-by. Ah, well, -- the old idea of the Land of Fogs was\n        that fogs were -- . (The sound of their conversation dies away as\n        they pass into the park on the left. GERTRUD, closely veiled and wrapped\n        in furs, comes slowly out of the park. She stops at the corner and looks\n        down the street, then passed slowly along to the right, looking up at\n        the house as she goes. She is scarcely out of sight when the house-door\n        opens and EVJE comes out.)",
                "Evje. This is about the time he comes home -- I daren't go to his\n        house and ask for him; I don't know if he would admit me. I daren't\n        trust to the Doctor alone. -- This uncertainty is dreadful! (He\n        starts at seeing GERTRUD, whom he does not recognise in the fog, walking\n        towards him. She turns suddenly and walks back the way she came.) Who\n        was that? She gave me quite a fright in this fog! Her furs seemed rather\n        like -- no, no, it couldn't be. I must not let any one recognise me.\n        (Puts up the high collar of his coat, so that only his nose is visible.)\n        Both of them called me a coward, but they are very much mistaken. It is\n        not cowardice for a man who is respected and honoured to try and avoid\n        scandal. Hm! Naturally those who trade in scandals think otherwise! -- To\n        act without attaching weight to the opinion of others, to disregard\n        one's own predilections, to put up with being laughed at -- all for\n        the sake of preventing a scandal -- that is to be strong and\n        courageous. And it is admirable, too; for it is admirable to act\n        fearlessly in the interest of one's family, and of one's business, and\n        of propriety. (Starts as he hears his door opened. JOHN has come along\n        the street and gone into the house.) Is that some one coming out of my\n        house? No, it is a man going in. And then to think of Harald Rejn\n        beginning that nonsense about my being a coward, because I refused to\n        become a party man! Every one ought to take sides in politics -- that\n        is their cry. Hm! I should say it required rather more courage nowadays\n        to refrain from taking sides. (Starts again.) Who is that? Oh,\n        only that woman again. She is waiting for some one too. I expect we\n        shall both catch bad colds. (Walks up and down.) It is an odd sensation\n        to be walking up and down on the watch outside one's own house.\n        Cowardice? Pshaw! To let one's self be abused in a public street without\n        stirring a finger to prevent it, that would be cowardice. I only\n        hope he has not gone round the other way? There is much more traffic in\n        that street, and some one might easily -- . I think I will take a\n        turn towards the town, and turn back when I am a little way from here;\n        it will look less suspicious. I must catch him, because his paper will\n        be going to press. (Looks up at his house.) My poor wife, sitting up\n        there dreadfully alarmed on my account! (Goes out to the right. As soon\n        as he has gone, the house-door opens and JOHN comes warily out.)",
                "JOHN. So he has gone out, has he! Oh, well, he is bound to come in\n        again! I will wait and catch him, that I will! Tra, la, la, la, la! I\n        can play about here in the fog till he comes back; I have nothing to\n        lose! And it will be best to catch him in the street; he will make less\n        fuss, and can't run away from me! Tra, la, la, la, la! (Lounges out to\n        the right. A moment later, HARALD comes out of the park. He is dressed\n        much as EVJE is, but has not his coat-collar turned up.)",
                "Harald. There is a light in her window! Then she is alone in her room.\n        What am I going to do now? Twice already I have come to look at that\n        light; now I have seen it -- and must go away! Good-bye, my darling!\n        Be patient, and wait! I know your thoughts are with me now; and I know\n        you feel that mine are with you! (As he turns away from the house he\n        sees the veiled figure of GERTRUD, who, as soon as she has come nearer,\n        rushes to him, throws up her veil, and falls into his arms in a glad\n        embrace.)",
                "Gertrud. I was certain that, if you could not go into the house again,\n        you would be out here! I knew you would not go away from me, dear!",
                "Harald. No -- neither now nor ever.",
                "Gertrud. And, while I was walking up and down here in the fog, I felt\n        that though there might be all this gloom tend cold around us outside,\n        there was the brightness and warmth of certainty in our hearts.",
                "Harald. Yes, our love is the one certainty for me! Fog may obscure the\n        goal I aim at, the road I have to I read, the very ground I stand on;\n        doubts may even for a while attack my faith; but my love for you shines\n        clear through it all!",
                "Gertrud. Thank you, my darling! If that is so, there is nothing that we\n        cannot overcome!",
                "Harald. Of course, you know what took place to-day?",
                "Gertrud. I can guess.",
                "Harald. Is it true that you are ill? Why did you never tell me?",
                "Gertrud. No, the doctor is not telling the truth; I am not ill! Even if\n        I were, what matter? I should go on living as long as I could -- and\n        should have done my duty before I gave in!",
                "Harald. That is the way to look at it!",
                "Gertrud. But I am not ill! I suffer, it is true -- and am likely to -- every\n        time you are persecuted, or my parents on my account. Because I\n        have drawn them into all this that, they are so unfitted for, and that\n        is why it pains me so to see how unprepared it finds them -- most of\n        all when, out of tenderness for me, they try to conceal it. But I can't\n        alter things. We are fighting for a cause that you believe to be right,\n        and so do I; surely that is better than never to suffer at all in any\n        good cause. Try me! Let me share the fight with you! I am not weak; it\n        is only that my heart is sore for those I love.",
                "Harald. You splendid, loyal creature! -- and you are mine! (Embraces\n        her.)",
                "Gertrud. You should hear what grandfather says!",
                "Harald. Yes, how is the dear old gentleman?",
                "Gertrud. Pretty well, thanks, though he never gets out now. But he is\n        following your work, and he says that what you are aiming at is right,\n        if you ask for God's guidance on your way. Harald -- you will always\n        be the same as you are now -- good and genuine -- won't you, dear?\n        Not like the rest of them -- nothing but bitterness and malice,\n        always talking of principles and consequences and all the rest of it,\n        and always attacking others? If one were obliged to be like that, it\n        would be a curse to be a politician.",
                "Harald. I will be what you make me! I think that behind every man's\n        public life you can see his private life -- whether he has a real\n        home, and what it is like, or whether he only has a place he lives in -- that\n        is to say, no real home.",
                "Gertrud. With God's help I shall try to make a bright, snug and cosy\n        home for you! And this fog is delightful, because it only makes the\n        thought of such a home all the cosier and snugger! It makes us seem so\n        alone, too; no one is out driving or walking; and we can talk as loud as\n        we please, because the fog deadens the sound of our voices. Oh, I feel\n        so happy again now! Do you know, I think it is rather nice to be\n        persecuted a little; it makes our meetings so much more precious!",
                "Harald. But, you know dear, to meet you like this -- and just now --",
                "Gertrud (as they walk up and down together). Yes, of course! I had\n        altogether forgotten how much you have to bear just now; I have been\n        chattering away -- . Oh, I don't know how I could feel so happy,\n        because I am really dreadfully distressed. But, you know, I sit the\n        whole play beside grandfather, thinking, without even being able to\n        talk. I generally read aloud to him; now and then he makes a remark, but\n        he really lives more in the next world than in this one now. (They hear\n        a cough in the distance, and give a start, because they recognise it.\n        The EDITOR and EVJE, walking along together, EVJE apparently talking\n        very earnestly, are seen, indistinctly through the fog, in the street\n        running parallel with the one HARALD and GERTRUD are in. JOHN is seen\n        following them cautiously. They disappear into the park.)",
                "Harald. I hear the enemy! I am sure I caught a glimpse of him over there\n        through the fog, talking to another man.",
                "Gertrud. Is he always about the streets even in weather like this?",
                "Harald. Well, we won't let him disturb us. (They begin walking up and\n        down again in front of the house.)",
                "Gertrud. Do you know whom I met out here? Father!",
                "Harald. Really? Then it is as I thought; the other man over there was\n        your father!",
                "Gertrud. Do you think it was? Poor father!",
                "Harald. Yes, he is weak.",
                "Gertrud. But you must be good to him. He is so good himself. Think how\n        mother loves him; she is absolutely wrapped up in him, because he is so\n        good!",
                "Harald. He is a good man, and an able man. But, but, but --",
                "Gertrud. They have lived a very tranquil life. We of the younger\n        generation try to undertake heavier duties and greater responsibilities\n        than the older generation did. But we must not be angry with them.",
                "Harald. I am afraid it is only too easy to feel angry with them.",
                "Gertrud. No, do as grandfather does! If he thinks any one is going to be\n        amenable to it, he talks to them quietly; if not, he only behaves\n        affectionately to them. Do you understand, dear? -- just\n        affectionately.",
                "Harald. Well, to-day -- ought I to have put up with their allowing\n        themselves to be treated in such an unseemly way, and their treating me\n        in such an unseemly way?",
                "Gertrud. Was it really as bad as that?",
                "Harald. You would not believe what it was like, I assure you!",
                "Gertrud (standing still). Poor father! Poor father! (Throws her arms\n        round HARALD'S neck.) Be good to them, Harald! -- just because of\n        their faults, dear! We are their children, you know, and it is God's\n        commandment, even if we were not their children.",
                "Harald. If only I could take you up in my arms and carry you off home\n        with me now! Your love takes possession of my heart and my will, and\n        purifies both of them. I am at a crisis in my life now -- and now you\n        should be on my side!",
                "Gertrud. Listen! -- to begin with, I will go with you to your meeting\n        to-night!",
                "Harald. Yes, yes, -- I will come and fetch you!",
                "Gertrud. Down at the door here!",
                "Harald. Yes!",
                "Gertrud. And, in the next place, I am going to walls into the town with\n        you now.",
                "Harald. But then I shall have to see you home again.",
                "Gertrud. Do you object?",
                "Harald. No, no! And you shall teach me a lot of things on the way!",
                "Gertrud. Yes, you will be so wise before we get back! (They go out to\n        the right.)",
                "(The EDITOR and EVJE come out of the park. JOHN follows them, unseen by\n        them, and slips past them to the right when they stop for a moment. The\n        following conversation is carried on in hurried tones, and every time\n        the EDITOR raises his voice EVJE hushes him, and speaks himself in a\n        persistently lowered voice.)",
                "Evje. But what concern of yours -- or of the public's -- are my\n        private affairs? I don't want to have anything to do with politics.",
                "The Editor, Well, then, you ought not to have had anything to do with him.",
                "Evje. When I first made his acquaintance he was not a politician.",
                "The Editor. Then you ought to have dropped him when he became one.",
                "Evje. Ought I to have dropped you too, when you became one?",
                "The Editor. Let me repeat, for the last time, that we are not talking\n        about me!",
                "Evje. Hush, hush! What a fellow you are! You get into a rage if any one\n        chaffs you. But you want to hit out at everybody all round!",
                "The Editor. Do you suppose I am myself?",
                "Evje. Who the devil are you, if you are not yourself?",
                "The Editor. I am merely the servant of the public.",
                "Evje. The public executioner, that is to say?",
                "The Editor. Well, yes, if you prefer it. But you shall pay for that word\n        some day.",
                "Evje. There -- you see! Always talking of paying for things! -- of\n        revenge!",
                "The Editor. You shall pay for it, I tell you!",
                "Evje. You are absolutely mad! -- Poof! I am sweating as if it were\n        the dog days! (Changes his tone.) Think of the time when we used to go\n        to school together -- when you never could go to bed without first\n        coming to thank me for the jolly times we were having together!",
                "The Editor. None of that nonsense! I am accustomed to be hated,\n        despised, spit upon, scourged; if any one speaks kindly to me, I do not\n        trust them!",
                "Evje. You must trust me!",
                "The Editor. No -- and, besides, I observed very clearly to-day that\n        you had counted on having me in reserve if ever you got into a scrape.",
                "Evje. Well, who doesn't count on his friends? Doesn't every one take\n        them into his reckoning?",
                "The Editor. I don't; I have no friends.",
                "Evje. Haven't you me? Do you think I would leave you in the lurch?",
                "The Editor. That is hypocrisy! At times when I have needed it, the very\n        last thing you have thought of has been to give me any help!",
                "Evje. Have I not helped you?",
                "The Editor. That is hypocrisy, too-to pretend you think I am speaking of\n        money. No; when I have been accused of being dishonourable -- of\n        lying -- you, the \"old schoolfellow,\" the \"old friend,\" the\n        \"neighbour,\" have never once had the courage to come forward on my\n        behalf.",
                "Evje. I never meddle with politics.",
                "The Editor (with rising temper). More hypocrisy! Another of your damned\n        evasions!",
                "Evje. Hush, hush, hush!",
                "The Editor. You try to excuse yourself with a lie! You are doubly a\n        traitor! -- And then you expect me to have compassion on you!",
                "Evje. As sure as I stand here, I have never thought of deserting you,\n        however bad things were.",
                "The Editor. And you have the face to take credit to yourself for that?\n        It is all calculation from beginning to end! You thought it would be the\n        best way of making me remember your loyalty, and reward you for it.",
                "Evje. This is abominable!",
                "The Editor. Oh, you are cunning enough! You represent wealth of another\n        kind, which at first was not entirely irreproachably come by --",
                "Evje. There you go again!",
                "The Editor. -- and want to give it the cachet of good society; so you\n        take care to keep friends with a newspaper that may be able to give you\n        a helping hand in gaining what you want. Can you deny it?",
                "Evje. There may be a slight tinge of calculation even in our highest\n        purposes. But the misfortune about you is that you can see nothing but\n        the calculation, though it may be only an infinitesimal part of the\n        whole thing.",
                "The Editor. Oho -- I have had experience of you!",
                "Evje. Then you must have had experience of your party's loyalty, too.",
                "The Editor. My party's loyalty!",
                "Evje. Well, after all, it keeps you where you are to-day.",
                "The Editor. It keeps me there?",
                "Evje. And you have friends in that party-myself amongst others -- who\n        certainly would rather stand outside altogether, but nevertheless give\n        you their advice and support when you are in difficulties. You cannot\n        deny that.",
                "The Editor. I have friends in the party? Oh yes; and if we lose a fight\n        these fine counsellors are the first to run away! They are always egging\n        me on and egging me on; but only let public opinion once get tired of\n        me, and they will throw me overboard without more ado! By that sort of\n        treachery they manage to fill the sails of the party craft with a new\n        breeze -- and leave me to shift the best way I can! -- they, for\n        whom I have fought with all my might and main! I despise my opponents -- they\n        are either scoundrels and thieves, or they are blockheads and braggarts.\n        But my supporters are lick-spittles, fools, cravens. I despise the whole\n        pack of them, from first to last! If any one would give me the assurance\n        that if, as a pledge that I would never use a pen again, I were to chop\n        off my right hand I should thereby gain the prospect of a peaceful life\n        a thousand miles away from here, I believe I would do it! -- I\n        despise the whole pack of them -- oh, how I despise them!",
                "Evje. But this is horrible! Do you find no comfort in religion? Or, at\n        all events, you have your paper!",
                "The Editor. My paper, yes -- but what good do you suppose that is to\n        me? And do you think I give the impression of being a religious man?",
                "Evje. Then what do you work for?",
                "The Editor. Perhaps you think I work for your sake? -- or for the\n        sake of prosperity, or order, or whatever it is you cowards or\n        self-seekers like to imagine it is that you personify? No, the whole\n        human race is not worth the powder and shot that they are holding at\n        each other's heads.",
                "Evje. Then why do you come and almost threaten my life, if the whole\n        thing seems so worthless to you?",
                "The Editor. Do you seriously suppose that I would give in, so as to\n        spare you or some other shopkeeper? -- so that you should be able to\n        say triumphantly, \"You see he didn't dare! He didn't dare quarrel with\n        Capital!\" -- or, \"You see he has given in -- he has turned tail!\"\n        No; what I should like to do would be to lay a mine underground, and\n        blow myself and the whole lot of you sky high!",
                "Evje. And I and all the happiness of my family life are to be sacrificed\n        in order that you shall not have to give in on a side issue of no\n        importance! -- Oh, I am chilled to the bone!",
                "The Editor. Ha, ha! It is good to hear you speaking like yourself again,\n        because it reminds me that it is time to put an end to this solemn\n        nonsense! (Looks at his watch.) A quarter past! You must be quick!",
                "Evje. Are you really in earnest?",
                "The Editor. I often play off jokes on you, it is true. But I don't know\n        how you will like this one to-morrow morning.",
                "Evje. Then let me tell you that I solemnly refuse! I will not break off\n        the engagement! Put me in your paper, if you like; I am a free man.",
                "The Editor. Bah! nobody is that. Then you refuse? Good-bye! (Walks away\n        from EVJE.)",
                "Evje (going after him). No, no -- where are you going?",
                "The Editor (stopping). Nowhere -- or rather, I am going home.",
                "Evje. But you won't really do what you said?",
                "The Editor. Ha! ha! ha! (Moves away.)",
                "Evje (following him). No, listen! Listen to me for a minute.",
                "The Editor (turning back). Do you think I have time to stop at all the\n        stations your vanity or your fright will invent on the way? (Moves\n        away.)",
                "Evje. You mad creature -- listen to me! (The EDITOR stops.) Tell me\n        exactly what you mean to do?",
                "The Editor. Fiddlesticks! (Moves on.)",
                "Evje (following him). Do you mean to put in the paper that I have broken\n        off this match?",
                "The Editor (stopping). Better than that -- I shall spread the news in\n        the town; then it will get about, and all the journalists will get a\n        hold of it.",
                "Evje. Give me a day or two to think it over!",
                "The Editor. Oh, no -- you are not going to catch me like that! It is\n        election time, and the other side must be made to feel that all decent\n        people have deserted them.",
                "Evje. But it is a lie, you know!",
                "The Editor. What is lying, and what is truth? But your resignation from\n        the Stock Exchange Committee and your subsequent failure to be elected\n        to any public position will be no lies, I can assure you! Public opinion\n        is not to be trifled with, you know!",
                "Evje. And this from you!",
                "The Editor. Bah! Public opinion is a very faithless friend.",
                "Evje. But who, after all, constitute public opinion?",
                "The Editor. Oh, no -- you are not going to lead me into a trap again!\n        Besides -- it would be very difficult to say exactly who does\n        constitute it.",
                "Evje. This is really -- ! Then you won't put that in the paper?",
                "The Editor. The news of a broken engagement travels quickest by\n        foot-post -- ha, ha, ha! (Coughs; then adds seriously:) But won't\n        you, of your own accord, break off what are really absolutely\n        inadmissible relations with a man who scandalises all your\n        acquaintances?",
                "Evje. Lay the blame on me, of course! I know his credentials are no\n        longer first class; but my daughter -- ah, you would not be able to\n        understand that. The circumstances are quite exceptional, and -- .\n        Look here, shall we go up and talk it over with my wife?",
                "The Editor. Ha, ha! -- you turned me out of the house this morning!",
                "Evje. Oh, forget all about that!",
                "The Editor (looking at his watch). Half past! Now, without any more\n        evasions -- will you, or will you not?",
                "Evje (with a struggle). No! I repeat, no! (The EDITOR moves away.) Yes,\n        yes! -- It nearly kills me to do it!",
                "The Editor. \"The Capitalist, secure in his position, who needs pay no\n        regard to,\" etc., etc. -- that is the \"common form,\" isn't it, you\n        man of first-class credentials? Ha, ha! Good-bye. I am going home to\n        send the boy to the printers; he has waited long enough. (Moves away.)",
                "Evje (following him). You are the cruellest, hardest, most reckless --",
                "The Editor (who has been laughing, suddenly becomes serious). Hush! Do\n        you see?",
                "Evje (turning round). What? Where?",
                "The Editor. Over there!",
                "Evje. Those two?",
                "The Editor. Yes -- your daughter and Mr. Harald Rejn.",
                "Evje. But he swore this morning that he would never set foot in my house\n        again!",
                "The Editor. But he will stay outside your house, as you see!\n        These gentlemen of the Opposition, when they give any assurance, always\n        do it with a mental reservation! You can't trust the beggars! Come round\n        the corner. (They do so.)",
                "Evje. An assignation in the street in the fog! To think my daughter\n        would let herself be induced to do such a thing!",
                "The Editor. Evil communications corrupt good manners! You are a mere\n        bungler in delicate matters, Evje. You made a bad choice in that\n        quarter!",
                "Evje. But he seemed to be --",
                "The Editor. Yes, yes, I know! A real gentleman would have guessed what\n        he would develop into. He has a brother, you know! (HARALD and GERTRUD\n        come in slowly, arm-in-arm.)",
                "Gertrud. While your brother has been ill you have received many\n        gratifying proofs of the good feeling and goodwill that there is in this\n        town-haven't you?",
                "Harald. Yes, I have. I have found no ill-will against him, nothing but\n        kindness on all sides -- with the exception of one person, of course.",
                "Gertrud. But even he has a heart! It has often seemed to me as if I\n        heard a cry of yearning and disappointment from it -- and that just\n        when he spoke most bitterly.",
                "Harald. Yes, it needs no very sharp sight to see that he, who makes so\n        many unhappy, is himself the unhappiest of all.",
                "The Editor. What the deuce are they talking about?",
                "Evje. We cannot hear from here. And the fog deadens their voices.",
                "The Editor. Go a bit nearer, then!",
                "Evje. Not before they separate. You only understand him!",
                "Harald (to GERTRUD). What are you holding there?",
                "Gertrud (who has taken off her glove and then a ring from her finger).\n        The ring they gave me when I was confirmed. Give me your hand! No, take\n        your glove off!",
                "Harald. Do you want me to try your ring on? I shall not be able to get\n        it on.",
                "Gertrud. On the little finger of your left hand? Yes!",
                "Harald (putting it on). So I can. Well?",
                "Gertrud. You mustn't laugh at me. I have been beating up my courage to\n        do this all this time. It was really why I wanted to walk a little\n        farther with you first! I wanted to bring the conversation round to it,\n        you see! I am so convinced that your happiness, and consequently mine,\n        depends on your being able to be kind. You have got this meeting before\n        you to-night. It will be a decisive moment for you. If you, when you are\n        facing all this horrible persecution, can be a kind boy, you will win\n        all along the line! (Pulls at his buttons in an embarrassed way.) So I\n        wanted you to wear this ring to remind you. The diamonds in it sparkle;\n        they are like my tears when you are hard and forget us two. I know it is\n        stupid of me (wipes her eyes hastily), but now, when it comes to the\n        point, I can't say what I -- . But do wear it!",
                "Harald (kissing her). I will wear it! (Gently.) Its pure rays shall shed\n        a light on my life.",
                "Gertrud. Thank you! (Throws her arms round him and kisses him.)",
                "The Editor. What they are doing now is all right! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Evje. I won't stand it! (The EDITOR coughs loudly.) What are you doing?\n        (The EDITOR goes to the neighbouring house and rings the bell. The door\n        is opened and he goes in, laughing as he goes.)",
                "Gertrud (who has started from HARALD'S arms at the sound of the cough).\n        That is -- !",
                "Harald. It sounds like him! (Turns, and sees Evje.)",
                "Gertrud. Father! (Turns to run away, but stops.) No, it is cowardly to\n        run away. (Comes back, and stands at HARALD'S side. EVJE comes forward.)",
                "Evje. I should not have expected my daughter, a well-brought-up girl, to\n        make an assignation in the street with -- with --",
                "Gertrud. With her fianc\u00e9.",
                "Evje. -- with a man who has made a mock of her father and mother, and\n        of his own doing has banished himself from our house.",
                "Harald. From your house, certainly; but not from my future wife.",
                "Evje. A nice explanation! Do you suppose we will consent to have as our\n        son-in-law a man who spurns her parents?",
                "Gertrud. Father!",
                "Evje. Be quiet, my child! You ought to have felt that yourself.",
                "Gertrud. But, father, you surely do not expect him to submit to your\n        being abused and himself ill-treated in our house?",
                "Evje. Are you going to teach your parents -- ?",
                "Gertrud (putting her arm round his neck). I don't want to teach you\n        anything; because you know yourself, dear, that Harald is worth far more -- and\n        far more to us -- than the man who went away just now! (At this\n        moment the printer's boy, who has come out of the EDITOR'S house, runs\n        past them towards the town.)",
                "Evje (seeing the boy, tries to get away). Go in now, Gertrud! I have\n        something I wish to talk to Mr. Rejn about.",
                "Gertrud. You have nothing to talk to Harald about that I cannot hear.",
                "Evje. Yes, I have.",
                "Harald. But why may she not hear it? What you want is to break off our\n        engagement.",
                "Gertrud. Father -- ! (Moves away from him.) Is that true?",
                "Evje. Well-since it cannot be otherwise-it is true; that is to say, for\n        the moment. (Aside.) Good Lord, they can make it up right enough when\n        this is all over!",
                "Gertrud (who is standing as if thunderstruck). I saw you with him! -- Ah!\n        that is how it is! (Looks at her father, bursts into tears and rushes to\n        the door of their house, pulls the bell and disappears into the house.)",
                "Evje. What is it? What is the matter with her?",
                "Harald. I think I know. She realises that her life's happiness has been\n        bought and sold. (Bows to EVJE.) Good-bye! (Goes out to the right.)",
                "Evje (after standing dumb for some moments). Bought and sold? Some\n        people take everything so dreadfully solemnly. It is only a manoeuvre -- to\n        get out of this difficulty. Why is it that I cannot get free of it! They\n        both of them exaggerate matters so absurdly; first of all this crazy\n        fellow, and then Harald with his \"Good-bye,\" spoken as if the ground\n        were giving way beneath his feet! I -- I -- feel as if every one\n        had deserted me. I will go in to my wife -- my dear, good wife; she\n        will understand me. She is sitting up there, full of anxiety about me.\n        (He turns towards his house; but, on reaching the garden gate, sees JOHN\n        standing there.)",
                "John (touching his hat respectfully). Excuse me, Mr. Evje --",
                "Evje. You, John! Go away! I told you never to set foot in my house\n        again.",
                "John (very respectfully). But won't you allow me to stand outside your\n        house either, sir?",
                "Evje. No!",
                "John (standing in EVJE'S way, but still with a show of great respect).\n        Not at the door here?",
                "Evje. What are you standing in my way for, you scoundrel?",
                "John. Shall I assist you to call for help, sir? (Calls out.) Help!",
                "Evje. Be quiet, you drunken fool! Don't make a disturbance! What do you\n        want? Be quick!",
                "John. I want, with all respect, to ask you, sir, why you have sent me\n        away.",
                "Evje. Because you are a swine that gets drunk and then talks nonsense.\n        You don't know what a dilemma you have put me in. -- Now go away from\n        here, quietly!",
                "John. I know all about it! I was following you and the Editor all the\n        time, you know!",
                "Evje. What?",
                "John. These articles, that were to go in the paper -- the printing\n        was at a standstill, waiting for them.",
                "Evje. Hush, hush, John! So you overheard that, did you? You are too\n        clever; you ought never to have been a servant. -- Now, be off with\n        you! Here is a shilling or two for you. Good-bye.",
                "John. Thank you very much, sir. -- This was how it was, sir. You see,\n        I thought of the number of times I had run over to the printer's with\n        messages when that nice Editor gentleman was spending an evening with\n        you -- and so I thought I might just as well run over with this one.",
                "Evje (starting back in alarm). What? What have you done?",
                "John. Just to do you a good turn, sir, I ran along and told them they\n        might print those articles.",
                "Evje. What articles?",
                "John. The ones about you, sir. \"Print away,\" I said -- and they\n        printed away. By Jove, how they worked, and then off to the post with\n        the papers!",
                "Evje. You had the impudence, you -- ! Ah, it's not true! I saw the\n        printer's boy myself, running to the office to countermand the\n        instructions.",
                "John. I caught him up outside here and told him that a message had been\n        sent from Mr. Evje's house. And I gave him sixpence to go to the theatre\n        with; but he must have had to run for it, to be in time, because I am\n        sure it was after seven. Excuse me, sir, but it is after seven\n        now, isn't it?",
                "Evje. You scoundrel! You vindictive brute!",
                "John. You can have a look at the paper, sir, if you like.",
                "Evje. Have you got a copy?",
                "John. Yes, sir, the first copy struck off is always sent to the Editor,\n        so I volunteered to bring it to him. But you must be anxious to see it,\n        sir! (Holds it out to EVJE.)",
                "Evje (snatching it from him). Give it to me! Let me see -- . (Moves\n        towards his door, but stops.) No, my wife mustn't -- . Here, under\n        the gas-lamp! This filthy fog! I can't -- . (Feels in his pocket for\n        his glasses, and pasts them on.) Ah, that's better! (Holds the paper\n        under the light.) What a mischance! The blackguard -- ! Where is the\n        article, then? Oh, here -- I can't see properly, my heart is beating\n        so!",
                "John. Shall I run for the doctor, sir?",
                "Evje. Will you go away, you -- ! (Holds the paper first up, and then\n        down, in his attempts to see better.) Ah, here it is! \"The Stock\n        Exchange Committee\" -- oh! (Lowers the paper.)",
                "John (mimicking him). Oh!",
                "Evje (trying to read). What a vile thing to do!",

                "Evje (wiping his forehead). What a different thing it is to read\n        libellous attacks on others -- and on one's self! (Goes on reading.)\n        Oh! Oh! What horrible, revolting rascality! What is it he says here? I\n        must read through it again! Oh, oh!",
                "John. And often of a morning, when you have been reading the paper, I\n        have heard you laughing till the bed shook under you!",
                "Evje. Yes, I who have so often laughed at others! (Reads.) No, this is\n        beyond belief! I can't read any more! This will ruin my position in the\n        town; I can hear every one laughing at me -- he knows all my\n        weaknesses, and has managed to make it all so hideously ludicrous!\n        (Tries to go on reading.) Why, here is some more! (Reads.) It begins\n        even worse than the other! (Lowers the paper, panting, then tries to go\n        on reading.) No, I can't -- I can't! I must wait! Everything seems\n        going round and round -- and my heart is beating so violently that I\n        know I shall have one of my attacks! What a devil it is that I have been\n        making a friend of! What a creature to have broken bread with! -- an\n        unprincipled scoundrel! And the disgrace of it! -- the disgrace! What\n        will they say at the Exchange? What will -- ? I shall not dare to go\n        out of my house, at least for some weeks! And then people will only say\n        I have taken to my bed! Oh, oh! I feel as if it were the end of\n        everything!",

I will go and ring his bell, and go into his house and call\n        him a scoundrel and spit in his face -- ! Did I bring my stick out\n        with me? Where is my stick? I will send my man for it, and then I will\n        thrash him round and round his own room!",

I must do him some injury -- some real injury\n        that will seem to poison his food for him and rob him of his rest.\n        Scoundrels like that don't deserve sleep! It must be something, too,\n        that will make his family every bit as unhappy as mine will be when they\n        have read this -- something that will make them hide their heads for\n        shame -- something that will make them terrified every time their\n        door-bell rings, out of shame for what their servants may hear! No, no,\n        I am getting as evil-minded as he is, now! -- What a horrible trade -- for\n        ever sowing the seeds of sin and reaping a crop of curses!

And Gertrud,\n        our good Gertrud -- ah, at all events I can give her some pleasure at\n        once.

This has been a bit of luck, for me; but you shall have some\n        more of it! (Disappears into the fog as EVJE goes into his house.

There is a table\n        in the background, and another near the sofa. A lamp is hanging from the\n        ceiling, and another standing on the table at the back. HAAKON REJN, his\n        dress proclaiming him to be a well-to-do yeoman farmer, is sitting on a\n        chair by the sofa.)",
                "Halvdan. So she couldn't come?",
                "Haakon. No; there are the youngsters, you know -- she finds it\n        difficult to get away.",
                "Halvdan (after a moment's silence). Remember to thank her for all her\n        kindness to me. The happiest moments of my life have been those Sundays\n        and evenings that she and you and I spent together at your house. (A\n        pause.)",
                "Haakon. She wanted very much to know how you were feeling -- whether\n        you, who have suffered so much, are at peace now.",
                "Halvdan. At peace? A man who has to die with all his work unfinished,\n        cannot easily root out all thoughts of that from his heart.",
                "Haakon. You should try to lay in God's hands all that you have striven\n        for.",
                "Halvdan. That is what I struggle daily to do. (A pause.)",
                "Haakon. A sister of my wife's, who was a widow and badly off, died\n        leaving three young children. But she was glad to die. \"Their Heavenly\n        Father will help them better when I am out of the way,\" she said. \"I\n        took up too much room,\" she said; \"I know I have often stood in their\n        way.\" (A pause.)",
                "Halvdan. You tell that just as your wife would; she told me that story\n        once.",
                "Haakon. I was to tell you from her that she believes you are to die in\n        order that what you have worked for may come to its fullest fruit. She\n        thinks that when you are gone, people will appreciate better what your\n        aims were.",
                "Halvdan. There is some comfort in the thought that I may be dying in\n        order that what I have loved may live. I have already given up\n        happiness-even honour-for it; I gladly give my life for it now. (A\n        pause.)",
                "Haakon. Do you bear ill-will to any of those who have opposed you so\n        cruelly?",
                "Halvdan. To no one.",
                "Haakon. Not even to those whose doing it is that you are lying here?",

                "Haakon. Then you have not done with it all yet.",
                "Halvdan. No, I know I have not. It is only sometimes that the busy world\n        outside seems to me like a ship sailing idly before the wind. More\n        often, I am back in the midst of it again -- planning, hoping,\n        praying! I am young, you know, and have had to suffer so much -- there\n        was so much I wanted to do. (Lifts a handkerchief to his forehead.\n        HAAKON helps him to wipe his face with it. A pause.)",
                "Haakon. But it must be a comfort to you, too, that Harald is taking up\n        what you are laying down. There is good stuff in him.",
                "Halvdan. Yes.",
                "Haakon. And he never says more than is necessary. The country folk will\n        understand him all the better for it.",
                "Halvdan. I hope so. As soon as he comes into my room I feel as if the\n        atmosphere were charged with electricity -- I feel as if I must\n        have a part in what he is doing -- and so I work, and tire myself\n        out. Ah, it often seems very hard to have to die, and leave undone a\n        great work that one has failed to accomplish!",
                "Haakon. But you have made him what he is, you know -- and many\n        others.",
                "Halvdan. I have started the fight, that is all. It is hard to have to\n        desert at the beginning of it! -- But God is good, and will\n        understand; He will not be surprised at what my thoughts are full of,\n        when I go to Him. (A ring is heard at the bell.)",
                "Haakon. I expect that is Harald.",
                "Halvdan. No, he never rings. Besides, I expect he is taking a walk, to\n        think over what he is going to say to-night.",
                "Haakon. Yes, I suppose it will be a big meeting. (The HOUSEKEEPER comes\n        in.)",
                "The Housekeeper. Mr. Evje is here, sir, asking for Mr. Harald. I told\n        him we were expecting him every moment. Shall I ask him to come in?",
                "Halvdan. Yes, show him in. (HAAKON gets up, as EVJE is shown in.)",
                "Evje (to HALVDAN). Good evening! (Sees HAAKON.) Ah, good evening! So you\n        have come? That is splendid. Is your wife with you?",
                "Haakon. No, she couldn't leave the children.",
                "Evje. I see. (To HALVDAN.) And how are you? About the same? Of course,\n        yes. -- Where is your brother?",
                "Halvdan. He has his meeting to-night, you know.",
                "Evje. His momentous meeting -- I know! I am going to it myself!",
                "Halvdan (turns his face towards him). You?",
                "Evje. My object in coming here was to take him home with me, so that we\n        could all go together to the meeting. We mean to go on to the platform\n        with him; I mean people to see that we are with him!",
                "Halvdan (turning his face away). Really!",
                "Evje (to HAAKON). You never answered my letter, Mr. Rejn.",
                "Haakon. No, I knew I was coming in to town.",
                "Evje. Well -- will you sell?",
                "Haakon. No.",
                "Evje. But, my dear Mr. Rejn, you have not sold a single potato to my\n        distillery for five years! And with a farm like yours! This year you had\n        the best crop in the whole valley.",
                "Haakon. Oh, yes -- it wasn't so bad.",
                "Evje. Not so bad! It was an extraordinary crop; and, everywhere else\n        round about, the crops were very middling.",
                "Haakon. Oh, yes -- it might have been worse.",
                "Evje (laughing). I should think so! But then why won't you sell? (Turns\n        to HALVDAN.) I hope you will excuse our talking business in a sick-room;\n        a business man has to seize every opportunity, you know! (To HAAKON.)\n        You have never got higher prices elsewhere than you have from me.",
                "Haakon. No, so I believe; but I have my own reasons.",
                "Evje. Your own reasons? What are they?",
                "Haakon. I had a servant once -- it is about five years ago now -- a\n        good, capable fellow. He used to take potatoes for me to the distillery\n        every day, and every evening came back drunk. So I spoke to him\n        seriously about it; and his answer was: \"How do you suppose our\n        brandy-merchants are to grow rich, if chaps like me don't drink pretty\n        hard?\" You know the man; he went into your service afterwards. But from\n        that day I have never sold a potato to a distillery.",
                "Evje. But, my dear Mr. Rejn, we cannot be held responsible for the use\n        to which such rascals put God's gifts!",
                "Haakon. No -- no -- I suppose not; still, I am not going to have\n        anything more to do with it.",
                "Evje (to HALVDAN). Do you think your brother will not be home before the\n        meeting?",
                "Halvdan. I should think he would; there is plenty of time yet.",
                "Evje. There is; but I should have liked to take him home with me first.\n        The fact is (laughs) I have promised my wife and daughter not to go home\n        without him. You know what women are! Shall I just go into his room and\n        wait for him? There is something I want to talk to him about, you know.",
                "Halvdan. I don't think there is a fire in there.",
                "Evje. Oh, well, never mind -- I will sit here. I have got a newspaper\n        to read, and you two must go on with your talk just as if I were not\n        here! I shall hear nothing, because I have something to read that\n        interests me. (He pulls a chair up to the table on the right with its\n        back to HALVDAN. HAAKON brings the lamp from the table at the back.) Ah,\n        thank you very much! Now, just talk away as if I were not here! (Takes\n        the paper from his pocket and sits down.)",
                "Haakon (sitting down again beside his brother). I should have liked to\n        go to the meeting, too.",
                "Halvdan. Of course you must go! You will hear Harald tell them how each\n        nation has its own appointed task in the world; that is why it is\n        a nation. But, as long as it does not realise the fact, its politics\n        will be nothing but wrangling between the various class-interests -- a\n        haphazard struggle for power. Our nation has never got beyond that\n        point! I have shouted myself to death over what is a mere market.",
                "Evje (to himself, striking the table with his fist). The whole\n        commercial community is insulted in this insult to me! I will stir them\n        up at the meeting, and insist on our taking our revenge in common!",
                "Haakon. I don't think things will be any better until we are better\n        Christians. Men think of nothing nowadays but themselves and their\n        position.",
                "Evje (to himself). No, no-that wouldn't do. What would people say? They\n        would only say I was badly hit by this.",
                "Halvdan (half to himself). A Christian nation, thinking of nothing but\n        its own interests -- that is to say, power! Equality and Liberty have\n        no meaning for it. Haakon, it surely will be bliss for a wounded soul to\n        be taken into the Everlasting Love, high above all this so-called\n        Christianity of the world! For my soul is sorely wounded!",
                "Evje (to himself ). If only I could strike him dead!",
                "Halvdan. But may they all be forgiven! -- You asked just now whether\n        I could bear to read something hateful about myself to-day. I think I\n        could.",
                "Haakon. Then I can tell you the other message she gave me for you. I\n        have been a little shy of telling you that. It was that you should\n        remember that you must do more than forgive; you must pray for them. (A\n        pause.)",
                "Halvdan (with his hand over his eyes). I do.",
                "Evje (crumpling up the paper and throwing it on the floor). No, I won't\n        stand it! If the blackguard -- . (Gets up in alarm, as he realises\n        what he has done, and is just going to pick up the paper; but at that\n        moment turns round facing the others, and lets it lie.) No, I won't\n        touch it again -- never, as long as I live! (To the others.) You must\n        forgive me, but I was reading something that upset me very much. Your\n        brother will tell you all about it in the morning, no doubt. Poof -- it\n        is very warm in here! But, of course, that is natural in a sick-room. I\n        don't think he can be coming now. I think, too, that I will go on, so as\n        not to be late for the meeting; there is sure to be a difficulty in\n        getting seats. I will get him to go home with me after the meeting,\n        instead. That will be better, after all.",
                "Haakon. I was thinking of going to the meeting. Would you mind if I went\n        with you? -- for I do not know the way myself.",
                "Evje. You will come with me, Mr. Rejn? (To himself.) That will be\n        splendid -- to make my entrance in the company of one of our yeomen\n        farmers! (Aloud.) By all means let us go together! I feel flattered by\n        the opportunity, because I have always maintained that our yeomen are\n        the pick of the nation. Well, then -- (to Halvdan) I hope you will\n        soon be feeling better, Mr. Rejn. God bless you!",
                "Halvdan (raising himself on his elbow, and looking at him with a smile).\n        Something must have gone amiss with you to-day.",
                "Evje. Why do you say that?",
                "Halvdan. Because as a rule you appear so composed so aloof from all this\n        squabbling.",
                "Evje (impetuously). But, do what I like, I am not allowed to keep aloof\n        from it! I have no greater wish in the world than to do so, I can assure\n        you. Oh, well, your excellent brother -- my future son-in-law, as I\n        am proud to call him -- he will tell you all about it. Good-bye! -- and -- and -- God\n        bless you!",
                "Haakon. Shall I tell your housekeeper to come to you?",
                "Halvdan. Oh, no; but you might tell her to come in a little while.",
                "Haakon. Good-bye for the present, then!",
                "Halvdan. Thank you for coming! Good-bye. (Sinks back on to the sofa. The\n        others go out, HAAKON turning round once at the door.)",
                "Halvdan. It is something in the paper that has disturbed his equanimity.\n        What can it be? The same thing that made Harald so gloomy to-day, I\n        wonder? (Gets half up.) It is lying there. -- No! What interest have\n        I in all their petty spite now? (Sinks back again.) \"Could you bear to\n        read something hateful about yourself to-day?\" Haakon asked. Then I\n        suppose there is something about me in it to-day. (Puts his hand over\n        his heart.) My heart doesn't seem to be beating any the faster for my\n        knowing that. (Gets half up.) There it lies! (Sinks back again.) No, I\n        am only trying to tempt myself. All the same, I should like to know how\n        many stations I have passed on my journey to the great City of Peace!\n        Can their malice affect me still? Surely I have passed that\n        station? -- It would be worth trying, to see. There it lies! (Takes\n        up a stick that is standing by the sofa.) Surely I can get over there by\n        myself? (Gets up from the sofa with the help of the stick, and smiles.)\n        I have not much strength left. (Takes a few steps.) Scarcely enough to\n        get across the floor. (A few more steps.) To think that I should have -- so\n        much vanity -- my weak point -- . (His breath fails him, but he\n        gets as far as the chair on which EVJE was sitting, and sits down.) One\n        ought to have done with all that before the soul can get quite away from\n        the dust that -- . (Begins to rake the paper towards him with his\n        stick.) And here am I, sitting here raking more of it towards me! -- No,\n        let the thing lie! I won't soil my wings any more. -- Poor Harald! He\n        has to take up the burden now! What a horrible bungle it is, that we\n        should be brought into the world to give each other as much pain as\n        possible! (Decidedly.) Well, I am going to see what legacy of\n        unhappiness I am leaving him! I want to have a vivid impression of the\n        misery I am escaping from. There is a certain comfort even in that.\n        (Bends down and picks up the paper, rests for a moment, and then unfolds\n        the paper.) But this is not to-day's paper; it is dated for to-morrow!\n        How can Evje have got hold of it? Yes, here is the date -- Sunday.\n        \"Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day!\" On that day men's souls\n        should turn to God -- and they offer Him this! It is after\n        reading this that these fine ladies and gentlemen go to church!\n        (Pushes the paper away from him.) Suppose these \"Christians\" were to be\n        brought to judgment one day without warning? -- Let us think of\n        ourselves and not of others! (Lets his eye rest on the paper.) Does that\n        mean me? (Reads.) \"Not yet actually dead, but already canonised by a\n        calculating brother -- .\" (Checks himself.) God forgive them! (Reads\n        on.) \"His teachings will no doubt obtain him a paean of praise, but this\n        will be -- or, at least, so it is to be hoped -- from within the\n        closely locked doors of the state's prisons and houses of correction\" -- (checks\n        himself a little) -- \"for that is whither he leads his followers.\" -- Good\n        God, to think that they can say such things! -- And yet, they said\n        worse things of Him! Peace!

I am too weak still! -- Ah! I\n        feel -- what is it? (Puts his hands suddenly to his heart, still\n        unconsciously grasping the newspaper in them.) I must get into my room -- get\n        to bed! (Gets up with the help of his stick.) If only I can get there!\n        Oh, I feel it coming on! -- I must -- . (Tries to hurry, but when\n        he is halfway across the floor he stumbles, throws out his hands but\n        finds no support, staggers on for a few steps, and falls full length on\n        the threshold of his bedroom, so that half his length lies within the\n        door and half without. A moment later, the HOUSEKEEPER comes in.)",
                "The Housekeeper (not observing that he is not still on the sofa). Won't\n        you go to bed now, sir? You can't stand so much in one day. (Goes to the\n        sofa.) Where is he? Surely he has not tried to walk in alone? (Hurries\n        across to the bedroom door and almost falls over his body. She starts\n        back with a scream.) Where is -- ? (Catches up the lamp, hurries\n        back, and bends over him; then calls out, screaming:) Help! Help! (Rings\n        the bell wildly. A MAID appears.) Mr. Halvdan is lying here! Heaven\n        knows whether he is dead or alive! Run for the Doctor! Leave the door\n        open behind you, and beg the first man you meet in the street to come up\n        here at once and help me. Tell them it is a matter of life and death!",
                "Maid. Yes!",
                "The Housekeeper. Hurry!",

                "The Housekeeper (coming back into the room). Is he alive or dead? I\n        haven't the courage to find out. And both his brothers away!

I can't look at it now; but if it is\n        like the number I read the other day (lets the paper fall, and gets up\n        with the lamp) then I understand everything -- and may God requite\n        those that do such things!

                "The Editor. Is it here?",
                "The Housekeeper (holds the lamp to him, then starts back). What do you\n        want here?",

                "The Housekeeper. And it was you she met? It is the hand of God!",

                "The Editor (from inside the room). I slipped. There is something wet\n        here.",
                "The Housekeeper. Yes, he has had a hemorrhage. Carefully, now. (They\n        carry him in. The stage remains empty for a moment.

(Wipes it with his handkerchief.) And now it is on my\n        handkerchief! (Throws it away.) No, it has my name on it. (Picks it up\n        again.) No one can say it is my fault. (Sits down, then gets up, wiping\n        his forehead with his handkerchief without noticing what he is doing.)\n        Ah, I hope I haven't put blood on my forehead? I seem to feel it there!\n        (Feels with his hand to see if his brow is wet.) No. (Sits down, then\n        gets up again.) Let me get away from here. (Stops.) To think that I\n        should be the one to come up! that it should just happen to-night that I\n        did not receive my paper, and so went out! It almost seems more than\n        accident. Indeed, I often had a foreboding that it would happen. (Stands\n        opposite the bedroom door.) But is he dead? I think I will go and fetch\n        the Doctor. Oh no, of course the maid has gone for him. He hasn't long\n        to live, anyway; I could see that.

I might sneak out of the town? Then they will gloat over me! I won't\n        allow them that pleasure! No, I cannot stay my hand utter a failure;\n        only after a victory. That is the cursed part of it-never, never to be\n        able to end it. Oh, for some one that could end it -- end it, end it!\n        Oh, for one day of real peace! Shall I ever get that? (Sits\n        down.) No, no, I must get away! (Gets up.) To-morrow must take care of\n        itself. (Starts.) There is the paper he was reading! (Steps over it.) I\n        will take it away -- and burn it. (Takes it up.) I cannot burn it\n        here; some one might come. (Is just going to put it into his pocket, as\n        it is, but takes it out again to fold it better.) A Sunday's paper,\n        apparently! Then it is not to-day's? An old number, I suppose.\n        Then the whole thing is a mistake! (Sighs with relief.) Let me look\n        again! (Opens the paper, tremblingly.) I don't deserve it, but -- .\n        (Reads.) Sunday, the -- . To-morrow's paper? Here? How\n        in all the world did it get here? (Appears horrified.) Here are the\n        articles about Evje! How on earth did they get in? Didn't I send a\n        message? Didn't I write? This on the top of everything else! Are even my\n        printers conspiring against me? Well, even if it ruins me, I shall go\n        on! They shall find out what I can do. How on earth can I be expected to\n        help it if a weak-minded fellow dies, or if my printers are drunk or my\n        manager has delirium tremens! I shall pursue my end through all chances\n        and in spite of all their tricks, and I shall crush them, crush them -- I\n        shall -- . (Gives way to a paroxysm of rage. At this moment the MAID\n        comes in with the DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT. The MAID rushes into the bedroom.\n        The EDITOR starts up.) Who is that? What do you want?",

To-night, the meeting -- and Harald Rejn will take them\n        by storm. To-morrow, his brother's death -- and my new article in the\n        paper -- and, in addition to that, those about Evje, who at present\n        is only angry. And the election in two days! Oh, yes, he will be elected\n        now. So I may as well give it all up at once. I would change places with\n        any wolf that has a lair to hide in. Those cold eyes of his!

                "Evje and Mrs. Evje. It was he!",
                "Evje. I fetched him from your brother Halvdan's.",
                "Harald. I am so glad! It must have pleased Haakon. Gertrud and I at\n        first thought of going in to see Halvdan before we came on here; but we\n        saw all his lights were out. He must be asleep.",

                "The Doctor. But we must go ceremoniously! Let us make a little festivity\n        of it to-night! You must head the procession, Evje -- and then the\n        two young people Gertrud (taking HARALD's arm). Yes!",
                "The Doctor. And Mrs. Evje and I will bring up the rear! (Offers her his\n        arm.)",
                "Evje. Forward!(The bell rings. He stops.) Who can it be -- as late as\n        this?",
                "The Doctor. Probably some friends on their way back from the meeting.",

                "The Doctor. They are impatient! So much the better -- it shows they\n        are in a good humour after the meeting! (A knock is heard at the door.)",
                "All. Come in!(The EDITOR comes in, with no overcoat on, but wearing his\n        hat, which he forgets to take of till he is well into the room. He goes\n        straight up to EVJE, who has crossed over to the left-hand side of the\n        room.)",
                "All (when they see him in the doorway). You! (GERTRUD clings closer to\n        HARALD.)",
                "The Editor. I wanted once more, as in the old days, not to go to bed\n        without -- this time it is not a question of thanking you for the\n        happy time we have had together but without begging your pardon!(He\n        speaks quietly, but with suppressed emotion.)There has been some\n        unfortunate misunderstanding.

                "Mrs. Evje. Oh, you have said that so often! Nobody believes it. No; when\n        a man can push political hatred so far as to write about an old friend,\n        in whose house he has been a daily guest, as if he were a criminal -- and\n        all because he doesn't like his son-in-law, or his servant -- one\n        doesn't shake hands with him the very day his attacks appear in the\n        paper.",

Evje, you are a good-hearted fellow, I know.\n        Don't listen to what others say, now. This is a very bitter hour for me.\n        You would be doing a good deed! Give me your hand -- or a word! I am\n        in such a state now that I must have visible signs of some one's\n        forgiveness, or I shall -- !",

You want to\n        learn, just for once, what it is to be wounded at heart. You are only\n        accustomed to deal with people whom you can flog one day and have at\n        your feet -- either from fear or from vanity -- the next. And have\n        we -- God forgive us! -- ever thought seriously the worse of you\n        for it? No; because we never understood what it was till we were hit by\n        it ourselves. But that is all the more reason why we should do our duty\n        now! Hatred shall be met with hatred!",

And as for you, who have often laughed so heartily at my\n        so-called malice, and now all at once have become so severely virtuous -- why,\n        you are both like part-proprietors of my paper! You have taken all the\n        profit you could from me, as long as it served your purpose -- I have\n        seen that for a long time!

No -- it is just through his death that respect\n        for me will revive -- it will be like a rampart of bayonets round me!\n        \"There goes one who can kill a man with a word, if he likes!\" That\n        will make them treat me respectfully!",

                "The Editor (as he hears HARALD'S voice). And you -- you mountebank,\n        who can stand up in public and seek applause before your brother's\n        corpse is cold -- don't come talking rant to me! You are more\n        contemptible than I am! I couldn't have done that; I couldn't stand\n        there, as you are doing now, impatient to get to your champagne and\n        pretty speeches! -- Oh, how I despise all such lying and\n        heartlessness!

As I expect you will\n        be going to your old friends' after the meeting, and will meet Harald\n        Rejn there, the task will probably fall to you of telling him -- (the\n        EDITOR gets up to go, but stands still) -- that Halvdan Rejn died\n        about eight o'clock of a fresh attack of hemorrhage! (HARALD leaves\n        GERTRUD'S side and comes forward, with a cry. The EDITOR steadies\n        himself by holding on to the table.)

                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, and have to be always beside him to interpret! -- But\n        I am no nearer this dinner. And lately I have been finding such\n        difficulty in getting about.",
                "Hamar. I have never in my life heard so much talk about meals as I have\n        in this house.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. You see, you have never been in a prosperous\n        business-man's house before. Our friends are mostly business-men, of\n        course -- and most of them have no greater pleasures than those of\n        the table.",
                "Signe. That's true.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Are you wearing that dress to-day?",
                "Signe. Yes.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. You have worn a different one every day.",
                "Signe. Well, if Hamar is tired of both the blue one and the grey one,\n        what can I do?",
                "Hamar. And I don't like this one any better than the others.",
                "Signe. Indeed! -- Then I really think you had better order me one\n        yourself.",
                "Hamar. Come to town with me, and I will!",
                "Signe. Yes, mother -- Hamar and I have made up our minds that we must\n        go back to town. [Note: There would be nothing contrary to Norwegian\n        ideas of propriety in Signe's proposal. In Norway an engaged couple\n        could travel alone; and the fianc\u00e9e would go to stay in the house of her\n        future husband's relations.]",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. But you were there only a fortnight ago!",
                "Hamar. And it is exactly a fortnight too long since we were there!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. (thoughtfully). Now, what can I order for dinner?",
                "(VALBORG comes into sight on the verandah.)",
                "Signe (turning round and seeing VALBORG). Enter Her Highness!",
                "Hamar (turning round). Carrying a bouquet! Oho! I have seen it before!",
                "Signe. Have you? Did you give it her?",
                "Hamar. No; I was coming through the garden -- and saw it on the table\n        in Valborg's summerhouse. Is it your birthday, Valborg?",
                "Valborg. No.",
                "Hamar. I thought not. Perhaps there is some other festivity to-day?",
                "Valborg. No. (SIGNE suddenly bursts out laughing.)",
                "Hamar. Why do you laugh?",
                "Signe. Because I understand! Ha, ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. What do you understand?",
                "Signe. Whose hands it is that have decked the altar! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. I suppose you think they were mine?",
                "Signe. No, they were redder hands than yours! Ha, ha, ha, ha! (VALBORG\n        throws the bouquet down.) Oh, dear me, it doesn't do to laugh so much in\n        this heat. But it is delightful! To think he should have hit upon that\n        idea! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar (laughing). Do you mean -- ?",
                "Signe (laughing). Yes! You must know that Valborg --",
                "Valborg. Signe!",
                "Signe. -- who has sent so many distinguished suitors about their\n        business, cannot escape from the attentions of a certain red pair of\n        hands -- ha, ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. Do you mean Sannaes?",
                "Signe. Yes! (Points out of the window.) There is the culprit! He is\n        waiting, Valborg, for you to come, in maiden meditation, with the\n        bouquet in your hands -- as you came just now --",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. (getting up). No, it is your father he is waiting for. Ah,\n        he sees him now. (Goes out by the verandah.)",
                "Signe. Yes, it really is father -- riding a bay horse!",
                "Hamar (getting up). On a bay horse! Let us go and say \"how do you do\" to\n        the bay horse!",
                "Signe. N -- o, no!",
                "Hamar. You won't come and say \"how do you do\" to the bay horse? A\n        cavalry officer's wife must love horses next best to her husband.",
                "Signe. And he his wife next best to his horses.",
                "Hamar. What? Are you jealous of a horse?",
                "Signe. Oh, I know very well you have never been so fond of me as you are\n        of horses.",
                "Hamar. Come along! (Pulls her up out of her chair.)",
                "Signe. But I don't feel the least interested in the bay horse.",
                "Hamar. Very well, then, I will go alone!",
                "Signe. No, I will come.",
                "Hamar (to VALBORG). Won't you come and welcome the bay horse too?",
                "Valborg. No, but I will go and welcome my father!",
                "Signe (looking back, as she goes). Yes, of course -- father as well.\n        (She and HAMAR go out.)",
                "(VALBORG goes to the farthest window and stands looking out of it. Her\n        dress is the same colour as the long curtain, and a piece of statuary\n        and some flowers conceal her from any one entering the room. SANNAES\n        comes in, carrying a small saddle-bag and a cloak, which he puts down on\n        a chair behind the door. As he turns round he sees the bouquet on the\n        door.)",
                "Sannaes. There it is! Has she dropped it by accident, or did she throw\n        it down? Never mind -- she has had it in her hands. (Picks it up,\n        kisses it, and is going to take it away.)",
                "Valborg (coming forward). Leave it alone!",
                "Sannaes (dropping the bouquet). You here, Miss Valborg -- ? I didn't\n        see you --",
                "Valborg. But I can see what you are after. How dare you presume to think\n        of persecuting me with your flowers and your -- your red hands? (He\n        puts his hands behind his back.) How dare you make me a laughing-stock\n        to every one in the house, and I suppose to every one in the town?",
                "Sannaes. I -- I -- I --",
                "Valborg. And what about me? Don't you think I deserve a little\n        consideration? You will be turned out of the house before long, if you\n        do not take care -- ! Now be quick and get away before the others\n        come in. (SANNAES turns away, holding his hands in front of him, and\n        goes out by the verandah to the right. At the same moment TJAELDE is\n        seen coming at the other end of the verandah, followed by HAMAR and\n        SIGNE.)",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, it is a fine horse.",
                "Hamar. Fine? I don't believe there is its equal in the country.",
                "Tjaelde. I dare say. Did you notice that he hadn't turned a hair?",
                "Hamar. What glorious lungs! And such a beauty, too -- his head, his\n        legs, his neck -- ! I never saw such a beauty!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, he is a handsome beast. (Looks out of the verandah at the\n        yacht.) Have you been out for a sail?",
                "Hamar. I was sailing among the islands last night, and came back this\n        morning with the fishing-boats -- a delightful sail!",
                "Tjaelde. I wish I had time to do that.",
                "Hamar. But surely it is only imagination on your part, to think that you\n        never have time?",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, well, perhaps I have time but not inclination.",
                "Signe. And how do things stand where you have been?",
                "Tjaelde. Badly.",
                "Valborg (coming forward). Welcome home, father!",
                "Tjaelde. Thank you, dear!",
                "Hamar. Is it not possible to save anything?",
                "Tjaelde. Not at present; that is why I took the horse.",
                "Hamar. Then the bay horse is the only thing you get out of the smash?",
                "Tjaelde. Do you know that I might say that horse has cost me three or\n        four thousand pounds?",
                "Hamar. Well, that is its only defect, anyway! Still, if the worst comes\n        to the worst, and you can afford it -- the horse is priceless!\n        (TJAELDE turns away, puts down his hat and coat and takes off his\n        gloves.)",
                "Signe. It is beautiful to see your enthusiasm when you talk about\n        horses. I rather think it is the only enthusiasm you have.",
                "Hamar. Yes, if I were not a cavalry officer I should like to be a horse!",
                "Signe. Thank you! And what should I be?",
                "Valborg. \"Oh, were I but the saddle on thy back! Oh, were I but the whip\n        about thy loins!\"",
                "Hamar. \"Oh, were I but the flowers in thy -- .\" No, \"hand\" doesn't\n        rhyme!",
                "Tjaelde. (coming forward, meets MRS. TJAELDE, who has come in from the\n        right.) Well, my dear, how are you?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Oh, I find it more and more difficult to get about.",
                "Tjaelde. There is always something the matter with you, my dear! Can I\n        have something to eat?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, it has been standing waiting for you. Here it comes.\n        (A maid brings in a tray which she lays on the table.)",
                "Tjaelde. Good!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Will you have a cup of tea?",
                "Tjaelde. No, thank you.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. (sitting down beside him and pouring him out a glass of\n        wine). And how have things gone with the M\u00f6llers?",
                "Tjaelde. Badly. I told you so already.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. I didn't hear you.",
                "Valborg. I had a letter to-day from Nanna M\u00f6ller. She tells me all about\n        it -- how none of the family knew anything about it till the officers\n        of the courts came.",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, there must have been a dreadful scene.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Did he tell you anything about it?",
                "Tjaelde (as he eats). I didn't speak to him.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. My dear! Why, you are old friends!",
                "Tjaelde. Bah! Old friends! He sat looking as if he had taken leave of\n        his senses. Besides, I have had enough of that family. I didn't go there\n        to hear them talk about their troubles.",
                "Signe. I suppose it was all very sad?",
                "Tjaelde (still eating). Shocking!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What will they have to live on?",
                "Tjaelde. What is allowed them by their creditors, of course.",
                "Signe. But all the things they had?",
                "Tjaelde. Sold.",
                "Signe. All those pretty things -- their furniture, their carriages,\n        their -- ?",
                "Tjaelde. All sold.",
                "Hamar. And his watch? It is the most beautiful watch I have ever seen -- next\n        to yours.",
                "Tjaelde. It had to go, of course, being jewellery. Give me some wine; I\n        am hot and thirsty.",
                "Signe. Poor things!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Where are they going to live now?",
                "Tjaelde. In the house of one of the skippers of what was their fleet.\n        Two small rooms and a kitchen.",
                "Signe. Two small rooms and a kitchen! (A pause.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What do they intend to do?",
                "Tjaelde. There was a subscription started to enable Mrs. M\u00f6ller to get\n        the job of catering for the Club.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Is the poor woman going to have more cooking to do!",
                "Signe. Did they send no messages to us?",
                "Tjaelde. Of course they did; but I didn't pay any attention to them.",
                "Hamar (who has been standing on the verandah). But M\u00f6ller -- what did\n        he say? What did he do?",
                "Tjaelde. I don't know, I tell you.",
                "Valborg (who has been walking up and down the room during the preceding\n        conversation). He has said and done quite enough already.",
                "Tjaelde (who has at last finished eating and drinking, is struck by her\n        words). What do you mean by that, Valborg?",
                "Valborg. That if I were his daughter I would never forgive him.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. My dear Valborg, don't say such things!",
                "Valborg. I mean it! A man who would bring such shame and misery upon his\n        family does not deserve any mercy from them.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. We are all in need of mercy.",
                "Valborg. In one sense, yes. But what I mean is that I could never give\n        him my respect or my affection again. He would have wronged me too\n        cruelly.",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Wronged you?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Have you finished already, dear?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. No more wine?",
                "Tjaelde. I said I had finished. Wronged you? How?",
                "Valborg. Well, I cannot imagine how one could be more cruelly wronged\n        than to be allowed to assume a position that was nothing but a lie, to\n        live up to means that had no real existence but were merely a sham -- one's\n        clothes a lie, one's very existence a lie! Suppose I were the sort of\n        girl that found a certain delight in making use of her position as a\n        rich man's daughter -- in using it to the fullest possible extent;\n        well, when I discovered that all that my father had given me was\n        stolen-that all he had made me believe in was a lie -- I am sure that\n        then my anger and my shame would be beyond all bounds!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. My child, you have never been tried. You don't know how\n        such things may happen. You don't really know what you are saying!",
                "Hamar. Well it might do M\u00f6ller good if he heard what she says!",
                "Valborg. He has heard it. His daughter said that to him.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. His own daughter! Child, child, is that what you write to\n        each other about? God forgive you both!",
                "Valborg. Oh, He will forgive us, because we speak the truth.",
                "Mrs. Tialde. Child, child!",
                "Tjaelde. You evidently don't understand what business is -- success\n        one day and failure the next.",
                "Valborg. No one will ever persuade me that business is a lottery.",
                "Tjaelde. No, a sound business is not.",
                "Valborg. Exactly. It is the unsound sort that I condemn.",
                "Tjaelde. Still, even the soundest have their anxious moments.",
                "Valborg. If the anxious moments really foreshadow a crisis, no man of\n        honour would keep his family o: his creditors in ignorance of the fact.\n        My God, how Mr. M\u00f6ller has deceived his!",
                "Signe. Valborg is always talking about business!",
                "Valborg. Yes, it has had an attraction for me ever since I was a child.\n        I am not ashamed of that.",
                "Signe. You think you know all about it, anyway.",
                "Valborg. Oh, no; but you can easily get to know a little about anything\n        you are fond of.",
                "Hamar. And one would need no great knowledge of business to condemn the\n        way M\u00f6ller went on. It was obvious to every one. And the way his family\n        went on, too! Who went the pace as much as the M\u00f6llers? Think of his\n        daughter's toilettes!",
                "Valborg. His daughter is my best friend. I don't want to hear her\n        abused.",
                "Hamar. Your Highness will admit that it is possible to be the daughter\n        of a very rich man without being as proud and as vain as -- as\n        the lady I am not allowed to mention!",
                "Valborg. Nanna is neither proud nor vain. She is absolutely genuine. She\n        had the aptitude for being exactly what she thought she was -- a rich\n        man's daughter.",
                "Hamar. Has she the \"aptitude\" for being a bankrupt's daughter now?",
                "Valborg. Certainly. She has sold all her trinkets, her dresses -- every\n        single thing she had. What she wears, she has either paid for herself or\n        obtained by promising future payment.",
                "Hamar. May I ask if she kept her stockings?",
                "Valborg. She sent everything to a sale.",
                "Hamar. If I had known that I would certainly have attended it!",
                "Valborg. Yes, I daresay there was plenty to make fun of, and plenty of\n        idle loafers, too, who were not ashamed to do so.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Children, children!",
                "Hamar. May I ask if Miss Nanna sent her own idleness to the sale with\n        her other effects? -- because I have never known any one with a finer\n        supply of it!",
                "Valborg. She never thought she would need to work.",
                "Tjaelde (coming forward to VALBORG). To take up the thread of what we\n        were saying: you don't understand what a business-man's hope is from one\n        day to the other -- always a renewed hope. That fact does not make\n        him a swindler. He may be unduly sanguine, perhaps -- a poet, if you\n        like, who lives in a world of dreams -- or he may be a real genius,\n        who sees land ahead when no one else suspects it.",
                "Valborg. I don't think I misunderstand the real state of affairs. But\n        perhaps you do, father. Because is not what you call hope, poetry,\n        genius, merely speculating with what belongs to others, when a man knows\n        that he owes more than he has got?",
                "Tjaelde. It may be very difficult to be certain even whether he does\n        that or not.",
                "Valborg. Really? I should have thought his books would tell him --",
                "Tjaelde. About his assets and his liabilities, certainly. But values are\n        fluctuating things; and he may always have in hand some venture which,\n        though it cannot be specified, may alter the whole situation.",
                "Valborg. If he undeniably owes more than he possesses, any venture he\n        undertakes must be a speculation with other people's money.",
                "Tjaelde. Well -- perhaps that is so; but that does not mean that he\n        steals the money -- he only uses it in trust for them.",
                "Valborg. Entrusted to him on the false supposition that he is solvent.",
                "Tjaelde. But possibly that money may save the whole situation.",
                "Valborg. That does not alter the fact that he has got the use of it by a\n        lie.",
                "Tjaelde. You use very harsh terms. (MRS. TJAELDE has once or twice been\n        making signs to VALBORG, which the latter sees but pays no attention\n        to.)",
                "Valborg. In that case the lie consists in the concealment.",
                "Tjaelde. But what do you want him to do? To lay all his cards on the\n        table, and so ruin both himself and the others?",
                "Valborg. Yes, he ought to take every one concerned into his confidence.",
                "Tjaelde. Bah! In that case we should see a thousand failures every year,\n        and fortunes lost one after the other everywhere! No, you have a level\n        head, Valborg, but your ideas are narrow. Look here, where are the\n        newspapers? (SIGNE, who has been talking confidentially to HAMAR on the\n        verandah, comes forward.)",
                "Signe. I took them down to your office. I did not know you meant to stay\n        in here.",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, bother the office! Please fetch them for me. (SIGNE goes\n        out, followed by Hamar.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (in an undertone to VALBORG). Why will you never listen to\n        your mother, Valborg? (VALBORG goes out to the verandah; leans on the\n        edge of it, with her head on her hands, and looks out.)",
                "Tjaelde. I think I will change my coat. Oh no, I will wait till\n        dinner-time.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Dinner! And here I am still sitting here!",
                "Tjaelde. Are we expecting any one?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, have you forgotten?",
                "Tjaelde. Of course, yes.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (going out). What on earth am I to order?",
                "(TJAELDE comes forward as soon as he is alone, sits down on a chair with\n        a weary, harassed expression, and buries his face in his hands with a\n        sigh. SIGNE and HAMAR come back, she carrying some newspapers. HAMAR is\n        going out to the verandah again, but SIGNE pulls him back.)",
                "Signe. Here you are, father. Here are --",
                "Tjaelde. What? Who?",
                "Signe (astonished). The newspapers.",
                "Tjaelde. Ah, yes. Give them to me.(Opens them hurriedly. They are mostly\n        foreign papers, in which he scans the money articles one after another.)",
                "Signe (after a whispered conversation with HAMAR). Father!",
                "Tjaelde (without looking up from the papers).Well? (To himself,\n        gloomily.) Down again, always down!",
                "Signe. Hamar and I want so much to go into town again to Aunt Ulla's.",
                "Tjaelde. But you know you were there only a fortnight ago. I received\n        your bills yesterday. Have you seen them?",
                "Signe. No need for that, father, if you have seen them! Why do\n        you sigh?",
                "Tjaelde. Oh -- because I see that stocks keep falling.",
                "Signe. Pooh! Why should you bother about that? Now you are sighing\n        again. I am sure you know how horrid it is for those you love not to\n        have what they want. You won't be so unkind to us, father?",
                "Tjaelde. No, my child, it can't be done.",
                "Signe. Why?",
                "Tjaelde. Because -- because -- well, because now that it is summer\n        time so many people will be coming here whom we shall have to entertain.",
                "Signe. But entertaining people is the most tiresome thing I know, and\n        Hamar agrees with me.",
                "Tjaelde. Don't you think I have to do tiresome things sometimes, my\n        girl?",
                "Signe. Father dear, why are you talking so solemnly and ceremoniously?\n        It sounds quite funny from you!",
                "Tjaelde. Seriously, my child, it is by no means an unimportant matter\n        for a big business house like ours, with such a wide-spread connection,\n        that people coming here from all quarters should find themselves\n        hospitably received. You might do that much for me.",
                "Signe. Hamar and I will never have a moment alone at that rate.",
                "Tjaelde. I think you mostly squabble when you are alone.",
                "Signe. Squabble? That is a very ugly word, father.",
                "Tjaelde. Besides, you would be no more alone if you were in town.",
                "Signe. Oh, but it is quite different there!",
                "Tjaelde. So I should think -- from the way you throw your money\n        about!",
                "Signe (laughing). Throw our money about! What else have we to do? Isn't\n        that what we are for? Daddy, listen -- dear old dad --",
                "Tjaelde. No, dear -- no.",
                "Signe. You have never been so horrid to me before.",
                "Hamar (who has been making signs to her to stop, whispers). Can't you be\n        quiet! Don't you see he is put out about something?",
                "Signe (whispering). Well, you might have backed me up a little.",
                "Hamar (as before). No, I am a bit wiser than you.",
                "Signe (as before). You have been so odd lately. I am sure I don't know\n        what you want?",
                "Hamar (as before). Oh, well, it doesn't matter now -- because I am\n        going to town alone.",
                "Signe (as before). What are you going to do?",
                "Hamar (going). I am going to town alone. I am sick of this!",
                "Signe (following him). Just you try! (Both go out by the verandah, to\n        the right. TJAELDE lets the newspapers fall out of his hands with a\n        heavy sigh.)",
                "Valborg (looking in from the verandah). Father! (TJAELDE starts.) There\n        goes Mr. Berent, the lawyer from Christiania.",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Berent? Where? On the wharf?",
                "Valborg. Yes. (Comes back into the room. TJAELDE looks out of the\n        window.) The reason I told you was because I saw him yesterday at the\n        timber-yard, and a little while before that, at the brewery and at the\n        works.",
                "Tjaelde (to himself). What can that mean? (Aloud.) Oh, I know he is very\n        fond of making little trips to all sorts of places in the summer. This\n        year he has come here -- and no doubt he likes to see the chief\n        industries of the place. There is not much else here to see! But are you\n        sure it is he? I think --",
                "Valborg (looking out). Yes, it is he. Look now, you know his walk --",
                "Tjaelde. -- and his trick of crossing his feet -- yes, it is he.\n        It looks as if he were coming here.",
                "Valborg. No, he has turned away.",
                "Tjaelde. All the better! (To himself, thoughtfully.) Could it possibly\n        mean -- ? (SANNAES comes in from the right.)",
                "Sannaes. Am I disturbing you, sir?",
                "Tjaelde. Is that you, Sannaes? (SANNAES, as he comes forward, sees\n        VALBORG standing by the farther window. He appears frightened and hides\n        his hands quickly behind his back.) What do you want? (VALBORG looks at\n        SANNAES, then goes on to the verandah and out to the right.) What is it,\n        man? What the deuce are you standing there for?",
                "Sannaes (bringing his hands from behind his back as soon as VALBORG has\n        passed him, and looking after her.) I didn't like to ask you, before\n        Miss Valborg, whether you are coming down to your office to-day or not.",
                "Tjaelde. Have you gone mad? Why on earth shouldn't you ask me that\n        before Miss Valborg?",
                "Sannaes. I mean that -- if not -- I should like to speak to you\n        here, if it is convenient.",
                "Tjaelde. Look here, Sannaes, you ought to try and get rid of your\n        shyness; it doesn't suit a business man. A business man should be smart\n        and active, and not let his wits go wool-gathering because he finds\n        himself in the same room with a woman. I have often noticed it in you. -- Now,\n        what is it? Out with it!",
                "Sannaes. You are not coming to the office this morning, sir?",
                "Tjaelde. No, there is no post goes out before this evening.",
                "Sannaes. No. But there are some bills of exchange --",
                "Tjaelde. Bills? No.",
                "Sannaes. Yes, sir -- that fourth one of M\u00f6ller's that was protested,\n        and the big English one.",
                "Tjaelde (angrily). Have they not been met yet? What does this mean?",
                "Sannaes. The manager of the bank wanted to see you first, sir!",
                "Tjaelde. Have you gone crazy -- ? (Collects himself.) There must be\n        some misunderstanding, Sannaes.",
                "Sannaes. That is what I thought; so I spoke about it to the chief clerk,\n        and to Mr. Holst as well.",
                "Tjaelde. And Mr. Holst said -- ?",
                "Sannaes. The same thing.",
                "Tjaelde (walking up and down). I will go and see him -- or rather, I\n        won't go and see him; because this is evidently something that -- .\n        We have some days' grace yet, haven't we?",
                "Sannaes. Yes, sir.",
                "Tjaelde. And still no telegram from Mr. Lind?",
                "Sannaes. No, sir.",
                "Tjaelde (to himself). I can't understand it. (Aloud.) We will negotiate\n        this matter direct with Christiania, Sannaes. That is what we will do -- and\n        leave these little local banks alone in future. That will do, Sannaes!\n        (Makes a gesture of dismissal. Then says to himself:) That damned\n        M\u00f6ller! It has made them all suspicious! (Turns round and sees SANNAES\n        still there.) What are you waiting for?",
                "Sannaes. It is settling day -- and I have no money in the safe.",
                "Tjaelde. No money in the safe! A big business like this, and nothing in\n        the safe on settling day! What kind of management is that, I should like\n        to know? Must I teach you the A B C of business over and over again? One\n        can never take a half day off, or hand over the control! of the tiniest\n        part of the business -- ! I have no one, absolutely no one, that I\n        can rely on! How have you let things get into such a state?",
                "Sannaes. Well, there was a third bill, which expired to-day -- Holm\n        and Co., for \u00a3400. I had relied upon the bank, unfortunately -- so\n        there was nothing for it but to empty the safe -- here and at the\n        brewery as well.",
                "Tjaelde (walking about restlessly). Hm -- hm -- hm! -- Now, who\n        can have put that into Holst's head? -- Very well, that will do.\n        (Dismisses SANNAES, who goes out but comes back immediately.)",
                "Sannaes (whispering). Here is Mr. Berent!",
                "Tjaelde (surprised). Coming here?",
                "Sannaes. He is just coming up the steps! (Goes out by the further door\n        on the right.)",
                "Tjaelde. (calls after him in a whisper). Send up some wine and cakes! -- It\n        is just as I suspected! (Catches sight of himself in a mirror.) Good\n        Lord, how bad I look! (Turns away painfully from the mirror; looks in it\n        again, forces a smile to his face, and so, smiling, goes towards the\n        verandah, where BERENT is seen coming in slowly from the left.)",
                "Tjaelde (greeting BERENT politely but with reserve). I feel honoured at\n        receiving a visit from so distinguished a man.",
                "Berent. Mr. Tjaelde, I believe?",
                "Tjaelde. At your service! My eldest daughter has just been telling me\n        that she had seen you walking about my property.",
                "Berent. Yes; an extensive property -- and an extensive business.",
                "Tjaelde. Too extensive, Mr. Berent. Too many-sided. But one thing has\n        led to another. Pray sit down.",
                "Berent. Thank you; it is very warm to-day. (A maid brings in cakes and\n        wine, and puts them on the table.)",
                "Tjaelde. Let me give you a glass of wine?",
                "Berent. No, thank you.",
                "Tjaelde. Or something to eat?",
                "Berent. Nothing, thank you.",
                "Tjaelde (taking out his cigar-case). May I offer you a cigar? I can\n        answer for their quality.",
                "Berent. I am very fond of a good cigar. But for the moment I will not\n        take anything, thank you! (A pause. TJAELDE takes a seat.)",
                "Tjaelde (in a quiet, confidential voice). Have you been long here, Mr.\n        Berent?",
                "Berent. Only a day or two. You have been away, have you not?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes -- that unhappy affair of Mr. M\u00f6ller's. A meeting of\n        creditors after the sale.",
                "Berent. Times are hard just now.",
                "Tjaelde. Extraordinarily so!",
                "Berent. Do you think that M\u00f6ller's failure will bring down any more\n        firms with it-besides those we know of already, I mean?",
                "Tjaelde. I don't think so. His -- his misfortune was an exceptional\n        case in every respect.",
                "Berent. It has made the banks a little nervous, I hear.",
                "Tjaelde. I dare say.",
                "Berent. Of course you know the state of affairs here better than any\n        one.",
                "Tjaelde. (with a smile). I am very much indebted to you for your\n        flattering confidence in me.",
                "Berent. I suppose all this might have a bad effect upon the export trade\n        of this part of the country?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes -- it is really hard to tell; but the important thing\n        certainly is to keep every one on their legs.",
                "Berent. That is your opinion?",
                "Tjaelde. Undoubtedly.",
                "Berent. As a general rule a crisis of this sort shows up the unsound\n        elements in a commercial community.",
                "Tjaelde (with a smile). And for that reason this crisis should be\n        allowed to take its natural course, you mean?",
                "Berent. That is my meaning.",
                "Tjaelde. Hm! -- In some places it is possible that the dividing line\n        between the sound firms and the unsound may not be very distinct.",
                "Berent. Can there really be any danger of such a thing here?",
                "Tjaelde. Well -- you are expecting too much of my knowledge of\n        affairs; but I should be inclined to think that there may. (A pause.)",
                "Berent. I have been instructed by the banks to prepare an opinion upon\n        the situation -- a fact which I have, so far, only confided to you.",
                "Tjaelde. I am much obliged.",
                "Berent. The smaller local banks here have combined, and are acting in\n        concert.",
                "Tjaelde. Indeed? (A pause.) I suppose you have seen Mr. Holst, then?",
                "Berent. Of course. (A pause.) If we are to assist the sound firms and\n        leave the others to their fate, the best way will certainly be for all\n        alike to disclose their actual position.",
                "Tjaelde. Is that Mr. Holst's opinion too?",
                "Berent. It is. (A pause.) I have advised him for the present -- at\n        all events till we have all the balance-sheets -- to say \"no\" to\n        every request for an advance, without exception.",
                "Tjaelde. (with a look of relief). I understand!",
                "Berent. Only a temporary measure, of course --",
                "Tjaelde. Quite so!",
                "Berent. -- but one that must apply to every one impartially.",
                "Tjaelde. Admirable!",
                "Berent. Not to treat every one alike would be to run the danger of\n        throwing premature suspicion on individuals.",
                "Tjaelde. I quite agree.",
                "Berent. I am delighted to hear it. Then you will not misunderstand me if\n        I ask you also to prepare a balance-sheet which shall show the actual\n        position of your firm.",
                "Tjaelde. With the greatest pleasure, if by doing so I can assist the\n        general welfare.",
                "Berent. I assure you, you can. It is by such means that public\n        confidence is strengthened.",
                "Tjaelde. When do you want the balance-sheet? Of course, it can only be a\n        summary one.",
                "Berent. Naturally. I will give myself the pleasure of calling for it.",
                "Tjaelde. By no means. I can let you have it at once, if you like. I am\n        in the habit of frequently drawing up summary balance-sheets of that\n        kind -- as prices rise and fall, you know.",
                "Berent. Indeed? (Smiles.) You know, of course, what they say of\n        swindlers -- that they draw up three balance-sheets everyday, and all\n        different! But you are teaching me, apparently --",
                "Tjaelde (laughing). -- that others too, may have that bad habit! -- though\n        I haven't actually got as far as three a day!",
                "Berent. Of course I was only joking. (Gets up.)",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Of course. I will send it to the hotel in an\n        hour's time; for I suppose you are staying in our only so-called hotel!\n        Would you not care, for the rest of your stay, to move your things over\n        here and make yourself at home in a couple of empty spare rooms that I\n        have?",
                "Bercnt. Thank you, but the length of my stay is so uncertain; and the\n        state of my health imposes habits upon me which are embarrassing to\n        every one, and to myself most of all, when I am among strangers.",
                "Tjaelde. But at all events I hope you will dine with us to-day? I expect\n        one or two friends. And perhaps a short sail afterwards; it is very\n        pretty among the islands here.",
                "Berent. Thank you, but my health won't allow me such dissipations.",
                "Tjaelde. Ha, ha! -- Well, if I can be of any further service to you -- ?",
                "Berent. I should be glad to have a talk with you before I leave,\n        preferably as soon as possible.",
                "Tjaelde (somewhat surprised). You mean, after you have received all the\n        balance-sheets?",
                "Berent. I have already managed to get most of them quietly, through Mr.\n        Holst.",
                "Tjaelde (more surprised). Oh -- so you mean to-day -- ?",
                "Berent. Would five o'clock suit you?",
                "Tjaelde. I am quite at your disposal! I will give myself the pleasure of\n        calling upon you at five.",
                "Berent. No, I will come here at five o'clock. (Bows, and turns to go.)",
                "Tjaelde (following him). But you are the invalid -- the older man -- and\n        a distinguished man --",
                "Berent. But you are at home here. Good-bye!",
                "Tjaelde. Let me thank you for the honour you have done me by calling\n        upon me!",
                "Berent. Please don't bother to see me out.",
                "Tjaelde. Allow me to escort you?",
                "Berent. I can find the way quite well, thank you.",
                "Tjaelde. No doubt, no doubt-but I should feel it an honour!",
                "Berent. As you please! (As they are about to go down the verandah steps\n        they are met by SIGNE and HAMAR, who are coming up arm in arm. Each\n        couple draws aside to make room for the other.)",
                "Tjaelde. Let me introduce -- no, I am sure Mr. Berent needs no\n        introduction. This is my youngest daughter -- and her fianc\u00e9,\n        Lieutenant Hamar.",
                "Berent. I thought your regiment was at the manoeuvres, Lieutenant?",
                "Hamar. I have got furlough --",
                "Berent. On account of urgent business, no doubt! Good day!",
                "Tjaelde. Ha, ha, ha! (He and BERENT go down the steps.)",
                "Hamar. Insolent fellow! But he is like that to every one.",
                "Signe. Not to my father, as far as I could see.",
                "Hamar. Your father is insolent too.",
                "Signe. You shan't say such things of father!",
                "Hamar. What else do you call it, to laugh at such impertinence as\n        Berent's.",
                "Signe. I call it good spirits! (Sits down in a rocking-chair and begins\n        rocking herself.)",
                "Hamar. Oh, then, so you -- . You are not very agreeable to-day.",
                "Signe (still rocking herself). No; do you know, sometimes I get so bored\n        with you.",
                "Hamar. Yet you won't let me go away?",
                "Signe. Because I should be still worse bored without you.",
                "Hamar. Let me tell you this, I am not going to put up much longer with\n        the way I am treated here!",
                "Signe. Very well. (Takes off her engagement ring and holds it between\n        her finger and her thumb, as she rocks herself and hums a tune.)",
                "Hamar. Oh, I don't say anything about you; but look at Valborg!\n        Look at your father! He hasn't even as much as offered me a mount on his\n        new horse!",
                "Signe. He has had something else to think about -- possibly something\n        even more important than that. (Goes on humming.)",
                "Hamar. Oh, do be nice, Signe! You must admit that my feelings are very\n        natural. Indeed, to speak quite candidly -- because I know I can say\n        anything to you -- it seems to me that, as I am to be his son-in-law\n        and am in a cavalry regiment, and as he has no sons of his own, I might\n        almost expect that -- that he would make me a present of the horse.",
                "Signe. Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. Does it seem so unreasonable to you?",
                "Signe. Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. Why do you laugh at what I say, Signe? It seems to me that it\n        would reflect very well on your family if, when my friends admired my\n        horse, I could say: \"My father-in-law made me a present of it.\" Because,\n        you know, there isn't a finer horse in the whole of Norway.",
                "Signe. And that is the reason why you should have it? Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. I won't stand it!",
                "Signe. The peerless lieutenant on the peerless horse! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Hamar. Signe, be quiet!",
                "Signe. You are so funny! (Begins to hum again.)",
                "Hamar. Listen, Signe! No one has so much influence with your father as\n        you. -- Oh, do listen! Can't you talk seriously for a moment?",
                "Signe. I should like to! (Goes on humming.)",
                "Hamar. My idea was that, if that horse were mine, I would stay here for\n        the summer and break it in thoroughly. (SIGNE stops rocking herself and\n        humming. HAMAR comes up to her chair and leans over her.) In that case I\n        would not go back till the autumn, and then you could come with the\n        horse and me into town. Wouldn't that be delightful?",
                "Signe (after looking at him for a moment). Oh, yes, my dear, you always\n        have such delightful ideas!",
                "Hamar. Don't I! But the whole thing depends, of course, on whether you\n        can get the horse from your father. Will you try, darling?",
                "Signe. And then you would stay here all the summer?",
                "Hamar. All the summer!",
                "Signe. So as to break in the horse.",
                "Hamar. Just to break in the horse!",
                "Signe. And I would go with you into town in the autumn -- that was\n        what you said, wasn't it?",
                "Hamar. Yes; wouldn't it be jolly?",
                "Signe. Shall you take the bay horse to stay with your Aunt Ulla too?",
                "Hamar (laughing). What?",
                "Signe. Well, you have spent your furlough here simply for the sake of\n        that horse -- I know that well enough -- and you propose to stay\n        here, just to break it in-and then you propose that the horse and I\n        should go to your aunt's --",
                "Hamar. But, Signe, what do you -- ?",
                "Signe (beginning to rock herself furiously). Ugh! Go away!",
                "Hamar. Jealous of a horse! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Signe. Go away to the stables.",
                "Hamar. Is that meant for a punishment? Because it would be more amusing\n        there than it is here.",
                "Signe (throwing down her ring). There! Let your horse wear that!",
                "Hamar. Every time you throw down that ring --",
                "Signe. Oh, you have said that so often! I am tired of that too! (Turns\n        her chair round so as to turn her back on him.)",
                "Hamar. You are such a spoilt child that it would be absurd to take\n        everything you say seriously --",
                "Signe. I am sick of that too, I tell you -- for the hundred and\n        twentieth time! Go away!",
                "Hamar. But can't you see how ridiculous it is of you to be jealous of a\n        horse? Have you ever heard of anyone else behaving like that?",
                "Signe (jumping up). Oh, you make me want to shout and scream! I feel so\n        ashamed of you! (Stamps her foot.) I despise you!",
                "Hamar (laughing). And all on account of the horse?",
                "Signe. No, on your own account -- yours, yours! I feel so miserable\n        sometimes, I should like to throw myself down on the floor and cry -- or\n        run away and never come back! Can't you let me alone! Can't you go away!",
                "Hamar. Yes -- and I have not picked up the ring this time, either!",
                "Signe. Oh, do go! -- go, go, go! (Bursts out crying and sits down.)",
                "Hamar. All right! -- I see the steamer in the distance; I shall go\n        home at once.",
                "Signe. Oh, you know as well as I do that that steamer goes the other\n        way! Oh! (Cries. The masts and funnel of a steamer come into sight, and\n        a trail of smoke passes over the sky. TJAELDE'S voice is heard outside,\n        calling: \"Hurry up! Take the lieutenant's boat; it is ready!\" SIGNE\n        jumps up.)",
                "Hamar. They are going to fetch some one from the steamer! (TJAELDE'S\n        voice is heard again: \"You get the boat out! He is coming here!\" HAMAR\n        runs to pick up the ring and comes back hurriedly to SIGNE.) Signe!",
                "Signe. No, I won't!",
                "Hamar. Signe, dear! What does this mean? What is it that I have done?",
                "Signe. I don't know, but I am wretchedly unhappy! (Bursts into tears.)",
                "Hamar. But you know that in the end I always do what you want? What more\n        can you wish than that?",
                "Signe. I can't help it, I wish I were dead! It is always the same thing!\n        (In tears again.)",
                "Hamar. But, Signe -- you who have told me hundreds of times that you\n        loved me!",
                "Signe. And so I do. But sometimes our engagement seems horrible! -- No,\n        don't come near me!",
                "Hamar. Signe! (TJAELDE'S voice is heard outside: \"Of course, put your\n        best coat on!\" He calls louder: \"Sannaes!\" An answering voice is heard\n        in the distance. TJAELDE continues: \"Don't forget your gloves!\") Dry\n        your eyes, Signe! Don't let him see you have been crying. (He tries to\n        give her the ring, but she turns away, wiping her eyes. TJAELDE comes up\n        the steps on to the verandah.)",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, there you are! That's right. Mr. Lind is arriving by this\n        steamer -- I had a telegram from him just now. (Calls out over the\n        verandah.) Come along with those flags! And get this boat out of the way\n        and unstep her mast! She is moored up tight! (HAMAR runs to help him.)\n        Yes, you cast her off! (HAMAR does so, and the boat is hauled away to\n        the right. TJAELDE comes forward into the room.) Signe! (Looks at her.)\n        What? Squabbling again?",
                "Signe. Father!",
                "Tjaelde. Well, this is no time for tomfoolery of that sort! You must all\n        do the honours of the house to-day. Tell Valborg --",
                "Signe. Tell her yourself, please! You know Valborg only does just what\n        she likes.",
                "Tjaelde. Don't talk such rubbish! This is an important moment -- and\n        you will all do as I say! Tell Valborg that she is to make\n        herself look nice and come to me here. And you do the same. (She goes.)\n        Signe!",
                "Signe (stopping). Yes?",
                "Tjaelde. We must ask five or six more people to dinner. You must send\n        word to Mr. Finne that we shall dine punctually at three o'clock,\n        instead of four. Mr. Lind has to go away again by the next boat, at five\n        o'clock. Do you understand?",
                "Signe. But has mother enough in the house for so many?",
                "Tjaelde. It is not a mere question of there being enough -- it must\n        be a very good dinner. I expect my larder to be kept thoroughly well\n        stocked all through the summer. How often am I to repeat that?",
                "Signe (trying to repress her fears). But mother is feeling so ill to-day --",
                "Tjaelde. Oh! don't begin about that everlasting \"feeling ill.\" There is\n        no time to-day to feel ill. Now, be quick! (SIGNE goes out by the\n        farther door. TJAELDE turns to HAMAR.) Get a pen and ink and some paper!\n        We must draw up a list of guests, at once!",
                "Hamar (looking about). There is none here.",
                "Tjaelde (impatiently). Fetch some, then! (HAMAR goes into the next room.\n        TJAELDE, after a long sigh of relief, reads a telegram he has in his\n        hand. His hand trembles as he reads it slowly, repeating some passages\n        twice.) \"Letter received just as starting. Before taking charge of\n        affairs, must have interview. Coming to-day earliest boat, return five\n        o'clock. Have clear statement ready. Lind.\" I can hardly read it -- but\n        it is true! Yes, if I can only work this properly all doors will be open\n        to me! (To HAMAR, who has come back.) Ah, there you are! It would take\n        too long to write invitations. We will just draw up a list of names and\n        one of my clerks shall run round to them all. Now then! (Dictates.) The\n        Vicar -- Oh, by the way, what is the champagne like?",
                "Hamar. Do you mean the new lot?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes.",
                "Hamar. The Vicar praised it highly.",
                "Tjaelde. Good. Well, then --",
                "Hamar (writing). The Vicar.",
                "Tjzlde. Mr. Ring.",
                "Hamar. Mr. Ring.",
                "Tjaelde. And -- and --",
                "Hamar. Mr. Holst?",
                "Tjaelde. No, not Holst. (HAMAR appears greatly astonished. TJAELDE says\n        to himself:) I can show him now that I have no need of him! (Suddenly,\n        to HAMAR.) Mr. Holm. (To himself.) Holst's enemy!",
                "Hamar. Mr. Holm.",
                "Tjaelde (to himself). Although Holm is a boor. Still, it will annoy\n        Holst. (Aloud.) The Chief Constable.",
                "Hamar. The Chief --",
                "Tjaelde. No, strike out the Chief Constable.",
                "Hamar. Chief Constable struck out.",
                "Tjaelde. Have we got the Vicar down?",
                "Hamar. He is number one on the list.",
                "Tjaelde. Of course, yes.",
                "Hamar. What about the Magistrate?",
                "Tjaelde. No, he lives too far off. Besides, unless he is the guest of\n        honour and can talk shop all the time -- . No! But, let me see. Mr.\n        Knutzon -- Knutzon with a \"z.\"",
                "Hamar. Knutzon with a \"z.\"",
                "Tjaelde. Oh! -- and -- Knudsen, too! Knudsen with an \"s.\"",
                "Hamar. Knudsen with an \"s.\"",
                "Tjaelde. How many have we got?",
                "Hamar. The Vicar, Ring, Holm, the Chief -- oh, no, the Chief\n        Constable was struck out; Knutzon with a \"z,\" Knudsen with an \"s \" -- that\n        is one, two, three, four, five, six.",
                "Tjaelde. And Finne, you, and I make nine. We must have twelve.",
                "Hamar. What about some ladies?",
                "Tjaelde. No; ladies are out of place at a business dinner. They may do\n        the honours afterwards, when we have got to the cigarette stage. But\n        whom shall we -- ?",
                "Hamar. That new lawyer fellow? He's a smart chap -- I can't remember\n        his name?",
                "Tjaelde. No, he always wants to be speechifying wherever he goes. -- Ah,\n        Mr. Pram, the custom-house officer!",
                "Hamar. That man? He always gets drunk!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, but he doesn't get noisy with it. He does no harm -- quite\n        the contrary! Yes, put down Pram.",
                "Hamar. Mr. Pram.",
                "Tjaelde. It is a very difficult task, in such a small town, when you\n        want to get a good set of people together. Ah! -- Falbe! I forgot\n        him. He is very neat, and no opinions.",
                "Hamar. Neat in his dress, do you mean?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, in his dress too-but I meant it more generally. Now, for\n        the twelfth -- Morten Schultz?",
                "Hamar. Morten Schultz! (Gets up.) No, really, I must take the liberty of\n        protesting against him! Do you really know what he did the last time he\n        was here, when you had a lot of guests? In the middle of dinner he took\n        out his false teeth and began showing them to his neighbours. He wanted\n        to have them passed round the table! If that is your idea of a good set\n        of people -- well!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, he is rather a rough diamond. But he is the richest man\n        about here.",
                "Hamar (who has sat down again). Well in that case he really ought to\n        afford himself a new wig! It is far from pleasant to sit beside him, I\n        can assure you!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, I know he is a pig; but he is wide awake, and this would\n        flatter him! You see, my young friend, when a man is very rich you must\n        make certain allowances for him.",
                "Hamar. I can't understand what you can hope to get out of him.",
                "Tjaelde. Hm, hm! -- No, well, perhaps we had better leave him out?",
                "Hamar. Certainly!",
                "Tjaelde (to himself). Although Lind would understand the significance of\n        Morten Schultz's being here --",
                "Hamar. And the things he says! Ladies have to leave the room!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, you are right. (Mutters to himself.) And, after all, I\n        don't need him any longer. (Aloud.) But what about our twelfth, then?\n        Let me see -- .",
                "Hamar. Christopher Hansen?",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, Lord! no. We should have to talk politics. No, let me see -- .\n        Yes, I think I might risk it! Hm, hm -- yes, just the man! Jakobsen,\n        the brewery manager.",
                "Hamar. Jakobsen?",
                "Tjaelde. Hm, hm! Jakobsen will do very well. I know Jakobsen.",
                "Hamar. Oh, he is a very good fellow -- we all know that, but in\n        polite society -- !",
                "Tjaelde. Hm, hm, hm! -- Put him down!",
                "Hamar (writing). Jakobsen. There, then! (Gets up.)",
                "Tjaelde. Now let Skogstad go with the list! Remember, three o'clock\n        punctually! And be quick! (Calls after HAMAR, who is going out.) And\n        come back when you have given him the list! There may be something more\n        to do! (HAMAR goes out by the nearer door. TJAELDE takes a letter out of\n        his pocket.) Ah, of course! Shall I send the balance-sheet to Berent? I\n        am independent of the banks now. Still, I am not out of the wood yet.\n        And, anyway, it is a very pretty balance-sheet! Holst would be sure to\n        see it, and that might be useful -- and it might annoy him, too.\n        Besides, if I don't send it, they will think that my promising to send\n        it had put me into a hole, and that Lind had helped me out of it. I risk\n        least by sending it. (HAMAR comes back.) Look here, let him take this\n        letter, too. It is for Mr. Berent, at the Hotel Victoria.",
                "Hamar. Is this an invitation? Because, if it is, we shall be thirteen at\n        table.",
                "Tjaelde. It is not an invitation. Be quick, before he goes. (HAMAR goes\n        out again.) Oh, if only it succeeds! Lind is the sort of man one can\n        persuade -- and I must, I must persuade him! (Looks at his watch.) I\n        have four whole hours to do it in. I have never felt so hopeful -- not\n        for a long time. (Is lost in thought; then says quietly:) After all,\n        sometimes a crisis is a good thing -- like a big wave that carries\n        one on! -- They have all had their suspicions aroused now, and are\n        all ready to get into a panic. (Sighs.) If only I could get safely out\n        of my difficulties without any one's suspecting it! -- Oh, this\n        anxious fear, night and day! -- all this mystery, these shifts, these\n        concealments, this farce I have to keep up! I go about my business as if\n        I were in a dream. (Despairingly.) This shall be the last time -- my\n        last performance of this sort! No more of it! -- I only need a\n        helping hand now, and I have got it! But have I got it? that is\n        the question. Oh! if only, after this, I could know what it was to have\n        a good night's sleep and to wake in the morning free from anxiety! -- to\n        join them at meals with an easy conscience! -- come home in the\n        evening and feel that it was all done with! If only I had something to\n        take my stand upon that I could call my own -- really and truly my\n        own!

                "(SCENE. -- The same room. The table, which has been drawn to one\n        side, is covered with bottles of champagne aged dishes of fruit. MRS.\n        TJAELDE and SIGNE, with a man-servant and a maid, are busy preparing it.\n        Through the door on the right a lively conversation can be heard, and\n        occasional bursts of laughter.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (in a tired voice). Now I think it is all ready.",
                "Signe. They are talking a long time over their dinner.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (looking at her watch). Yes, they will only have half an\n        hour for their dessert, because Mr. Lind has to leave at five o'clock.",
                "Signe. Ah, they have finished at last! Listen, they are getting up from\n        the table. (Amidst the loud noise of conversation the noise of chairs\n        being pushed back is audible.) Here they come!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes; let us retreat. (The maid goes out by the farther\n        door; SIGNE helps MRS. TJAELDE out after her. The man-servant begins\n        opening the champagne. The guests come in from the dining-room, headed\n        by LIND escorted by TJAELDE, whom he is assuring that the dinner was\n        excellent, to which TJAELDE replies that it is impossible to do much in\n        a small country town. Both look at their watches, and observe that there\n        is only half an hour left. TJAELDE vainly endeavours to persuade LIND to\n        stay longer. Close behind them come HOLM and RING, engaged in an\n        animated dispute about timber prices, the former maintaining that they\n        will fall still lower, the latter that they will rise speedily owing to\n        the fall in the prices of coal and iron, a point of view which the\n        former vigorously controverts. Immediately behind them comes the VICAR,\n        escorted by HAMAR, who is a little tipsy. The VICAR is assuring him that\n        he has no objection to parishioners repudiating the obligation to attend\n        the services of their own priest, so long as they are compelled to pay\n        him for those services whether they avail themselves of them or not;\n        because order, which is an essential characteristic of the Heavenly\n        Kingdom, must be maintained. HAMAR tries to get in a word or two about\n        the bay horse, but without success. At the same time KNUTZON and FALBE\n        are deep in a discussion about a dancer whom FALBE has seen at Hamburg.\n        He is maintaining that she can leap six feet into the air, which KNUTZON\n        ventures to doubt, but FALBE says there is no doubt about it, and he\n        knows because he has once sat at the same dinner-table with her. FINNE,\n        KNUDSEN, and JAKOBSEN follow them. JAKOBSEN is heard challenging any one\n        to contradict him, while the others eagerly protest that he has entirely\n        misunderstood their meaning. He affirms stoutly that he doesn't care a\n        damn what they meant, but that his employer is the greatest business man\n        and the finest fellow in the world, or at all events in Norway. PRAM\n        comes in by himself, wrapt in tipsy contemplation. They all talk at the\n        same time.)",
                "Tjaelde (rapping on a glass). Gentlemen! (There is a sudden silence,\n        except for the sound of the voices of FALBE and JAKOBSEN, who are hushed\n        down by the others.) Gentlemen! I am sorry dinner has occupied such a\n        long time.",
                "All (unanimously). No, no!",
                "Tjaelde. Our distinguished guest has, unfortunately, to leave us in half\n        an hour, so I should like to take the opportunity of saying a few words.\n        Gentlemen, we have a prince among us to-day. I say a prince, because if\n        it is true that it is the financiers that rule the world -- and it is\n        true, gentlemen --",

                "Voices. Sh! Sh!",

                "Tjaelde. Am I not right, then, in describing him as a prince?",

                "Tjaelde. Gentlemen, to-day his name is once more exercising its\n        powerful, I might say its creative, influence upon circumstances. I may\n        say that at this moment the country holds no truer benefactor than he.",

                "Hamar (in consternation).Good Lord, yes! (Rushes to the window, but\n        comes back.) I have no handkerchief. I must have laid it down in the\n        dining-room.",
                "Tjaelde. Here is mine!(Feels in his pocket for it.) One cannot rely on\n        you for the least thing. The salute will be too late now. It is\n        disgraceful! (HAMAR goes to the window and waves the handkerchief madly.\n        At last the report of a cannon is heard. The guests are standing in a\n        group, holding their dessert plates.)",
                "Holm. A little bit late!",
                "Knutzon. Rather behind the moment --",
                "Ring. A very important moment, however!",
                "Holm. A very unexpected one, anyway!",
                "Knutzon (jestingly). Allow me, amidst the cannon's roar, to introduce to\n        you a man who has been led by the nose!",
                "Ring. Oh, Tjaelde knows what he is about!",
                "Tjaelde. Mr. Lind is kind enough to wish to propose a toast. (They all\n        compose themselves into respectful silence.)",
                "Lind. Our worthy host has proposed my health in most flattering terms. I\n        would merely add this, that wealth is entrusted to those who have it\n        precisely in order that they may support industry, genius, and great\n        undertakings.",
                "Pram (who has never changed his position). Nobly said.",
                "Lind. I am only an administrator of a trust, and too often a weak and\n        short-sighted one.",
                "Pram. Beautiful.",
                "Lind. But I shall not be mistaken if I say that Mr. Tjaelde's many-sided\n        activities, which we must all admire, rest upon a sound foundation; and\n        of that fact no one, at the present moment, is better able to judge than\n        I. (The guests look at one another in surprise.) Therefore I have no\n        hesitation in saying that his activities are an honour to this town, to\n        this district, to our whole country, and that therefore his genius and\n        his energy deserve support. I propose the toast of \"prosperity to the\n        firm of Tjaelde!\"",

                "Knutzon. Fait accompli! That toast represents twenty thousand\n        pounds, at least.",
                "Ring. Yes, Tjaelde knows what he is about! I have always said that!\n        (FALBE is seen drinking ceremoniously with LIND. JAKOBSEN comes forward,\n        talking to KNUDSEN.)",

I\n        am-what I am, gentlemen! And therefore if any here is qualified to talk\n        about Mr. Tjaelde, it is I; because I know him. I know he is a fine\n        fellow.",

                "Lind (a shade coldly). Don't mention it, Mr. Tjaelde! Good luck to your\n        business! (In warmer tones.) Good-bye everybody -- and thank you all\n        for your kindness! (The footman, who has for some time been holding out\n        his hat to him, gives it him, and his coat to SANNAES. LIND steps on\n        board the boat.)",
                "All. Good-bye, Mr. Lind, good-bye!",
                "Tjaelde. One cheer more! (Cheers and a cannon salute are heard together.\n        The boat glides away. They all wave their handkerchiefs. TJAELDE hurries\n        into the room.) I have no handkerchief; that blockhead has -- .\n        (Looks at VALBORG.) Why are you not waving?",
                "Valborg. Because I don't wish to. (TJAELDE looks at her, but says\n        nothing. He goes into the other room and comes back with a table-napkin\n        in each hand, and hurries on to the verandah.)",
                "Tjaelde (waving and shouting). Good-bye! Good-bye!",
                "Signe. Let us go out to the point and see the last of them!",
                "All. Yes, yes! (All but TJAELDE and VALBORG hurry off to the right.)",
                "Tjaelde (coming into the room). I saw Berent coming! (VALBORG goes out\n        by the door on the right. TJAELDE comes forward, throws the napkins on\n        to a table and himself into a chair.) Oh -- oh! But this must be the\n        last time. -- I shan't need this sort of thing any more! Never again!\n        (Gets up wearily.) Ah, I had forgotten. Berent!",
                "[The Curtain falls.]",
                "[The interval between this scene and the next should be as short as\n        possible.]",
                "(SCENE.-TJAELDE'S private office. On the left, a desk strewn with\n        ledgers and papers. On the right, a stove. An easy chair by the stove. A\n        table in the foreground to the right; on it an inkstand and pens. Two\n        armchairs; one at the table facing the audience, the other at the side\n        of the table. Windows on either side of the desk; a door beyond the\n        stove. A door in the background, leading to other offices. A bell-pull\n        hangs down the wall. A chair on either side of the door. Quite at the\n        back, on the left, a staircase leading direct to TJAELDE'S bedroom.\n        BERENT and TJAELDE come in from the back.)",
                "Tjaelde. You must excuse my receiving you here. But the other rooms are\n        all upside down; we have had some people to dinner.",
                "Berent. I heard you had guests.",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, Mr. Lind from Christiana.",
                "Berent. Quite so.",
                "Tjaelde. Won't you sit down? (BERENT lays down his hat and coat on a\n        chair by the door. He comes slowly forward, sits down at the side of the\n        table, and takes some papers from his breast-pocket. TJAELDE sits down\n        at the other chair by the table and watches him indifferently.)",
                "Berent. What we now want is some fixed standard by which to make our\n        valuations, especially of real estate. Have you any objection to our\n        making your business a basis for arriving at that?",
                "Tjaelde. None at all.",
                "Berent. Then may I make my comments on your own figures, and ask you a\n        few questions about them?",
                "Tjaelde. By all means.",
                "Berent. Well, to begin with, let us take your properties immediately\n        round here; they will give us the best idea of local values. For\n        instance, take the Mj\u00f6lstad forest; you have put that down, I see, at\n        \u00a316,500.",
                "Tjaelde (indifferently). Have I?",
                "Berent. You bought it for \u00a310,000.",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, four years ago. Timber prices ruled low then.",
                "Berent. And since then you have cut down more than \u00a320,000 worth of\n        timber there.",
                "Tjaelde. Who told you so?",
                "Berent. Mr. Holst.",
                "Tjaelde. Holst knows nothing about it.",
                "Berent. We must try to be very accurate, you know.",
                "Tjaelde. Well, of course, the whole valuation is not my concern; but\n        those whom it does concern will protest.",
                "Berent (taking no notice of his objection). So I think we will reduce\n        the \u00a316,500 to \u00a310,000.",
                "Tjaelde. To \u00a310,000! (Laughs.) As you please.",
                "Berent. Calculating by the same standard, we can scarcely put down the\n        Stav forest at more than \u00a34000.",
                "Tjaelde. Allow me to say that, if that is the way you are going to make\n        your valuation, everybody in the place will have to go bankrupt!",
                "Berent (with a smile). We will risk that. You have put down your wharf\n        and its contents at \u00a312,000.",
                "Tjaelde. Including two ships in course of construction --",
                "Berent. -- for which it would be difficult to find a purchaser, as\n        they are so far from completion.",
                "Tjaelde. Indeed?",
                "Berent. So I think we cannot put down the wharf and its contents at a\n        higher figure than \u00a38,000 -- and I believe even that will turn out to\n        be too high.",
                "Tjaelde. If you can find me another wharf as well stocked, and with the\n        advantages that this one has, I will buy it whenever you like for \u00a38000;\n        I am certain I should be more than \u00a34000 to the good over the bargain.",
                "Berent. May I go on?",
                "Tjaelde. If you like! I even feel a certain curiosity to view my\n        possessions under such an entirely new light.",
                "Berent. As a matter of fact the items that are too highly valued are\n        just those that comprise this property that you live on -- its land,\n        its gardens, its dwelling houses, warehouses, and quays-not to mention\n        the brewery and the factory, which I shall come to later. Even regarded\n        as business premises they seem to me to be over-valued.",
                "Tjaelde. Well?",
                "Berent, Moreover, the luxurious appointments of this house of yours,\n        which would very probably be superfluous for any one else, cannot\n        possibly be counted upon to realise their full value in a sale. Suppose -- as\n        is indeed most likely -- that it were a countryman that bought the\n        place?",
                "Tjaelde. You are reckoning me as turned out of it already, then!",
                "Berent. I am obliged to base all my calculations on what the property\n        would fetch if sold now.",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). What may you happen to value it at then?",
                "Berent. At less than half your valuation; that is to say at --",
                "Tjaelde. You must really forgive me if I use an expression which has\n        been on the tip of my tongue for some time: this is scandalous! You\n        force yourself into a man's house, and then, under pretext of asking for\n        his opinion, you practically -- on paper -- rob him of his\n        possessions!",
                "Berent. I don't understand you. I am trying to arrive at a basis for\n        values hereabouts; and you said yourself, did you not, that it is a\n        matter that does not concern you alone?",
                "Tjaelde. Certainly; but even in jest -- if I may be allowed the\n        expression -- one does not take the statement that an honourable man\n        has voluntarily offered and treat it as a mendacious document.",
                "Berent. There are many different points of view from which valuations\n        can be made, obviously. I see nothing more in it than that.",
                "Tjaelde. But don't you understand that this is like cutting into my\n        living flesh? Bit by bit, my property has been brought together or\n        created by my own work, and preserved by the most strenuous exertions on\n        my part under terribly trying conditions -- it is bound up with my\n        family, with all that is dear to me -- it has become a part of my\n        very life!",
                "Berent (with a bow). I understand that perfectly. You have put down the\n        Brewery at --",
                "Tjaelde. No; I refuse to allow you to go on in this way. You must find\n        some one else's property as a basis for your calculations -- you must\n        consult some one else, whose idea of business corresponds somewhat\n        closer to your own ridiculous one.",
                "Berent (leaning back in his chair). That is a pity. The banks were\n        anxious to be acquainted with your answers to my observations.",
                "Tjaelde. Have you sent my statement to the banks?",
                "Berent. With my remarks and comments on it, and Mr. Holst's.",
                "Tjaelde. This has been a trap, then? I believed I had to deal with a\n        gentleman!",
                "Berent. The banks or I, what is the difference? It comes to the same\n        thing, as I represent them unreservedly.",
                "Tjaelde. Such impudent audacity is unpardonable!",
                "Berent. I would suggest that we avoid hard words -- at all events,\n        for the moment -- and rather consider the effect that will be\n        produced by the balance-sheet sent in.",
                "Tjaelde. That some of us will see!",
                "Berent. The banking house of Lind & Co., for instance?",
                "Tjaelde. Do you mean to say that my balance-sheet, ornamented with\n        marginal notes by you and Holst, is to be submitted to Mr. Lind's firm\n        too?",
                "Berent. When the cannon-salutes and noise of your festivities\n        enlightened me as to the situation, I took the liberty of making some\n        inquiries of the banks.",
                "Tjaelde. So you have been spying here, too? You have been trying to\n        undermine my business connections?",
                "Berent. Is your position such, then, that you are afraid?",
                "Tjaelde. The question is not my position, but your behaviour!",
                "Berent. I think we had better keep to the point. You have put down the\n        Brewery at --",
                "Tjaelde. No; your conduct is so absolutely underhanded that, as an\n        honest man, I must refuse all further dealing with you. I am, as I said\n        before, accustomed to have to deal with gentlemen.",
                "Berent. I think you misunderstand the situation. Your indebtedness to\n        the banks is so considerable that a settlement of it may reasonably be\n        required of you. But to effect that you must work with us in the matter.",
                "Tjaelde (after a moment's thought). Very well! But, no more details -- let\n        me know your conclusions, briefly.",
                "Berent. My conclusions, briefly, are that you have estimated your assets\n        at \u00a390,800. I estimate them at \u00a340,600.",
                "Tjaelde (quietly). That is to say, you make me out to have a deficit of\n        about \u00a330,000?",
                "Berent. As to that, I must point out that your estimate of your\n        liabilities does not agree with mine, either.",
                "Tjaelde (quietly). Oh, of course not!",
                "Berent. For instance, the dividend that M\u00f6ller's estate is to yield to\n        you.",
                "Tjaelde. No more details! What do you put my total liabilities at?",
                "Berent. Let me see. Your total liabilities amount, according to your\n        calculations, to \u00a370,000. I estimate them at \u00a380,000 -- to be\n        precise, at \u00a379,372.",
                "Tjaelde. That puts my deficit at about --",
                "Berent. At about \u00a339,400 -- or, in round figures, \u00a340,000.",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, by all means let us stick to round figures!",
                "Berent. So that the difference between your views of your balance-sheet\n        and mine is that, whereas you give yourself a surplus of about \u00a320,000,\n        I give you a deficit of about \u00a340,000.",
                "Tjaelde. Thank you very much. -- Do you know my opinion of the whole\n        matter? (BERENT looks up at him.) That I am in this room with a madman.",
                "Berent. I have had the same opinion for some time. -- The stock of\n        timber you hold in France I have not been able to deal with; you have\n        forgotten to include it in your account. Perhaps it may make a little\n        difference.",
                "Tjaelde. It is of no consequence! I have often enough heard people speak\n        of your callousness and your heartlessness; but their account of you has\n        come nowhere near the truth. I don't know why I have not turned you out\n        of my house long before this; but you will have the goodness to leave it\n        now!",
                "Berent. We shall both leave presently. But before we do, we must discuss\n        the question of handing over the house to the Receiver in Bankruptcy.",
                "Tjaelde. Ha, ha, ha! Allow me to inform you that at this very moment a\n        sum is being telegraphed to me which will be sufficient not only to\n        cover my present liabilities, but to set me straight in every direction!",
                "Berent. The telegraph is a useful invention which is open to every one.",
                "Tjaelde (after a moment's thought). What do you mean by that?",
                "Berent. One effect of the noise of your festivities was that I used the\n        telegraph also. Mr. Lind will receive, on board the boat, a telegram\n        from his firm -- and I doubt if the money you speak of will be\n        forthcoming.",
                "Tjaelde. It is not true! You have not dared to do that!",
                "Berent. The facts are exactly as I state.",
                "Tjaelde. Give me my balance-sheet; let me look at it again. (Stretches\n        out his hand to take it.)",
                "Berent (taking it up). Excuse me!",
                "Tjaelde. Do you presume to keep back my own balance-sheet in my own\n        writing?",
                "Berent. Yes, and even to put it in my pocket. (Does so.) A fraudulent\n        balance-sheet, dated and signed, is a document of some importance.",
                "Tjaelde. You are determined to ruin my private and public reputation?",
                "Berent. You have been working for that yourself for a long time. I know\n        your position. For a month past I have been in correspondence with all\n        the quarters in which you have business connections, both here any I\n        abroad.",
                "Tjaelde. What underhanded deceitfulness an honest man is exposed to!\n        Here have I been surrounded by spies for the last month! A plot between\n        my business acquaintances and the banks! A snake creeping into my house\n        and crawling over my accounts! But I will break up the conspiracy! And\n        you will find out what it mean, to try and ruin a reputable firm by\n        underhand devices!",
                "Berent. This is no time for fine phrases. Do you propose to surrender\n        your property at once?",
                "Tjaelde. Ha, ha! I am to surrender it because you have made me out a\n        bankrupt on your bit of paper!",
                "Berent. You might conceal the facts for a month, I know. But for your\n        own sake, and especially for the sake of others, I would urgently advise\n        you to end the matter at once. That was the reason of my journey here.",
                "Tjaelde. Ah, now the truth is out! And you came here pretending a\n        friendly concern that the tangle should be straightened out! We were to\n        distinguish between the sound and unsound firms, and you requested me,\n        most politely, to give you my assistance in the matter!",
                "Berent. Exactly. But there is no question of anything unsound here\n        except your own business and what is bound up with it.",
                "Tjaelde (when he has controlled himself). So you came into my house with\n        the hidden design of ruining me?",
                "Berent. I must repeat that it is not I that am responsible for your\n        bankruptcy; it is yourself.",
                "Tjaelde. And I must repeat that my bankruptcy only exists in your\n        imagination! Much may happen in a month; and I have shown that I can\n        find a way out of difficulties before now!",
                "Berent. That is to say, by involving yourself deeper and deeper in\n        falsehood.",
                "Tjaelde. Only a man of business can understand such things. But, if you\n        really understand them, I would say to you: \"Give me \u00a320,000 and I will\n        save the situation entirely.\" That would be doing something worthy of\n        your great powers; that would give you a reputation for penetration in\n        discerning the real state of affairs; because by so doing you would\n        safeguard the welfare of more than a thousand people, and ensure a\n        prosperous future for the whole district!",
                "Berent. I don't rise to that bait.",
                "Tjaelde (after a moment's reflection). Do you want me to explain to you\n        how \u00a320,000 would be sufficient to set the whole complicated situation\n        straight? Within three months remittances would be coming in. I can make\n        it its clear as daylight to you --",
                "Berent. -- that you would be falling from one disillusionment to\n        another! That is what you have been doing for the last three years, from\n        month to month.",
                "Tjaelde. Because the last three years have been bad years -- horrible\n        years! But we have reached the crisis; things must begin to improve now!",
                "Berent. That is what every defaulter thinks.",
                "Tjaelde. Do not drive me to despair! Have you any idea what I have gone\n        through in these three years? Have you any idea what I am capable of?",
                "Berent. Of still further falsehood.",
                "Tjaelde. Take care! -- It is quite true that I am standing on the\n        edge of a precipice. It is true that for three years I have done\n        everything in mortal power to save the situation! I maintain that there\n        has been something heroic in the fight I have made. And that deserves\n        some reward. You have unrestricted powers; every one trusts you. Realise\n        for yourself what your mission is; do not let it be necessary for me to\n        teach it you! Let me tell you this, emphatically: it will be a dreadful\n        thing for you if hundreds of people are to be ruined\n        unnecessarily now!",
                "Berent. Let us make an end of this.",
                "Tjaelde. No, devil take me if I give up a fight like this with a\n        senseless surrender!",
                "Berent. How do you propose to end it, then?",
                "Tjaelde. There is no issue to it that I have not turned over in my\n        thoughts -- thousands of times. I know what I shall do! I\n        won't be a mark for the jeers of this wretched little town, nor\n        triumphed over by those who have envied me all round the countryside!",
                "Berent. What will you do, then?",
                "Tjaelde. You shall see! (Speaking more and more excitedly.) You won't\n        help me under any conditions?",
                "Berent. No.",
                "Tjaelde. You insist that I shall surrender my estate, here and now?",
                "Berent. Yes.",
                "Tjaelde. Hell and damnation! You dare do that?",
                "Berent. Yes.",
                "Tjaelde (his agitation robbing him of his voice, which all at once sinks\n        to a hoarse whisper). You have never known what despair is! -- You\n        don't know what an existence I have endured!-But if the decisive moment\n        has come, and I have a man here in my office who ought to save me\n        but will not, then that man shall share what is in store for me.",
                "Berent (leaning back in his chair). This is beginning to be impressive.",
                "Tjaelde. No more jesting; you might regret it! (Goes to all the doors\n        and locks them with a key which he takes out of his pocket; then unlocks\n        his desk, and takes a revolver out of it.) How long do you suppose I\n        have had this in here?",
                "Berent. Since you bought it, I suppose.",
                "Tjaelde. And why do you suppose I bought it? -- Do you suppose that\n        after I have been master of this town and the biggest man in the\n        district, I would endure the disgrace of bankruptcy?",
                "Berent. You have been enduring it for a long time.",
                "Tjaelde. It is in your power now either to ruin me or to wave me. You\n        have behaved in such a way that you deserve no mercy -- and you shall\n        have none! Report to the banks that they may give me the use of \u00a314,000\n        for a year -- I need no more than that -- and I will save the\n        situation for good and all. Think seriously, now! Remember my family,\n        remember how long my firm has been established, remember the numbers\n        that would be ruined if I were! And do not forget to think of your own\n        family! Because, if you don't agree to what I ask, neither of us\n        shall leave this room alive!",
                "Berent (pointing to the revolver). Is it loaded?",
                "Tjaelde (putting his finger on the trigger). You will find that out in\n        good time. You must answer me now!",
                "Berent. I have a suggestion to make. Shoot yourself first and me\n        afterwards.",
                "Tjaelde (going up to him and holding the revolver to his head). I will\n        soon quiet your pretty wit.",
                "Berent (getting up, and taking out of his pocket a paper which he\n        unfolds). This is a formal surrender of your estate to the Receiver in\n        Bankruptcy. If you sign it, you will be doing your duty to your\n        creditors, to your family, and to yourself. Shooting yourself and me\n        would only be adding an acted lie to all your others. Put away your\n        revolver and take up your pen!",
                "Tjaelde. Never! I had resolved on this long ago. But you shall keep me\n        company, now!",
                "Berent. Do what you please. But you cannot threaten me into a falsehood.",
                "Tjaelde (who has lowered the revolver, takes a step back, raises the\n        revolver and aims at BERENT). Very well!",
                "Berent (walking up to TJAELDE and looking him straight in the eyes,\n        while the latter reluctantly lowers the revolver). Do you suppose I\n        don't know that a man who has for so long shivered with falsehood and\n        terror in his inmost heart has lots of schemes but no courage? You dare\n        not do it!",
                "Tjaelde (furiously). I will show you! (Steps back and raises the\n        revolver again.)",
                "Berent (following him). Shoot, and you will hear a report -- that is\n        what you are longing for, I suppose! Or, give up your plan of shooting,\n        think of what you have done, confess, and afterwards hold your tongue!",
                "Tjaelde. No; may the devil take both you and me --",
                "Berent. And the horse?",
                "Tjaelde. The horse?",
                "Berent. I mean the magnificent charger on which you came galloping home\n        from the sale of M\u00f6ller's estate. You had better let some one shoot you\n        on horseback -- on what was your last and greatest piece of business\n        duplicity! (Goes nearer to him and speaks more quietly.) Or -- strip\n        yourself of the tissue of lies which enfolds you, and your bankruptcy\n        will bring you more blessing than your riches have ever done. (TJAELDE\n        lets the revolver drop out of his hand, and sinks into a chair in an\n        outburst of tears. There is silence for a moment.) You have made an\n        amazing fight of it for these last three years. I do not believe I know\n        any one who could have done what you have done. But you have lost the\n        fight this time. Do not shrink now from a final settlement and the pain\n        that it must cost you. Nothing else will cleanse your soul for you.",
                "Tjaelde (weeping unrestrainedly, with his face buried in his hands). Oh,\n        oh!",
                "Berent. You have blamed me for my method of proceeding in the matter. My\n        answer to that is that I forgive you for yours. (A pause.) Try now to\n        look the situation in the face, and take it like a man.",
                "Tjaelde (as before). Oh!",
                "Berent. At the bottom of your heart you must be weary of it all; make an\n        end of it all now!",
                "Tjaelde (as before). Oh!",
                "Berent (sitting down beside him, after a moment's pause). Wouldn't you\n        like to feel your conscience clear again -- to be able really to live\n        with your wife and children? Because I am sure you have not done that\n        for many a day.",
                "Tjaelde (as before). Oh!",
                "Berent. I have known many speculators in my time and have received many\n        confessions. So I know what you have been robbed of for three years -- never\n        a good night's rest, never a meal eaten with a light heart. You have\n        scarcely been conscious of what your children were doing or saying,\n        except when accident brought you together. And your wife --",
                "Tjaelde. My wife!",
                "Berent. Yes, she has slaved hard enough to prepare these banquets that\n        were to conceal the nakedness of the land. Indeed, she has been the\n        hardest worked servant in your house.",
                "Tjaelde. My patient, good wife!",
                "Berent. I feel certain you would rather be the humblest labourer earning\n        your daily bread than live through such suffering again.",
                "Tjaelde. A thousand times rather!",
                "Berent. Then can you hesitate to do what will give every man his due,\n        and bring you back to truthfulness again? Take the paper and sign it!",
                "Tjaelde (falling on his knees). Mercy, mercy! You do not know what you\n        are asking me. My own children will curse me. I have just heard of a\n        child doing that to her father! And my business friends, who will be\n        ruined with me -- numbers of them -- think of their families! Oh!\n        What is to become of my work-people? Do you know there are more than\n        four hundred of them? Think of them and their families, robbed of their\n        livelihood! -- Be merciful! I cannot, I dare not, do it! Save me,\n        help me! It was horrible of me to try and threaten you; but now I\n        implore you, for the sake of all those that deserve more than I, but to\n        whom I shall devote the rest of my life in loyal work!",
                "Berent. I cannot save you, least of all with money that belongs to\n        others. What you ask me to do would be disloyalty to them.",
                "Tjaelde. No, no! Publish my accounts openly -- put me under trustees,\n        if you like; but let me go on with the scheme that I believe will\n        succeed! Every clear-headed man will see that it must succeed!",
                "Berent. Come and sit down. Let us discuss it. (TJAELDE sits down.) Isn't\n        what you are now proposing exactly what you have been trying to do for\n        the last three years? You have been able to borrow the means; but\n        what good has it done?",
                "Tjaelde. Times have been so bad!",
                "Berent (shaking his head). You have mixed up falsehood and truth for so\n        long that you have forgotten the simplest laws of commerce. To speculate\n        during bad times, on the chance of their becoming better, is all very\n        well for those who can afford it. Others must leave such things alone.",
                "Tjaelde. But it is to the advantage of my creditors themselves, and of\n        the banks too, that my estate should hold together!",
                "Berent. It is of no advantage to sound firms to prop up unsound ones.",
                "Tjaelde. But, surely, to avoid losing their capital -- ?",
                "Berent, Oh, perhaps in the Receiver's hands the estate may --",
                "Tjaelde (hopefully, half rising from his chair). Yes? Well?",
                "Berent. But not till you have been removed from the control of it.",
                "Tjaelde (sinking down again). Not till I have been removed from the\n        control of it!",
                "Berent. On its own resources I dare say the estate can hold out\n        until better times come, but not on borrowed money.",
                "Tjaelde. Not on borrowed money --",
                "Berent. You understand the difference, of course?",
                "Tjaelde. Oh, yes.",
                "Berent. Good. Then you must understand that there is nothing left for\n        you to do but to sign this.",
                "Tjaelde. Nothing left but to sign --",
                "Berent. Here is the paper. Come, now!",
                "Tjaelde (rousing himself). Oh, I cannot, I cannot!",
                "Berent. Very well. But in that case the crash will come of itself in a\n        short time, and everything will be worse than it is now.",
                "Tjaelde (falling on his knees).Mercy, mercy! I cannot let go of all\n        hope! Think, after a fight like mine!",
                "Berent. Tell the truth and say: \"I haven't the courage to face the\n        consequences.\"",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, that is the truth.",
                "Berent. \"I haven't the courage to begin an honest life.\"",
                "Tjaelde. Yes.",
                "Berent. You don't know what you are saying, man!",
                "Tjaelde. No, I don't. But spare me!",
                "Berent (getting up). This is nothing but despair! I am sorry for you.",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Yes, surely you must be? Try me! Ask me to do\n        anything you like! Tell me what you --",
                "Berent. No, no! Before anything else, you must sign this.",
                "Tjaelde (sinking back into his chair). Oh! -- How shall I ever dare\n        to look any one in the face again? -- I, who, have defied everything\n        and deceived every one!",
                "Berent. The man who has enjoyed the respect which he did not deserve\n        must some day undergo the humiliation which he has deserved. That is a\n        law; and I cannot save you from that.",
                "Tjaelde. But they will be crueller to me than to any one else! I deserve\n        it, I know; but I shall not be able to endure it!",
                "Berent. Hm! You are remarkably tough; your fight, these last three\n        years, proves that.",
                "Tjaelde. Be merciful! Surely your ingenuity -- your influence -- must\n        be able to find some way out for me?",
                "Berent. Yes. The way out is for you to sign this.",
                "Tjaelde. Won't you even take it over from me by private contract? If you\n        did that, everything would come right.",
                "Berent. Sign! Here is the paper! Every hour is precious.",
                "Tjaelde. Oh! (Takes up a pen; but turns to BERENT with a gesture of\n        supplication.) Daren't you test me, after what I have just gone through?",
                "Berent. Yes, when you have signed. (TJAELDE signs the paper, and sinks\n        back in his chair with an expression of the keenest anguish. BERENT\n        takes the paper, folds it, and puts it in his pocket-book.) Now I will\n        go to the Bankruptcy Court with this, and afterwards to the telegraph\n        office. Probably the officials of the court will come this evening to\n        make their inventory. So you ought to warn your family.",
                "Tjaelde. How shall I be able to do that? Give me a little time! Be\n        merciful!",
                "Berent. The sooner the better for you -- not to speak of the\n        interests of all concerned. Well, I have finished for the present.",
                "Tjaelde. Don't desert me like this! Don't desert me!",
                "Berent. You would like your wife to come to you, wouldn't you?",
                "Tjaelde (resignedly). Yes.",
                "Berent (taking up the revolver). And this -- I will not take it with\n        me. There is no danger from it now. But I will put it in the desk, for\n        the sake of the others. Now, if you or yours should need me, send word\n        to me.",
                "Tjaelde. Thank you.",
                "Berent. I shall not leave the town until the worst is over. -- Remember,\n        night or day, if you need me, send word to me.",
                "Tjaelde. Thank you.",
                "Berent. And now will you unlock the door for me?",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Ah, of course. Excuse me!",
                "Berent (taking his hat and coat). Won't you call your wife now?",
                "Tjaelde. No. I must have a little time first. I have the worst part of\n        it before me now.",
                "Berent. I believe you have, and that is just why -- . (Takes hold of\n        the bell-pull and rings the bell.)",
                "Tjaelde. What are you doing?",
                "Berent. I want, before I go, to be sure of your wife's coming to you.",
                "Tjaelde. You should not have done that! (An office-boy comes in. BERENT\n        looks at TJAELDE.) Ask your mistress -- ask my wife to come to me.",
                "Berent. At once, please. (The boy goes out.) Good-bye! (Goes out.\n        TJAELDE sinks down on to a chair by the door.)",

                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Henning! (They both burst into tears and fall into each\n        other's arms. MRS. TJAELDE whispers to him:) Shall I call the children?",
                "Tjaelde (in a whisper). No, say nothing -- till later! (They embrace\n        again. He takes up the bag.) Go to the window, so that I can see you\n        when I mount. (Shuts the bag and hurries to the door, but stops.) My\n        dear!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes?",
                "Tjaelde. Forgive me!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Everything! (TJAELDE, as he is hurrying out, meets in the\n        doorway an office-boy who is bringing him a letter. TJAELDE takes it,\n        and the boy goes out.)",
                "Tjaelde. From Berent! (Opens the letter, stands in the doorway and reads\n        it; then comes back into the room, with his bag in his hand, and reads\n        it again.) \"When I left your house, I saw a horse standing saddled at\n        your door. To prevent misunderstanding, let me inform you that your\n        house is watched by the police.\"",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (supporting herself on the desk). You can't go?",
                "Tjaelde. No. (A pause. He puts down the bag and wipes his forehead.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Henning, shall we pray together?",
                "Tjaelde. What do you mean?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Pray -- pray to God to help us? (Bursts into tears.\n        TJAELDE is silent. She falls on her knees.) Come, Henning! You see that\n        all human ingenuity is of no avail!",
                "Tjaelde. I know that, only too well.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Well, try once, in this hour of our greatest need!\n        (TJAELDE appears to be struggling with his emotion.) You never would!\n        You have never confided in us, or in your God! -- never opened your\n        heart to any one!",
                "Tjaelde. Be quiet!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. But what you concealed by day, you used to talk of in the\n        night. We mortals must talk, you know! But I have lain awake and\n        listened to your distress. Now you know why I am no longer good for\n        anything. No sleep at night, and none of your confidence in the daytime.\n        I have suffered even more than you. (TJAELDE throws himself into a\n        chair. She goes to him.) You wanted to run away. When we are afraid of\n        our fellow-men, we have only Him to turn to. Do you think I should be\n        alive now, if it were not for Him?",
                "Tjaelde. I have thrown myself imploringly at His feet, but always in\n        vain!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Henning, Henning!",
                "Tjaelde. Why did He not bless my work and the fight I was making? It is\n        all one now.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Ah, there is more to come.",
                "Tjaelde (getting up). Yes, the worst is before us now --",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. -- because it is in our own hearts! (A pause. VALBORG\n        appears coming down the stair, but stops at the sight of the others.)\n        What do you want, dear?",
                "Valborg (with suppressed emotion). From my room I can see the police\n        watching the house. Are the Receiver's men coming now?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (sitting down). Yes, my child. After a terrible struggle -- how\n        terrible, his God and I alone know -- your father has just sent in\n        his declaration of bankruptcy. (VALBORG takes a step or two forward,\n        then stands still. A pause.)",
                "Tjaelde (unable to control himself). Now I suppose you will say to me\n        just what M\u00f6ller's daughter said to him!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (getting up). You won't do that, Valborg! -- God alone\n        can judge him.",
                "Tjaelde. Tell me how cruelly I have wronged you! Tell me that you will\n        never be able to forgive me -- (breaking down) -- that I have lost\n        your respect and your love for ever!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Oh, my child!",
                "Tjaelde. That your anger and your shame know no bounds!",
                "Valborg. Oh, father, father! (Goes out by the door at the back. TJAELDE\n        tries to cross the room, as if to follow her, but can only stagger as\n        far as the staircase, to which he clings for support. MRS. TJAELDE sinks\n        back into her chair. There is a long pause. Suddenly JAKOBSEN cones in\n        from the outer once, dressed as before except that he has changed his\n        coat. TJAELDE is not aware of his entrance until JAKOBSEN is close to\n        him; then he stretches out his hands to him as if in entreaty, but\n        JAKOBSEN goes right up to him and speaks in a voice choked with rage.)",
                "Jakobsen. You scoundrel! (TJAELDE recoils.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Jakobsen! Jakobsen!",
                "Jakobsen (without heeding her). The Receiver's men are here. The books\n        and papers at the Brewery have been seized. Work is at a standstill -- and\n        the same thing at the factory.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. My God!",
                "Jakobsen. And I had made myself responsible for twice as much as I\n        possessed! (He speaks low, but his voice vibrates with anger and\n        emotion.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Dear Jakobsen!",
                "Jakobsen (turning to her). Didn't I say to him, every time he told me to\n        sign, \"But I don't possess as much as that! It's not right!\" -- But\n        he used to answer, \"It is only a matter of form, Jakobsen.\" \"Yes, but\n        not an honourable form,\" I used to say. \"It is a matter of form in\n        business,\" he would say; \"all business folk do it.\" And all I knew of\n        business, I had learnt from him; so I trusted him. (With emotion.) And\n        he made me do it time after time. And now I owe more than I shall ever\n        be able to pay, all my life. I shall live and die a dishonoured man.\n        What have you to say to that, Mrs. Tjaelde? (She does not answer him. He\n        turns angrily upon TJAELDE.) Do you hear? Even she can find\n        nothing to say! -- Scoundrel!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Jakobsen!",
                "Jakobsen (in a voice broken with emotion). I have nothing but the\n        deepest respect for you, Mrs. Tjaelde. But, you see, he has made me\n        swindle other people! In his name I shall have ruined numbers of them.\n        They trusted me, you see; just as I trusted him. I used to tell them\n        that he was a benefactor to the whole countryside, and that therefore\n        they ought to help him in these hard times. And now there will be many\n        an honest family robbed of house and home by our treachery. And that is\n        what he has brought me to! What heartless cruelty! (To TJAELDE.) I can\n        tell I feel inclined to -- . (Takes a threatening step towards him.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (getting up). For my sake, Jakobsen!",
                "Jakobsen (restraining himself). Yes, for your sake, ma'am; because I\n        have the deepest respect for you. But how am I to face all those poor\n        creatures that I have ruined? It will do them no good to explain to them\n        how it has happened; that won't help them to get their daily bread! How\n        shall I face my own wife! (With emotion.) She has had such faith in me,\n        and in those I trusted. And my children, too? It is very hard on\n        children, because they hear so much talk in the street. It won't be long\n        before they hear what sort of a father they have got; and they will hear\n        it from the children of the men I have ruined.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. As you feel how hard it is yourself, that should make you\n        willing to spare others. Be merciful!",
                "Jakobsen. I have the deepest respect for you; but it is hard that in my\n        home we should never again be able to eat a crust that we can properly\n        call our own -- for I owe more than I can ever live to repay! That is\n        hard, Mrs. Tjaelde! What will become of my evenings with my children\n        now? -- of our Sundays together? No, I mean that he shall hear the\n        truth from me. (Turns upon TJAELDE.) You scoundrel! You shan't escape\n        me! (TJAELDE shrinks back in terror and tries to reach the office door,\n        but at that moment the RECEIVER comes in, followed by two of his clerks\n        and SANNAES. TJAELDE crosses the room, staggers to his desk, and leans\n        upon it with his back turned to the newcomers.)",
                "The Receiver (coming up behind Tjaelde). Excuse me! May I have your\n        books and papers? (TJAELDE gives a start, moves away to the stove, and\n        supports himself on it.)",
                "Jakobsen (in a whisper, standing over him). Scoundrel! (TJAELDE moves\n        away from him and sits down on a chair by the door, hiding his face in\n        his hands.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (getting up and whispering to JAKOBSEN), Jakobsen!\n        Jakobsen! (He comes towards her.) He has never deliberately cheated any\n        one! He has never been what you say, and never will be! (Sits down\n        again.)",
                "Jakobsen. I have the deepest respect for you, Mrs. Tjaelde. But\n        if he is not a liar and swindler, there is no truth in anything!\n        (Bursts into tears. MRS. TJAELDE hides her face in her hands as she\n        leans back in her chair. A short silence. Then a confused noise of\n        voices is heard without. The RECEIVER and his men stop their work of\n        sorting and inventorying papers, and all look up.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (apprehensively). What is that? (SANNAES and the RECEIVER\n        go to one window, and JAKOBSEN to another.)",
                "Jakobsen. It's the hands from the quay and the brewery and the factory\n        and the warehouse. All work is stopped until further orders; but this is\n        pay-day -- and there is no pay for them! (The others resume their\n        work.)",
                "Tjaelde (coming forward despairingly). I had forgotten that!",
                "Jakobsen (going up to him). Well, go out and face them, and they will\n        let you know what you are!",
                "Tjaelde (in a low voice, as he takes up his saddle-bag). Here is money,\n        but it is all in gold. Go into the town and get it changed, and pay\n        them!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, do, Jakobsen!",
                "Jakobsen (in lower tones). If you ask me to, ma'am, I -- So\n        there is money in this bag? (Opens it.) And all done up in rolls. He\n        meant to bolt, then! -- and with the money his people had lent him.\n        And yet you say he is not a scoundrel! (TJAELDE gives a groan. The noise\n        of voices without grows louder.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (in a low voice). Be quick, or we shall have them in here.",
                "Jakobsen. I will go.",
                "The Receiver (interposing). Excuse me, but nothing must be taken away\n        from here until it has been examined and inventoried.",
                "Jakobsen. It is pay-day, and this is the money for the wages.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Jakobsen is responsible for it, and will account for it.",
                "The Receiver. Oh, that alters the case. Mr. Jakobsen is a man of\n        integrity. (Goes back to his work.)",
                "Jakobsen (to MRS. TJAELDE, in a low voice full of emotion). Did you hear\n        that, Mrs. Tjaelde? He called me a man of integrity -- and very soon\n        not a single soul will call me that! (Goes out past TJAELDE to whom he\n        whispers as he passes:) Scoundrel! I shall come back again!",
                "The Receiver (going up to TJAELDE). Excuse me, but I must ask you for\n        the keys of your private rooms and cupboards.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (answering for her husband). My housekeeper shall go with\n        you. Sannaes, here is the key of the cupboard. (SANNAES takes it from\n        her.)",
                "The Receiver (looking at TJAELDE'S massive watch-chain). Whatever\n        article of dress can be called a necessary, we have nothing to do with;\n        but if it happens that it comrises jewellery of any great value -- .\n        (TJAELDE begins to take off the watch-chain.) No, no; keep it on. But it\n        will have to be included in the inventory.",
                "Tjaelde. I don't wish to keep it.",
                "The Receiver. As you please. (Signs to one of his clerks to take it.)\n        Good-day! (Meanwhile SIGNE and HAMAR have appeared at the door of the\n        outer office, and have seen what passed.

                "Tjaelde (as if waking from a dream). Ah, of course! (Goes to the door\n        and unlocks it.)",
                "Signe (rushing to MRS. TJAELDE and falling on her knees beside her).\n        Mother!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, dear, the day of our trial has come! And I am afraid -- afraid\n        that it may find us all too weak.",
                "Signe. Mother, what is to become of us?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. We are in God's hands.",
                "Signe. I will go with Hamar to his aunt's. We will go at once.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. It is possible that his aunt may not be willing to have\n        you now.",
                "Signe. Aunt Ulla! What do you mean?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. I mean that you have been the rich man's daughter; and you\n        do not know what the world is.",
                "Signe. Hamar, do you think Aunt Ulla would refuse to have me?",
                "Hamar (after a moment's thought). I don't know.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. You hear that, my child. In the next few hours you will\n        learn more than you have learnt in all your life.",
                "Signe (in a horrified whisper). Do you mean that even -- ?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Hush! (SIGNE hides her face in her mother's lap. A loud\n        burst of laughter is heard outside.)",
                "Hamar (going to the nearest window). What is that? (SANNAES comes in\n        through the right-hand door and goes to the other window. TJAELDE, SIGNE\n        and MRS. TJAELDE get up.) The bay horse! They have got hold of it.",
                "Sannaes. They have led it up the steps, and are pretending to sell it by\n        auction.",
                "Hamar. They are ill-treating it! (SANNAES runs out. HAMAR snatches up\n        the revolver from the desk and looks to see if it is loaded.) I will -- !",
                "Signe. What are you going to do? (As he starts to go out, she clings to\n        him and prevents him.)",
                "Hamar. Let me go!",
                "Signe. Tell me first what you are going to do! Do you mean to go out\n        among all those men -- alone?",
                "Hamar. Yes.",
                "Signe (throwing her arms round him). You shan't go!",
                "Hamar. Take care, this is loaded!",
                "Signe. What are you going to do with it?",
                "Hamar (in a determined voice, as he shakes himself free of her). Put a\n        bullet into the poor beast! It is too good for that crew. It shan't be\n        put up for auction, either in joke or in earnest! (Goes to the farther\n        window.) I shall get a better aim from here.",
                "Signe (following him, with a cry). You will hit some one!",
                "Hamar. No, I can aim too well for that. (Takes aim.)",
                "Signe. Father! If they hear a shot from here now --",
                "Tjaelde (starting up). The house belongs to my creditors now -- and\n        the revolver too!",
                "Hamar. No, I am past taking orders from you now! (TJAELDE snatches at\n        the revolver, which goes off. SIGNE screams and rushes to her mother.\n        Outside, but this time immediately below the window, two cries are\n        heard: \"They are shooting at us! They are shooting at us!\" Then the\n        noise of breaking glass is heard, and stones fly in through the windows,\n        followed by shouts and ribald laughter. VALBORG, who has rushed in from\n        the outer office, stands in front of her father to protect him, her face\n        turned to the window. A voice is heard: \"Follow me, my lads!\")",
                "Hamar (pointing the revolver at the window). Yes, just you try it!",

                "Tjaelde. It is Sannaes with the police! (Cries of \"Get back, there!\" are\n        heard; then a renewed uproar and a loud voice gradually dominating it;\n        until at last the noise gradually lessens and ceases.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Thank God! We were in great danger. (Sinks into a chair. A\n        pause.) Henning, where are you? (TJAELDE comes up behind her, and\n        strokes her head with his hand, but turns away immediately to hide his\n        deep emotion. A pause.)",
                "Signe (on her knees by her mother's side). But won't they come back?\n        Hadn't we better go away from here?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Where to?",
                "Signe (despairingly). What is to become of us?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What God wills. (A pause. Meanwhile HAMAR, unobserved, has\n        laid down the revolver on a chair and slipped out of the room by the\n        door at the back.)",
                "Valborg (softly). Signe, look! (SIGNE gets up, looks round the room, and\n        gives a little cry.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What is it?",
                "Signe. I knew he would!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (apprehensively). What is it?",
                "Valborg. Every rich family has its tame lieutenant -- and ours has\n        just left us. That's all.",

                "Signe (in tears). Mother, mother!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Things are better as they are. Do you hear, dear? Don't\n        cry!",
                "Signe. I am not crying! but I feel so ashamed -- oh, so ashamed!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. It is I that ought to feel ashamed for never having had\n        the courage to put a stop to what I saw was folly.",
                "Signe (as before). Mother!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Soon there will be no one else left to desert us; and we\n        shall have nothing left that any one can rob us of, either.",
                "Valborg (comes forward evidently labouring under great emotion). Yes,\n        there is, mother; I mean to desert you.",
                "Signe. You, Valborg? Desert us? You?",
                "Valborg. Our home is going to be broken up, anyway. Each of us ought to\n        shift for herself.",
                "Signe. But what am I to do? I don't know how to do anything.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (who has sunk back into her chair). What a bad mother I\n        must have been, not to be able to keep my children together now!",
                "Valborg (impetuously). You know we cannot stay together now! You know we\n        cannot put up with living on the charity of our creditors; we have done\n        that too long!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Hush, remember your father is in the room. (A pause.) What\n        do you want to do, Valborg?",
                "Valborg (after she has regained her self-control, quietly). I want to go\n        into Mr. Holst's office, and learn commercial work -- and keep\n        myself.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. You don't know what you are undertaking.",
                "Valborg. But I know what I am leaving.",
                "Signe. And I shall only be a burden to you, mother, because I can't do\n        anything --",
                "Valborg. You can! Go out and earn a living; even if it is only as\n        a servant, what does that matter? Don't live on our creditors -- not\n        for a day, not for an hour!",
                "Signe. And what is to become of mother, then?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Your mother will stay with your father.",
                "Signe. But all alone? You, who are so ill?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. No, not alone! Your father and I will be together.\n        (TJAELDE comes forward, kisses the hand she has stretched out to him,\n        and falls on his knees by her chair, burying his face in her lap. She\n        strokes his hair gently.) Forgive your father, children. That is the\n        finest thing you can do. (TJAELDE gets up again and goes back to the\n        other end of the room. A messenger comes in with a letter.)",
                "Signe (turning round anxiously). It is a letter from him! I can't stand\n        any more! I won't have it! (The messenger hands the letter to TJAELDE.)",
                "Tjaelde. I accept no more letters.",
                "Valborg (looking at the letter). It is from Sannaes?",
                "Tjaelde. He, too!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Take it and read it, Valborg. Let us get it all over at\n        once. (VALBORG takes the letter from the messenger, who goes out. She\n        opens the letter, looks at it, and then reads it with emotion.) \"Sir, -- I\n        have owed you everything since I entered your employment as a boy.\n        Therefore do not take what I am going to say amiss. You know that about\n        eight years ago I came into a little legacy. I have used the money to\n        some advantage, having especially looked out for such investments as\n        would not be affected by the uncertainties of high finance. The total\n        sum, which now amounts to about \u00a31400, I beg to offer to you as a token\n        of respectful gratitude; because, in the end, I owe it to you that I\n        have been able to make it that sum. Besides, you will be able to make\n        many times better use of it than I could. If you need me, my dearest\n        wish is to remain with you in the future. Forgive me for having seized\n        just this moment for doing this; I could not do otherwise. -- Your\n        obedient servant, J. SANNAES.\" (While VALBORG has been reading, TJAELDE\n        has come gradually forward, and is now standing beside his wife.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Though out of all those you have helped, Henning, only one\n        comes to your aid at a time like this, you must feel that you have your\n        reward. (TJAELDE nods, and goes to the back of the room again.) And you,\n        children -- do you see how loyally this man, a stranger, is standing\n        by your father? (A pause. SIGNE stands by the desk, crying. TJAELDE\n        walks up and down uneasily at the back of the room once or twice, then\n        goes up the staircase.)",
                "Valborg. I should like to speak to Sannaes.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, do, dear! I couldn't, just now; and I am sure your\n        father couldn't either. You speak to him! (Gets up.) Come, Signe, you\n        and I must have a talk; you must open your heart to me now. -- Ah,\n        when have we ever had a real talk together? (SIGNE goes to her.) Where\n        is your father?",
                "Valborg. He went upstairs.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (leaning on SIGNE's arm). So he did. I am sure he must be\n        longing to rest -- although he won't find it easy to do that. It has\n        been a terrible day; but surely God will turn it to our good! (Goes out\n        with SIGNE. VALBORG goes to the back of the room and rings the bell. A\n        messenger comes.)",
                "Valborg. If Mr. Sannaes is out there, please ask him to be so good as to\n        come in here for a moment. (The messenger goes out.) Perhaps he won't\n        come, when he hears it is I. (Listens.) Yes, he is coming!",
                "(SANNAES comes in, but stops short when he sees VALBORG, and hurriedly\n        puts his hands behind his back.)",
                "Sannaes. Is it you, Miss Valborg, that want me?",
                "Valborg. Please come in. (SANNAES takes a few timid steps forward.\n        VALBORG speaks in a more friendly tone.) Come in, then! (SANNAES comes\n        further into the room.)",
                "Valborg. You have written a letter to my father.",
                "Sannaes (after a moment's pause). Yes.",
                "Valborg. And made him a most generous offer.",
                "Sannaes (as before). Oh, well -- it was only natural that I should.",
                "Valborg. Do you think so? It doesn't seem so to me. It is an offer that\n        honours the man that made it. (A pause.)",
                "Sannaes. I hope he means to accept it?",
                "Valborg. I don't know.",
                "Sannaes (sadly, after a moment's pause). Then he doesn't mean to? No -- I\n        suppose not.",
                "Valborg. I honestly don't know. It depends on whether he dare.",
                "Sannaes. Whether he dare?",
                "Valborg. Yes. (A pause.)",
                "Sannaes (evidently very shy of VALBORG). Have you any more orders for\n        me, Miss Valborg?",
                "Valborg (with a smile). Orders? I am not giving you orders. -- You\n        have offered also to stay with my father for the future.",
                "Sannaes. Yes -- that is to say, if he wishes me to.",
                "Valborg. I don't know. In that case there would be only he and my mother\n        and you; no one else.",
                "Sannaes. Indeed? What about the others, then?",
                "Valborg. I don't know for certain what my sister means to do -- but I\n        am leaving home to-day.",
                "Sannaes. Then you are going to --",
                "Valborg. -- to try and get a clerkship somewhere. So that it will be\n        a bit lonely for you to be in my father's employment now. (A pause.) I\n        expect you had not thought of it in that light?",
                "Sannaes. No -- yes -- that is to say, your father will have all\n        the more need of me then.",
                "Valborg. Indeed he will. But what sort of a prospect is it for you to\n        bind up your fortunes with my father's? The future is so very\n        problematical, you know.",
                "Sannaes. What sort of a prospect -- ?",
                "Valborg. Yes, a young man should have some sort of a prospect before\n        him.",
                "Sannaes. Yes -- of course; that is to say, I only thought that at\n        first it would be so difficult for him.",
                "Valborg. But I am thinking of you. Surely you have some plans for the\n        future?",
                "Sannaes (embarrassed). Really I would rather not talk about myself.",
                "Valborg. But I want to. -- You have something else in reserve, then?",
                "Sannaes. Well -- if I must tell you -- I have some well-to-do\n        relations in America who have for a long time wanted me to go over\n        there. I should soon be able to get, a good situation there.",
                "Valborg. Indeed? -- But why haven't you accepted such a good offer\n        long before this? (SANNAES does not answer.) You must have been\n        sacrificing your best interests by staying so long with us? (SANNAES is\n        still silent.) Any! it will be making a still greater sacrifice to stay\n        with us now --",
                "Sannaes (struggling with his embarrassment). I have never thought of it\n        as being that.",
                "Valborg. But my father can scarcely accept so much from you.",
                "Sannaes (in alarm). Why not?",
                "Valborg. Because it really would be too much. -- And, in any case, I\n        shall try to prevent him.",
                "Sannaes (almost imploringly). You, Miss Valborg?",
                "Valborg. Yes. You must not be misemployed any longer.",
                "Sannaes. Misemployed? In what I myself desire so much?",
                "Valborg. When I have talked it over with my father, I think he will see\n        my point.",
                "Sannaes (anxiously). What do you mean?",
                "Valborg (after a moment's reflection). -- I mean, the reason of your\n        having made such great sacrifices for us -- and of your being willing\n        to make still greater now. (A pause. SANNAES hangs his head, and is\n        raising his hands to hide his face, when suddenly he puts them behind\n        his back again. VALBORG continues, in gentle but firm tones:) I have\n        taught myself, all my life, to look behind deeds and words for their\n        motives.",
                "Sannaes (quietly, without raising his head). You have taught yourself to\n        be cruelly bitter, hard and unjust.",
                "Valborg (starts, but collects herself, and says gently:) Don't say that,\n        Mr. Sannaes! It is not hard-heartedness or bitterness that makes me\n        think of your future now -- and makes me wish to spare you\n        disappointment.",
                "Sannaes (with a cry of pain). Miss Valborg!",
                "Valborg. Be honest with yourself, and you will be able to take a fairer\n        view of what I have just said.",
                "Sannaes. Have you any more orders, Miss Valborg?",
                "Valborg. I give you no orders, as I have told you already. I am only\n        bidding you good-bye; and I do it with grateful thanks to you for all\n        your goodness to me -- and to us all. Good-bye and good luck, Mr.\n        Sannaes. (SANNAES bows.)Won't you shake hands? Ah, I forgot -- I\n        offended you. I beg your pardon for that. (SANNAES bows and turns to\n        go.) Come, Mr. Sannaes -- let us at least part as good friends! You\n        are going to America, and I am going among strangers. Let us go away\n        wishing one another well.",
                "Sannaes (moved). Good-bye, Miss Valborg. (Turns to go.)",
                "Valborg. Mr. Sannaes -- shake hands!",
                "Sannaes (stopping). No, Miss Valborg.",
                "Valborg. Don't treat me uncivilly; I have not deserved that. (SANNAES\n        again turns to go.) Mr. Sannaes!",
                "Sannaes (stopping). You might soil your fingers, Miss Valborg! (Walks\n        proudly away.)",
                "Valborg (controlling herself with an effort). Well, we have offended\n        each other now. But why should we not forgive each other as well?",
                "Sannaes. Because you have just offended me for the second time to-day -- and\n        more deeply than the first time.",
                "Valborg. Oh, this is too much! I spoke as I did, because I owed it to\n        myself not to be put in a false position, and owed it to you to spare\n        you future disappointment. And you call that insulting you! Which of us\n        has insulted the other, I should like to know?",
                "Sannaes. You have, by thinking such things of me. Do you realise how\n        cruelly you have spoilt the happiest action of my life?",
                "Valborg. I have done so quite unintentionally, then. I am only glad that\n        I was mistaken.",
                "Sannes (bitterly). You are glad! So it really makes you glad to know\n        that I am not a scoundrel!",
                "Valborg (quietly). Who said anything of the kind?",
                "Sannaes. You! You know the weak spot in my armour; but that you should\n        on that account believe that I could lay a trap for you and try to trade\n        on your father's misfortune, Miss Valborg -- ! No, I cannot shake\n        hands with any one who has thought so badly of me as that! And, since\n        you have so persistently insulted me that I have lost all the timidity I\n        used to feel in your presence, let me tell you this openly; these hands\n        (stretching out his hands to her) have grown red and ugly in loyal work\n        for your father, and his daughter should have been above mocking at me\n        for them! (Turns to go, but stops.) And, one word more. Ask your father\n        for his hand now, and hold fast to it, instead of deserting him\n        on the very day that misfortune has overtaken him. That would be more to\n        the point than worrying about my future. I can look after that\n        for myself. (Turns again to go, but comes back.) And when, in his\n        service -- which will be no easy service now -- your hands bear\n        the same honourable marks of work as mine do, and are as red as mine,\n        then you will perhaps understand how you have hurt me! At present you\n        cannot. (He goes quickly towards the door of the outer office.)",
                "Valborg (with a wry smile). What a temper! (More seriously.) And yet,\n        after all -- . (Looks after him. Just as SANNAES gets to the door\n        TJAELDE'S voice is heard calling him from the top of the staircase.\n        SANNAES answers him.)",
                "Tjaelde (coming down the stairs). Sannaes! Sannaes! I can see Jakobsen\n        coming. (Hurries across the room as if pursued by fear. SANNAES follows\n        him.) Of course he will be coming back to look for me again! It is\n        cowardly of me to feel that I cannot stand it; but I cannot -- not\n        to-day, not now! I cannot stand any more! Stop him! Don't let him come\n        in! I shall have to drink my cup of misery to the dregs; but (almost in\n        a whisper) not all at one draught! (Hides his face in his hands.)",
                "Sannaes. He shan't come; don't be afraid! (Goes quickly out, with an air\n        of determination.)",
                "Tjaelde. It is hard -- oh, it is hard!",
                "Valborg (coming to his side). Father! (He looks at her, anxiously.) You\n        may safely accept the money Sannaes offers you.",
                "Tjaelde (in surprise). What do you mean by that?",
                "Valborg. I mean -- that, if you do, I will not forsake you either,\n        but stay here with you too.",
                "Tjaelde (incredulously). You, Valborg?",
                "Valborg. Yes, you know I want to learn office work, and business; and I\n        would rather learn in your office.",
                "Tjaelde (shyly). I don't understand what you -- ?",
                "Valborg. Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some\n        use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh -- and\n        try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.",
                "Tjaelde (happily, but shyly). My child! Who put such a happy idea into\n        your head?",
                "Valborg (putting an arm round his neck). Father, forgive me for all that\n        I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!\n        How hard I shall work!",
                "Tjaelde (still half incredulous). My child! My child!",
                "Valborg. I feel -- I cannot tell you how deeply -- a craving for\n        love and for work! (Throws both her arms round his neck.) Oh, father,\n        how I love you! -- and how I shall work for you!",
                "Tjaelde. Ah, that is the Valborg I have waited for, ever since you were\n        a little child! But we had drifted away from one another, somehow.",
                "Valborg. No more about the past! Look forward, father, look forward!\n        Concerns \"that would not be affected by the uncertainties of high\n        finance,\" -- weren't those his words?",
                "Tjaelde. So you were struck by that expression, too?",
                "Valborg. That may mean a future for us now! We will have a home all to\n        ourselves -- a little house down on the shore -- and I shall help\n        you, and Signe will help mother -- we shall know what it is to live,\n        for the first time!",
                "Tjaelde. What happiness it will be!",
                "Valborg. Only look forward, father! Look forward! A united family is\n        invincible!",
                "Tjaelde. And to think that such help should come to me now!",
                "Valborg. Yes, now we are all going to our posts -- and all together,\n        where formerly you stood alone! You will have good fairies round you;\n        wherever you look, you will see happy faces and busy fingers all day\n        long; and we shall all enjoy our meals and our evenings together, just\n        as we did when we were children!",
                "Tjaelde. That, above everything!",
                "Valborg. Ha, ha! -- it is after the rain that the birds sing\n        blithest, you know! And this time our happiness can never miscarry,\n        because we shall have something worth living for!",
                "Tjaelde. Let us go to your mother! This will cheer her heart!",
                "Valborg. Ah, how I have learnt to love her! What has happened to-day has\n        taught me.",
                "Tjaelde. It is for her that we shall all work now.",
                "Valborg. Yes -- for her, for her. She shall rest now. Let us go to\n        her!",
                "Tjaelde. Kiss me first, my dear. (His voice trembles.) It is so long\n        since you did!",
                "Valborg (kissing him). Father!",
                "Tjaelde. Now let us go to your mother. (The curtain falls as they go out\n        together.)"

                "Tjaelde. That's just as well, as you have so much time to admire me now!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Now that I find getting about so difficult, you mean? Ah,\n        that is only my pretence, so as to get you to wheel me about!",
                "Tjaelde (with a sigh). Ah, my dear, it is good of you to take it so\n        cheerfully. But that you should be the only one of us to bear such hard\n        traces of our misfortune --",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (interrupting him). Do you forget your own whitened hair?\n        That is a sign of it, too, but a beautiful one! And, as for my being an\n        invalid, I thank God every day for it! In the first place I have almost\n        no pain, and then it gives me the opportunity to feel how good you are\n        to me in every way.",
                "Tjaelde. You enjoy your life, then?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, indeed I do -- and just as I should wish to.",
                "Tjaelde. Just to be spoiled, and yourself to spoil us?",
                "Valborg (from the window). I have finished the accounts, father.",
                "Tjaelde. Doesn't it come out at about what I said?",
                "Valborg. Almost exactly. Shall I enter it in the ledger at once?",
                "Tjaelde. Oho! You are glad then, as you seem in such it hurry?",
                "Valborg. Certainly! Such a good stroke of business!",
                "Tjaelde. And both you and Sannaes tried your best to dissuade me from\n        it!",
                "Valborg. Such a pair of wiseacres!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Ah, your father is your master, my dear!",
                "Tjaelde. Tjaelde. Oh, it is easy enough to captain a small army that\n        marches on, instead of a big one that is in retreat. (VALBORG goes on\n        with her work.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. And yet it seemed hard enough for us to give it up.",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, yes -- oh, yes. I can tell you, I was thinking of that\n        last night. If God had given me what I begged for then, what state\n        should we have been in now? I was thinking of that, too.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. It is the fact of the estate being at last wound up that\n        has brought all these thoughts into your mind, dear?",
                "Tjaelde. Yes.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Then I must confess that I, too, have scarcely been able\n        to think of anything else since yesterday, when Sannaes went into town\n        to settle it up. This a red-letter day! Signe is wrestling with a little\n        banquet for us; we shall see what an artist she has become! Here she is!",
                "Tjaelde. I think I will just go and look over Valborg's accounts. (Goes\n        to the window. SIGNE comes out of the house, wearing a cook's apron and\n        carrying a basin.)",
                "Signe. Mother, you must taste my soup! (Offers her a spoonful.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Clever girl! (Tastes the soup.) Perhaps it would stand a\n        little -- . No, it is very good as it is. You are clever!",
                "Signe. Am I not! Will Sannaes be back soon?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Your father says we may expect him any moment.",
                "Tjaelde (at the window, to VALBORG). No, wait a moment. I will come in.\n        (Goes into the house, and is seen within the window beside VALBORG.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. My little Signe, I want to ask you something?",
                "Signe. Do you?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What was in the letter you had yesterday evening?",
                "Signe. Aha, I might have guessed that was it! Nothing, mother.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Nothing that pained you, then?",
                "Signe. I slept like a top all night -- so you can judge for yourself.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. I am so glad. But, you know, there seems to me something a\n        little forced in the gay way you say that?",
                "Signe. Does there? Well, it was something that I shall always be ashamed\n        of; that is all.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. I am thankful to hear it, for --",
                "Signe (interrupting her). That must be Sannaes. I hear wheels. Yes, here\n        he is! He has come too soon; dinner won't be ready for half an hour yet.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. That doesn't matter.",
                "Signe. Father, here is Sannaes!",
                "Tjaelde (from within). Good! I will come out! (SIGNE goes into the house\n        as TJAELDE comes out. SANNAES comes in a moment later.)",
                "Tjaelde and Mrs. Tjaelde. Welcome!",
                "Sannaes. Thank you! (Lays down his dust-coat and driving gloves on a\n        chair, and comes forward.)",
                "Tjaelde. Well?",
                "Sannaes. Yes -- your bankruptcy is discharged!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. And the result was -- ?",
                "Sannaes. Just about what we expected.",
                "Tjaelde. And, I suppose, just about what Mr. Berent wrote?",
                "Sannaes. Just about, except for one or two inconsiderable trifles. You\n        can see for yourself. (Gives him a bundle of papers.) The high prices\n        that have ruled of late, and good management, have altered the whole\n        situation.",
                "Tjaelde (who has opened the papers and glanced at the totals). A deficit\n        of \u00a312,000.",
                "Sannaes. I made a declaration on your behalf, that you intended to try\n        and repay that sum, but that you should be at liberty to do it in\n        whatever way you found best. And so --",
                "Tjaelde. And so -- ?",
                "Sannaes. -- I proferred on the spot rather more than half the amount\n        you still owed Jakobsen.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Not really? (TJAELDE takes out a pencil and begins making\n        calculations on the margins of the papers.)",
                "Sannaes. There was general satisfaction -- and they all sent you\n        their cordial congratulations.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. So that, if all goes well --",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, if things go as well with the business as they promise to,\n        Sannaes, in twelve or fourteen years I shall have paid every one in\n        full.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. We haven't much longer than that left to live, dear!",
                "Tjaelde. Then we shall die poor. And I shall not complain!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. No, indeed! The honourable name you will leave to your\n        children will be well worth it.",
                "Tjaelde. And they will inherit a sound business, which they can go on\n        with if they choose.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Did you hear that, Valborg?",
                "Valborg (from the window). Every word! (SANNAES bows to her.) I must go\n        in and tell Signe! (Moves away from the window.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. What did Jakobsen say? -- honest old Jakobsen?",
                "Sannaes. He was very much affected, as you would expect. He will\n        certainly be coming out here to-day.",
                "Tjaelde (looking up from the papers). And Mr. Berent?",
                "Sannaes. He is coming hard on my heels. I was to give you his kind\n        regards and tell you so.",
                "Tjaelde. Splendid! We owe him so much.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes, he has been a true friend to us. But, talking of true\n        friends, I have something particular to ask you, Sannaes.",
                "Sannaes. Me, Mrs. Tjaelde?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. The maid told me that yesterday, when you went into town,\n        you took the greater part of your belongings with you. Is that so?",
                "Sannaes. Yes, Mrs. Tjaelde.",
                "Tjaelde. What does that mean? (To his wife.) You said nothing about it\n        to me, my dear.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Because I thought it might be a misunderstanding. But now\n        I must ask what was the meaning of it. Are you going away?",
                "Sannaes (fingering a chair, in evident confusion). Yes, Mrs. Tjaelde.",
                "Tjaelde. Where to? You never said anything about it.",
                "Sannaes. No; but I have always considered that I should have finished my\n        task here as soon as the estate was finally wound up.",
                "Tjaelde and Mrs. Tjaelde. You mean to leave us?",
                "Sannaes. Yes.",
                "Tjaelde. But why?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Where do you mean to go?",
                "Sannaes. To my relations in America. I can now, without doing you any\n        harm, withdraw my capital from the business by degrees and transfer it\n        abroad.",
                "Tjaelde. And dissolve our partnership?",
                "Sannaes. You know that at any rate you had decided now to resume the old\n        style of the firm's name.",
                "Tjaelde. That is true; but, Sannaes, what does it all mean? What is your\n        reason?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Are you not happy here, where we are all so attached to\n        you?",
                "Tjaelde. You have quite as good a prospect for the future here as in\n        America.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. We held together in evil days; are we not to hold together\n        now that good days have come?",
                "Sannaes. I owe you both so much.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Good heavens, it is we that owe you --",
                "Tjaelde. -- more than we can ever repay. (Reproachfully.) Sannaes!",
                "(SIGNE comes in, having taken off her cooking apron.)",
                "Signe. Congratulations! Congratulations! Father mother! (Kisses them\n        both.) Welcome, Sannaes! -- But aren't you pleased? -- now? (A\n        pause. VALBORG comes in.)",
                "Valborg. What has happened?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Sannaes wants to leave us, my children (A pause.)",
                "Signe. But, Sannaes -- !",
                "Tjaelde. Even if you want to go away, why have you never said a single\n        word to us about it before? (To the others.) Or has he spoken to any of\n        you? (MRS. TJAELDE shakes her head.)",
                "Signe. No.",
                "Sannaes. It was because -- because -- I wanted to be able to go as\n        soon as I had told you. Otherwise it would be too hard to go.",
                "Tjaelde. You must have very serious grounds for it, then! Has anything\n        happened to you to -- to make it necessary? (SANNAES does not\n        answer.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. And to make it impossible for you to trust any of us?",
                "Sannaes (shyly). I thought I had better keep it to myself. (A pause.)",
                "Tjaelde. That makes it still more painful for us -- to think that you\n        could go about in our little home circle here, where you have shared\n        everything with us, carrying the secret of this intention hidden in your\n        heart.",
                "Sannaes. Do not be hard on me! Believe me, if I could stay, I would; and\n        if I could tell you the reason, I would. (A pause.)",
                "Signe (to her mother, in an undertone). Perhaps he wants to get married?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Would his being here with us make any difference to that?\n        Any one that Sannaes loved would be dear to us.",
                "Tjaelde (going up to SANNAES and putting an arm round his shoulders).\n        Tell one of us, then, if you cannot tell us all. Is it nothing we can\n        help you in?",
                "Sannaes. No.",
                "Tjaelde. But can you judge of that alone? One does not always realise\n        how much some one else's advice, on the experience of an older man, may\n        help one.",
                "Sannaes. Unfortunately it is as I say.",
                "Tjaelde. It must be something very painful, then?",
                "Sannaes. Please -- !",
                "Tjaelde. Well, Sannaes, you have quite cast a cloud over to-day's\n        happiness for us. I shall miss you as I have never missed any one.",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. I cannot imagine the house without Sannaes!",
                "Tjaelde (to his wife). Come, dear, shall we go in again?",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. Yes -- it is not nice out here any longer. (TJAELDE\n        takes her into the house. SIGNE turns to VALBORG to go in with her, but\n        when she comes close to her she gives a little cry. VALBORG takes her\n        arm, and their eyes meet.)",
                "Signe. Where have my wits been? (She goes into the house, looking back\n        at VALBORG and SANNAES. The latter is giving way to his emotion, but as\n        soon as his eyes fall on VALBORG he recovers himself.)",
                "Valborg (impetuously). Sannaes!",
                "Sannaes. What are your orders, Miss Valborg?",
                "Valborg (turning away from him, then turning back, but avoiding his\n        eyes). Do you really mean to leave us?",
                "Sannaes. Yes, Miss Valborg. (A pause.)",
                "Valborg. So we shall never stand back to back at our desks in the same\n        room again?",
                "Sannaes. No, Miss Valborg.",
                "Valborg. That is a pity; I had become so accustomed to it.",
                "Sannaes. You will easily become accustomed to some one else's -- back.",
                "Valborg. Ah, some one else is some one else.",
                "Sannaes. You must excuse me, Miss Valborg; I don't feel in the humour\n        for jesting to-day. (Turn to go.)",
                "Valborg (looking up at him). Is this to be our parting, then? (A pause.)",
                "Sannaes. I thought of taking leave of you all this afternoon.",
                "Valborg (taking a step towards him). But ought not we two to settle our\n        accounts first?",
                "Sannaes (coldly). No, Miss Valborg.",
                "Valborg. Do you feel then that everything between us has been just as it\n        ought?",
                "Sannaes. God knows I don't!",
                "Valborg. But you think I am to blame? -- Oh, well, it doesn't matter.",
                "Sannaes. I am quite willing to take the blame. Put anyway, it is all\n        finished with now.",
                "Valborg. But if we were to share the blame? You cannot be quite\n        indifferent as to which of us should take it?",
                "Sannaes. I confess I am not. But, as I said, I do not wish for any\n        settling of accounts between us.",
                "Valborg. But I wish it.",
                "Sannaes. You will have plenty of time to settle it to your own\n        satisfaction.",
                "Valborg. But, if I am in difficulties about it, I cannot do it alone.",
                "Sannaes. I do not think you will find any difficulty.",
                "Valborg. But if I think so? -- if I feel myself deeply\n        wronged?",
                "Sannaes. I have told you that I am willing to take all the blame upon\n        myself.",
                "Valborg. No, Sannaes -- I don't want charity; I want to be\n        understood. I have a question to ask you.",
                "Sannaes. As you will.",
                "Valborg. How was it that we got on so well for the first year after my\n        father's failure-and even longer? Have you ever thought of that?",
                "Sannaes. Yes. I think it was because we never talked about anything but\n        our work -- about business.",
                "Valborg. You were my instructor.",
                "Sannaes. And when you no longer needed an instructor --",
                "Valborg. -- we hardly spoke to one another.",
                "Sannaes (softly). No.",
                "Valborg. Well, what could I say or do, when every sign of friendship on\n        my part went unnoticed?",
                "Sannaes. Unnoticed? Oh no, Miss Valborg, I noticed them.",
                "Valborg. That was my punishment, then!",
                "Sannas. God forbid I should do you an injustice. You had a motive which\n        did you credit; you felt compassion for me, and so you could not help\n        acting as you did. But, Miss Valborg, I refuse your compassion.",
                "Valborg. And suppose it were gratitude?",
                "Sannaes (softly). I dreaded that more than anything else! I had had a\n        warning.",
                "Valborg. You must admit, Sannaes, that all this made you very difficult\n        to deal with!",
                "Sannaes. I quite admit that. But, honestly, you must admit that I\n        had good reason to mistrust an interest in me that sprang from mere\n        gratitude. Had circumstances been different, I should only have bored\n        you cruelly; I knew that quite well. And I had no fancy for being an\n        amusement for your idle hours.",
                "Valborg. How you have mistaken me! -- If you will think of it, surely\n        you must understand how different a girl, who has been accustomed to\n        travel and society, becomes when she has to stay at home and work\n        because it is her duty. She comes to judge men by an altogether\n        different standard, too. The men that she used to think delightful are\n        very likely to appear small in her eyes when it is a question of the\n        demands life makes on ability or courage or self-sacrifice; while the\n        men she used to laugh at are transformed in her eyes into models of what\n        God meant men to be, when she is brought into close contact with them in\n        her father's office. -- Is there anything so surprising in that? (A\n        pause.)",
                "Sannaes. Thank you, at all events, for saying that to me. It has done me\n        good. But you should have said it sooner.",
                "Valborg (emphatically). How could I, when you misjudged everything I did\n        or said? No; it was impossible until mistakes and misunderstandings had\n        driven us so far apart that we could not endure them any longer (Turns\n        away.)",
                "Sannaes. Perhaps you are right. I cannot at once recall all that has\n        happened. If I have been mistaken, I shall by degrees find the knowledge\n        of it a profound comfort. -- You must excuse me, Miss Valborg, I have\n        a number of things to see to. (Turns to go.)",
                "Valborg (anxiously). Sannaes, as you admit that you have judged me\n        unjustly, don't you think you ought at least to give me -- some\n        satisfaction?",
                "Sannaes. You may be certain, Miss Valborg, that when I am balancing our\n        account you shall not suffer any injustice. But I cannot do it now. All\n        I have to do now is to get ready to go.",
                "Valborg. But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished\n        your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of -- and something\n        else that dates farther back than that.",
                "Sannaes. You must feel how painful it is for me to prolong this\n        interview. (Turns to go.)",
                "Valborg. But surely you won't go without setting right something that I\n        am going to beg you to?",
                "Sannas. What is that, Miss Valborg?",
                "Valborg. Something that happened a long time ago.",
                "Sannaes. If it is in my power, I will do what you ask.",
                "Valborg. It is. -- Ever since that day you have never offered to\n        shake hands with me.",
                "Sannaes. Have you really noticed that? (A pause.)",
                "Valborg (with a smile, turning away). Will you do so now?",
                "Sannaes (stepping nearer to her). Is this more than a mere whim?",
                "Valborg (concealing her emotion). How can you ask such a question now?",
                "Sannaes. Because all this time you have never once asked me to shake\n        hands with you.",
                "Valborg. I wanted you to offer me your hand. (A pause.)",
                "Sannaes. Are you serious for once?",
                "Valborg. I mean it, seriously.",
                "Sannaes (in a happier voice). You really set a value on it?",
                "Valborg. A great value.",
                "Sannaes (going up to her). Here it is, then!",
                "Valborg (turning and taking his hand). I accept the hand you offer me.",
                "Sannaes (turning pale). What do you mean?",
                "Valborg. I mean that for some time past I have known that I should be\n        proud to be the wife of a man who has loved me, and me alone, ever since\n        he was a boy, and has saved my father and us all.",
                "Sannaes. Oh, Miss Valborg!",
                "Valborg. And you wanted to go away, rather than offer me your hand; and\n        that, only because we had accepted help from you -- and you did not\n        think we were free agents! That was too much; and, as you would not\n        speak, I had to!",
                "Sannaes (kneeling to her). Miss Valborg!",
                "Valborg. You have the most loyal nature, the most delicate mind, and the\n        warmest heart I have ever known.",
                "Sannaes. This is a thousand times too much!",
                "Valborg. Next to God, I have to thank you that I have become what I am;\n        and I feel that I can offer you a life's devotion such as you would\n        rarely find in this world.",
                "Sannaes. I cannot answer because I scarcely realise what you are saying.\n        But you are saying it because you are sorry for me, now that I have to\n        go away, and feel that you owe me some gratitude. (Takes both her hand\n        in his.) Let me speak! I know the truth better than you, and have\n        thought over it far more than you. You are so immeasurably above me in\n        ability, in education, in manners -- and a wife should not be able to\n        look down on her husband. At all events, I am too proud to be willing to\n        be exposed to that. No, what you are feeling now is only the result of\n        your beautiful nature, and the recollection of it will hallow all my\n        life. All the pain and all the happiness I have known have come from\n        you. Your life will be one of self-renunciation; but, God knows there\n        are many such! And my burden will be lightened now, because I shall know\n        that your good wishes will always be with me. (Gets up.) But part we\n        must -- and now more than ever! For I could not bear to be near you\n        unless you were mine, and to make you mine would only mean misery for us\n        both after a little while!",
                "Valborg. Sannaes -- !",
                "Sannaes (holding her hands and interrupting her). I entreat you not to\n        say anything more! You have too much power over me; do not use it to\n        make me sin! For it would be that -- a great sin -- to put two\n        honest hearts into a false position, where they would distress one\n        another, even perhaps get to hate one another.",
                "Valborg. But let me --",
                "Sannas (letting go her hands and stepping back). No, you must not tempt\n        me. Life with you would mean perpetual anxiety, for I should never feel\n        equal to what it would demand of me! But now I can part from you\n        comforted. There will be no bitterness in my heart now; and by degrees\n        all my thoughts of the past and of you will turn to sweetness. God bless\n        you! May every good fortune go with you! Good-bye! (Goes quickly towards\n        the house.)",
                "Valborg. Sannaes! (Follows him.) Sannaes! Listen to me! (SANNAES takes\n        up his coat and gloves, and, as he rushes out without looking where he\n        is going, runs full tilt into BERENT who comes in at that moment\n        followed by JAKOBSEN.)",
                "Sannaes. I beg your pardon! (Rushes out to the right.)",
                "Berent. Are you two playing a game of blind man's buff?",
                "Valborg. God knows we are!",
                "Berent. You need not be so emphatic about it! I have had forcible\n        evidence of it. (Rubs his stomach and laughs.)",
                "Valborg. You must excuse me! Father is in there. (Points to the left and\n        goes hurriedly out to the right.)",
                "Berent. We don't seem to be getting a particularly polite reception!",
                "Jakobsen. No, we seem to be rather in the way, Mr. Berent.",
                "Berent (laughing). It looks like it. But what has been going on?",
                "Jakobsen. I don't know. They looked as if they had been fighting, their\n        faces were so flushed.",
                "Berent. They looked upset, you mean?",
                "Jakobsen. Yes, that's it. Ah, here is Mr. Tjaelde! (To himself.) Good\n        Lord, how aged he looks! (Withdraws into the background as BERENT goes\n        forward to greet TJAELDE, who comes in.)",
                "Tjaelde (to BERENT). I am delighted to see you! You are always welcome\n        in our little home -- and this year more welcome than ever!",
                "Berent. Because things are going better than ever this year! I\n        congratulate you on your discharge -- and also on your determination\n        to pay everything in full!",
                "Tjaelde. Yes, if God wills, I mean to --",
                "Berent. Well, things are going splendidly, aren't they?",
                "Tjaelde. So far, yes.",
                "Berent. You are over the worst of it, now that you have laid the\n        foundations of a new business and laid them solidly.",
                "Tjaelde. One of the things that have given me the greatest encouragement\n        has been the fact that I have won your confidence -- and that has\n        gained me the confidence of others.",
                "Berent. I could have done nothing unless you had first of all done\n        everything. But don't let us say any more about it! -- Well, the\n        place looks even prettier than it did last year.",
                "Tjaelde. We do a little more to it each year, you know.",
                "Berent. And you are still all together here?",
                "Tjaelde. So far, yes.",
                "Berent. Ah, by the way, I can give you news of your deserter. (TJAELDE\n        looks surprised.) I mean your lieutenant!",
                "Tjaelde. Oh -- of him! Have you seen him?",
                "Berent. I was on the same boat coming here. There was a very rich girl\n        on board.",
                "Tjaelde (laughing). Oh, I see!",
                "Berent. All the same, I don't think it came to any thing. It is rather\n        like coming upon a herd of deer when you are stalking; after your first\n        shot, you don't find it so easy to get another; they have grown wary!",
                "Jakobsen (who during this conversation has been screwing up his courage\n        to address TJAELDE). I -- I am a pig, I am! I know that!",
                "Tjaelde (taking his hand). Oh, come, Jakobsen -- !",
                "Jakobsen. A great blundering pig! -- But I know it now!",
                "Tjaelde. That's all right! I can tell you I am delighted to be able to\n        set affairs straight between you and me.",
                "Jakobsen. I don't know what to answer. It goes to my heart! (Shakes his\n        hand heartily.) You are a far better man than I, -- and I said so to\n        my wife. \"He's a splendid fellow,\" I said.",
                "Tjaelde (releasing his hand). Let us forget everything except the happy\n        days we have had together, Jakobsen! How do things go at the Brewery?",
                "Jakobsen. At the Brewery! As long as folk ladle beer into their stomachs\n        at the rate they do now --",
                "Berent. Jakobsen was kind enough to drive me out here. We had a most\n        amusing drive. He is a character.",
                "Jakobsen (in an anxious undertone, to TJAELDE). What does he mean by\n        that?",
                "Tjaelde. That you are different from most people.",
                "Jakobsen. Ah! -- I didn't feel sure, you know, whether he wasn't\n        sitting there making game of me, all the way here.",
                "Tjaelde. How can you think such a thing? (To BERENT.) Do come into the\n        house. Excuse my going first; but my wife is not always quite prepared\n        to receive visitors since she has been able to do so little for herself.\n        (Goes into the house.)",
                "Berent. I don't think Mr. Tjaelde seems to me to be looking in quite as\n        good form as I expected?",
                "Jakobsen. Don't you? I didn't notice anything.",
                "Berent. Perhaps I am mistaken. I think he meant us to follow him in,\n        didn't he?",
                "Jakobsen. So I understood.",
                "Berent. Then, as you have brought me so far, you must take me in to Mrs.\n        Tjaelde.",
                "Jakobsen. I am quite at your service, sir. I have the deepest respect\n        for Mrs. Tjaelde -- (hurriedly) -- and of course for Mr. Tjaelde\n        too. Of course.",
                "Berent. Yes. Well, let us go in.",
                "Jakobsen. Let us go in. (He tries anxiously to keep in step with\n        BERENT'S peculiar walk, but finds it difficult.)",
                "Berent. I think you had better not try. My step suits very few.",
                "Jakobsen. Oh, I shall manage -- ! (They go out to the left. SANNAES\n        comes hurriedly in from the right, and crosses the stage; looks around;\n        then comes across to the foreground and leans with his back against a\n        tree. VALBORG comes in a moment later, comes forward, sees him, and\n        laughs.)",
                "Sannaes. There, you see, Miss Valborg; you are laughing at me.",
                "Valborg. I don't know whether I want to laugh or to cry.",
                "Sannaes. Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You\n        don't see things as plainly as I do.",
                "Valborg. Which of us was it that was mistaken to-day? -- and had to\n        beg pardon for it?",
                "Sannaes. It was I, I know. But this is impossible! A real union of\n        hearts needs to be founded on more than respect --",
                "Valborg (laughing). On love?",
                "Sannaes. You misunderstand me. Could you go into society with me without\n        feeling embarrassed? (VALBORG laughs.) You see, the mere idea of it\n        makes you laugh.",
                "Valborg (laughing). I am laughing because you are magnifying the least\n        important part of it into the most important.",
                "Sannaes. You know how awkward and shy -- in fact downright frightened\n        I am amongst those who -- . (VALBORG laughs again.) There, you see -- you\n        can't help laughing at the idea!",
                "Valborg. I should perhaps even laugh at you when we were in society\n        together! (Laughs.)",
                "Sannaes (seriously). But I should suffer horribly if you did.",
                "Valborg. Believe me, Sannaes, I love you well enough to be able to\n        afford to have a little laugh sometimes at your little imperfections.\n        Indeed, I often do! And suppose we were out in society, and I saw you\n        weighed down under the necessity for pretty manners that do not come\n        easy to you; if I did laugh at you, do you think there would be any\n        unkindness behind my laughter? If others laughed at you, do you suppose\n        I would not, the very next moment, take your arm and walk proudly down\n        the room with you? I know what you really are, and others know it too!\n        Thank God it is not only bad deeds that are known to others in this\n        world!",
                "Sannaes. Your words intoxicate me and carry me off my feet!",
                "Valborg (earnestly). If you think I am only flattering you, let us put\n        it to the test. Mr. Berent is here. He moves in the very best society,\n        but he is superior to its littlenesses. Shall we take his opinion?\n        Without betraying anything, I could make him give it in a moment.",
                "Sannaes (carried away). I want no one's opinion but yours!",
                "Valborg. That's right! If only you feel certain of my love --",
                "Sannaes (impetuously). -- then nothing else will seem to matter; and\n        that alone will be able to teach me all that I lack, in a very short\n        time.",
                "Valborg. Look into my eyes!",
                "Sannaes (taking her hands). Yes!",
                "Valborg. Do you believe that nothing would ever make me ashamed of you!",
                "Sannaes. Yes, I believe that.",
                "Valborg (with emotion). Do you believe that I love you?",
                "Sannaes. Yes! (Falls on one knee.)",
                "Valborg. Deeply enough for my love to last all our lives --",
                "Sannaes. Yes, yes!",
                "Valborg. Then stay with me; and we will look after the old folk -- and\n        replace them when, in God's good time, they are taken from us. (SANNAES\n        bursts into tears. TJAELDE, who has come to the window to show BERENT\n        his ledgers, happens to look up and sees VALBORG and SANNAES.)",
                "Tjaelde (leaning out of the window, and speaking gently:) Valborg, what\n        has happened?",
                "Valborg (quietly). Only that Sannaes and I are engaged to be married.",
                "Tjaelde. Is it possible! (To BERENT, who is immersed in the accounts.)\n        Excuse me! (Hurries away from the window.)",
                "Sannaes (who, in his emotion has heard nothing). Forgive me! It has been\n        such a long, hard struggle -- and I feel overwhelmed!",
                "Valborg. Let us go in to my mother.",
                "Sannws (shrinking back). I can't, Miss Valborg -- you must wait a\n        little --",
                "Valborg. Here they come. (TJAELDE comes in wheeling MRS. TJAELDE in her\n        chair. VALBORG runs to her mother and throws herself into her arms.)",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (softly). God be praised and thanked!",
                "Tjaelde (going up to SANNAES and embracing him). My son!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. So that was why Sannaes wanted to go away! Oh, Sannaes!\n        (TJAELDE brings SANNAES up to her. SANNAES kneels and kisses her hand,\n        then gets up and goes into the background, to recover himself. SIGNE\n        comes in.)",
                "Signe. Mother, everything is ready now!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde. So are things out here!",
                "Signe (looking round). Not really?",
                "Valborg (to SIGNE). Forgive me for never having told you!",
                "Signe. You certainly kept your secret well!",
                "Valborg. I kept long years of suffering secret -- that was all!\n        (SIGNE kisses her and whispers to her; then turns to SANNAES.)",
                "Signe. Sannaes! (Shakes his hand.) So we are to be brother and\n        sister-in-law?",
                "Sannaes (embarrassed). Oh, Miss Signe --",
                "Signe. But you mustn't call me Miss Signe now, you know!",
                "Valborg. You must expect that! He calls me \"Miss\" Valborg still!",
                "Singe. Well, he won't be able to do that when you are married, anyway!",
                "Mrs. Tjaelde (to TJAELDE). But where are our friends?",
                "Tjaelde. Mr. Berent is in the office. There he is, at the window.",
                "Berent (at the window). Now I am coming straight out to congratulate\n        you, with my friend Jakobsen. (Comes out.)",
                "Valborg (going to TJAELDE). Father!",
                "Tjaelde. My child!",
                "Valborg. If we had not known those bad days we should never have known\n        this happy one! (He gives her a grip of the hand.)",
                "Tjaelde (to BERENT). Allow me to present to you my daughter Valborg's\n        fianc\u00e9 -- Mr. Sannaes.",
                "Berent. I congratulate you on your choice, Miss Valborg -- and I\n        congratulate the whole family on such a son-in-law.",

                "Jakobsen. May I too, though I am only a stupid sort of chap, say that\n        this lad has been in love with you ever since he was in his teens -- he\n        hardly could be sooner than that. But I can tell you, honestly, I should\n        never have credited you with having so much sense as to take him. (All\n        laugh.)",

A meeting of the\n        shareholders of a railway company is in progress. Facing the platform\n        are seated the gentry; the common herd, mainly farmers and work-people,\n        are sitting and standing about wherever they can find room. On the\n        right, large windows are standing open; through these another crowd can\n        be seen, listening from outside. GRAN is standing in front of the\n        platform, speaking to the meeting.)",
                "Gran. And, as it was found impossible for the main line of the railway\n        to touch our town, we determined, rather than allow all our exertions to\n        be wasted, to construct a branch line on our own account. I had the\n        honour to be elected chairman of the board of directors of this\n        undertaking. No directors ever had more unrestricted powers than were\n        given to us -- possibly because there were no two opinions as to the\n        route the line should take the natural formation of the ground indicated\n        it unmistakably. It was only when we approached the question of the\n        purchase of our rolling-stock that any dissension arose -- not among\n        the directors, but among the shareholders. As the majority of the latter\n        are farmers and work-people, we had decided on buying only one class of\n        railway carriage of a type slightly more comfortable than the ordinary\n        third-class carriage. That is the extent of our misdeeds! To-day's\n        meeting will probably show what the general sense on the matter is. Our\n        powers being unlimited, we were under no obligation to consult any one\n        in the matter; but, notwithstanding that, we decided to call a meeting\n        of the shareholders and submit the question to them. And, on the\n        directors' behalf, I must thank the shareholders for having attended in\n        such numbers; young and old, men and women, I dare say quite a third of\n        the total number of shareholders are present. The meeting will now\n        proceed to elect a chairman. (Sits down.)",
                "The Mayor (after a pause). I beg to move that Mr. Koll, our chief\n        magistrate, whom it is a great pleasure to see honouring this meeting\n        with his presence, have the further kindness to take the chair.",
                "Gran. The motion before the meeting is that the Chief Magistrate shall\n        take the chair. Shall I assume it to be carried? (Silence follows.)",
                "The Mayor. Yes. (Laughter.)",

                "The Priest. All authority springs from on high. Obedience to those set\n        in authority over us is obedience to the Almighty. But it is against\n        this very obedience that people are rebelling nowadays.",
                "Gran. It is precisely some one to be in authority over us that we want\n        to elect. At present we have no one.",
                "The Priest. No, that's just it. Every meeting nowadays seems to claim\n        authority on its own account. Let rather show our respect to actual\n        authority -- such respect as we would show to our fathers. (Sits\n        down.)",

But even the fact of voting at a railway meeting does not\n        seem to me to be in accordance with the humility and modesty that both\n        Nature and the Scriptures indicate as characteristic of woman. I believe\n        it to be the first step on a wrong road. The apostle says --",

Laughter.) Carried unanimously, that the Priest do\n        not address the meeting. (The PRIEST sits down.) Mr. Gran will address\n        the meeting.",

                "Koll. The Mayor will address the meeting.",
                "The Mayor. I am one of many to whom this proposal of the directors seems\n        extraordinary, to say the least of it. Do they propose that the ladies\n        of my family -- I will leave myself out of the question, for as a\n        public man I have to rub shoulders with all sorts of people -- do\n        they propose, I say, that ladies who have been delicately brought up\n        shall travel with any Tom, Dick and Harry? -- perhaps with convicts\n        being conveyed to gaol, or with journeymen labourers? Is his honour the\n        Chief Magistrate, who is a Commander of a noble Order of Knighthood, to\n        travel side by side with a drunken navvy? Supposing the King were to pay\n        a visit to this beautiful district, which has acquired such a reputation\n        since so many of the best people from town have taken villas here; is\n        his Majesty to make the journey in one of these third-class carriages,\n        with the chance of travelling in company with tradesman stinking of\n        stale cheese? -- with folk who, moreover -- well, perhaps in\n        common decency I ought not to go on, as ladies are present. (Laughter.)\n        \"Economy,\" I hear some one suggest. That word is in great favour\n        nowadays. But I should like to know what economy there is getting your\n        clothes soiled? (Laughter.) Does a first-class carriage wear out sooner\n        than a third class? It costs more to build, no doubt, but that is soon\n        made up by the higher fares charged. I can discover no reasonable ground\n        for this proposal, look at it how you will from the commercial point of\n        view. One has to look at the political aspect of the matter, to\n        understand it; and I am reluctant to drag in politics. I will only say,\n        in conclusion, that it must be those who have framed this proposal that\n        expect to derive some profit from it; the railway certainly would derive\n        none. (Sits down.)",
                "Koll. That last remark was a little like an accusation --",
                "The Mayor (getting up). I only alluded to what is in every one's mind.\n        (Sits down.)",
                "Koll. A speaker is not in order in making accusations, even though they\n        be assumed to be in every one's mind. -- I see that Mr. Alstad wishes\n        to speak.",
                "Alstad. Human nature is frail. That seems to me a sufficient explanation\n        of how such a proposal came to be laid before us. But honestly -- for\n        we all ought to be honest! -- it seems to me that any material\n        advantage it might bring would be more than counterbalanced by loss of\n        esteem. (Uproar.) There has been quite a different spirit in the place\n        of late years -- what with the factories, and the stranger workmen,\n        and the summer visitors. We never used to have so much unrest or to hear\n        so much of this talk about \"equality.\" And now, if we are to give the\n        impression that there is only one social class here -- and that a\n        third class -- I know that I shall be by no means alone in feeling\n        offended. We certainly don't want to sit on our work-people's laps; and,\n        equally, we don't want to have them sitting on ours. (Sits down.)",
                "Gran. Our friend the Mayor is very fond of talking of his loyalty; but I\n        must say I am surprised at his dragging the King even into this matter.\n        As for the matter of the railway carriage in which one of so high degree\n        would travel here -- well, if our carriages are not good enough,\n        surely his Majesty's private saloon can be used on our line as well as\n        on the main line. And as for any of us ordinary mortals who are afraid\n        of mixing with the common herd, surely they can sit together in\n        carriages by themselves. The carriages would be separate; they would\n        only be of the same kind. I think there would be little fear of their\n        being exposed to intrusion on the part of our country-folk. They\n        are much more apt to be more timidly shy than is even desirable. On all\n        small lines -- even on many of the bigger ones -- it is the less\n        luxurious carriages, the second and third class, that for the cost of\n        the more luxurious ones; it is the third class that pays for the first.\n        But that some passengers should travel comfortably at the expense of\n        those who travel less comfortably, is what we wish to avoid. (Applause.)\n        An old resident of the yeoman class has reproached us with wishing to\n        alter our customs. Well, if one of our old customs is the aristocratic\n        one which makes the gulf that separates masters and men wider than it\n        already is, all I can say is that the sooner it is abolished the better;\n        for it is not a good custom; it is even a dangerous one. (Murmurs.) And\n        as for the political aspect of the question --",
                "Koll. Don't you think we should leave politics out of the question?",
                "Gran (bows, with a laugh). That is just what I was going to say, Mr.\n        Chairman; that we ought to leave politics out out of the question. (Sits\n        down, amidst laughter applause. The audience, first the younger men and\n        then the older farmers, begin arguing the matter with one another, more\n        and more loudly.)",
                "Koll. I must beg the meeting to keep quiet, as long as this business is\n        under discussion. The Mayor wishes to speak.",
                "The Mayor. I admit that I am loyal --",
                "Koll. Those people outside must be quiet!",
                "Alstad (going to the window). You must keep quiet!",
                "The Mayor. I admit I am loyal! I count it a point of honour, as a native\n        of the place, to show his Majesty that our first thought when we planned\n        this railway was, at that important moment, that his Majesty might\n        possibly be pleased to manifest a desire to pay us a visit. \"Let him use\n        his own private saloon,\" we are told! No, Mr. Chairman, that is not the\n        way to speak when we are speaking of his Majesty! And what about his\n        Majesty's suite? Are they to travel third class? What I say is that we\n        are casting a slight on his Majesty if we cast a slight on his railway\n        carriage -- I should say, on his suite. And I go farther than that. I\n        say that his Majesty's functionaries are his Majesty's representatives,\n        and that it is casting an additional slight upon his Majesty not to show\n        a proper respect for them. I know that this jars upon the ears of many\n        present; they do not consider that a man who holds a public office\n        should be shown any more respect than any one else. The majority rules,\n        and the majority only thinks of its own interests and those of its\n        servile supporters. But even in this community of ours there is a\n        minority that bears the burden of its affairs and represents its honour;\n        and we will never consent to be dragged down into the mire of this\n        \"equality\" into which you want to plunge each and every one of us!\n        (Uproar.)",
                "Koll. The honourable speaker appears to me to be trenching upon politics --",
                "The Mayor. Possibly I am, Mr. Chairman; but what honest man can shirk\n        the truth? Only compare the present state of things in this community\n        with what was the case when everything here was as it should be; when\n        the King and his officials were respected; when public affairs were in\n        the hands of those who knew how to direct them; when we used to have\n        singing competitions, shooting competitions, and other festal meetings\n        of that kind. And -- yes -- well -- compare, I say, the\n        conditions in those days with our conditions to-day -- that is to\n        say, with all this talk of \"the people;\" as, for instance --",
                "Koll. It is railway carriages that we are discussing.",
                "The Mayor. Quite so! But what is it that is at the bottom of this\n        proposal, Mr. Chairman? Does it not spring from that passion for\n        destruction, for a universal levelling which aims at abolishing the\n        monarchy, at destroying authority --",
                "The Priest. And the Church too, my friend!",
                "The Mayor. -- and the Church, it is quite true! Yes, it is because\n        they desire the Church and --",

                "Alstad (getting up). The question before the meeting is itself a small\n        matter; but it is the consequences of it that I fear. We may expect any\n        proposal of the same kidney now. Never let it be said that our community\n        was eager to range itself under this banner of \"equality!\" It bears too\n        old and honoured a name for that! But there is one thing I want to say.\n        We have always, before this, felt it an honour and a privilege to have\n        the richest man in these parts living amongst us. But when we see him\n        one of the most eager in support of a \"popular\" proposal of this sort,\n        then it appears, to me at all events, to be absolutely unaccountable how -- oh,\n        well, I won't run the risk making what our chairman calls \"accusations\";\n        I will sit down and hold my tongue. I have the right to do that at all\n        events. (Sits down.)",

                "Gran. The plan that we are proposing is no new one. It has been in\n        practice for a long time. In America --",
                "The Priest, Alstad, and others. Yes, in America!",
                "The Mayor (getting up). Mr. Chairman, are we to have politics, after\n        all?",
                "Koll. I cannot see that to mention America is to talk politics.",
                "The Mayor. Then what is politics, if America isn't?",
                "Koll. To talk politics is -- for instance -- to use the arguments\n        your worship did. Mr. Gran will proceed.",

To\n        reconcile both parties I should like to make the following suggestion.\n        Build the carriages, as is often done, in two stories. Then those who\n        wish to ensure their privacy can do so by sitting upstairs; and the\n        others will be satisfied too, because they will all be in the same\n        carriage after all. (Loud laughter.)",

                "Gran. But it was public opinion we were talking about, Flink; is it very\n        much like what we heard to-day?",
                "Flink. I wouldn't say that; your opinions are rather advanced in these\n        parts.",
                "The King. Is the tendency republican, rather than monarchical?",
                "Flink. That depends how you look at it. The King has just been paying\n        some visits in the country districts; he is, so to speak, the commercial\n        traveller for his firm -- as all kings and crown princes are. Of\n        course he was cheered everywhere. But go and ask the agricultural\n        classes if they set great store by the pomp and circumstance of royalty;\n        they will unanimously answer: \"It costs an infernal lot to keep up!\" Ha,\n        ha, ha!",

                "Koll. Letters from their relations in America.",

                "Flink (shrugging his shoulders). It would be the last sensation left for\n        him to try.",
                "The King (who did not observe his shrug, eagerly). That is so, isn't it?\n        You agree with me as to that? I am delighted to have had this talk with\n        you, Mr. Flink.",
                "Flink. The same to you, Mr. -- Mr. -- . (In an undertone, to\n        KOLL.) Is he a republican?",

                "Flink (who has got up and gone to the table on the other side to get a\n        pipe). He simply would not be allowed to, poor chap! What is monarchy, I\n        ask you? Nothing more or less than an insurance business in which a\n        whole crew of priests, officials, noblemen, landed proprietors,\n        merchants and military men hold shares? And, goodness knows, they\n        are not going to give their director leave to commit any such folly! Ha,\n        ha, ha!",
                "The King (getting up). Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Flink (vociferously, to him). Don't you think that is true?",
                "The King. Good Lord! -- perfectly true! Ha, ha ha!",
                "Flink (who has cleaned and filled a pipe, but forgotten to light it,\n        going up to the KING). And what do they insure themselves again, these\n        beauties? (More seriously.) Against the great mass of the people -- against\n        his people! (The KING looks at him and makes a movement of\n        dislike.)",
                "Gran. Look here, Flink; suppose we go out into the garden for a little?\n        These spring evenings are so lovely.",
                "Flink. Compared to a political talk, the loveliest spring evenings have\n        no attraction for me -- no more than warm water, offered me in place\n        of fine cooling wine, would have. No, let us stay where we are. What is\n        the matter with this pipe? (ANNA signs that she will put it right for\n        him, but he does not understand.)",
                "Gran. Give her your pipe; she will put it right.",
                "Koll. What I have always said is that, if the King had an opportunity of\n        understanding the situation, he would interfere.",
                "Flink. The King? He doesn't care a brass farthing about the whole\n        matter! He has something else to do! Ha, ha!",
                "The King. Ha, ha, ha!",
                "Koll. The King is an unusually gifted man; he would not remain\n        indifferent in the long run.",
                "Flink. He has so many unusual gifts that have gone to the devil -- !",
                "The King. Tralalla! Tralalalalala! Tralala! It feels quite odd to be\n        with you fellows again! (Drinks.)",
                "Flink (in an undertone, to GRAN). Is he drunk?",
                "The King (sitting down). Give me a cigar -- ! And let us discuss the\n        matter a little more seriously. (KOLL and GRAN sit down.)",
                "Gran. As a matter of fact, it is not a thing that can be discussed. It\n        must be tried. If, one day, the King were to say: \"I mean to live a\n        natural life among my people, and to withdraw my name from the\n        old-established royal firm, which has lost all its reputation for\n        honesty\" -- that day everything else would follow of itself.",
                "Flink. Yes, that day, I dare say!",
                "Gran. Remember you are the guest of a man who is a friend of the King's!",
                "The King. Don't play the domestic despot -- you who are a republican!\n        Let us have free discussion!",
                "Flink. I certainly don't intend to insult the King. He has never done me\n        any harm. But surely you will allow me to doubt whether he is really the\n        shining light you make him out to be?",
                "The King. That is true enough!",
                "Flink (eagerly). You agree with me as to that, then?",
                "The King. Absolutely! But -- leaving him out of the question -- suppose\n        we had a king who made himself independent of others, and, as a\n        necessary consequence, rose superior to questions of party -- ?",
                "Flink (interrupting him). It is a vain supposition, my dear fellow! A\n        king bound to no party? (Puffs at his pipe.) It wouldn't work! (Puffs\n        again.) It wouldn't work! -- It wouldn't work! -- Falsehood is the\n        foundation of constitutional monarchy. A king superior to questions of\n        party? Rubbish!",
                "Gran. It would be expecting something superhuman of him, too.",
                "Flink. Of course it would!",
                "The King. But the president of a republic is even less independent of\n        party, isn't he?",
                "Flink (turning to hint). He doesn't make any pretence that he isn't.\n        Haha! That's the difference! (Comes forward, repeating to himself.) It\n        is the falsehood that makes the difference.",
                "Koll. Oh, there are falsehoods enough in republics too, unfortunately!",
                "Flink. I know; but they are not old-established institutions! Ha, ha!",
                "The King. That is an idea you have got from Professor Ernst's writings.",
                "Flink (eagerly). Have you read them?",
                "The King. I have scarcely read anything else for the last few months.\n        (KOLL and GRAN exchange glances.)",
                "Flink. Indeed? -- Then there is no need for me to say anything more.",
                "Koll. But, after all this talk, we have got no further. Our friend\n        (pointing to the KING) wants to know, I think, whether a real, serious\n        attempt at what one might call \"democratic monarchy\" could not reckon on\n        being understood and supported --",
                "The King (breaking in, eagerly). Yes, that's just it!",
                "Koll. -- understood and supported by the most enlightened section of\n        the people, who are weary of falsehood and long for a generous but\n        secure measure of self-government.",
                "The King. That's just it!",
                "Flink (who was just going to sit down, jumps up again, lays down his\n        pipe and stands with arms akimbo, as he says:) But what sort of\n        ridiculous ideas are these? Aren't you republicans, then?",
                "Koll. I am not.",
                "Gran. I am; but that does not prevent my being of opinion that the\n        change of government should be made gradually and gently --",
                "Flink. That would be treason!",
                "Gran. Treason!",
                "Flink. Treason against the truth -- against our convictions!",
                "Koll. Don't let us use big words! Monarchy is strongly rooted in the\n        existing order of things.",
                "Flink (with a laugh). In the insurance company!",
                "Koll. Well, call it so if you like. It exists; that is the point.\n        And, since it exists, we must make it as honest and as serviceable as we\n        can.",
                "The King. Your health, Koll! (Drinks to him.)",
                "Flink (moving away from them). No true republican would agree with you.",
                "Gran. You are wrong there. (FLINK gives a start of surprise.)",
                "The King (who has seen FLINK's surprise, gets up). Listen to me! Suppose\n        we had a king who said: \"Either you help me to establish a democratic\n        monarchy -- purged of all traces of absolutism, purged of falsehood -- or\n        else I abdicate -- \"",
                "Flink. Bah!",
                "The King. I only say, \"suppose\"! You know quite well that the cousin of\n        the present king, the heir apparent, is a bigoted --",
                "Koll (who has been exchanging glances with GRAN while the KING was\n        speaking, breaks in hurriedly). Don't go on!",
                "The King (with a laugh). I won't! -- And his mother, who rules him --",
                "Flink. -- is even worse!",
                "The King. What would be your choice, then? Would you help the king to\n        establish a democratic monarchy or -- ?",
                "Flink (impetuously). I would ten thousand times rather have the bigoted\n        prince, with all his own and his mother's follies! -- the madder the\n        better!",
                "Gran. No, no, no, no!",
                "The King (to GRAN and KOLL). We see his true colours now! (Moves away\n        from them.)",
                "Koll (to FLINK). That is the way you republicans always ride your\n        principles to death.",
                "Gran. Patriotism ought to come before --",
                "Flink. -- before truth? No; a short sharp pang of agony is better\n        than endless doubt and falsehood, my friend! That is true patriotism.",
                "Koll. Oh, these theories! -- these phrases!",
                "Gran. I am a republican as well as you, and, I think, as sincere a one.\n        But I should have no hesitation --",
                "Flink. -- in playing the traitor?",
                "Gran. Why do you use such words as that?",
                "Flink. Words! Do you think it is nothing but words? No, my friend, if\n        you did what -- what I did not allow you to say -- I should come\n        here one day to call you to account. And if you refused to fight me, I\n        should shoot you like a dog!",
                "Gran (gently). You would not do that.",
                "Flink (heatedly). Not do it? -- Have I given you the deepest\n        affection of which my heart is capable, only for you to turn traitor to\n        it? Am I to see the man whose character is the crowning achievement of\n        my life, betraying our cause -- and, by reason of his great personal\n        prestige, dragging thousands down with him? On the head of all the\n        disillusionments I have suffered, am I to have this one in the evening\n        of my life -- ? (Stops, overcome by his emotion. A pause.) You\n        shouldn't jest about such things you know. (Walks away. ANNA has placed\n        herself in front of GRAN, as if to protect him.)",
                "Koll. I think we had better change the subject, and go out for a little!",
                "The King (aside, to him). Yes, get him away!",
                "Flink (in the background, as if he were addressing an invisible\n        audience). We must have discipline in the ranks!",
                "Koll. Gran, ask your maid to hurry up with the supper.",
                "Gran. Yes, I will.",
                "Koll (to the KING). What do you say to a turn in the garden, meanwhile?",
                "The King. By all means!",
                "Flink (coming forward to GRAN). This friendship of yours with the King -- to\n        which I had attached no particular importance -- I hope it has not\n        altogether -- (Stops short.)",
                "Gran. -- not altogether corrupted me, you mean?",
                "Flink. Exactly.",
                "The King (laughing). Politically?",
                "Flink. Politics are not unconnected with morals, sir!",
                "The King. But why get so heated, sir? We know that the present King is a --",
                "Koll (breaking in hurriedly). Don't say any more!",
                "The King (with a laugh). You said yourself that he doesn't care a brass\n        farthing about the whole matter -- he has something else to do! And\n        so the whole thing ends in smoke!",
                "Flink (more amiably). I dare say you are right.",
                "The King. Of course I am. You are all agreed that, under his rule,\n        republican sentiments are growing in real earnest.",
                "Flink. You are right! He couldn't help things on better if he were a\n        republican himself, I assure you!",
                "The King. Perhaps he is a republican?",
                "Flink (animatedly). Perhaps he is! Splendid! And works against\n        his own interests -- !",
                "The King. A sort of commercial traveller working for the downfall of his\n        own firm!",
                "Flink (excitedly). For the downfall of his own firm! Splendid! Props up\n        his reactionary rule by means of royal pronouncements, confidential\n        communications, public speeches --",
                "The King. -- in a suicidal manner!",
                "Flink. Splendidly suicidal! Ah, that makes you laugh, does it?",
                "Koll. Hush, some one might hear us!",
                "Flink. I don't care who hears us! (The KING bursts out laughing.) But\n        you ought, as one of the King's officials, to stop his laughing!\n        (Points to the KING.) It's shocking! -- It's high treason!",
                "Koll. Listen to me!",
                "Flink. You ought to arrest him for laughing like that! Suppose the King --",
                "Gran. That is the King! (The KING goes on laughing. FLINK looks\n        from him to the others, and from the others to him.)",
                "The King. This is too much for me! (Sits down. FLINK rushes out.)",

                "Koll. For all his queer ways, he is too good a fellow to be made a fool\n        of.",

                "Gran. Hush! -- he is coming back. (The KING gets up as FLINK comes in\n        again.)",
                "Flink. Your Majesty may be assured that I would never have expressed\n        myself as I did in your Majesty's presence if I had been fairly treated\n        and told whom I was addressing.",
                "The King. I know. The fault is mine alone.",
                "Flink. The fault is that of others -- my so-called friends.",
                "The King (earnestly). By no means! It is mine -- mine alone. I have\n        had a scolding for it! -- And in your presence I ask my friends'\n        pardon; I have put them in a false position. And, in the next place, I\n        ask for your forgiveness. My sense of humour got the better of me.\n        (Laughs again.)",
                "Flink. Yes, it was extremely amusing.",
                "The King. It really was! And, after all, what have you to complain of?\n        You had an opportunity of speaking your mind, any way!",
                "Flink. I certainly did!",
                "The King. Very well, then! -- And when you wanted to show any\n        respect, I prevented you. So I think we are quits.",
                "Flink. No, we are not.",
                "The King (impatiently). Indeed? -- What do you want from me, then?",
                "Flink (proudly). Nothing!",
                "The King. I beg your pardon! I did not mean to offend you.",
                "Flink. You have done so to a degree that you are naturally incapable of\n        appreciating. (Goes out.)",
                "The King. This is a nice business! (Laughs. Then notices GRAN, who is\n        standing at his desk with his back to the KING, and goes up to him.) You\n        are angry with me.",
                "Gran (looking up slowly). Yes.",
                "The King. Why didn't you stop me?",
                "Gran. It all happened too quickly. But to think that you could have the\n        heart to do it -- in my own house -- to a man who was my father's\n        oldest friend, and is mine -- !",
                "The King. Harald! (Puts his arm round his shoulders.) Have I ever asked\n        you for anything that you have not given me?",
                "Gran. No.",
                "The King. Then I ask you now to admit that you know that, if I had\n        thought this would hurt you, I would never have done it -- not for\n        worlds! Do you still believe as well of me as that?",
                "Gran. Yes.",
                "The King. Thank you. Then I will admit to you, in return, that for\n        months past I have lived in a state of horrible tension of mind; and\n        that is why I jump too easily from one extreme to the other. So, my\n        friends, you must forgive me! Or finish my scolding some other time!\n        Because now I must talk to you of the matter which induced me to come\n        here. You are the only ones I can turn to; so be good to me! -- Shall\n        we sit down again?",
                "Koll. As you please.",
                "The King (moving towards the table). I know you both want to ask me the\n        same question: why I have never come before now. My answer is: because I\n        have only now arrived at a clear conception of my own position. Some\n        months ago some hard words that were used to me lit a fire in my heart\n        and burnt out a heap of rubbish that had collected there. (ANNA fills\n        their glasses.) Won't you send that girl away?",
                "Gran. She is deaf and dumb.",
                "The King. Poor girl! (Sits down.) When I came back from my cruise round\n        the world, the old king was dead. My father had come to the throne, and\n        I was crown prince, and I went with my father to the cathedral to attend\n        a thanksgiving service for my safe return.",
                "Gran. I was there.",
                "The King. The whole thing was a novelty to me, and a solemn one. I was\n        overcome with emotion. Seeing that, my father whispered to me: \"Come\n        farther forward, my boy! The people must see their future king praying.\"\n        That finished it! I was not born to be a king; my soul was still too\n        unsullied, and I spurned such falsehood with the deepest loathing. Just\n        think of it! -- to come back from three years at sea, and begin my\n        life in that way -- as if perpetually in front of a mirror! I won't\n        dwell on it. But when my father died and I became king, I had become so\n        accustomed to the atmosphere of falsehood I lived in that I no longer\n        recognised truth when I saw it. The constitution prescribed my religion\n        for me -- and naturally I had none. And it was the same with\n        everything -- one thing after another! What else could you expect?\n        The only tutor I valued -- you, Koll -- had been dismissed; they\n        considered you to be too freethinking.",
                "Koll (smilingly). Oh, yes!",
                "The King. The only real friend that dated from my happier days -- you,\n        Harald, had been sent to the right about; you were a republican. It was\n        while I was in despair over that loss that I fell really in love for the\n        first time -- with your sister, Harald. Banishment, again. What then?\n        Why, then the craving that every healthy youth feels -- the desire\n        for love -- was turned into dissolute channels. (Drinks.)",
                "Gran. I understand, well enough.",
                "The King. Well, put all those things together. That was what my life was -- until\n        just lately. Because lately something happened, my dear friends. And now\n        you must help me! Because, to make a long story short, either I mean to\n        be the chief official in my country in a peaceful, citizenlike, genuine\n        way, or -- as God is above me -- I will no longer be king! (Gets\n        up, and the others do so.)",
                "Koll. Ah, we have got it at last!",
                "The King. Do you think I don't know that our republican friend there\n        spoke what is every thoughtful man's verdict upon me? (They are silent.)\n        But how could I possibly undertake my task, as long as I believed\n        everything to be make-believe and falsehood, without exception? Now I\n        know the root of the falsehood! It is in our institutions; he was quite\n        right. And one kind of falsehood begets another. You cannot imagine how\n        ludicrous it appeared to me -- who up till then had led such a\n        sinful, miserable existence -- when I saw honourable men pretending\n        that I was a being of some superior mould! I! (Walks up and down, then\n        stops.) It is the state -- our institutions -- that demand this\n        falsehood both on their part and on mine. And that for the security and\n        happiness of the country! (Moves about restlessly.) From the time I\n        became crown prince they kept from me everything that might have\n        instilled truth into me -- friendship, love, religion, a vocation -- for\n        my vocation is quite another one; and it was all done in the name of my\n        country! And now that I am king, they take away all responsibility from\n        me as well -- all responsibility for my own acts -- the system\n        demands it! Instead of an individual, what sort of a contemptible\n        creature do they make of me! The kingly power, too? -- that is in the\n        hands of the people's representatives and the government. I don't\n        complain of that; but what I do complain of is that they should pretend\n        that I have it, and that everything should be done in my\n        name; that I should be the recipient of petitions, cheers, acclamations,\n        obeisances -- as if the whole power and responsibility were centred\n        in my person! In me -- from whom, in the interests of all,\n        they have taken away everything! Is that not a pitiful and ludicrous\n        falsehood? And, to make it credible, they endow me into the bargain with\n        a halo of sanctity! \"The King is sacred;\" \"Our Most Gracious Sovereign,\"\n        \"Your Majesty!\" It becomes almost blasphemous!",
                "Gran. Quite true.",
                "The King. No, if that cannot be done away with, I can do away with\n        myself. But it must be possible to do away with it! It cannot be\n        necessary for a people, who are marching on the eternal path towards\n        truth, to have a lie marching at the head of them!",
                "Koll. No, it is not necessary.",

It comes of my trying to be too clever. -- He is\n        walking towards her. Perhaps there is something in it, after all? I must\n        tell Falbe about it. (Turns to go.) Confound it, he saw that I was\n        watching them! (Goes out. The KING returns to the arbour with the\n        PRINCESS on his arm. The COUNTESS and one of the royal servants are seen\n        crossing the park in the background.)",
                "The Princess. This is a most surprising meeting! When did your Majesty\n        return?",
                "The King. Last night. -- You look very charming, Princess! Such\n        blushing cheeks! -- and so early in the morning!",
                "The Princess. I suppose you think it is rouge? -- No, Sir, it is\n        nothing but pleasure at meeting you.",
                "The King. Flatterer! And I went pale at the sight of you.",
                "The Princess. Perhaps your conscience -- ?",
                "The King. I am sorry to say my conscience had nothing to do with it. But\n        this morning I have been meeting so many people that are suffering from\n        indigestion that, when I saw your Highness walking quickly along --",
                "The Princess. Make your mind easy! My reason for my morning walk is to\n        keep my fat down. Later in the day I ride -- for the same reason. I\n        live for nothing else now.",
                "The King. It is a sacred vocation!",
                "The Princess. Because it is a royal one?",
                "The King. Do you attribute your sanctity to me? Wicked Princess!",
                "The Princess. Both my sanctity and any good fortune I enjoy. It is\n        nothing but my relationship to your Majesty that induces the\n        tradespeople to give me unlimited credit.",
                "The King. You don't feel any awkwardness about it, then?",
                "The Princess. Not a bit! The good folk have to maintain many worse\n        parasites than me! -- By the way, talking of parasites, is it true\n        that you have pensioned off all your lords-in-waiting and their\n        hangers-on?",
                "The King. Yes.",
                "The Princess. Ha, ha, ha! But why did you make the special stipulation\n        that they should live in Switzerland?",
                "The King. Because there is no court in Switzerland, and --",
                "The Princess. And so they could not fall into temptation again! I have\n        had many a good laugh at the thought of it. But it has its serious side\n        too, you know; because your Majesty cannot dispense with a court.",
                "The King. Why not?",
                "The Princess. Well, suppose some day you are \"joined in the bonds of\n        holy matrimony,\" as the parsons so beautifully put it?",
                "The King. If I were, it would be for the sake of knowing what family\n        life is.",
                "The Princess. Like any other citizen?",
                "The King. Precisely.",
                "The Princess. Are you going to keep no servants?",
                "The King. As many as are necessary -- but no more.",
                "The Princess. Then I must secure a place as chambermaid in your\n        Majesty's household as soon as possible. Because if my financial\n        circumstances are inquired into there will be nothing else left for me\n        but that!",
                "The King. You have too sacred a vocation for that, Princess!",
                "The Princess. How pretty! Your Majesty is a poet, and poets are allowed\n        to be enthusiastic about ideals. But the people are poets too, in their\n        way; they like their figure-head to be well gilded, and don't mind\n        paying for it. That is their poetry.",
                "The King. Are you certain of that?",
                "The Princess. Absolutely certain! It is a point of honour with them.",
                "The King. Then I have to weigh my honour against theirs! And my honour\n        forbids me -- for the honour of my people and their poetry -- to\n        keep up my palaces, my guards, and my court any longer! Voil\u00e0 tout!",
                "The Princess. My dear King, certain positions carry with them certain\n        duties!",
                "The King. Then I know higher duties than those! -- But, Princess,\n        here are we two seriously discussing --",
                "The Princess. Yes, but there is something at the bottom of it that is\n        not to be laughed away. All tradition and all experience proclaim it to\n        be the truth that a king -- the kingly majesty -- should be a\n        dignity apart; and should be the ultimate source of law, surrounded with\n        pomp and circumstance, and secure behind the fortified walls of wealth,\n        rank, and hereditary nobility. If he steps out of that magic circle, the\n        law's authority is weakened.",
                "The King. Has your Royal Highness breakfasted yet?",
                "The Princess. No. (Bursts out laughing.)",
                "The King. Because, if you had, I should have had great pleasure is\n        giving you a lesson in history; but on an empty stomach that would be\n        cruel.",
                "The Princess. Do you know -- you used to be such an entertaining\n        king, but this last year you have become so tedious!",
                "The King. Most beautiful of princesses! Do you really mean to say that I\n        rise and fall in your estimation according as I have my pretty royal\n        gew-gaws on or not?",
                "The Princess. In my estimation?",
                "The King. Or in any one's? You know the story of \"The Emperor's New\n        Clothes\"?",
                "The Princess. Yes.",
                "The King. We don't keep up that pretence any longer.",
                "The Princess. But will every one understand?",
                "The King. You understand, don't you?",
                "The Princess. The people or I -- that is all the same, I suppose! You\n        are very flattering.",
                "The King. Heaven forbid that I should lump your Royal Highness together\n        with the common herd; but --",
                "The Princess. We have already had proof of the fact that your Majesty\n        does not hold the same place in every one's estimation that you\n        do in mine, at all events!",
                "The King. If I occupy a place of honour in your Royal Highness's heart,\n        your Royal Highness may be certain that --",
                "The Princess. I will interrupt you to save you from speaking an untruth!\n        Because the way to attain to a place of honour in your Majesty's heart\n        is not to admire you as I do, but, on the contrary, to shout out: \"I\n        despise you!\" -- Au revoir!",
                "The King. You wicked, terrifying, dangerous --",
                "The Princess. -- omniscient and ubiquitous Princess! (Makes a deep\n        curtsey, and goes away.)",
                "The King (calling after her). In spite of everything, my heart goes with\n        you --",
                "The Princess. -- to show me the door! I know all about that! (To the\n        COUNTESS.) Come, Countess! (Goes out. FALBE, an old gentleman in\n        civilian dress, has come in from the side to which the KING'S back is\n        turned.)",
                "The King. How the devil did she -- ?",
                "Falbe (coming up behind him). Your Majesty!",
                "The King (turning quickly). Ah, there you are!",
                "Falbe. Yes, sir -- we have been walking about in the park for some\n        time; your Majesty was engaged.",
                "The King. Not engaged -- I was only deadening thoughts by gossiping.\n        My anxiety was too much for me. So they have come? -- both of them?",
                "Falbe. Both of them.",
                "The King. Can I believe it! (Appears overcome.) But -- you must wait\n        a moment! I can't, just at this moment -- . I don't know what has\n        come over me!",
                "Falbe. Are you unwell, sir? You look so pale.",
                "The King My nerves are not what they should be. Is there any water near\n        here?",
                "Falbe (pointing, in astonishment). Why, there is the fountain, Sir!",
                "The King. Of course! Of course! -- I don't seem able to collect my\n        thoughts. And my mouth is as dry as -- . Look here, I am going that\n        way (points); and then you can -- you can bring the ladies here. -- She\n        is here! She is here! (Goes out to the left, and turns round as he\n        goes.) Don't forget to lock the gates of the inner park!",
                "Falbe. Of course not, Sir. (Goes out to the right, and returns bringing\n        in the BARONESS MARC and CLARA.) His Majesty will be here in a moment.\n        (Goes out to the right.)",
                "Clara. You must stay near enough for me to be able to call you.",
                "Baroness. Of course, my dear. Compose yourself; nothing can happen.",
                "Clara. I am so frightened.",
                "Baroness. Here is the King! (The KING comes in and bows to them.)",
                "The King. Excuse me, ladies, for having kept you waiting. I am very\n        grateful to you both for coming.",
                "Baroness. We only came upon your Majesty's solemn promise --",
                "The King. -- which shall be inviolable.",
                "Baroness. I understand that you wish to speak to Miss Ernst alone?",
                "The King. Your ladyship need only go up to the top of that little slope.\n        (Points.) I can recommend the view from there.",
                "Baroness. The interview will not be a long one, I suppose?",
                "The King. If it is, I give your ladyship permission to come and\n        interrupt us. (The BARONESS goes out. The KING turns to CLARA.) May I be\n        permitted to thank you again -- you especially -- for having been\n        so good as to grant me this interview?",
                "Clara. It will be the only one.",
                "The King. I know that. You have not condescended to answer one of my\n        letters --",
                "Clara. I have not read them.",

                "Clara (trembling). What has your Majesty to say to me?",
                "The King. Indeed, I can't tell it you in a single sentence. Won't you\n        sit down? (CLARA remains standing.) You must not be afraid of me. I mean\n        you no harm; I never could mean you any harm.",
                "Clara (in tears). Then what do you call the persecution that I have\n        endured for more than a year?",
                "The King. If you had condescended to read a single one of my long and\n        many letters you would have known I call it a passion that is stronger\n        than -- . (CLARA turns to go. The KING continues anxiously.) No, Miss\n        Ernst, by everything you hold dear, I beg you not to leave me!",

                "The King. If that is an insult your terms are very hard.",

                "The King. Don't cry, Miss Ernst! You don't know how you hurt me!",
                "Clara (angrily). Do you know what it means to try and ruin a young\n        girl's reputation?",
                "The King. I repeat that you are doing me an injustice",

                "Clara. When a king says such a thing as -- as you did just now, to a\n        poor little governess, it is more than an insult! It is so cowardly, so\n        base! And to think that you could have the heart to do it after what you\n        have done to my father!",
                "The King. Your father? -- I?",

                "Clara (slowly). Yes. (A pause.) I may remind your Majesty that he was\n        sentenced for high treason. And why? Because he warned the young men at\n        the university against the bad example set by the King! (A pause.) He\n        was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. In escaping from his\n        prison he broke both his legs; and now he lives in exile -- a cripple -- supported\n        by what money I am able to earn. (A pause.) You have ruined his life -- and\n        now you are trying to ruin mine too!",
                "The King. I beg of you -- !",
                "Clara. I am ashamed of my tears. It is not compassion for myself or for\n        my father that makes them flow; it is the heartless injustice of it all\n        that overcomes me.",

                "The King. But my intention is not to --",
                "Clara (interrupting him). And you are not even man enough to be ashamed\n        of yourself!",
                "The King. Yes, you may say what you please to me!",
                "Clara. I have nothing more to say to you. I have said what I have to\n        say. (Turns to go.)",
                "The King. No, don't go! You have not even heard me yet. You don't even\n        know what I want to beg of you!",
                "Clara. My dishonour.",
                "The King (vehemently). You misunderstand me utterly! If you had only\n        read a single one of my letters you would have known that there is\n        standing before you a man whom you have humbled. Ah, don't look so\n        incredulous! It is true, if there is any truth in anything. You don't\n        believe me? (Despairingly.) How am I to -- ! A man who has risked\n        your contempt for more than a year, and has been faithful to you without\n        even being allowed to see you or exchange a word with you -- who has\n        had no thought for anything or any one else -- is not likely to be\n        doing that out of mere idleness of heart! Do you not believe that,\n        either?",
                "Clara. No.",
                "The King. Well, then, there must surely be some general truths that you,\n        as Ernst's daughter, cannot refuse to believe! Let me ask you if you can\n        understand how a man becomes what I was at the time when I repeatedly\n        insulted you. You must know, from your father's books, in what an\n        unnatural atmosphere a king is brought up, the soul-destroying sense of\n        self-importance which all his surroundings foster, until, even in his\n        dreams, he thinks himself something more than human; the doubtful\n        channels into which his thoughts are forced, while any virtues that he\n        has are trumpeted abroad, and his vices glossed over with tactful and\n        humorous tolerance. Don't you think that a young king, full of eager\n        life, as I was, may plead something in excuse of himself that no other\n        man can?",
                "Clara. Yes, I admit that.",
                "The King. Then you must admit that the very position he has to assume as\n        a constitutional monarch is an acted lie. Think what a king's vocation\n        is; can a vocation of that sort be hereditary? Can the finest and\n        noblest vocation in the world be that?",
                "Clara. No!",
                "The King. Then suppose that he realises that himself; suppose that the\n        young king is conscious, however dimly and partially, of the lie he is\n        living -- and suppose that, to escape from it, he rushes into a life\n        of pleasure. Is it not conceivable that he may have some good in him,\n        for all that? And then suppose that one morning, after a night of\n        revelling, the sun shines into his room; and he seems to see upon the\n        wall, in letters of fire, some words that were said to him the night\n        before -- true words (CLARA looks up at him in surprise) -- the\n        words: \"I despise you!\" (CLARA gives a start.) Words like that can burn\n        out falsehood. And he, to whom they are said, may long to hear again the\n        tones of the voice that spoke them. No man has ever hated what has given\n        him new life. If you had read a single one of the letters which I felt\n        impelled to write even if they were refused acceptance -- you would\n        not have called it persecution. (CLARA does not answer.) And, as for my\n        persecution of your father -- I am not going to make any excuses for\n        myself; I will only ask you to remember that a king has no control over\n        the law and its judgments. I feel the sincerest respect for your father.",
                "Clara. Thank you.",
                "The King. And it is just part of the falsehood I was speaking of, that\n        he should be condemned for saying of me what I have said a thousand\n        times of myself!",
                "Clara (softly). Dare I believe that?",
                "The King. Ah, if only you had read one of my letters! Or even the little\n        book of poems I sent you last! I thought that, if you would not receive\n        my letters, perhaps a book --",
                "Clara. I do not accept anonymous gifts.",
                "The King. I see you are on your guard -- although I don't admit that\n        the poems were mine! May I read it to you?",
                "Clara. I don't understand -- .",
                "The King. One that I marked -- for you. It will prove to you what you\n        refuse to believe.",
                "Clara. But if the poem is not yours?",
                "The King. The fact that I have marked it shows that its sentiments apply\n        to me. Will you let me read it to you? (CLARA looks up.) Do not be too\n        much surprised, Miss Ernst! (Takes a slim volume from his pocket.) I\n        found this somewhere. (Turns over the leaves.) It won't take long to\n        read. May I?",
                "Clara. If only I understood --",
                "The King. -- why I want to read it? Simply for the reason that you\n        have forbidden me to speak to you -- or to write to you; but not, as\n        yet, to read to you! (CLARA smiles. A pause.) Do you know -- a little\n        event has just happened in my life? -- and yet not such a little one,\n        after all!",
                "Clara. What is that?",
                "The King. I have seen you smile for the first time.",
                "Clara. Your Majesty!",
                "The King. But, Miss Ernst, is it an insult, too, to see you smile?",
                "Clara (smiling). If I consent to hear the poem, shall not the Baroness --",
                "The King. -- hear it also? With pleasure; but not at the same time!\n        Please! Because I am a very bad reader. You can show it to the Baroness\n        afterwards, if you like. (CLARA smiles.) May I?",
                "Clara. You are sure there is nothing in it that --",
                "The King. You can interrupt me, if you think fit. It is called \"The\n        Young Prince;\" and it is about -- no, I won't tell you what it is\n        about unless you will be so good as to sit down, so that I can sit down\n        too. If I stand up I shall be sure to begin declaiming, and I do that\n        shockingly badly! -- You can get up again when you like, you know!\n        (CLARA smiles and sits down. The KING sits down beside her.) Now, then!\n        \"The Young Prince.\" (To himself.) I can scarcely breathe. (He begins to\n        read.)",
                "Full fed with early flattery and pride --",
                "(Breaks off.) Excuse me, Miss Ernst! I don't feel --",
                "Clara. Is your Majesty not well?",
                "The King. Quite well! It is only -- . Now, then!",
                "Full fed with early flattery and pride,\n His sated soul was wearied all too young;\n Honour and kingly pomp seemed naught to him\n But whimsies from the people's folly sprung.\n\n From such pretence he fled to what was real -- \n Fair women's arms, laughter and love and pleasure,\n All the mad joy of life; whate'er he craved,\n He found was given him in double measure.\n\n Whate'er he craved -- until one day a maiden\n To whom he whispered, like a drunken sot,\n \"I'd give my life to make thee mine, my sweeting!\"\n Turned from him silently and answered not.\n\n He sought by every means to win her to him;\n But when his love with cold contempt was met,\n It was as if a judgment had been spoken\n Upon his life, and doom thereon were set.\n\n His boon companions left him; in his castles\n None seemed to be awake but he alone,\n Racked with remorse, enshrouded in the darkness\n Of dull despair, yet longing to atone.\n\n Then through the darkness she appeared! and humbly,\n Emboldend by her gentleness of mien,\n He sued once more: \"If only thou wouldst listen!\n If still 'twere not too late -- \"",
                "(His emotion overcomes him, and he stops suddenly, gets up, and walks\n        away from CLARA. She gets up, as he comes back to her.) Excuse me! I had\n        no intention of making a scene. But it made me think of -- . (Breaks\n        of again overcome by emotion, and moves a little way from her. There is\n        a pause as he collects himself before returning to her.) As you can\n        hear, Miss Ernst, it is nothing much of a poem -- not written by a\n        real poet, that is to say; a real poet would have exalted his theme, but\n        this is a commonplace --",
                "Clara. Has your Majesty anything more to say to me? (A pause.)",
                "The King. If I have anything more to say to any one, it is to you.",
                "Clara. I beg your pardon.",
                "The King. No, it is I should beg yours. But I am sure you do not wish me\n        to lie to you.",
                "Clara (turning her head away). No.",
                "The King. You have no confidence in me. (Control, his emotion.) Will you\n        ever, I wonder, come to under stand that the only thing I crave for now\n        is -- one person's confidence!",
                "Clara. Any one who speaks as your Majesty has done to-day surely craves\n        for more than that.",
                "The King. More than that, yes; but, first of all, one person's\n        confidence.",
                "Clara (turning away). I don't understand --",
                "The King (interrupting her, with emotion). Your life has not been as\n        empty and artificial as mine.",
                "Clara. But surely you have your task here to fill it with?",
                "The King. I remember reading once about the way a rock was undermined,\n        and the mine filled with gunpowder with an electric wire leading to it.\n        Just a slight pressure on a little button and the great rock was\n        shattered into a thousand pieces. And in the same way everything is\n        ready here; but the little pressure -- to cause the explosion -- is\n        what I am waiting for!",
                "Clara. The metaphor is a little forced.",
                "The King. And yet it came into my mind as unconsciously as you broke off\n        that twig just now. If I do not get what I lack, nothing can be\n        accomplished -- there can be no explosion! I shall abandon the whole\n        thing and let myself go under.",
                "Clara. Go under?",
                "The King. Well, not like the hero of a sensational novel -- not\n        straight to the bottom like a stone -- but like a dreamer carried off\n        by pixies in a wood, with one name ever upon my lips! And the world\n        would have to look after itself.",
                "Clara. But that is sheer recklessness.",
                "The King. I know it is; but I am reckless. I stake everything upon one\n        throw! (A pause.)",
                "Clara. Heaven send you may win.",
                "The King. At least I am daring enough to hope that I may -- and there\n        are moments when I almost feel certain of victory!",
                "Clara (embarrassed). It is a lovely morning --",
                "The King. -- for the time of year; yes. And it is lovelier here than\n        it is anywhere else!",
                "Clara. I cannot really understand a course of action which implies a\n        want of all sense of responsibility --",
                "The King. Every one has their own point of view. A scheme of life, to\n        satisfy me, must have its greatest happiness hidden away at its core; in\n        my case that would be to have a house of my own -- all to myself,\n        like any other citizen -- from which I should go away to my work, and\n        come back to as to a safe refuge. That is the button on the electric\n        wire, do you understand? It is the little pressure on it that I am\n        waiting for. (A pause.)",
                "Clara. Have you read my father's book, Democratic Monarchy?",
                "The King. Yes.",
                "Clara. He wrote it when I was a child; and so I may say that I grew up\n        amongst ideas like -- like those I have heard from you to-day. All\n        the friends that came to our house used to talk to me about it.",
                "The King. Then no doubt you heard the crown prince talked about, too!",
                "Clara. I think I heard his name oftener mentioned at home than any\n        one's. I believe the book was written expressly for you.",
                "The King. I can feel that when I read it. If only I had been allowed to\n        read it in those days! Do you remember how in it your father maintains,\n        too, that all reform depends on the beating down of the hedge that\n        surrounds royalty? -- on a king's becoming, as he says, \"wedded to\n        his people\" in the fullest sense of the word, not irregularly or\n        surreptitiously? No king can share his people's thoughts if he lives\n        apart from them in a great palace, married to a foreign princess. There\n        is no national spirit behind a complicated court life of outlandish\n        ceremonial.",
                "Clara (turning away her head). You should have heard how vehemently my\n        father used to assert those ideas.",
                "The King. And yet he abandoned them.",
                "Clara. Became a republican, you mean?",
                "The King. Yes.",
                "Clara. He was so disappointed. (A pause.)",
                "The King. I sometimes wonder every one isn't a republican! It must come\n        to that in the end; I can see that. If only royalties nowadays thought\n        seriously enough about it to realise it!",
                "Clara. It is made so difficult for them by those who surround them.",
                "The King. Yes, you see, that is another reason why any such reform must\n        begin at home. Do you think that a king, who went every day to his work\n        from a home that was in every respect like that of one of his people,\n        could fail in the long run?",
                "Clara. There are so many different kinds of homes.",
                "The King. I mean a home that holds love instead of subservience -- comfort\n        instead of ceremony-truth instead of flattery; a home where -- ah,\n        well, I need not teach a woman what a home means.",
                "Clara. We make them what they are.",
                "The King. Surely; but they are especially what women make them. (A\n        pause.)",
                "Clara. The sun is quite strong now.",
                "The King. But it can scarcely pierce through the screen of leaves here.",
                "Clara. When the sun shines down like this and the leaves tremble --",
                "The King. The sunshine seems to tremble too.",
                "Clara. Yes, but it makes one feel as if everything were trembling -- even\n        deep down into our hearts!",
                "The King. That is true. -- Yes, its homes are the most precious\n        things a nation makes. Their national characteristics mean reverence for\n        their past and possibilities for their future.",
                "Clara. I understand better now what you meant.",
                "The King. When I said I wanted to begin at the beginning?",
                "Clara. Yes. (A pause.)",
                "The King. I cannot do otherwise. My heart must be in my work.",
                "Clara (smiling). My father had his heart in his work, too.",
                "The King. Forgive me -- but don't you think it was just the want of\n        an object in his life that led your father to push his theories too far? -- an\n        object outside himself, I mean?",
                "Clara. Perhaps. If my mother had lived -- . (Stops.)",
                "The King. -- he might have taken it differently; don't you think so?",
                "Clara. I have sometimes thought so. (A pause.)",

                "Clara. Yes, there is the fountain.",
                "The King. That is true; but one ends by hardly hearing a continuous\n        sound like that.",
                "Clara. There is a tremulousness in that too. (Looks round her.)",
                "The King. What are you looking for?",

On the right is the club, a large building, standing alone;\n        lights are shining from all its windows. Steps lead from the door, above\n        which is a balcony. The square is full of people. In the background,\n        standing on the lowest step of the pedestal of an equestrian statue, is\n        a BALLAD SINGER, singing to the accompaniment of his guitar. Cigars,\n        oranges, and other wares are being sold by hawkers. The singer's voice\n        is heard before the curtain rises. The crowd gradually joins him in the\n        refrain which he repeats after each verse of his ballad.)",

A voice in the crowd:\n        \"That is just what we thought!\") I am charged to announce publicly that\n        he despises her for it and sends her his curse!

Let me alone!\" -- and other voices: \"Don't let him go out!\" -- \"He\n        is drunk!\" Eventually COUNT PLATEN comes out on to the steps, hatless\n        and dishevelled.)",

A free fight\n        ensues.) Hiss them when they come! (Cries of \"Throw him down!\" -- \"Bravo!\" -- \"Hurrah!\")\n        I, Count Platen, tell you to do so! Hiss him, howl at him, make a\n        regular hullabaloo when he comes! I, Count Platen, tell you to!

COUNT PLATEN is hustled\n        up and down the steps, and tries to go on making his speech every time\n        he comes up.) He is defiling the throne! -- He wants to marry a\n        traitor's daughter! Shame! I, Count Platen, say so! Here I stand -- !\n        (A trumpet-call is heard; then cries of \"Here is the King!\" -- \"No,\n        it's the cavalry!\" -- \"The cavalry are coming!\" -- \"Clear the\n        square!\" A shot is heard, followed by a scream; the people take to their\n        heels as another trumpet-call is heard.

                "Baroness. What!",
                "Gran. The King desires me to tell you that he has ordered a special\n        train to be ready at 10 o'clock, so that as soon as the court is over\n        she can go to her father. The King will accompany her.",
                "Baroness. That is kind of him!",
                "Gran. Then you will get ready everything that she needs for a night's\n        journey?",
                "Baroness. Yes.",
                "Gran. And without her being aware of it? The King does not wish her to\n        know anything of her father's condition till after the court.",
                "Baroness. The court is to be held, then?",
                "Gran. The court is to be held. After it is over, His Majesty will tell\n        her the news himself.",
                "Baroness. I am thankful for that. -- But what did Professor Ernst\n        say? Why has he not answered his daughter's letter? Why has he hidden\n        from her? Is he really irreconcilable?",
                "Gran. Irreconcilable? He hates her!",
                "Baroness. Good heavens!",
                "Gran. And not only her, but every one that has made common cause with\n        the King -- every one!",
                "Baroness. I suppose it was to be expected. -- But won't you sit down?",
                "Gran (bows, but remains standing). I had a talk with his doctor before I\n        saw him. He had some hesitation about letting me in. It was a fortnight\n        since his patient had been able to move. But when I told him my errand,\n        and that I had come from the King, he let me see him.",
                "Baroness. How did he look? He was a fine man once.",
                "Gran. He was sitting in a big chair, a mere paralysed wreck of a man.\n        But when he saw me and realised who I was -- and probably, too, what\n        my errand was -- he found the strength not only to move, but to seize\n        both his crutches and raise himself on them! I shall never forget his\n        gaunt ashen-grey face, the feverish gleam in his sunken eyes, his\n        unkempt hair and beard --",
                "Baroness. He must have looked terrible!",
                "Gran. He was like a creature from beyond the grave -- with an\n        eternity of hatred in his eyes!",
                "Baroness. Oh, my God!",
                "Gran. When at last I could find my voice, I gave him his daughter's\n        greeting, and asked if she might come and see him. A dark look came into\n        his eyes, and his face flushed for a moment, as he gasped out: \"May she\n        be -- .\" He could not finish the sentence. His crutches slipped from\n        his grasp and he fell down, blood pouring from his mouth. The doctor\n        rushed to him; and for a long time we thought he was dead.",
                "Baroness. But he came round?",
                "Gran. I waited an hour or two before I started back. Then the doctor\n        told me that he had recovered consciousness, but that the end could\n        certainly not be far off -- perhaps not twenty-four hours.",
                "Baroness. It must have been a shock to you.",
                "Gran. It was.",
                "Baroness. But what did he mean by: \"May she be -- \"",
                "Gran. That is what I have been wondering.",
                "Baroness. He cannot do her any harm, can he?",
                "Grad. He may give her the same reception that he gave me; if she goes.",
                "Baroness, Even if the King is with her?",
                "Gran. All the more then!",
                "Baroness. Oh, that would be horrible! But it won't prevent her going.",
                "Gran. Let us hope so!",
                "Baroness. I am certain of it! She has extraordinary strength of\n        character -- just like her father's.",
                "Gran. Yes, that is the one thing I rely on.",
                "Baroness. What do you mean? Your words sound so despondent!",
                "Gran. I mean what is perfectly true -- that everything will depend\n        upon her strength of character.",
                "Baroness. What about the King, then?",
                "Gran. I could say a great deal on that topic, Baroness; but (bows) you\n        must excuse me -- I haven't time now.",
                "Baroness. How are the elections going?",
                "Gran. They are going well -- if nothing happens now?",
                "Baroness. What could happen?",
                "Gran. The situation is very strained; one must expect anything.",
                "Baroness. Are you anxious, your Excellency?",
                "Gran. I must beg leave to retire now. (A MAID comes in.)",
                "Maid (to GRAN). The Inspector of Police, who came with your Excellency,\n        wishes to know if he may speak to your Excellency.",
                "Gran. I will come at once. (To the BARONESS.) There is rioting going on\n        in the town, not far from here -- in front of the club.",
                "Baroness (in alarm). What? -- Isn't the King coming along that way?",
                "Gran. Don't be afraid! We have taken our precautions -- Good-bye!\n        (Goes out.)",
                "Baroness. -- He has quite alarmed me -- everything seems to come\n        at the same time! She has had a suspicion that there was something amiss\n        with her father; I have noticed that, but she hasn't wanted to speak\n        about it. (CLARA comes in, dressed for the court.) Ah, there you are, my\n        dear! Quite ready?",
                "Clara. Quite.",
                "Baroness (looking at her). Well, I daresay there have been royal brides\n        more elaborately dressed, but I am sure there has never been one more\n        charming. (Kisses her.)",
                "Clara. I think I hear a carriage?",
                "Baroness. I expect it is the King!",

                "Baroness. Do you feel afraid?",
                "Clara. No, no -- it is not that at all; it is something -- something\n        that you don't -- a kind of feeling as if -- as if some one were\n        haunting me; and I know who it is. I only feel secure when the King is\n        with me. I hope it may be he coming. (Goes to the window.)",

                "Clara. I think so.",
                "Princess. I don't think you have. Have you read what the papers say\n        about it -- every one of them -- to-day?",
                "Clara. No. The King has advised me not to.",
                "Princess. But the letters that have been sent to you? I know letters\n        have been written to you.",
                "Clara. The King has advised me not to read them either. He takes all the\n        letters.",
                "Princess. Do you know that they are rioting in the streets close to\n        here?",
                "Clara (in alarm). No!",

                "Clara. No.",
                "Princess. What shall you do?",
                "Clara (after a moment, quietly). I shall go with the King.",
                "Princess. A nice road you are dragging him along, truly! And I assure\n        you that the farther you go along it, the worse it will become. You\n        cannot possibly have prepared yourself for all that you will have to go\n        through.",
                "Clara. I think I have.",

                "Clara (bending her head). I have prayed to God.",
                "Princess. Pshaw! I mean that you cannot have considered the misery into\n        which you are dragging the King -- and the disgrace and trouble you\n        are bringing upon all his people. (CLARA is silent.) You are young\n        still; your heart cannot be altogether hardened yet, whatever your past\n        may have been.",
                "Clara (proudly). I have no reason to be ashamed of my past.",
                "Princess. Indeed? What sort of a past has it been, then?",

                "Clara (drooping her head). Ah, yes.",

                "Clara. I know that. He has told me so.",
                "Princess. Really! -- After all, is it a sacrifice you are making for\n        his sake? Do you love the King?",
                "Clara (faintly). Yes.",
                "Princess. Then listen to me. If you loved the King, you would have made\n        a real sacrifice for him. We are women, you and I; we can\n        understand these things without many words. But such a sacrifice does\n        not consist in consenting to be his queen.",
                "Clara. It is not I that wished it.",
                "Princess. You have allowed yourself to be persuaded? -- Well, you are\n        either deceiving yourself, my girl, or you are deceiving him. Perhaps\n        you began with the one and are ending with the other. Anyway, it is time\n        you had your eyes opened as to which of you it is that is making the\n        sacrifice. Do you not know that, on your account, he is already the\n        target for general contempt? (CLARA bursts into tears.) If that makes\n        you repent, show it -- show it by your deeds!",
                "Clara. I repent of nothing.",
                "Princess (in astonishment). What state of mind are you in, then?",
                "Clara. I have suffered terribly. But I pray God for strength to bear it.",
                "Princess. Don't talk nonsense! The whole thing is a horrible confusion\n        of ideas -- half remorse and half cant -- the one so mixed up with\n        the other in your mind that you cannot disentangle them. But, believe\n        me, others feel very sure that sacred things and -- and what I won't\n        call bluntly by its name, go very ill together! So don't waste those\n        airs on me; they only irritate me!",
                "Clara. Princess, don't be cruel to me. I am suffering, all the\n        same.",
                "Princess. Why on earth do you want to go any farther with the affair? If\n        you aren't clear about it, take advice! Your father is opposed to it,\n        isn't he?",
                "Clara. Yes. (Throws herself into a chair.)",
                "Princess. He has hidden himself away from you. You don't know where he\n        is, or how he is -- though you know he is crippled and ill. And,\n        meanwhile, here you are in full dress, with a rose in your hair, waiting\n        to set out to a court at the palace! Are you willing to pass through\n        contemptuous rioting crowds, and over your sick father's body, to become\n        queen? What callous levity! What a presumptuous mixture of what you\n        think is love, duty, sacrifice, trial -- with an unscrupulous\n        ambition -- ! The King? Are you depending on him? He is a poet. He\n        loves anything unusual or sensational. Resistance stimulates him; and\n        that is what drives him into believing that his love will be unending.\n        When you have been married a week, it will be all over. If he had not\n        met with resistance, it would have been all over before this. I know the\n        King better than you; for I know his faithlessness. It is like his love -- unending!\n        It hurts you to hear that, does it? Well, it hurts one's eyes to look at\n        the sun. But I can tell you about these things. The only reason I had\n        for coming was to tell you what I know. And now that I have seen you, I\n        can tell you that I know one thing more -- and I will tell you what\n        it is. If you actually allow the King, with his ardent temperament, to\n        stray into a path which will lead to the ruin of his career, your action\n        will, in the fullness of time, recoil so appallingly upon your own head\n        that it will kill you. I know you are one of those that faithlessness,\n        remorse and contempt would kill. -- Don't look so beseechingly\n        at me; I cannot retract a word of what I have said. But I can tell you\n        now what I had decided upon before I came. I will look after your\n        future. I am not rich; but, as sure as I stand here before you, you\n        shall live free from care -- you shall have everything that you need -- for\n        the rest of your life. I want no thanks! I do it for the sake of the\n        King, and for the sake of the country to which I belong. It is my duty.\n        Only get up now and come with me to my carriage. (Offers CLARA her\n        hand.)",
                "Clara. If it were as easy as that, I should have done it long, long ago.",
                "Princess (turns away. Then comes back). Get up. (Pulls her on to her\n        feet.) Do you love the King?",
                "Clara. Do I love him? I am a motherless child, and have lived alone with\n        a father who has been constantly persecuted on account of his\n        principles; I shared his ideals from a very early age, and I have never\n        abandoned them since. Then one day I was given the chance of making\n        these ideals real. \"What I long to do, you shall\n        accomplish!\" he said. There is something great about that, Princess -- something\n        all-powerful -- a call from God Himself. Of that I am certain.",
                "Princess. It is merely a rhapsody of the King's -- nothing else!",
                "Clara. Then I will make it real and live it! I have given my whole soul\n        to it, and have strengthened his to the same end. It has been my ideal\n        all my life.",
                "Princess. And you believe that it will last?",
                "Clara. Yes.",
                "Princess. Then let me beg you to believe this, too -- it will last\n        until he has attained his end.",
                "Clara. If you mean our marriage, let me tell you that that is not\n        our end.",
                "Princess (in surprise). What is, then?",
                "Clara. Our end is to accomplish something together. That task shall be\n        consecrated and ennobled by our love. Yes, you may look at me! Those\n        were his own words.",
                "Princess. That answer! -- That thought! -- But what certainty have\n        you?",
                "Clara. Of what?",
                "Princess. That you did not put the thought into his mind? -- and that\n        the fire in his soul may not flicker out?",
                "Clara. If I needed any assurance, I should find it in the fact that he\n        changed his whole life for my sake; he waited for me for more than a\n        year. Has he ever done that for any one before? I am sure he has never\n        needed to! (The PRINCESS winces.) It is those who have seduced that\n        \"ardent\" temperament of his -- you called it that yourself -- that\n        are to blame, and not I, Princess! (A pause.) I checked him to the best\n        of my power when he came to me as he was wont to go to others. (A\n        pause.) Indeed it is no sacrifice to become his wife. When one loves,\n        there is no question of sacrifice. But the position in which I now stand\n        exposes me to more suspicion than the humblest of his subjects, to more\n        scorn than if I were his mistress. Think how you have spoken to me\n        to-day yourself, Princess! (A pause.) It is no sacrifice to endure such\n        things for the man one loves. It was not I that used the word\n        \"sacrifice,\" either; and as for the sacrifice you implied that I ought\n        to have made, I don't wish to understand what you meant by that, even\n        though I am a woman as well as you! But if you knew, Princess, how hard\n        a fight I have been through before I found the strength to cast in my\n        lot with his, against my father's wish and against you all -- you\n        would not have spoken to me about making a sacrifice. At all events you\n        would not have spoken to me as you have done to-day; because you are not\n        cruel, and I know that at bottom you mean me well. (A longer pause.)",
                "Princess. This is more serious than I knew. -- Poor child, your\n        disappointment will be all the more serious.",
                "Clara. Not with him!",
                "Princess (half to herself). Is it possible he can be so changed? Was\n        that what was needed to secure a hold on him -- ? (To CLARA.) Is he\n        coming here to fetch you?",
                "Clara. Yes.",
                "Princess. What does he want to hold this court for? What is the good of\n        throwing down this challenge to all the dignitaries of his kingdom? -- especially\n        if, after all, he means to live the life of an ordinary citizen?",
                "Clara. He wished it.",
                "Princess. An exciting episode in his rhapsody! Why did you not dissuade\n        him?",
                "Clara. Because I agree with him.",
                "Princess. Perhaps you don't fully realise what it means? -- what\n        humiliation the King will have to undergo?",
                "Clara. I only know that it seems to me that these things should be done\n        openly, and that he has plenty of courage.",
                "Princess. That is mere bravado. Are you going in that dress? -- to\n        court in that dress? (CLARA is silent.) I say it is mere bravado.",
                "Clara. I have no better dress.",
                "Princess. What do you mean? Surely the King can -- ? Are you jesting?",
                "Clara (shyly). I do not allow the King to give me anything; not until -- .",
                "Princess. Doesn't he pay your expenses here, then? (Looks round the\n        room.)",
                "Clara. No.",
                "Princess. It is the Baroness?",
                "Clara. She and I. We are both poor.",
                "Princess. Ah, yes -- she has lost her post now, hasn't she?",
                "Clara. On my account -- yes. And you, Princess, who have known her -- for\n        she was once your governess -- can you really suppose that she would\n        have been faithful to me if she did not trust me and feel that this was\n        right? You treated her so contemptuously when you came in.",
                "Princess. I seem to have broken in upon the most incomprehensible\n        romance! -- Then you love the King? (CLARA nods her head.) He knows\n        how to love, and make a woman happy! He is a dazzling creature! -- We\n        shall see now whether you are to suffer for all the hearts he has\n        broken. You are not the first woman he has loved.",
                "Clara. Princess!",
                "Princess. Yes, let that sink into your mind! Your happiness is\n        embroidered with tears!",
                "Clara. It is cruel of you to reproach me with it.",
                "Princess. Forgive me! I really did not mean that. -- But there is\n        still time to put on a more suitable dress. If you dare accept no gifts\n        from the King -- you might from some one else? A King's bride is a\n        King's bride after all, you know!",
                "Clara. He told me I should not need anything more than this.",
                "Princess. Not in his eyes, I dare say. But we women know a little\n        better! -- If it were only a necklace? Will you accept this one?\n        (Begins to unfasten hers.)",
                "Clara. I knew you were kind. -- But I daren't.",
                "Princess. Why not?",
                "Clara. Because -- because people would think that -- . (Bursts\n        into tears. A pause.)",
                "Princess. Listen, my child. The whole thing is sheer lunacy; but -- as\n        it cannot be altered -- as soon as the court assembles I shall take\n        my place at your side and not leave you till it is all over. Tell the\n        King that! Good-bye!",
                "Clara (going towards her). Princess!",
                "Princess (kisses her, and whispers). Haven't you allowed him to kiss\n        you, either?",
                "Clara (in a whisper). Yes, I have.",
                "Princess (kissing her once snore). Love him! (The sound of carriage\n        wheels is heard. The BARONESS comes in.)",
                "Baroness. I hear the King's carriage.",
                "Princess. I don't wish to meet him. (Stretches out her hand to the\n        BARONESS.) Baroness! (Points to the door through which the BARONESS has\n        come in.) Can I get out that way?",
                "Baroness. Yes. (She takes the PRINCESS out. A moment later the MAID\n        ushers in the KING, who is dressed in plain clothes and wearing no\n        decorations.)",
                "The King. Clara!",
                "Clara. My friend! (They embrace.)",
                "The King. What does it mean?",
                "Clara. What?",
                "The King. The Princess' carriage here?",
                "Clara. She told me to greet you. She has just gone, and --",
                "The King. And -- ?",
                "Clara. She said as soon as the court assembled she would take her place\n        beside me and stay there till we left the palace.",
                "The King. Is it possible?",
                "Clara. It is true.",
                "The King. You have conquered her! I know she could be conquered -- she\n        has a heart, as well as a head! It is a good omen! -- So she offered\n        to do that! What will our precious nobility have to say to that?",
                "Clara. They are about the streets, aren't they?",
                "The King. Ah, then you know?",
                "Clara. I know, too, that there has been rioting outside the club.",
                "The King. You know that too? -- and are not afraid?",
                "Clara. Perhaps I might have been -- but there is something else that\n        I am more afraid of. (Draws closer to the KING.)",
                "The King. What is that?",
                "Clara. You know. (A pause.)",
                "The King. Have you been uneasy about him to-day too?",
                "Clara. All day -- incessantly. Something must have happened.",
                "The King. Well, now I can tell you where he is.",
                "Clara (eagerly). At last! Have you found him?",
                "The King. Gran has been to see him.",
                "Clara. Thank God! Is it far from here?",
                "The King. This evening, immediately after the court, you and I will both\n        start for there in a special train. We shall be there early to-morrow.",
                "Clara (throwing her arms round his neck). Thanks, thanks! How good you\n        are! Thanks! How is he? Is he ill!",
                "The King. Yes.",
                "Clara. I knew it? And implacable?",
                "The King. Yes.",
                "Clara. I feel it! (Nestles closer in his arms.)",
                "The King. Are you afraid?",
                "Clara. Yes!",
                "The King. Dear, when you see him perhaps your fear will go.",
                "Clara. Yes, only let me see him! Whatever he says, let me see him!",
                "The King. Within twelve hours from now you shall! And I shall be with\n        you.",
                "Clara. The finest thing about you is your kindness. Oh, I am so glad you\n        have come! I could not endure my fears any longer.",
                "The King. There are dissensions going on about you!",
                "Clara. Oh! -- (Nestles in his arms again.)",
                "The King. Bear up! -- It will soon be over.",
                "Clara. I believe it will. Yes, I know it will. -- Let me walk about a\n        little! (The KING walks up and down with her.)",
                "The King. And turn our thoughts to something else! Do you know where I\n        have come from?",
                "Clara. Where?",
                "The King. From our little house in the park.",
                "Clara. Why, we drove past it yesterday!",
                "The King. You will feel only one person's presence there!\n        Wherever you go, you will be surrounded by the thoughts I have had of\n        you there. If you look out of the window, or go out on to the balcony -- on\n        every rock, by each turn of the stream -- on the lawns, under the\n        trees, among the bushes -- everywhere you will find a thousand\n        thoughts of you hidden. Breathe the words \"my darling girl,\" and they\n        will all come clustering round you! -- Let us sit down.",
                "Clara. It is all like a fairy tale.",
                "The King. And I am the latest fairy prince! (He sits down and draws her\n        on to his knee.) And you are the little maid who comes, led by good\n        fairies, to the enchanted castle to wake him. He has been kept asleep by\n        wicked spells for many, many years.",
                "Clara. For many, many years!",
                "The King. I am not really I, nor you you. The monarch was\n        bewitched long ago. He was turned into a wild beast who gave reign to\n        his passion by night and slept by day. And now the maiden of humble\n        degree has become a woman and freed him from the spells.",
                "Clara. Really! Ah, you are so clever at inventing things to cheat my\n        fears away from me. And you always succeed. But after all, you know, I\n        have no strength and no courage; I am so weak.",
                "The King. You have more strength than I! -- more than any one I have\n        ever known.",
                "Clara. No, don't say that; but -- you may be sure of this! -- if I\n        did not feel that I had some strength I would never try to throw\n        in my lot with yours.",
                "The King. I will explain to you what you are! Some people are\n        tremendously more spiritual, more delicately constituted than others;\n        and they are a hundred times more sensitive. And they fancy that is\n        weakness. But it is just they who draw their strength from deeper\n        sources, through a thousand imperceptible channels. You will often find\n        them with heads erect and valiant when others have gone under; they\n        merely bend before the storm, with supple strength, when others break\n        under it. You are like that!",
                "Clara. You are very ingenious when you start explaining me!",
                "The King. Well, listen to this! At the time when I was behaving so badly\n        to you, your terror, every time I approached you, was so piteous that it\n        was always before my eyes and rang in my ears like a cry of agony from a\n        wounded heart. It is true! It filled me with terror, too. Do you call\n        that weakness, to feel things so intensely that another person is\n        influenced by your feelings against his will?",
                "Clara. No.",
                "The King. And then, when I found you again -- the way you listened to\n        me --",
                "Clara (stopping him with a kiss). Don't let us talk about it now!",
                "The King. What shall we talk about, then? It is a little too early to\n        start yet. -- Ah, I have it! We will talk about the impression you\n        will make this evening when you come forward through the brightly lit\n        rooms, radiant against the background of ugly calumny! That was prettily\n        put, wasn't it? \"Is that she?\" they will think. And then\n        something will come into their eyes that will cheat them into thinking\n        that pearls and gold are strewn over your hair, over your dress, over\n        your --",
                "Clara (putting her hand over his mouth). No, no, no! Now I am going to\n        tell you a little story!",
                "The King. Tell away!",
                "Clara. When I was a child, I saw a balloon being filled one day, and\n        there was a horrible smell from the gas. Afterwards, when I saw the\n        gleaming balloon rising in the air, I thought to myself: \"Ah, that\n        horrid smell was something burning; they had to burn it for the balloon\n        to be able to rise.\" And after that, every time I heard anything horrid\n        said about my father, I felt as if something was burning inside me, and\n        I thought of the balloon and imagined I could smell the smell. And then\n        all at once I imagined I saw it rising; the horrid part was burnt, and\n        it was able to mount aloft! I assure you that balloon was a good genius\n        to me. And now, years afterwards, when I have been a target for calumny\n        myself -- and you for my sake -- I have felt just the same thing.\n        Every word has burned; but I have got over it in a moment, and risen\n        high, high above it all! I never seem to breathe so pure an atmosphere\n        as a little while after something cruel has been said of me.",
                "The King. I shall certainly set to work and abuse you at once, if it has\n        such delightful results! I will begin with a selection from to-day's\n        papers: \"You Aspasia! You Messalina! You Pompadour! You Phylloxera, that\n        are eating into our whole moral vine-crop! You blue-eyed curse of the\n        country, that are causing panics in the money-market, overthrowing\n        ministries, and upsetting all calculations in the elections! You\n        mischievous hobgoblin, who are pouring gall into the printers' ink and\n        poison into the people's coffee, filling all the old ladies' heads with\n        buzzing flies, and the King's Majesty with a million lover's follies!\"\n        Do you know that, besides all the harm you are doing to-day, you are\n        hastening a revolution by ten years? You are! And no one can be sure\n        whether you haven't been pursuing the same wicked courses for the last\n        hundred years or more! All our royal and noble ancestors are turning in\n        their graves because of you! And if our deceased queens have any noses\n        left --",
                "Clara (interrupting him). The Baroness! (They get up. The BARONESS comes\n        in wearing a cloak over her court dress and carrying CLARA'S cloak over\n        her arm.)",
                "Baroness. I must take the liberty of disturbing you. Time is up!",
                "The King. We have been killing it by talking nonsense.",
                "Baroness. And that has put you in a good humour?",
                "The King (taking his hat). In the best of humours! Here, my darling\n        (fastens CLARA'S cloak about her shoulders), here is the last scandalous\n        bit of concealment for you! When we take it off again, you shall stand\n        radiant in the light of your own truth. Come! (Gives her his arm, and\n        they go trippingly up to the back of the room. Suddenly the phantom of\n        an emaciated figure leaning on crutches appears in their path, staring\n        at them. His hair and beard are in wild disorder, and blood is pouring\n        from his mouth. CLARA gives a terrified scream.)",
                "The King. In Heaven's name, what is it?",
                "Clara. My father!",
                "The King. Where? (To the BARONESS.) Go and see! (The BARONESS opens the\n        doors at the back and looks out).",
                "Baroness. I can see no one.",
                "The King. Look down the corridor!",
                "Baroness. No -- no one there, either! (CLARA has sunk lifelessly into\n        the KING'S arms. After one or two spasmodic twitchings of her hands, her\n        arms slip away from him and her head falls back.)",
                "The King. Help, help!",
                "The Baroness (rushing to him with a shriek). Clara!",

                "Flink. As you see. (Walks up and down for a little without speaking.)",

                "Gran (after a pause). At all events I interpret it differently from --",
                "Flink. -- from the parson? Naturally. But can any one doubt the fact\n        that it was the finger of fate?",
                "Gran. Then fate assumed her father's shape?",
                "Flink. Whether her father appeared to her at the moment of his death or\n        not (shrugs his shoulders) is a matter in which I am not interested. I\n        don't believe in such things. But that she was suffering pangs of\n        conscience, I do believe. I believe it may have brought painful visions\n        before her eyes.",
                "Gran. I knew her pretty well, and I will answer for it she had no guilty\n        conscience. She was approaching her task with enthusiasm. Any one that\n        knew her will tell you the same. With her the King was first and\n        foremost.",
                "Flink. What did she die of, then? Of enthusiasm?",
                "Gran. Of being overwrought by the force of her emotions. Her task was\n        too great for her. The time was not ripe for it. (Sadly.) Our experiment\n        was bound to fail.",
                "Flink. You condemn it when you say that! -- But with her last breath\n        she called out: \"My father!\" And, just at that moment, he died, fifty\n        miles away from her. Either she saw him, or she imagined\n        she saw him, standing before her. But his bloodstained, maltreated,\n        crippled form standing in the way of her criminal advance towards the\n        throne -- is that not a symbol of maltreated humanity revolting\n        against monarchy at the very moment when monarchy wishes to atone! Its\n        guilt through thousands of years is too black. Fate is inflexible.",
                "Gran. But with what result? Are we rid of monarchy yet?",
                "Flink. We are rid of that treacherous attempt to reconcile it with\n        modern conditions. Thank God it emerges, hand in glove with the parsons\n        and reactionaries, none the worse for its temporary eclipse.",
                "Gran. So everything is all right, I suppose?",
                "Flink. For the moment -- yes. But there used to exist here a strong\n        republican party, which enjoyed universal respect, and was making\n        extraordinary progress. Where is it now?",
                "Gran. I knew that was why you came.",
                "Flink. I have come to call you to account.",

                "Flink. The republican party has often been defeated -- but never\n        despised till now. Who is to blame for that?",
                "Gran. None of us ever think we deserve contempt.",
                "Flink. A traitor always deserves it.",
                "Gran. It is but a step from the present state of things to a republic;\n        and we shall have to take that step in the end.",
                "Flink. But at least we can do so without treachery.",
                "Gran. I honestly believe that what we did was right. It may have\n        miscarried the first time, and may miscarry a second and a third; but it\n        is the only possible solution.",
                "Flink. You pronounced your doom in those words.",
                "Gran (more attentively). What do you mean by that?",

                "Gran. So that is it. -- I begin to understand you now.",
                "Flink. The republican party is broken up. For a generation it will be\n        annihilated by contempt. But a community without a republican party must\n        be one without ideals and without any aspirations towards truth in its\n        political life -- and in other respects as well! That is what you are\n        responsible for.",
                "Gran. You pay me too great a compliment.",
                "Flink. By no means! Your reputation, your personal qualities and\n        associations are what have seduced them.",
                "Gran. Listen to me for a moment! You used to overrate me in the hopes\n        you had of me. You are overrating me now in your censure. You are\n        overrating the effects of our failure -- you never seem to be able to\n        do anything but overshoot your mark. For that reason you are a danger to\n        your friends. You lure them on. When things go well you lure them on to\n        excess of activity; when things go ill, you turn their despondency into\n        despair. Your inordinate enthusiasm obscures your wits. You are\n        not called upon to sit in judgment upon any one; because you draw the\n        pure truths that lie hidden in your soul into such a frenzied vortex of\n        strife that you lose sight of them; and then they have so little of\n        truth left in them that in your hands they can be answerable for crimes.",
                "Flink. Oh, spare me your dialectics! -- because any skill you have in\n        them, I taught you! You cannot excuse your own sins by running\n        over the list of mine; that is the only answer I have to make to you! I\n        don't stand before you as the embodiment of truth; I am no braggart. No;\n        but simply as one who has loved you deeply and now is as deeply offended\n        by you, I ask this question of your conscience: What have you done with\n        the love we had for one another? Where is the sacred cause we both used\n        to uphold? Where is our honour -- our friends -- our future?",
                "Gran. I feel respect for your sorrow. Can you not feel any for mine? Or\n        do you suppose that I am not suffering?",
                "Flink. You cannot act as you have done without bringing unhappiness upon\n        yourself. But there are others to be considered besides you, and we have\n        the right to call you to account. Answer me!",
                "Gran. And is it really you -- you, my old friend -- that propose\n        to do that?",
                "Flink. God knows I would sooner some one else did it! But none can do it\n        so fitly as I -- because no one else has loved you as I have. I\n        expected too much of you, you say? The only thing I wanted of you was\n        that you should be faithful! I had so often been disappointed; but in\n        you and your quiet strength I thought I had splendid security that, as\n        long as you lived, our cause would bear itself proudly and confidently.\n        It was your prestige that brought it into being; your wealth that\n        supported it. It did not cry aloud for the blood of martyrs! -- You\n        were the happiness of my life; my soul renewed its strength from yours.",
                "Gran. Old friend -- !",
                "Flink. I was old, and you were young! Your nature was a harmonious whole -- it\n        was what I needed to lean upon.",
                "Gran. Flink, my dear old friend -- !",
                "Flink. And now, here you stand -- a broken man, and our whole cause\n        broken with you; all our lives broken -- at least mine is --",
                "Gran. Don't say that!",
                "Flink. You have destroyed my faith in mankind -- and in myself, for I\n        see what a mistake I made; but it will be the last I shall make! I took\n        you to my heart of hearts -- and now, the only thing I can do is to\n        call you to account!",
                "Gran. What do you want me to do? Tell me!",
                "Flink. We must stand face to face -- armed! You must die! (A pause.)",
                "Gran (without seeming greatly surprised). Of the two of us, it will go\n        hardest with you, old friend.",
                "Flink. You think your aim will be the surer of the two? (Goes towards\n        the table.)",
                "Gran. I was not thinking of that -- but of what your life would be\n        afterwards. I know you.",
                "Flink (opening the pistol-case). You need not be anxious! My life\n        afterwards will not be a long one. What you have done has robbed me of\n        anything to live for in this generation, and I don't aspire to live till\n        the next. So it is all over and done with! (Takes up the pistols.)",
                "Gran. Do you mean here -- ?",
                "Flink. Why not? We are alone here.",
                "Gran. The King is asleep in the next room. (Points to the door near his\n        desk.)",
                "Flink. The King here?",
                "Gran. He came here to-night.",
                "Flink. Well, it will wake him up; he will have to wake up some time, any\n        way.",
                "Gran. It would be horrible! No!",
                "Flink. Indeed? It is for his sake you have betrayed me. You did that as\n        soon as ever you met him again. He has bewitched you. Let him hear and\n        see what he has done! (Holds out the pistols.) Here!",
                "Gran. Wait. What you have just said brings a doubt into my mind. Is not\n        revenge, after all, the motive for what you are doing?",
                "Flink. Revenge?",
                "Gran. Yes. Don't misunderstand me; I am not trying to shuffle out of it.\n        If I were free to choose, I would choose death rather than anything\n        else. The King knows that, too. But I ask because there ought to be some\n        serious reason for anything that may happen. I am not going to stand up\n        and face a sentiment of revenge that is so ill-grounded.",
                "Flink (laying the pistols down). I hate the man who has led you astray -- that\n        is true. When I was giving you the reasons why I took upon myself the\n        task of calling you to account, perhaps I forgot that. I hate him. But\n        the instrument that carries out a sentence is one thing; the sentence\n        itself is quite another. You arc sentenced to death because you have\n        betrayed our cause -- and because you say that you were right to do\n        so. The world shall learn what that costs. It costs a man's life.",
                "Gran. So be it!",
                "Flink. The pistols are loaded. I loaded them myself. I imagine that you\n        still have trust in my honour?",
                "Gran (with a smile). Indeed I have.",
                "Flink. One of them has a blank cartridge in it; the other is fully\n        loaded. Choose!",
                "Gran. But what do you mean? Suppose I were to -- ?",
                "Flink. Don't be afraid! Heaven will decide! You will not choose\n        the fully loaded one! -- We shall stand face to face.",
                "Gran. You are settling everything -- the sentence, the challenge, the\n        choice of weapons, the regulations for the duel -- !",
                "Flink. Are you dissatisfied with that?",
                "Gran. By no means! You are quite welcome! We are to have no seconds? So\n        be it. But the place?",
                "Flink. The place? Here!",
                "Gran. Horrible!",
                "Flink. Why? (Holds out the two pistols to him. The door to the left is\n        opened softly. ANNA looks in, sees what is going on, and rushes with a\n        pitiful attempt at a scream to GRAN, putting her arms round him\n        protectingly, and caressing him with every sign of the utmost terror.)",
                "Gran (bending down and kissing her). She is right! Why should I die for\n        the sake of dull theories, when I can hold life in my arms as I do now?\n        A man who is loved has something left, after all. I won't die!",
                "Flink. If you were not loved, my friend, you might be allowed to live. A\n        cry of sorrow will be heard throughout the land, from the King's palace\n        to the meanest hovel, when you have been shot. And that is just why I\n        must do it! The louder the cry of sorrow, the greater will be the\n        silence afterwards. And in that silence is to be found the answer to the\n        question \"Why?\" The people will not allow themselves to be cheated any\n        longer.",
                "Gran. Horrible! I won't do it! (Lifts ANNA in his arms as if she were a\n        child.)",
                "Flink (going up to him). It is no mere theory that you are facing. Look\n        at me!",
                "Gran. Old friend -- must it be?",
                "Flink. It must. I have nothing else left to do.",
                "Gran. But not here.",
                "Flink. Since it cannot be here, then come out into the park. (Puts the\n        pistols into their case.) You owe me that.",
                "Gran (to ANNA). You must go, my dear!",
                "Flink (putting the pistol-case under his arm). No, let her stay here.\n        But you come! (They all three move towards the door. ANNA will not let\n        GRAN go, and there is a struggle until he, half commanding and half\n        entreating, persuades her to stay behind. The two men go out, shutting\n        the door after them. She throws herself against the door, but it has\n        been locked on the outside. She sinks down to the floor in despair, then\n        gets up, as if struck by a sudden idea, rushes into the room on the\n        right, and almost immediately re-appears, dragging the KING after her.\n        He is only half-dressed and has no shoes on.)",
                "The King. What is it? (A shot is heard.) What is it? (ANNA pulls him to\n        the door. He tries to open it, but in vain. She rushes to the window,\n        with the KING after her. Meanwhile the door is opened from outside, and\n        FALBE comes in, evidently overcome with emotion.) What is it, Falbe?\n        (ANNA runs out.)",
                "Falbe. His Excellency the Minister of the Interior --",
                "The King. Well, what of him?",
                "Falbe. -- has been assassinated!",
                "The King. The Minister of the Interior? -- Gran?",
                "Falbe. Yes.",
                "The King. Gran? -- What did you say?",
                "Falbe. He has been assassinated!",
                "The King. Gran? Impossible! -- Where? Why? I heard his voice only\n        just now, here!",
                "Falbe. That fellow shot him -- the grey-haired fellow -- the\n        republican",
                "The King. Flink? Yes, I heard his voice here too!",
                "Falbe. It was in the park! I saw it myself!",
                "The King. Saw it yourself? Wretch! (Rushes out.)",
                "Falbe. How could I prevent a madman -- ? (Follows the KING. The door\n        stands open, and through it a man is seen running past, calling out:\n        \"Where?\" Others follow him, and amidst the sound of hurrying feet, cries\n        are heard of \"Good God!\" -- \"In the park, did you say?\" -- \"A\n        doctor! Fetch a doctor!\" -- \"Who did it?\" -- \"That fellow running\n        towards the river!\" -- \"After him! After him!\" -- \"Fetch a barrow\n        from the works!\" -- After a while the KING returns alone, looking\n        distracted. He stands motionless and silent for some time.)",
                "The King. What a happy smile there was on his face! Just as she smiled! -- Yes,\n        it must be happiness! (Hides his face in his hands.) And he died for me\n        too! My two only -- . (Breaks down.) So that is the price they have\n        to pay for loving me! -- And at once! At once! -- Of course! Of\n        course! (The sound of the crowd returning is heard, and cries of: \"This\n        way!\" -- \"Into the blue room!\" Women and children come streaming in,\n        all in tears, surrounding ANNA and the men that are carrying GRAN'S\n        body, and follow them into the room on the left. Cries are heard of:\n        \"Why should he die?\" -- \"He was so good!\" -- \"What had he done to\n        deserve it!\" -- \"He was the best man in the world!\")",
                "The King. \"He was the best man in the world!\" Yes. And he died for my\n        sake! That means something good of me! -- the best possible! Are they\n        two together now, I wonder? Oh, let me have a sign! -- or is that too\n        much to ask? (The crowd come out again, sobbing and weeping, and cries\n        are heard of: \"He looks so beautiful and peaceful!\" -- \"I can't bring\n        myself to believe it!\" When they see the KING, they hush their voices,\n        and all go out as quietly as they can. When they have gone out, the\n        MAYOR's voice is heard asking: \"Is he in here?\" and an answer: \"No, in\n        the blue room, over there.\" Then the GENERAL'S voice: \"And the murderer\n        escaped?\" -- An answer: \"They are looking for him in the river!\" -- The\n        GENERAL'S voice: \"In the river? Did he jump into the river?\" -- The\n        PRIEST's voice: \"Shocking!\" A few moments later the GENERAL with BANG,\n        the MAYOR, and the PRIEST come in from the other room. They stop on\n        seeing the KING, who is standing at the desk with his back to them, and\n        whisper.)",
                "The General. Isn't that the King?",
                "The Others. The King?",
                "The Mayor. Is the King back? He must have come in the night!",
                "Bang. Let me see! -- I know him personally.",
                "The General (holding him back). Of course it is the King.",
                "The Mayor. Really?",
                "Bang. I recognise him by his agitation! It is he.",
                "The General. Hush! Let us go quietly out again! (They begin to move\n        off.)",
                "The Mayor. He is grieved. Naturally.",
                "Bang. First of all her death; and then this -- !",
                "The Priest. It is the judgment of heaven!",
                "The King (turning round). Who is that? What? (Comes forward.) Who said\n        that? (They all stop, take off their hats and bow.) Come back! (They\n        come back hastily.) Who said: \"It is the judgment of heaven\"?",
                "The General. Your Majesty must forgive us -- we were just taking a\n        little stroll; I am here to spend Christmas with my friend Mr. Bang, who\n        has a factory here -- a branch of his works -- and we happened to\n        meet the Mayor and the Priest, and we joined company -- and were\n        strolling along when we heard a shot. A shot. We did not think anything\n        more about it till we came nearer here and saw people running, and heard\n        a great outcry and disturbance. Great disturbance -- yes. We stopped,\n        of course, and came to see what it was. Came to see what it was, of\n        course. And they told us that the Minister of the Interior --",
                "The King. What is all that to me! (The GENERAL bows.) Who said: \"It is\n        the judgment of heaven\"? (No one speaks.) Come, answer me!",
                "The Mayor. It was the Priest -- I fancy.",
                "The King (to the PRIEST). Haven't you the courage to tell me so\n        yourself?",
                "The General. Probably our reverend friend is unaccustomed to find\n        himself in the presence of royalty.",
                "The Priest. It is the first time that -- that I have had the honour\n        of speaking to your Majesty -- I did not feel self-possessed enough,\n        for the moment, to --",
                "The King. But you were self-possessed enough when you said it! What did\n        you mean by saying it was \"the judgment of heaven\"? -- I am asking\n        you what you meant by it.",
                "The Priest. I really don't quite know -- it slipped out --",
                "The King. That is a lie! Some one said: \"First of all her death, and\n        then this.\" And you said: \"It is the judgment of heaven.\"",
                "The Mayor. That is quite right, your Majesty.",
                "The King. First of all her death? That meant the death of my\n        betrothed, didn't it?",
                "Bang and The Priest. Yes, your Majesty.",
                "The King. \"And then this\" meant my friend -- my dear friend!\n        (With emotion.) Why did heaven condemn these two to death? (A pause.)",
                "The General. It is most regrettable that we should, quite involuntarily,\n        have disturbed your Majesty at a moment when your Majesty's feelings\n        are, naturally, so overcome --",
                "The King (interrupting him). I asked you why heaven condemned these two\n        to death. (To the VICAR.) You are a clergyman; cudgel your brains!",
                "The Priest. Well, your Majesty, I was thinking that -- I meant that -- that\n        heaven had in a miraculous way checked your Majesty --",
                "The General. \"Ventured to check\" would be more suitable, I think.",
                "The Priest. -- from continuing in a course which many people thought\n        so unfortunate -- I mean, so fatal to the nation, and the church; had\n        checked your Majesty --",
                "The General (in an undertone). Ventured to check.",

                "The King. Confess that they express what you meant!",

                "The King. Pray to heaven that for a single day your thoughts may be as\n        pure as hers were every day. (Bursts into tears. Then says impetuously.)\n        How long have you been a clergyman?",
                "The Priest. Fifteen years, your Majesty.",
                "The King. Then you were already ordained at the time when I was leading\n        a dissolute life. Why did you never say anything to me then?",
                "The Priest. My most gracious King --",
                "The King. God is the only \"most gracious King\"! Do not speak blasphemy!",
                "The Priest. It was not my duty to --",
                "The General. Our friend is not a court chaplain. He has merely a parish\n        in the town here --",
                "The Mayor. And his work lies chiefly among the factory hands.",
                "The King. And so it is not your duty to speak the truth to me -- but\n        to attack my dear dead friends by prating about heaven's judgment and\n        repeating vile lies? Is that your duty?",

Ah, here comes a breath of truth! -- And\n        you come to me, my child, because you know that we two can mourn\n        together. But I do not weep, as you do; because I know that for a long\n        time he had been secretly praying for death. He has got his wish now. So\n        you must not weep so bitterly.

With my hand on the head of this poor creature, who\n        used to trust so unassumingly and devotedly to his goodness of heart, I\n        wish to say something in memory of my friend. (ANNA clings to him,\n        weeping. The others come respectfully nearer, and wait.) Gran was the\n        richest man in the country. Why was it that he had no fear of the\n        people? Why was it that he believed that its salvation lay in the\n        overthrow of the present state of affairs?",

Why did he, who has met his death, consider that the security\n        for his cash-box came from those below him, as long as he\n        did what was right, and not from those above him? Because he understood\n        the times. No question of selfishness stood in the way of his doing\n        that. -- That is my funeral oration over him! -- (To ANNA.) Get\n        up, my dear! Did you understand what I was saying? Do not weep so! (She\n        clings to him, sobbing.)",

But your Majesty may be certain that, though we may\n        not have been so fortunate as to see so far ahead and so clearly -- though\n        our mental horizon may be narrow -- we are none the less loyal to\n        your Majesty for that, nor less devoted! It is our duty as subjects to\n        say so, although your Majesty in your heaviness of heart seems to forget\n        it-seems to forget that we, too, look for everything from your Majesty's\n        favour, wisdom and justice. (Perspires freely.)",
                "The King. It is very strange! My dear friend never said anything like\n        that to me. (A pause.) He had the most prosperous business in the\n        country. When I came to him and asked him to abandon it, he did so at\n        once. And in the end he died for me. That is the sort of man he was. (To\n        ANNA.) Go in to him, my dear! You are the very picture of dumb loyalty.\n        Although I do not deserve to have such as you to watch by my side,\n        still, for the sake of him who is dead, I shall have you to do so when I\n        too -- .

Very well, then -- you are a\n        community of Christians; and it is not my fault if such a community\n        refuses to take any serious interest in what really affects\n        Christianity.

Ought to tear the falsehood away from it! Ought not to go in\n        crowds to stare at a coronation in a church, like apes grinning at a\n        peacock! I know what I felt at that moment. I had rehearsed it all once\n        that morning already -- ha, ha! Ask your Christianity if it may not\n        be about time for it to interest itself a little in the monarchy? It\n        seems to me that it scarcely ought any longer to allow monarchy, like a\n        seductive harlot, to keep militarism before the people's eyes as an\n        ideal -- seeing that that is exactly contrary to the teachings of\n        Christianity, or to encourage class divisions, luxury, hypocrisy and\n        vanity.

                "The General (to the Mayor). To have that from his Majesty's own mouth is\n        equivalent to seeing it gazetted. I am fortunate to be able to be the\n        first to congratulate you!",

                "The King. But what I mean is, could it not bring itself to do so?",
                "The Priest. If it did, it would lose sight of its inner aim. The\n        earliest communities are the model for a Christian people!",
                "The King (turning away from him). Oh, have any model you like, so long\n        as it leads to something!",
                "The General. I must say I am astonished at the penetration your Majesty\n        slows even into the deepest subjects.",
                "Bang. Yes, I have never heard anything like it! I have not had the\n        advantage of a university education, so I don't really understand it.",
                "The King. And to think that I imagined that I should find my allies, my\n        followers, in Christian people! One is so reluctant to give up all\n        hope! I thought that a Christian nation would storm the strongholds of\n        lies in our modern, so-called Christian communities -- storm them,\n        capture them! -- and begin with monarchy, because that would need\n        most courage, and because its falsehood lies deepest and goes farthest.\n        I thought that Christianity would one day prove to be the salt of the\n        earth. No, do not greet Christianity from me. I have said\n        nothing, and do not mean it. I am what men call a betrayed man -- betrayed\n        by all the most ideal powers of life. There! Now I have done!",
                "The General. But what does your Majesty mean? Betrayed? By whom? Who are\n        the traitors? Really -- !",
                "The King. Pooh! Think it over! -- As a matter of fact I am the only\n        one that has been foolish.",
                "Bang. Your Majesty, just now you were so full of vigour -- !",
                "The King. Don't let that astonish you, my friend! I am a mixture of\n        enthusiasm and world-weariness; the scion of a decrepit race is not\n        likely to be any better than that, you know! And as for being a reformer -- !\n        Ha, ha! Well, I thank you all for having listened to me so patiently.\n        Whatever I said had no significance -- except perhaps that, like the\n        oysters, I had to open my shell before I died. -- Good-bye!",
                "The General. I really cannot find it in my heart to leave your Majesty\n        when your Majesty is in so despondent a humour.",
                "The King. I am afraid you will have to try, my gallant friend! -- Don't\n        look so dejected, Mr. Mayor! -- Suppose some day serious-minded men\n        should feel just as humiliated at such falsehoods existing as you do now\n        because you have not been allowed to participate in them. I might\n        perhaps be able to endure being king then! But as things are now, I am\n        not strong enough for the job. I feel as if I had been shouldered out of\n        actual life on to this strip of carpet that I am standing on! That is\n        what my attempts at reform have ended in!",
                "The Mayor. May I be allowed to say that the impression made on my mind\n        by the somewhat painful scene we have just gone through is that your\n        Majesty is overwrought.",
                "The King. Mad, you mean?",
                "The Mayor. God forbid I should use such a word of my King!",
                "The King. Always punctilious! -- Well, judging by the fact that every\n        one else considers themselves sane, I must undoubtedly be the mad one.\n        It is as simple as a sum in arithmetic. -- And, in all conscience,\n        isn't it madness, when all is said and done, to take such trifles so\n        much to heart? -- to bother about a few miserable superannuated forms\n        that are not of the slightest importance? -- a few venerable,\n        harmless prejudices? -- a few foolish social customs and other\n        trumpery affairs of that sort?",
                "The General. Quite so!",
                "The Mayor. Your Majesty is absolutely right!",
                "Bang. I quite agree!",
                "The Priest. It is exactly what I have been thinking all the time.",
                "The King. And probably we had better add to the list certain extravagant\n        ideas -- perhaps even certain dangerous ideas, like mine about\n        Christianity?",
                "The Priest (hastily and impressively). Your Majesty is mistaken on the\n        subject of Christianity.",
                "The Mayor. Christianity is entirely a personal matter, your Majesty.",
                "The General. Your Majesty expects too much of it. Now, as a comfort for\n        the dying -- !",
                "The King. And a powerful instrument of discipline.",
                "The General (smiling). Ah, your Majesty!",
                "Bang (confidentially). Christianity is no longer such a serious matter\n        nowadays, except for certain persons -- . (Glances at the PRIEST.)",
                "The King. All I have to say on the head of such unanimous approval is\n        this: that in such a shallow society, where there is no particular\n        distinction between lies and truth, because most things are mere forms\n        without any deeper meaning -- where ideals are considered to be\n        extravagant, dangerous things -- it is not so very amusing to\n        be alive.",
                "The General. Oh, your Majesty! Really, you -- ! Ha, ha, ha!",
                "The King. Don't you agree with me? -- Ah, if only one could grapple\n        with it! -- but we should need to be many to do that, and better\n        equipped than I am.",
                "The General. Better equipped than your Majesty? Your Majesty is the most\n        gifted man in the whole country!",
                "All. Yes!",
                "The General. Yes -- your Majesty must excuse me -- I spoke\n        involuntarily!",
                "The Mayor. There was a tone running through all your Majesty said that\n        seemed to suggest that your Majesty was contemplating -- . (Breaks\n        off.)",
                "The King. -- going away? Yes.",
                "All. Going away?",
                "The General. And abdicating? For heaven's sake, your Majesty -- !",
                "Bang. That would mean handing us over to the crown prince -- the\n        pietist!",
                "The Priest (betraying his pleasure in spite of himself). And his mother!",
                "The King. You are pleased at the idea, parson! It will be a sight to see\n        her and her son prancing along, with all of you in your best clothes\n        following them! Hurrah!",
                "The General. Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!",
                "Bang. Ha-ha-ha! (Coughs.) I get such a cough when I laugh.",
                "The King (seriously). I had no intention of provoking laughter in the\n        presence of death. I can hear the sounds of mourning through the open\n        door.",
                "The Mayor. With all due respect to the church -- the vast majority of\n        the nation have no desire for things to come to that -- to the\n        accession of a pietist to the throne. If your Majesty threatens to\n        abdicate you will have us all at your feet.",
                "The General (with decision). The accession of a new king just now would\n        be universally considered a national calamity. I will wager my life on\n        that!",
                "Bang. And I too!",
                "The King. My excellent friends -- you must take the consequences of\n        your actions!",
                "The Mayor (despairingly). But this! Who ever imagined such a\n        thing?",
                "The General and Bang. No one -- no one!",
                "The King. So much the worse. What is it you are asking me to do? To stay\n        where I am, so as to keep another man down? Is that work for a man?\n        Shame!",
                "The Mayor (in distress). We ask more than that! Your Majesty is making a\n        fatal mistake! The whole of your Majesty's dissatisfaction springs from\n        the fact that you believe yourself to be deserted by your people because\n        the elections are going contrary to what your Majesty had hoped. Nothing\n        is further from the truth! The people fight shy of revolutionary ideas;\n        but they love their King!",
                "Bang. They love their King!",
                "The King. And that white dove, who came confidently to my hand -- she\n        had some experience of what their love was!",
                "The Mayor. The King's associates may displease the people; ideas may\n        alter; but love for their King endures!",
                "The Others. Endures!",
                "The King. Cease! Cease!",
                "The General (warmly). Your Majesty may command us to do anything except\n        refrain from giving utterance to a free people's freely offered homage\n        of devotion, loyalty, and love for its royal house!",
                "The Mayor (emotionally). There is no one who would not give his life for\n        his King!",
                "Bang, The General, and The Priest. No one!",
                "The General. Try us! (They all press forward.)",
                "The King. Done with you! (Takes a revolver from his pocket.) Since\n        yesterday I have carried this little thing in my pocket. (They all look\n        alarmed.)",
                "The Priest. Merciful heavens!",
                "The King (holding out the revolver to him). Will you die for me? If so,\n        I will continue to be King.",
                "The Priest. I? What does your Majesty mean? It would be a great sin!",
                "The King. You love me, I suppose?",
                "All (desperately). Yes, your Majesty!",
                "The King. Those who love, believe. Therefore, believe me when I say\n        this: If there is a single one of you who, without thinking twice about\n        it, will die for his King now -- here -- at once -- then I\n        shall consider that as a command laid upon me to go on living and\n        working.",
                "The Mayor (in a terrified whisper). He is insane!",
                "The General (whispers). Yes!",
                "The King. I can hear you! -- But I suppose you love your King, even\n        if he is insane?",
                "All (in agitated tones). Yes, your Majesty!",
                "The King. Majesty, majesty! There is only One who has any majesty about\n        Him -- certainly not a madman! But if I have been driven mad by the\n        lies that surround me, it would be a holy deed to make me sound again.\n        You said you would die for me. Redeem your words! That will make me well\n        again! -- You, General?",
                "The General. My beloved King, it would be -- as our reverend friend\n        so aptly put it -- a most dreadful sin.",
                "The King. You have let slip a splendid opportunity for showing your\n        heroism. -- You ought to have seen that I was only putting you to the\n        test! -- Good-bye! (Goes into the room on the left.)",
                "The General. Absolutely insane!",
                "The Others. Absolutely.",
                "The Mayor. Such great abilities, too! What might not have been made of\n        him!",
                "Bang. The pity of it!",
                "The Priest. I got so alarmed.",
                "Bang. So did I! (A loud pistol-shot is heard.)",
                "The Priest. Another shot? (A pitiful woman's cry is heard from the other\n        room.)",
                "The Mayor. What on earth was that?",
                "Bang. I daren't think!",
                "The Priest. Nor I! (An old woman rushes out of the room on the left,\n        calling out: \"Help! -- Help! -- The King!\" and hurries out at the\n        back, calling: \"The King! Help, help!\" The GENERAL and the MAYOR rush\n        into the other room. Voices are heard outside asking: \"The King? -- Was\n        it the King?\" The confusion and uproar grows. In the midst of it ANNA\n        comes stumbling out of the other room, her hands stretched out before\n        her, as if she did not know where she was going. The noise and confusion\n        grows louder every minute, and crowds of people come rushing into the\n        room from outside as the Curtain falls.)"
