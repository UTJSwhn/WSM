                "IT is not my intention to write a treatise on apiculture, or on practical\n      bee-keeping. Excellent works of the kind abound in all civilised\n      countries, and it were useless to attempt another. France has those of\n      Dadant, Georges de Layens and Bonnier, Bertrand, Hamet, Weber, Clement,\n      the Abbe Collin, etc. English-speaking countries have Langstroth, Bevan,\n      Cook, Cheshire, Cowan, Root, etc. Germany has Dzierzon, Van Berlespoch,\n      Pollmann, Vogel, and many others.",
                "Nor is this book to be a scientific monograph on Apis Mellifica,\n      Ligustica, Fasciata, Dorsata, etc., or a collection of new observations\n      and studies. I shall say scarcely anything that those will not know who\n      are somewhat familiar with bees. The notes and experiments I have made\n      during my twenty years of beekeeping I shall reserve for a more technical\n      work; for their interest is necessarily of a special and limited nature,\n      and I am anxious not to over-burden this essay. I wish to speak of the\n      bees very simply, as one speaks of a subject one knows and loves to those\n      who know it not. I do not intend to adorn the truth, or merit the just\n      reproach Reaumur addressed to his predecessors in the study of our\n      honey-flies, whom he accused of substituting for the marvellous reality\n      marvels that were imaginary and merely plausible. The fact that the hive\n      contains so much that is wonderful does not warrant our seeking to add to\n      its wonders. Besides, I myself have now for a long time ceased to look for\n      anything more beautiful in this world, or more interesting, than the\n      truth; or at least than the effort one is able to make towards the truth.\n      I shall state nothing, therefore, that I have not verified myself, or that\n      is not so fully accepted in the text-books as to render further\n      verification superfluous. My facts shall be as accurate as though they\n      appeared in a practical manual or scientific monograph, but I shall relate\n      them in a somewhat livelier fashion than such works would allow, shall\n      group them more harmoniously together, and blend them with freer and more\n      mature reflections. The reader of this book will not learn therefrom how\n      to manage a hive; but he will know more or less all that can with any\n      certainty be known of the curious, profound, and intimate side of its\n      inhabitants. Nor will this be at the cost of what still remains to be\n      learned. I shall pass over in silence the hoary traditions that, in the\n      country and many a book, still constitute the legend of the hive. Whenever\n      there be doubt, disagreement, hypothesis, when I arrive at the unknown, I\n      shall declare it loyally; you will find that we often shall halt before\n      the unknown. Beyond the appreciable facts of their life we know but little\n      of the bees. And the closer our acquaintance becomes, the nearer is our\n      ignorance brought to us of the depths of their real existence; but such\n      ignorance is better than the other kind, which is unconscious, and\n      satisfied.",
                "Does an analogous work on the bee exist? I believe I have read almost all\n      that has been written on bees; but of kindred matter I know only\n      Michelet's chapter at the end of his book \"The Insect,\" and Ludwig\n      Buchner's essay in his \"Mind in Animals.\" Michelet merely hovers on the\n      fringe of his subject; Buchner's treatise is comprehensive enough, but\n      contains so many hazardous statements, so much long-discarded gossip and\n      hearsay, that I suspect him of never having left his library, never having\n      set forth himself to question his heroines, or opened one of the many\n      hundreds of rustling, wing-lit hives which we must profane before our\n      instinct can be attuned to their secret, before we can perceive the spirit\n      and atmosphere, perfume and mystery, of these virgin daughters of toil.\n      The book smells not of the bee, or its honey; and has the defects of many\n      a learned work, whose conclusions often are preconceived, and whose\n      scientific attainment is composed of a vast array of doubtful anecdotes\n      collected on every side. But in this essay of mine we rarely shall meet\n      each other; for our starting-point, our aim, and our point of view are all\n      very different.",
                "{2}",
                "The bibliography of the bee (we will begin with the books so as to get rid\n      of them as soon as we can and go to the source of the books) is very\n      extensive. From the beginning this strange little creature, that lived in\n      a society under complicated laws and executed prodigious labours in the\n      darkness, attracted the notice of men. Aristotle, Cato, Varro, Pliny,\n      Columella, Palladius all studied the bees; to say nothing of Aristomachus,\n      who, according to Cicero, watched them for fifty-eight years, and of\n      Phyliscus, whose writings are lost. But these dealt rather with the legend\n      of the bee; and all that we can gather therefrom -- which indeed is\n      exceedingly little -- we may find condensed in the fourth book of\n      Virgil's Georgics.",
                "The real history of the bee begins in the seventeenth century, with the\n      discoveries of the great Dutch savant Swammerdam. It is well, however, to\n      add this detail, but little known: before Swammerdam a Flemish naturalist\n      named Clutius had arrived at certain important truths, such as the sole\n      maternity of the queen and her possession of the attributes of both sexes,\n      but he had left these unproved. Swammerdam founded the true methods of\n      scientific investigation; he invented the microscope, contrived injections\n      to ward off decay, was the first to dissect the bees, and by the discovery\n      of the ovaries and the oviduct definitely fixed the sex of the queen,\n      hitherto looked upon as a king, and threw the whole political scheme of\n      the hive into most unexpected light by basing it upon maternity. Finally\n      he produced woodcuts and engravings so perfect that to this day they serve\n      to illustrate many books on apiculture. He lived in the turbulent,\n      restless Amsterdam of those days, regretting \"Het Zoete Buiten Leve \" -- The\n      Sweet Life of the Country -- and died, worn-out with work, at the age\n      of forty-three. He wrote in a pious, formal style, with beautiful, simple\n      outbursts of a faith that, fearful of falling away, ascribed all things to\n      the glory of the Creator; and embodied his observations and studies in his\n      great work \"Bybel der Natuure,\" which the doctor Boerhave, a century\n      later, caused to be translated from the Dutch into Latin under the title\n      of \"Biblia Naturae.\" (Leyden, 1737.)",
                "Then came Reaumur, who, pursuing similar methods, made a vast number of\n      curious experiments and researches in his gardens at Charenton, and\n      devoted to the bees an entire volume of his \"Notes to Serve for a History\n      of Insects.\" One may read it with profit to-day, and without fatigue. It\n      is clear, direct, and sincere, and possessed of a certain hard, arid charm\n      of its own. He sought especially the destruction of ancient errors; he\n      himself was responsible for several new ones; he partially understood the\n      formation of swarms and the political establishment of queens; in a word,\n      he discovered many difficult truths, and paved the way for the discovery\n      of more. He fully appreciated the marvellous architecture of the hive; and\n      what he said on the subject has never been better said. It is to him, too,\n      that we owe the idea of the glass hives, which, having since been\n      perfected, enable us to follow the entire private life of these fierce\n      insects, whose work, begun in the dazzling sunshine, receives its crown in\n      the darkness. To be comprehensive, one should mention also the somewhat\n      subsequent works and investigations of Charles Bonnet and Schirach (who\n      solved the enigma of the royal egg); but I will keep to the broad lines,\n      and pass at once to Francois Huber, the master and classic of contemporary\n      apiarian science.",
                "Huber was born in Geneva in 1750, and fell blind in his earliest youth.\n      The experiments of Reaumur interested him; he sought to verify them, and\n      soon becoming passionately absorbed in these researches, eventually, with\n      the assistance of an intelligent and faithful servant, Francois Burnens,\n      devoted his entire life to the study of the bee. In the annals of human\n      suffering and human triumph there is nothing more touching, no lesson more\n      admirable, than the story of this patient collaboration, wherein the one\n      who saw only with immaterial light guided with his spirit the eyes and\n      hands of the other who had the real earthly vision; where he who, as we\n      are assured, had never with his own eyes beheld a comb of honey, was yet\n      able, notwithstanding the veil on his dead eyes that rendered double the\n      veil in which nature enwraps all things, to penetrate the profound secrets\n      of the genius that had made this invisible comb; as though to teach us\n      that no condition in life can warrant our abandoning our desire and search\n      for the truth. I will not enumerate all that apiarian science owes to\n      Huber; to state what it does not owe were the briefer task. His \"New\n      Observations on Bees,\" of which the first volume was written in 1789, in\n      the form of letters to Charles Bonnet, the second not appearing till\n      twenty years later, have remained the unfailing, abundant treasure into\n      which every subsequent writer has dipped. And though a few mistakes may be\n      found therein, a few incomplete truths; though since his time considerable\n      additions have been made to the micrography and practical culture of bees,\n      the handling of queens, etc., there is not a single one of his principal\n      statements that has been disproved, or discovered in error; and in our\n      actual experience they stand untouched, and indeed at its very foundation.",
                "{3}",
                "Some years of silence followed these revelations; but soon a German\n      clergyman, Dzierzon, discovered parthenogenesis, i. e. the virginal\n      parturition of queens, and contrived the first hive with movable combs,\n      thereby enabling the bee-keeper henceforth to take his share of the\n      harvest of honey, without being forced to destroy his best colonies and in\n      one instant annihilate the work of an entire year. This hive, still very\n      imperfect, received masterly improvement at the hands of Langstroth, who\n      invented the movable frame properly so called, which has been adopted in\n      America with extraordinary success. Root, Quinby, Dadant, Cheshire, De\n      Layens, Cowan, Heddon, Howard, etc., added still further and precious\n      improvement. Then it occurred to Mehring that if bees were supplied with\n      combs that had an artificial waxen foundation, they would be spared the\n      labour of fashioning the wax and constructing the cells, which costs them\n      much honey and the best part of their time; he found that the bees\n      accepted these combs most readily, and adapted them to their requirements.",
                "Major de Hruschka invented the Honey-Extractor, which enables the honey to\n      be withdrawn by centrifugal force without breaking the combs, etc. And\n      thus, in a few years, the methods of apiculture underwent a radical\n      change. The capacity and fruitfulness of the hives were trebled. Great and\n      productive apiaries arose on every side. An end was put to the useless\n      destruction of the most industrious cities, and to the odious selection of\n      the least fit which was its result. Man truly became the master of the\n      bees, although furtively, and without their knowledge; directing all\n      things without giving an order, receiving obedience but not recognition.\n      For the destiny once imposed by the seasons he has substituted his will.\n      He repairs the injustice of the year, unites hostile republics, and\n      equalises wealth. He restricts or augments the births, regulates the\n      fecundity of the queen, dethrones her and instals another in her place,\n      after dexterously obtaining the reluctant consent of a people who would be\n      maddened at the mere suspicion of an inconceivable intervention. When he\n      thinks fit, he will peacefully violate the secret of the sacred chambers,\n      and the elaborate, tortuous policy of the palace. He will five or six\n      times in succession deprive the bees of the fruit of their labour, without\n      harming them, without their becoming discouraged or even impoverished. He\n      proportions the store-houses and granaries of their dwellings to the\n      harvest of flowers that the spring is spreading over the dip of the hills.\n      He compels them to reduce the extravagant number of lovers who await the\n      birth of the royal princesses. In a word he does with them what he will,\n      he obtains what he will, provided always that what he seeks be in\n      accordance with their laws and their virtues; for beyond all the desires\n      of this strange god who has taken possession of them, who is too vast to\n      be seen and too alien to be understood, their eyes see further than the\n      eyes of the god himself; and their one thought is the accomplishment, with\n      untiring sacrifice, of the mysterious duty of their race.",
                "{4}",
                "Let us now, having learned from books all that they had to teach us of a\n      very ancient history, leave the science others have acquired and look at\n      the bees with our own eyes. An hour spent in the midst of the apiary will\n      be less instructive, perhaps; but the things we shall see will be\n      infinitely more stimulating and more actual.",
                "I have not yet forgotten the first apiary I saw, where I learned to love\n      the bees. It was many years ago, in a large village of Dutch Flanders, the\n      sweet and pleasant country whose love for brilliant colour rivals that of\n      Zealand even, the concave mirror of Holland; a country that gladly spreads\n      out before us, as so many pretty, thoughtful toys, her illuminated gables,\n      and waggons, and towers; her cupboards and clocks that gleam at the end of\n      the passage; her little trees marshalled in line along quays and\n      canal-banks, waiting, one almost might think, for some quiet, beneficent\n      ceremony; her boats and her barges with sculptured poops, her flower-like\n      doors and windows, immaculate dams, and elaborate, many-coloured\n      drawbridges; and her little varnished houses, bright as new pottery, from\n      which bell-shaped dames come forth, all a-glitter with silver and gold, to\n      milk the cows in the white-hedged fields, or spread the linen on flowery\n      lawns, cut into patterns of oval and lozenge, and most astoundingly green.",
                "To this spot, where life would seem more restricted than elsewhere -- if\n      it be possible for life indeed to become restricted -- a sort of aged\n      philosopher had retired; an old man somewhat akin to Virgil's --",
                "\"Man equal to kings, and approaching the gods;\"",
                "whereto Lafontaine might have added, --",
                "\"And, like the gods, content and at rest.\"",
                "Here had he built his refuge, being a little weary; not disgusted, for the\n      large aversions are unknown to the sage; but a little weary of\n      interrogating men, whose answers to the only interesting questions one can\n      put concerning nature and her veritable laws are far less simple than\n      those that are given by animals and plants. His happiness, like the\n      Scythian philosopher's, lay all in the beauties of his garden; and\n      best-loved and visited most often, was the apiary, composed of twelve\n      domes of straw, some of which he had painted a bright pink, and some a\n      clear yellow, but most of all a tender blue; having noticed, long before\n      Sir John Lubbock's demonstrations, the bees' fondness for this colour.",
                "These hives stood against the wall of the house, in the angle formed by\n      one of those pleasant and graceful Dutch kitchens whose earthenware\n      dresser, all bright with copper and tin, reflected itself through the open\n      door on to the peaceful canal. And the water, burdened with these familiar\n      images beneath its curtain of poplars, led one's eyes to a calm horizon of\n      mills and of meadows.",
                "Here, as in all places, the hives lent a new meaning to the flowers and\n      the silence, the balm of the air and the rays of the sun. One seemed to\n      have drawn very near to the festival spirit of nature. One was content to\n      rest at this radiant crossroad, where the aerial ways converge and divide\n      that the busy and tuneful bearers of all country perfumes unceasingly\n      travel from dawn unto dusk. One heard the musical voice of the garden,\n      whose loveliest hours revealed their rejoicing soul and sang of their\n      gladness. One came hither, to the school of the bees, to be taught the\n      preoccupations of all-powerful nature, the harmonious concord of the three\n      kingdoms, the indefatigable organisation of life, and the lesson of ardent\n      and disinterested work; and another lesson too, with a moral as good, that\n      the heroic workers taught there, and emphasised, as it were, with the\n      fiery darts of their myriad wings, was to appreciate the somewhat vague\n      savour of leisure, to enjoy the almost unspeakable delights of those\n      immaculate days that revolved on themselves in the fields of space,\n      forming merely a transparent globe, as void of memory as the happiness\n      without alloy.",
                "{5}",
                "In order to follow, as simply as possible, the life of the bees through\n      the year, we will take a hive that awakes in the spring and duly starts on\n      its labours; and then we shall meet, in their natural order, all the great\n      episodes, viz.: the formation and departure of the swarm, the foundation\n      of the new city, the birth, combat and nuptial flight of the young queens,\n      the massacre of the males, and finally, the return of the sleep of winter.\n      With each of these episodes there will go the necessary explanations as to\n      the laws, habits, peculiarities and events that produce and accompany it;\n      so that, when arrived at the end of the bee's short year, which extends\n      only from April to the last days of September, we shall have gazed upon\n      all the mysteries of the palace of honey. Before we open it, therefore,\n      and throw a general glance around, we only need say that the hive is\n      composed of a queen, the mother of all her people; of thousands of workers\n      or neuters who are incomplete and sterile females; and lastly of some\n      hundreds of males, from whom one shall be chosen as the sole and\n      unfortunate consort of the queen that the workers will elect in the\n      future, after the more or less voluntary departure of the reigning mother.",
                "{6}",
                "The first time that we open a hive there comes over us an emotion akin to\n      that we might feel at profaning some unknown object, charged perhaps with\n      dreadful surprise, as a tomb. A legend of menace and peril still clings to\n      the bees. There is the distressful recollection of her sting, which\n      produces a pain so characteristic that one knows not wherewith to compare\n      it; a kind of destroying dryness, a flame of the desert rushing over the\n      wounded limb, as though these daughters of the sun had distilled a\n      dazzling poison from their father's angry rays, in order more effectively\n      to defend the treasure they gather from his beneficent hours.",
                "It is true that were some one who neither knows nor respects the customs\n      and character of the bee suddenly to fling open the hive, it would turn at\n      once into a burning bush of heroism and anger; but the slight amount of\n      skill needed to handle it with impunity can be most readily acquired. Let\n      but a little smoke be deftly applied, much coolness and gentleness be\n      shown, and our well-armed workers will suffer themselves to be despoiled\n      without dreaming of drawing their sting. It is not the fact, as some have\n      maintained, that the bees recognise their master; nor have they any fear\n      of man; but at the smell of the smoke, at the large slow gestures that\n      traverse their dwellings without threatening them, they imagine that this\n      is not the attack of an enemy against whom defence is possible, but that\n      it is a force or a natural catastrophe whereto they do well to submit.",
                "Instead of vainly struggling, therefore, they do what they can to\n      safeguard the future; and, obeying a foresight that for once is in error,\n      they fly to their reserves of honey, into which they eagerly dip in order\n      to possess within themselves the wherewithal to start a new city,\n      immediately and no matter where, should the ancient one be destroyed or\n      they be compelled to forsake it.",
                "{7}",
                "The first impression of the novice before whom an observation-hive* is\n      opened will be one of some disappointment. He had been told that this\n      little glass case contained an unparalleled activity, an infinite number\n      of wise laws, and a startling amalgam of mystery, experience, genius,\n      calculation, science, of various industries, of certitude and prescience,\n      of intelligent habits and curious feelings and virtues. All that he sees\n      is a confused mass of little reddish groups, somewhat resembling roasted\n      coffee-berries, or bunches of raisins piled against the glass. They look\n      more dead than alive; their movements are slow, incoherent, and\n      incomprehensible. Can these be the wonderful drops of light he had seen\n      but a moment ago, unceasingly flashing and sparkling, as they darted among\n      the pearls and the gold of a thousand wide-open calyces?",
                "By observation-hive is meant a hive of glass, furnished with black\n      curtains or shutters. The best kind have only one comb, thus permitting\n      both faces to be studied. These hives can be placed in a drawing-room,\n      library, etc., without inconvenience or danger. The bees that inhabit the\n      one I have in my study in Paris are able even in the stony desert of that\n      great city, to find the wherewithal to nourish themselves and to prosper.",
                "They appear to be shivering in the darkness, to be numbed, suffocated, so\n      closely are they huddled together; one might fancy they were ailing\n      captives, or queens dethroned, who have had their one moment of glory in\n      the midst of their radiant garden, and are now compelled to return to the\n      shameful squalor of their poor overcrowded home.",
                "It is with them as with all that is deeply real; they must be studied, and\n      one must learn how to study them. The inhabitant of another planet who\n      should see men and women coming and going almost imperceptibly through our\n      streets, crowding at certain times around certain buildings, or waiting\n      for one knows not what, without apparent movement, in the depths of their\n      dwellings, might conclude therefrom that they, too, were miserable and\n      inert. It takes time to distinguish the manifold activity contained in\n      this inertia.",
                "And indeed every one of the little almost motionless groups in the hive is\n      incessantly working, each at a different trade. Repose is unknown to any;\n      and such, for instance, as seem the most torpid, as they hang in dead\n      clusters against the glass, are intrusted with the most mysterious and\n      fatiguing task of all: it is they who secrete and form the wax. But the\n      details of this universal activity will be given in their place. For the\n      moment we need only call attention to the essential trait in the nature of\n      the bee which accounts for the extraordinary agglomeration of the various\n      workers. The bee is above all, and even to a greater extent than the ant,\n      a creature of the crowd. She can live only in the midst of a multitude.\n      When she leaves the hive, which is so densely packed that she has to force\n      her way with blows of her head through the living walls that enclose her,\n      she departs from her proper element. She will dive for an instant into\n      flower-filled space, as the swimmer will dive into the sea that is filled\n      with pearls, but under pain of death it behoves her at regular intervals\n      to return and breathe the crowd as the swimmer must return and breathe the\n      air. Isolate her, and however abundant the food or favourable the\n      temperature, she will expire in a few days not of hunger or cold, but of\n      loneliness. From the crowd, from the city, she derives an invisible\n      aliment that is as necessary to her as honey. This craving will help to\n      explain the spirit of the laws of the hive. For in them the individual is\n      nothing, her existence conditional only, and herself, for one indifferent\n      moment, a winged organ of the race. Her whole life is an entire sacrifice\n      to the manifold, everlasting being whereof she forms part. It is strange\n      to note that it was not always so. We find even to-day, among the\n      melliferous hymenoptera, all the stages of progressive civilisation of our\n      own domestic bee. At the bottom of the scale we find her working alone, in\n      wretchedness, often not seeing her offspring (the Prosopis, the Colletes,\n      etc.); sometimes living in the midst of the limited family that she\n      produces annually (as in the case of the humble-bee). Then she forms\n      temporary associations (the Panurgi, the Dasypodoe, the Hacliti, etc.) and\n      at last we arrive, through successive stages, at the almost perfect but\n      pitiless society of our hives, where the individual is entirely merged in\n      the republic, and the republic in its turn invariably sacrificed to the\n      abstract and immortal city of the future.",

                "Let us not too hastily deduce from these facts conclusions that apply to\n      man. He possesses the power of withstanding certain of nature's laws; and\n      to know whether such resistance be right or wrong is the gravest and\n      obscurest point in his morality. But it is deeply interesting to discover\n      what the will of nature may be in a different world; and this will is\n      revealed with extraordinary clearness in the evolution of the hymenoptera,\n      which, of all the inhabitants of this globe, possess the highest degree of\n      intellect after that of man. The aim of nature is manifestly the\n      improvement of the race; but no less manifest is her inability, or\n      refusal, to obtain such improvement except at the cost of the liberty, the\n      rights, and the happiness of the individual. In proportion as a society\n      organises itself, and rises in the scale, so does a shrinkage enter the\n      private life of each one of its members. Where there is progress, it is\n      the result only of a more and more complete sacrifice of the individual to\n      the general interest. Each one is compelled, first of all, to renounce his\n      vices, which are acts of independence. For instance, at the last stage but\n      one of apiarian civilisation, we find the humble-bees, which are like our\n      cannibals. The adult workers are incessantly hovering around the eggs,\n      which they seek to devour, and the mother has to display the utmost\n      stubbornness in their defence. Then having freed himself from his most\n      dangerous vices, each individual has to acquire a certain number of more\n      and more painful virtues. Among the humble-bees, for instance, the workers\n      do not dream of renouncing love, whereas our domestic bee lives in a state\n      of perpetual chastity. And indeed we soon shall show how much more she has\n      to abandon, in exchange for the comfort and security of the hive, for its\n      architectural, economic, and political perfection; and we shall return to\n      the evolution of the hymenoptera in the chapter devoted to the progress of\n      the species."

                "Here, then, they have shaken off the torpor of winter. The queen started\n      laying again in the very first days of February, and the workers have\n      flocked to the willows and nut-trees, gorse and violets, anemones and\n      lungworts. Then spring invades the earth, and cellar and stream with honey\n      and pollen, while each day beholds the birth of thousands of bees. The\n      overgrown males now all sally forth from their cells, and disport\n      themselves on the combs; and so crowded does the too prosperous city\n      become that hundreds of belated workers, coming back from the flowers\n      towards evening, will vainly seek shelter within, and will be forced to\n      spend the night on the threshold, where they will be decimated by the\n      cold. Restlessness seizes the people, and the old queen begins to stir.\n      She feels that a new destiny is being prepared. She has religiously\n      fulfilled her duty as a good creatress; and from this duty done there\n      result only tribulation and sorrow. An invincible power menaces her\n      tranquillity; she will soon be forced to quit this city of hers, where she\n      has reigned. But this city is her work, it is she, herself. She is not its\n      queen in the sense in which men use the word. She issues no orders; she\n      obeys, as meekly as the humblest of her subjects, the masked power,\n      sovereignly wise, that for the present, and till we attempt to locate it,\n      we will term the \"spirit of the hive.\" But she is the unique organ of\n      love; she is the mother of the city. She founded it amid uncertainty and\n      poverty. She has peopled it with her own substance; and all who move\n      within its walls -- workers, males, larvae, nymphs, and the young\n      princesses whose approaching birth will hasten her own departure, one of\n      them being already designed as her successor by the \"spirit of the hive\" -- all\n      these have issued from her flanks.",

Nor is it a kind of mechanical habit of the race, or blind\n      craving for life, that will fling the bees upon any wild hazard the moment\n      an unforeseen event shall derange the accustomed order of phenomena. On\n      the contrary, be the event never so masterful, the \"spirit of the hive\"\n      still will follow it, step by step, like an alert and quickwitted slave,\n      who is able to derive advantage even from his master's most dangerous\n      orders.",

It regulates day by day the number of\n      births, and contrives that these shall strictly accord with the number of\n      flowers that brighten the country-side. It decrees the queen's deposition\n      or warns her that she must depart; it compels her to bring her own rivals\n      into the world, and rears them royally, protecting them from their\n      mother's political hatred. So, too, in accordance with the generosity of\n      the flowers, the age of the spring, and the probable dangers of the\n      nuptial flight, will it permit or forbid the first-born of the virgin\n      princesses to slay in their cradles her younger sisters, who are singing\n      the song of the queens. At other times, when the season wanes, and flowery\n      hours grow shorter, it will command the workers themselves to slaughter\n      the whole imperial brood, that the era of revolutions may close, and work\n      become the sole object of all. The \"spirit of the hive\" is prudent and\n      thrifty, but by no means parsimonious. And thus, aware, it would seem,\n      that nature's laws are somewhat wild and extravagant in all that pertains\n      to love, it tolerates, during summer days of abundance, the embarrassing\n      presence in the hive of three or four hundred males, from whose ranks the\n      queen about to be born shall select her lover; three or four hundred\n      foolish, clumsy, useless, noisy creatures, who are pretentious,\n      gluttonous, dirty, coarse, totally and scandalously idle, insatiable, and\n      enormous.",

It regulates the workers' labours,\n      with due regard to their age; it allots their task to the nurses who tend\n      the nymphs and the larvae, the ladies of honour who wait on the queen and\n      never allow her out of their sight; the house-bees who air, refresh, or\n      heat the hive by fanning their wings, and hasten the evaporation of the\n      honey that may be too highly charged with water; the architects, masons,\n      wax-workers, and sculptors who form the chain and construct the combs; the\n      foragers who sally forth to the flowers in search of the nectar that turns\n      into honey, of the pollen that feeds the nymphs and the larvae, the\n      propolis that welds and strengthens the buildings of the city, or the\n      water and salt required by the youth of the nation. Its orders have gone\n      to the chemists who ensure the preservation of the honey by letting a drop\n      of formic acid fall in from the end of their sting; to the capsule-makers\n      who seal down the cells when the treasure is ripe, to the sweepers who\n      maintain public places and streets most irreproachably clean, to the\n      bearers whose duty it is to remove the corpses; and to the amazons of the\n      guard who keep watch on the threshold by night and by day, question comers\n      and goers, recognise the novices who return from their very first flight,\n      scare away vagabonds, marauders and loiterers, expel all intruders, attack\n      redoubtable foes in a body, and, if need be, barricade the entrance.",
                "Finally, it is the spirit of the hive that fixes the hour of the great\n      annual sacrifice to the genius of the race: the hour, that is, of the\n      swarm; when we find a whole people, who have attained the topmost pinnacle\n      of prosperity and power, suddenly abandoning to the generation to come\n      their wealth and their palaces, their homes and the fruits of their\n      labour; themselves content to encounter the hardships and perils of a new\n      and distant country. This act, be it conscious or not, undoubtedly passes\n      the limits of human morality. Its result will sometimes be ruin, but\n      poverty always; and the thrice-happy city is scattered abroad in obedience\n      to a law superior to its own happiness. Where has this law been decreed,\n      which, as we soon shall find, is by no means as blind and inevitable as\n      one might believe? Where, in what assembly, what council, what\n      intellectual and moral sphere, does this spirit reside to whom all must\n      submit, itself being vassal to an heroic duty, to an intelligence whose\n      eyes are persistently fixed on the future?",

And then we imagine we know them, and ask\n      nothing more. We watch them hasten from flower to flower, we see the\n      constant agitation within the hive; their life seems very simple to us,\n      and bounded, like every life, by the instinctive cares of reproduction and\n      nourishment.

From the height of a dome more colossal than\n      that of St. Peter's at Rome waxen walls descend to the ground, balanced in\n      the void and the darkness; gigantic and manifold, vertical and parallel\n      geometric constructions, to which, for relative precision, audacity, and\n      vastness, no human structure is comparable. Each of these walls, whose\n      substance still is immaculate and fragrant, of virginal, silvery\n      freshness, contains thousands of cells, that are stored with provisions\n      sufficient to feed the whole people for several weeks. Here, lodged in\n      transparent cells, are the pollens, love-ferment of every flower of\n      spring, making brilliant splashes of red and yellow, of black and mauve.\n      Close by, in twenty thousand reservoirs, sealed with a seal that shall\n      only be broken on days of supreme distress, the honey of April is stored,\n      most limpid and perfumed of all, wrapped round with long and magnificent\n      embroidery of gold, whose borders hang stiff and rigid. Still lower the\n      honey of May matures, in great open vats, by whose side watchful cohorts\n      maintain an incessant current of air. In the centre, and far from the\n      light whose diamond rays steal in through the only opening, in the warmest\n      part of the hive, there stands the abode of the future; here does it\n      sleep, and wake. For this is the royal domain of the brood-cells, set\n      apart for the queen and her acolytes; about 10,000 cells wherein the eggs\n      repose, 15,000 or 16,000 chambers tenanted by larvae, 40,000 dwellings\n      inhabited by white nymphs to whom thousands of nurses minister.* And\n      finally, in the holy of holies of these partss are the three, four, six,\n      or twelve sealed palaces, vast in size compared with the others, where the\n      adolescent princesses lie who await their hour, wrapped in a kind of\n      shroud, all of them motionless and pale, and fed in the darkness.",

These things result from the bee's discovery that work\n      among distant flowers, whereof many hundreds must be visited to form one\n      drop of honey, is not the only or promptest method of acquiring wealth,\n      but that it is easier to enter ill-guarded cities by stratagem, or force\n      her way into others too weak for self-defence.

The hour once\n      fixed, the spirit will probably let it be known at break of dawn, or the\n      previous night, if indeed not two nights before; for scarcely has the sun\n      drunk in the first drops of dew when a most unaccustomed stir, whose\n      meaning the bee-keeper rarely will fail to grasp, is to be noticed within\n      and around the buzzing city.

Certain as it may\n      seem that the bees communicate with each other, we know not whether this\n      be done in human fashion. It is possible even that their own refrain may\n      be inaudible to them: the murmur that comes to us heavily laden with\n      perfume of honey, the ecstatic whisper of fairest summer days that the\n      bee-keeper loves so well, the festival song of labour that rises and falls\n      around the hive in the crystal of the hour, and might almost be the chant\n      of the eager flowers, hymn of their gladness and echo of their soft\n      fragrance, the voice of the white carnations, the marjoram, and the thyme.\n      They have, however, a whole gamut of sounds that we can distinguish,\n      ranging from profound delight to menace, distress, and anger; they have\n      the ode of the queen, the song of abundance, the psalms of grief, and,\n      lastly, the long and mysterious war-cries the adolescent princesses send\n      forth during the combats and massacres that precede the nuptial flight.\n      May this be a fortuitous music that fails to attain their inward silence?\n      In any event they seem not the least disturbed at the noises we make near\n      the hive; but they regard these perhaps as not of their world, and\n      possessed of no interest for them. It is possible that we on our side hear\n      only a fractional part of the sounds that the bees produce, and that they\n      have many harmonies to which our ears are not attuned. We soon shall see\n      with what startling rapidity they are able to understand each other, and\n      adopt concerted measures, when, for instance, the great honey thief, the\n      huge sphinx atropos, the sinister butterfly that bears a death's head on\n      its back, penetrates into the hive, humming its own strange note, which\n      acts as a kind of irresistible incantation; the news spreads quickly from\n      group to group, and from the guards at the threshold to the workers on the\n      furthest combs, the whole population quivers.",

Do they obey some God? I can see nothing that governs their\n      actions. The little things that one day they appear to collect and build\n      up, the next they destroy and scatter. They come and they go, they meet\n      and disperse, but one knows not what it is they seek. In numberless cases\n      the spectacle they present is altogether inexplicable. There are some, for\n      instance, who, as it were, seem scarcely to stir from their place. They\n      are to be distinguished by their glossier coat, and often too by their\n      more considerable bulk. They occupy buildings ten or twenty times larger\n      than ordinary dwellings, and richer, and more ingeniously fashioned. Every\n      day they spend many hours at their meals, which sometimes indeed are\n      prolonged far into the night. They appear to be held in extraordinary\n      honour by those who approach them; men come from the neighbouring houses,\n      bringing provisions, and even from the depths of the country, laden with\n      presents. One can only assume that these persons must be indispensable to\n      the race, to which they render essential service, although our means of\n      investigation have not yet enabled us to discover what the precise nature\n      of this service may be. There are others, again, who are incessantly\n      engaged in the most wearisome labour, whether it be in great sheds full of\n      wheels that forever turn round and round, or close by the shipping, or in\n      obscure hovels, or on small plots of earth that from sunrise to sunset\n      they are constantly delving and digging. We are led to believe that this\n      labour must be an offence, and punishable. For the persons guilty of it\n      are housed in filthy, ruinous, squalid cabins. They are clothed in some\n      colourless hide. So great does their ardour appear for this noxious, or at\n      any rate useless activity, that they scarcely allow themselves time to eat\n      or to sleep. In numbers they are to the others as a thousand to one. It is\n      remarkable that the species should have been able to survive to this day\n      under conditions so unfavourable to its development. It should be\n      mentioned, however, that apart from this characteristic devotion to their\n      wearisome toil, they appear inoffensive and docile; and satisfied with the\n      leavings of those who evidently are the guardians, if not the saviours, of\n      the race.\"",

Such\n      knowledge as we possess of the general psychology of the bee warrants the\n      belief that the swarming always takes place against the old sovereign's\n      will.

In accordance with the manner in which he deals with her -- as it\n      were, plays with her -- he can increase and hasten the swarm or\n      restrict and retard it; he can unite or divide colonies, and direct the\n      emigration of kingdoms.

He too yields only\n      to necessity, the attraction of pleasure, and the fear of suffering; and\n      what we call our intellect has the same origin and mission as what in\n      animals we choose to term instinct. We do certain things, whose results we\n      conceive to be known to us; other things happen, and we flatter ourselves\n      that we are better equipped than animals can be to divine their cause;\n      but, apart from the fact that this supposition rests on no very solid\n      foundation, events of this nature are rare and infinitesimal, compared\n      with the vast mass of others that elude comprehension; and all, the\n      pettiest and the most sublime, the best known and the most inexplicable,\n      the nearest and the most distant, come to pass in a night so profound that\n      our blindness may well be almost as great as that we suppose in the bee.",

                "\"All must agree,\" remarks Buffon, who has a somewhat amusing prejudice\n      against the bee, -- \"all must agree that these flies, individually\n      considered, possess far less genius than the dog, the monkey, or the\n      majority of animals; that they display far less docility, attachment, or\n      sentiment; that they have, in a word, less qualities that relate to our\n      own; and from that we may conclude that their apparent intelligence\n      derives only from their assembled multitude; nor does this union even\n      argue intelligence, for it is governed by no moral considerations, it\n      being without their consent that they find themselves gathered together.\n      This society, therefore, is no more than a physical assemblage ordained by\n      nature, and independent either of knowledge, or reason, or aim. The\n      mother-bee produces ten thousand individuals at a time, and in the same\n      place; these ten thousand individuals, were they a thousand times stupider\n      than I suppose them to be, would be compelled, for the mere purpose of\n      existence, to contrive some form of arrangement; and, assuming that they\n      had begun by injuring each other, they would, as each one possesses the\n      same strength as its fellow, soon have ended by doing each other the least\n      possible harm, or, in other words, by rendering assistance. They have the\n      appearance of understanding each other, and of working for a common aim;\n      and the observer, therefore, is apt to endow them with reasons and\n      intellect that they truly are far from possessing. He will pretend to\n      account for each action, show a reason behind every movement; and from\n      thence the gradation is easy to proclaiming them marvels, or monsters, of\n      innumerable ideas. Whereas the truth is that these ten thousand\n      individuals, that have been produced simultaneously, that have lived\n      together, and undergone metamorphosis at more or less the same time,\n      cannot fail all to do the same thing, and are compelled, however slight\n      the sentiment within them, to adopt common habits, to live in accord and\n      union, to busy themselves with their dwelling, to return to it after their\n      journeys, etc., etc. And on this foundation arise the architecture, the\n      geometry, the order, the foresight, love of country, -- in a word, the\n      republic; all springing, as we have seen, from the admiration of the\n      observer.\" There we have our bees explained in a very different fashion.\n      And if it seem more natural at first, is it not for the very simple reason\n      that it really explains almost nothing? I will not allude to the material\n      errors this chapter contains; I will only ask whether the mere fact of the\n      bees accepting a common existence, while doing each other the least\n      possible harm, does not in itself argue a certain intelligence. And does\n      not this intelligence appear the more remarkable to us as we more closely\n      examine the fashion in which these \"ten thousand individuals\" avoid\n      hurting each other, and end by giving assistance? And further, is this not\n      the history of ourselves; and does not all that the angry old naturalist\n      says apply equally to every one of our human societies? And yet once\n      again: if the bee is indeed to be credited with none of the feelings or\n      ideas that we have ascribed to it, shall we not very willingly shift the\n      ground of our wonder? If we must not admire the bee, we will then admire\n      nature; the moment must always come when admiration can be no longer\n      denied us, nor shall there be loss to us through our having retreated, or\n      waited.",
                "However these things may be, and without abandoning this conjecture of\n      ours, that at least has the advantage of connecting in our mind certain\n      actions that have evident connection in fact, it is certain that the bees\n      have far less adoration for the queen herself than for the infinite future\n      of the race that she represents. They are not sentimental; and should one\n      of their number return from work so severely wounded as to be held\n      incapable of further service, they will ruthlessly expel her from the\n      hive. And yet it cannot be said that they are altogether incapable of a\n      kind of personal attachment towards their mother. They will recognise her\n      from among all. Even when she is old, crippled, and wretched, the\n      sentinels at the door will never allow another queen to enter the hive,\n      though she be young and fruitful. It is true that this is one of the\n      fundamental principles of their polity, and never relaxed except at times\n      of abundant honey, in favour of some foreign worker who shall be well\n      laden with food.",
                "When the queen has become completely sterile, the bees will rear a certain\n      number of royal princesses to fill her place. But what becomes of the old\n      sovereign? As to this we have no precise knowledge; but it has happened,\n      at times, that apiarists have found a magnificent queen, in the flower of\n      her age, on the central comb of the hive; and in some obscure corner,\n      right at the back, the gaunt, decrepit \"old mistress,\" as they call her in\n      Normandy. In such cases it would seem that the bees have to exercise the\n      greatest care to protect her from the hatred of the vigorous rival who\n      longs for her death; for queen hates queen so fiercely that two who might\n      happen to be under the same roof would immediately fly at each other. It\n      would be pleasant to believe that the bees are thus providing their\n      ancient sovereign with a humble shelter in a remote corner of the city,\n      where she may end her days in peace. Here again we touch one of the\n      thousand enigmas of the waxen city; and it is once more proved to us that\n      the habits and the policy of the bees are by no means narrow, or rigidly\n      predetermined; and that their actions have motives far more complex than\n      we are inclined to suppose.",
                "{32}",
                "But we are constantly tampering with what they must regard as immovable\n      laws of nature; constantly placing the bees in a position that may be\n      compared to that in which we should ourselves be placed were the laws of\n      space and gravity, of light and heat, to be suddenly suppressed around us.\n      What are the bees to do when we, by force or by fraud, introduce a second\n      queen into the city? It is probable that, in a state of nature, thanks to\n      the sentinels at the gate, such an event has never occurred since they\n      first came into the world. But this prodigious conjuncture does not\n      scatter their wits; they still contrive to reconcile the two principles\n      that they appear to regard in the light of divine commands. The first is\n      that of unique maternity, never infringed except in the case of sterility\n      in the reigning queen, and even then only very exceptionally; the second\n      is more curious still, and, although never transgressed, susceptible of\n      what may almost be termed a Judaic evasion. It is the law that invests the\n      person of a queen, whoever she be, with a sort of inviolability. It would\n      be a simple matter for the bees to pierce the intruder with their myriad\n      envenomed stings; she would die on the spot, and they would merely have to\n      remove the corpse from the hive. But though this sting is always held\n      ready to strike, though they make constant use of it in their fights among\n      themselves, they will never draw it against a queen; nor will a\n      queen ever draw hers on a man, an animal, or an ordinary bee. She will\n      never unsheath her royal weapon -- curved, in scimeter fashion, instead\n      of being straight, like that of the ordinary bee -- save only in the\n      case of her doing battle with an equal: in other words, with a sister\n      queen.",
                "No bee, it would seem, dare take on herself the horror of direct and\n      bloody regicide. Whenever, therefore, the good order and prosperity of the\n      republic appear to demand that a queen shall die, they endeavour to give\n      to her death some semblance of natural decease, and by infinite\n      subdivision of the crime, to render it almost anonymous.",
                "They will, therefore, to use the picturesque expression of the apiarist,\n      \"ball\" the queenly intruder; in other words, they will entirely surround\n      her with their innumerable interlaced bodies. They will thus form a sort\n      of living prison wherein the captive is unable to move; and in this prison\n      they will keep her for twenty-four hours, if need be, till the victim die\n      of suffocation or hunger.",
                "But if, at this moment, the legitimate queen draw near, and, scenting a\n      rival, appear disposed to attack her, the living walls of the prison will\n      at once fly open; and the bees, forming a circle around the two enemies,\n      will eagerly watch the strange duel that will ensue, though remaining\n      strictly impartial, and taking no share in it. For it is written that\n      against a mother the sting may be drawn by a mother alone; only she who\n      bears in her flanks close on two million lives appears to possess the\n      right with one blow to inflict close on two million deaths.",
                "But if the combat last too long, without any result, if the circular\n      weapons glide harmlessly over the heavy cuirasses, if one of the queens\n      appear anxious to make her escape, then, be she the legitimate sovereign\n      or be she the stranger, she will at once be seized and lodged in the\n      living prison until such time as she manifest once more the desire to\n      attack her foe. It is right to add, however, that the numerous experiments\n      that have been made on this subject have almost invariably resulted in the\n      victory of the reigning queen, owing perhaps to the extra courage and\n      ardour she derives from the knowledge that she is at home, with her\n      subjects around her, or to the fact that the bees, however impartial while\n      the fight is in progress, may possibly display some favouritism in their\n      manner of imprisoning the rivals; for their mother would seem scarcely to\n      suffer from the confinement, whereas the stranger almost always emerges in\n      an appreciably bruised and enfeebled condition.",

Replace her, a few hours later, and all her daughters will hasten\n      towards her, offering honey. One section will form a lane, for her to pass\n      through; others, with head bent low and abdomen high in the air, will\n      describe before her great semicircles throbbing with sound; hymning,\n      doubtless, the chant of welcome their rites dictate for moments of supreme\n      happiness or solemn respect.",

The bees will at once detect the\n      imposture; the intruder will be seized, and immediately enclosed in the\n      terrible, tumultuous prison, whose obstinate walls will be relieved, as it\n      were, till she dies; for in this particular instance it hardly ever occurs\n      that the stranger emerges alive.",
                "And here it is curious to note to what diplomacy and elaborate stratagem\n      man is compelled to resort in order to delude these little sagacious\n      insects, and bend them to his will. In their unswerving loyalty, they will\n      accept the most unexpected events with touching courage, regarding them\n      probably as some new and inevitable fatal caprice of nature. And, indeed,\n      all this diplomacy notwithstanding, in the desperate confusion that may\n      follow one of these hazardous expedients, it is on the admirable good\n      sense of the bee that man always, and almost empirically, relies; on the\n      inexhaustible treasure of their marvellous laws and customs, on their love\n      of peace and order, their devotion to the public weal, and fidelity to the\n      future; on the adroit strength, the earnest disinterestedness, of their\n      character, and, above all, on the untiring devotion with which they fulfil\n      their duty. But the enumeration of such procedures belongs rather to\n      technical treatises on apiculture, and would take us too far.*",
                "*The stranger queen is usually brought into the hive\n     enclosed in a little cage, with iron wires, which is hung\n     between two combs. The cage has a door made of wax and\n     honey, which the workers, their anger over, proceed to gnaw,\n     thus freeing the prisoner, whom they will often receive\n     without any ill-will. Mr. Simmins, manager of the great\n     apiary at Rottingdean, has recently discovered another\n     method of introducing a queen, which, being extremely simple\n     and almost invariably successful, bids fair to be generally\n     adopted by apiarists who value their art. It is the\n     behaviour of the queen that usually makes her introduction a\n     matter of so great difficulty. She is almost distracted,\n     flies to and fro, hides, and generally comports herself as\n     an intruder, thus arousing the suspicions of the bees, which\n     are soon confirmed by the workers' examination. Mr. Simmins\n     at first completely isolates the queen he intends to\n     introduce, and lets her fast for half an hour. He then lifts\n     a corner of the inner cover of the orphaned hive, and places\n     the strange queen on the top of one of the combs. Her former\n     isolation having terrified her, she is delighted to find\n     herself in the midst of the bees; and being famished she\n     eagerly accepts the food they offer her. The workers,\n     deceived by her assurance, do not examine her, but probably\n     imagine that their old queen has returned, and welcome her\n     joyfully. It would seem, therefore, that, contrary to the\n     opinion of Huber and all other investigators, the bees are\n     not capable of recognising their queen. In any event, the\n     two explanations, which are both equally plausible -- though\n     the truth may lurk, perhaps, in a third, that is not yet\n     known to us -- only prove once again how complex and obscure\n     is the psychology of the bee. And from this, as from all\n     questions that deal with life, we can draw one conclusion\n     only: that, till better obtain, curiosity still must rule in\n     our heart.",
                "{34}",
                "As regards this personal affection of which we have spoken, there is one\n      word more to be said. That such affection exists is certain, but it is\n      certain also that its memory is exceedingly short-lived. Dare to replace\n      in her kingdom a mother whose exile has lasted some days, and her\n      indignant daughters will receive her in such a fashion as to compel you\n      hastily to snatch her from the deadly imprisonment reserved for unknown\n      queens. For the bees have had time to transform a dozen workers'\n      habitations into royal cells, and the future of the race is no longer in\n      danger. Their affection will increase, or dwindle, in the degree that the\n      queen represents the future. Thus we often find, when a virgin queen is\n      performing the perilous ceremony known as the \"nuptial flight,\" of which I\n      will speak later, that her subjects are so fearful of losing her that they\n      will all accompany her on this tragic and distant quest of love. This they\n      will never do, however, if they be provided with a fragment of comb\n      containing brood-cells, whence they shall be able to rear other queens.\n      Indeed, their affection even may turn into fury and hatred should their\n      sovereign fail in her duty to that sort of abstract divinity that we\n      should call future society, which the bees would appear to regard far more\n      seriously than we. It happens, for instance, at times, that apiarists for\n      various reasons will prevent the queen from joining a swarm by inserting a\n      trellis into the hive; the nimble and slender workers will flit through\n      it, unperceiving, but to the poor slave of love, heavier and more\n      corpulent than her daughters, it offers an impassable barrier. The bees,\n      when they find that the queen has not followed, will return to the hive,\n      and scold the unfortunate prisoner, hustle and ill-treat her, accusing her\n      of laziness, probably, or suspecting her of feeble mind. On their second\n      departure, when they find that she still has not followed, her ill-faith\n      becomes evident to them, and their attacks grow more serious. And finally,\n      when they shall have gone forth once more, and still with the same result,\n      they will almost always condemn her, as being irremediably faithless to\n      her destiny and to the future of the race, and put her to death in the\n      royal prison.",
                "{35}",
                "It is to the future, therefore, that the bees subordinate all things; and\n      with a foresight, a harmonious co-operation, a skill in interpreting\n      events and turning them to the best advantage, that must compel our\n      heartiest admiration, particularly when we remember in how startling and\n      supernatural a light our recent intervention must present itself to them.\n      It may be said, perhaps, that in the last instance we have given, they\n      place a very false construction upon the queen's inability to follow them.\n      But would our powers of discernment be so very much subtler, if an\n      intelligence of an order entirely different from our own, and served by a\n      body so colossal that its movements were almost as imperceptible as those\n      of a natural phenomenon, were to divert itself by laying traps of this\n      kind for us? Has it not taken us thousands of years to invent a\n      sufficiently plausible explanation for the thunderbolt? There is a certain\n      feebleness that overwhelms every intellect the moment it emerges from its\n      own sphere, and is brought face to face with events not of its own\n      initiation. And, besides, it is quite possible that if this ordeal of the\n      trellis were to obtain more regularly and generally among the bees, they\n      would end by detecting the pitfall, and by taking steps to elude it. They\n      have mastered the intricacies of the movable comb, of the sections that\n      compel them to store their surplus honey in little boxes symmetrically\n      piled; and in the case of the still more extraordinary innovation of\n      foundation wax, where the cells are indicated only by a slender\n      circumference of wax, they are able at once to grasp the advantages this\n      new system presents; they most carefully extend the wax, and thus, without\n      loss of time or labour, construct perfect cells. So long as the event that\n      confronts them appear not a snare devised by some cunning and malicious\n      god, the bees may be trusted always to discover the best, nay, the only\n      human, solution. Let me cite an instance; an event, that, though occurring\n      in nature, is still in itself wholly abnormal. I refer to the manner in\n      which the bees will dispose of a mouse or a slug that may happen to have\n      found its way into the hive. The intruder killed, they have to deal with\n      the body, which will very soon poison their dwelling. If it be impossible\n      for them to expel or dismember it, they will proceed methodically and\n      hermetically to enclose it in a veritable sepulchre of propolis and wax,\n      which will tower fantastically above the ordinary monuments of the city.\n      In one of my hives last year I discovered three such tombs side by side,\n      erected with party-walls, like the cells of the comb, so that no wax\n      should be wasted. These tombs the prudent grave-diggers had raised over\n      the remains of three snails that a child had introduced into the hive. As\n      a rule, when dealing with snails, they will be content to seal up with wax\n      the orifice of the shell. But in this case the shells were more or less\n      cracked and broken; and they had considered it simpler, therefore, to bury\n      the entire snail; and had further contrived, in order that circulation in\n      the entrance-hall might not be impeded, a number of galleries exactly\n      proportionate, not to their own girth, but to that of the males, which are\n      almost twice as large as themselves. Does not this instance, and the one\n      that follows, warrant our believing that they would in time discover the\n      cause of the queen's inability to follow them through the trellis? They\n      have a very nice sense of proportion, and of the space required for the\n      movement of bodies. In the regions where the hideous death's-head sphinx,\n      the acherontia atropos, abounds, they construct little pillars of wax at\n      the entrance of the hive, so restricting the dimension as to prevent the\n      passage of the nocturnal marauder's enormous abdomen.",
                "{36}",
                "But enough on this point; were I to cite every instance I should never\n      have done. To return to the queen, whose position in the hive, and the\n      part that she plays therein, we shall most fitly describe by declaring her\n      to be the captive heart of the city, and the centre around which its\n      intelligence revolves. Unique sovereign though she be, she is also the\n      royal servant, the responsible delegate of love, and its captive\n      custodian. Her people serve her and venerate her; but they never forget\n      that it is not to her person that their homage is given, but to the\n      mission that she fulfils, and the destiny she represents. It would not be\n      easy for us to find a human republic whose scheme comprised more of the\n      desires of our planet; or a democracy that offered an independence more\n      perfect and rational, combined with a submission more logical and more\n      complete. And nowhere, surely, should we discover more painful and\n      absolute sacrifice. Let it not be imagined that I admire this sacrifice to\n      the extent that I admire its results. It were evidently to be desired that\n      these results might be obtained at the cost of less renouncement and\n      suffering. But, the principle once accepted, -- and this is needful,\n      perhaps, in the scheme of our globe, -- its organisation compels our\n      wonder. Whatever the human truth on this point may be, life, in the hive,\n      is not looked on as a series of more or less pleasant hours, whereof it is\n      wise that those moments only should be soured and embittered that are\n      essential for maintaining existence. The bees regard it as a great common\n      duty, impartially distributed amongst them all, and tending towards a\n      future that goes further and further back ever since the world began. And,\n      for the sake of this future, each one renounces more than half of her\n      rights and her joys. The queen bids farewell to freedom, the light of day,\n      and the calyx of flowers; the workers give five or six years of their\n      life, and shall never know love, or the joys of maternity. The queen's\n      brain turns to pulp, that the reproductive organs may profit; in the\n      workers these organs atrophy, to the benefit of their intelligence. Nor\n      would it be fair to allege that the will plays no part in all these\n      renouncements. We have seen that each worker's larva can be transformed\n      into a queen if lodged and fed on the royal plan; and similarly could each\n      royal larva be turned into worker if her food were changed and her cell\n      reduced. These mysterious elections take place every day in the golden\n      shade of the hive. It is not chance that controls them, but a wisdom whose\n      deep loyalty, gravity, and unsleeping watchfulness man alone can betray: a\n      wisdom that makes and unmakes, and keeps careful watch over all that\n      happens within and without the city. If sudden flowers abound, or the\n      queen grow old, or less fruitful; if population increase, and be pressed\n      for room, you then shall find that the bees will proceed to rear royal\n      cells. But these cells may be destroyed if the harvest fail, or the hive\n      be enlarged. Often they will be retained so long as the young queen have\n      not accomplished, or succeeded in, her marriage flight, -- to be at\n      once annihilated when she returns, trailing behind her, trophy-wise, the\n      infallible sign of her impregnation. Who shall say where the wisdom\n      resides that can thus balance present and future, and prefer what is not\n      yet visible to that which already is seen? Where the anonymous prudence\n      that selects and abandons, raises and lowers; that of so many workers\n      makes so many queens, and of so many mothers can make a people of virgins?\n      We have said elsewhere that it lodged in the \"Spirit of the Hive,\" but\n      where shall this spirit of the hive be looked for if not in the assembly\n      of workers? To be convinced of its residence there, we need not perhaps\n      have studied so closely the habits of this royal republic. It was enough\n      to place under the microscope, as Dujardin, Brandt, Girard, Vogel, and\n      other entomologists have done, the little uncouth and careworn head of the\n      virgin worker side by side with the somewhat empty skull of the queen and\n      the male's magnificent cranium, glistening with its twenty-six thousand\n      eyes. Within this tiny head we should find the workings of the vastest and\n      most magnificent brain of the hive: the most beautiful and complex, the\n      most perfect, that, in another order and with a different organisation, is\n      to be found in nature after that of man. Here again, as in every quarter\n      where the scheme of the world is known to us, there where the brain is,\n      are authority and victory, veritable strength and wisdom. And here again\n      it is an almost invisible atom of this mysterious substance that organises\n      and subjugates matter, and is able to create its own little triumphant and\n      permanent place in the midst of the stupendous, inert forces of\n      nothingness and death.*",

On the other hand\n     the peduncular parts, whose development usually keeps pace\n     with the triumphs the intellect achieves over instinct, are\n     somewhat less important in the bee than in the ant. It would\n     seem to result from these estimates -- which are of course\n     hypothetical, and deal with a matter that is exceedingly\n     obscure -- that the intellectual value of the bee and the ant\n     must be more or less equal.",

At the moment this signal is given, it is as though one\n      sudden mad impulse had simultaneously flung open wide every single gate in\n      the city; and the black throng issues, or rather pours forth in a double,\n      or treble, or quadruple jet, as the number of exits may be; in a tense,\n      direct, vibrating, uninterrupted stream that at once dissolves and melts\n      into space, where the myriad transparent, furious wings weave a tissue\n      throbbing with sound. And this for some moments will quiver right over the\n      hive, with prodigious rustle of gossamer silks that countless electrified\n      hands might be ceaselessly rending and stitching; it floats undulating, it\n      trembles and flutters like a veil of gladness invisible fingers support in\n      the sky, and wave to and fro, from the flowers to the blue, expecting\n      sublime advent or departure. And at last one angle declines another is\n      lifted; the radiant mantle unites its four sunlit corners; and like the\n      wonderful carpet the fairy-tale speaks of, that flits across space to obey\n      its master's command, it steers its straight course, bending forward a\n      little as though to hide in its folds the sacred presence of the future,\n      towards the willow, the pear-tree, or lime whereon the queen has alighted;\n      and round her each rhythmical wave comes to rest, as though on a nail of\n      gold, and suspends its fabric of pearls and of luminous wings.",
                "And then there is silence once more; and, in an instant, this mighty\n      tumult, this awful curtain apparently laden with unspeakable menace and\n      anger, this bewildering golden hail that streamed upon every object near -- all\n      these become merely a great, inoffensive, peaceful cluster of bees,\n      composed of thousands of little motionless groups, that patiently wait, as\n      they hang from the branch of a tree, for the scouts to return who have\n      gone in search of a place of shelter.",

They will settle as a rule on\n      the shrub or the tree that is nearest the hive; for the queen, besides\n      being weighed down by her eggs, has dwelt in constant darkness ever since\n      her marriage-flight, or the swarm of the previous year; and is naturally\n      reluctant to venture far into space, having indeed almost forgotten the\n      use of her wings.",

Into\n      this hive the cluster will fall as heavily as an over-ripe fruit. Or, if\n      the branch be too stout, he can plunge a spoon into the mass; and deposit\n      where he will the living spoonfuls, as though he were ladling out corn. He\n      need have no fear of the bees that are buzzing around him, settling on his\n      face and hands. The air resounds with their song of ecstasy, which is\n      different far from their chant of anger. He need have no fear that the\n      swarm will divide, or grow fierce, will scatter, or try to escape. This is\n      a day, I repeat, when a spirit of holiday would seem to animate these\n      mysterious workers, a spirit of confidence, that apparently nothing can\n      trouble. They have detached themselves from the wealth they had to defend,\n      and they no longer recognise their enemies. They become inoffensive\n      because of their happiness, though why they are happy we know not, except\n      it be because they are obeying their law. A moment of such blind happiness\n      is accorded by nature at times to every living thing, when she seeks to\n      accomplish her end. Nor need we feel any surprise that here the bees are\n      her dupes; we ourselves, who have studied her movements these centuries\n      past, and with a brain more perfect than that of the bee, we too are her\n      dupes, and know not even yet whether she be benevolent or indifferent, or\n      only basely cruel.",

And then the strange home will at once be accepted, and its\n      remotest corners explored; its position in the apiary, its form, its\n      colour, are grasped and retained in these thousands of prudent and\n      faithful little memories. Careful note is taken of the neighbouring\n      landmarks, the new city is founded, and its place established in the mind\n      and the heart of all its inhabitants; the walls resound with the love-hymn\n      of the royal presence, and work begins.",

They return one by one, and render account of their mission; and\n      as it is manifestly impossible for us to fathom the thought of the bees,\n      we can only interpret in human fashion the spectacle that they present. We\n      may regard it as probable, therefore, that most careful attention is given\n      to the reports of the various scouts. One of them it may be, dwells on the\n      advantage of some hollow tree it has seen; another is in favour of a\n      crevice in a ruinous wall, of a cavity in a grotto, or an abandoned\n      burrow. The assembly often will pause and deliberate until the following\n      morning. Then at last the choice is made, and approved by all. At a given\n      moment the entire mass stirs, disunites, sets in motion, and then, in one\n      sustained and impetuous flight, that this time knows no obstacle, it will\n      steer its straight course, over hedges and cornfields, over haystack and\n      lake, over river and village, to its determined and always distant goal.\n      It is rarely indeed that this second stage can be followed by man.

They have forgotten the\n      splendour and wealth of their native city, where existence had been so\n      admirably organised and certain, where the essence of every flower\n      reminiscent of sunshine had enabled them to smile at the menace of winter.\n      There, asleep in the depths of their cradles, they have left thousands and\n      thousands of daughters, whom they never again will see. They have\n      abandoned, not only the enormous treasure of pollen and propolis they had\n      gathered together, but also more than 120 pounds of honey; a quantity\n      representing more than twelve times the entire weight of the population,\n      and close on 600,000 times that of the individual bee. To man this would\n      mean 42,000 tons of provisions, a vast fleet of mighty ships laden with\n      nourishment more precious than any known to us; for to the bee honey is a\n      kind of liquid life, a species of chyle that is at once assimilated, with\n      almost no waste whatever.",

There is only\n      the dreary emptiness of an enormous monument that has nothing but sides\n      and roof. Within the smooth and rounded walls there only is darkness; and\n      the enormous arch above rears itself over nothingness. But useless regrets\n      are unknown to the bee; or in any event it does not allow them to hinder\n      its action. Far from being cast down by an ordeal before which every other\n      courage would succumb, it displays greater ardour than ever. Scarcely has\n      the hive been set in its place, or the disorder allayed that ensued on the\n      bees' tumultuous fall, when we behold the clearest, most unexpected\n      division in that entangled mass. The greater portion, forming in solid\n      columns, like an army obeying a definite order, will proceed to climb the\n      vertical walls of the hive. The cupola reached, the first to arrive will\n      cling with the claws of their anterior legs, those that follow hang on to\n      the first, and so in succession, until long chains have been formed that\n      serve as a bridge to the crowd that rises and rises. And, by slow degrees,\n      these chains, as their number increases, supporting each other and\n      incessantly interweaving, become garlands which, in their turn, the\n      uninterrupted and constant ascension transforms into a thick, triangular\n      curtain, or rather a kind of compact and inverted cone, whose apex attains\n      the summit of the cupola, while its widening base descends to a half, or\n      two-thirds, of the entire height of the hive. And then, the last bee that\n      an inward voice has impelled to form part of this group having added\n      itself to the curtain suspended in darkness, the ascension ceases; all\n      movement slowly dies away in the dome; and, for long hours, this strange\n      inverted cone will wait, in a silence that almost seems awful, in a\n      stillness one might regard as religious, for the mystery of wax to appear.",

They are\n      satisfied to examine the edifice and undertake the necessary labours. They\n      carefully sweep the floor, and remove, one by one, twigs, grains of sand,\n      and dead leaves; for the bees are almost fanatically cleanly, and when, in\n      the depths of winter, severe frosts retard too long what apiarists term\n      their \"flight of cleanliness,\" rather than sully the hive they will perish\n      by thousands of a terrible bowel-disease.

And there the little insect is\n      expected to learn its bearings, to find its way, to establish its home; to\n      modify the seemingly unchangeable plans dictated by the nature of things.\n      In this unfamiliar place it is required to determine the site of the\n      winter storehouses, that must not extend beyond the zone of heat that\n      issues from the half-numbed inhabitants; it must divine the exact point\n      where the brood-cells shall concentrate, under penalty of disaster should\n      these be too high or too low, too near to or far from the door. The swarm,\n      it may be, has just left the trunk of a fallen tree, containing one long,\n      narrow, depressed, horizontal gallery; and it finds itself now in a\n      tower-shaped edifice, whose roof is lost in gloom. Or, to take a case that\n      is more usual, perhaps, and one that will give some idea of the surprise\n      habitually in store for the bees: after having lived for centuries past\n      beneath the straw dome of our village hives, they are suddenly\n      transplanted to a species of mighty cupboard, or chest, three or four\n      times as large as the place of their birth; and installed in the midst of\n      a confused scaffolding of superposed frames, some running parallel to the\n      entrance and some perpendicular; the whole forming a bewildering network\n      that obscures the surfaces of their dwelling.",

The swarm will simply forsake the\n      inhospitable abode, to seek better fortune some little distance away. And\n      similarly it can never be said of them that they can be induced to\n      undertake any illogical or foolish task. Their common-sense has never been\n      known to fail them; they have never, at a loss for definite decision,\n      erected at haphazard structures of a wild or heterogeneous nature. Though\n      you place the swarm in a sphere, a cube, or a pyramid, in an oval or\n      polygonal basket, you will find, on visiting the bees a few days later,\n      that if this strange assembly of little independent intellects has\n      accepted the new abode, they will at once, and unhesitatingly and\n      unanimously have known how to select the most favourable, often humanly\n      speaking the only possible spot in this absurd habitation, in pursuance of\n      a method whose principles may appear inflexible, but whose results are\n      strikingly vivid.",

But if the apiarist have taken the precaution of\n      surrounding the upper lath of some of these frames with a narrow fillet of\n      wax, they will be quick to perceive the advantage this tempting offer\n      presents, and will carefully extract the fillet, using their own wax as\n      solder, and will prolong the comb in accordance with the indicated plan.\n      Similarly -- and the case is frequent in modern apiculture -- if all\n      the frames of the hive into which the bees have been gathered be covered\n      from top to bottom with leaves of foundation-wax, they will not waste time\n      in erecting buildings across or beside these, or in producing useless wax,\n      but, finding that the work is already half finished, they will be\n      satisfied to deepen and lengthen each of the cells designed in the leaf,\n      carefully rectifying these where there is the slightest deviation from the\n      strictest vertical. Proceeding in this fashion, therefore, they will\n      possess in a week a city as luxurious and well-constructed as the one they\n      have quitted; whereas, had they been thrown on their own resources, it\n      would have taken them two or three months to construct so great a\n      profusion of dwellings and storehouses of shining wax.",

                "This power of appropriation may well be considered to overstep the limit\n      of instinct; and indeed there can be nothing more arbitrary than the\n      distinction we draw between instinct and intelligence properly so-called.\n      Sir John Lubbock, whose observations on ants, bees, and wasps are so\n      interesting and so personal, is reluctant to credit the bee, from the\n      moment it forsakes the routine of its habitual labour, with any power of\n      discernment or reasoning. This attitude of his may be due in some measure\n      to an unconscious bias in favour of the ants, whose ways he has more\n      specially noted; for the entomologist is always inclined to regard that\n      insect as the more intelligent to which he has more particularly devoted\n      himself, and we have to be on our guard against this little personal\n      predilection. As a proof of his theory, Sir John cites as an instance an\n      experiment within the reach of all. If you place in a bottle half a dozen\n      bees and the same number of flies, and lay the bottle down horizontally,\n      with its base to the window, you will find that the bees will persist,\n      till they die of exhaustion or hunger, in their endeavour to discover an\n      issue through the glass; while the flies, in less than two minutes, will\n      all have sallied forth through the neck on the opposite side. From this\n      Sir John Lubbock concludes that the intelligence of the bee is exceedingly\n      limited, and that the fly shows far greater skill in extricating itself\n      from a difficulty, and finding its way. This conclusion, however, would\n      not seem altogether flawless. Turn the transparent sphere twenty times, if\n      you will, holding now the base, now the neck, to the window, and you will\n      find that the bees will turn twenty times with it, so as always to face\n      the light. It is their love of the light, it is their very intelligence,\n      that is their undoing in this experiment of the English savant. They\n      evidently imagine that the issue from every prison must be there where the\n      light shines clearest; and they act in accordance, and persist in too\n      logical action. To them glass is a supernatural mystery they never have\n      met with in nature; they have had no experience of this suddenly\n      impenetrable atmosphere; and, the greater their intelligence, the more\n      inadmissible, more incomprehensible, will the strange obstacle appear.\n      Whereas the featherbrained flies, careless of logic as of the enigma of\n      crystal, disregarding the call of the light, flutter wildly hither and\n      thither, and, meeting here the good fortune that often waits on the\n      simple, who find salvation there where the wiser will perish, necessarily\n      end by discovering the friendly opening that restores their liberty to\n      them.",
                "The same naturalist cites yet another proof of the bees' lack of\n      intelligence, and discovers it in the following quotation from the great\n      American apiarist, the venerable and paternal Langstroth: --",
                "\"As the fly was not intended to banquet on blossoms, but on substances in\n      which it might easily be drowned, it cautiously alights on the edge of any\n      vessel containing liquid food, and warily helps itself; while the poor\n      bee, plunging in headlong, speedily perishes. The sad fate of their\n      unfortunate companions does not in the least deter others who approach the\n      tempting lure from madly alighting on the bodies of the dying and the\n      dead, to share the same miserable end. No one can understand the extent of\n      their infatuation until he has seen a confectioner's shop assailed by\n      myriads of hungry bees. I have seen thousands strained out from the syrups\n      in which they had perished; thousands more alighting even on the boiling\n      sweets; the floors covered and windows darkened with bees, some crawling,\n      others flying, and others still so completely besmeared as to be able\n      neither to crawl nor to fly -- not one in ten able to carry home its\n      ill-gotten spoils, and yet the air filled with new hosts of thoughtless\n      comers.\"",
                "This, however, seems to me no more conclusive than might be the spectacle\n      of a battlefield, or of the ravages of alcoholism, to a superhuman\n      observer bent on establishing the limits of human understanding. Indeed,\n      less so, perhaps; for the situation of the bee, when compared with our\n      own, is strange in this world. It was intended to live in the midst of an\n      indifferent and unconscious nature, and not by the side of an\n      extraordinary being who is forever disturbing the most constant laws, and\n      producing grandiose, inexplicable phenomena. In the natural order of\n      things, in the monotonous life of the forest, the madness Langstroth\n      describes would be possible only were some accident suddenly to destroy a\n      hive full of honey. But in this case, even, there would be no fatal glass,\n      no boiling sugar or cloying syrup; no death or danger, therefore, other\n      than that to which every animal is exposed while seeking its prey.",
                "Should we be more successful than they in preserving our presence of mind\n      if some strange power were at every step to ensnare our reason?

None\n      such being known at present, we conclude that we stand on the topmost\n      pinnacle of life on this earth; but this belief, after all, is by no means\n      infallible. I am not assuming that when our actions are unreasonable, or\n      contemptible, we merely fall into the snares that such a creature has\n      laid; though it is not inconceivable that this should one day be proved\n      true. On the other hand, it cannot be wise to deny intelligence to the bee\n      because it has not yet succeeded in distinguishing us from the great ape\n      or the bear. It is certain that there are, in us and about us, influences\n      and powers no less dissimilar whose distinction escapes us as readily.",

For thus it is ever in\n      the uncertain domain of the intellect, apparently the most vacillating and\n      precarious condition of matter. The same light that falls on the intellect\n      falls also on passion, whereof none can tell whether it be the smoke of\n      the flame or the wick. In the case above it has not been mere animal\n      desire to gorge themselves with honey that has urged on the bees. They\n      could do this at their leisure in the store-rooms at home. Watch them in\n      an analogous circumstance; follow them; you will see that, as soon as\n      their sac is filled, they will return to the hive and add their spoil to\n      the general store; and visit the marvellous vintage, and leave it, perhaps\n      thirty times in an hour. Their admirable labours, therefore, are inspired\n      by a single desire: zeal to bring as much wealth as they can to the home\n      of their sisters, which is also the home of the future. When we discover a\n      cause as disinterested for the follies of men, we are apt to call them by\n      another name.",

                "However, the whole truth must be told. In the midst of the marvels of\n      their industry, their policy, their sacrifice, one thing exists that must\n      always check and weaken our admiration; and this is the indifference with\n      which they regard the misfortunes or death of their comrades. There is a\n      strange duality in the character of the bee. In the heart of the hive all\n      help and love each other. They are as united as the good thoughts that\n      dwell in the same soul. Wound one of them, and a thousand will sacrifice\n      themselves to avenge its injury. But outside the hive they no longer\n      recognise each other. Mutilate them, crush them, -- or rather, do\n      nothing of the kind; it would be a useless cruelty, for the fact is\n      established beyond any doubt, -- but were you to mutilate, or crush, on\n      a piece of comb placed a few steps from their dwelling, twenty or thirty\n      bees that have all issued from the same hive, those you have left\n      untouched will not even turn their heads. With their tongue, fantastic as\n      a Chinese weapon, they will tranquilly continue to absorb the liquid they\n      hold more precious than life, heedless of the agony whose last gestures\n      almost are touching them, of the cries of distress that arise all around.\n      And when the comb is empty, so great is their anxiety that nothing shall\n      be lost, that their eagerness to gather the honey which clings to the\n      victims will induce them tranquilly to climb over dead and dying, unmoved\n      by the presence of the first and never dreaming of helping the others. In\n      this case, therefore, they have no notion of the danger they run, seeing\n      that they are wholly untroubled by the death that is scattered about them,\n      and they have not the slightest sense of solidarity or pity. As regards\n      the danger, the explanation lies ready to hand; the bees know not the\n      meaning of fear, and, with the exception only of smoke, are afraid of\n      nothing in the world. Outside the hive, they display extreme condescension\n      and forbearance. They will avoid whatever disturbs them, and affect to\n      ignore its existence, so long as it come not too close; as though aware\n      that this universe belongs to all, that each one has his place there, and\n      must needs be discreet and peaceful. But beneath this indulgence is\n      quietly hidden a heart so sure of itself that it never dreams of\n      protesting. If they are threatened, they will alter their course, but\n      never attempt to escape. In the hive, however, they will not confine\n      themselves to this passive ignoring of peril. They will spring with\n      incredible fury on any living thing, ant or lion or man, that dares to\n      profane the sacred ark. This we may term anger, ridiculous obstinacy, or\n      heroism, according as our mind be disposed.",
                "But of their want of solidarity outside the hive, and even of sympathy\n      within it, I can find nothing to say. Are we to believe that each form of\n      intellect possesses its own strange limitation, and that the tiny flame\n      which with so much difficulty at last burns its way through inert matter\n      and issues forth from the brain, is still so uncertain that if it illumine\n      one point more strongly the others are forced into blacker darkness? Here\n      we find that the bees (or nature acting within them) have organised work\n      in common, the love and cult of the future, in a manner more perfect than\n      can elsewhere be discovered. Is it for this reason that they have lost\n      sight of all the rest? They give their love to what lies ahead of them; we\n      bestow ours on what is around. And we who love here, perhaps, have no love\n      left for what is beyond. Nothing varies so much as the direction of pity\n      or charity. We ourselves should formerly have been far less shocked than\n      we are to-day at the insensibility of the bees; and to many an ancient\n      people such conduct would not have seemed blameworthy. And further, can we\n      tell how many of the things that we do would shock a being who might be\n      watching us as we watch the bees?"

There can be no doubting that they understand each\n      other; and indeed it were surely impossible for a republic so\n      considerable, wherein the labours are so varied and so marvellously\n      combined, to subsist amid the silence and spiritual isolation of so many\n      thousand creatures. They must be able, therefore, to give expression to\n      thoughts and feelings, by means either of a phonetic vocabulary or more\n      probably of some kind of tactile language or magnetic intuition,\n      corresponding perhaps to senses and properties of matter wholly unknown to\n      ourselves. And such intuition well might lodge in the mysterious antennae -- containing,\n      in the case of the workers, according to Cheshire's calculation, twelve\n      thousand tactile hairs and five thousand \"smell-hollows,\" wherewith they\n      probe and fathom the darkness. For the mutual understanding of the bees is\n      not confined to their habitual labours; the extraordinary also has a name\n      and place in their language; as is proved by the manner in which news,\n      good or bad, normal or supernatural, will at once spread in the hive; the\n      loss or return of the mother, for instance, the entrance of an enemy, the\n      intrusion of a strange queen, the approach of a band of marauders, the\n      discovery of treasure, etc. And so characteristic is their attitude, so\n      essentially different their murmur at each of these special events, that\n      the experienced apiarist can without difficulty tell what is troubling the\n      crowd that moves distractedly to and fro in the shadow.",
                "If you desire a more definite proof, you have but to watch a bee that\n      shall just have discovered a few drops of honey on your window-sill or the\n      corner of your table. She will immediately gorge herself with it; and so\n      eagerly, that you will have time, without fear of disturbing her, to mark\n      her tiny belt with a touch of paint. But this gluttony of hers is all on\n      the surface; the honey will not pass into the stomach proper, into what we\n      might call her personal stomach, but remains in the sac, the first\n      stomach, -- that of the community, if one may so express it. This\n      reservoir full, the bee will depart, but not with the free and thoughtless\n      motion of the fly or butterfly; she, on the contrary, will for some\n      moments fly backwards, hovering eagerly about the table or window, with\n      her head turned toward the room.",

Thereupon she will go to the hive, disgorge her plunder into one\n      of the provision-cells, and in three or four minutes return, and resume\n      operations at the providential window. And thus, while the honey lasts,\n      will she come and go, at intervals of every five minutes, till evening, if\n      need be; without interruption or rest; pursuing her regular journeys from\n      the hive to the window, from the window back to the hive.",

For studies of this description to\n      possess any interest, it is essential that they should remain absolutely\n      sincere. Had the conclusion been forced upon me that bees are incapable of\n      communicating to each other news of an event occurring outside the hive, I\n      should, I imagine, as a set-off against the slight disappointment this\n      discovery would have entailed, have derived some degree of satisfaction in\n      recognising once more that man, after all, is the only truly intelligent\n      being who inhabits our globe. And there comes too a period of life when we\n      have more joy in saying the thing that is true than in saying the thing\n      that merely is wonderful. Here as in every case the principle holds that,\n      should the naked truth appear at the moment less interesting, less great\n      and noble than the imaginary embellishment it lies in our power to bestow,\n      the fault must rest with ourselves who still are unable to perceive the\n      astonishing relation in which this truth always must stand to our being,\n      and to universal law; and in that case it is not the truth, but our\n      intellect, that needs embellishment and ennoblement.",
                "I will frankly confess, therefore, that the marked bee often returns\n      alone. Shall we believe that in bees there exists the same difference of\n      character as in men; that of them too some are gossips, and others prone\n      to silence? A friend who stood by and watched my experiment, declared that\n      it was evidently mere selfishness or vanity that caused so many of the\n      bees to refrain from revealing the source of their wealth, and from\n      sharing with others the glory of an achievement that must seem miraculous\n      to the hive. These were sad vices indeed, which give not forth the sweet\n      odour, so fragrant and loyal, that springs from the home of the many\n      thousand sisters. But, whatever the cause, it often will also happen that\n      the bee whom fortune has favoured will return to the honey accompanied by\n      two or three friends. I am aware that Sir John Lubbock, in the appendix to\n      his book on \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps,\" records the results of his\n      investigations in long and minute tables; and from these we are led to\n      infer that it is a matter of rarest occurrence for a single bee to follow\n      the one who has made the discovery. The learned naturalist does not name\n      the race of bees which he selected for his experiments, or tell us whether\n      the conditions were especially unfavourable. As for myself I only can say\n      that my own tables, compiled with great care, -- and every possible\n      precaution having been taken that the bees should not be directly\n      attracted by the odour of the honey, -- establish that on an average\n      one bee will bring others four times out of ten.",
                "I even one day came across an extraordinary little Italian bee, whose belt\n      I had marked with a touch of blue paint. In her second trip she brought\n      two of her sisters, whom I imprisoned, without interfering with her. She\n      departed once more, and this time returned with three friends, whom I\n      again confined, and so till the end of the afternoon, when, counting my\n      prisoners, I found that she had told the news to no less than eighteen\n      bees.",
                "In fact you will find, if you make this experiment yourself, that\n      communication, if not general, at least is frequent. The possession of\n      this faculty is so well known to American bee-hunters that they trade upon\n      it when engaged in searching for nests. Mr. Josiah Emery remarks on this\n      head (quoted by Romanes in his \"Intellect of Animals\"): \"Going to a field\n      or wood at a distance from tame bees with their box of honey, they gather\n      up from the flowers and imprison one or more bees, and after they have\n      become sufficiently gorged, let them out to return to their home with\n      their easily gotten load. Waiting patiently a longer or shorter time,\n      according to the distance of the bee-tree, the hunter scarcely ever fails\n      to see the bee or bees return accompanied by other bees, which are in like\n      manner imprisoned till they in turn are filled; then one or more are let\n      out at places distant from each other, and the direction in which the bee\n      flies noted; and thus, by a kind of triangulation, the position of the\n      bee-tree proximately ascertained.\"",

                "You will notice too in your experiments that the friends who appear to\n      obey the behests of good fortune do not always fly together, and that\n      there will often be an interval of several seconds between the different\n      arrivals. As regards these communications, therefore, we must ask\n      ourselves the question that Sir John Lubbock has solved as far as the ants\n      are concerned.",
                "Do the comrades who flock to the treasure only follow the bee that first\n      made the discovery, or have they been sent on by her, and do they find it\n      through following her indications, her description of the place where it\n      lies? Between these two hypotheses, that refer directly to the extent and\n      working of the bee's intellect, there is obviously an enormous difference.\n      The English savant has succeeded, by means of an elaborate and ingenious\n      arrangement of gangways, corridors, moats full of water, and flying\n      bridges, in establishing that the ants in such cases do no more than\n      follow in the track of the pioneering insect. With ants, that can be made\n      to pass where one will, such experiments are possible; but for the bee,\n      whose wings throw every avenue open, some other expedient must of\n      necessity be contrived. I imagined the following, which, though it gave no\n      definite result, might yet, under more favourable conditions, and if\n      organised more carefully, give rise to definite and satisfactory\n      conclusions.",
                "My study in the country is on the first floor, above a somewhat lofty\n      room; sufficiently high, therefore, to be out of the ordinary range of the\n      bees' flight, except at times when the chestnuts and lime trees are in\n      bloom. And for more than a week before I started this experiment I had\n      kept on my table an open comb of honey, without the perfume having\n      attracted, or induced the visit of, a single bee. Then I went to a glass\n      hive that was close to the house, took an Italian bee, brought her to my\n      study, set her on the comb, and marked her while she was feeding.",
                "When satisfied, she flew away and returned to the hive. I followed, saw\n      her pass over the surface of the crowd, plunge her head into an empty\n      cell, disgorge her honey, and prepare to set forth again. At the door of\n      the hive I had placed a glass box, divided by a trap into two\n      compartments. The bee flew into this box; and as she was alone, and no\n      other bee seemed to accompany or follow her, I imprisoned her and left her\n      there. I then repeated the experiment on twenty different bees in\n      succession. When the marked bee reappeared alone, I imprisoned her as I\n      had imprisoned the first. But eight of them came to the threshold of the\n      hive and entered the box accompanied by two or three friends. By means of\n      the trap I was able to separate the marked bee from her companions, and to\n      keep her a prisoner in the first compartment. Then, having marked her\n      companions with a different colour, I threw open the second compartment\n      and set them at liberty, myself returning quickly to my study to await\n      their arrival. Now it is evident that if a verbal or magnetic\n      communication had passed, indicating the place, describing the way, etc.,\n      a certain number of the bees, having been furnished with this information,\n      should have found their way to my room. I am compelled to admit that there\n      came but a single one. Was this mere chance, or had she followed\n      instructions received? The experiment was insufficient, but circumstances\n      prevented me from carrying it further. I released the \"baited\" bees, and\n      my study soon was besieged by the buzzing crowd to whom they had taught\n      the way to the treasure.",
                "We need not concern ourselves with this incomplete attempt of mine, for\n      many other curious traits compel us to recognise the existence among the\n      bees of spiritual communications that go beyond a mere \"yes\" or \"no,\" and\n      that are manifest in cases where mere example or gesture would not be\n      sufficient. Of such, for instance, are the remarkable harmony of their\n      work in the hive, the extraordinary division of labour, the regularity\n      with which one worker will take the place of another, etc. I have often\n      marked bees that went foraging in the morning, and found that, in the\n      afternoon, unless flowers were specially abundant, they would be engaged\n      in heating and fanning the brood-cells, or perhaps would form part of the\n      mysterious, motionless curtain in whose midst the wax-makers and sculptors\n      would be at work. Similarly I have noticed that workers whom I have seen\n      gathering pollen for the whole of one day, will bring no pollen back on\n      the morrow, but will concern themselves exclusively with the search for\n      nectar, and vice-versa.",

Georges de Layens, the celebrated\n      French apiarist, terms the \"Distribution of Bees over Melliferous Plants.\"\n      Day after day, at the first hour of sunrise, the explorers of the dawn\n      return, and the hive awakes to receive the good news of the earth. \"The\n      lime trees are blossoming to-day on the banks of the canal.\" \"The grass by\n      the roadside is gay with white clover.\" \"The sage and the lotus are about\n      to open.\" \"The mignonette, the lilies are overflowing with pollen.\"\n      Whereupon the bees must organise quickly, and arrange to divide the work.\n      Five thousand of the sturdiest will sully forth to the lime trees, while\n      three thousand juniors go and refresh the white clover. Those who\n      yesterday were absorbing nectar from the corollas will to-day repose their\n      tongue and the glands of their sac, and gather red pollen from the\n      mignonette, or yellow pollen from the tall lilies; for never shall you see\n      a bee collecting or mixing pollen of a different colour or species; and\n      indeed one of the chief pre-occupations of the hive is the methodical\n      bestowal of these pollens in the store-rooms, in strict accordance with\n      their origin and colour. Thus does the hidden genius issue its commands.\n      The workers immediately sally forth, in long black files, whereof each one\n      will fly straight to its allotted task. \"The bees,\" says De Layens, \"would\n      seem to be perfectly informed as to the locality, the relative melliferous\n      value, and the distance of every melliferous plant within a certain radius\n      from the hive.",
                "\"If we carefully note the different directions in which these foragers\n      fly, and observe in detail the harvest they gather from the various plants\n      around, we shall find that the workers distribute themselves over the\n      flowers in proportion not only to the numbers of flowers of one species,\n      but also to their melliferous value. Nay, more -- they make daily\n      calculations as to the means of obtaining the greatest possible wealth of\n      saccharine liquid. In the spring, for instance, after the willows have\n      bloomed, when the fields still are bare, and the first flowers of the\n      woods are the one resource of the bees, we shall see them eagerly visiting\n      gorse and violets, lungworts and anemones. But, a few days later, when\n      fields of cabbage and colza begin to flower in sufficient abundance, we\n      shall find that the bees will almost entirely forsake the plants in the\n      woods, though these be still in full blossom, and will confine their\n      visits to the flowers of cabbage and colza alone. In this fashion they\n      regulate, day by day, their distribution over the plants, so as to collect\n      the greatest value of saccharine liquid in the least possible time.",
                "\"It may fairly be claimed, therefore, for the colony of bees that, in its\n      harvesting labours no less than in its internal economy, it is able to\n      establish a rational distribution of the number of workers without ever\n      disturbing the principle of the division of labour.\"",

And this fact, though it decide\n      nothing perhaps, still holds an honourable place in the mass of tiny facts\n      that help to throw light on our position in this world. It affords even,\n      if considered from a certain point of view, a fresh proof of the most\n      enigmatic part of our being; for the superpositions of destinies that we\n      find in the hive are surveyed by us from an eminence loftier than any we\n      can attain for the contemplation of the destinies of man. There we see\n      before us, in miniature, the large and simple lines that in our own\n      disproportionate sphere we never have the occasion to disentangle and\n      follow to the end.

And may we not reasonably ask ourselves whether\n      the mere size of a body, and the room that it fills in time and space, can\n      modify to the extent we imagine the secret idea of nature; the idea that\n      we try to discover in the little history of the hive, which in a few days\n      already is ancient, no less than in the great history of man, of whom\n      three generations overlap a long century?",

We can only say that they will remain thus suspended\n      for a period extending from eighteen to twenty-four hours, in a\n      temperature so high that one might almost believe that a fire was burning\n      in the hollow of the hive; and then white and transparent scales will\n      appear at the opening of four little pockets that every bee has underneath\n      its abdomen.",
                "When the bodies of most of those who form the inverted cone have thus been\n      adorned with ivory tablets, we shall see one of the bees, as though\n      suddenly inspired, abruptly detach herself from the mass, and climb over\n      the backs of the passive crowd till she reach the inner pinnacle of the\n      cupola. To this she will fix herself solidly, dislodging, with repeated\n      blows of her head, such of her neighbours as may seem to hamper her\n      movements. Then, with her mouth and claws, she will seize one of the eight\n      scales that hang from her abdomen, and at once proceed to clip it and\n      plane it, extend it, knead it with her saliva, bend it and flatten it,\n      roll it and straighten it, with the skill of a carpenter handling a\n      pliable panel. When at last the substance, thus treated, appears to her to\n      possess the required dimensions and consistency, she will attach it to the\n      highest point of the dome, thus laying the first, or rather the keystone\n      of the new town; for we have here an inverted city, hanging down from the\n      sky, and not rising from the bosom of earth like a city of men.",

Another will\n      at once take her place, continue the work at the point where the first one\n      has left it, add on her own, change and adjust whatever may seem to offend\n      the ideal plan of the tribe, then vanish in her turn, to be succeeded by a\n      third, a fourth, and a fifth, all appearing unexpectedly, suddenly, one\n      after the other, none completing the work, but each bringing her share to\n      the task in which all combine.",

So soon as its thickness may be deemed sufficient, we shall see\n      another bee emerge from the mass, her physical appearance differing\n      appreciably from that of the foundresses who preceded her. And her manner\n      displays such settled conviction, her movements are followed so eagerly by\n      all the crowd, that we almost might fancy that some illustrious engineer\n      had been summoned to trace in the void the site of the first cell of all,\n      from which every other must mathematically depend. This bee belongs to the\n      sculptor or carver class of workers; she produces no wax herself and is\n      content to deal with the materials others provide. She locates the first\n      cell, scoops into the block for an instant, lays the wax she has removed\n      from the cavity on the borders around it; and then, like the foundresses,\n      abruptly departs and abandons her model. Her place is taken at once by an\n      impatient worker, who continues the task that a third will finish, while\n      others close by are attacking the rest of the surface and the opposite\n      side of the wall; each one obeying the general law of interrupted and\n      successive labour, as though it were an inherent principle of the hive\n      that the pride of toil should be distributed, and every achievement be\n      anonymous and common to all, that it might thereby become more fraternal.",

In form it will still\n      be lenticular, for the little prismatic tubes that compose it are unequal\n      in length, and diminish in proportion as they recede from the centre to\n      the extremities. In thickness and appearance at present it more or less\n      resembles a human tongue whose sides might be formed of hexagonal cells,\n      contiguous, and placed back to back.",

                "Their plan must therefore embrace the final thickness of every comb, which\n      will be from eighty-eight to ninety-two hundredths of an inch, and at the\n      same time the width of the avenues between, which must be about half an\n      inch, or in other words twice the height of a bee, since there must be\n      room to pass back to back between the combs.",
                "The bees, however, are not infallible, nor does their certainty appear\n      mechanical. They will commit grave errors at times, when circumstances\n      present unusual difficulty. They will often leave too much space, or too\n      little, between the combs. This they will remedy as best they can, either\n      by giving an oblique twist to the comb that too nearly approaches the\n      other, or by introducing an irregular comb into the gap. \"The bees\n      sometimes make mistakes,\" Reaumur remarks on this subject, \"and herein we\n      may find yet another fact which appears to prove that they reason.\"",
                "{54}",
                "We know that the bees construct four kinds of cells. First of all, the\n      royal cells, which are exceptional, and contrived somewhat in the shape of\n      an acorn; then the large cells destined for the rearing of males and\n      storing of provisions when flowers super-abound; and the small cells,\n      serving as workers' cradles and ordinary store-rooms, which occupy\n      normally about four-fifths of the built-over surface of the hive. And\n      lastly, so as to connect in orderly fashion the larger cells with the\n      small, the bees will erect a certain number of what are known as\n      transition cells. These must of necessity be irregular in form; but so\n      unerringly accurate are the dimensions of the second and third types that,\n      at the time when the decimal system was established, and a fixed measure\n      sought in nature to serve as a starting-point and an incontestable\n      standard, it was proposed by Reaumur to select for this purpose the cell\n      of the bee.*",
                "*It was as well, perhaps, that this standard was not\n     adopted. For although the diameter of the cells is admirably\n     regular, it is, like all things produced by a living\n     organism, not mathematically invariable in the same hive.\n     Further, as M. Maurice Girard has pointed out, the apothem\n     of the cell varies among different races of bees, so that\n     the standard would alter from hive to hive, according to the\n     species of bee that inhabited it.",
                "Each of the cells is an hexagonal tube placed on a pyramidal base; and two\n      layers of these tubes form the comb, their bases being opposed to each\n      other in such fashion that each of the three rhombs or lozenges which on\n      one side constitute the pyramidal base of one cell, composes at the same\n      time the pyramidal base of three cells on the other. It is in these\n      prismatic tubes that the honey is stored; and to prevent its escaping\n      during the period of maturation, -- which would infallibly happen if\n      the tubes were as strictly horizontal as they appear to be, -- the bees\n      incline them slightly, to an angle of 4 deg or 5 deg.",
                "\"Besides the economy of wax,\" says Reaumur, when considering this\n      marvellous construction in its entirety, \"besides the economy of wax that\n      results from the disposition of the cells, and the fact that this\n      arrangement allows the bees to fill the comb without leaving a single spot\n      vacant, there are other advantages also with respect to the solidity of\n      the work. The angle at the base of each cell, the apex of the pyramidal\n      cavity, is buttressed by the ridge formed by two faces of the hexagon of\n      another cell. The two triangles, or extensions of the hexagon faces which\n      fill one of the convergent angles of the cavity enclosed by the three\n      rhombs, form by their junction a plane angle on the side they touch; each\n      of these angles, concave within the cell, supports, on its convex side,\n      one of the sheets employed to form the hexagon of another cell; the sheet,\n      pressing on this angle, resists the force which is tending to push it\n      outwards; and in this fashion the angles are strengthened. Every advantage\n      that could be desired with regard to the solidity of each cell is procured\n      by its own formation and its position with reference to the others.\"",

Mathematicians know that there is not a fourth way\n      possible in which a plane shall be cut into little spaces that shall be\n      equal, similar, and regular, without useless spaces. Of the three figures,\n      the hexagon is the most proper for convenience and strength. Bees, as if\n      they knew this, make their cells regular hexagons.",

Another savant, Maraldi, had measured as\n     exactly as possible the angles of the rhombs constructed by\n     the bees, and discovered the larger to be 109 deg 28', and\n     the other 70 deg 32'. Between the two solutions there was a\n     difference, therefore, of only 2'. It is probable that the\n     error, if error there be, should be attributed to Maraldi\n     rather than to the bees; for it is impossible for any\n     instrument to measure the angles of the cells, which are not\n     very clearly defined, with infallible precision.",

                "I myself do not believe that the bees indulge in these abstruse\n      calculations; but, on the other hand, it seems equally impossible to me\n      that such astounding results can be due to chance alone, or to the mere\n      force of circumstance. The wasps, for instance, also build combs with\n      hexagonal cells, so that for them the problem was identical, and they have\n      solved it in a far less ingenious fashion. Their combs have only one layer\n      of cells, thus lacking the common base that serves the bees for their two\n      opposite layers. The wasps' comb, therefore, is not only less regular, but\n      also less substantial; and so wastefully constructed that, besides loss of\n      material, they must sacrifice about a third of the available space and a\n      quarter of the energy they put forth. Again, we find that the trigonae and\n      meliponae, which are veritable and domesticated bees, though of less\n      advanced civilisation, erect only one row of rearing-cells, and support\n      their horizontal, superposed combs on shapeless and costly columns of wax.\n      Their provision-cells are merely great pots, gathered together without any\n      order; and, at the point between the spheres where these might have\n      intersected and induced a profitable economy of space and material, the\n      meliponae clumsily insert a section of cells with flat walls. Indeed, to\n      compare one of their nests with the mathematical cities of our own\n      honey-flies, is like imagining a hamlet composed of primitive huts side by\n      side with a modern town; whose ruthless regularity is the logical, though\n      perhaps somewhat charmless, result of the genius of man, that to-day, more\n      fiercely than ever before, seeks to conquer space, matter, and time.",

                "There is a theory, originally propounded by Buffon and now revived, which\n      assumes that the bees have not the least intention of constructing\n      hexagons with a pyramidal base, but that their desire is merely to\n      contrive round cells in the wax; only, that as their neighbours, and those\n      at work on the opposite side of the comb, are digging at the same moment\n      and with the same intentions, the points where the cells meet must of\n      necessity become hexagonal. Besides, it is said, this is precisely what\n      happens to crystals, the scales of certain kinds of fish, soap-bubbles,\n      etc., as it happens in the following experiment that Buffon suggested.\n      \"If,\" he said, \"you fill a dish with peas or any other cylindrical bean,\n      pour as much water into it as the space between the beans will allow,\n      close it carefully and then boil the water, you will find that all these\n      cylinders have become six-sided columns. And the reason is evident, being\n      indeed purely mechanical; each of the cylindrical beans tends, as it\n      swells, to occupy the utmost possible space within a given space;\n      wherefore it follows that the reciprocal compression compels them all to\n      become hexagonal. Similarly each bee seeks to occupy the utmost possible\n      space within a given space, with the necessary result that, its body being\n      cylindrical, the cells become hexagonal for the same reason as before,\n      viz., the working of reciprocal obstacles.\"",

                "These reciprocal obstacles, it would seem, are capable of marvellous\n      achievement; on the same principle, doubtless, that the vices of man\n      produce a general virtue, whereby the human race, hateful often in its\n      individuals, ceases to be so in the mass. We might reply, first of all,\n      with Brougham, Kirby and Spence, and others, that experiments with peas\n      and soap-bubbles prove nothing; for the reason that in both cases the\n      pressure produces only irregular forms, and in no wise explains the\n      existence of the prismatic base of the cells. But above all we might\n      answer that there are more ways than one of dealing with rigid necessity;\n      that the wasp, the humble-bee, the trigonae and meliponae of Mexico and\n      Brazil achieve very different and manifestly inferior results, although\n      the circumstances, and their own intentions, are absolutely identical with\n      those of the bees. It might further be urged that if the bee's cell does\n      indeed follow the law that governs crystals, snow, soap-bubbles, as well\n      as Buffon's boiled peas, it also, through its general symmetry,\n      disposition in opposite layers, and angle of inclination, obeys many other\n      laws that are not to be found in matter. May we not say, too, of man that\n      all his genius is comprised in his fashion of handling kindred\n      necessities? And if it appear to us that his manner of treating these is\n      the best there can possibly be, the reason only can lie in the absence of\n      a judge superior to ourselves.

I cut into the\n      circumference of this disc, at the intersecting point of the pyramidal\n      cells; inserted a piece of tin on the base of one of these sections,\n      shaped exactly to its dimensions, and possessed of resistance sufficient\n      to prevent the bees from bending or twisting it. Then I replaced the slice\n      of comb, duly furnished with its slab of tin, on the spot whence I had\n      removed it; so that, while one side of the comb presented no abnormal\n      feature, the damage having been repaired, the other displayed a sort of\n      deep cavity, covering the space of about thirty cells, with the piece of\n      tin as its base. The bees were disconcerted at first; they flocked in\n      numbers to inspect and examine this curious chasm; day after day they\n      wandered agitatedly to and fro, apparently unable to form a decision. But,\n      as I fed them copiously every evening, there came a moment when they had\n      no more cells available for the storage of provisions. Thereupon they\n      probably summoned their great engineers, distinguished sculptors, and\n      wax-workers, and invited them to turn this useless cavity to profitable\n      account.",

In the upper\n      semicircle of the disc they then began to construct three or four cells,\n      uniting these to the hooks. Each of these transition, or accommodation,\n      cells was more or less deformed at the top, to allow of its being soldered\n      to the adjoining cell on the comb; but its lower portion already designed\n      on the tin three very clear angles, whence there ran three little straight\n      lines that correctly indicated the first half of the following cell.",
                "After forty-eight hours, and notwithstanding the fact that only three bees\n      at a time were able to work in the cavity, the entire surface of the tin\n      was covered with outlined cells. These were less regular, certainly, than\n      those of an ordinary comb; wherefore the queen, having inspected them,\n      wisely declined to lay any eggs there, for the generation that would have\n      arisen therefrom would necessarily have been deformed. Each cell, however,\n      was a perfect hexagon; nor did it contain a single crooked line, a single\n      curved figure or angle. And yet the ordinary conditions had all been\n      changed; the cells had neither been scooped out of a block, according to\n      Huber's description, nor had they been designed within a waxen hood, and,\n      from being circular at first, been subsequently converted into hexagons by\n      the pressure of adjoining cells, as explained by Darwin. Neither could\n      there be question here of reciprocal obstacles, the cells having been\n      formed one by one, and their first lines traced on what practically was a\n      bare table. It would seem incontestable, therefore, that the hexagon is\n      not merely the result of mechanical necessities, but that it has its true\n      place in the plans, the experience, the intellect and will of the bee. I\n      may relate here another curious instance of the workers' sagacity: the\n      cells they built on the tin had no other base than the metal itself. The\n      engineers of the corps had evidently decided that the tin could adequately\n      retain the honey; and had considered that, the substance being\n      impermeable, they need not waste the material they value so highly by\n      covering the metal with a layer of wax. But, a short time after, some\n      drops of honey having been placed in two of these cells, the bees\n      discovered, in tasting it, that the contact of the metal had a\n      deteriorating effect. Thereupon they reconsidered the matter, and covered\n      over with wax the entire surface of the tin.",

At the moment when they begin to construct one of these strips at\n      the top of the hive, the waxen wall (which is its rough model, and will\n      later be thinned and extended) is still very thick, and completely\n      excludes the fifty or sixty bees at work on its inner face from the fifty\n      or sixty simultaneously engaged in carving the outer, so that it is wholly\n      impossible for one group to see the other, unless indeed their sight be\n      able to penetrate opaque matter. And yet there is not a hole that is\n      scooped on the inner surface, not a fragment of wax that is added, but\n      corresponds with mathematical precision to a protuberance or cavity on the\n      outer surface, and vice versa. How does this happen? How is it that one\n      does not dig too deep, another not deep enough? Whence the invariable\n      magical coincidence between the angles of the lozenges? What is it tells\n      the bees that at this point they must begin, and at that point stop? Once\n      again we must content ourselves with the reply, that is no reply: \"It is a\n      mystery of the hive.\"",
                "Huber has sought to explain this mystery by suggesting that the pressure\n      of the bees' hooks and teeth may possibly produce slight projections, at\n      regular intervals, on the opposite side of the comb; or that they may be\n      able to estimate the thickness of the block by the flexibility,\n      elasticity, or some other physical quality of the wax; or again, that\n      their antennae, which seem so well adapted for the questioning of the\n      finer, less evident side of things, may serve as a compass in the\n      invisible; or, lastly, that the position of every cell may derive\n      mathematically from the arrangement and dimensions of the cells on the\n      first row, and thus dispense with the need for further measurement. But\n      these explanations are evidently insufficient; the first are mere\n      hypotheses that cannot be verified, the others do no more than transplant\n      the mystery. And useful as it may be to transplant mystery as often as we\n      possibly can, it were not wise to imagine that a mystery has ceased to be\n      because we have shifted its home.",

                "Now let us leave these dreary building grounds, this geometrical desert of\n      cells. The combs have been started, and are becoming habitable. Though it\n      be here the infinitely little that, without apparent hope, adds itself to\n      the infinitely little; though our eye with its limited vision look and see\n      nothing, the work of wax, halting neither by day nor by night, will\n      advance with incredible quickness. The impatient queen already has more\n      than once paced the stockades that gleam white in the darkness; and no\n      sooner is the first row of dwellings complete than she takes possession\n      with her escort of counsellors, guardians, or servants -- for we know\n      not whether she lead or be led, be venerated or supervised. When the spot\n      has been reached that she, or her urgent advisers, may regard as\n      favourable, she arches her back, bends forward, and introduces the\n      extremity of her long spindle-shaped abdomen into one of the cells;\n      the-little eager heads of her escort meanwhile forming a passionate circle\n      around her, watching her with their enormous black eyes, supporting her,\n      caressing her wings, and waving their feverish antennae as though to\n      encourage, incite, or congratulate. You may easily discover the spot where\n      the queen shall be found by the sort of starry cockade, or oval brooch\n      perhaps of the imposing kind our grandmothers used to wear, of which she\n      forms the central stone. And one may mention here the curious fact that\n      the workers always avoid turning their back on the queen. No sooner has\n      she approached a group than they will invariably arrange themselves so as\n      to face her with eyes and antennae, and to walk backwards before her. It\n      is a token of respect, or of solicitude, that, unlikely as it may seem, is\n      nevertheless constant and general. But to return to the queen. During the\n      slight spasm that visibly accompanies the emission of an egg, one of her\n      daughters will often throw her arms round her and appear to be whispering\n      to her, brow pressed to brow and mouth to mouth. But the queen, in no wise\n      disturbed by this somewhat bold demonstration, takes her time, tranquilly,\n      calmly, wholly absorbed by the mission that would seem amorous delight to\n      her rather than labour. And after some seconds she will rise, very\n      quietly, take a step back, execute a slight turn on herself, and proceed\n      to the next cell, into which she will first, before introducing her\n      abdomen, dip her head to make sure that all is in order and that she is\n      not laying twice in the same cell; and in the meanwhile two or three of\n      her escort will have plunged into the cell she has quitted to see whether\n      the work be duly accomplished, and to care for, and tenderly house, the\n      little bluish egg she has laid.",
                "From this moment, up to the first frosts of autumn, she does not cease\n      laying; she lays while she is being fed, and even in her sleep, if indeed\n      she sleeps at all, she still lays. She represents henceforth the devouring\n      force of the future, which invades every corner of the kingdom. Step by\n      step she pursues the unfortunate workers who are exhaustedly, feverishly\n      erecting the cradles her fecundity demands. We have here the union of two\n      mighty instincts; and their workings throw into light, though they leave\n      unresolved, many an enigma of the hive.",
                "It will happen, for instance, that the workers will distance her, and\n      acquire a certain start; whereupon, mindful of their duties as careful\n      housewives to provide for the bad days ahead, they hasten to fill with\n      honey the cells they have wrested from the avidity of the species. But the\n      queen approaches; material wealth must give way to the scheme of nature;\n      and the distracted workers are compelled with all speed to remove the\n      importunate treasure.",
                "But assume them to be a whole comb ahead, and to have no longer before\n      them her who stands for the tyranny of days they shall none of them see;\n      we find then that they eagerly, hurriedly, build a zone of large cells,\n      cells for males; whose construction is very much easier, and far more\n      rapid. When the queen in her turn attains this unthankful zone, she will\n      regretfully lay a few eggs there, then cease, pass beyond, and clamour for\n      more workers' cells. Her daughters obey; little by little they reduce the\n      cells; and then the pursuit starts afresh, till at last the insatiable\n      mother shall have traversed the whole circumference of the hive, and have\n      returned to the first cells. These, by this time, will be empty; for the\n      first generation will have sprung into life, soon to go forth, from their\n      shadowy corner of birth, disperse over the neighbouring blossoms, people\n      the rays of the sun and quicken the smiling hours; and then sacrifice\n      themselves in their turn to the new generations that are already filling\n      their place in the cradles.",

                "We have seen that the workers, when free for the moment from the\n      threatening fecundity of the queen, hasten to erect cells for provisions,\n      whose construction is more economical and capacity greater. We have seen,\n      too, that the queen prefers to lay in the smaller cells, for which she is\n      incessantly clamouring. When these are wanting, however, or till they be\n      provided, she resigns herself to laying her eggs in the large cells she\n      finds on her road.",
                "These eggs, though absolutely identical with those from which workers are\n      hatched, will give birth to males, or drones. Now, conversely to what\n      takes place when a worker is turned into queen, it is here neither the\n      form nor the capacity of the cell that produces this change; for from an\n      egg laid in a large cell and afterwards transferred to that of a worker (a\n      most difficult operation, because of the microscopic minuteness and\n      extreme fragility of the egg, but one that I have four or five times\n      successfully accomplished) there will issue an undeniable male, though\n      more or less atrophied. It follows, therefore, that the queen must possess\n      the power, while laying, of knowing or determining the sex of the egg, and\n      of adapting it to the cell over which she is bending. She will rarely make\n      a mistake. How does she contrive, from among the myriad eggs her ovaries\n      contain, to separate male from female, and lower them, at will, into the\n      unique oviduct?",
                "Here, yet again, there confronts us an enigma of the hive; and in this\n      case one of the most unfathomable. We know that the virgin queen is not\n      sterile; but the eggs that she lays will produce only males. It is not\n      till after the impregnation of the nuptial flight that she can produce\n      workers or drones at will. The nuptial flight places her permanently in\n      possession, till death, of the spermatozoa torn from her unfortunate\n      lover. These spermatozoa, whose number Dr. Leuckart estimates at\n      twenty-five millions, are preserved alive in a special gland known as the\n      spermatheca, that is situate under the ovaries, at the entrance to the\n      common oviduct. It is imagined that the narrow aperture of the smaller\n      cells, and the manner in which the form of this aperture compels the queen\n      to bend forward, exercise a certain pressure upon the spermatheca, in\n      consequence of which the spermatozoa spring forth and fecundate the egg as\n      it passes. In the large cells this pressure would not take place, and the\n      spermatheca would therefore not open. Others, again, believe that the\n      queen has perfect control over the muscles that open and close the\n      spermatheca on the vagina; and these muscles are certainly very numerous,\n      complex, and powerful. For myself, I incline to the second of these\n      hypotheses, though I do not for a moment pretend to decide which is the\n      more correct; for indeed, the further we go and the more closely we study,\n      the more plainly is it brought home to us that we merely are waifs\n      shipwrecked on the ocean of nature; and ever and anon, from a sudden wave\n      that shall be more transparent than others, there leaps forth a fact that\n      in an instant confounds all we imagined we knew. But the reason of my\n      preferring the second theory is that, for one thing, the experiments of a\n      Bordeaux bee-keeper, M. Drory, have shown that in cases where all the\n      large cells have been removed from the hive, the mother will not hesitate,\n      when the moment for laying male eggs has come, to deposit these in\n      workers' cells; and that, inversely, she will lay workers' eggs in cells\n      provided for males, if she have no others at her disposal. And, further,\n      we learn from the interesting observations of M. Fabre on the Osmiae,\n      which are wild and olitary bees of the Gastrilegidae family, that not only\n      does the Osmia know in advance the sex of the egg she will lay, but that\n      this sex is \"optional for the mother, who decides it in accordance with\n      the space of which she disposes; this space being often governed by chance\n      and not to be modified; and she will deposit a male egg here and a female\n      there.\" I shall not enter into the details of the great French\n      entomologist's experiments, for they are exceedingly minute, and would\n      take us too far. But whichever be the hypothesis we prefer to accept,\n      either will serve to explain the queen's inclination to lay her eggs in\n      workers' cells, without it being necessary to credit her with the least\n      concern for the future.",
                "It is not impossible that this slave-mother, whom we are inclined to pity,\n      may be indeed a great amorist, a great voluptuary, deriving a certain\n      enjoyment, an after-taste, as it were, of her one marriage-flight, from\n      the union of the male and female principle that thus comes to pass in her\n      being. Here again nature, never so ingenious, so cunningly prudent and\n      diverse, as when contriving her snares of love, will not have failed to\n      provide a certain pleasure as a bait in the interest of the species. And\n      yet let us pause for a moment, and not become the dupes of our own\n      explanation. For indeed, to attribute an idea of this kind to nature, and\n      regard that as sufficient, is like flinging a stone into an unfathomable\n      gulf we may find in the depths of a grotto, and imagining that the sounds\n      it creates as it falls shall answer our every question, or reveal to us\n      aught beside the immensity of the abyss.",

A purely fortuitous chain of events has allowed this special\n      manifestation to attract our attention; but a thousand others, no less\n      interesting, perhaps, and informed with no less intelligence, have\n      vanished, not meeting with a like good-fortune, and have lost for ever the\n      chance of exciting our wonder. It were rash to affirm aught beside; and\n      all that remains, our reflections, our obstinate search for the final\n      cause, our admiration and hopes -- all these in truth are no more than\n      our feeble cry as, in the depths of the unknown, we clash against what is\n      more unknowable still; and this feeble cry declares the highest degree of\n      individual existence attainable for us on this mute and impenetrable\n      surface, even as the flight of the condor, the song of the nightingale,\n      reveal to them the highest degree of existence their species allows. But\n      the evocation of this feeble cry, whenever opportunity offers, is none the\n      less one of our most unmistakable duties; nor should we let ourselves be\n      discouraged by its apparent futility."

                "Do obstacles offer no barrier to their sight; do they guide themselves by\n      certain indications and landmarks; or do they possess that peculiar,\n      imperfectly understood sense that we ascribe to the swallows and pigeons,\n      for instance, and term the \"sense of direction\"? The experiments of J. H.\n      Fabre, of Lubbock, and, above all, of Romanes (Nature, 29 Oct. 1886) seem\n      to establish that it is not this strange instinct that guides them. I\n      have, on the other hand, more than once noticed that they appear to pay no\n      attention to the colour or form of the hive. They are attracted rather by\n      the ordinary appearance of the platform on which their home reposes, by\n      the position of the entrance, and of the alighting-board. But this even is\n      merely subsidiary; were the front of the hive to be altered from top to\n      bottom, during the workers' absence, they would still unhesitatingly\n      direct their course to it from out the far depths of the horizon; and only\n      when confronted by the unrecognisable threshold would they seem for one\n      instant to pause. Such experiments as lie in our power point rather to\n      their guiding themselves by an extraordinarily minute and precise\n      appreciation of landmarks. It is not the hive that they seem to remember,\n      but its position, calculated to the minutest fraction, in its relation to\n      neighbouring objects. And so marvellous is this appreciation, so\n      mathematically certain, so profoundly inscribed in their memory, that if,\n      after five months' hibernation in some obscure cellar, the hive, when\n      replaced on the platform, should be set a little to right or to left of\n      its former position, all the workers, on their return from the earliest\n      flowers, will infallibly steer their direct and unwavering course to the\n      precise spot that it filled the previous year; and only after some\n      hesitation and groping will they discover the door which stands not now\n      where it once had stood. It is as though space had preciously preserved,\n      the whole winter through, the indelible track of their flight: as though\n      the print of their tiny, laborious footsteps, still lay graven in the sky.",
                "If the hive be displaced, therefore, many bees will lose their way; except\n      in the case of their having been carried far from their former home, and\n      finding the country completely transformed that they had grown to know\n      perfectly within a radius of two or three miles; for then, if care be\n      taken to warn them, by means of a little gangway connecting with the\n      alighting-board, at the entrance to the hive, that some change has\n      occurred, they will at once proceed to seek new bearings and create fresh\n      landmarks.",

                "And now let us return to the city that is being repeopled, where myriad\n      cradles are incessantly opening, and the solid walls even appear to be\n      moving. But this city still lacks a queen. Seven or eight curious\n      structures arise from the centre of one of the combs, and remind us,\n      scattered as they are over the surface of the ordinary cells, of the\n      circles and protuberances that appear so strange on the photographs of the\n      moon. They are a species of capsule, contrived of wrinkled wax or of\n      inclined glands, hermetically sealed, which fills the place of three or\n      four workers' cells. As a rule, they are grouped around the same point;\n      and a numerous guard keep watch, with singular vigilance and restlessness,\n      over this region that seems instinct with an indescribable prestige. It is\n      here that the mothers are formed. In each one of these capsules, before\n      the swarm departs, an egg will be placed by the mother, or more probably -- though\n      as to this we have no certain knowledge -- by one of the workers; an\n      egg that she will have taken from some neighbouring cell, and that is\n      absolutely identical with those from which workers are hatched.",
                "From this egg, after three days, a small larva will issue, and receive a\n      special and very abundant nourishment; and henceforth we are able to\n      follow, step by step, the movements of one of those magnificently vulgar\n      methods of nature on which, were we dealing with men, we should bestow the\n      august name of fatality. The little larva, thanks to this regimen, assumes\n      an exceptional development; and in its ideas, no less than in its body,\n      there ensues so considerable a change that the bee to which it will give\n      birth might almost belong to an entirely different race of insects.",
                "Four or five years will be the period of her life, instead of the six or\n      seven weeks of the ordinary worker. Her abdomen will be twice as long, her\n      colour more golden, and clearer; her sting will be curved, and her eyes\n      have seven or eight thousand facets instead of twelve or thirteen\n      thousand. Her brain will be smaller, but she will possess enormous\n      ovaries, and a special organ besides, the spermatheca, that will render\n      her almost an hermaphrodite. None of the instincts will be hers that\n      belong to a life of toil; she will have no brushes, no pockets wherein to\n      secrete the wax, no baskets to gather the pollen. The habits, the\n      passions, that we regard as inherent in the bee, will all be lacking in\n      her. She will not crave for air, or the light of the sun; she will die\n      without even once having tasted a flower. Her existence will pass in the\n      shadow, in the midst of a restless throng; her sole occupation the\n      indefatigable search for cradles that she must fill. On the other hand she\n      alone will know the disquiet of love. Not even twice, it may be, in her\n      life shall she look on the light -- for the departure of the swarm is\n      by no means inevitable; on one occasion only, perhaps, will she make use\n      of her wings, but then it will be to fly to her lover. It is strange to\n      see so many things -- organs, ideas, desires, habits, an entire destiny -- depending,\n      not on a germ, which were the ordinary miracle of the plant, the animal,\n      and man, but on a curious inert substance: a drop of honey.*",
                "*It is generally admitted to-day that workers and queens,\n     after the hatching of the egg, receive the same\n     nourishment, -- a kind of milk, very rich in nitrogen, that a\n     special gland in the nurses' head secretes. But after a few\n     days the worker larvae are weaned, and put on a coarser diet\n     of honey and pollen; whereas the future queen, until she be\n     fully developed, is copiously fed on the precious milk known\n     as \"royal jelly.\"",

                "About a week has passed since the departure of the old queen. The royal\n      nymphs asleep in the capsules are not all of the same age, for it is to\n      the interest of the bees that the births should be nicely gradationed, and\n      take place at regular intervals, in accordance with their possible desire\n      for a second swarm, a third, or even a fourth. The workers have for some\n      hours now been actively thinning the walls of the ripest cell, while the\n      young queen, from within, has been simultaneously gnawing the rounded lid\n      of her prison. And at last her head appears; she thrusts herself forward;\n      and, with the help of the guardians who hasten eagerly to her, who brush\n      her, caress her, and clean her, she extricates herself altogether and\n      takes her first steps on the comb. At the moment of birth she too, like\n      the workers, is trembling and pale, but after ten minutes or so her legs\n      become stronger, and a strange restlessness seizes her; she feels that she\n      is not alone, that her kingdom has yet to be conquered, that close by\n      pretenders are hiding; and she eagerly paces the waxen walls in search of\n      her rivals. But there intervene here the mysterious decisions and wisdom\n      of instinct, of the spirit of the hive, or of the assembly of workers. The\n      most surprising feature of all, as we watch these things happening before\n      us in a hive of glass, is the entire absence of hesitation, of the\n      slightest division of opinion. There is not a trace of discussion or\n      discord. The atmosphere of the city is one of absolute unanimity,\n      preordained, which reigns over all; and every one of the bees would appear\n      to know in advance the thought of her sisters. And yet this moment is the\n      gravest, the most vital, in their entire history. They have to choose\n      between three or four courses whose results, in the distant future, will\n      be totally different; which, too, the slightest accident may render\n      disastrous. They have to reconcile the multiplication of species -- which\n      is their passion, or innate duty -- with the preservation of the hive\n      and its people. They will err at times; they will successively send forth\n      three or four swarms, thereby completely denuding the mother-city; and\n      these swarms, too feeble to organise, will succumb, it may be, at the\n      approach of winter, caught unawares by this climate of ours, which is\n      different far from their original climate, that the bees, notwithstanding\n      all, have never forgotten. In such cases they suffer from what is known as\n      \"swarming fever;\" a condition wherein life, as in ordinary fever, reacting\n      too ardently on itself, passes its aim, completes the circle, and\n      discovers only death.",

But that the most\n      careful deliberation governs their choice is proved by the fact that we\n      are able to influence, or even determine it, by for instance reducing or\n      enlarging the space we accord them; or by removing combs full of honey,\n      and setting up, in their stead, empty combs which are well supplied with\n      workers' cells.",
                "The question they have to consider is not whether a second or third swarm\n      shall be immediately launched, -- for in arriving at such a decision\n      they would merely be blindly and thoughtlessly yielding to the caprice or\n      temptation of a favourable moment, -- but the instantaneous, unanimous\n      adoption of measures that shall enable them to issue a second swarm or\n      \"cast\" three or four days after the birth of the first queen, and a third\n      swarm three days after the departure of the second, with this first queen\n      at their head. It must be admitted, therefore, that we discover here a\n      perfectly reasoned system, and a mature combination of plans extending\n      over a period considerable indeed when compared with the brevity of the\n      bee's existence.",
                "These measures concern the care of the youthful queens who still lie\n      immured in their waxen prisons. Let us assume that the \"spirit of the\n      hive\" has pronounced against the despatch of a second swarm. Two courses\n      still remain open. The bees may permit the first-born of the royal\n      virgins, the one whose birth we have witnessed, to destroy her\n      sister-enemies; or they may elect to wait till she have performed the\n      perilous ceremony known as the \"nuptial flight,\" whereon the nation's\n      future depends. The immediate massacre will be authorised often, and often\n      denied; but in the latter case it is of course not easy for us to\n      pronounce whether the bees' decision be due to a desire for a second\n      swarm, or to their recognition of the dangers attending the nuptial\n      flight; for it will happen at times that, on account of the weather\n      unexpectedly becoming less favourable, or for some other reason we cannot\n      divine, they will suddenly change their mind, renounce the cast that they\n      had decreed, and destroy the royal progeny they had so carefully\n      preserved. But at present we will suppose that they have determined to\n      dispense with a second swarm, and that they accept the risks of the\n      nuptial flight. Our young queen hastens towards the large cradles, urged\n      on by her great desire, and the guard make way before her. Listening only\n      to her furious jealousy, she will fling herself on to the first cell she\n      comes across, madly strip off the wax with her teeth and claws, tear away\n      the cocoon that carpets the cell, and divest the sleeping princess of\n      every covering. If her rival should be already recognisable, the queen\n      will turn so that her sting may enter the capsule, and will frantically\n      stab it with her venomous weapon until the victim perish. She then becomes\n      calmer, appeased by the death that puts a term to the hatred of every\n      creature; she withdraws her sting, hurries to the adjoining cell, attacks\n      it and opens it, passing it by should she find in it only an imperfect\n      larva or nymph; nor does she pause till, at last, exhausted and\n      breathless, her claws and teeth glide harmless over the waxen walls.",
                "The bees that surround her have calmly watched her fury, have stood by,\n      inactive, moving only to leave her path clear; but no sooner has a cell\n      been pierced and laid waste than they eagerly flock to it, drag out the\n      corpse of the ravished nymph, or the still living larva, and thrust it\n      forth from the hive, thereupon gorging themselves with the precious royal\n      jelly that adheres to the sides of the cell. And finally, when the queen\n      has become too weak to persist in her passion, they will themselves\n      complete the massacre of the innocents; and the sovereign race, and their\n      dwellings, will all disappear.",
                "This is the terrible hour of the hive; the only occasion, with that of the\n      more justifiable execution of the drones, when the workers suffer discord\n      and death to be busy amongst them; and here, as often in nature, it is the\n      favoured of love who attract to themselves the most extraordinary shafts\n      of violent death.",
                "It will happen at times that two queens will be hatched simultaneously,\n      the occurrence being rare, however, for the bees take special care to\n      prevent it. But whenever this does take place, the deadly combat will\n      begin the moment they emerge from their cradles; and of this combat Huber\n      was the first to remark an extraordinary feature. Each time, it would seem\n      that the queens, in their passes, present their chitrinous cuirasses to\n      each other in such a fashion that the drawing of the sting would prove\n      mutually fatal; one might almost believe that, even as a god or goddess\n      was wont to interpose in the combats of the Iliad, so a god or a goddess,\n      the divinity of the race, perhaps, interposes here; and the two warriors,\n      stricken with simultaneous terror, divide and fly, to meet shortly after\n      and separate again should the double disaster once more menace the future\n      of their people; till at last one of them shall succeed in surprising her\n      clumsier or less wary rival, and in killing her without risk to herself.\n      For the law of the race has called for one sacrifice only.",
                "The cradles having thus been destroyed and the rivals all slain, the young\n      queen is accepted by her people; but she will not truly reign over them,\n      or be treated as was her mother before her, until the nuptial flight be\n      accomplished; for until she be impregnated the bees will hold her but\n      lightly, and render most passing homage. Her history, however, will rarely\n      be as uneventful as this, for the bees will not often renounce their\n      desire for a second swarm. In that case, as before, quick with the same\n      desires, the queen will approach the royal cells; but instead of meeting\n      with docile servants who second her efforts, she will find her path\n      blocked by a numerous and hostile guard. In her fury, and urged on by her\n      fixed idea, she will endeavour to force her way through, or to outflank\n      them; but everywhere sentinels are posted to protect the sleeping\n      princesses. She persists, she returns to the charge, to be repulsed with\n      ever increasing severity, to be somewhat roughly handled even, until at\n      last she begins vaguely to understand that these little inflexible workers\n      stand for a law before which that law must bend whereby she is inspired.",
                "And at last she goes, and wanders from comb to comb, her unsatisfied wrath\n      finding vent in a war-song, or angry complaint, that every bee-keeper\n      knows; resembling somewhat the note of a distant trumpet of silver; so\n      intense, in its passionate feebleness, as to be clearly audible, in the\n      evening especially, two or three yards from the double walls of the most\n      carefully enclosed hive.",
                "Upon the workers this royal cry has a magical effect. It terrifies them,\n      it induces a kind of respectful stupor; and when the queen sends it forth,\n      as she halts in front of the cells whose approach is denied her, the\n      guardians who have but this moment been hustling her, pushing her back,\n      will at once desist, and wait, with bent head, till the cry shall have\n      ceased to resound. Indeed, some believe that it is thanks to the prestige\n      of this cry, which the Sphinx Atropos imitates, that the latter is able to\n      enter the hive, and gorge itself with honey, without the least molestation\n      on the part of the bees.",
                "For two or three days, sometimes even for five, this indignant lament will\n      be heard, this challenge that the queen addresses to her well protected\n      rivals. And as these in their turn develop, in their turn grow anxious to\n      see the light, they too set to work to gnaw the lids of their cells. A\n      mighty disorder would now appear to threaten the republic. But the genius\n      of the hive, at the time that it formed its decision, was able to foretell\n      every consequence that might ensue; and the guardians have had their\n      instructions: they know exactly what must be done, hour by hour, to meet\n      the attacks of a foiled instinct, and conduct two opposite forces to a\n      successful issue. They are fully aware that if the young queens should\n      escape who now clamour for birth, they would fall into the hands of their\n      elder sister, by this time irresistible, who would destroy them one by\n      one. The workers, therefore, will pile on fresh layers of wax in\n      proportion as the prisoner reduces, from within, the walls of her tower;\n      and the impatient princess will ardently persist in her labour, little\n      suspecting that she has to deal with an enchanted obstacle, that rises\n      ever afresh from its ruin. She hears the war-cry of her rival; and already\n      aware of her royal duty and destiny, although she has not yet looked upon\n      life, nor knows what a hive may be, she answers the challenge from within\n      the depths of her prison. But her cry is different; it is stifled and\n      hollow, for it has to traverse the walls of a tomb; and, when night is\n      falling, and noises are hushed, and high over all there reigns the silence\n      of the stars, the apiarist who nears these marvellous cities and stands,\n      questioning, at their entrance, recognises and understands the dialogue\n      that is passing between the wandering queen and the virgins in prison.",

In that case they will allow the third queen to slaughter the\n      captives; ordinary life will at once be resumed, and pursued with the more\n      ardour for the reason that the workers are all very young, that the hive\n      is depopulated and impoverished, and that there are great voids to fill\n      before the arrival of winter.",

There confronts us here the great mystery -- or precaution -- of\n      Nature, that is known as parthenogenesis, and is common to a certain\n      number of insects, such as the aphides, the lepidoptera of the Psyche\n      genus, the hymenoptera of the Cynipede family, etc. The virgin queen is\n      able to lay; but from all the eggs that she will deposit in the cells, be\n      these large or small, there will issue males alone; and as these never\n      work, as they live at the expense of the females, as they never go\n      foraging except on their own account, and are generally incapable of\n      providing for their subsistence, the result will be, at the end of some\n      weeks, that the last exhausted worker will perish, and the colony be\n      ruined and totally annihilated. The queen, we have said, will produce\n      thousands of drones; and each of these will possess millions of the\n      spermatozoa whereof it is impossible that a single one can have penetrated\n      into the organism of the mother. That may not be more astounding, perhaps,\n      than a thousand other and analogous phenomena; and, indeed, when we\n      consider these problems, and more especially those of generation, the\n      marvellous and the unexpected confront us so constantly -- occurring\n      far more frequently, and above all in far less human fashion, than in the\n      most miraculous fairy stories -- that after a time astonishment becomes\n      so habitual with us that we almost cease to wonder. The fact, however, is\n      sufficiently curious to be worthy of notice. But, on the other hand, how\n      shall we explain to ourselves the aim that nature can have in thus\n      favouring the valueless drones at the cost of the workers who are so\n      essential? Is she afraid lest the females might perhaps be induced by\n      their intellect unduly to limit the number of their parasites, which,\n      destructive though they be, are still necessary for the preservation of\n      the race? Or is it merely an exaggerated reaction against the misfortune\n      of the unfruitful queen? Can we have here one of those blind and extreme\n      precautions which, ignoring the cause of the evil, overstep the remedy;\n      and, in the endeavour to prevent an unfortunate accident, bring about a\n      catastrophe? In reality -- though we must not forget that the natural,\n      primitive reality is different: from that of the present, for in the\n      original forest the colonies might well be far more scattered than they\n      are to-day -- in reality the queen's unfruitfulness will rarely be due\n      to the want of males, for these are very numerous always, and will flock\n      from afar; but rather to the rain, or the cold, that will have kept her\n      too long in the hive, and more frequently still to the imperfect state of\n      her wings, whereby she will be prevented from describing the high flight\n      in the air that the organ of the male demands. Nature, however, heedless\n      of these more intrinsic causes, is so deeply concerned with the\n      multiplication of males, that we sometimes find, in motherless hives, two\n      or three workers possessed of so great a desire to preserve the race that,\n      their atrophied ovaries notwithstanding, they will still endeavour to lay;\n      and, their organs expanding somewhat beneath the empire of this\n      exasperated sentiment, they will succeed in depositing a few eggs in the\n      cells; but from these eggs, as from those of the virgin mother, there\n      will, issue only males.",

                "Here we behold the active intervention of a superior though perhaps\n      imprudent will, which offers irresistible obstruction to the intelligent\n      will of a life. In the insect world such interventions are comparatively\n      frequent, and much can be gained from their study; for this world being\n      more densely peopled and more complex than others, certain special desires\n      of nature are often more palpably revealed to us there; and she may even\n      at times be detected in the midst of experiments we might almost be\n      warranted in regarding as incomplete. She has one great and general\n      desire, for instance, that she displays on all sides; the amelioration of\n      each species through the triumph of the stronger. This struggle, as a\n      rule, is most carefully organised. The hecatomb of the weak is enormous,\n      but that matters little so long as the victors' reward be effectual and\n      certain. But there are cases when one might almost imagine that nature had\n      not had time enough to disentangle her combinations; cases where reward is\n      impossible, and the fate of the victor no less disastrous than that of the\n      vanquished. And of such, selecting an instance that will not take us too\n      far from our bees, I know of no instance more striking than that of the\n      triongulins of the Sitaris colletes. And it will be seen that, in\n      many details, this story is less foreign to the history of man than might\n      perhaps be imagined.",
                "These triongulins are the primary larvae of a parasite proper to a wild,\n      obtuse-tongued, solitary bee, the Colletes, which builds its nest in\n      subterranean galleries. It is their habit to lie in wait for the bee at\n      the approach to these galleries; and then, to the number of three, four,\n      five, or often of more, they will leap on her back, and bury themselves in\n      her hair. Were the struggle of the weak against the strong to take place\n      at this moment there would be no more to be said, and all would pass in\n      accordance with universal law. But, for a reason we know not, their\n      instinct requires, and nature has consequently ordained, that they should\n      hold themselves tranquil so long as they remain on the back of the bee.\n      They patiently bide their time while she visits the flowers, and\n      constructs and provisions her cells. But no sooner has an egg been laid\n      than they all spring upon it; and the innocent colletes carefully seals\n      down her cell, which she has duly supplied with food, never suspecting\n      that she has at the same time ensured the death of her offspring.",
                "The cell has scarcely been closed when the triongulins grouped round the\n      egg engage in the inevitable and salutary combat of natural selection. The\n      stronger, more agile, will seize its adversary beneath the cuirass, and,\n      raising it aloft, will maintain it for hours in its mandibles until the\n      victim expire. But, while this fight is in progress, another of the\n      triongulins, that had either no rival to meet, or already has conquered,\n      takes possession of the egg and bursts it open. The ultimate victor has\n      therefore this fresh enemy to subdue; but the conquest is easy, for the\n      triongulin, deep in the satisfaction of its pre-natal hunger, clings\n      obstinately to the egg, and does not even attempt to defend itself. It is\n      quickly despatched; and the other is at last alone, and possessor of the\n      precious egg it has won so well. It eagerly plunges its head into the\n      opening its predecessor had made; and begins the lengthy repast that shall\n      transform it into a perfect insect. But nature, that has decreed this\n      ordeal of battle, has, on the other hand, established the prize of victory\n      with such miserly precision that nothing short of an entire egg will\n      suffice for the nourishment of a single triongulin. So that, as we are\n      informed by M. Mayet, to whom we owe the account of these disconcerting\n      adventures, there is lacking to our conqueror the food its last victim\n      consumed before death; and incapable therefore of achieving the first\n      stage of its transformation, it dies in its turn, adhering to the skin of\n      the egg, or adding itself, in the sugary liquid, to the number of the\n      drowned.",

But,\n      through some strange inadvertence, the amelioration nature imposes\n      suppresses the life of even the fittest, and the Sitaris Colletes would\n      have long since disappeared had not chance, acting in opposition to the\n      desires of nature, permitted isolated individuals to escape from the\n      excellent and far-seeing law that ordains on all sides the triumph of the\n      stronger.",

J. Carter, the\n      celebrated microscopist, that the very lowest embryos, such as the\n      myxomycetes, manifest a will and desires and preferences; and that\n      infusoria, which apparently have no organism whatever, give evidence of a\n      certain cunning. The Amoebae, for instance, will patiently lie in wait for\n      the new-born Acinetes, as they leave the maternal ovary; being aware that\n      these must as yet be lacking their poisonous tentacles.

In the little circle, even, that our eyes embrace we are constantly\n      shown that what we regarded as nature's blunder close by was due to her\n      deeming it well to adjust the presumed inadvertence out yonder.

She has to discover the\n      honey and pollen that lurk in the labyrinths of the nectaries and in the\n      most secret recesses of the anthers. And yet her eyes and olfactory organs\n      are like the eyes and organs of the infirm, compared with those of the\n      male. Were the drones almost blind, had they only the most rudimentary\n      sense of smell, they scarcely would suffer. They have nothing to do, no\n      prey to hunt down; their food is brought to them ready prepared, and their\n      existence is spent in the obscurity of the hive, lapping honey from the\n      comb. But they are the agents of love; and the most enormous, most useless\n      gifts are flung with both hands into the abyss of the future. Out of a\n      thousand of them, one only, once in his life, will have to seek, in the\n      depths of the azure, the presence of the royal virgin. Out of a thousand\n      one only will have, for one instant, to follow in space the female who\n      desires not to escape. That suffices. The partial power flings open her\n      treasury, wildly, even deliriously. To every one of these unlikely lovers,\n      of whom nine hundred and ninety-nine will be put to death a few days after\n      the fatal nuptials of the thousandth, she has given thirteen thousand eyes\n      on each side of their head, while the worker has only six thousand.\n      According to Cheshire's calculations, she has provided each of their\n      antennae with thirty-seven thousand eight hundred olfactory cavities,\n      while the worker has only five thousand in both. There we have an instance\n      of the almost universal disproportion that exists between the gifts she\n      rains upon love and her niggardly doles to labour; between the favours she\n      accords to what shall, in an ecstasy, create new life, and the\n      indifference wherewith she regards what will patiently have to maintain\n      itself by toil. Whoever would seek faithfully to depict the character of\n      nature, in accordance with the traits we discover here, would design an\n      extraordinary figure, very foreign to our ideal, which nevertheless can\n      only emanate from her. But too many things are unknown to man for him to\n      essay such a portrait, wherein all would be deep shadow save one or two\n      points of flickering light.",

The\n      friend whom we meet, the woman who approaches and smiles, the love that\n      unlocks our heart, the death or sorrow that seals it, the September sky\n      above us, this superb and delightful garden, wherein we see, as in\n      Corneille's 'Psyche,' bowers of greenery resting on gilded statues, and\n      the flocks grazing yonder, with their shepherd asleep, and the last houses\n      of the village, and the sea between the trees, -- all these are raised\n      or degraded before they enter within us, are adorned or despoiled, in\n      accordance with the little signal this choice of ours makes to them. We\n      must learn to select from among these semblances of truth. I have spent my\n      own life in eager search for the smaller truths, the physical causes; and\n      now, at the end of my days, I begin to cherish, not what would lead me\n      from these, but what would precede them, and, above all, what would\n      somewhat surpass them.\" We had attained the summit of a plateau in the\n      \"pays de Caux,\" in Normandy, which is supple as an English park, but\n      natural and limitless. It is one of the rare spots on the globe where\n      nature reveals herself to us unfailingly wholesome and green. A little\n      further to the north the country is threatened with barrenness, a little\n      further to the south, it is fatigued and scorched by the sun. At the end\n      of a plain that ran down to the edge of the sea, some peasants were\n      erecting a stack of corn. \"Look,\" he said, \"seen from here, they are\n      beautiful. They are constructing that simple and yet so important thing,\n      which is above all else the happy and almost unvarying monument of human\n      life taking root -- a stack of corn. The distance, the air of the\n      evening, weave their joyous cries into a kind of song without words, which\n      replies to the noble song of the leaves as they whisper over our heads.\n      Above them the sky is magnificent; and one almost might fancy that\n      beneficent spirits, waving palm-trees of fire, had swept all the light\n      towards the stack, to give the workers more time. And the track of the\n      palms still remains in the sky. See the humble church by their side,\n      overlooking and watching them, in the midst of the rounded lime trees and\n      the grass of the homely graveyard, that faces its native ocean. They are\n      fitly erecting their monument of life underneath the monuments of their\n      dead, who made the same gestures and still are with them. Take in the\n      whole picture. There are no special, characteristic features, such as we\n      find in England, Provence, or Holland. It is the presentment, large and\n      ordinary enough to be symbolic, of a natural and happy life. Observe how\n      rhythmic human existence becomes in its useful moments. Look at the man\n      who is leading the horses, at that other who throws up the sheaves on his\n      fork, at the women bending over the corn, and the children at play. ...\n      They have not displaced a stone, or removed a spadeful of earth, to add to\n      the beauty of the scenery; nor do they take one step, plant a tree or a\n      flower, that is not necessary. All that we see is merely the involuntary\n      result of the effort that man puts forth to subsist for a moment in\n      nature; and yet those among us whose desire is only to create or imagine\n      spectacles of peace, deep thoughtfulness, or beatitude, have been able to\n      find no scene more perfect than this, which indeed they paint or describe\n      whenever they seek to present us with a picture of beauty or happiness.\n      Here we have the first semblance, which some will call the truth.\"",
                "{92}",
                "\"Let us draw nearer. Can you distinguish the song that blended so well\n      with the whispering of the leaves? It is made up of abuse and insult; and\n      when laughter bursts forth, it is due to an obscene remark some man or\n      woman has made, to a jest at the expense of the weaker, -- of the\n      hunchback unable to lift his load, the cripple they have knocked over, or\n      the idiot whom they make their butt.",
                "\"I have studied these people for many years. We are in Normandy; the soil\n      is rich and easily tilled. Around this stack of corn there is rather more\n      comfort than one would usually associate with a scene of this kind. The\n      result is that most of the men, and many of the women, are alcoholic.\n      Another poison also, which I need not name, corrodes the race. To that, to\n      the alcohol, are due the children whom you see there: the dwarf, the one\n      with the hare-lip, the others who are knock-kneed, scrofulous, imbecile.\n      All of them, men and women, young and old, have the ordinary vices of the\n      peasant. They are brutal, suspicious, grasping, and envious; hypocrites,\n      liars, and slanderers; inclined to petty, illicit profits, mean\n      interpretations, and coarse flattery of the stronger. Necessity brings\n      them together, and compels them to help each other; but the secret wish of\n      every individual is to harm his neighbour as soon as this can be done\n      without danger to himself. The one substantial pleasure of the village is\n      procured by the sorrows of others. Should a great disaster befall one of\n      them, it will long be the subject of secret, delighted comment among the\n      rest. Every man watches his fellow, is jealous of him, detests and\n      despises him. While they are poor, they hate their masters with a boiling\n      and pent-up hatred because of the harshness and avarice these last\n      display; should they in their turn have servants, they profit by their own\n      experience of servitude to reveal a harshness and avarice greater even\n      than that from which they have suffered. I could give you minutest details\n      of the meanness, deceit, injustice, tyranny, and malice that underlie this\n      picture of ethereal, peaceful toil. Do not imagine that the sight of this\n      marvellous sky, of the sea which spreads out yonder behind the church and\n      presents another, more sensitive sky, flowing over the earth like a great\n      mirror of wisdom and consciousness -- do not imagine that either sea or\n      sky is capable of lifting their thoughts or widening their minds. They\n      have never looked at them. Nothing has power to influence or move them\n      save three or four circumscribed fears, that of hunger, of force, of\n      opinion and law, and the terror of hell when they die. To show what they\n      are, we should have to consider them one by one. See that tall fellow\n      there on the right, who flings up such mighty sheaves. Last summer his\n      friends broke his right arm in some tavern row. I reduced the fracture,\n      which was a bad and compound one. I tended him for a long time, and gave\n      him the wherewithal to live till he should be able to get back to work. He\n      came to me every day. He profited by this to spread the report in the\n      village that he had discovered me in the arms of my sister-in-law, and\n      that my mother drank. He is not vicious, he bears me no ill-will; on the\n      contrary, see what a broad, open smile spreads over his face as he sees\n      me. It was not social animosity that induced him to slander me. The\n      peasant values wealth far too much to hate the rich man. But I fancy my\n      good corn-thrower there could not understand my tending him without any\n      profit to myself. He was satisfied that there must be some underhand\n      scheme, and he declined to be my dupe. More than one before him, richer or\n      poorer, has acted in similar fashion, if not worse. It did not occur to\n      him that he was lying when he spread those inventions abroad; he merely\n      obeyed a confused command of the morality he saw about him. He yielded\n      unconsciously, against his will, as it were, to the all-powerful desire of\n      the general malevolence.... But why complete a picture with which all are\n      familiar who have spent some years in the country? Here we have the second\n      semblance that some will call the real truth. It is the truth of practical\n      life. It undoubtedly is based on the most precise, the only, facts that\n      one can observe and test.\"",
                "{93}",
                "\"Let us sit on these sheaves,\" he continued, \"and look again. Let us\n      reject not a single one of the little facts that build up the reality of\n      which I have spoken. Let us permit them to depart of their own accord into\n      space. They cumber the foreground, and yet we cannot but be aware of the\n      existence behind them of a great and very curious force that sustains the\n      whole. Does it only sustain and not raise? These men whom we see before us\n      are at least no longer the ferocious animals of whom La Bruyere speaks,\n      the wretches who talked in a kind of inarticulate voice, and withdrew at\n      night to their dens, where they lived on black bread, water, and roots.",
                "\"The race, you will tell me, is neither as strong nor as healthy. That may\n      be; alcohol and the other scourge are accidents that humanity has to\n      surmount; ordeals, it may be, by which certain of our organs, those of the\n      nerves, for instance, may benefit; for we invariably find that life\n      profits by the ills that it overcomes. Besides, a mere trifle that we may\n      discover to-morrow may render these poisons innocuous. These men have\n      thoughts and feelings that those of whom La Bruyere speaks had not.\" \"I\n      prefer the simple, naked animal to the odious half-animal,\" I murmured.\n      \"You are thinking of the first semblance now,\" he replied, \"the semblance\n      dear to the poet, that we saw before; let us not confuse it with the one\n      we are now considering. These thoughts and feelings are petty, if you\n      will, and vile; but what is petty and vile is still better than that which\n      is not at all. Of these thoughts and feelings they avail themselves only\n      to hurt each other, and to persist in their present mediocrity; but thus\n      does it often happen in nature. The gifts she accords are employed for\n      evil at first, for the rendering worse what she had apparently sought to\n      improve; but, from this evil, a certain good will always result in the\n      end. Besides, I am by no means anxious to prove that there has been\n      progress, which may be a very small thing or a very great thing, according\n      to the place whence we regard it. It is a vast achievement, the surest\n      ideal, perhaps, to render the condition of men a little less servile, a\n      little less painful; but let the mind detach itself for an instant from\n      material results, and the difference between the man who marches in the\n      van of progress and the other who is blindly dragged at its tail ceases to\n      be very considerable. Among these young rustics, whose mind is haunted\n      only by formless ideas, there are many who have in themselves the\n      possibility of attaining, in a short space of time, the degree of\n      consciousness that we both enjoy. One is often struck by the narrowness of\n      the dividing line between what we regard as the unconsciousness of these\n      people and the consciousness that to us is the highest of all.\"",
                "\"Besides, of what is this consciousness composed, whereof we are so proud?\n      Of far more shadow than light, of far more acquired ignorance than\n      knowledge; of far more things whose comprehension, we are well aware, must\n      ever elude us, than of things that we actually know. And yet in this\n      consciousness lies all our dignity, our most veritable greatness; it is\n      probably the most surprising phenomenon this world contains. It is this\n      which permits us to raise our head before the unknown principle, and say\n      to it: 'What you are I know not; but there is something within me that\n      already enfolds you. You will destroy me, perhaps, but if your object be\n      not to construct from my ruins an organism better than mine, you will\n      prove yourself inferior to what I am; and the silence that will follow the\n      death of the race to which I belong will declare to you that you have been\n      judged. And if you are not capable even of caring whether you be justly\n      judged or not, of what value can your secret be? It must be stupid or\n      hideous. Chance has enabled you to produce a creature that you yourself\n      lacked the quality to produce. It is fortunate for him that a contrary\n      chance should have permitted you to suppress him before he had fathomed\n      the depths of your unconsciousness; more fortunate still that he does not\n      survive the infinite series of your awful experiments. He had nothing to\n      do in a world where his intellect corresponded to no eternal intellect,\n      where his desire for the better could attain no actual good.'",
                "\"Once more, for the spectacle to absorb us, there is no need of progress.\n      The enigma suffices; and that enigma is as great, and shines as\n      mysteriously, in the peasants as in ourselves. As we trace life back to\n      its all-powerful principle, it confronts us on every side. To this\n      principle each succeeding century has given a new name. Some of these\n      names were clear and consoling. It was found, however, that consolation\n      and clearness were alike illusory. But whether we call it God, Providence,\n      Nature, chance, life, fatality, spirit, or matter, the mystery remains\n      unaltered; and from the experience of thousands of years we have learned\n      nothing more than to give it a vaster name, one nearer to ourselves, more\n      congruous with our expectation, with the unforeseen.",
                "\"That is the name it bears to-day, wherefore it has never seemed greater.\n      Here we have one of the numberless aspects of the third semblance, which\n      also is truth.\""

These comport themselves in\n      the hive as did Penelope's suitors in the house of Ulysses. Indelicate and\n      wasteful, sleek and corpulent, fully content with their idle existence as\n      honorary lovers, they feast and carouse, throng the alleys, obstruct the\n      passages, and hinder the work; jostling and jostled, fatuously pompous,\n      swelled with foolish, good-natured contempt; harbouring never a suspicion\n      of the deep and calculating scorn wherewith the workers regard them, of\n      the constantly growing hatred to which they give rise, or of the destiny\n      that awaits them. For their pleasant slumbers they select the snuggest\n      corners of the hive; then, rising carelessly, they flock to the open cells\n      where the honey smells sweetest, and soil with their excrements the combs\n      they frequent. The patient workers, their eyes steadily fixed on the\n      future, will silently set things right. From noon till three, when the\n      purple country trembles in blissful lassitude beneath the invincible gaze\n      of a July or August sun, the drones will appear on the threshold. They\n      have a helmet made of enormous black pearls, two lofty, quivering plumes,\n      a doublet of iridescent, yellowish velvet, an heroic tuft, and a fourfold\n      mantle, translucent and rigid. They create a prodigious stir, brush the\n      sentry aside, overturn the cleaners, and collide with the foragers as\n      these return laden with their humble spoil. They have the busy air, the\n      extravagant, contemptuous gait, of indispensable gods who should be\n      simultaneously venturing towards some destiny unknown to the vulgar. One\n      by one they sail off into space, irresistible, glorious, and tranquilly\n      make for the nearest flowers, where they sleep till the afternoon\n      freshness awake them. Then, with the same majestic pomp, and still\n      overflowing with magnificent schemes, they return to the hive, go straight\n      to the cells, plunge their head to the neck in the vats of honey, and fill\n      themselves tight as a drum to repair their exhausted strength; whereupon,\n      with heavy steps, they go forth to meet the good, dreamless and careless\n      slumber that shall fold them in its embrace till the time for the next\n      repast.",

                "But the patience of the bees is not equal to that of men. One morning the\n      long-expected word of command goes through the hive; and the peaceful\n      workers turn into judges and executioners. Whence this word issues, we\n      know not; it would seem to emanate suddenly from the cold, deliberate\n      indignation of the workers; and no sooner has it been uttered than every\n      heart throbs with it, inspired with the genius of the unanimous republic.\n      One part of the people renounce their foraging duties to devote themselves\n      to the work of justice. The great idle drones, asleep in unconscious\n      groups on the melliferous walls, are rudely torn from their slumbers by an\n      army of wrathful virgins. They wake, in pious wonder; they cannot believe\n      their eyes; and their astonishment struggles through their sloth as a\n      moonbeam through marshy water. They stare amazedly round them, convinced\n      that they must be victims of some mistake; and the mother-idea of their\n      life being first to assert itself in their dull brain, they take a step\n      towards the vats of honey to seek comfort there. But ended for them are\n      the days of May honey, the wine-flower of lime trees and fragrant ambrosia\n      of thyme and sage, of marjoram and white clover. Where the path once lay\n      open to the kindly, abundant reservoirs, that so invitingly offered their\n      waxen and sugary mouths, there stands now a burning-bush all alive with\n      poisonous, bristling stings. The atmosphere of the city is changed; in\n      lieu of the friendly perfume of honey, the acrid odour of poison prevails;\n      thousands of tiny drops glisten at the end of the stings, and diffuse\n      rancour and hatred. Before the bewildered parasites are able to realise\n      that the happy laws of the city have crumbled, dragging down in most\n      inconceivable fashion their own plentiful destiny, each one is assailed by\n      three or four envoys of justice; and these vigorously proceed to cut off\n      his wings, saw through the petiole that connects the abdomen with the\n      thorax, amputate the feverish antennae, and seek an opening between the\n      rings of his cuirass through which to pass their sword. No defence is\n      attempted by the enormous, but unarmed, creatures; they try to escape, or\n      oppose their mere bulk to the blows that rain down upon them. Forced on to\n      their back, with their relentless enemies clinging doggedly to them, they\n      will use their powerful claws to shift them from side to side; or, turning\n      on themselves, they will drag the whole group round and round in wild\n      circles, which exhaustion soon brings to an end. And, in a very brief\n      space, their appearance becomes so deplorable that pity, never far from\n      justice in the depths of our heart, quickly returns, and would seek\n      forgiveness, though vainly, of the stern workers who recognise only\n      nature's harsh and profound laws. The wings of the wretched creatures are\n      torn, their antennae bitten, the segments of their legs wrenched off; and\n      their magnificent eyes, mirrors once of the exuberant flowers, flashing\n      back the blue light and the innocent pride of summer, now, softened by\n      suffering, reflect only the anguish and distress of their end. Some\n      succumb to their wounds, and are at once borne away to distant cemeteries\n      by two or three of their executioners. Others, whose injuries are less,\n      succeed in sheltering themselves in some corner, where they lie, all\n      huddled together, surrounded by an inexorable guard, until they perish of\n      want. Many will reach the door, and escape into space dragging their\n      adversaries with them; but, towards evening, impelled by hunger and cold,\n      they return in crowds to the entrance of the hive to beg for shelter. But\n      there they encounter another pitiless guard. The next morning, before\n      setting forth on their journey, the workers will clear the threshold,\n      strewn with the corpses of the useless giants; and all recollection of the\n      idle race disappear till the following spring.",

Inevitable misery\n      follows; and all the tribe -- mother, parasites, workers -- collect\n      in a hungry and closely intertwined group, who perish in silence before\n      the first snows arrive, in the obscurity of the hive.",

Building ceases, births diminish, deaths\n      multiply; the nights lengthen, and days grow shorter. Rain and inclement\n      winds, the mists of the morning, the ambushes laid by a hastening\n      twilight, carry off hundreds of workers who never return; and soon, over\n      the whole little people, that are as eager for sunshine as the\n      grasshoppers of Attica, there hangs the cold menace of winter.",
                "Man has already taken his share of the harvest. Every good hive has\n      presented him with eighty or a hundred pounds of honey; the most\n      remarkable will sometimes even give two hundred, which represent an\n      enormous expanse of liquefied light, immense fields of flowers that have\n      been visited daily one or two thousand times. He throws a last glance over\n      the colonies, which are becoming torpid. From the richest he takes their\n      superfluous wealth to distribute it among those whom misfortune, unmerited\n      always in this laborious world, may have rendered necessitous. He covers\n      the dwellings, half closes the doors, removes the useless frames, and\n      leaves the bees to their long winter sleep. They gather in the centre of\n      the hive, contract themselves, and cling to the combs that contain the\n      faithful urns; whence there shall issue, during days of frost, the\n      transmuted substance of summer. The queen is in the midst of them,\n      surrounded by her guard. The first row of the workers attach themselves to\n      the sealed cells; a second row cover the first, a third the second, and so\n      in succession to the last row of all, which form the envelope. When the\n      bees of this envelope feel the cold stealing over them, they re-enter the\n      mass, and others take their place. The suspended cluster is like a sombre\n      sphere that the walls of the comb divide; it rises imperceptibly and\n      falls, it advances or retires, in proportion as the cells grow empty to\n      which it clings. For, contrary to what is generally believed, the winter\n      life of the bee is not arrested, although it be slackened. By the\n      concerted beating of their wings -- little sisters that have survived\n      the flames of the sun -- which go quickly or slowly in accordance as\n      the temperature without may vary, they maintain in their sphere an\n      unvarying warmth, equal to that of a day in spring. This secret spring\n      comes from the beautiful honey, itself but a ray of heat transformed, that\n      returns now to its first condition. It circulates in the hive like\n      generous blood. The bees at the full cells present it to their neighbours,\n      who pass it on in their turn. Thus it goes from hand to hand and from\n      mouth to mouth, till it attain the extremity of the group in whose\n      thousands of hearts one destiny, one thought, is scattered and united. It\n      stands in lieu of the sun and the flowers, till its elder brother, the\n      veritable sun of the real, great spring, peering through the half-open\n      door, glides in his first softened glances, wherein anemones and violets\n      are coming to life again; and gently awakens the workers, showing them\n      that the sky once more is blue in the world, and that the uninterrupted\n      circle that joins death to life has turned and begun afresh."

Yes, they will say, that is all very wonderful; but then, it has\n      never been otherwise. The bees have for thousands of years dwelt under\n      remarkable laws, but during those thousands of years the laws have not\n      varied. For thousands of years they have constructed their marvellous\n      combs, whereto we can add nothing, wherefrom we can take nothing, -- combs\n      that unite in equal perfection the science of the chemist, the\n      geometrician, the architect, and the engineer; but on the sarcophagi, on\n      Egyptian stones and papyri, we find drawings of combs that are identical\n      in every particular. Name a single fact that will show the least progress,\n      a single instance of their having contrived some new feature or modified\n      their habitual routine, and we will cheerfully yield, and admit that they\n      not only possess an admirable instinct, but have also an intellect worthy\n      to approach that of man, worthy to share in one knows not what higher\n      destiny than awaits unconscious and submissive matter.",
                "This language is not even confined to the profane; it is made use of by\n      entomologists of the rank of Kirby and Spence, in order to deny the bees\n      the possession of intellect other than may vaguely stir within the narrow\n      prison of an extraordinary but unchanging instinct. \"Show us,\" they say,\n      \"a single case where the pressure of events has inspired them with the\n      idea, for instance, of substituting clay or mortar for wax or propolis;\n      show us this, and we will admit their capacity for reasoning.\"",
                "This argument, that Romanes refers to as the \"question-begging argument,\"\n      and that might also be termed the \"insatiable argument,\" is exceedingly\n      dangerous, and, if applied to man, would take us very far. Examine it\n      closely, and you find that it emanates from the \"mere common-sense,\" which\n      is often so harmful; the \"common-sense\" that replied to Galileo: \"The\n      earth does not turn, for I can see the sun move in the sky, rise in the\n      morning and sink in the evening; and nothing can prevail over the\n      testimony of my eyes.\" Common-sense makes an admirable, and necessary,\n      background for the mind; but unless it be watched by a lofty disquiet ever\n      ready to remind it, when occasion demand, of the infinity of its\n      ignorance, it dwindles into the mere routine of the baser side of our\n      intellect. But the bees have themselves answered the objection Messrs.\n      Kirby and Spence advanced. Scarcely had it been formulated when another\n      naturalist, Andrew Knight, having covered the bark of some diseased trees\n      with a kind of cement made of turpentine and wax, discovered that his bees\n      were entirely renouncing the collection of propolis, and exclusively using\n      this unknown matter, which they had quickly tested and adopted, and found\n      in abundant quantities, ready prepared, in the vicinity of their dwelling.",
                "And indeed, one-half of the science and practice of apiculture consists in\n      giving free rein to the spirit of initiative possessed by the bees, and in\n      providing their enterprising intellect with opportunities for veritable\n      discoveries and veritable inventions. Thus, for instance, to aid in the\n      rearing of the larvae and nymphs, the bee-keeper will scatter a certain\n      quantity of flour close to the hive when the pollen is scarce of which\n      these consume an enormous quantity. In a state of nature, in the heart of\n      their native forests in the Asiatic valleys, where they existed probably\n      long before the tertiary epoch, the bees can evidently never have met with\n      a substance of this kind. And yet, if care be taken to \"bait\" some of them\n      with it, by placing them on the flour, they will touch it and test it,\n      they will perceive that its properties more or less resemble those\n      possessed by the dust of the anthers; they will spread the news among\n      their sisters, and we shall soon find every forager hastening to this\n      unexpected, incomprehensible food, which, in their hereditary memory, must\n      be inseparable from the calyx of flowers where their flight, for so many\n      centuries past, has been sumptuously and voluptuously welcomed.",

                "It is a little more than a hundred years ago that Huber's researches gave\n      the first serious impetus to our study of the bees, and revealed the\n      elementary important truths that allowed us to observe them with fruitful\n      result. Barely fifty years have passed since the foundation of rational,\n      practical apiculture was rendered possible by means of the movable combs\n      and frames devised by Dzierzon and Langstroth, and the hive ceased to be\n      the inviolable abode wherein all came to pass in a mystery from which\n      death alone stripped the veil. And lastly, less than fifty years have\n      elapsed since the improvements of the microscope, of the entomologist's\n      laboratory, revealed the precise secret of the principal organs of the\n      workers, of the mother, and the males. Need we wonder if our knowledge be\n      as scanty as our experience? The bees have existed many thousands of\n      years; we have watched them for ten or twelve lustres. And if it could\n      even be proved that no change has occurred in the hive since we first\n      opened it, should we have the right to conclude that nothing had changed\n      before our first questioning glance? Do we not know that in the evolution\n      of species a century is but as a drop of rain that is caught in the whirl\n      of the river, and that millenaries glide as swiftly over the life of\n      universal matter as single years over the history of a people?",

But for the moment we will limit ourselves to our domestic bee\n      properly so called. Of these sixteen fairly distinct species are known;\n      but, essentially, whether we consider the Apis Dorsata, the largest known\n      to us, or the Apis Florea, which is the smallest, the insect is always\n      exactly the same, except for the slight modifications induced by the\n      climate and by the conditions whereto it has had to conform.*",

In a state of nature, however, in an ideal\n      climate, this is not the case. If they listened only to their essential\n      instinct, they would construct their combs in the open air. In the Indies,\n      the Apis Dorsata will not eagerly seek hollow trees, or a hole in the\n      rocks. The swarm will hang from the crook of a branch; and the comb will\n      be lengthened, the queen lay her eggs, provisions be stored, with no\n      shelter other than that which the workers' own bodies provide. Our\n      Northern bees have at times been known to revert to this instinct, under\n      the deceptive influence of a too gentle sky; and swarms have been found\n      living in the heart of a bush. But even in the Indies, the result of this\n      habit, which would seem innate, is by no means favourable. So considerable\n      a number of the workers are compelled to remain on one spot, occupied\n      solely with the maintenance of the heat required by those who are moulding\n      the wax and rearing the brood, that the Apis Dorsata, hanging thus from\n      the branches, will construct but a single comb; whereas if she have the\n      least shelter she will erect four or five, or more, and will\n      proportionately increase the prosperity and the population of the colony.\n      And indeed we find that all species of bees existing in cold and temperate\n      regions have abandoned this primitive method. The intelligent initiative\n      of the insect has evidently received the sanction of natural selection,\n      which has allowed only the most numerous and best protected tribes to\n      survive our winters. What had been merely an idea, therefore, and opposed\n      to instinct, has thus by slow degrees become an instinctive habit. But it\n      is none the less true that in forsaking the vast light of nature that was\n      so dear to them and seeking shelter in the obscure hollow of a tree or a\n      cavern, the bees have followed what at first was an audacious idea, based\n      on observation, probably, on experience and reasoning.

We have already mentioned the intelligent\n      substitution of flour for pollen, and of an artificial cement for\n      propolis. We have seen with what skill the bees are able to adapt to their\n      needs the occasionally disconcerting dwellings into which they are\n      introduced, and the surprising adroitness wherewith they turn combs of\n      foundation-wax to good account. They display extraordinary ingenuity in\n      their manner of handling these marvellous combs, which are so strangely\n      useful, and yet incomplete. In point of fact, they meet man half-way. Let\n      us imagine that we had for centuries past been erecting cities, not with\n      stones, bricks, and lime, but with some pliable substance painfully\n      secreted by special organs of our body. One day an all-powerful being\n      places us in the midst of a fabulous city.

Our habitual plan is there; in fact, we find everything that\n      we had expected; but all has been put together by some antecedent force\n      that would seem to have crushed it, arrested it in the mould, and to have\n      hindered its completion. The houses whose height must attain some four or\n      five yards are the merest protuberances, that our two hands can cover.\n      Thousands of walls are indicated by signs that hint at once of their plan\n      and material. Elsewhere there are marked deviations, which must be\n      corrected; gaps to be filled and harmoniously joined to the rest, vast\n      surfaces that are unstable and will need support. The enterprise is\n      hopeful, but full of hardship and danger. It would seem to have been\n      conceived by some sovereign intelligence, that was able to divine most of\n      our desires, but has executed them clumsily, being hampered by its very\n      vastness. We must disentangle, therefore, what now is obscure, we must\n      develop the least intentions of the supernatural donor; we must build in a\n      few days what would ordinarily take us years; we must renounce organic\n      habits, and fundamentally alter our methods of labour. It is certain that\n      all the attention man could devote would not be excessive for the solution\n      of the problems that would arise, or for the turning to fullest account\n      the help thus offered by a magnificent providence.

I shall not dwell on their various methods of treating the queens,\n      or the laws as to swarming that are peculiar to the inhabitants of every\n      hive, and apparently transmitted from generation to generation, etc.; but\n      by the side of these facts which are not sufficiently established are\n      others so precise and unvarying as to prove that the same degree of\n      political civilisation has not been attained by all races of the domestic\n      bee, and that, among some of them, the public spirit still is groping its\n      way, seeking perhaps another solution of the royal problem. The Syrian\n      bee, for instance, habitually rears 120 queens and often more, whereas our\n      Apis Mellifica will rear ten or twelve at most. Cheshire tells of a Syrian\n      hive, in no way abnormal, where 120 dead queen-mothers were found, and 90\n      living, unmolested queens. This may be the point of departure, or the\n      point of arrival, of a strange social evolution, which it would be\n      interesting to study more thoroughly. We may add that as far as the\n      rearing of queens is concerned, the Cyprian bee approximates to the\n      Syrian. And finally, there is yet another fact which establishes still\n      more clearly that the customs and prudent organisation of the hive are not\n      the results of a primitive impulse, mechanically followed through\n      different ages and climates, but that the spirit which governs the little\n      republic is fully as capable of taking note of new conditions and turning\n      these to the best advantage, as in times long past it was capable of\n      meeting the dangers that hemmed it around. Transport our black bee to\n      California or Australia, and her habits will completely alter. Finding\n      that summer is perpetual and flowers forever abundant, she will after one\n      or two years be content to live from day to day, and gather sufficient\n      honey and pollen for the day's consumption; and, her thoughtful\n      observation of these new features triumphing over hereditary experience,\n      she will cease to make provision for the winter.* In fact it becomes\n      necessary, in order to stimulate her activity, to deprive her\n      systematically of the fruits of her labour.",

There can be no certainty, and yet many\n      instances invite us to believe that, were an actual estimate possible, the\n      quantity of matter that has raised itself from its beginnings would be\n      found to be ever increasing. A fragile remark, I admit, but the only one\n      we can make on the hidden force that leads us; and it stands for much in a\n      world where confidence in life, until certitude to the contrary reach us,\n      must remain the first of all our duties, at times even when life itself\n      conveys no encouraging clearness to us.",

The chances are that it will be false; but so long as we believe it\n      to be true it will serve a useful purpose by restoring our courage and\n      stimulating research in a new direction.

In the\n      meanwhile it would induce a state of stagnation within us more pernicious\n      than the most vexatious illusions.

A\n      certain number of her sisters, belonging to species already more skilful\n      and better supplied with utensils, such as the well-clad Colletes, or the\n      marvellous cutter of rose-leaves, the Megachile Centuncularis, live in an\n      isolation no less profound; and if by chance some creature attach itself\n      to them, and share their dwelling, it will either be an enemy, or, more\n      often, a parasite.",
                "For the world of bees is peopled with phantoms stranger than our own; and\n      many a species will thus have a kind of mysterious and inactive double,\n      exactly similar to the victim it has selected, save only that its\n      immemorial idleness has caused it to lose one by one its implements of\n      labour, and that it exists solely at the expense of the working type of\n      its race.*",
                "*The humble-bees, for instance, have the Psithyri as\n     parasites, while the Stelites live on the Anthidia. \"As\n     regards the frequent identity of the parasite with its\n     victim,\" M. J. Perez very justly remarks in his book \"The\n     Bees,\" \"one must necessarily admit that the two genera are\n     only different forms of the same type, and are united to\n     each other by the closest affinity. And to naturalists who\n     believe in the theory of evolution this relationship is not\n     purely ideal, but real. The parasitic genus must be regarded\n     as merely a branch of the foraging genus, having lost its\n     foraging organs because of its adaptation to parasitic\n     life.\"",
                "Among the bees, however, which are somewhat too arbitrarily termed the\n      \"solitary Apidae,\" the social instinct already is smouldering, like a\n      flame crushed beneath the overwhelming weight of matter that stifles all\n      primitive life. And here and there, in unexpected directions, as though\n      reconnoitring, with timid and sometimes fantastic outbursts, it will\n      succeed in piercing the mass that oppresses it, the pyre that some day\n      shall feed its triumph.",

Transition is called for from a precarious, egotistic and\n      incomplete life to a life that shall be fraternal, a little more certain,\n      a little more happy. The spirit must ideally unite that which in the body\n      is actually separate; the individual must sacrifice himself for the race,\n      and substitute for visible things the things that cannot be seen. Need we\n      wonder that the bees do not at the first glance realise what we have not\n      yet disentangled, we who find ourselves at the privileged spot whence\n      instinct radiates from all sides into our consciousness? And it is curious\n      too, almost touching, to see how the new idea gropes its way, at first, in\n      the darkness that enfolds all things that come to life on this earth. It\n      emerges from matter, it is still quite material. It is cold, hunger, fear,\n      transformed into something that as yet has no shape. It crawls vaguely\n      around great dangers, around the long nights, the approach of winter, of\n      an equivocal sleep which almost is death....",

Towards the end of summer, however, some\n      individuals of a particular species, the Xylocopa Cyanescens, may be found\n      huddled together in a shivering group, on a stalk of asphodel, to spend\n      the winter in common. Among the Xylocopae this tardy fraternity is\n      exceptional, but among the Ceratinae, which are of their nearest kindred,\n      it has become a constant habit. The idea is germinating. It halts\n      immediately; and hitherto has not succeeded, among the Xylocopae, in\n      passing beyond this first obscure line of love.",
                "Among other Apiens, this groping idea assumes other forms. The\n      Chalicodomae of the out-houses, which are building-bees, the Dasypodae and\n      Halicti, which dig holes in the earth, unite in large colonies to\n      construct their nests. But it is an illusory crowd composed of solitary\n      units, that possess no mutual understanding, and do not act in common.\n      Each one is profoundly isolated in the midst of the multitude, and builds\n      a dwelling for itself alone, heedless of its neighbour. \"They are,\" M.\n      Perez remarks, \"a mere congregation of individuals, brought together by\n      similar tastes and habits, but observing scrupulously the maxim of each\n      one for itself; in fact, a mere mob of workers, resembling the swarm of a\n      hive only as regards their number and zeal. Such assemblies merely result\n      from a great number of individuals inhabiting the same locality.\"",
                "But when we come to the Panurgi, which are cousins of the Dasypodae, a\n      little ray of light suddenly reveals the birth of a new sentiment in this\n      fortuitous crowd. They collect in the same way as the others, and each one\n      digs its own subterranean chambers; but the entrance is common to all, as\n      also the gallery which leads from the surface of the ground to the\n      different cells. \"And thus,\" M. Perez adds, \"as far as the work of the\n      cells is concerned, each bee acts as though she were alone; but all make\n      equal use of the gallery that conducts to the cells, so that the multitude\n      profit by the labours of an individual, and are spared the time and\n      trouble required for the construction of separate galleries. It would be\n      interesting to discover whether this preliminary work be not executed in\n      common, by relays of females, relieving each other in turn.\"",
                "However this may be, the fraternal idea has pierced the wall that divided\n      two worlds. It is no longer wild and unrecognisable, wrested from instinct\n      by cold and hunger, or by the fear of death; it is prompted by active\n      life. But it halts once more; and in this instance arrives no further. No\n      matter, it does not lose courage; it will seek other channels. It enters\n      the humble-bee, and, maturing there, becomes embodied in a different\n      atmosphere, and works its first decisive miracles.",
                "The humble-bees, the great hairy, noisy creatures that all of us know so\n      well, so harmless for all their apparent fierceness, lead a solitary life\n      at first. At the beginning of March the impregnated female who has\n      survived the winter starts to construct her nest, either underground or in\n      a bush, according to the species to which she belongs. She is alone in the\n      world, in the midst of awakening spring. She chooses a spot, clears it,\n      digs it and carpets it. Then she erects her somewhat shapeless waxen\n      cells, stores these with honey and pollen, lays and hatches the eggs,\n      tends and nourishes the larvae that spring to life, and soon is surrounded\n      by a troop of daughters who aid her in all her labours, within the nest\n      and without, while some of them soon begin to lay in their turn. The\n      construction of the cells improves; the colony grows, the comfort\n      increases. The foundress is still its soul, its principal mother, and\n      finds herself now at the head of a kingdom which might be the model of\n      that of our honeybee. But the model is still in the rough.",
                "The prosperity of the humble-bees never exceeds a certain limit, their\n      laws are ill-defined and ill-obeyed, primitive cannibalism and infanticide\n      reappear at intervals, the architecture is shapeless and entails much\n      waste of material; but the cardinal difference between the two cities is\n      that the one is permanent, and the other ephemeral. For, indeed, that of\n      the humble-bee will perish in the autumn; its three or four hundred\n      inhabitants will die, leaving no trace of their passage or their\n      endeavours; and but a single female will survive, who, the next spring, in\n      the same solitude and poverty as her mother before her, will recommence\n      the same useless work. The idea, however, has now grown aware of its\n      strength. Among the humble-bees it goes no further than we have stated,\n      but, faithful to its habits and pursuing its usual routine, it will\n      immediately undergo a sort of unwearying metempsychosis, and re-incarnate\n      itself, trembling with its last triumph, rendered all-powerful now and\n      nearly perfect, in another group, the last but one of the race, that which\n      immediately precedes our domestic bee wherein it attains its crown; the\n      group of the Meliponitae, which comprises the tropical Meliponae and\n      Trigonae.",

The males, for instance, are not wholly idle; they secrete\n      wax. The entrance to the hive is more carefully guarded; it has a door\n      that can be closed when nights are cold, and when these are warm a kind of\n      curtain will admit the air.",
                "But the republic is less strong, general life less assured, prosperity\n      more limited, than with our bees; and wherever these are introduced, the\n      Meliponitae tend to disappear before them. In both races the fraternal\n      idea has undergone equal and magnificent development, save in one point\n      alone, wherein it achieves no further advance among the Meliponitae than\n      among the limited offspring of the humble-bees. In the mechanical\n      organisation of distributed labour, in the precise economy of effort;\n      briefly, in the architecture of the city, they display manifest\n      inferiority. As to this I need only refer to what I said in section 42 of\n      this book, while adding that, whereas in the hives of our Apitae all the\n      cells are equally available for the rearing of the brood and the storage\n      of provisions, and endure as long as the city itself, they serve only one\n      of these purposes among the Meliponitae, and the cells employed as cradles\n      for the nymphs are destroyed after these have been hatched.*",
                "*It is not certain that the principle of unique royalty, or\n     maternity, is strictly observed among the Meliponitae.\n     Blanchard remarks very justly, that as they possess no sting\n     and are consequently less readily able than the mothers of\n     our own bees to kill each other, several queens will\n     probably live together in the same hive. But certainty on\n     this point has hitherto been unattainable owing to the great\n     resemblance that exists between queens and workers, as also\n     to the impossibility of rearing the Meliponitae in our\n     climate.",
                "It is in our domestic bees, therefore, that the idea, of whose movements\n      we have given a cursory and incomplete picture, attains its most perfect\n      form. Are these movements definitely, and for all time, arrested in each\n      one of these species, and does the connecting-line exist in our\n      imagination alone? Let us not be too eager to establish a system in this\n      ill-explored region. Let our conclusions be only provisional, and\n      preferentially such as convey the utmost hope, for, were a choice forced\n      upon us, occasional gleams would appear to declare that the inferences we\n      are most desirous to draw will prove to be truest. Besides, let us not\n      forget that our ignorance still is profound. We are only learning to open\n      our eyes. A thousand experiments that could be made have as yet not even\n      been tried. If the Prosopes, for instance, were imprisoned, and forced to\n      cohabit with their kind, would they, in course of time, overstep the iron\n      barrier of total solitude, and be satisfied to live the common life of the\n      Dasypodae, or to put forth the fraternal effort of the Panurgi? And if we\n      imposed abnormal conditions upon the Panurgi, would these, in their turn,\n      progress from a general corridor to general cells? If the mothers of the\n      humble-bees were compelled to hibernate together, would they arrive at a\n      mutual understanding, a mutual division of labour? Have combs of\n      foundation-wax been offered to the Meliponitae? Would they accept them,\n      would they make use of them, would they conform their habits to this\n      unwonted architecture? Questions, these, that we put to Very tiny\n      creatures; and yet they contain the great word of our greatest secrets. We\n      cannot answer them, for our experience dates but from yesterday. Starting\n      with Reaumur, about a hundred and fifty years have elapsed since the\n      habits of wild bees first received attention. Reaumur was acquainted with\n      only a few of them; we have since then observed a few more; but hundreds,\n      thousands perhaps, have hitherto been noticed only by hasty and ignorant\n      travellers. The habits of those that are known to us have undergone no\n      change since the author of the \"Memoirs\" published his valuable work; and\n      the humble-bees, all powdered with gold, and vibrant as the sun's\n      delectable murmur, that in the year 1730 gorged themselves with honey in\n      the gardens of Charenton, were absolutely identical with those that\n      to-morrow, when April returns, will be humming in the woods of Vincennes,\n      but a few yards away. From Reaumur's day to our own, however, is but as\n      the twinkling of an eye; and many lives of men, placed end to end, form\n      but a second in the history of Nature's thought.",

                "Although the idea that our eyes have followed attains its supreme\n      expression in our domestic bees, it must not be inferred therefrom that\n      the hive reveals no faults. There is one masterpiece, the hexagonal cell,\n      that touches absolute perfection, -- a perfection that all the geniuses\n      in the world, were they to meet in conclave, could in no way enhance. No\n      living creature, not even man, has achieved, in the centre of his sphere,\n      what the bee has achieved in her own; and were some one from another world\n      to descend and ask of the earth the most perfect creation of the logic of\n      life, we should needs have to offer the humble comb of honey.",

We have\n      already dealt with a few faults and shortcomings, evident sometimes and\n      sometimes mysterious, such as the ruinous superabundance and idleness of\n      the males, parthenogenesis, the perils of the nuptial flight, excessive\n      swarming, the absence of pity, and the almost monstrous sacrifice of the\n      individual to society. To these must be added a strange inclination to\n      store enormous masses of pollen, far in excess of their needs; for the\n      pollen, soon turning rancid, and hardening, encumbers the surface of the\n      comb; and further, the long sterile interregnum between the date of the\n      first swarm and the impregnation of the second queen, etc., etc.",
                "Of these faults the gravest, the only one which in our climates is\n      invariably fatal, is the repeated swarming. But here we must bear in mind\n      that the natural selection of the domestic bee has for thousands of years\n      been thwarted by man. From the Egyptian of the time of Pharaoh to the\n      peasant of our own day, the bee-keeper has always acted in opposition to\n      the desires and advantages of the race. The most prosperous hives are\n      those which throw only one swarm after the beginning of summer. They have\n      fulfilled their maternal duties, assured the maintenance of the stock and\n      the necessary renewal of queens; they have guaranteed the future of the\n      swarm, which, being precocious and ample in numbers, has time to erect\n      solid and well-stored dwellings before the arrival of autumn. If left to\n      themselves, it is clear that these hives and their offshoots would have\n      been the only ones to survive the rigours of winter, which would almost\n      invariably have destroyed colonies animated by different instincts; and\n      the law of restricted swarming would therefore by slow degrees have\n      established itself in our northern races. But it is precisely these\n      prudent, opulent, acclimatised hives that man has always destroyed in\n      order to possess himself of their treasure. He has permitted only -- he\n      does so to this day in ordinary practice -- the feeblest colonies to\n      survive; degenerate stock, secondary or tertiary swarms, which have just\n      barely sufficient food to subsist through the winter, or whose miserable\n      store he will supplement perhaps with a few droppings of honey. The result\n      is, probably, that the race has grown feebler, that the tendency to\n      excessive swarming has been hereditarily developed, and that to-day almost\n      all our bees, particularly the black ones, swarm too often. For some years\n      now the new methods of \"movable\" apiculture have gone some way towards\n      correcting this dangerous habit; and when we reflect how rapidly\n      artificial selection acts on most of our domestic animals, such as oxen,\n      dogs, pigeons, sheep and horses, it is permissible to believe that we\n      shall before long have a race of bees that will entirely renounce natural\n      swarming and devote all their activity to the collection of honey and\n      pollen.",

And, among them, it is precisely those whose obedience to\n      duty is most complete who are able most fully to profit by the\n      supernatural intervention that to-day has raised the destiny of their\n      species. And indeed, to discover the unconquerable duty of a being is less\n      difficult than one imagines. It is ever to be read in the distinguishing\n      organs, whereto the others are all subordinate. And just as it is written\n      in the tongue, the stomach, and mouth of the bee that it must make honey,\n      so is it written in our eyes, our ears, our nerves, our marrow, in every\n      lobe of our head, that we must make cerebral substance; nor is there need\n      that we should divine the purpose this substance shall serve. The bees\n      know not whether they will eat the honey they harvest, as we know not who\n      it is shall reap the profit of the cerebral substance we shall have\n      formed, or of the intelligent fluid that issues therefrom and spreads over\n      the universe, perishing when our life ceases or persisting after our\n      death. As they go from flower to flower collecting more honey than\n      themselves and their offspring can need, let us go from reality to reality\n      seeking food for the incomprehensible flame, and thus, certain of having\n      fulfilled our organic duty, preparing ourselves for whatever befall. Let\n      us nourish this flame on our feelings and passions, on all that we see and\n      think, that we hear and touch, on its own essence, which is the idea it\n      derives from the discoveries, experience and observation that result from\n      its every movement. A time then will come when all things will turn so\n      naturally to good in a spirit that has given itself to the loyal desire of\n      this simple human duty, that the very suspicion of the possible\n      aimlessness of its exhausting effort will only render the duty the\n      clearer, will only add more purity, power, disinterestedness, and freedom\n      to the ardour wherewith it still seeks."
