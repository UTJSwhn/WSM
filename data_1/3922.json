                "She gave a glance at the armchairs placed before the chimney, at the\n      tea-table, which shone in the shade, and at the tall, pale stems of\n      flowers ascending above Chinese vases. She thrust her hand among the\n      flowery branches of the guelder roses to make their silvery balls quiver.\n      Then she looked at herself in a mirror with serious attention. She held\n      herself sidewise, her neck turned over her shoulder, to follow with her\n      eyes the spring of her fine form in its sheath-like black satin gown,\n      around which floated a light tunic studded with pearls wherein sombre\n      lights scintillated. She went nearer, curious to know her face of that\n      day. The mirror returned her look with tranquillity, as if this amiable\n      woman whom she examined, and who was not unpleasing to her, lived without\n      either acute joy or profound sadness.",
                "On the walls of the large drawing-room, empty and silent, the figures of\n      the tapestries, vague as shadows, showed pallid among their antique games\n      and dying graces. Like them, the terra-cotta statuettes on slender\n      columns, the groups of old Saxony, and the paintings of Sevres, spoke of\n      past glories. On a pedestal ornamented with precious bronzes, the marble\n      bust of some princess royal disguised as Diana appeared about to fly out\n      of her turbulent drapery, while on the ceiling a figure of Night, powdered\n      like a marquise and surrounded by cupids, sowed flowers. Everything was\n      asleep, and only the crackling of the logs and the light rattle of\n      Therese's pearls could be heard.",
                "Turning from the mirror, she lifted the corner of a curtain and saw\n      through the window, beyond the dark trees of the quay, the Seine spreading\n      its yellow reflections. Weariness of the sky and of the water was\n      reflected in her fine gray eyes. The boat passed, the 'Hirondelle',\n      emerging from an arch of the Alma Bridge, and carrying humble travellers\n      toward Grenelle and Billancourt. She followed it with her eyes, then let\n      the curtain fall, and, seating herself under the flowers, took a book from\n      the table. On the straw-colored linen cover shone the title in gold:\n      'Yseult la Blonde', by Vivian Bell. It was a collection of French verses\n      composed by an Englishwoman, and printed in London. She read\n      indifferently, waiting for visitors, and thinking less of the poetry than\n      of the poetess, Miss Bell, who was perhaps her most agreeable friend, and\n      whom she almost never saw; who, at every one of their meetings, which were\n      so rare, kissed her, calling her \"darling,\" and babbled; who, plain yet\n      seductive, almost ridiculous, yet wholly exquisite, lived at Fiesole like\n      a philosopher, while England celebrated her as her most beloved poet. Like\n      Vernon Lee and like Mary Robinson, she had fallen in love with the life\n      and art of Tuscany; and, without even finishing her Tristan, the first\n      part of which had inspired in Burne-Jones dreamy aquarelles, she wrote\n      Provencal verses and French poems expressing Italian ideas. She had sent\n      her 'Yseult la Blonde' to \"Darling,\" with a letter inviting her to spend a\n      month with her at Fiesole. She had written: \"Come; you will see the most\n      beautiful things in the world, and you will embellish them.\"",
                "And \"darling\" was saying to herself that she would not go, that she must\n      remain in Paris. But the idea of seeing Miss Bell in Italy was not\n      indifferent to her. And turning the leaves of the book, she stopped by\n      chance at this line:",
                "Love and gentle heart are one.",
                "And she asked herself, with gentle irony, whether Miss Bell had ever been\n      in love, and what manner of man could be the ideal of Miss Bell. The\n      poetess had at Fiesole an escort, Prince Albertinelli. He was very\n      handsome, but rather coarse and vulgar; too much so to please an aesthete\n      who blended with the desire for love the mysticism of an Annunciation.",
                "\"Good-evening, Therese. I am positively worn out.\"",
                "The Princess Seniavine had entered, supple in her furs, which almost\n      seemed to form a part of her dark beauty. She seated herself brusquely,\n      and, in a voice at once harsh yet caressing, said:",
                "\"This morning I walked through the park with General Lariviere. I met him\n      in an alley and made him go with me to the bridge, where he wished to buy\n      from the guardian a learned magpie which performs the manual of arms with\n      a gun. Oh! I am so tired!\"",
                "\"But why did you drag the General to the bridge?\"",

                "Preceded by the sound of his powerful breathing, General Lariviere\n      approached with heavy state and sat between the two women, looking\n      stubborn and self-satisfied, laughing in every wrinkle of his face.",
                "\"How is Monsieur Martin-Belleme? Always busy?\"",
                "Therese thought he was at the Chamber, and even that he was making a\n      speech there.",
                "Princess Seniavine, who was eating caviare sandwiches, asked Madame Martin\n      why she had not gone to Madame Meillan's the day before. They had played a\n      comedy there.",
                "\"A Scandinavian play? Was it a success?\"",
                "\"Yes -- I don't know. I was in the little green room, under the\n      portrait of the Duc d'Orleans. Monsieur Le Menil came to me and did me one\n      of those good turns that one never forgets. He saved me from Monsieur\n      Garain.\"",
                "The General, who knew the Annual Register, and stored away all useful\n      information, pricked up his ears.",

                "\"Himself. I was excessively agreeable to him. He talked to me of the\n      yearnings of his heart and he looked at me with alarming tenderness. And\n      from time to time he gazed, with sighs, at the portrait of the Duc\n      d'Orleans. I said to him: 'Monsieur Garain, you are making a mistake. It\n      is my sister-in-law who is an Orleanist. I am not.' At this moment\n      Monsieur Le Menil came to escort me to the buffet. He paid great\n      compliments -- to my horses! He said, also, there was nothing so\n      beautiful as the forest in winter. He talked about wolves. That refreshed\n      me.\"",
                "The General, who did not like young men, said he had met Le Menil the day\n      before in the forest, galloping, with vast space between himself and his\n      saddle.",
                "He declared that old cavaliers alone retained the traditions of good\n      horsemanship; that people in society now rode like jockeys.",
                "\"It is the same with fencing,\" he added. \"Formerly -- \"",
                "Princess Seniavine interrupted him:",
                "\"General, look and see how charming Madame Martin is. She is always\n      charming, but at this moment she is prettier than ever. It is because she\n      is bored. Nothing becomes her better than to be bored. Since we have been\n      here, we have bored her terribly. Look at her: her forehead clouded, her\n      glance vague, her mouth dolorous. Behold a victim!\"",
                "She arose, kissed Therese tumultuously, and fled, leaving the General\n      astonished.",
                "Madame Martin-Belleme prayed him not to listen to what the Princess had\n      said.",
                "He collected himself and asked:",
                "\"And how are your poets, Madame?\"",
                "It was difficult for him to forgive Madame Martin her preference for\n      people who lived by writing and were not of his circle.",

                "\"My poets? They forget me, they abandon me. One should not rely on\n      anybody. Men and women -- nothing is sure. Life is a continual\n      betrayal. Only that poor Miss Bell does not forget me. She has written to\n      me from Florence and sent her book.\"",

                "He reflected, and expressed the opinion that she must be at least thirty.",
                "An old lady, wearing with modest dignity her crown of white hair, and a\n      little vivacious man with shrewd eyes, came in suddenly -- Madame\n      Marmet and M. Paul Vence. Then, carrying himself very stiffly, with a\n      square monocle in his eye, appeared M. Daniel Salomon, the arbiter of\n      elegance. The General hurried out.",
                "They talked of the novel of the week. Madame Marmet had dined often with\n      the author, a young and very amiable man. Paul Vence thought the book\n      tiresome.",
                "\"Oh,\" sighed Madame Martin, \"all books are tiresome. But men are more\n      tiresome than books, and they are more exacting.\"",
                "Madame Marmet said that her husband, who had much literary taste, had\n      retained, until the end of his days, a horror of naturalism. She was the\n      widow of a member of the 'Academie des Inscriptions', and plumed herself\n      upon her illustrious widowhood. She was sweet and modest in her black gown\n      and her beautiful white hair.",
                "Madame Martin said to M. Daniel Salomon that she wished to consult him\n      particularly on the picture of a group of beautiful children.",
                "\"You will tell me if it pleases you. You may also give me your opinion,\n      Monsieur Vence, unless you disdain such trifles.\"",
                "M. Daniel Salomon looked at Paul Vence through his monocle with disdain.\n      Paul Vence surveyed the drawing-room.",
                "\"You have beautiful things, Madame. That would be nothing. But you have\n      only beautiful things, and all serve to set off your own beauty.\"",
                "She did not conceal her pleasure at hearing him speak in that way. She\n      regarded Paul Vence as the only really intelligent man she knew. She had\n      appreciated him before his books had made him celebrated. His ill-health,\n      his dark humor, his assiduous labor, separated him from society. The\n      little bilious man was not very pleasing; yet he attracted her. She held\n      in high esteem his profound irony, his great pride, his talent ripened in\n      solitude, and she admired him, with reason, as an excellent writer, the\n      author of powerful essays on art and on life.",
                "Little by little the room filled with a brilliant crowd. Within the large\n      circle of armchairs were Madame de Wesson, about whom people told\n      frightful stories, and who kept, after twenty years of half-smothered\n      scandal, the eyes of a child and cheeks of virginal smoothness; old Madame\n      de Morlaine, who shouted her witty phrases in piercing cries; Madame\n      Raymond, the wife of the Academician; Madame Garain, the wife of the\n      exminister; three other ladies; and, standing easily against the\n      mantelpiece, M. Berthier d'Eyzelles, editor of the 'Journal des Debats', a\n      deputy who caressed his white beard while Madame de Morlaine shouted at\n      him:",

                "\"He, nothing. His wife, everything.\"",

                "\"Your sculptor? When you wish. I saw at the Champ de Mars medallions made\n      by him which are very good. But he does not work much. He is an amateur,\n      is he not?\"",

He knows and he feels. He would be a master if he did not\n      live alone. I have known him since his childhood. People think that he is\n      solitary and morose. He is passionate and timid. What he lacks, what he\n      will lack always to reach the highest point of his art, is simplicity of\n      mind. He is restless, and he spoils his most beautiful impressions. In my\n      opinion he was created less for sculpture than for poetry or philosophy.\n      He knows a great deal, and you will be astonished at the wealth of his\n      mind.\"",
                "Madame Marmet approved.",
                "She pleased society by appearing to find pleasure in it. She listened a\n      great deal and talked little. Very affable, she gave value to her\n      affability by not squandering it. Either because she liked Madame Martin,\n      or because she knew how to give discreet marks of preference in every\n      house she went, she warmed herself contentedly, like a relative, in a\n      corner of the Louis XVI chimney, which suited her beauty. She lacked only\n      her dog.",
                "\"How is Toby?\" asked Madame Martin. \"Monsieur Vence, do you know Toby? He\n      has long silky hair and a lovely little black nose.\"",
                "Madame Marmet was relishing the praise of Toby, when an old man, pink and\n      blond, with curly hair, short-sighted, almost blind under his golden\n      spectacles, rather short, striking against the furniture, bowing to empty\n      armchairs, blundering into the mirrors, pushed his crooked nose before\n      Madame Marmet, who looked at him indignantly.",
                "It was M. Schmoll, member of the Academie des Inscriptions. He smiled and\n      turned a madrigal for the Countess Martin with that hereditary harsh,\n      coarse voice with which the Jews, his fathers, pressed their creditors,\n      the peasants of Alsace, of Poland, and of the Crimea. He dragged his\n      phrases heavily. This great philologist knew all languages except French.\n      And Madame Martin enjoyed his affable phrases, heavy and rusty like the\n      iron-work of brica-brac shops, among which fell dried leaves of anthology.\n      M. Schmoll liked poets and women, and had wit.",
                "Madame Marmet feigned not to know him, and went out without returning his\n      bow.",
                "When he had exhausted his pretty madrigals, M. Schmoll became sombre and\n      pitiful. He complained piteously. He was not decorated enough, not\n      provided with sinecures enough, nor well fed enough by the State -- he,\n      Madame Schmoll, and their five daughters. His lamentations had some\n      grandeur. Something of the soul of Ezekiel and of Jeremiah was in them.",
                "Unfortunately, turning his golden-spectacled eyes toward the table, he\n      discovered Vivian Bell's book.",
                "\"Oh, 'Yseult La Blonde',\" he exclaimed, bitterly. \"You are reading that\n      book, Madame? Well, learn that Mademoiselle Vivian Bell has stolen an\n      inscription from me, and that she has altered it, moreover, by putting it\n      into verse. You will find it on page 109 of her book: 'A shade may weep\n      over a shade.' You hear, Madame? 'A shade may weep over a shade.' Well,\n      those words are translated literally from a funeral inscription which I\n      was the first to publish and to illustrate. Last year, one day, when I was\n      dining at your house, being placed by the side of Mademoiselle Bell, I\n      quoted this phrase to her, and it pleased her a great deal. At her\n      request, the next day I translated into French the entire inscription and\n      sent it to her. And now I find it changed in this volume of verses under\n      this title: 'On the Sacred Way' -- the sacred way, that is I.\"",
                "And he repeated, in his bad humor:",
                "\"I, Madame, am the sacred way.\"",
                "He was annoyed that the poet had not spoken to him about this inscription.\n      He would have liked to see his name at the top of the poem, in the verses,\n      in the rhymes. He wished to see his name everywhere, and always looked for\n      it in the journals with which his pockets were stuffed. But he had no\n      rancor. He was not really angry with Miss Bell. He admitted gracefully\n      that she was a distinguished person, and a poet that did great honor to\n      England.",
                "When he had gone, the Countess Martin asked ingenuously of Paul Vence if\n      he knew why that good Madame Marmet had looked at M. Schmoll with such\n      marked though silent anger. He was surprised that she did not know.",
                "\"I never know anything,\" she said.",
                "\"But the quarrel between Schmoll and Marmet is famous. It ceased only at\n      the death of Marmet.",
                "\"The day that poor Marmet was buried, snow was falling. We were wet and\n      frozen to the bones. At the grave, in the wind, in the mud, Schmoll read\n      under his umbrella a speech full of jovial cruelty and triumphant pity,\n      which he took afterward to the newspapers in a mourning carriage. An\n      indiscreet friend let Madame Marmet hear of it, and she fainted. Is it\n      possible, Madame, that you have not heard of this learned and ferocious\n      quarrel?",
                "\"The Etruscan language was the cause of it. Marmet made it his unique\n      study. He was surnamed Marmet the Etruscan. Neither he nor any one else\n      knew a word of that language, the last vestige of which is lost. Schmoll\n      said continually to Marmet: 'You do not know Etruscan, my dear colleague;\n      that is the reason why you are an honorable savant and a fair-minded man.' \n      Piqued by his ironic praise, Marmet thought of learning a little Etruscan.\n      He read to his colleague a memoir on the part played by flexions in the\n      idiom of the ancient Tuscans.\"",
                "Madame Martin asked what a flexion was.",
                "\"Oh, Madame, if I explain anything to you, it will mix up everything. Be\n      content with knowing that in that memoir poor Marmet quoted Latin texts\n      and quoted them wrong.

                "\"He reproached his young colleague -- Marmet was not fifty years old -- with\n      reading Etruscan too well and Latin not well enough. From that time Marmet\n      had no rest. At every meeting he was mocked unmercifully; and, finally, in\n      spite of his softness, he got angry. Schmoll is without rancor. It is a\n      virtue of his race. He does not bear ill-will to those whom he persecutes.\n      One day, as he went up the stairway of the Institute with Renan and\n      Oppert, he met Marmet, and extended his hand to him. Marmet refused to\n      take it, and said 'I do not know you.' -- 'Do you take me for a Latin\n      inscription?' Schmoll replied. Marmet died and was buried because of that\n      satire. Now you know the reason why his widow sees his enemy with horror.\"",

                "He thanked her with a look. Then, placing himself on at the other side of\n      the chimney, he asked who was that Dechartre whom she wished introduced to\n      her.",

                "\"My friend, you can not complain of that. I did not even go to Madame\n      Meillan's yesterday.\"",
                "\"You are right to show yourself there as little as possible. It is not a\n      house for you.\"",
                "He explained. All the women that went there had had some spicy adventure\n      which was known and talked about. Besides, Madame Meillan favored\n      intrigue. He gave examples. Madame Martin, however, her hands extended on\n      the arms of the chair in charming restfulness, her head inclined, looked\n      at the dying embers in the grate. Her thoughtful mood had flown. Nothing\n      of it remained on her face, a little saddened, nor in her languid body,\n      more desirable than ever in the quiescence of her mind. She kept for a\n      while a profound immobility, which added to her personal attraction the\n      charm of things that art had created.",
                "He asked her of what she was thinking. Escaping the magic of the blaze in\n      the ashes, she said:",
                "\"We will go to-morrow, if you wish, to far distant places, to the odd\n      districts where the poor people live. I like the old streets where misery\n      dwells.\"",
                "He promised to satisfy her taste, although he let her know that he thought\n      it absurd. The walks that she led him sometimes bored him, and he thought\n      them dangerous. People might see them.",

                "She shook her head.",
                "\"Do you think that people have not talked about us? Whether they know or\n      do not know, they talk. Not everything is known, but everything is said.\"",
                "She relapsed into her dream. He thought her discontented, cross, for some\n      reason which she would not tell. He bent upon her beautiful, grave eyes\n      which reflected the light of the grate. But she reassured him.",
                "\"I do not know whether any one talks about me. And what do I care? Nothing\n      matters.\"",
                "He left her. He was going to dine at the club, where a friend was waiting\n      for him. She followed him with her eyes, with peaceful sympathy. Then she\n      began again to read in the ashes.",
                "She saw in them the days of her childhood; the castle wherein she had\n      passed the sweet, sad summers; the dark and humid park; the pond where\n      slept the green water; the marble nymphs under the chestnut-trees, and the\n      bench on which she had wept and desired death. To-day she still ignored\n      the cause of her youthful despair, when the ardent awakening of her\n      imagination threw her into a troubled maze of desires and of fears. When\n      she was a child, life frightened her. And now she knew that life is not\n      worth so much anxiety nor so much hope; that it is a very ordinary thing.\n      She should have known this. She thought:",
                "\"I saw mamma; she was good, very simple, and not very happy. I dreamed of\n      a destiny different from hers. Why? I felt around me the insipid taste of\n      life, and seemed to inhale the future like a salt and pungent aroma. Why?\n      What did I want, and what did I expect? Was I not warned enough of the\n      sadness of everything?\"",
                "She had been born rich, in the brilliancy of a fortune too new. She was a\n      daughter of that Montessuy, who, at first a clerk in a Parisian bank,\n      founded and governed two great establishments, brought to sustain them the\n      resources of a brilliant mind, invincible force of character, a rare\n      alliance of cleverness and honesty, and treated with the Government as if\n      he were a foreign power. She had grown up in the historical castle of\n      Joinville, bought, restored, and magnificently furnished by her father.\n      Montessuy made life give all it could yield. An instinctive and powerful\n      atheist, he wanted all the goods of this world and all the desirable\n      things that earth produces. He accumulated pictures by old masters, and\n      precious sculptures. At fifty he had known all the most beautiful women of\n      the stage, and many in society. He enjoyed everything worldly with the\n      brutality of his temperament and the shrewdness of his mind.",
                "Poor Madame Montessuy, economical and careful, languished at Joinville,\n      delicate and poor, under the frowns of twelve gigantic caryatides which\n      held a ceiling on which Lebrun had painted the Titans struck by Jupiter.\n      There, in the iron cot, placed at the foot of the large bed, she died one\n      night of sadness and exhaustion, never having loved anything on earth\n      except her husband and her little drawing-room in the Rue Maubeuge.",
                "She never had had any intimacy with her daughter, whom she felt\n      instinctively too different from herself, too free, too bold at heart; and\n      she divined in Therese, although she was sweet and good, the strong\n      Montessuy blood, the ardor which had made her suffer so much, and which\n      she forgave in her husband, but not in her daughter.",
                "But Montessuy recognized his daughter and loved her. Like most hearty,\n      full-blooded men, he had hours of charming gayety. Although he lived out\n      of his house a great deal, he breakfasted with her almost every day, and\n      sometimes took her out walking. He understood gowns and furbelows. He\n      instructed and formed Therese. He amused her. Near her, his instinct for\n      conquest inspired him still. He desired to win always, and he won his\n      daughter. He separated her from her mother. Therese admired him, she\n      adored him.",
                "In her dream she saw him as the unique joy of her childhood. She was\n      persuaded that no man in the world was as amiable as her father.",
                "At her entrance in life, she despaired at once of finding elsewhere so\n      rich a nature, such a plenitude of active and thinking forces. This\n      discouragement had followed her in the choice of a husband, and perhaps\n      later in a secret and freer choice.",
                "She had not really selected her husband. She did not know: she had\n      permitted herself to be married by her father, who, then a widower,\n      embarrassed by the care of a girl, had wished to do things quickly and\n      well. He considered the exterior advantages, estimated the eighty years of\n      imperial nobility which Count Martin brought. The idea never came to him\n      that she might wish to find love in marriage.",
                "He flattered himself that she would find in it the satisfaction of the\n      luxurious desires which he attributed to her, the joy of making a display\n      of grandeur, the vulgar pride, the material domination, which were for him\n      all the value of life, as he had no ideas on the subject of the happiness\n      of a true woman, although he was sure that his daughter would remain\n      virtuous.",
                "While thinking of his absurd yet natural faith in her, which accorded so\n      badly with his own experiences and ideas regarding women, she smiled with\n      melancholy irony. And she admired her father the more.",
                "After all, she was not so badly married. Her husband was as good as any\n      other man. He had become quite bearable. Of all that she read in the\n      ashes, in the veiled softness of the lamps, of all her reminiscences, that\n      of their married life was the most vague. She found a few isolated traits\n      of it, some absurd images, a fleeting and fastidious impression. The time\n      had not seemed long and had left nothing behind. Six years had passed, and\n      she did not even remember how she had regained her liberty, so prompt and\n      easy had been her conquest of that husband, cold, sickly, selfish, and\n      polite; of that man dried up and yellowed by business and politics,\n      laborious, ambitious, and commonplace. He liked women only through vanity,\n      and he never had loved his wife. The separation had been frank and\n      complete. And since then, strangers to each other, they felt a tacit,\n      mutual gratitude for their freedom. She would have had some affection for\n      him if she had not found him hypocritical and too subtle in the art of\n      obtaining her signature when he needed money for enterprises that were\n      more for ostentation than real benefit. The man with whom she dined and\n      talked every day had no significance for her.",
                "With her cheek in her hand, before the grate, as if she questioned a\n      sibyl, she saw again the face of the Marquis de Re. She saw it so\n      precisely that it surprised her. The Marquis de Re had been presented to\n      her by her father, who admired him, and he appeared to her grand and\n      dazzling for his thirty years of intimate triumphs and mundane glories.\n      His adventures followed him like a procession. He had captivated three\n      generations of women, and had left in the heart of all those whom he had\n      loved an imperishable memory. His virile grace, his quiet elegance, and\n      his habit of pleasing had prolonged his youth far beyond the ordinary term\n      of years. He noticed particularly the young Countess Martin. The homage of\n      this expert flattered her. She thought of him now with pleasure. He had a\n      marvellous art of conversation. He amused her. She let him see it, and at\n      once he promised to himself, in his heroic frivolity, to finish worthily\n      his happy life by the subjugation of this young woman whom he appreciated\n      above every one else, and who evidently admired him. He displayed, to\n      capture her, the most learned stratagems. But she escaped him very easily.",
                "She yielded, two years later, to Robert Le Menil, who had desired her\n      ardently, with all the warmth of his youth, with all the simplicity of his\n      mind. She said to herself: \"I gave myself to him because he loved me.\" It\n      was the truth. The truth was, also, that a dumb yet powerful instinct had\n      impelled her, and that she had obeyed the hidden impulse of her being. But\n      even this was not her real self; what awakened her nature at last was the\n      fact that she believed in the sincerity of his sentiment. She had yielded\n      as soon as she had felt that she was loved. She had given herself,\n      quickly, simply. He thought that she had yielded easily. He was mistaken.\n      She had felt the discouragement which the irreparable gives, and that sort\n      of shame which comes of having suddenly something to conceal. Everything\n      that had been whispered before her about other women resounded in her\n      burning ears. But, proud and delicate, she took care to hide the value of\n      the gift she was making. He never suspected her moral uneasiness, which\n      lasted only a few days, and was replaced by perfect tranquillity. After\n      three years she defended her conduct as innocent and natural.",
                "Having done harm to no one, she had no regrets. She was content. She was\n      in love, she was loved. Doubtless she had not felt the intoxication she\n      had expected, but does one ever feel it? She was the friend of the good\n      and honest fellow, much liked by women who passed for disdainful and hard\n      to please, and he had a true affection for her. The pleasure she gave him\n      and the joy of being beautiful for him attached her to this friend. He\n      made life for her not continually delightful, but easy to bear, and at\n      times agreeable.",
                "That which she had not divined in her solitude, notwithstanding vague\n      yearnings and apparently causeless sadness, he had revealed to her. She\n      knew herself when she knew him. It was a happy astonishment. Their\n      sympathies were not in their minds. Her inclination toward him was simple\n      and frank, and at this moment she found pleasure in the idea of meeting\n      him the next day in the little apartment where they had met for three\n      years. With a shake of the head and a shrug of her shoulders, coarser than\n      one would have expected from this exquisite woman, sitting alone by the\n      dying fire, she said to herself: \"There! I need love!\""

Robert Le Menil made a sign to a coachman, and entered\n      the carriage with Therese. Close together, they rolled among the vague\n      shadows, cut by sudden lights, through the ghostly city, having in their\n      minds only sweet and vanishing impressions while everything around them\n      seemed confused and fleeting.",
                "The carriage approached the Pont-Neuf. They stepped out. A dry cold made\n      vivid the sombre January weather. Under her veil Therese joyfully inhaled\n      the wind which swept on the hardened soil a dust white as salt. She was\n      glad to wander freely among unknown things. She liked to see the stony\n      landscape which the clearness of the air made distinct; to walk quickly\n      and firmly on the quay where the trees displayed the black tracery of\n      their branches on the horizon reddened by the smoke of the city; to look\n      at the Seine. In the sky the first stars appeared.",
                "\"One would think that the wind would put them out,\" she said.",
                "He observed, too, that they scintillated a great deal. He did not think it\n      was a sign of rain, as the peasants believe. He had observed, on the\n      contrary, that nine times in ten the scintillation of stars was an augury\n      of fine weather.",
                "Near the little bridge they found old iron-shops lighted by smoky lamps.\n      She ran into them. She turned a corner and went into a shop in which queer\n      stuffs were hanging. Behind the dirty panes a lighted candle showed pots,\n      porcelain vases, a clarinet, and a bride's wreath.",
                "He did not understand what pleasure she found in her search.",
                "\"These shops are full of vermin. What can you find interesting in them?\"",
                "\"Everything. I think of the poor bride whose wreath is under that globe.\n      The dinner occurred at Maillot. There was a policeman in the procession.\n      There is one in almost all the bridal processions one sees in the park on\n      Saturdays. Don't they move you, my friend, all these poor, ridiculous,\n      miserable beings who contribute to the grandeur of the past?\"",
                "Among cups decorated with flowers she discovered a little knife, the ivory\n      handle of which represented a tall, thin woman with her hair arranged a la\n      Maintenon. She bought it for a few sous. It pleased her, because she\n      already had a fork like it. Le Menil confessed that he had no taste for\n      such things, but said that his aunt knew a great deal about them. At Caen\n      all the merchants knew her. She had restored and furnished her house in\n      proper style. This house was noted as early as 1690. In one of its halls\n      were white cases full of books. His aunt had wished to put them in order.\n      She had found frivolous books in them, ornamented with engravings so\n      unconventional that she had burned them.",
                "\"Is she silly, your aunt?\" asked Therese.",
                "For a long time his anecdotes about his aunt had made her impatient. Her\n      friend had in the country a mother, sisters, aunts, and numerous relatives\n      whom she did not know and who irritated her. He talked of them with\n      admiration. It annoyed her that he often visited them. When he came back,\n      she imagined that he carried with him the odor of things that had been\n      packed up for years. He was astonished, naively, and he suffered from her\n      antipathy to them.",
                "He said nothing. The sight of a public-house, the panes of which were\n      flaming, recalled to him the poet Choulette, who passed for a drunkard. He\n      asked her if she still saw that Choulette, who called on her wearing a\n      mackintosh and a red muffler.",
                "It annoyed her that he spoke like General Lariviere. She did not say that\n      she had not seen Choulette since autumn, and that he neglected her with\n      the capriciousness of a man not in society.",

                "\"Not welcome in respectable houses -- Choulette? Don't you know that he\n      goes every year for a month to the Marquise de Rieu? Yes, to the Marquise\n      de Rieu, the Catholic, the royalist. But since Choulette interests you,\n      listen to his latest adventure. Paul Vence related it to me. I understand\n      it better in this street, where there are shirts and flowerpots at the\n      windows.",
                "\"This winter, one night when it was raining, Choulette went into a\n      public-house in a street the name of which I have forgotten, but which\n      must resemble this one, and met there an unfortunate girl whom the waiters\n      would not have noticed, and whom he liked for her humility. Her name was\n      Maria. The name was not hers. She found it nailed on her door at the top\n      of the stairway where she went to lodge. Choulette was touched by this\n      perfection of poverty and infamy. He called her his sister, and kissed her\n      hands. Since then he has not quitted her a moment. He takes her to the\n      coffee-houses of the Latin Quarter where the rich students read their\n      reviews. He says sweet things to her. He weeps, she weeps. They drink; and\n      when they are drunk, they fight. He loves her. He calls her his chaste\n      one, his cross and his salvation. She was barefooted; he gave her yarn and\n      knitting-needles that she might make stockings. And he made shoes for this\n      unfortunate girl himself, with enormous nails. He teaches her verses that\n      are easy to understand. He is afraid of altering her moral beauty by\n      taking her out of the shame where she lives in perfect simplicity and\n      admirable destitution.\"",
                "Le Menil shrugged his shoulders.",
                "\"But that Choulette is crazy, and Paul Vence has no right to tell you such\n      stories. I am not austere, assuredly; but there are immoralities that\n      disgust me.\" They were walking at random. She fell into a dream.",
                "\"Yes, morality, I know -- duty! But duty -- it takes the devil to\n      discover it. I can assure you that I do not know where duty is. It's like\n      a young lady's turtle at Joinville. We spent all the evening looking for\n      it under the furniture, and when we had found it, we went to bed.\"",

But now\n      that everybody is in the army, there are neither officers nor soldiers. It\n      all looks like a railway station on Sunday.

She does not look like the country moon at\n      Joinville. At Joinville I have a path -- a flat path -- with the\n      moon at the end of it. She is not there every night; but she returns\n      faithfully, full, red, familiar. She is a country neighbor. I go seriously\n      to meet her. But this moon of Paris I should not like to know. She is not\n      respectable company. Oh, the things that she has seen during the time she\n      has been roaming around the roofs!\"",

                "The reminiscence of this little path where she walked alone moved him,\n      troubled him, made him live again the enchanted hours of his first desires\n      and hopes. He tried to find her hand in her muff and pressed her slim\n      wrist under the fur.",

                "He did not wish to go in. He declared that the door was closed. She pushed\n      it, and slipped into the immense nave, where the inanimate trees of the\n      columns ascended in darkness. In the rear, candles were moving in front of\n      spectre-like priests, under the last reverberations of the organs. She\n      trembled in the silence, and said:",
                "\"The sadness of churches at night moves me; I feel in them the grandeur of\n      nothingness.\"",
                "He replied:",
                "\"We must believe in something. If there were no God, if our souls were not\n      immortal, it would be too sad.\"",
                "She remained for a while immovable under the curtains of shadow hanging\n      from the arches. Then she said:",
                "\"My poor friend, we do not know what to do with this life, which is so\n      short, and yet you desire another life which shall never finish.\"",
                "In the carriage that took them back he said gayly that he had passed a\n      fine afternoon. He kissed her, satisfied with her and with himself. But\n      his good-humor was not communicated to her. The last moments they passed\n      together were spoiled for her always by the presentiment that he would not\n      say at parting the thing that he should say. Ordinarily, he quitted her\n      brusquely, as if what had happened were not to last. At every one of their\n      partings she had a confused feeling that they were parting forever. She\n      suffered from this in advance and became irritable.",
                "Under the trees he took her hand and kissed her.",
                "\"Is it not rare, Therese, to love as we love each other?\"",
                "\"Rare? I don't know; but I think that you love me.\"",
                "\"And you?\"",
                "\"I, too, love you.\"",

                "He remained anxious, with a wretched air. She was kind and she reassured\n      him:",
                "\"You know very well, my friend, that I am not fickle.\"",
                "Almost at the end of the lane they said good-by. He kept the carriage to\n      return to the Rue Royale. He was to dine at the club and go to the\n      theatre, and had no time to lose.",
                "Therese returned home on foot. Opposite the Trocadero she remembered what\n      the old flower-woman had said: \"One can see that you are young.\" The words\n      came back to her with a significance not immoral but sad. \"One can see\n      that you are young!\" Yes, she was young, she was loved, and she was bored\n      to death."

                "CHAPTER III. A DISCUSSION ON THE LITTLE CORPORAL",
                "In the centre of the table flowers were disposed in a basket of gilded\n      bronze, decorated with eagles, stars, and bees, and handles formed like\n      horns of plenty. On its sides winged Victorys supported the branches of\n      candelabra. This centrepiece of the Empire style had been given by\n      Napoleon, in 1812, to Count Martin de l'Aisne, grandfather of the present\n      Count Martin-Belleme. Martin de l'Aisne, a deputy to the Legislative Corps\n      in 1809, was appointed the following year member of the Committee on\n      Finance, the assiduous and secret works of which suited his laborious\n      temperament. Although a Liberal, he pleased the Emperor by his application\n      and his exact honesty. For two years he was under a rain of favors. In\n      1813 he formed part of the moderate majority which approved the report in\n      which Laine censured power and misfortune, by giving to the Empire tardy\n      advice. January 1, 1814, he went with his colleagues to the Tuileries. The\n      Emperor received them in a terrifying manner. He charged on their ranks.\n      Violent and sombre, in the horror of his present strength and of his\n      coming fall, he stunned them with his anger and his contempt.",
                "He came and went through their lines, and suddenly took Count Martin by\n      the shoulders, shook him and dragged him, exclaiming: \"A throne is four\n      pieces of wood covered with velvet? No! A throne is a man, and that man is\n      I. You have tried to throw mud at me. Is this the time to remonstrate with\n      me when there are two hundred thousand Cossacks at the frontiers? Your\n      Laine is a wicked man. One should wash one's dirty linen at home.\" And\n      while in his anger he twisted in his hand the embroidered collar of the\n      deputy, he said: \"The people know me. They do not know you. I am the elect\n      of the nation. You are the obscure delegates of a department.\" He\n      predicted to them the fate of the Girondins. The noise of his spurs\n      accompanied the sound of his voice. Count Martin remained trembling the\n      rest of his life, and tremblingly recalled the Bourbons after the defeat\n      of the Emperor. The two restorations were in vain; the July government and\n      the Second Empire covered his oppressed breast with crosses and cordons.\n      Raised to the highest functions, loaded with honors by three kings and one\n      emperor, he felt forever on his shoulder the hand of the Corsican. He died\n      a senator of Napoleon III, and left a son agitated by the same fear.",
                "This son had married Mademoiselle Belleme, daughter of the first president\n      of the court of Bourges, and with her the political glories of a family\n      which gave three ministers to the moderate monarch. The Bellemes,\n      advocates in the time of Louis XV, elevated the Jacobin origins of the\n      Martins. The second Count Martin was a member of all the Assemblies until\n      his death in 1881. His son took without trouble his seat in the Chamber of\n      Deputies. Having married Mademoiselle Therese Montessuy, whose dowry\n      supported his political fortune, he appeared discreetly among the four or\n      five bourgeois, titled and wealthy, who rallied to democracy, and were\n      received without much bad grace by the republicans, whom aristocracy\n      flattered.",
                "In the dining-room, Count Martin-Belleme was doing the honors of his table\n      with the good grace, the sad politeness, recently prescribed at the Elysee\n      to represent isolated France at a great northern court. From time to time\n      he addressed vapid phrases to Madame Garain at his right; to the Princess\n      Seniavine at his left, who, loaded with diamonds, felt bored. Opposite\n      him, on the other side of the table, Countess Martin, having by her side\n      General Lariviere and M. Schmoll, member of the Academie des Inscriptions,\n      caressed with her fan her smooth white shoulders. At the two semicircles,\n      whereby the dinner-table was prolonged, were M. Montessuy, robust, with\n      blue eyes and ruddy complexion; a young cousin, Madame Belleme de\n      Saint-Nom, embarrassed by her long, thin arms; the painter Duviquet; M.\n      Daniel Salomon; then Paul Vence and Garain the deputy; Belleme de\n      Saint-Nom; an unknown senator; and Dechartre, who was dining at the house\n      for the first time. The conversation, at first trivial and insignificant,\n      was prolonged into a confused murmur, above which rose Garain's voice:",
                "\"Every false idea is dangerous. People think that dreamers do no harm.\n      They are mistaken: dreamers do a great heal of harm. Even apparently\n      inoffensive utopian ideas really exercise a noxious influence. They tend\n      to inspire disgust at reality.\"",
                "\"It is, perhaps, because reality is not beautiful,\" said Paul Vence.",
                "M. Garain said that he had always been in favor of all possible\n      improvements. He had asked for the suppression of permanent armies in the\n      time of the Empire, for the separation of church and state, and had\n      remained always faithful to democracy. His device, he said, was \"Order and\n      Progress.\" He thought he had discovered that device.",
                "Montessuy said:",
                "\"Well, Monsieur Garain, be sincere. Confess that there are no reforms to\n      be made, and that it is as much as one can do to change the color of\n      postage-stamps. Good or bad, things are as they should be. Yes, things are\n      as they should be; but they change incessantly. Since 1870 the industrial\n      and financial situation of the country has gone through four or five\n      revolutions which political economists had not foreseen and which they do\n      not yet understand. In society, as in nature, transformations are\n      accomplished from within.\"",
                "As to matters of government his ideas were terse and decided. He was\n      strongly attached to the present, heedless of the future, and the\n      socialists troubled him little. Without caring whether the sun and capital\n      should be extinguished some day, he enjoyed them. According to him, one\n      should let himself be carried. None but fools resisted the current or\n      tried to go in front of it.",
                "But Count Martin, naturally sad, had, dark presentiments. In veiled words\n      he announced catastrophes. His timorous phrases came through the flowers,\n      and irritated M. Schmoll, who began to grumble and to prophesy. He\n      explained that Christian nations were incapable, alone and by themselves,\n      of throwing off barbarism, and that without the Jews and the Arabs Europe\n      would be to-day, as in the time of the Crusades, sunk in ignorance,\n      misery, and cruelty.",
                "\"The Middle Ages,\" he said, \"are closed only in the historical manuals\n      that are given to pupils to spoil their minds. In reality, barbarians are\n      always barbarians. Israel's mission is to instruct nations. It was Israel\n      which, in the Middle Ages, brought to Europe the wisdom of ages. Socialism\n      frightens you. It is a Christian evil, like priesthood. And anarchy? Do\n      you not recognize in it the plague of the Albigeois and of the Vaudois?\n      The Jews, who instructed and polished Europe, are the only ones who can\n      save it to-day from the evangelical evil by which it is devoured. But they\n      have not fulfilled their duty. They have made Christians of themselves\n      among the Christians. And God punishes them. He permits them to be exiled\n      and to be despoiled. Anti-Semitism is making fearful progress everywhere.\n      From Russia my co-religionists are expelled like savage beasts. In France,\n      civil and military employments are closing against Jews. They have no\n      longer access to aristocratic circles. My nephew, young Isaac Coblentz,\n      has had to renounce a diplomatic career, after passing brilliantly his\n      admission examination. The wives of several of my colleagues, when Madame\n      Schmoll calls on them, display with intention, under her eyes,\n      anti-Semitic newspapers. And would you believe that the Minister of Public\n      Instruction has refused to give me the cross of the Legion of Honor for\n      which I have applied? There's ingratitude! Anti-Semitism is death -- it\n      is death, do you hear? to European civilization.\"",
                "The little man had a natural manner which surpassed all the art in the\n      world. Grotesque and terrible, he threw the table into consternation by\n      his sincerity. Madame Martin, whom he amused, complimented him on this:",
                "\"At least,\" she said, \"you defend your co-religionists. You are not,\n      Monsieur Schmoll, like a beautiful Jewish lady of my acquaintance who,\n      having read in a journal that she received the elite of Jewish society,\n      went everywhere shouting that she had been insulted.\"",
                "\"I am sure, Madame, that you do not know how beautiful and superior to all\n      other moralities is Jewish morality. Do you know the parable of the three\n      rings?\"",
                "This question was lost in the murmur of the dialogues wherein were mingled\n      foreign politics, exhibitions of paintings, fashionable scandals, and\n      Academy speeches. They talked of the new novel and of the coming play.\n      This was a comedy. Napoleon was an incidental character in it.",
                "The conversation settled upon Napoleon I, often placed on the stage and\n      newly studied in books -- an object of curiosity, a personage in the\n      fashion, no longer a popular hero, a demi-god, wearing boots for his\n      country, as in the days when Norvins and Beranger, Charlet and Raffet were\n      composing his legend; but a curious personage, an amusing type in his\n      living infinity, a figure whose style is pleasant to artists, whose\n      movements attract thoughtless idlers.",
                "Garain, who had founded his political fortune on hatred of the Empire,\n      judged sincerely that this return of national taste was only an absurd\n      infatuation. He saw no danger in it and felt no fear about it. In him fear\n      was sudden and ferocious. For the moment he was very quiet; he talked\n      neither of prohibiting performances nor of seizing books, of imprisoning\n      authors, or of suppressing anything. Calm and severe, he saw in Napoleon\n      only Taine's 'condottiere' who kicked Volney in the stomach. Everybody\n      wished to define the true Napoleon. Count Martin, in the face of the\n      imperial centrepiece and of the winged Victorys, talked suitably of\n      Napoleon as an organizer and administrator, and placed him in a high\n      position as president of the state council, where his words threw light\n      upon obscure questions. Garain affirmed that in his sessions, only too\n      famous, Napoleon, under pretext of taking snuff, asked the councillors to\n      pass to him their gold boxes ornamented with miniatures and decked with\n      diamonds, which they never saw again. The anecdote was told to him by the\n      son of Mounier himself.",
                "Montessuy esteemed in Napoleon the genius of order. \"He liked,\" he said,\n      \"work well done. That is a taste most persons have lost.\"",
                "The painter Duviquet, whose ideas were those of an artist, was\n      embarrassed. He did not find on the funeral mask brought from St. Helena\n      the characteristics of that face, beautiful and powerful, which medals and\n      busts have consecrated. One must be convinced of this now that the bronze\n      of that mask was hanging in all the old shops, among eagles and sphinxes\n      made of gilded wood. And, according to him, since the true face of\n      Napoleon was not that of the ideal Napoleon, his real soul may not have\n      been as idealists fancied it. Perhaps it was the soul of a good bourgeois.\n      Somebody had said this, and he was inclined to think that it was true.\n      Anyway, Duviquet, who flattered himself with having made the best\n      portraits of the century, knew that celebrated men seldom resemble the\n      ideas one forms of them.",
                "M. Daniel Salomon observed that the fine mask about which Duviquet talked,\n      the plaster cast taken from the inanimate face of the Emperor, and brought\n      to Europe by Dr. Antommarchi, had been moulded in bronze and sold by\n      subscription for the first time in 1833, under Louis Philippe, and had\n      then inspired surprise and mistrust. People suspected the Italian chemist,\n      who was a sort of buffoon, always talkative and famished, of having tried\n      to make fun of people. Disciples of Dr. Gall, whose system was then in\n      favor, regarded the mask as suspicious. They did not find in it the bumps\n      of genius; and the forehead, examined in accordance with the master's\n      theories, presented nothing remarkable in its formation.",
                "\"Precisely,\" said Princess Seniavine. \"Napoleon was remarkable only for\n      having kicked Volney in the stomach and stealing a snuffbox ornamented\n      with diamonds. Monsieur Garain has just taught us.\"",
                "\"And yet,\" said Madame Martin, \"nobody is sure that he kicked Volney.\"",
                "\"Everything becomes known in the end,\" replied the Princess, gayly.\n      \"Napoleon did nothing at all. He did not even kick Volney, and his head\n      was that of an idiot.\"",
                "General Lariviere felt that he should say something. He hurled this\n      phrase:",
                "\"Napoleon -- his campaign of 1813 is much discussed.\"",
                "The General wished to please Garain, and he had no other idea. However, he\n      succeeded, after an effort, in formulating a judgment:",
                "\"Napoleon committed faults; in his situation he should not have committed\n      any.\" And he stopped abruptly, very red.",
                "Madame Martin asked:",
                "\"And you, Monsieur Vence, what do you think of Napoleon?\"",
                "\"Madame, I have not much love for sword-bearers, and conquerors seem to me\n      to be dangerous fools. But in spite of everything, that figure of the\n      Emperor interests me as it interests the public. I find character and life\n      in it. There is no poem or novel that is worth the Memoirs of Saint\n      Helena, although it is written in ridiculous fashion. What I think of\n      Napoleon, if you wish to know, is that, made for glory, he had the\n      brilliant simplicity of the hero of an epic poem. A hero must be human.\n      Napoleon was human.\"",
                "\"Oh, oh!\" every one exclaimed.",
                "But Paul Vence continued:",
                "\"He was violent and frivolous; therefore profoundly human. I mean, similar\n      to everybody. He desired, with singular force, all that most men esteem\n      and desire. He had illusions, which he gave to the people. This was his\n      power and his weakness; it was his beauty. He believed in glory. He had of\n      life and of the world the same opinion as any one of his grenadiers. He\n      retained always the infantile gravity which finds pleasure in playing with\n      swords and drums, and the sort of innocence which makes good military men.\n      He esteemed force sincerely. He was a man among men, the flesh of human\n      flesh. He had not a thought that was not in action, and all his actions\n      were grand yet common. It is this vulgar grandeur which makes heroes. And\n      Napoleon is the perfect hero. His brain never surpassed his hand -- that\n      hand, small and beautiful, which grasped the world. He never had, for a\n      moment, the least care for what he could not reach.\"",
                "\"Then,\" said Garain, \"according to you, he was not an intellectual genius.\n      I am of your opinion.\"",
                "\"Surely,\" continued Paul Vence, \"he had enough genius to be brilliant in\n      the civil and military arena of the world. But he had not speculative\n      genius. That genius is another pair of sleeves, as Buffon says. We have a\n      collection of his writings and speeches. His style has movement and\n      imagination. And in this mass of thoughts one can not find a philosophic\n      curiosity, not one expression of anxiety about the unknowable, not an\n      expression of fear of the mystery which surrounds destiny. At Saint\n      Helena, when he talks of God and of the soul, he seems to be a little\n      fourteen-year-old school-boy. Thrown upon the world, his mind found itself\n      fit for the world, and embraced it all. Nothing of that mind was lost in\n      the infinite. Himself a poet, he knew only the poetry of action. He\n      limited to the earth his powerful dream of life. In his terrible and\n      touching naivete he believed that a man could be great, and neither time\n      nor misfortune made him lose that idea. His youth, or rather his sublime\n      adolescence, lasted as long as he lived, because life never brought him a\n      real maturity. Such is the abnormal state of men of action. They live\n      entirely in the present, and their genius concentrates on one point. The\n      hours of their existence are not connected by a chain of grave and\n      disinterested meditations. They succeed themselves in a series of acts.\n      They lack interior life. This defect is particularly visible in Napoleon,\n      who never lived within himself. From this is derived the frivolity of\n      temperament which made him support easily the enormous load of his evils\n      and of his faults. His mind was born anew every day. He had, more than any\n      other person, a capacity for diversion. The first day that he saw the sun\n      rise on his funereal rock at Saint Helena, he jumped from his bed,\n      whistling a romantic air. It was the peace of a mind superior to fortune;\n      it was the frivolity of a mind prompt in resurrection. He lived from the\n      outside.\"",
                "Garain, who did not like Paul Vence's ingenious turn of wit and language,\n      tried to hasten the conclusion:",
                "\"In a word,\" he said, \"there was something of the monster in the man.\"",
                "\"There are no monsters,\" replied Paul Vence; \"and men who pass for\n      monsters inspire horror. Napoleon was loved by an entire people. He had\n      the power to win the love of men. The joy of his soldiers was to die for\n      him.\"",
                "Countess Martin would have wished Dechartre to give his opinion. But he\n      excused himself with a sort of fright.",
                "\"Do you know,\" said Schmoll again, \"the parable of the three rings,\n      sublime inspiration of a Portuguese Jew.\"",
                "Garain, while complimenting Paul Vence on his brilliant paradox, regretted\n      that wit should be exercised at the expense of morality and justice.",
                "\"One great principle,\" he said, \"is that men should be judged by their\n      acts.\"",
                "\"And women?\" asked Princess Seniavine, brusquely; \"do you judge them by\n      their acts? And how do you know what they do?\"",
                "The sound of voices was mingled with the clear tintinabulation of\n      silverware. A warm air bathed the room. The roses shed their leaves on the\n      cloth. More ardent thoughts mounted to the brain.",
                "General Lariviere fell into dreams.",
                "\"When public clamor has split my ears,\" he said to his neighbor, \"I shall\n      go to live at Tours. I shall cultivate flowers.\"",
                "He flattered himself on being a good gardener; his name had been given to\n      a rose. This pleased him highly.",
                "Schmoll asked again if they knew the parable of the three rings.",
                "The Princess rallied the Deputy.",
                "\"Then you do not know, Monsieur Garain, that one does the same things for\n      very different reasons?\"",
                "Montessuy said she was right.",
                "\"It is very true, as you say, Madame, that actions prove nothing. This\n      thought is striking in an episode in the life of Don Juan, which was known\n      neither to Moliere nor to Mozart, but which is revealed in an English\n      legend, a knowledge of which I owe to my friend James Russell Lowell of\n      London. One learns from it that the great seducer lost his time with three\n      women. One was a bourgeoise: she was in love with her husband; the other\n      was a nun: she would not consent to violate her vows; the third, who had\n      for a long time led a life of debauchery, had become ugly, and was a\n      servant in a den. After what she had done, after what she had seen, love\n      signified nothing to her. These three women behaved alike for very\n      different reasons. An action proves nothing. It is the mass of actions,\n      their weight, their sum total, which makes the value of the human being.\"",
                "\"Some of our actions,\" said Madame Martin, \"have our look, our face: they\n      are our daughters. Others do not resemble us at all.\"",

At night, near\n      his mother, whom he loves, he studies, he reads books. In his mind, simple\n      and receptive, ideas lodge themselves like bullets in a wall. He has no\n      desires. He has neither the passions nor the vices that attach us to life.\n      He is solitary and pure. Endowed with strong virtues, he becomes\n      conceited. He lives among miserable people.

Oh, I\n      know very well that all this is not worth the trouble that a woman takes\n      in giving herself to a man; but it is a trouble that is worth something,\n      because my trouble is myself, my life. I like to enjoy what I like, or\n      think what I like. I do not wish to lose. I am like papa: I demand what is\n      due to me. And then -- \"",

                "The obstacles seemed light; calls, a gown to be tried on, a charity fair,\n      exhibitions. As she dilated upon the difficulties they seemed to increase.\n      The calls could not be postponed; there were three fairs; the exhibitions\n      would soon close. In fine, it was impossible for her to see him again\n      before his departure.",
                "As he was well accustomed to making excuses of that sort, he failed to\n      observe that it was not natural for Therese to offer them. Embarrassed by\n      this tissue of social obligations, he did not persist, but remained silent\n      and unhappy.",
                "With her left arm she raised the portiere, placed her right hand on the\n      key of the door; and, standing against the rich background of the sapphire\n      and ruby-colored folds of the Oriental draperies, she turned her head\n      toward the friend she was leaving, and said, a little mockingly, yet with\n      a touch of tragic emotion:",
                "\"Good-by, Robert. Enjoy yourself. My calls, my errands, your little visits\n      are nothing. Life is made up of just such trifles. Good-by!\"",
                "She went out. He would have liked to accompany her, but he made it a point\n      not to show himself with her in the street, unless she absolutely forced\n      him to do so.",
                "In the street, Therese felt suddenly that she was alone in the world,\n      without joy and without pain. She returned to her house on foot, as was\n      her habit. It was night; the air was frozen, clear, and tranquil. But the\n      avenues through which she walked, in shadows studded with lights,\n      enveloped her with that mild atmosphere of the queen of cities, so\n      agreeable to its inhabitants, which makes itself felt even in the cold of\n      winter. She walked between the lines of huts and old houses, remains of\n      the field-days of Auteuil, which tall houses interrupted here and there.\n      These small shops, these monotonous windows, were nothing to her. Yet she\n      felt that she was under the mysterious spell of the friendship of\n      inanimate things; and it seemed to her that the stones, the doors of\n      houses, the lights behind the windowpanes, looked kindly upon her. She was\n      alone, and she wished to be alone. The steps she was taking between the\n      two houses wherein her habits were almost equal, the steps she had taken\n      so often, to-day seemed to her irrevocable. Why? What had that day\n      brought? Not exactly a quarrel. And yet the words spoken that day had left\n      a subtle, strange, persistent sting, which would never leave her. What had\n      happened? Nothing. And that nothing had effaced everything. She had a sort\n      of obscure certainty that she would never return to that room which had so\n      recently enclosed the most secret and dearest phases of her life. She had\n      loved Robert with the seriousness of a necessary joy. Made to be loved,\n      and very reasonable, she had not lost in the abandonment of herself that\n      instinct of reflection, that necessity for security, which was so strong\n      in her. She had not chosen: one seldom chooses. She had not allowed\n      herself to be taken at random and by surprise. She had done what she had\n      wished to do, as much as one ever does what one wishes to do in such\n      cases. She had nothing to regret. He had been to her what it was his duty\n      to be. She felt, in spite of everything, that all was at an end. She\n      thought, with dry sadness, that three years of her life had been given to\n      an honest man who had loved her and whom she had loved. \"For I loved him.\n      I must have loved him in order to give myself to him.\" But she could not\n      feel again the sentiments of early days, the movements of her mind when\n      she had yielded. She recalled small and insignificant circumstances: the\n      flowers on the wall-paper and the pictures in the room. She recalled the\n      words, a little ridiculous and almost touching, that he had said to her.\n      But it seemed to her that the adventure had occurred to another woman, to\n      a stranger whom she did not like and whom she hardly understood. And what\n      had happened only a moment ago seemed far distant now. The room, the\n      lilacs in the crystal vase, the little cup of Bohemian glass where she\n      found her pins -- she saw all these things as if through a window that\n      one passes in the street. She was without bitterness, and even without\n      sadness. She had nothing to forgive, alas! This absence for a week was not\n      a betrayal, it was not a fault against her; it was nothing, yet it was\n      everything. It was the end. She knew it. She wished to cease. It was the\n      consent of all the forces of her being. She said to herself: \"I have no\n      reason to love him less. Do I love him no more? Did I ever love him?\" She\n      did not know and she did not care to know. Three years, during which there\n      had been months when they had seen each other every day -- was all this\n      nothing? Life is not a great thing. And what one puts in it, how little\n      that is!",
                "In fine, she had nothing of which to complain. But it was better to end it\n      all. All these reflections brought her back to that point. It was not a\n      resolution; resolutions may be changed. It was graver: it was a state of\n      the body and of the mind.",
                "When she arrived at the square, in the centre of which is a fountain, and\n      on one side of which stands a church of rustic style, showing its bell in\n      an open belfry, she recalled the little bouquet of violets that he had\n      given to her one night on the bridge near Notre Dame. They had loved each\n      other that day -- perhaps more than usual. Her heart softened at that\n      reminiscence. But the little bouquet remained alone, a poor little flower\n      skeleton, in her memory.",
                "While she was thinking, passers-by, deceived by the simplicity of her\n      dress, followed her. One of them made propositions to her: a dinner and\n      the theatre. It amused her. She was not at all disturbed; this was not a\n      crisis. She thought: \"How do other women manage such things? And I, who\n      promised myself not to spoil my life. What is life worth?\"",
                "Opposite the Greek lantern of the Musee des Religions she found the soil\n      disturbed by workmen. There were paving-stones crossed by a bridge made of\n      a narrow flexible plank. She had stepped on it, when she saw at the other\n      end, in front of her, a man who was waiting for her. He recognized her and\n      bowed. It was Dechartre. She saw that he was happy to meet her; she\n      thanked him with a smile. He asked her permission to walk a few steps with\n      her, and they entered into the large and airy space. In this place the\n      tall houses, set somewhat back, efface themselves, and reveal a glimpse of\n      the sky.",

                "She replied that she liked to walk; it was her pleasure, and the cause of\n      her good health.",
                "He, too, liked to walk in populous towns and beautiful fields. The mystery\n      of highways tempted him. He liked to travel. Although voyages had become\n      common and easy, they retained for him their powerful charm. He had seen\n      golden days and crystalline nights, Greece, Egypt, and the Bosporus; but\n      it was to Italy that he returned always, as to the mother country of his\n      mind.",
                "\"I shall go there next week,\" he said. \"I long to see again Ravenna asleep\n      among the black pines of its sterile shore. Have you seen Ravenna, Madame?\n      It is an enchanted tomb where sparkling phantoms appear. The magic of\n      death lies there. The mosaic works of Saint Vitale, with their barbarous\n      angels and their aureolated empresses, make one feel the monstrous\n      delights of the Orient. Despoiled to-day of its silver lamels, the grave\n      of Galla Placidia is frightful under its crypt, luminous yet gloomy. When\n      one looks through an opening in the sarcophagus, it seems as if one saw\n      the daughter of Theodosius, seated on her golden chair, erect in her gown\n      studded with stones and embroidered with scenes from the Old Testament;\n      her beautiful, cruel face preserved hard and black with aromatic plants,\n      and her ebony hands immovable on her knees. For thirteen centuries she\n      retained this funereal majesty, until one day a child passed a candle\n      through the opening of the grave and burned the body.\"",
                "Madame Martin-Belleme asked what that dead woman, so obstinate in her\n      conceit, had done during her life.",
                "\"Twice a slave,\" said Dechartre, \"she became twice an empress.\"",
                "\"She must have been beautiful,\" said Madame Martin. \"You have made me see\n      her too vividly in her tomb. She frightens me. Shall you go to Venice,\n      Monsieur Dechartre? Or are you tired of gondolas, of canals bordered by\n      palaces, and of the pigeons of Saint Mark? I confess that I still like\n      Venice, after being there three times.\"",
                "He said she was right. He, too, liked Venice.",
                "Whenever he went there, from a sculptor he became a painter, and made\n      studies. He would like to paint its atmosphere.",
                "\"Elsewhere,\" he said, \"even in Florence, the sky is too high. At Venice it\n      is everywhere; it caresses the earth and the water. It envelops lovingly\n      the leaden domes and the marble facades, and throws into the iridescent\n      atmosphere its pearls and its crystals. The beauty of Venice is in its sky\n      and its women. What pretty creatures the Venetian women are! Their forms\n      are so slender and supple under their black shawls. If nothing remained of\n      these women except a bone, one would find in that bone the charm of their\n      exquisite structure. Sundays, at church, they form laughing groups,\n      agitated, with hips a little pointed, elegant necks, flowery smiles, and\n      inflaming glances. And all bend, with the suppleness of young animals, at\n      the passage of a priest whose head resembles that of Vitellius, and who\n      carries the chalice, preceded by two choir-boys.\"",
                "He walked with unequal step, following the rhythm of his ideas, sometimes\n      quick, sometimes slow. She walked more regularly, and almost outstripped\n      him. He looked at her sidewise, and liked her firm and supple carriage. He\n      observed the little shake which at moments her obstinate head gave to the\n      holly on her toque.",
                "Without expecting it, he felt a charm in that meeting, almost intimate,\n      with a young woman almost unknown.",
                "They had reached the place where the large avenue unfolds its four rows of\n      trees. They were following the stone parapet surmounted by a hedge of\n      boxwood, which entirely hides the ugliness of the buildings on the quay.\n      One felt the presence of the river by the milky atmosphere which in misty\n      days seems to rest on the water. The sky was clear. The lights of the city\n      were mingled with the stars. At the south shone the three golden nails of\n      the Orion belt. Dechartre continued:",
                "\"Last year, at Venice, every morning as I went out of my house, I saw at\n      her door, raised by three steps above the canal, a charming girl, with\n      small head, neck round and strong, and graceful hips. She was there, in\n      the sun and surrounded by vermin, as pure as an amphora, fragrant as a\n      flower. She smiled. What a mouth! The richest jewel in the most beautiful\n      light. I realized in time that this smile was addressed to a butcher\n      standing behind me with his basket on his head.\"",
                "At the corner of the short street which goes to the quay, between two\n      lines of small gardens, Madame Martin walked more slowly.",
                "\"It is true that at Venice,\" she said, \"all women are pretty.\"",
                "\"They are almost all pretty, Madame. I speak of the common girls -- the\n      cigar-girls, the girls among the glass-workers. The others are commonplace\n      enough.\"",

While he talked of the events of the day, she\n      fell into a sad reverie. It seemed to her that she floated in a mist. It\n      was a peaceful and almost sweet suffering. She saw vaguely through the\n      clouds the little room of the Rue Spontini transported by angels to one of\n      the summits of the Himalaya Mountains, and Robert Le Menil -- in the\n      quaking of a sort of world's end -- had disappeared while putting on\n      his gloves. She felt her pulse to see whether she were feverish. A rattle\n      of silverware on the table awoke her. She heard her husband saying:",

Gavaut\n      never had any ideas except at his elbows. Does anybody take him seriously\n      in the political world? You may be sure that he never gave an illusion to\n      any woman, not even his wife. And yet to produce that sort of illusion a\n      man does not need much.\" She added, brusquely:",

How wretchedly inadequate are the little signs which form\n      syllables, words, and phrases. What becomes of the idea, the beautiful\n      idea, which these miserable hieroglyphics hide? What does the reader make\n      of my writing? A series of false sense, of counter sense, and of nonsense.\n      To read, to hear, is to translate. There are beautiful translations,\n      perhaps. There are no faithful translations. Why should I care for the\n      admiration which they give to my books, since it is what they themselves\n      see in them that they admire? Every reader substitutes his visions in the\n      place of ours. We furnish him with the means to quicken his imagination.\n      It is a horrible thing to be a cause of such exercises.

He feels that he\n      is alone when he is thinking, alone when he is writing. Whatever one may\n      do, one is always alone in the world. That is what he wishes to say. He is\n      right. You may always explain: you never are understood.\"",

                "Vence replied that Choulette was very busy in forming the Third Order of\n      Saint Francis.",
                "\"The idea, Madame, came to him in a marvellous fashion one day when he had\n      gone to call on his Maria in the street where she lives, behind the public\n      hospital -- a street always damp, the houses on which are tottering.\n      You must know that he considers Maria the saint and martyr who is\n      responsible for the sins of the people.",

Either\n      because the martyr was at the wine-shop, where she is familiarly known, or\n      because she was busy in her room, she did not open the door. Choulette\n      rang for a long time, and so violently that the bellrope remained in his\n      hand. Skilful at understanding symbols and the hidden meaning of things,\n      he understood at once that this rope had not been detached without the\n      permission of spiritual powers. He made of it a belt, and realized that he\n      had been chosen to lead back into its primitive purity the Third Order of\n      Saint Francis. He renounced the beauty of women, the delights of poetry,\n      the brightness of glory, and studied the life and the doctrine of Saint\n      Francis. However, he has sold to his editor a book entitled 'Les\n      Blandices', which contains, he says, the description of all sorts of\n      loves. He flatters himself that in it he has shown himself a criminal with\n      some elegance. But far from harming his mystic undertakings, this book\n      favors them in this sense, that, corrected by his later work, he will\n      become honest and exemplary; and the gold that he has received in payment,\n      which would not have been paid to him for a more chaste volume, will serve\n      for a pilgrimage to Assisi.\"",
                "Madame Martin asked how much of this story was really true. Vence replied\n      that she must not try to learn.",

                "He affirmed that at least Choulette was publishing Les Blandices, and\n      desired to visit the cell and the grave of St. Francis.",

                "\"He is not very different from the saints of whose extraordinary lives we\n      read. He is as sincere as they. He has an exquisite delicacy of sentiment\n      and a terrible violence of mind. If he shocks one by many of his acts, the\n      reason is that he is weaker, less supported, or perhaps less closely\n      observed. And then there are unworthy saints, just as there are bad\n      angels: Choulette is a worldly saint, that is all. But his poems are true\n      poems, and much finer than those written by the bishops of the seventeenth\n      century.\"",

He reproached him with trying to\n      reestablish buildings in their primitive plan, as they had been, or as\n      they might have been, at the beginning. Philippe Dechartre, on the\n      contrary, wished that everything which the lapse of centuries had added to\n      a church, an abbey, or a castle should be respected. To abolish\n      anachronisms and restore a building to its primitive unity, seemed to him\n      to be a scientific barbarity as culpable as that of ignorance. He said:\n      'It is a crime to efface the successive imprints made in stone by the\n      hands of our ancestors. New stones cut in old style are false witnesses.' \n      He wished to limit the task of the archaeologic architect to that of\n      supporting and consolidating walls. He was right. Everybody said that he\n      was wrong. He achieved his ruin by dying young, while his rival triumphed.\n      He bequeathed an honest fortune to his widow and his son. Jacques\n      Dechartre was brought up by his mother, who adored him. I do not think\n      that maternal tenderness ever was more impetuous.

                "Madame Martin remembered Jeanne Tancrede; not very pretty, but graceful\n      with a certain slowness of action in playing romantic roles.",
                "\"They lived almost together in a little house at Auteuil,\" Paul Vence\n      continued. \"I often called on them. I found him lost in his dreams,\n      forgetting to model a figure drying under its cloths, alone with himself,\n      pursuing his idea, absolutely incapable of listening to anybody; she,\n      studying her roles, her complexion burned by rouge, her eyes tender,\n      pretty because of her intelligence and her activity. She complained to me\n      that he was inattentive, cross, and unreasonable. She loved him and\n      deceived him only to obtain roles. And when she deceived him, it was done\n      on the spur of the moment. Afterward she never thought of it. A typical\n      woman! But she was imprudent; she smiled upon Joseph Springer in the hope\n      that he would make her a member of the Comedie Francaise. Dechartre left\n      her.

Those who know life well know that women do not easily\n      bind themselves in the chains of real love. They know that nothing is less\n      common than sacrifice among them. And consider how much a worldly woman\n      must sacrifice when she is in love -- liberty, quietness, the charming\n      play of a free mind, coquetry, amusement, pleasure -- she loses\n      everything.",

In\n      one sense the world is right. A woman in love betrays her nature and fails\n      in her function, which is to be admired by all men, like a work of art. A\n      woman is a work of art, the most marvellous that man's industry ever has\n      produced. A woman is a wonderful artifice, due to the concourse of all the\n      arts mechanical and of all the arts liberal. She is the work of everybody,\n      she belongs to the world.\"",

She knew very well that there was in\n      reality neither a Carmel of passion nor a chain of love, nor a beautiful\n      and terrible vocation against which the predestined one resisted in vain;\n      she knew very well that love was only a brief intoxication from which one\n      recovered a little sadder. And yet, perhaps, she did not know everything;\n      perhaps there were loves in which one was deliciously lost. She put out\n      her lamp. The dreams of her first youth came back to her."

                "It was raining. Madame Martin-Belleme saw confusedly through the glass of\n      her coupe the multitude of passing umbrellas, like black turtles under the\n      watery skies. She was thinking. Her thoughts were gray and indistinct,\n      like the aspect of the streets and the squares.",
                "She no longer knew why the idea had come to her to spend a month with Miss\n      Bell. Truly, she never had known. The idea had been like a spring, at\n      first hidden by leaves, and now forming the current of a deep and rapid\n      stream. She remembered that Tuesday night at dinner she had said suddenly\n      that she wished to go, but she could not remember the first flush of that\n      desire. It was not the wish to act toward Robert Le Menil as he was acting\n      toward her. Doubtless she thought it excellent to go travelling in Italy\n      while he went fox-hunting. This seemed to her a fair arrangement. Robert,\n      who was always pleased to see her when he came back, would not find her on\n      his return. She thought this would be right. She had not thought of it at\n      first. And since then she had thought little of it, and really she was not\n      going for the pleasure of making him grieve. She had against him a thought\n      less piquant, and more harsh. She did not wish to see him soon. He had\n      become to her almost a stranger. He seemed to her a man like others -- better\n      than most others -- good-looking, estimable, and who did not displease\n      her; but he did not preoccupy her. Suddenly he had gone out of her life.\n      She could not remember how he had become mingled with it. The idea of\n      belonging to him shocked her. The thought that they might meet again in\n      the small apartment of the Rue Spontini was so painful to her that she\n      discarded it at once. She preferred to think that an unforeseen event\n      would prevent their meeting again -- the end of the world, for example.\n      M. Lagrange, member of the Academie des Sciences, had told her the day\n      before of a comet which some day might meet the earth, envelop it with its\n      flaming hair, imbue animals and plants with unknown poisons, and make all\n      men die in a frenzy of laughter. She expected that this, or something\n      else, would happen next month. It was not inexplicable that she wished to\n      go. But that her desire to go should contain a vague joy, that she should\n      feel the charm of what she was to find, was inexplicable to her.",
                "Her carriage left her at the corner of a street.",
                "There, under the roof of a tall house, behind five windows, in a small,\n      neat apartment, Madame Marmet had lived since the death of her husband.",
                "Countess Martin found her in her modest drawing-room, opposite M.\n      Lagrange, half asleep in a deep armchair. This worldly old savant had\n      remained ever faithful to her. He it was who, the day after M. Marmet's\n      funeral, had conveyed to the unfortunate widow the poisoned speech\n      delivered by Schmoll. She had fainted in his arms. Madame Marmet thought\n      that he lacked judgment, but he was her best friend. They dined together\n      often with rich friends.",
                "Madame Martin, slender and erect in her zibeline corsage opening on a\n      flood of lace, awakened with the charming brightness of her gray eyes the\n      good man, who was susceptible to the graces of women. He had told her the\n      day before how the world would come to an end. He asked her whether she\n      had not been frightened at night by pictures of the earth devoured by\n      flames or frozen to a mass of ice. While he talked to her with affected\n      gallantry, she looked at the mahogany bookcase. There were not many books\n      in it, but on one of the shelves was a skeleton in armor. It amazed one to\n      see in this good lady's house that Etruscan warrior wearing a green bronze\n      helmet and a cuirass. He slept among boxes of bonbons, vases of gilded\n      porcelain, and carved images of the Virgin, picked up at Lucerne and on\n      the Righi. Madame Marmet, in her widowhood, had sold the books which her\n      husband had left. Of all the ancient objects collected by the\n      archaeologist, she had retained nothing except the Etruscan. Many persons\n      had tried to sell it for her. Paul Vence had obtained from the\n      administration a promise to buy it for the Louvre, but the good widow\n      would not part with it. It seemed to her that if she lost that warrior\n      with his green bronze helmet she would lose the name that she wore\n      worthily, and would cease to be the widow of Louis Marmet of the Academie\n      des Inscriptions.",
                "\"Do not be afraid, Madame; a comet will not soon strike the earth. Such a\n      phenomenon is very improbable.\"",
                "Madame Martin replied that she knew no serious reason why the earth and\n      humanity should not be annihilated at once.",
                "Old Lagrange exclaimed with profound sincerity that he hoped the cataclysm\n      would come as late as possible.",
                "She looked at him. His bald head could boast only a few hairs dyed black.\n      His eyelids fell like rags over eyes still smiling; his cheeks hung in\n      loose folds, and one divined that his body was equally withered. She\n      thought, \"And even he likes life!\"",
                "Madame Marmet hoped, too, that the end of the world was not near at hand.",
                "\"Monsieur Lagrange,\" said Madame Martin, \"you live, do you not, in a\n      pretty little house, the windows of which overlook the Botanical Gardens?\n      It seems to me it must be a joy to live in that garden, which makes me\n      think of the Noah's Ark of my infancy, and of the terrestrial paradises in\n      the old Bibles.\"",
                "But he was not at all charmed with his house. It was small, unimproved,\n      infested with rats.",
                "She acknowledged that one seldom felt at home anywhere, and that rats were\n      found everywhere, either real or symbolical, legions of pests that torment\n      us. Yet she liked the Botanical Gardens; she had always wished to go\n      there, yet never had gone. There was also the museum, which she was\n      curious to visit.",
                "Smiling, happy, he offered to escort her there. He considered it his\n      house. He would show her rare specimens, some of which were superb.",
                "She did not know what a bolide was. She recalled that some one had said to\n      her that at the museum were bones carved by primitive men, and plaques of\n      ivory on which were engraved pictures of animals, which were long ago\n      extinct. She asked whether that were true. Lagrange ceased to smile. He\n      replied indifferently that such objects concerned one of his colleagues.",
                "\"Ah!\" said Madame Martin, \"then they are not in your showcase.\"",
                "She observed that learned men were not curious, and that it is indiscreet\n      to question them on things that are not in their own showcases. It is true\n      that Lagrange had made a scientific fortune in studying meteors. This had\n      led him to study comets. But he was wise. For twenty years he had been\n      preoccupied by nothing except dining out.",
                "When he had left, Countess Martin told Madame Marmet what she expected of\n      her.",
                "\"I am going next week to Fiesole, to visit Miss Bell, and you are coming\n      with me.\"",
                "The good Madame Marmet, with placid brow yet searching eyes, was silent\n      for a moment; then she refused gently, but finally consented."

Through the open doors travellers in long cloaks came and\n      went. At the end of the station, blinding with soot and dust, a small\n      rainbow could be discerned, not larger than one's hand. Countess Martin\n      and the good Madame Marniet were already in their carriage, under the rack\n      loaded with bags, among newspapers thrown on the cushions. Choulette had\n      not appeared, and Madame Martin expected him no longer. Yet he had\n      promised to be at the station. He had made his arrangements to go, and had\n      received from his publisher the price of Les Blandices. Paul Vence had\n      brought him one evening to Madame Martin's house. He had been sweet,\n      polished, full of witty gayety and naive joy. She had promised herself\n      much pleasure in travelling with a man of genius, original, picturesquely\n      ugly, with an amusing simplicity; like a child prematurely old and\n      abandoned, full of vices, yet with a certain degree of innocence. The\n      doors closed. She expected him no longer. She should not have counted on\n      his impulsive and vagabondish mind. At the moment when the engine began to\n      breathe hoarsely, Madame Marmet, who was looking out of the window, said,\n      quietly:",

He was almost\n      repulsive; yet, in spite of his fifty years of age, he looked young, so\n      clear and lustrous were his eyes, so much ingenuous audacity had been\n      retained in his yellow, hollow face, so vividly did this old man express\n      the eternal adolescence of the poet and artist. When she saw him, Therese\n      regretted having invited so strange a companion. He walked along, throwing\n      a hasty glance into every carriage -- a glance which, little by little,\n      became sullen and distrustful. But when he recognized Madame Martin, he\n      smiled so sweetly and said good-morning to her in so caressing a voice\n      that nothing was left of the ferocious old vagabond walking on the quay,\n      nothing except the old carpet-bag, the handles of which were half broken.",
                "He placed it in the rack with great care, among the elegant bags enveloped\n      with gray cloth, beside which it looked conspicuously sordid. It was\n      studded with yellow flowers on a blood-colored background.",
                "He was soon perfectly at ease, and complimented Madame Martin on the\n      elegance of her travelling attire.",

The writer, hidden under the\n      vagabond, revealed himself. Choulette, without wishing to appear to be\n      careful of his papers, was very orderly about them. He assured himself\n      that he had not lost the pieces of paper on which he noted at the\n      coffeehouse his ideas for poems, nor the dozen of flattering letters\n      which, soiled and spotted, he carried with him continually, to read them\n      to his newly-made companions at night. After assuring himself that nothing\n      was missing, he took from the book a letter folded in an open envelope. He\n      waved it for a while, with an air of mysterious impudence, then handed it\n      to the Countess Martin.

Having enjoyed the effect which he expected to produce, he said\n      that he should perhaps visit the Princess; that she was a good person, and\n      pious.",
                "\"A truly great lady,\" he added, \"who does not show her magnificence in\n      gowns and hats. She wears her chemises for six weeks, and sometimes\n      longer. The gentlemen of her train have seen her wear very dirty white\n      stockings, which fell around her heels. The virtues of the great queens of\n      Spain are revived in her. Oh, those soiled stockings, what real glory\n      there is in them!\"",

According to him the present regime embodied only\n      hypocrisy and brutality.",
                "\"Their barracks are a hideous invention of modern times. They date from\n      the seventeenth century. Before that time there were only guard-houses\n      where the soldiers played cards and told tales. Louis XIV was a precursor\n      of Bonaparte. But the evil has attained its plenitude since the monstrous\n      institution of the obligatory enlistment. The shame of emperors and of\n      republics is to have made it an obligation for men to kill. In the ages\n      called barbarous, cities and princes entrusted their defence to\n      mercenaries, who fought prudently. In a great battle only five or six men\n      were killed. And when knights went to the wars, at least they were not\n      forced to do it; they died for their pleasure. They were good for nothing\n      else. Nobody in the time of Saint Louis would have thought of sending to\n      battle a man of learning. And the laborer was not torn from the soil to be\n      killed. Nowadays it is a duty for a poor peasant to be a soldier. He is\n      exiled from his house, the roof of which smokes in the silence of night;\n      from the fat prairies where the oxen graze; from the fields and the\n      paternal woods. He is taught how to kill men; he is threatened, insulted,\n      put in prison and told that it is an honor; and, if he does not care for\n      that sort of honor, he is fusilladed. He obeys because he is terrorized,\n      and is of all domestic animals the gentlest and most docile. We are\n      warlike in France, and we are citizens. Another reason to be proud, this\n      being a citizen! For the poor it consists in sustaining and preserving the\n      wealthy in their power and their laziness. The poor must work for this, in\n      presence of the majestic quality of the law which prohibits the wealthy as\n      well as the poor from sleeping under the bridges, from begging in the\n      streets, and from stealing bread. That is one of the good effects of the\n      Revolution. As this Revolution was made by fools and idiots for the\n      benefit of those who acquired national lands, and resulted in nothing but\n      making the fortune of crafty peasants and financiering bourgeois, the\n      Revolution only made stronger, under the pretence of making all men equal,\n      the empire of wealth. It has betrayed France into the hands of the men of\n      wealth. They are masters and lords. The apparent government, composed of\n      poor devils, is in the pay of the financiers. For one hundred years, in\n      this poisoned country, whoever has loved the poor has been considered a\n      traitor to society. A man is called dangerous when he says that there are\n      wretched people. There are laws against indignation and pity, and what I\n      say here could not go into print.\"",
                "Choulette became excited and waved his knife, while under the wintry\n      sunlight passed fields of brown earth, trees despoiled by winter, and\n      curtains of poplars beside silvery rivers.",
                "He looked with tenderness at the figure carved on his stick.",

                "The good Madame Marmet, whose nephew was a captain in the artillery, was\n      shocked at the violence with which Choulette attacked the army. Madame\n      Martin saw in this only an amusing fantasy. Choulette's ideas did not\n      frighten her. She was afraid of nothing. But she thought they were a\n      little absurd. She did not think that the past had ever been better than\n      the present.",
                "\"I believe, Monsieur Choulette, that men were always as they are to-day,\n      selfish, avaricious, and pitiless. I believe that laws and manners were\n      always harsh and cruel to the unfortunate.\"",
                "Between La Roche and Dijon they took breakfast in the dining-car, and left\n      Choulette in it, alone with his pipe, his glass of benedictine, and his\n      irritation.",
                "In the carriage, Madame Marmet talked with peaceful tenderness of the\n      husband she had lost. He had married her for love; he had written\n      admirable verses to her, which she had kept, and never shown to any one.\n      He was lively and very gay. One would not have thought it who had seen him\n      later, tired by work and weakened by illness. He studied until the last\n      moment. Two hours before he died he was trying to read again. He was\n      affectionate and kind. Even in suffering he retained all his sweetness.\n      Madame Martin said to her:",
                "\"You have had long years of happiness; you have kept the reminiscence of\n      them; that is a share of happiness in this world.\"",
                "But good Madame Marmet sighed; a cloud passed over her quiet brow.",
                "\"Yes,\" she said, \"Louis was the best of men and the best of husbands. Yet\n      he made me very miserable. He had only one fault, but I suffered from it\n      cruelly. He was jealous. Good, kind, tender, and generous as he was, this\n      horrible passion made him unjust, ironical, and violent. I can assure you\n      that my behavior gave not the least cause for suspicion. I was not a\n      coquette. But I was young, fresh; I passed for beautiful. That was enough.\n      He would not let me go out alone, and would not let me receive calls in\n      his absence. Whenever we went to a reception, I trembled in advance with\n      the fear of the scene which he would make later in the carriage.\"",
                "And the good Madame Marmet added, with a sigh:",
                "\"It is true that I liked to dance. But I had to renounce going to balls;\n      it made him suffer too much.\"",
                "Countess Martin expressed astonishment. She had always imagined Marmet as\n      an old man, timid, and absorbed by his thoughts; a little ridiculous,\n      between his wife, plump, white, and amiable, and the skeleton wearing a\n      helmet of bronze and gold. But the excellent widow confided to her that,\n      at fifty-five years of age, when she was fifty-three, Louis was just as\n      jealous as on the first day of their marriage.",
                "And Therese thought that Robert had never tormented her with jealousy. Was\n      it on his part a proof of tact and good taste, a mark of confidence, or\n      was it that he did not love her enough to make her suffer? She did not\n      know, and she did not have the heart to try to know. She would have to\n      look through recesses of her mind which she preferred not to open.",
                "She murmured carelessly:",
                "\"We long to be loved, and when we are loved we are tormented or worried.\"",
                "The day was finished in reading and thinking. Choulette did not reappear.\n      Night covered little by little with its gray clouds the mulberry-trees of\n      the Dauphine. Madame Marmet went to sleep peacefully, resting on herself\n      as on a mass of pillows. Therese looked at her and thought:",
                "\"She is happy, since she likes to remember.\"",
                "The sadness of night penetrated her heart. And when the moon rose on the\n      fields of olive-trees, seeing the soft lines of plains and of hills pass,\n      Therese, in this landscape wherein everything spoke of peace and oblivion,\n      and nothing spoke of her, regretted the Seine, the Arc de Triomphe with\n      its radiating avenues, and the alleys of the park where, at least, the\n      trees and the stones knew her.",
                "Suddenly Choulette threw himself into the carriage. Armed with his knotty\n      stick, his face and head enveloped in red wool and a fur cap, he almost\n      frightened her. It was what he wished to do. His violent attitudes and his\n      savage dress were studied. Always seeking to produce effects, it pleased\n      him to seem frightful.",
                "He was a coward himself, and was glad to inspire the fears he often felt.\n      A moment before, as he was smoking his pipe, he had felt, while seeing the\n      moon swallowed up by the clouds, one of those childish frights that\n      tormented his light mind. He had come near the Countess to be reassured.",
                "\"Arles,\" he said. \"Do you know Arles? It is a place of pure beauty. I have\n      seen, in the cloister, doves resting on the shoulders of statues, and I\n      have seen the little gray lizards warming themselves in the sun on the\n      tombs. The tombs are now in two rows on the road that leads to the church.\n      They are formed like cisterns, and serve as beds for the poor at night.\n      One night, when I was walking among them, I met a good old woman who was\n      placing dried herbs in the tomb of an old maid who had died on her\n      wedding-day. We said goodnight to her. She replied: 'May God hear-you! but\n      fate wills that this tomb should open on the side of the northwest wind.\n      If only it were open on the other side, I should be lying as comfortably\n      as Queen Jeanne.'\"",
                "Therese made no answer. She was dozing. And Choulette shivered in the cold\n      of the night, in the fear of death."

                "In her English cart, which she drove herself, Miss Bell had brought over\n      the hills, from the railway station at Florence, the Countess\n      Martin-Belleme and Madame Marmet to her pink-tinted house at Fiesole,\n      which, crowned with a long balustrade, overlooked the incomparable city.\n      The maid followed with the luggage. Choulette, lodged, by Miss Bell's\n      attention, in the house of a sacristan's widow, in the shadow of the\n      cathedral of Fiesole, was not expected until dinner. Plain and gentle,\n      wearing short hair, a waistcoat, a man's shirt on a chest like a boy's,\n      almost graceful, with small hips, the poetess was doing for her French\n      friends the honors of the house, which reflected the ardent delicacy of\n      her taste. On the walls of the drawing-room were pale Virgins, with long\n      hands, reigning peacefully among angels, patriarchs, and saints in\n      beautiful gilded frames. On a pedestal stood a Magdalena, clothed only\n      with her hair, frightful with thinness and old age, some beggar of the\n      road to Pistoia, burned by the suns and the snows, whom some unknown\n      precursor of Donatello had moulded. And everywhere were Miss Bell's chosen\n      arms-bells and cymbals. The largest lifted their bronze clappers at the\n      angles of the room; others formed a chain at the foot of the walls.\n      Smaller ones ran along the cornices. There were bells over the hearth, on\n      the cabinets, and on the chairs. The shelves were full of silver and\n      golden bells. There were big bronze bells marked with the Florentine lily;\n      bells of the Renaissance, representing a lady wearing a white gown; bells\n      of the dead, decorated with tears and bones; bells covered with symbolical\n      animals and leaves, which had rung in the churches in the time of St.\n      Louis; table-bells of the seventeenth century, having a statuette for a\n      handle; the flat, clear cow-bells of the Ruth Valley; Hindu bells; Chinese\n      bells formed like cylinders -- they had come from all countries and all\n      times, at the magic call of little Miss Bell.",
                "\"You look at my speaking arms,\" she said to Madame Martin. \"I think that\n      all these Misses Bell are pleased to be here, and I should not be\n      astonished if some day they all began to sing together. But you must not\n      admire them all equally. Reserve your purest and most fervent praise for\n      this one.\"",
                "And striking with her finger a dark, bare bell which gave a faint sound:",
                "\"This one,\" she said, \"is a holy village-bell of the fifth century. She is\n      a spiritual daughter of Saint Paulin de Nole, who was the first to make\n      the sky sing over our heads. The metal is rare. Soon I will show to you a\n      gentle Florentine, the queen of bells. She is coming. But I bore you,\n      darling, with my babble. And I bore, too, the good Madame Marmet. It is\n      wrong.\"",
                "She escorted them to their rooms.",
                "An hour later, Madame Martin, rested, fresh, in a gown of foulard and\n      lace, went on the terrace where Miss Bell was waiting for her. The humid\n      air, warmed by the sun, exhaled the restless sweetness of spring. Therese,\n      resting on the balustrade, bathed her eyes in the light. At her feet, the\n      cypress-trees raised their black distaffs, and the olive-trees looked like\n      sheep on the hills. In the valley, Florence extended its domes, its\n      towers, and the multitudes of its red roofs, through which the Arno showed\n      its undulating line. Beyond were the soft blue hills.",
                "She tried to recognize the Boboli Gardens, where she had walked at her\n      first visit; the Cascine, which she did not like; the Pitti Palace. Then\n      the charming infinity of the sky attracted her. She looked at the forms in\n      the clouds.",
                "After a long silence, Vivian Bell extended her hand toward the horizon.",
                "\"Darling, I do not know how to say what I wish. But look, darling, look\n      again. What you see there is unique in the world. Nature is nowhere else\n      so subtle, elegant, and fine. The god who made the hills of Florence was\n      an artist. Oh, he was a jeweller, an engraver, a sculptor, a\n      bronze-founder, and a painter; he was a Florentine. He did nothing else in\n      the world, darling. The rest was made by a hand less delicate, whose work\n      was less perfect. How can you think that that violet hill of San Miniato,\n      so firm and so pure in relief, was made by the author of Mont Blanc? It is\n      not possible. This landscape has the beauty of an antique medal and of a\n      precious painting. It is a perfect and measured work of art. And here is\n      another thing that I do not know how to say, that I can not even\n      understand, but which is a real thing. In this country I feel -- and\n      you will feel as I do, darling -- half alive and half dead; in a\n      condition which is sad, noble, and very sweet. Look, look again; you will\n      realize the melancholy of those hills that surround Florence, and see a\n      delicious sadness ascend from the land of the dead.\"",
                "The sun was low over the horizon. The bright points of the mountain-peaks\n      faded one by one, while the clouds inflamed the sky. Madame Marmet\n      sneezed.",
                "Miss Bell sent for some shawls, and warned the French women that the\n      evenings were fresh and that the night-air was dangerous.",
                "Then suddenly she said:",
                "\"Darling, you know Monsieur Jacques Dechartre? Well, he wrote to me that\n      he would be at Florence next week. I am glad Monsieur Jacques Dechartre is\n      to meet you in our city. He will accompany us to the churches and to the\n      museums, and he will be a good guide. He understands beautiful things,\n      because he loves them. And he has an exquisite talent as a sculptor. His\n      figures in medallions are admired more in England than in France.

The Florentine\n      cobbler listened with a kind smile. He was a little, bald man, and\n      represented one of the types familiar to Flemish painters. On a table,\n      among wooden lasts, nails, leather, and wax, a basilic plant displayed its\n      round green head. A sparrow, lacking a leg, which had been replaced by a\n      match, hopped on the old man's shoulder and head.",
                "Madame Martin, amused by this spectacle, called Choulette from the\n      threshold. He was softly humming a tune, and she asked him why he had not\n      gone with her to visit the Spanish chapel.",

I will go again to his shop;\n      I will learn from him how to make shoes, and how to live without desire.\n      After which, I shall not be sad again. For desire and idleness alone make\n      us sad.\"",
                "The Countess Martin smiled.",

                "Choulette replied, gravely:",
                "\"It is not yet time for that.\"",
                "When they reached the gardens of the Oricellari, Madame Marmet sank on a\n      bench. She had examined at Santa Maria-Novella the frescoes of\n      Ghirlandajo, the stalls of the choir, the Virgin of Cimabue, the paintings\n      in the cloister. She had done this carefully, in memory of her husband,\n      who had greatly liked Italian art. She was tired. Choulette sat by her and\n      said:",
                "\"Madame, could you tell me whether it is true that the Pope's gowns are\n      made by Worth?\"",
                "Madame Marmet thought not. Nevertheless, Choulette had heard people say\n      this in cafes. Madame Marmet was astonished that Choulette, a Catholic and\n      a socialist, should speak so disrespectfully of a pope friendly to the\n      republic. But he did not like Leo XIII.",
                "\"The wisdom of princes is shortsighted,\" he said; \"the salvation of the\n      Church must come from the Italian republic, as Leo XIII believes and\n      wishes; but the Church will not be saved in the manner which this pious\n      Machiavelli thinks. The revolution will make the Pope lose his last sou,\n      with the rest of his patrimony. And it will be salvation. The Pope,\n      destitute and poor, will then become powerful. He will agitate the world.\n      We shall see again Peter, Lin, Clet, Anaclet, and Clement; the humble, the\n      ignorant; men like the early saints will change the face of the earth. If\n      to-morrow, in the chair of Peter, came to sit a real bishop, a real\n      Christian, I would go to him, and say: 'Do not be an old man buried alive\n      in a golden tomb; quit your noble guards and your cardinals; quit your\n      court and its similacrums of power. Take my arm and come with me to beg\n      for your bread among the nations. Covered with rags, poor, ill, dying, go\n      on the highways, showing in yourself the image of Jesus. Say, \"I am\n      begging my bread for the condemnation of the wealthy.\" Go into the cities,\n      and shout from door to door, with a sublime stupidity, \"Be humble, be\n      gentle, be poor!\" Announce peace and charity to the cities, to the dens,\n      and to the barracks. You will be disdained; the mob will throw stones at\n      you. Policemen will drag you into prison. You shall be for the humble as\n      for the powerful, for the poor as for the rich, a subject of laughter, an\n      object of disgust and of pity. Your priests will dethrone you, and elevate\n      against you an anti-pope, or will say that you are crazy. And it is\n      necessary that they should tell the truth; it is necessary that you should\n      be crazy; the lunatics have saved the world. Men will give to you the\n      crown of thorns and the reed sceptre, and they will spit in your face, and\n      it is by that sign that you will appear as Christ and true king; and it is\n      by such means that you will establish Christian socialism, which is the\n      kingdom of God on earth.'\"",
                "Having spoken in this way, Choulette lighted one of those long and\n      tortuous Italian cigars, which are pierced with a straw. He drew from it\n      several puffs of infectious vapor, then he continued, tranquilly:",
                "\"And it would be practical. You may refuse to acknowledge any quality in\n      me except my clear view of situations. Ah, Madame Marmet, you will never\n      know how true it is that the great works of this world were always\n      achieved by madmen. Do you think, Madame Martin, that if Saint Francis of\n      Assisi had been reasonable, he would have poured upon the earth, for the\n      refreshment of peoples, the living water of charity and all the perfumes\n      of love?\"",

All his\n      ills came to attack him at once: the humidity in the air gave him a pain\n      in the knee, and he could not bend his leg; his carpet-bag, lost the day\n      before in the trip from the station to Fiesole, had not been found, and it\n      was an irreparable disaster; a Paris review had just published one of his\n      poems, with typographical errors as glaring as Aphrodite's shell.",
                "He accused men and things of being hostile to him. He became puerile,\n      absurd, odious. Madame Martin, whom Choulette and the rain saddened,\n      thought the trip would never end. When she reached the house she found\n      Miss Bell in the drawing-room, copying with gold ink on a leaf of\n      parchment, in a handwriting formed after the Aldine italics, verses which\n      she had composed in the night.

She led all her ideas back to her little\n      circle of academicians and fashionable people, by an easy turn, which\n      irritated her friend. She recalled in her soft voice the public meetings\n      at the Institute, the lectures at the Sorbonne, the evening receptions\n      where shone the worldly and the spiritualist philosophers. As for the\n      women, they were all charming and irreproachable. She dined with all of\n      them. And Therese thought: \"She is too prudent. She bores me.\" And she\n      thought of leaving her at Fiesole and visiting the churches alone.\n      Employing a word that Le Menil had taught her, she said to herself:",
                "\"I will 'plant' Madame Marmet.\"",
                "A lithe old man came into the parlor. His waxed moustache and his white\n      imperial made him look like an old soldier; but his glance betrayed, under\n      his glasses, the fine softness of eyes worn by science and voluptuousness.\n      He was a Florentine, a friend of Miss Bell and of the Prince, Professor\n      Arrighi, formerly adored by women, and now celebrated in Tuscany for his\n      studies of agriculture. He pleased the Countess Martin at once. She\n      questioned him on his methods, and on the results he obtained from them.\n      He said that he worked with prudent energy. \"The earth,\" he said, \"is like\n      women. The earth does not wish one to treat it with either timidity or\n      brutality.\" The Ave Maria rang in all the campaniles, seeming to make of\n      the sky an immense instrument of religious music. \"Darling,\" said Miss\n      Bell, \"do you observe that the air of Florence is made sonorous and\n      silvery at night by the sound of the bells?\"",
                "\"It is singular,\" said Choulette, \"we have the air of people who are\n      waiting for something.\"",
                "Vivian Bell replied that they were waiting for M. Dechartre. He was a\n      little late; she feared he had missed the train.",
                "Choulette approached Madame Marmet, and said, gravely \"Madame Marmet, is\n      it possible for you to look at a door -- a simple, painted, wooden door\n      like yours, I suppose, or like mine, or like this one, or like any other -- without\n      being terror-stricken at the thought of the visitor who might, at any\n      moment, come in? The door of one's room, Madame Marmet, opens on the\n      infinite. Have you ever thought of that? Does one ever know the true name\n      of the man or woman, who, under a human guise, with a known face, in\n      ordinary clothes, comes into one's house?\"",
                "He added that when he was closeted in his room he could not look at the\n      door without feeling his hair stand on end. But Madame Marmet saw the\n      doors of her rooms open without fear. She knew the name of every one who\n      came to see her -- charming persons.",
                "Choulette looked at her sadly, and said, shaking his head: \"Madame Marmet,\n      those whom you call by their terrestrial names have other names which you\n      do not know, and which are their real names.\"",
                "Madame Martin asked Choulette if he thought that misfortune needed to\n      cross the threshold in order to enter one's life.",
                "\"Misfortune is ingenious and subtle. It comes by the window, it goes\n      through walls. It does not always show itself, but it is always there. The\n      poor doors are innocent of the coming of that unwelcome visitor.\"",
                "Choulette warned Madame Martin severely that she should not call\n      misfortune an unwelcome visitor.",
                "\"Misfortune is our greatest master and our best friend. Misfortune teaches\n      us the meaning of life. Madame, when you suffer, you know what you must\n      know; you believe what you must believe; you do what you must do; you are\n      what you must be. And you shall have joy, which pleasure expels. True joy\n      is timid, and does not find pleasure among a multitude.\"",
                "Prince Albertinelli said that Miss Bell and her French friends did not\n      need to be unfortunate in order to be perfect, and that the doctrine of\n      perfection reached by suffering was a barbarous cruelty, held in horror\n      under the beautiful sky of Italy. When the conversation languished, he\n      prudently sought again at the piano the phrases of the graceful and banal\n      Sicilian air, fearing to slip into an air of Trovatore, which was written\n      in the same manner.",
                "Vivian Bell questioned the monsters she had created, and complained of\n      their absurd replies.",
                "\"At this moment,\" she said, \"I should like to hear speak only figures on\n      tapestries which should say tender things, ancient and precious as\n      themselves.\"",
                "And the handsome Prince, carried away by the flood of melody, sang. His\n      voice displayed itself like a peacock's plumage, and died in spasms of\n      \"ohs\" and \"ahs.\"",
                "The good Madame Marmet, her eyes fixed on the door, said:",
                "\"I think that Monsieur Dechartre is coming.\"",
                "He came in, animated, with joy on his usually grave face.",
                "Miss Bell welcomed him with birdlike cries.",
                "\"Monsieur Dechartre, we were impatient to see you. Monsieur Choulette was\n      talking evil of doors -- yes, of doors of houses; and he was saying\n      also that misfortune is a very obliging old gentleman. You have lost all\n      these beautiful things. You have made us wait very long, Monsieur\n      Dechartre. Why?\"",
                "He apologized; he had taken only the time to go to his hotel and change\n      his dress. He had not even gone to bow to his old friend the bronze San\n      Marco, so imposing in his niche on the San Michele wall. He praised the\n      poetess and saluted the Countess Martin with joy hardly concealed.",
                "\"Before quitting Paris I went to your house, where I was told you had gone\n      to wait for spring at Fiesole, with Miss Bell. I then had the hope of\n      finding you in this country, which I love now more than ever.\"",
                "She asked him whether he had gone to Venice, and whether he had seen again\n      at Ravenna the empresses wearing aureolas, and the phantoms that had\n      formerly dazzled him.",
                "No, he had not stopped anywhere.",
                "She said nothing. Her eyes remained fixed on the corner of the wall, on\n      the St. Paulin bell.",
                "He said to her:",
                "\"You are looking at the Nolette.\"",
                "Vivian Bell laid aside her papers and her pencils.",
                "\"You shall soon see a marvel, Monsieur Dechartre. I have found the queen\n      of small bells. I found it at Rimini, in an old building in ruins, which\n      is used as a warehouse. I bought it and packed it myself. I am waiting for\n      it. You shall see. It bears a Christ on a cross, between the Virgin and\n      Saint John, the date of 1400, and the arms of Malatesta -- Monsieur\n      Dechartre, you are not listening enough. Listen to me attentively. In 1400\n      Lorenzo Ghiberti, fleeing from war and the plague, took refuge at Rimini,\n      at Paola Malatesta's house. It was he that modelled the figures of my\n      bell. And you shall see here, next week, Ghiberti's work.\"",
                "The servant announced that dinner was served.",
                "Miss Bell apologized for serving to them Italian dishes. Her cook was a\n      poet of Fiesole.",
                "At table, before the fiascani enveloped with corn straw, they talked of\n      the fifteenth century, which they loved. Prince Albertinelli praised the\n      artists of that epoch for their universality, for the fervent love they\n      gave to their art, and for the genius that devoured them. He talked with\n      emphasis, in a caressing voice.",
                "Dechartre admired them. But he admired them in another way.",
                "\"To praise in a becoming manner,\" he said, \"those men, who worked so\n      heartily, the praise should be modest and just. They should be placed in\n      their workshops, in the shops where they worked as artisans. It is there\n      that one may admire their simplicity and their genius. They were ignorant\n      and rude. They had read little and seen little. The hills that surround\n      Florence were the boundary of their horizon. They knew only their city,\n      the Holy Scriptures, and some fragments of antique sculptures, studied and\n      caressed lovingly.\"",
                "\"You are right,\" said Professor Arrighi. \"They had no other care than to\n      use the best processes. Their minds bent only on preparing varnish and\n      mixing colors. The one who first thought of pasting a canvas on a panel,\n      in order that the painting should not be broken when the wood was split,\n      passed for a marvellous man. Every master had his secret formulae.\"",
                "\"Happy time,\" said Dechartre, \"when nobody troubled himself about that\n      originality for which we are so avidly seeking to-day. The apprentice\n      tried to work like the master. He had no other ambition than to resemble\n      him, and it was without trying to be that he was different from the\n      others. They worked not for glory, but to live.\"",
                "\"They were right,\" said Choulette. \"Nothing is better than to work for a\n      living.\"",
                "\"The desire to attain fame,\" continued Dechartre, \"did not trouble them.\n      As they did not know the past, they did not conceive the future; and their\n      dream did not go beyond their lives. They exercised a powerful will in\n      working well. Being simple, they made few mistakes, and saw the truth\n      which our intelligence conceals from us.\"",
                "Choulette began to relate to Madame Marmet the incidents of a call he had\n      made during the day on the Princess of the House of France to whom the\n      Marquise de Rieu had given him a letter of introduction. He liked to\n      impress upon people the fact that he, the Bohemian and vagabond, had been\n      received by that royal Princess, at whose house neither Miss Bell nor the\n      Countess Martin would have been admitted, and whom Prince Albertinelli\n      prided himself on having met one day at some ceremony.",
                "\"She devotes herself,\" said the Prince, \"to the practices of piety.\"",
                "\"She is admirable for her nobility, and her simplicity,\" said Choulette.\n      \"In her house, surrounded by her gentlemen and her ladies, she causes the\n      most rigorous etiquette to be observed, so that her grandeur is almost a\n      penance, and every morning she scrubs the pavement of the church. It is a\n      village church, where the chickens roam, while the 'cure' plays briscola\n      with the sacristan.\"",
                "And Choulette, bending over the table, imitated, with his napkin, a\n      servant scrubbing; then, raising his head, he said, gravely:",
                "\"After waiting in consecutive anterooms, I was at last permitted to kiss\n      her hand.\"",
                "And he stopped.",
                "Madame Martin asked, impatiently:",
                "\"What did she say to you, that Princess so admirable for her nobility and\n      her simplicity?\"",
                "\"She said to me: 'Have you visited Florence? I am told that recently new\n      and handsome shops have been opened which are lighted at night.' She said\n      also 'We have a good chemist here. The Austrian chemists are not better.\n      He placed on my leg, six months ago, a porous plaster which has not yet\n      come off.' Such are the words that Maria Therese deigned to address to me.\n      O simple grandeur! O Christian virtue! O daughter of Saint Louis! O\n      marvellous echo of your voice, holy Elizabeth of Hungary!\"",
                "Madame Martin smiled. She thought that Choulette was mocking. But he\n      denied the charge, indignantly, and Miss Bell said that Madame Martin was\n      wrong. It was a fault of the French, she said, to think that people were\n      always jesting.",
                "Then they reverted to the subject of art, which in that country is inhaled\n      with the air.",
                "\"As for me,\" said the Countess Martin, \"I am not learned enough to admire\n      Giotto and his school. What strikes me is the sensuality of that art of\n      the fifteenth century which is said to be Christian. I have seen piety and\n      purity only in the images of Fra Angelico, although they are very pretty.\n      The rest, those figures of Virgins and angels, are voluptuous, caressing,\n      and at times perversely ingenuous. What is there religious in those young\n      Magian kings, handsome as women; in that Saint Sebastian, brilliant with\n      youth, who seems merely the dolorous Bacchus of Christianity?\"",
                "Dechartre replied that he thought as she did, and that they must be right,\n      she and he; since Savonarola was of the same opinion, and, finding no\n      piety in any work of art, wished to burn them all.",
                "\"There were at Florence, in the time of the superb Manfred, who was half a\n      Mussulman, men who were said to be of the sect of Epicurus, and who sought\n      for arguments against the existence of God. Guido Cavalcanti disdained the\n      ignorant folk who believed in the immortality of the soul. The following\n      phrase by him was quoted: 'The death of man is exactly similar to that of\n      brutes.' Later, when antique beauty was excavated from ruins, the\n      Christian style of art seemed sad. The painters that worked in the\n      churches and cloisters were neither devout nor chaste. Perugino was an\n      atheist, and did not conceal it.\"",
                "\"Yes,\" said Miss Bell; \"but it was said that his head was hard, and that\n      celestial truths, could not penetrate his thick cranium. He was harsh and\n      avaricious, and quite embedded in material interests. He thought only of\n      buying houses.\"",
                "Professor Arrighi defended Pietro Vanucci of Perugia.",
                "\"He was,\" he said, \"an honest man. And the prior of the Gesuati of\n      Florence was wrong to mistrust him. That monk practised the art of\n      manufacturing ultramarine blue by crushing stones of burned lapis-lazuli.\n      Ultramarine was then worth its weight in gold; and the prior, who\n      doubtless had a secret, esteemed it more precious than rubies or\n      sapphires. He asked Pietro Vanucci to decorate the two cloisters of his\n      convent, and he expected marvels, less from the skilfulness of the master\n      than from the beauty of that ultramarine in the skies. During all the time\n      that the painter worked in the cloisters at the history of Jesus Christ,\n      the prior kept by his side and presented to him the precious powder in a\n      bag which he never quitted. Pietro took from it, under the saintly man's\n      eyes, the quantity he needed, and dipped his brush, loaded with color, in\n      a cupful of water, before rubbing the wall with it. He used in that manner\n      a great quantity of the powder. And the good father, seeing his bag\n      getting thinner, sighed: 'Jesus! How that lime devours the ultramarine!' \n      When the frescoes were finished, and Perugino had received from the monk\n      the agreed price, he placed in his hand a package of blue powder: 'This is\n      for you, father. Your ultramarine which I took with my brush fell to the\n      bottom of my cup, whence I gathered it every day. I return it to you.\n      Learn to trust honest people.\"",
                "\"Oh,\" said Therese, \"there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that\n      Perugino was avaricious yet honest. Interested people are not always the\n      least scrupulous. There are many misers who are honest.\"",
                "\"Naturally, darling,\" said Miss Bell. \"Misers do not wish to owe anything,\n      and prodigal people can bear to have debts. They do not think of the money\n      they have, and they think less of the money they owe. I did not say that\n      Pietro Vanucci of Perugia was a man without property. I said that he had a\n      hard business head and that he bought houses. I am very glad to hear that\n      he returned the ultramarine to the prior of the Gesuati.\"",
                "\"Since your Pietro was rich,\" said Choulette, \"it was his duty to return\n      the ultramarine. The rich are morally bound to be honest; the poor are\n      not.\"",
                "At this moment, Choulette, to whom the waiter was presenting a silver\n      bowl, extended his hands for the perfumed water. It came from a vase which\n      Miss Bell passed to her guests, in accordance with antique usage, after\n      meals.",
                "\"I wash my hands,\" he said, \"of the evil that Madame Martin does or may do\n      by her speech, or otherwise.\"",
                "And he rose, awkwardly, after Miss Bell, who took the arm of Professor\n      Arrighi.",
                "In the drawing-room she said, while serving the coffee:",
                "\"Monsieur Choulette, why do you condemn us to the savage sadness of\n      equality? Why, Daphnis's flute would not be melodious if it were made of\n      seven equal reeds. You wish to destroy the beautiful harmonies between\n      masters and servants, aristocrats and artisans. Oh, I fear you are a sad\n      barbarian, Monsieur Choulette. You are full of pity for those who are in\n      need, and you have no pity for divine beauty, which you exile from this\n      world. You expel beauty, Monsieur Choulette; you repudiate her, nude and\n      in tears. Be certain of this: she will not remain on earth when the poor\n      little men shall all be weak, delicate, and ignorant. Believe me, to\n      abolish the ingenious grouping which men of diverse conditions form in\n      society, the humble with the magnificent, is to be the enemy of the poor\n      and of the rich, is to be the enemy of the human race.\"",
                "\"Enemies of the human race!\" replied Choulette, while stirring his coffee.\n      \"That is the phrase the harsh Roman applied to the Christians who talked\n      of divine love to him.\"",
                "Dechartre, seated near Madame Martin, questioned her on her tastes about\n      art and beauty, sustained, led, animated her admirations, at times\n      prompted her with caressing brusquerie, wished her to see all that he had\n      seen, to love all that he loved.",
                "He wished that she should go in the gardens at the first flush of spring.\n      He contemplated her in advance on the noble terraces; he saw already the\n      light playing on her neck and in her hair; the shadow of laurel-trees\n      falling on her eyes. For him the land and the sky of Florence had nothing\n      more to do than to serve as an adornment to this young woman.",
                "He praised the simplicity with which she dressed, the characteristics of\n      her form and of her grace, the charming frankness of the lines which every\n      one of her movements created. He liked, he said, the animated and living,\n      subtle, and free gowns which one sees so rarely, which one never forgets.",
                "Although she had been much lauded, she had never heard praise which had\n      pleased her more. She knew she dressed well, with bold and sure taste. But\n      no man except her father had made to her on the subject the compliments of\n      an expert. She thought that men were capable of feeling only the effect of\n      a gown, without understanding the ingenious details of it. Some men who\n      knew gowns disgusted her by their effeminate air. She was resigned to the\n      appreciation of women only, and these had in their appreciation narrowness\n      of mind, malignity, and envy. The artistic admiration of Dechartre\n      astonished and pleased her. She received agreeably the praise he gave her,\n      without thinking that perhaps it was too intimate and almost indiscreet.",
                "\"So you look at gowns, Monsieur Dechartre?\"",
                "No, he seldom looked at them. There were so few women well dressed, even\n      now, when women dress as well as, and even better, than ever. He found no\n      pleasure in seeing packages of dry-goods walk. But if a woman having\n      rhythm and line passed before him, he blessed her.",
                "He continued, in a tone a little more elevated:",
                "\"I can not think of a woman who takes care to deck herself every day,\n      without meditating on the great lesson which she gives to artists. She\n      dresses for a few hours, and the care she has taken is not lost. We must,\n      like her, ornament life without thinking of the future. To paint, carve,\n      or write for posterity is only the silliness of conceit.\"",
                "\"Monsieur Dechartre,\" asked Prince Albertinelli, \"how do you think a mauve\n      waist studded with silver flowers would become Miss Bell?\"",
                "\"I think,\" said Choulette, \"so little of a terrestrial future, that I have\n      written my finest poems on cigarette paper. They vanished easily, leaving\n      to my verses only a sort of metaphysical existence.\"",
                "He had an air of negligence for which he posed. In fact, he had never lost\n      a line of his writing. Dechartre was more sincere. He was not desirous of\n      immortality. Miss Bell reproached him for this.",
                "\"Monsieur Dechartre, that life may be great and complete, one must put\n      into it the past and the future. Our works of poetry and of art must be\n      accomplished in honor of the dead and with the thought of those who are to\n      come after us. Thus we shall participate in what has been, in what is, and\n      in what shall be. You do not wish to be immortal, Monsieur Dechartre?\n      Beware, for God may hear you.\"",

                "She thought he had a charming imagination, a mind richer than all those\n      that had been revealed to her, and an attraction which she no longer tried\n      to resist. She had always recognized his gift to please. She discovered\n      now that he had the will to please. This idea was delightful to her; she\n      closed her eyes to retain it. Then, suddenly, she shuddered. She had felt\n      a deep blow struck within her in the depth of her being. She had a sudden\n      vision of Robert, his gun under his arm, in the woods. He walked with firm\n      and regular step in the shadowy thicket. She could not see his face, and\n      that troubled her. She bore him no ill-will. She was not discontented with\n      him, but with herself. Robert went straight on, without turning his head,\n      far, and still farther, until he was only a black point in the desolate\n      wood. She thought that perhaps she had been capricious and harsh in\n      leaving him without a word of farewell, without even a letter. He was her\n      lover and her only friend. She never had had another. \"I do not wish him\n      to be unfortunate because of me,\" she thought.",
                "Little by little she was reassured. He loved her, doubtless; but he was\n      not susceptible, not ingenious, happily, in tormenting himself. She said\n      to herself:",
                "\"He is hunting and enjoying the sport. He is with his aunt, whom he\n      admires.\" She calmed her fears and returned to the charming gayety of\n      Florence. She had seen casually, at the Offices, a picture that Dechartre\n      liked. It was a decapitated head of the Medusa, a work wherein Leonardo,\n      the sculptor said, had expressed the minute profundity and tragic\n      refinement of his genius. She wished to see it again, regretting that she\n      had not seen it better at first. She extinguished her lamp and went to\n      sleep.",
                "She dreamed that she met in a deserted church Robert Le Menil enveloped in\n      furs which she had never seen him wear. He was waiting for her, but a\n      crowd of priests had separated them. She did not know what had become of\n      him. She had not seen his face, and that frightened her. She awoke and\n      heard at the open window a sad, monotonous cry, and saw a humming-bird\n      darting about in the light of early dawn. Then, without cause, she began\n      to weep in a passion of self-pity, and with the abandon of a child."

                "She took pleasure in dressing early, with delicate and subtle taste. Her\n      dressing-room, an aesthetic fantasy of Vivian Bell, with its coarsely\n      varnished pottery, its tall copper pitchers, and its faience pavement,\n      like a chess-board, resembled a fairy's kitchen. It was rustic and\n      marvellous, and the Countess Martin could have in it the agreeable\n      surprise of mistaking herself for a fairy. While her maid was dressing her\n      hair, she heard Dechartre and Choulette talking under her windows. She\n      rearranged all the work Pauline had done, and uncovered the line of her\n      nape, which was fine and pure. She looked at herself in the glass, and\n      went into the garden.",
                "Dechartre was there, reciting verses of Dante, and looking at Florence:\n      \"At the hour when our mind, a greater stranger to the flesh...\"",
                "Near him, Choulette, seated on the balustrade of the terrace, his legs\n      hanging, and his nose in his beard, was still at work on the figure of\n      Misery on his stick.",
                "Dechartre resumed the rhymes of the canticle: \"At the hour when our mind,\n      a greater stranger to the flesh; and less under the obsession of thoughts,\n      is almost divine in its visions,...\"",
                "She approached beside the boxwood hedge, holding a parasol and dressed in\n      a straw-colored gown. The faint sunlight of winter enveloped her in pale\n      gold.",
                "Dechartre greeted her joyfully.",
                "She said:",
                "\"You are reciting verses that I do not know. I know only Metastasio. My\n      teacher liked only Metastasio. What is the hour when the mind has divine\n      visions?\"",
                "\"Madame, that hour is the dawn of the day. It may be also the dawn of\n      faith and of love.\"",
                "Choulette doubted that the poet meant dreams of the morning, which leave\n      at awakening vivid and painful impressions, and which are not altogether\n      strangers to the flesh. But Dechartre had quoted these verses in the\n      pleasure of the glorious dawn which he had seen that morning on the golden\n      hills. He had been, for a long time, troubled about the images that one\n      sees in sleep, and he believed that these images were not related to the\n      object that preoccupies one the most, but, on the contrary, to ideas\n      abandoned during the day.",
                "Therese recalled her morning dream, the hunter lost in the thicket.",
                "\"Yes,\" said Dechartre, \"the things we see at night are unfortunate remains\n      of what we have neglected the day before. Dreams avenge things one has\n      disdained. They are reproaches of abandoned friends. Hence their sadness.\"",
                "She was lost in dreams for a moment, then she said:",
                "\"That is perhaps true.\"",
                "Then, quickly, she asked Choulette if he had finished the portrait of\n      Misery on his stick. Misery had now become a figure of Piety, and\n      Choulette recognized the Virgin in it. He had even composed a quatrain\n      which he was to write on it in spiral form -- a didactic and moral\n      quatrain. He would cease to write, except in the style of the commandments\n      of God rendered into French verses. The four lines expressed simplicity\n      and goodness. He consented to recite them.",
                "Therese rested on the balustrade of the terrace and sought in the\n      distance, in the depth of the sea of light, the peaks of Vallambrosa,\n      almost as blue as the sky. Jacques Dechartre looked at her. It seemed to\n      him that he saw her for the first time, such was the delicacy that he\n      discovered in her face, which tenderness and intelligence had invested\n      with thoughtfulness without altering its young, fresh grace. The daylight\n      which she liked, was indulgent to her. And truly she was pretty, bathed in\n      that light of Florence, which caresses beautiful forms and feeds noble\n      thoughts. A fine, pink color rose to her well-rounded cheeks; her eyes,\n      bluish-gray, laughed; and when she talked, the brilliancy of her teeth set\n      off her lips of ardent sweetness. His look embraced her supple bust, her\n      full hips, and the bold attitude of her waist. She held her parasol with\n      her left hand, the other hand played with violets. Dechartre had a mania\n      for beautiful hands. Hands presented to his eyes a physiognomy as striking\n      as the face -- a character, a soul. These hands enchanted him. They\n      were exquisite. He adored their slender fingers, their pink nails, their\n      palms soft and tender, traversed by lines as elegant as arabesques, and\n      rising at the base of the fingers in harmonious mounts. He examined them\n      with charmed attention until she closed them on the handle of her\n      umbrella. Then, standing behind her, he looked at her again. Her bust and\n      arms, graceful and pure in line, her beautiful form, which was like that\n      of a living amphora, pleased him.",
                "\"Monsieur Dechartre, that black spot over there is the Boboli Gardens, is\n      it not? I saw the gardens three years ago. There were not many flowers in\n      them. Nevertheless, I liked their tall, sombre trees.\"",
                "It astonished him that she talked, that she thought. The clear sound of\n      her voice amazed him, as if he never had heard it.",
                "He replied at random. He was awkward. She feigned not to notice it, but\n      felt a deep inward joy. His low voice, which was veiled and softened,\n      seemed to caress her. She said ordinary things:",

                "In the morning, her head on the embroidered pillow, Therese was thinking\n      of the walks of the day before; of the Virgins, framed with angels; of the\n      innumerable children, painted or carved, all beautiful, all happy, who\n      sing ingenuously the Alleluia of grace and of beauty. In the illustrious\n      chapel of the Brancacci, before those frescoes, pale and resplendent as a\n      divine dawn, he had talked to her of Masaccio, in language so vivid that\n      it had seemed to her as if she had seen him, the adolescent master of the\n      masters, his mouth half open, his eyes dark and blue, dying, enchanted.\n      And she had liked these marvels of a morning more charming than a day.\n      Dechartre was for her the soul of those magnificent forms, the mind of\n      those noble things. It was by him, it was through him, that she understood\n      art and life. She took no interest in things that did not interest him.\n      How had this affection come to her? She had no precise remembrance of it.\n      In the first place, when Paul Vence wished to introduce him to her, she\n      had no desire to know him, no presentiment that he would please her. She\n      recalled elegant bronze statuettes, fine waxworks signed with his name,\n      that she had remarked at the Champ de Mars salon or at Durand-Ruel's. But\n      she did not imagine that he could be agreeable to her, or more seductive\n      than many artists and lovers of art at whom she laughed with her friends.\n      When she saw him, he pleased her; she had a desire to attract him, to see\n      him often. The night he dined at her house she realized that she had for\n      him a noble and elevating affection. But soon after he irritated her a\n      little; it made her impatient to see him closeted within himself and too\n      little preoccupied by her. She would have liked to disturb him. She was in\n      that state of impatience when she met him one evening, in front of the\n      grille of the Musee des Religions, and he talked to her of Ravenna and of\n      the Empress seated on a gold chair in her tomb. She had found him serious\n      and charming, his voice warm, his eyes soft in the shadow of the night,\n      but too much a stranger, too far from her, too unknown. She had felt a\n      sort of uneasiness, and she did not know, when she walked along the\n      boxwood bordering the terrace, whether she desired to see him every day or\n      never to see him again.",
                "Since then, at Florence, her only pleasure was to feel that he was near\n      her, to hear him. He made life for her charming, diverse, animated, new.\n      He revealed to her delicate joys and a delightful sadness; he awakened in\n      her a voluptuousness which had been always dormant. Now she was determined\n      never to give him up. But how? She foresaw difficulties; her lucid mind\n      and her temperament presented them all to her. For a moment she tried to\n      deceive herself; she reflected that perhaps he, a dreamer, exalted, lost\n      in his studies of art, might remain assiduous without being exacting. But\n      she did not wish to reassure herself with that idea. If Dechartre were not\n      a lover, he lost all his charm. She did not dare to think of the future.\n      She lived in the present, happy, anxious, and closing her eyes.",
                "She was dreaming thus, in the shade traversed by arrows of light, when\n      Pauline brought to her some letters with the morning tea. On an envelope\n      marked with the monogram of the Rue Royale Club she recognized the\n      handwriting of Le Menil. She had expected that letter. She was only\n      astonished that what was sure to come had come, as in her childhood, when\n      the infallible clock struck the hour of her piano lesson.",
                "In his letter Robert made reasonable reproaches. Why did she go without\n      saying anything, without leaving a word of farewell? Since his return to\n      Paris he had expected every morning a letter which had not come. He was\n      happier the year before, when he had received in the morning, two or three\n      times a week, letters so gentle and so well written that he regretted not\n      being able to print them. Anxious, he had gone to her house.",
                "\"I was astounded to hear of your departure. Your husband received me. He\n      said that, yielding to his advice, you had gone to finish the winter at\n      Florence with Miss Bell. He said that for some time you had looked pale\n      and thin. He thought a change of air would do you good. You had not wished\n      to go, but, as you suffered more and more, he succeeded in persuading you.",
                "\"I had not noticed that you were thin. It seemed to me, on the contrary,\n      that your health was good. And then Florence is not a good winter resort.\n      I cannot understand your departure. I am much tormented by it. Reassure me\n      at once, I pray you.",
                "\"Do you think it is agreeable for me to get news of you from your husband\n      and to receive his confidences? He is sorry you are not here; it annoys\n      him that the obligations of public life compel him to remain in Paris. I\n      heard at the club that he had chances to become a minister. This\n      astonishes me, because ministers are not usually chosen among fashionable\n      people.\"",
                "Then he related hunting tales to her. He had brought for her three\n      fox-skins, one of which was very beautiful; the skin of a brave animal\n      which he had pulled by the tail, and which had bitten his hand.",
                "In Paris he was worried. His cousin had been presented at the club. He\n      feared he might be blackballed. His candidacy had been posted. Under these\n      conditions he did not dare advise him to withdraw; it would be taking too\n      great a responsibility. If he were blackballed it would be very\n      disagreeable. He finished by praying her to write and to return soon.",
                "Having read this letter, she tore it up gently, threw it in the fire, and\n      calmly watched it burn.",
                "Doubtless, he was right. He had said what he had to say; he had\n      complained, as it was his duty to complain. What could she answer? Should\n      she continue her quarrel? The subject of it had become so indifferent to\n      her that it needed reflection to recall it. Oh, no; she had no desire to\n      be tormented. She felt, on the contrary, very gentle toward him! Seeing\n      that he loved her with confidence, in stubborn tranquillity, she became\n      sad and frightened. He had not changed. He was the same man he had been\n      before. She was not the same woman. They were separated now by\n      imperceptible yet strong influences, like essences in the air that make\n      one live or die. When her maid came to dress her, she had not begun to\n      write an answer.",
                "Anxious, she thought: \"He trusts me. He suspects nothing.\" This made her\n      more impatient than anything. It irritated her to think that there were\n      simple people who doubt neither themselves nor others.",
                "She went into the parlor, where she found Vivian Bell writing. The latter\n      said:",
                "\"Do you wish to know, darling, what I was doing while waiting for you?\n      Nothing and everything. Verses. Oh, darling, poetry must be our souls\n      naturally expressed.\"",

                "\"Is it a symbol, Vivian? Explain it to me.\"",
                "\"Oh, darling, why explain, why? A poetic image must have several meanings.\n      The one that you find is the real one. But there is a very clear meaning\n      in them, my love; that is, that one should not lightly disengage one's\n      self from what one has taken into the heart.\"",
                "The horses were harnessed. They went, as had been agreed, to visit the\n      Albertinelli gallery. The Prince was waiting for them, and Dechartre was\n      to meet them in the palace. On the way, while the carriage rolled along\n      the wide highway, Vivian Bell talked with her usual transcendentalism. As\n      they were descending among houses pink and white, gardens and terraces\n      ornamented with statues and fountains, she showed to her friend the villa,\n      hidden under bluish pines, where the ladies and the cavaliers of the\n      Decameron took refuge from the plague that ravaged Florence, and diverted\n      one another with tales frivolous, facetious, or tragic. Then she confessed\n      the thought which had come to her the day before.",
                "\"You had gone, darling, to Carmine with Monsieur Dechartre, and you had\n      left at Fiesole Madame Marmet, who is an agreeable person, a moderate and\n      polished woman. She knows many anecdotes about persons of distinction who\n      live in Paris. And when she tells them, she does as my cook Pompaloni does\n      when he serves eggs: he does not put salt in them, but he puts the\n      salt-cellar next to them. Madame Marmet's tongue is very sweet, but the\n      salt is near it, in her eyes. Her conversation is like Pompaloni's dish,\n      my love -- each one seasons to his taste. Oh, I like Madame Marmet a\n      great deal. Yesterday, after you had gone, I found her alone and sad in a\n      corner of the drawing-room. She was thinking mournfully of her husband. I\n      said to her: 'Do you wish me to think of your husband, too? I will think\n      of him with you. I have been told that he was a learned man, a member of\n      the Royal Society of Paris. Madame Marmet, talk to me of him.' She replied\n      that he had devoted himself to the Etruscans, and that he had given to\n      them his entire life. Oh, darling, I cherished at once the memory of that\n      Monsieur Marmet, who lived for the Etruscans. And then a good idea came to\n      me. I said to Madame Marmet, 'We have at Fiesole, in the Pretorio Palace,\n      a modest little Etruscan museum. Come and visit it with me. Will you?' She\n      replied it was what she most desired to see in Italy. We went to the\n      Pretorio Palace; we saw a lioness and a great many little bronze figures,\n      grotesque, very fat or very thin. The Etruscans were a seriously gay\n      people. They made bronze caricatures. But the monkeys -- some afflicted\n      with big stomachs, others astonished to show their bones -- Madame\n      Marmet looked at them with reluctant admiration. She contemplated them\n      like -- there is a beautiful French word that escapes me -- like the\n      monuments and the trophies of Monsieur Marmet.\"",
                "Madame Martin smiled. But she was restless. She thought the sky dull, the\n      streets ugly, the passers-by common.",
                "\"Oh, darling, the Prince will be very glad to receive you in his palace.\"",
                "\"I do not think so.\"",
                "\"Why, darling, why?\"",
                "\"Because I do not please him much.\"",
                "Vivian Bell declared that the Prince, on the contrary, was a great admirer\n      of the Countess Martin.",
                "The horses stopped before the Albertinelli palace. On the sombre facade\n      were sealed those bronze rings which formerly, on festival nights, held\n      rosin torches. These bronze rings mark, in Florence, the palaces of the\n      most illustrious families. The palace had an air of lofty pride. The\n      Prince hastened to meet them, and led them through the empty salons into\n      the gallery. He, apologized for showing canvases which perhaps had not an\n      attractive aspect. The gallery had been formed by Cardinal Giulio\n      Albertinelli at a time when the taste for Guido and Caraccio, now fallen,\n      had predominated. His ancestor had taken pleasure in gathering the works\n      of the school of Bologna. But he would show to Madame Martin several\n      paintings which had not displeased Miss Bell, among others a Mantegna.",
                "The Countess Martin recognized at once a banal and doubtful collection;\n      she felt bored among the multitude of little Parrocels, showing in the\n      darkness a bit of armor and a white horse.",
                "A valet presented a card.",
                "The Prince read aloud the name of Jacques Dechartre. At that moment he was\n      turning his back on the two visitors. His face wore the expression of\n      cruel displeasure one finds on the marble busts of Roman emperors.\n      Dechartre was on the staircase.",
                "The Prince went toward him with a languid smile. He was no longer Nero,\n      but Antinous.",

                "He led her to a Holy Family exhibited on an easel draped with green\n      velvet, and bearing on the border the name of Michael-Angelo.",
                "\"I have seen that Holy Family in the shops of picture-dealers of London,\n      of Basle, and of Paris. As they could not get the twenty-five louis that\n      it is worth, they have commissioned the last of the Albertinellis to sell\n      it for fifty thousand francs.\"",
                "The Prince, divining what they were saying, approached them gracefully.",

                "And the Prince turned toward Miss Bell, who was trying to find pictures by\n      the pre-Raphaelites.",
                "Dechartre felt uneasy. Since the day before he had thought of Therese. He\n      had all night dreamed and yearned over her image. He saw her again,\n      delightful, but in another manner, and even more desirable than he had\n      imagined in his insomnia; less visionary, of a more vivid piquancy, and\n      also of a mind more mysteriously impenetrable. She was sad; she seemed\n      cold and indifferent. He said to himself that he was nothing to her; that\n      he was becoming importunate and ridiculous. This irritated him. He\n      murmured bitterly in her ear: \"I have reflected. I did not wish to come.\n      Why did I come?\" She understood at once what he meant, that he feared her\n      now, and that he was impatient, timid, and awkward. It pleased her that he\n      was thus, and she was grateful to him for the trouble and the desires he\n      inspired in her. Her heart throbbed faster. But, affecting to understand\n      that he regretted having disturbed himself to come and look at bad\n      paintings, she replied that in truth this gallery was not interesting.\n      Already, under the terror of displeasing her, he felt reassured, and\n      believed that, really indifferent, she had not perceived the accent nor\n      the significance of what he had said. He said \"No, nothing interesting.\"\n       The Prince, who had invited the two visitors to breakfast, asked their\n      friend to remain with them. Dechartre excused himself. He was about to\n      depart when, in the large empty salon, he found himself alone with Madame\n      Martin. He had had the idea of running away from her. He had no other wish\n      now than to see her again. He recalled to her that she was the next\n      morning to visit the Bargello. \"You have permitted me to accompany you.\"\n       She asked him if he had not found her moody and tiresome. Oh, no; he had\n      not thought her tiresome, but he feared she was sad.",
                "\"Alas,\" he added, \"your sadness, your joys, I have not the right to know\n      them.\" She turned toward him a glance almost harsh. \"You do not think that\n      I shall take you for a confidante, do you?\" And she walked away brusquely."

                "After dinner, in the salon of the bells, under the lamps from which the\n      great shades permitted only an obscure light to filter, good Madame Marmet\n      was warming herself by the hearth, with a white cat on her knees. The\n      evening was cool. Madame Martin, her eyes reminiscent of the golden light,\n      the violet peaks, and the ancient trees of Florence, smiled with happy\n      fatigue. She had gone with Miss Bell, Dechartre, and Madame Marmet to the\n      Chartrist convent of Ema. And now, in the intoxication of her visions, she\n      forgot the care of the day before, the importunate letters, the distant\n      reproaches, and thought of nothing in the world but cloisters chiselled\n      and painted, villages with red roofs, and roads where she saw the first\n      blush of spring. Dechartre had modelled for Miss Bell a waxen figure of\n      Beatrice. Vivian was painting angels. Softly bent over her, Prince\n      Albertinelli caressed his beard and threw around him glances that appeared\n      to seek admiration.",
                "Replying to a reflection of Vivian Bell on marriage and love:",
                "\"A woman must choose,\" he said. \"With a man whom women love her heart is\n      not quiet. With a man whom the women do not love she is not happy.\"",
                "\"Darling,\" asked Miss Bell, \"what would you wish for a friend dear to\n      you?\"",
                "\"I should wish, Vivian, that my friend were happy. I should wish also that\n      she were quiet. She should be quiet in hatred of treason, humiliating\n      suspicions, and mistrust.\"",
                "\"But, darling, since the Prince has said that a woman can not have at the\n      same time happiness and security, tell me what your friend should choose.\"",
                "\"One never chooses, Vivian; one never chooses. Do not make me say what I\n      think of marriage.\"",
                "At this moment Choulette appeared, wearing the magnificent air of those\n      beggars of whom small towns are proud. He had played briscola with\n      peasants in a coffeehouse of Fiesole.",
                "\"Here is Monsieur Choulette,\" said Miss Bell. \"He will teach what we are\n      to think of marriage. I am inclined to listen to him as to an oracle. He\n      does not see the things that we see, and he sees things that we do not\n      see. Monsieur Choulette, what do you think of marriage?\"",
                "He took a seat and lifted in the air a Socratic finger:",
                "\"Are you speaking, Mademoiselle, of the solemn union between man and\n      woman? In this sense, marriage is a sacrament. But sometimes, alas! it is\n      almost a sacrilege. As for civil marriage, it is a formality. The\n      importance given to it in our society is an idiotic thing which would have\n      made the women of other times laugh. We owe this prejudice, like many\n      others, to the bourgeois, to the mad performances of a lot of financiers\n      which have been called the Revolution, and which seem admirable to those\n      that have profited by it. Civil marriage is, in reality, only registry,\n      like many others which the State exacts in order to be sure of the\n      condition of persons: in every well organized state everybody must be\n      indexed. Morally, this registry in a big ledger has not even the virtue of\n      inducing a wife to take a lover. Who ever thinks of betraying an oath\n      taken before a mayor? In order to find joy in adultery, one must be\n      pious.\"",
                "\"But, Monsieur,\" said Therese, \"we were married at the church.\"",
                "Then, with an accent of sincerity:",
                "\"I can not understand how a man ever makes up his mind to marry; nor how a\n      woman, after she has reached an age when she knows what she is doing, can\n      commit that folly.\"",
                "The Prince looked at her with distrust. He was clever, but he was\n      incapable of conceiving that one might talk without an object,\n      disinterestedly, and to express general ideas. He imagined that Countess\n      Martin-Belleme was suggesting to him projects that she wished him to\n      consider. And as he was thinking of defending himself and also avenging\n      himself, he made velvet eyes at her and talked with tender gallantry:",
                "\"You display, Madame, the pride of the beautiful and intelligent French\n      women whom subjection irritates. French women love liberty, and none of\n      them is as worthy of liberty as you. I have lived in France a little. I\n      have known and admired the elegant society of Paris, the salons, the\n      festivals, the conversations, the plays. But in our mountains, under our\n      olive-trees, we become rustic again. We assume golden-age manners, and\n      marriage is for us an idyl full of freshness.\"",
                "Vivian Bell examined the statuette which Dechartre had left on the table.",
                "\"Oh! it was thus that Beatrice looked, I am sure. And do you know,\n      Monsieur Dechartre, there are wicked men who say that Beatrice never\n      existed?\"",
                "Choulette declared he wished to be counted among those wicked men. He did\n      not believe that Beatrice had any more reality than other ladies through\n      whom ancient poets who sang of love represented some scholastic idea,\n      ridiculously subtle.",
                "Impatient at praise which was not destined for himself, jealous of Dante\n      as of the universe, a refined man of letters, Choulette continued:",
                "\"I suspect that the little sister of the angels never lived, except in the\n      imagination of the poet. It seems a pure allegory, or, rather, an exercise\n      in arithmetic or a theme of astrology. Dante, who was a good doctor of\n      Bologna and had many moons in his head, under his pointed cap -- Dante\n      believed in the virtue of numbers. That inflamed mathematician dreamed of\n      figures, and his Beatrice is the flower of arithmetic, that is all.\"",
                "And he lighted his pipe.",
                "Vivian Bell exclaimed:",
                "\"Oh, do not talk in that way, Monsieur Choulette. You grieve me much, and\n      if our friend Monsieur Gebhart heard you, he would not be pleased with\n      you. To punish you, Prince Albertinelli will read to you the canticle in\n      which Beatrice explains the spots on the moon. Take the Divine Comedy,\n      Eusebio. It is the white book which you see on the table. Open it and read\n      it.\"",
                "During the Prince's reading, Dechartre, seated on the couch near Countess\n      Martin, talked of Dante with enthusiasm as the best sculptor among the\n      poets. He recalled to Therese the painting they had seen together two days\n      before, on the door of the Servi, a fresco almost obliterated, where one\n      hardly divined the presence of the poet wearing a laurel wreath, Florence,\n      and the seven circles. This was enough to exalt the artist. But she had\n      distinguished nothing, she had not been moved. And then she confessed that\n      Dante did not attract her. Dechartre, accustomed to her sharing all his\n      ideas of art and poetry, felt astonishment and some discontent. He said,\n      aloud:",
                "\"There are many grand and strong things which you do not feel.\"",
                "Miss Bell, lifting her head, asked what were these things that \"darling\"\n       did not feel; and when she learned that it was the genius of Dante, she\n      exclaimed, in mock anger:",
                "\"Oh, do you not honor the father, the master worthy of all praise, the\n      god? I do not love you any more, darling. I detest you.\"",
                "And, as a reproach to Choulette and to the Countess Martin, she recalled\n      the piety of that citizen of Florence who took from the altar the candles\n      that had been lighted in honor of Christ, and placed them before the bust\n      of Dante.",
                "The Prince resumed his interrupted reading. Dechartre persisted in trying\n      to make Therese admire what she did not know. Certainly he would have\n      easily sacrificed Dante and all the poets of the universe for her. But\n      near him, tranquil, and an object of desire, she irritated him, almost\n      without his realizing it, by the charm of her laughing beauty. He\n      persisted in imposing on her his ideas, his artistic passions, even his\n      fantasy, and his capriciousness. He insisted in a low tone, in phrases\n      concise and quarrelsome. She said:",
                "\"Oh, how violent you are!\"",
                "Then he bent to her ear, and in an ardent voice, which he tried to soften:",
                "\"You must take me with my own soul!\"",
                "Therese felt a shiver of fear mingled with joy."

                "She next day she said to herself that she would reply to Robert. It was\n      raining. She listened languidly to the drops falling on the terrace.\n      Vivian Bell, careful and refined, had placed on the table artistic\n      stationery, sheets imitating the vellum of missals, others of pale violet\n      powdered with silver dust; celluloid pens, white and light, which one had\n      to manage like brushes; an iris ink which, on a page, spread a mist of\n      azure and gold. Therese did not like such delicacy. It seemed to her not\n      appropriate for letters which she wished to make simple and modest. When\n      she saw that the name of \"friend,\" given to Robert on the first line,\n      placed on the silvery paper, tinted itself like mother-of-pearl, a half\n      smile came to her lips. The first phrases were hard to write. She hurried\n      the rest, said a great deal of Vivian Bell and of Prince Albertinelli, a\n      little of Choulette, and that she had seen Dechartre at Florence. She\n      praised some pictures of the museums, but without discrimination, and only\n      to fill the pages. She knew that Robert had no appreciation of painting;\n      that he admired nothing except a little cuirassier by Detaille, bought at\n      Goupil's.",
                "She saw again in her mind this cuirassier, which he had shown to her one\n      day, with pride, in his bedroom, near the mirror, under family portraits.\n      All this, at a distance, seemed to her petty and tiresome. She finished\n      her letter with words of friendship, the sweetness of which was not\n      feigned. Truly, she had never felt more peaceful and gentle toward her\n      lover. In four pages she had said little and explained less. She announced\n      only that she should stay a month in Florence, the air of which did her\n      good. Then she wrote to her father, to her husband, and to Princess\n      Seniavine. She went down the stairway with the letters in her hand. In the\n      hall she threw three of them on the silver tray destined to receive papers\n      for the post-office. Mistrusting Madame Marmet, she slipped into her\n      pocket the letter to Le Menil, counting on chance to throw it into a\n      post-box.",
                "Almost at the same time Dechartre came to accompany the three friends in a\n      walk through the city. As he was waiting he saw the letters on the tray.",
                "Without believing that characters could be divined through penmanship, he\n      was susceptible to the form of letters as to elegance of drawing. The\n      writing of Therese charmed him, and he liked its openness, the bold and\n      simple turn of its lines. He looked at the addresses without reading them,\n      with an artist's admiration.",
                "They visited, that morning, Santa Maria Novella, where the Countess Martin\n      had already gone with Madame Marmet. But Miss Bell had reproached them for\n      not observing the beautiful Ginevra of Benci on a fresco of the choir.\n      \"You must visit that figure of the morning in a morning light,\" said\n      Vivian. While the poetess and Therese were talking together, Dechartre\n      listened patiently to Madame Marmet's conversation, filled with anecdotes,\n      wherein academicians dined with elegant women, and shared the anxiety of\n      that lady, much preoccupied for several days by the necessity to buy a\n      tulle veil. She could find none to her taste in the shops of Florence.",
                "As they came out of the church they passed the cobbler's shop. The good\n      man was mending rustic shoes. Madame Martin asked the old man whether he\n      was well, whether he had enough work for a living, whether he was happy.\n      To all these questions he replied with the charming affirmative of Italy,\n      the musical si, which sounded melodious even in his toothless mouth. She\n      made him tell his sparrow's story. The poor bird had once dipped its leg\n      in burning wax.",
                "\"I have made for my little companion a wooden leg out of a match, and he\n      hops upon my shoulder as formerly,\" said the cobbler.",
                "\"It is this good old man,\" said Miss Bell, \"who teaches wisdom to Monsieur\n      Choulette. There was at Athens a cobbler named Simon, who wrote books on\n      philosophy, and who was the friend of Socrates. I have always thought that\n      Monsieur Choulette resembled Socrates.\"",
                "Therese asked the cobbler to tell his name and his history. His name was\n      Serafino Stoppini, and he was a native of Stia. He was old. He had had\n      much trouble in his life.",
                "He lifted his spectacles to his forehead, uncovering blue eyes, very soft,\n      and almost extinguished under their red lids.",

                "Therese, after quitting Dechartre, took breakfast with her friend and\n      Madame Marmet at the house of an old Florentine lady whom Victor Emmanuel\n      had loved when he was Duke of Savoy. For thirty years she had not once\n      gone out of her palace on the Arno, where, she painted, and wearing a wig,\n      she played the guitar in her spacious white salon. She received the best\n      society of Florence, and Miss Bell often called on her. At table this\n      recluse, eighty-seven years of age, questioned the Countess Martin on the\n      fashionable world of Paris, whose movement was familiar to her through the\n      journals. Solitary, she retained respect and a sort of devotion for the\n      world of pleasure.",
                "As they came out of the palazzo, in order to avoid the wind which was\n      blowing on the river, Miss Bell led her friends into the old streets with\n      black stone houses and a view of the distant horizon, where, in the pure\n      air, stands a hill with three slender trees. They walked; and Vivian\n      showed to her friend, on facades where red rags were hanging, some marble\n      masterpiece -- a Virgin, a lily, a St. Catherine. They walked through\n      these alleys of the antique city to the church of Or San Michele, where it\n      had been agreed that Dechartre should meet them. Therese was thinking of\n      him now with deepest interest. Madame Marmet was thinking of buying a\n      veil; she hoped to find one on the Corso. This affair recalled to her M.\n      Lagrange, who, at his regular lecture one day, took from his pocket a veil\n      with gold dots and wiped his forehead with it, thinking it was his\n      handkerchief. The audience was astonished, and whispered to one another.\n      It was a veil that had been confided to him the day before by his niece,\n      Mademoiselle Jeanne Michot, whom he had accompanied to the theatre, and\n      Madame Marmet explained how, finding it in the pocket of his overcoat, he\n      had taken it to return it to his niece.",
                "At Lagrange's name, Therese recalled the flaming comet announced by the\n      savant, and said to herself, with mocking sadness, that it was time for\n      that comet to put an end to the world and take her out of her trouble. But\n      above the walls of the old church she saw the sky, which, cleared of\n      clouds by the wind from the sea, shone pale blue and cold. Miss Bell\n      showed to her one of the bronze statues which, in their chiselled niches,\n      ornament the facade of the church.",
                "\"See, darling, how young and proud is Saint George. Saint George was\n      formerly the cavalier about whom young girls dreamed.\"",
                "But \"darling\" said that he looked precise, tiresome, and stubborn. At this\n      moment she recalled suddenly the letter that was still in her pocket.",
                "\"Ah! here comes Monsieur Dechartre,\" said the good Madame Marmet.",
                "He had looked for them in the church, before the tabernacle. He should\n      have recalled the irresistible attraction which Donatello's St. George\n      held for Miss Bell. He too admired that famous figure. But he retained a\n      particular friendship for St. Mark, rustic and frank, whom they could see\n      in his niche at the left.",
                "When Therese approached the statue which he was pointing out to her, she\n      saw a post-box against the wall of the narrow street opposite the saint.\n      Dechartre, placed at the most convenient point of view, talked of his St.\n      Mark with abundant friendship.",
                "\"It is to him I make my first visit when I come to Florence. I failed to\n      do this only once. He will forgive me; he is an excellent man. He is not\n      appreciated by the crowd, and does not attract attention. I take pleasure\n      in his society, however. He is vivid. I understand that Donatello, after\n      giving a soul to him, exclaimed: 'Mark, why do you not speak?'\"",
                "Madame Marmet, tired of admiring St. Mark, and feeling on her face the\n      burning wind, dragged Miss Bell toward Calzaioli Street in search of a\n      veil.",
                "Therese and Dechartre remained.",
                "\"I like him,\" continued the sculptor; \"I like Saint Mark because I feel in\n      him, much more than in the Saint George, the hand and mind of Donatello,\n      who was a good workman. I like him even more to-day, because he recalls to\n      me, in his venerable and touching candor, the old cobbler to whom you were\n      speaking so kindly this morning.\"",
                "\"Ah,\" she said, \"I have forgotten his name. When we talk with Monsieur\n      Choulette we call him Quentin Matsys, because he resembles the old men of\n      that painter.\"",
                "As they were turning the corner of the church to see the facade, she found\n      herself before the post-box, which was so dusty and rusty that it seemed\n      as if the postman never came near it. She put her letter in it under the\n      ingenuous gaze of St. Mark.",
                "Dechartre saw her, and felt as if a heavy blow had been struck at his\n      heart. He tried to speak, to smile; but the gloved hand which had dropped\n      the letter remained before his eyes. He recalled having seen in the\n      morning Therese's letters on the hall tray. Why had she not put that one\n      with the others? The reason was not hard to guess. He remained immovable,\n      dreamy, and gazed without seeing. He tried to be reassured; perhaps it was\n      an insignificant letter which she was trying to hide from the tiresome\n      curiosity of Madame Marmet.",

                "Perhaps it was a letter to Madame Schmoll, who was not a friend of Madame\n      Marmet, but immediately he realized that this idea was foolish.",
                "All was clear. She had a lover. She was writing to him. Perhaps she was\n      saying to him: \"I saw Dechartre to-day; the poor fellow is deeply in love\n      with me.\" But whether she wrote that or something else, she had a lover.\n      He had not thought of that. To know that she belonged to another made him\n      suffer profoundly. And that hand, that little hand dropping the letter,\n      remained in his eyes and made them burn.",
                "She did not know why he had become suddenly dumb and sombre. When she saw\n      him throw an anxious glance back at the post-box, she guessed the reason.\n      She thought it odd that he should be jealous without having the right to\n      be jealous; but this did not displease her.",

I do not say that you have tried to take advantage of it, as you had\n      the right to do, nor that you are vain about it. I have not remarked\n      vanity in you. It may be possible that you had not noticed. Superior men\n      sometimes lack cleverness. But I know very well that I was not as I should\n      have been, and I beg your pardon.

But soon she had troubled him. The evil had come\n      suddenly and violently one day on the terrace of Fiesole. And now he had\n      not the courage to suffer and say nothing. He had not come with a fixed\n      design. If he spoke of his passion he spoke by force and in spite of\n      himself; in the strong necessity of talking of her to herself, since she\n      was for him the only being in the world. His life was no longer in\n      himself, it was in her. She should know it, then, that he was in love with\n      her, not with vague tenderness, but with cruel ardor. Alas! his\n      imagination was exact and precise. He saw her continually, and she\n      tortured him.",

I have allowed this to be\n      only too plain to you. Count upon my friendship and do not torment\n      yourself.\" She extended her hand to him. He did not take it, but replied,\n      brusquely:",

You have become my\n      evil, my suffering, my torture, and you ask me to be an agreeable friend.\n      Now you are coquettish and cruel. If you can not love me, let me go; I\n      will go, I do not know where, to forget and hate you. For I have against\n      you a latent feeling of hatred and anger. Oh, I love you, I love you!\"",

They were Brothers of Mercy, holding torches, singing psalms on the\n      way to the cemetery. In accordance with the Italian custom, the cortege\n      marched quickly. The crosses, the coffin, the banners, seemed to leap on\n      the deserted quay. Jacques and Therese stood against the wall in order\n      that the funeral train might pass.",

I had the joy of seeing and of dreaming. I enjoyed\n      everything and depended upon nothing. My desires, abundant and light, I\n      gratified without fatigue. I was interested in everything and wished for\n      nothing. One suffers only through the will. Without knowing it, I was\n      happy. Oh, it was not much, it was only enough to live. Now I have no joy\n      in life. My pleasures, the interest that I took in the images of life and\n      of art, the vivid amusement of creating with my hands the figures of my\n      dreams -- you have made me lose everything and have not left me even\n      regret. I do not want my liberty and tranquillity again. It seems to me\n      that before I knew you I did not live; and now that I feel that I am\n      living, I can not live either far from you or near you. I am more wretched\n      than the beggars we saw on the road to Ema. They had air to breathe, and I\n      can breathe only you, whom I have not. Yet I am glad to have known you.\n      That alone counts in my existence. A moment ago I thought I hated you. I\n      was wrong; I adore you, and I bless you for the harm you have done me.

Seeing that he was calm and full of a soft languor,\n      she thought that his love, all imagination, had fled in words, and that\n      his desires had become only a reverie. She had not expected so prompt a\n      resignation. It almost disappointed her to escape the danger she had\n      feared.",
                "She extended her hand to him, more boldly this time than before.",

                "Having gently disengaged herself, she replied, faintly and slowly \"I can\n      not! I can not! You see I am acting frankly with you. I said to you a\n      moment ago that you had not displeased me. But I can not do as you wish.\"",
                "And recalling to her thought the absent one who was waiting for her, she\n      repeated: \"I can not!\" Bending over her he anxiously questioned her eyes,\n      the double stars that trembled and veiled themselves. \"Why? You love me, I\n      feel it, I see it. You love me. Why will you do me this wrong?\"",
                "He drew her to him, wishing to lay his soul, with his lips, on her veiled\n      lips. She escaped him swiftly, saying: \"I can not. Do not ask more. I can\n      not be yours.\"",

He walked\n      through the water and the mud, with a step rapid, blind, like that of one\n      intoxicated. She took fright and shouted. She called him. But he did not\n      turn his head and made no answer. He fled with alarming recklessness. She\n      ran after him.

I am desperate, but I am calm. I was only trying to escape\n      from you. I beg your pardon. But I could not see you any longer. Leave me,\n      I pray you. Farewell!\"",

                "CHAPTER XVII. MISS BELL ASKS A QUESTION",
                "After dinner, Miss Bell was sketching in the drawing-room. She was\n      tracing, on canvas, profiles of bearded Etruscans for a cushion which\n      Madame Marmet was to embroider. Prince Albertinelli was selecting the wool\n      with an almost feminine knowledge of shades. It was late when Choulette,\n      having, as was his habit, played briscola with the cook at the caterer's,\n      appeared, as joyful as if he possessed the mind of a god. He took a seat\n      on a sofa, beside Madame Martin, and looked at her tenderly.\n      Voluptuousness shone in his green eyes. He enveloped her, while talking to\n      her, with poetic and picturesque phrases. It was like the sketch of a\n      lovesong that he was improvising for her. In oddly involved sentences, he\n      told her of the charm that she exhaled.",
                "\"He, too!\" said she to herself.",
                "She amused herself by teasing him. She asked whether he had not found in\n      Florence, in the low quarters, one of the kind of women whom he liked to\n      visit. His preferences were known. He could deny it as much as he wished:\n      no one was ignorant of the door where he had found the cordon of his Third\n      Order. His friends had met him on the boulevard. His taste for unfortunate\n      women was evident in his most beautiful poems.",
                "\"Oh, Monsieur Choulette, so far as I am able to judge, you like very bad\n      women.\"",
                "He replied with solemnity:",
                "\"Madame, you may collect the grain of calumny sown by Monsieur Paul Vence\n      and throw handfuls of it at me. I will not try to avoid it. It is not\n      necessary you should know that I am chaste and that my mind is pure. But\n      do not judge lightly those whom you call unfortunate, and who should be\n      sacred to you, since they are unfortunate. The disdained and lost girl is\n      the docile clay under the finger of the Divine Potter: she is the victim\n      and the altar of the holocaust. The unfortunates are nearer God than the\n      honest women: they have lost conceit. They do not glorify themselves with\n      the untried virtue the matron prides herself on. They possess humility,\n      which is the cornerstone of virtues agreeable to heaven. A short\n      repentance will be sufficient for them to be the first in heaven; for\n      their sins, without malice and without joy, contain their own forgiveness.\n      Their faults, which are pains, participate in the merits attached to pain;\n      slaves to brutal passion, they are deprived of all voluptuousness, and in\n      this they are like the men who practise continence for the kingdom of God.\n      They are like us, culprits; but shame falls on their crime like a balm,\n      suffering purifies it like fire. That is the reason why God will listen to\n      the first voice which they shall send to him. A throne is prepared for\n      them at the right hand of the Father. In the kingdom of God, the queen and\n      the empress will be happy to sit at the feet of the unfortunate; for you\n      must not think that the celestial house is built on a human plan. Far from\n      it, Madame.\"",

                "The guests had been gone for half an hour. Therese, tired, was thinking in\n      her bed, when she heard a knock at the door of her room. The panel opened,\n      and Vivian's little head appeared.",

                "\"Darling, I am sure you have a great deal of reason. Oh, I am sure of it.\n      You are reasonable in the same way that Monsieur Sadler is a violinist. He\n      plays a little out of tune when he wishes. And you, too, when you are not\n      quite logical, it is for your own pleasure. Oh, darling, you have a great\n      deal of reason and of judgment, and I come to ask your advice.\"",
                "Astonished, and a little anxious, Therese denied that she was logical. She\n      denied this very sincerely. But Vivian would not listen to her.",

But, darling, do you know the 'Pantagruel?' 'Pantagruel' is like\n      a beautiful and noble city, full of palaces, in the resplendent dawn,\n      before the street-sweepers of Paris have come. The sweepers have not taken\n      out the dirt, and the maids have not washed the marble steps. And I have\n      seen that French women do not read the 'Pantagruel.' You do not know it?\n      Well, it is not necessary. In the 'Pantagruel,' Panurge asks whether he\n      must marry, and he covers himself with ridicule, my love. Well, I am quite\n      as laughable as he, since I am asking the same question of you.\"",

He was serious and\n      agitated; he spoke little. She was glad he did not display his joy. He led\n      her by the deserted walls of the gardens to a narrow street which she did\n      not know.

In the back was a pavilion with three windows, with\n      columns and a front ornamented with goats and nymphs. On the moss-covered\n      steps he turned in the lock a key that creaked and resisted. He murmured,",

                "They went up a stairway so silent that it seemed to have forgotten the\n      sound of footsteps. He pushed open a door and made Therese enter the room.\n      She went straight to a window opening on the cemetery. Above the wall rose\n      the tops of pine-trees, which are not funereal in this land where mourning\n      is mingled with joy without troubling it, where the sweetness of living\n      extends to the city of the dead. He took her hand and led her to an\n      armchair. He remained standing, and looked at the room which he had\n      prepared so that she would not find herself lost in it. Panels of old\n      print cloth, with figures of Comedy, gave to the walls the sadness of past\n      gayeties. He had placed in a corner a dim pastel which they had seen\n      together at an antiquary's, and which, for its shadowy grace, she called\n      the shade of Rosalba. There was a grandmother's armchair; white chairs;\n      and on the table painted cups and Venetian glasses. In all the corners\n      were screens of colored paper, whereon were masks, grotesque figures, the\n      light soul of Florence, of Bologna, and of Venice in the time of the Grand\n      Dukes and of the last Doges. A mirror and a carpet completed the\n      furnishings.",
                "He closed the window and lighted the fire. She sat in the armchair, and as\n      she remained in it erect, he knelt before her, took her hands, kissed\n      them, and looked at her with a wondering expression, timorous and proud.\n      Then he pressed his lips to the tip of her boot.",

                "Two hours later, when the setting sun made immeasurably longer the shadows\n      on the stones, Therese, who had wished to walk alone in the city, found\n      herself in front of the two obelisks of Santa Maria Novella without\n      knowing how she had reached there.

                "CHAPTER XIX. CHOULETTE TAKES A JOURNEY",
                "It was the next day.",
                "Having carefully placed on the drawing-room table his knotty stick, his\n      pipe, and his antique carpet-bag, Choulette bowed to Madame Martin, who\n      was reading at the window. He was going to Assisi. He wore a sheepskin\n      coat, and resembled the old shepherds in pictures of the Nativity.",
                "\"Farewell, Madame. I am quitting Fiesole, you, Dechartre, the too handsome\n      Prince Albertinelli, and that gentle ogress, Miss Bell. I am going to\n      visit the Assisi mountain, which the poet says must be named no longer\n      Assisi, but the Orient, because it is there that the sun of love rose. I\n      am going to kneel before the happy crypt where Saint Francis is resting in\n      a stone manger, with a stone for a pillow. For he would not even take out\n      of this world a shroud -- out of this world where he left the\n      revelation of all joy and of all kindness.\"",
                "\"Farewell, Monsieur Choulette. Bring me a medal of Saint Clara. I like\n      Saint Clara a great deal.\"",
                "\"You are right, Madame; she was a woman of strength and prudence. When\n      Saint Francis, ill and almost blind, came to spend a few days at Saint\n      Damien, near his friend, she built with her own hands a hut for him in the\n      garden. Pain, languor, and burning eyelids deprived him of sleep. Enormous\n      rats came to attack him at night. Then he composed a joyous canticle in\n      praise of our splendid brother the Sun, and our sister the Water, chaste,\n      useful, and pure. My most beautiful verses have less charm and splendor.\n      And it is just that it should be thus, for Saint Francis's soul was more\n      beautiful than his mind. I am better than all my contemporaries whom I\n      have known, yet I am worth nothing. When Saint Francis had composed his\n      Song of the Sun he rejoiced. He thought: 'We shall go, my brothers and I,\n      into the cities, and stand in the public squares, with a lute, on the\n      market-day. Good people will come near us, and we shall say to them: \"We\n      are the jugglers of God, and we shall sing a lay to you. If you are\n      pleased, you will reward us.\" They will promise, and when we shall have\n      sung, we shall recall their promise to them. We shall say to them: \"You\n      owe a reward to us. And the one that we ask of you is that you love one\n      another.\" Doubtless, to keep their word and not injure God's poor\n      jugglers, they will avoid doing ill to others.'\"",
                "Madame Martin thought St. Francis was the most amiable of the saints.",
                "\"His work,\" replied Choulette, \"was destroyed while he lived. Yet he died\n      happy, because in him was joy with humility. He was, in fact, God's sweet\n      singer. And it is right that another poor poet should take his task and\n      teach the world true religion and true joy. I shall be that poet, Madame,\n      if I can despoil myself of reason and of conceit. For all moral beauty is\n      achieved in this world through the inconceivable wisdom that comes from\n      God and resembles folly.\"",
                "\"I shall not discourage you, Monsieur Choulette. But I am anxious about\n      the fate which you reserve for the poor women in your new society. You\n      will imprison them all in convents.\"",
                "\"I confess,\" replied Choulette, \"that they embarrass me a great deal in my\n      project of reform. The violence with which one loves them is harsh and\n      injurious. The pleasure they give is not peaceful, and does not lead to\n      joy. I have committed for them, in my life, two or three abominable crimes\n      of which no one knows. I doubt whether I shall ever invite you to supper,\n      Madame, in the new Saint Mary of the Angels.\" He took his pipe, his\n      carpet-bag, and his stick:",
                "\"The crimes of love shall be forgiven. Or, rather, one can not do evil\n      when one loves purely. But sensual love is formed of hatred, selfishness,\n      and anger as much as of passion. Because I found you beautiful one night,\n      on this sofa, I was assailed by a cloud of violent thoughts. I had come\n      from the Albergo, where I had heard Miss Bell's cook improvise\n      magnificently twelve hundred verses on Spring. I was inundated by a\n      celestial joy which the sight of you made me lose. It must be that a\n      profound truth is enclosed in the curse of Eve. For, near you, I felt\n      reckless and wicked. I had soft words on my lips. They were lies. I felt\n      that I was your adversary and your enemy; I hated you. When I saw you\n      smile, I felt a desire to kill you.\"",
                "\"Truly?\"",
                "\"Oh, Madame, it is a very natural sentiment, which you must have inspired\n      more than once. But common people feel it without being conscious of it,\n      while my vivid imagination represents me to myself incessantly. I\n      contemplate my mind, at times splendid, often hideous. If you had been\n      able to read my mind that night you would have screamed with fright.\"",
                "Therese smiled:",
                "\"Farewell, Monsieur Choulette. Do not forget my medal of Saint Clara.\"",
                "He placed his bag on the floor, raised his arm, and pointed his finger:",
                "\"You have nothing to fear from me. But the one whom you will love and who\n      will love you will harm you. Farewell, Madame.\"",
                "He took his luggage and went out. She saw his long, rustic form disappear\n      behind the bushes of the garden.",
                "In the afternoon she went to San Marco, where Dechartre was waiting for\n      her. She desired yet she feared to see him again so soon. She felt an\n      anguish which an unknown sentiment, profoundly soft, appeased. She did not\n      feel the stupor of the first time that she had yielded for love; she did\n      not feel the brusque vision of the irreparable. She was under influences\n      slower, more vague, and more powerful. This time a charming reverie bathed\n      the reminiscence of the caresses which she had received. She was full of\n      trouble and anxiety, but she felt no regret. She had acted less through\n      her will than through a force which she divined to be higher. She absolved\n      herself because of her disinterestedness. She counted on nothing, having\n      calculated nothing.",
                "Doubtless, she had been wrong to yield, since she was not free; but she\n      had exacted nothing. Perhaps she was for him only a violent caprice. She\n      did not know him. She had not one of those vivid imaginations that surpass\n      immensely, in good as in evil, common mediocrity. If he went away from her\n      and disappeared she would not reproach him for it; at least, she thought\n      not. She would keep the reminiscence and the imprint of the rarest and\n      most precious thing one may find in the world. Perhaps he was incapable of\n      real attachment. He thought he loved her. He had loved her for an hour.\n      She dared not wish for more, in the embarrassment of the false situation\n      which irritated her frankness and her pride, and which troubled the\n      lucidity of her intelligence. While the carriage was carrying her to San\n      Marco, she persuaded herself that he would say nothing to her of the day\n      before, and that the room from which one could see the pines rise to the\n      sky would leave to them only the dream of a dream.",
                "He extended his hand to her. Before he had spoken she saw in his look that\n      he loved her as much now as before, and she perceived at the same time\n      that she wished him to be thus.",
                "\"You -- \" he said, \"I have been here since noon. I was waiting, knowing\n      that you would not come so soon, but able to live only at the place where\n      I was to see you. It is you! Talk; let me see and hear you.\"",
                "\"Then you still love me?\"",
                "\"It is now that I love you. I thought I loved you when you were only a\n      phantom. Now, you are the being in whose hands I have put my soul. It is\n      true that you are mine! What have I done to obtain the greatest, the only,\n      good of this world? And those men with whom the earth is covered think\n      they are living! I alone live! Tell me, what have I done to obtain you?\"",
                "\"Oh, what had to be done, I did. I say this to you frankly. If we have\n      reached that point, the fault is mine. You see, women do not always\n      confess it, but it is always their fault. So, whatever may happen, I never\n      will reproach you for anything.\"",
                "An agile troupe of yelling beggars, guides, and coachmen surrounded them\n      with an importunity wherein was mingled the gracefulness which Italians\n      never lose. Their subtlety made them divine that these were lovers, and\n      they knew that lovers are prodigal. Dechartre threw coin to them, and they\n      all returned to their happy laziness.",
                "A municipal guard received the visitors. Madame Martin regretted that\n      there was no monk. The white gown of the Dominicans was so beautiful under\n      the arcades of the cloister!",
                "They visited the cells where, on the bare plaster, Fra Angelico, aided by\n      his brother Benedetto, painted innocent pictures for his companions.",
                "\"Do you recall the winter night when, meeting you before the Guimet\n      Museum, I accompanied you to the narrow street bordered by small gardens\n      which leads to the Billy Quay? Before separating we stopped a moment on\n      the parapet along which runs a thin boxwood hedge. You looked at that\n      boxwood, dried by winter. And when you went away I looked at it for a long\n      time.\"",
                "They were in the cell wherein Savonarola lived. The guide showed to them\n      the portrait and the relics of the martyr.",
                "\"What could there have been in me that you liked that day? It was dark.\"",
                "\"I saw you walk. It is in movements that forms speak. Each one of your\n      steps told me the secrets of your charming beauty. Oh! my imagination was\n      never discreet in anything that concerned you. I did not dare to speak to\n      you. When I saw you, it frightened me. It frightened me because you could\n      do everything for me. When you were present, I adored you tremblingly.\n      When you were far from me, I felt all the impieties of desire.\"",
                "\"I did not suspect this. But do you recall the first time we saw each\n      other, when Paul Vence introduced you? You were seated near a screen. You\n      were looking at the miniatures. You said to me: 'This lady, painted by\n      Siccardi, resembles Andre Chenier's mother.' I replied to you: 'She is my\n      husband's great-grandmother. How did Andre Chenier's mother look?' And you\n      said: 'There is a portrait of her: a faded Levantine.'\"",
                "He excused himself and thought that he had not spoken so impertinently.",

And there,\n      before the Virgin who, in the pale sky, receives from God the Father the\n      immortal crown, he took Therese in his arms and placed a kiss on her lips,\n      almost in view of two Englishwomen who were walking through the corridors,\n      consulting their Baedeker. She said to him:",

                "\"Therese, I am suffering in my happiness from everything that is yours and\n      that escapes me. I am suffering because you do not live for me alone. I\n      wish to have you wholly, and to have had you in the past.\"",
                "She shrugged her shoulders a little.",

                "\"Well, I may say this to you: I never have felt that I lived except with\n      you.\"",
                "When she returned to Fiesole, she found a brief and threatening letter\n      from Le Menil. He could not understand, her prolonged absence, her\n      silence. If she did not announce at once her return, he would go to\n      Florence for her.",
                "She read without astonishment, but was annoyed to see that everything\n      disagreeable that could happen was happening, and that nothing would be\n      spared to her of what she had feared. She could still calm him and\n      reassure him: she had only to say to him that she loved him; that she\n      would soon return to Paris; that he should renounce the foolish idea of\n      rejoining her here; that Florence was a village where they would be\n      watched at once. But she would have to write: \"I love you.\" She must quiet\n      him with caressing phrases.",
                "She had not the courage to do it. She would let him guess the truth. She\n      accused herself in veiled terms. She wrote obscurely of souls carried away\n      by the flood of life, and of the atom one is on the moving ocean of\n      events. She asked him, with affectionate sadness, to keep of her a fond\n      reminiscence in a corner of his soul.",
                "She took the letter to the post-office box on the Fiesole square. Children\n      were playing in the twilight. She looked from the top of the hill to the\n      beautiful cup which carried beautiful Florence like a jewel. And the peace\n      of night made her shiver. She dropped the letter into the box. Then only\n      she had the clear vision of what she had done and of what the result would\n      be."

Her fatigue, her sadness, her disgust with the\n      day, the reminiscence of violence, her regained liberty, the need of\n      forgetting, remains of fright, everything vivified, awakened her\n      tenderness. She threw her arms around the neck of her lover.",

But I do\n      wrong to extend to you an invitation which you can not accept. It will not\n      be permitted to you to sleep your eternal sleep at the foot of the hill of\n      Fiesole, my love. You must rest in Paris, in a handsome tomb, by the side\n      of Count Martin-Belleme.\"",

They died almost at the same time, and were placed\n      in two tombs separated by a road. But every night a sweetbrier bush threw\n      from one tomb to the other its flowery branches. The two coffins had to be\n      buried together.\"",
                "When they had passed the Badia, they saw a procession coming up the side\n      of the hill. The wind blew on the candles borne in gilded wooden\n      candlesticks. The girls of the societies, dressed in white and blue,\n      carried painted banners. Then came a little St. John, blond, curly-haired,\n      nude, under a lamb's fleece which showed his arms and shoulders; and a St.\n      Mary Magdalene, seven years old, crowned only with her waving golden hair.\n      The people of Fiesole followed. Countess Martin recognized Choulette among\n      them. With a candle in one hand, a book in the other, and blue spectacles\n      on the end of his nose, he was singing. His unkempt beard moved up and\n      down with the rhythm of the song. In the harshness of light and shade that\n      worked in his face, he had an air that suggested a solitary monk capable\n      of accomplishing a century of penance.",
                "\"How amusing he is!\" said Therese. \"He is making a spectacle of himself\n      for himself. He is a great artist.\"",
                "\"Darling, why will you insist that Monsieur Choulette is not a pious man?\n      Why? There is much joy and much beauty in faith. Poets know this. If\n      Monsieur Choulette had not faith, he could not write the admirable verses\n      that he does.\"",
                "\"And you, dear, have you faith?\"",
                "\"Oh, yes; I believe in God and in the word of Christ.\"",
                "Now the banners and the white veils had disappeared down the road. But one\n      could see on the bald cranium of Choulette the flame of the candle\n      reflected in rays of gold.",
                "Dechartre, however, was waiting alone in the garden. Therese found him\n      resting on the balcony of the terrace where he had felt the first\n      sufferings of love. While Miss Bell and the Prince were trying to fix upon\n      a suitable place for the campanile, Dechartre led his beloved under the\n      trees.",

                "They were already at table when Choulette appeared, with the face of an\n      antique satyr. A terrible joy shone in his phosphorous eyes. Since his\n      return from Assisi, he lived only among paupers, drank chianti all day\n      with girls and artisans to whom he taught the beauty of joy and innocence,\n      the advent of Jesus Christ, and the imminent abolition of taxes and\n      military service. At the beginning of the procession he had gathered\n      vagabonds in the ruins of the Roman theatre, and had delivered to them in\n      a macaronic language, half French and half Tuscan, a sermon, which he took\n      pleasure in repeating:",

But one has not the right\n      to kill; that is the reason why the just man will not draw from the urn a\n      number that will send him to the war. The right is not to pamper the folly\n      and crimes of a prince raised over a kingdom or over a republic; and that\n      is the reason why the just man will not pay taxes and will not give money\n      to the publicans. He will enjoy in peace the fruit of his work, and he\n      will make bread with the wheat that he has sown, and he will eat the\n      fruits of the trees that he has cut.\"",
                "\"Ah, Monsieur Choulette,\" said Prince Albertinelli, gravely, \"you are\n      right to take interest in the state of our unfortunate fields, which taxes\n      exhaust.

His affected gentleness concealed\n      his stubbornness. He had only useful vices. It was to become a great\n      Tuscan landowner that he had dealt in pictures, sold the famous ceilings\n      of his palace, made love to rich old women, and, finally, sought the hand\n      of Miss Bell, whom he knew to be skilful at earning money and practised in\n      the art of housekeeping. He really liked peasants. The ardent praises of\n      Choulette, which he understood vaguely, awakened this affection in him. He\n      forgot himself enough to express his mind:",

                "He had the idea that it would be disagreeable to her to hear him speak of\n      that meeting. He looked around the table, and saw the expression of\n      anxious surprise which Dechartre could not restrain. He insisted:",

                "\"Oh,\" said Therese, negligently, \"I have not seen him for a long time. I\n      was much surprised to meet him at Florence at the moment of his\n      departure.\"",

I have observed that hunters like animals. I\n      assure you, darling, that Monsieur Le Menil talks admirably about hares.\n      He knows their habits. He said to me it was a pleasure to look at them\n      dancing in the moonlight on the plains. He assured me that they were very\n      intelligent, and that he had seen an old hare, pursued by dogs, force\n      another hare to get out of the trail so as to deceive the hunters.\n      Darling, did Monsieur Le Menil ever talk to you about hares?\"",
                "Therese replied she did not know, and that she thought hunters were\n      tiresome.",
                "Miss Bell exclaimed. She did not think M. Le Menil was ever tiresome when\n      talking of the hares that danced in the moonlight on the plains and among\n      the vines. She would like to raise a hare, like Phanion.",
                "\"Darling, you do not know Phanion. Oh, I am sure that Monsieur Dechartre\n      knows her. She was beautiful, and dear to poets. She lived in the Island\n      of Cos, beside a dell which, covered with lemon-trees, descended to the\n      blue sea. And they say that she looked at the blue waves. I related\n      Phanion's history to Monsieur Le Menil, and he was very glad to hear it.\n      She had received from some hunter a little hare with long ears. She held\n      it on her knees and fed it on spring flowers. It loved Phanion and forgot\n      its mother. It died before having eaten too many flowers. Phanion lamented\n      over its loss. She buried it in the lemon-grove, in a grave which she\n      could see from her bed. And the shade of the little hare was consoled by\n      the songs of the poets.\"",
                "The good Madame Marmet said that M. Le Menil pleased by his elegant and\n      discreet manners, which young men no longer practise. She would have liked\n      to see him. She wanted him to do something for her.",
                "\"Or, rather, for my nephew,\" she said. \"He is a captain in the artillery,\n      and his chiefs like him.

If Monsieur Le Menil would\n      ask his uncle to write to Colonel Faure in favor of my nephew I should be\n      grateful to him. My nephew is not a stranger to Monsieur Le Menil.

                "While the rolling of arriving boxes filled the Bell villa; while Pauline,\n      loaded with parcels, lightly came down the steps; while good Madame\n      Marmet, with tranquil vigilance, supervised everything; and while Miss\n      Bell finished dressing in her room, Therese, dressed in gray, resting on\n      the terrace, looked once again at the Flower City.",
                "She had decided to return home. Her husband recalled her in every one of\n      his letters. If, as he asked her to do, she returned to Paris in the first\n      days of May, they might give two or three dinners, followed by receptions.\n      His political group was supported by public opinion. The tide was pushing\n      him along, and Garain thought the Countess Martin's drawing-room might\n      exercise an excellent influence on the future of the country. These\n      reasons moved her not; but she felt a desire to be agreeable to her\n      husband. She had received the day before a letter from her father,\n      Monsieur Montessuy, who, without sharing the political views of his\n      son-in-law and without giving any advice to his daughter, insinuated that\n      society was beginning to gossip of the Countess Martin's mysterious\n      sojourn at Florence among poets and artists. The Bell villa took, from a\n      distance, an air of sentimental fantasy. She felt herself that she was too\n      closely observed at Resole. Madame Marmet annoyed her. Prince Albertinelli\n      disquieted her. The meetings in the pavilion of the Via Alfieri had become\n      difficult and dangerous. Professor Arrighi, whom the Prince often met, had\n      seen her one night as she was walking through the deserted streets leaning\n      on Dechartre. Professor Arrighi, author of a treatise on agriculture, was\n      the most amiable of wise men. He had turned his beautiful, heroic face,\n      and said, only the next day, to the young woman \"Formerly, I could discern\n      from a long distance the coming of a beautiful woman. Now that I have gone\n      beyond the age to be viewed favorably by women, heaven has pity on me.\n      Heaven prevents my seeing them. My eyes are very bad. The most charming\n      face I can no longer recognize.\" She had understood, and heeded the\n      warning. She wished now to conceal her joy in the vastness of Paris.",
                "Vivian, to whom she had announced her departure, had asked her to remain a\n      few days longer. But Therese suspected that her friend was still shocked\n      by the advice she had received one night in the lemon-decorated room;\n      that, at least, she did not enjoy herself entirely in the familiarity of a\n      confidante who disapproved of her choice, and whom the Prince had\n      represented to her as a coquette, and perhaps worse. The date of her\n      departure had been fixed for May 5th.",
                "The day shone brilliant, pure, and charming on the Arno valley. Therese,\n      dreamy, saw from the terrace the immense morning rose placed in the blue\n      cup of Florence. She leaned forward to discover, at the foot of the\n      flowery hills, the imperceptible point where she had known infinite joys.\n      There the cemetery garden made a small, sombre spot near which she divined\n      the Via Alfieri. She saw herself again in the room wherein, doubtless, she\n      never would enter again. The hours there passed had for her the sadness of\n      a dream. She felt her eyes becoming veiled, her knees weaken, and her soul\n      shudder. It seemed to her that life was no longer in her, and that she had\n      left it in that corner where she saw the black pines raise their immovable\n      summits. She reproached herself for feeling anxiety without reason, when,\n      on the contrary, she should be reassured and joyful. She knew she would\n      meet Jacques Dechartre in Paris. They would have liked to arrive there at\n      the same time, or, rather, to go there together. They had thought it\n      indispensable that he should remain three or four days longer in Florence,\n      but their meeting would not be retarded beyond that. They had appointed a\n      rendezvous, and she rejoiced in the thought of it. She wore her love\n      mingled with her being and running in her blood. Still, a part of herself\n      remained in the pavilion decorated with goats and nymphs a part of herself\n      which never would return to her. In the full ardor of life, she was dying\n      for things infinitely delicate and precious. She recalled that Dechartre\n      had said to her: \"Love likes charms. I gathered from the terrace the\n      leaves of a tree that you had admired.\" Why had she not thought of taking\n      a stone of the pavilion wherein she had forgotten the world?",
                "A shout from Pauline drew her from her thoughts. Choulette, jumping from a\n      bush, had suddenly kissed the maid, who was carrying overcoats and bags\n      into the carriage. Now he was running through the alleys, joyful, his ears\n      standing out like horns. He bowed to the Countess Martin.",
                "\"I have, then, to say farewell to you, Madame.\"",
                "He intended to remain in Italy. A lady was calling him, he said: it was\n      Rome. He wanted to see the cardinals. One of them, whom people praised as\n      an old man full of sense, would perhaps share the ideas of the socialist\n      and revolutionary church. Choulette had his aim: to plant on the ruins of\n      an unjust and cruel civilization the Cross of Calvary, not dead and bare,\n      but vivid, and with its flowery arms embracing the world. He was founding\n      with that design an order and a newspaper. Madame Martin knew the order.\n      The newspaper was to be sold for one cent, and to be written in rhythmic\n      phrases. It was a newspaper to be sung. Verse, simple, violent, or joyful,\n      was the only language that suited the people. Prose pleased only people\n      whose intelligence was very subtle. He had seen anarchists in the taverns\n      of the Rue Saint Jacques. They spent their evenings reciting and listening\n      to romances.",
                "And he added:",
                "\"A newspaper which shall be at the same time a song-book will touch the\n      soul of the people. People say I have genius. I do not know whether they\n      are right. But it must be admitted that I have a practical mind.\"",
                "Miss Bell came down the steps, putting on her gloves:",
                "\"Oh, darling, the city and the mountains and the sky wish you to lament\n      your departure. They make themselves beautiful to-day in order to make you\n      regret quitting them and desire to see them again.\"",
                "But Choulette, whom the dryness of the Tuscan climate tired, regretted\n      green Umbria and its humid sky. He recalled Assisi. He said:",
                "\"There are woods and rocks, a fair sky and white clouds. I have walked\n      there in the footsteps of good Saint Francis, and I transcribed his\n      canticle to the sun in old French rhymes, simple and poor.\"",
                "Madame Martin said she would like to hear it. Miss Bell was already\n      listening, and her face wore the fervent expression of an angel sculptured\n      by Mino.",
                "Choulette told them it was a rustic and artless work. The verses were not\n      trying to be beautiful. They were simple, although uneven, for the sake of\n      lightness. Then, in a slow and monotonous voice, he recited the canticle.",
                "\"Oh, Monsieur Choulette,\" said Miss Bell, \"this canticle goes up to\n      heaven, like the hermit in the Campo Santo of Pisa, whom some one saw\n      going up the mountain that the goats liked. I will tell you. The old\n      hermit went up, leaning on the staff of faith, and his step was unequal\n      because the crutch, being on one side, gave one of his feet an advantage\n      over the other. That is the reason why your verses are unequal. I have\n      understood it.\"",
                "The poet accepted this praise, persuaded that he had unwittingly deserved\n      it.",
                "\"You have faith, Monsieur Choulette,\" said Therese. \"Of what use is it to\n      you if not to write beautiful verses?\"",
                "\"Faith serves me to commit sin, Madame.\"",
                "\"Oh, we commit sins without that.\"",
                "Madame Marmet appeared, equipped for the journey, in the tranquil joy of\n      returning to her pretty apartment, her little dog Toby, her old friend\n      Lagrange, and to see again, after the Etruscans of Fiesole, the skeleton\n      warrior who, among the bonbon boxes, looked out of the window.",

                "Dechartre came to the carriage to salute the two travellers. Separated\n      from him, Therese felt what he was to her: he had given to her a new taste\n      of life, delicious and so vivid, so real, that she felt it on her lips.\n      She lived under a charm in the dream of seeing him again, and was\n      surprised when Madame Marmet, along the journey, said: \"I think we are\n      passing the frontier,\" or \"Rose-bushes are in bloom by the seaside.\" She\n      was joyful when, after a night at the hotel in Marseilles, she saw the\n      gray olive-trees in the stony fields, then the mulberry-trees and the\n      distant profile of Mount Pilate, and the Rhone, and Lyons, and then the\n      familiar landscapes, the trees raising their summits into bouquets clothed\n      in tender green, and the lines of poplars beside the rivers. She enjoyed\n      the plenitude of the hours she lived and the astonishment of profound\n      joys. And it was with the smile of a sleeper suddenly awakened that, at\n      the station in Paris, in the light of the station, she greeted her\n      husband, who was glad to see her. When she kissed Madame Marmet, she told\n      her that she thanked her with all her heart. And truly she was grateful to\n      all things, like M. Choulette's St. Francis.",
                "In the coupe, which followed the quays in the luminous dust of the setting\n      sun, she listened without impatience to her husband confiding to her his\n      successes as an orator, the intentions of his parliamentary groups, his\n      projects, his hopes, and the necessity to give two or three political\n      dinners. She closed her eyes in order to think better. She said to\n      herself: \"I shall have a letter to-morrow, and shall see him again within\n      eight days.\" When the coupe passed on the bridge, she looked at the water,\n      which seemed to roll flames; at the smoky arches; at the rows of trees; at\n      the heads of the chestnut-trees in bloom on the Cours-la-Reine; all these\n      familiar aspects seemed to be clothed for her in novel magnificence. It\n      seemed to her that her love had given a new color to the universe. And she\n      asked herself whether the trees and the stones recognized her. She was\n      thinking; \"How is it that my silence, my eyes, and heaven and earth do not\n      tell my dear secret?\"",
                "M. Martin-Belleme, thinking she was a little tired, advised her to rest.\n      And at night, closeted in her room, in the silence wherein she heard the\n      palpitations of her heart, she wrote to the absent one a letter full of\n      these words, which are similar to flowers in their perpetual novelty: \"I\n      love you. I am waiting for you. I am happy. I feel you are near me. There\n      is nobody except you and me in the world. I see from my window a blue star\n      which trembles, and I look at it, thinking that you see it in Florence. I\n      have put on my table the little red lily spoon. Come! Come!\" And she found\n      thus, fresh in her mind, the eternal sensations and images.",
                "For a week she lived an inward life, feeling within her the soft warmth\n      which remained of the days passed in the Via Alfieri, breathing the kisses\n      which she had received, and loving herself for being loved. She took\n      delicate care and displayed attentive taste in new gowns. It was to\n      herself, too, that she was pleasing. Madly anxious when there was nothing\n      for her at the postoffice, trembling and joyful when she received through\n      the small window a letter wherein she recognized the large handwriting of\n      her beloved, she devoured her reminiscences, her desires, and her hopes.\n      Thus the hours passed quickly.",
                "The morning of the day when he was to arrive seemed to her to be odiously\n      long. She was at the station before the train arrived. A delay had been\n      signalled. It weighed heavily upon her. Optimist in her projects, and\n      placing by force, like her father, faith on the side of her will, that\n      delay which she had not foreseen seemed to her to be treason. The gray\n      light, which the three-quarters of an hour filtered through the\n      window-panes of the station, fell on her like the rays of an immense\n      hour-glass which measured for her the minutes of happiness lost. She was\n      lamenting her fate, when, in the red light of the sun, she saw the\n      locomotive of the express stop, monstrous and docile, on the quay, and, in\n      the crowd of travellers coming out of the carriages, Jacques approached\n      her. He was looking at her with that sort of sombre and violent joy which\n      she had often observed in him. He said:",
                "\"At last, here you are. I feared to die before seeing you again. You do\n      not know, I did not know myself, what torture it is to live a week away\n      from you. I have returned to the little pavilion of the Via Alfieri. In\n      the room you know, in front of the old pastel, I have wept for love and\n      rage.\"",

                "\"And I, do you not think that I called you, that I wanted you, that when\n      alone I extended my arms toward you? I had hidden your letters in the\n      chiffonier where my jewels are. I read them at night: it was delicious,\n      but it was imprudent. Your letters were yourself -- too much and not\n      enough.\"",
                "They traversed the court where fiacres rolled away loaded with boxes. She\n      asked whether they were to take a carriage.",

                "He was not listening to her nor looking at her. He walked quickly with her\n      along the paved street, and through a narrow stairway reached a deserted\n      street near the station. There, between wood and coal yards, was a hotel\n      with a restaurant on the first floor and tables on the sidewalk. Under the\n      painted sign were white curtains at the windows.

                "CHAPTER XXVI. IN DECHARTRE'S STUDIO",
                "A fiacre brought her, the next day, to a populous street, half sad, half\n      gay, with walls of gardens in the intervals of new houses, and stopped at\n      the point where the sidewalk passes under the arcade of a mansion of the\n      Regency, covered now with dust and oblivion, and fantastically placed\n      across the street. Here and there green branches lent gayety to that city\n      corner. Therese, while ringing at the door, saw in the limited perspective\n      of the houses a pulley at a window and a gilt key, the sign of a\n      locksmith. Her eyes were full of this picture, which was new to her.\n      Pigeons flew above her head; she heard chickens cackle. A servant with a\n      military look opened the door. She found herself in a yard covered with\n      sand, shaded by a tree, where, at the left, was the janitor's box with\n      bird-cages at the windows. On that side rose, under a green trellis, the\n      mansard of the neighboring house. A sculptor's studio backed on it its\n      glass-covered roof, which showed plaster figures asleep in the dust. At\n      the right, the wall that closed the yard bore debris of monuments, broken\n      bases of columnettes. In the rear, the house, not very large, showed the\n      six windows of its facade, half hidden by vines and rosebushes.",
                "Philippe Dechartre, infatuated with the architecture of the fifteenth\n      century in France, had reproduced there very cleverly the characteristics\n      of a private house of the time of Louis XII. That house, begun in the\n      middle of the Second Empire, had not been finished. The builder of so many\n      castles died without being able to finish his own house. It was better\n      thus. Conceived in a manner which had then its distinction and its value,\n      but which seems to-day banal and outlandish, having lost little by little\n      its large frame of gardens, cramped now between the walls of the tall\n      buildings, Philippe Dechartre's little house, by the roughness of its\n      stones, by the naive heaviness of its windows, by the simplicity of the\n      roof, which the architect's widow had caused to be covered with little\n      expense, by all the lucky accidents of the unfinished and unpremeditated,\n      corrected the lack of grace of its new and affected antiquity and\n      archeologic romanticism, and harmonized with the humbleness of a district\n      made ugly by progress of population.",
                "In fine, notwithstanding its appearance of ruin and its green drapery,\n      that little house had its charm. Suddenly and instinctively, Therese\n      discovered in it other harmonies. In the elegant negligence which extended\n      from the walls covered with vines to the darkened panes of the studio, and\n      even in the bent tree, the bark of which studded with its shells the wild\n      grass of the courtyard, she divined the mind of the master, nonchalant,\n      not skilful in preserving, living in the long solitude of passionate men.\n      She had in her joy a sort of grief at observing this careless state in\n      which her lover left things around him. She found in it a sort of grace\n      and nobility, but also a spirit of indifference contrary to her own\n      nature, opposite to the interested and careful mind of the Montessuys. At\n      once she thought that, without spoiling the pensive softness of that rough\n      corner, she would bring to it her well-ordered activity; she would have\n      sand thrown in the alley, and in the angle wherein a little sunlight came\n      she would put the gayety of flowers. She looked sympathetically at a\n      statue which had come there from some park, a Flora, lying on the earth,\n      eaten by black moss, her two arms lying by her sides. She thought of\n      raising her soon, of making of her a centrepiece for a fountain.\n      Dechartre, who for an hour had been watching for her coming, joyful,\n      anxious, trembling in his agitated happiness, descended the steps. In the\n      fresh shade of the vestibule, wherein she divined confusedly the severe\n      splendor of bronze and marble statues, she stopped, troubled by the\n      beatings of her heart, which throbbed with all its might in her chest. He\n      pressed her in his arms and kissed her. She heard him, through the tumult\n      of her temples, recalling to her the short delights of the day before. She\n      saw again the lion of the Atlas on the carpet, and returned to Jacques his\n      kisses with delicious slowness. He led her, by a wooden stairway, into the\n      vast hall which had served formerly as a workshop, where he designed and\n      modelled his figures, and, above all, read; he liked reading as if it were\n      opium.",
                "Pale-tinted Gothic tapestries, which let one perceive in a marvellous\n      forest a lady at the feet of whom a unicorn lay on the grass, extended\n      above cabinets to the painted beams of the ceiling. He led her to a large\n      and low divan, loaded with cushions covered with sumptuous fragments of\n      Spanish and Byzantine cloaks; but she sat in an armchair. \"You are here!\n      You are here! The world may come to an end.\"",
                "She replied \"Formerly I thought of the end of the world, but I was not\n      afraid of it. Monsieur Lagrange had promised it to me, and I was waiting\n      for it. When I did not know you, I felt so lonely.\" She looked at the\n      tables loaded with vases and statuettes, the tapestries, the confused and\n      splendid mass of weapons, the animals, the marbles, the paintings, the\n      ancient books. \"You have beautiful things.\"",
                "\"Most of them come from my father, who lived in the golden age of\n      collectors. These histories of the unicorn, the complete series of which\n      is at Cluny, were found by my father in 1851 in an inn.\"",
                "But, curious and disappointed, she said: \"I see nothing that you have\n      done; not a statue, not one of those wax figures which are prized so\n      highly in England, not a figurine nor a plaque nor a medal.\"",
                "\"If you think I could find any pleasure in living among my works! I know\n      my figures too well -- they weary me. Whatever is without secret lacks\n      charm.\" She looked at him with affected spite.",
                "\"You had not told me that one had lost all charm when one had no more\n      secrets.\"",
                "He put his arm around her waist.",
                "\"Ah! The things that live are only too mysterious; and you remain for me,\n      my beloved, an enigma, the unknown sense of which contains the light of\n      life. Do not fear to give yourself to me. I shall desire you always, but I\n      never shall know you. Does one ever possess what one loves? Are kisses,\n      caresses, anything else than the effort of a delightful despair? When I\n      embrace you, I am still searching for you, and I never have you; since I\n      want you always, since in you I expect the impossible and the infinite.\n      What you are, the devil knows if I shall ever know! Because I have\n      modelled a few bad figures I am not a sculptor; I am rather a sort of poet\n      and philosopher who seeks for subjects of anxiety and torment in nature.\n      The sentiment of form is not sufficient for me. My colleagues laugh at me\n      because I have not their simplicity. They are right. And that brute\n      Choulette is right too, when he says we ought to live without thinking and\n      without desiring. Our friend the cobbler of Santa Maria Novella, who knows\n      nothing of what might make him unjust and unfortunate, is a master of the\n      art of living. I ought to love you naively, without that sort of\n      metaphysics which is passional and makes me absurd and wicked. There is\n      nothing good except to ignore and to forget. Come, come, I have thought of\n      you too cruelly in the tortures of your absence; come, my beloved! I must\n      forget you with you. It is with you only that I can forget you and lose\n      myself.\"",

This\n      bronze is a gift of Napoleon III. My parents went to Compiegne. My father,\n      while the court was at Fontainebleau, made the plan of the castle, and\n      designed the gallery. In the morning the Emperor would come, in his\n      frock-coat, and smoking his meerschaum pipe, to sit near him like a\n      penguin on a rock. At that time I went to day-school. I listened to his\n      stories at table, and I have not forgotten them. The Emperor stayed there,\n      peaceful and quiet, interrupting his long silence with few words smothered\n      under his big moustache; then he roused himself a little and explained his\n      ideas of machinery. He was an inventor. He would draw a pencil from his\n      pocket and make drawings on my father's designs. He spoiled in that way\n      two or three studies a week. He liked my father a great deal, and promised\n      works and honors to him which never came. The Emperor was kind, but he had\n      no influence, as mamma said. At that time I was a little boy. Since then a\n      vague sympathy has remained in me for that man, who was lacking in genius,\n      but whose mind was affectionate and beautiful, and who carried through\n      great adventures a simple courage and a gentle fatalism. Then he is\n      sympathetic to me because he has been combated and insulted by people who\n      were eager to take his place, and who had not, as he had, in the depths of\n      their souls, a love for the people. We have seen them in power since then.\n      Heavens, how ugly they are! Senator Loyer, for instance, who at your\n      house, in the smoking-room, filled his pockets with cigars, and invited me\n      to do likewise. That Loyer is a bad man, harsh to the unfortunate, to the\n      weak, and to the humble. And Garain, don't you think his mind is\n      disgusting? Do you remember the first time I dined at your house and we\n      talked of Napoleon? Your hair, twisted above your neck, and shot through\n      by a diamond arrow, was adorable. Paul Vence said subtle things. Garain\n      did not understand. You asked for my opinion.\"",
                "\"It was to make you shine. I was already conceited for you.\"",
                "\"Oh, I never could say a single phrase before people who are so serious.\n      Yet I had a great desire to say that Napoleon III pleased me more than\n      Napoleon I; that I thought him more touching; but perhaps that idea would\n      have produced a bad effect. But I am not so destitute of talent as to care\n      about politics.\"",

After an hour\n      she drew back the red satin draperies; rays of light dazzled her eyes and\n      fell on her floating hair. She looked for a mirror and found only a\n      looking-glass of Venice, dull in its wide ebony border. Rising on the tips\n      of her toes to see herself in it, she said:",

                "After her return to Paris, for six weeks Therese lived in the ardent half\n      sleep of happiness, and prolonged delightfully her thoughtless dream. She\n      went to see Jacques every day in the little house shaded by a tree; and\n      when they had at last parted at night, she took away with her adored\n      reminiscences. They had the same tastes; they yielded to the same\n      fantasies. The same capricious thoughts carried them away. They found\n      pleasure in running to the suburbs that border the city, the streets where\n      the wine-shops are shaded by acacia, the stony roads where the grass grows\n      at the foot of walls, the little woods and the fields over which extended\n      the blue sky striped by the smoke of manufactories. She was happy to feel\n      him near her in this region where she did not know herself, and where she\n      gave to herself the illusion of being lost with him.",
                "One day they had taken the boat that she had seen pass so often under her\n      windows. She was not afraid of being recognized. Her danger was not great,\n      and, since she was in love, she had lost prudence. They saw shores which\n      little by little grew gay, escaping the dusty aridity of the suburbs; they\n      went by islands with bouquets of trees shading taverns, and innumerable\n      boats tied under willows. They debarked at Bas-Meudon. As she said she was\n      warm and thirsty, he made her enter a wine-shop. It was a building with\n      wooden galleries, which solitude made to appear larger, and which slept in\n      rustic peace, waiting for Sunday to fill it with the laughter of girls,\n      the cries of boatmen, the odor of fried fish, and the smoke of stews.",
                "They went up the creaking stairway, shaped like a ladder, and in a\n      first-story room a maid servant brought wine and biscuits to them. On the\n      mantelpiece, at one of the corners of the room, was an oval mirror in a\n      flower-covered frame. Through the open window one saw the Seine, its green\n      shores, and the hills in the distance bathed with warm air. The trembling\n      peace of a summer evening filled the sky, the earth, and the water.",
                "Therese looked at the running river. The boat passed on the water, and\n      when the wake which it left reached the shore it seemed as if the house\n      rocked like a vessel.",

It\n      was not because of her beauty, although it was rare and infinitely\n      precious. She had exquisite lines, but lines follow movement, and escape\n      incessantly; they are lost and found again; they cause aesthetic joys and\n      despair. A beautiful line is the lightning which deliciously wounds the\n      eyes. One admires and one is surprised. What makes one love is a soft and\n      terrible force, more powerful than beauty. One finds one woman among a\n      thousand whom one wants always. Therese was that woman whom one can not\n      leave or betray.",

But if you wish to think that I am a great\n      artist, I will give you other reasons. To create a figure that will live,\n      one must take the model like common material from which one will extract\n      the beauty, press it, crush it, and obtain its essence. There is nothing\n      in you that is not precious to me. If I made your bust I should be\n      servilely attached to these things which are everything to me because they\n      are something of you.

She recalled smilingly a\n      night when she had arrived at Madame Garain's at half-past eight. She had\n      feared to cause a scandal. But it was a day of great affairs. Her husband\n      came from the Chamber at nine o'clock only, with Garain. They dined in\n      morning dress. They had saved the Ministry.",

The beauty of the day threw a ray of sunlight on the tomb of\n      Chateaubriand. In a room where a balcony looked out upon the beach, the\n      ocean, the islands, and the promontories, Therese was reading the letters\n      which she had found in the morning at the St. Malo post-office, and which\n      she had not opened in the boat, loaded with passengers. At once, after\n      breakfast, she had closeted herself in her room, and there, her letters\n      unfolded on her knees, she relished hastily her furtive joy. She was to\n      drive at two o'clock on the mall with her father, her husband, the\n      Princess Seniavine; Madame Berthier-d'Eyzelles, the wife of the Deputy,\n      and Madame Raymond, the wife of the Academician. She had two letters that\n      day. The first one she read exhaled a tender aroma of love. Jacques had\n      never displayed more simplicity, more happiness, and more charm.",
                "Since he had been in love with her, he said, he had walked so lightly and\n      was supported by such joy that his feet did not touch the earth. He had\n      only one fear, which was that he might be dreaming, and might awake\n      unknown to her. Doubtless he was only dreaming. And what a dream! He was\n      like one intoxicated and singing. He had not his reason, happily. Absent,\n      he saw her continually. \"Yes, I see you near me; I see your lashes shading\n      eyes the gray of which is more delicious than all the blue of the sky and\n      the flowers; your lips, which have the taste of a marvellous fruit; your\n      cheeks, where laughter puts two adorable dimples; I see you beautiful and\n      desired, but fleeing and gliding away; and when I open my arms, you have\n      gone; and I see you afar on the long, long beach, not taller than a fairy,\n      in your pink gown, under your parasol. Oh, so small! -- small as you\n      were one day when I saw you from the height of the Campanile in the square\n      at Florence. And I say to myself, as I said that day: 'A bit of grass\n      would suffice to hide her from me, yet she is for me the infinite of joy\n      and of pain.'\"",
                "He complained of the torments of absence. And he mingled with his\n      complaints the smiles of fortunate love. He threatened jokingly to\n      surprise her at Dinard. \"Do not be afraid. They will not recognize me. I\n      shall be disguised as a vender of plaster images. It will not be a lie.\n      Dressed in gray tunic and trousers, my beard and face covered with white\n      dust, I shall ring the bell of the Montessuy villa. You may recognize me,\n      Therese, by the statuettes on the plank placed on my head. They will all\n      be cupids. There will be faithful Love, jealous Love, tender Love, vivid\n      Love; there will be many vivid Loves.

I have culled a branch of the boxwood at which\n      you looked. In this city, where you are not, I see only you.\"",
                "He said at the end of his letter that he was to dine out. In the absence\n      of Madame Fusellier, who had gone to the country, he should go to a\n      wine-shop of the Rue Royale where he was known. And there, in the\n      indistinct crowd, he should be alone with her.",

Jacques told it.\n      While taking breakfast in the Rue Royale he had met a former companion who\n      had just returned from the seaside. They had talked together; chance made\n      that man speak of the Countess Martin, whom he knew. And at once,\n      interrupting the narration, Jacques exclaimed: \"Therese, Therese, why did\n      you lie to me, since I was sure to learn some day that of which I alone\n      was ignorant? But the error is mine more than yours. The letter which you\n      put into the San Michele post-box, your meeting at the Florence station,\n      would have enlightened me if I had not obstinately retained my illusions\n      and disdained evidence.",

I did not ask you anything,\n      from fear that you might not be able to continue to lie; I was prudent;\n      and it has happened that an idiot suddenly, brutally, at a restaurant\n      table, has opened my eyes and forced me to know. Oh, now that I know, now\n      that I can not doubt, it seems to me that to doubt would be delicious! He\n      gave the name -- the name which I heard at Fiesole from Miss Bell, and\n      he added: 'Everybody knows about that.'",
                "\"So you loved him. You love him still! He is near you, doubtless. He goes\n      every year to the Dinard races. I have been told so. I see him. I see\n      everything. If you knew the images that worry me, you would say, 'He is\n      mad,' and you would take pity on me. Oh, how I should like to forget you\n      and everything! But I can not. You know very well I can not forget you\n      except with you. I see you incessantly with him. It is torture. I thought\n      I was unfortunate that night on the banks of the Arno. But I did not know\n      then what it is to suffer. To-day I know.\"",
                "As she finished reading that letter, Therese thought: \"A word thrown\n      haphazard has placed him in that condition, a word has made him despairing\n      and mad.\" She tried to think who might be the wretched fellow who could\n      have talked in that way. She suspected two or three young men whom Le\n      Menil had introduced to her once, warning her not to trust them. And with\n      one of the white and cold fits of anger she had inherited from her father\n      she said to herself: \"I must know who he is.\" In the meanwhile what was\n      she to do? Her lover in despair, mad, ill, she could not run to him,\n      embrace him, and throw herself on him with such an abandonment that he\n      would feel how entirely she was his, and be forced to believe in her.\n      Should she write? How much better it would be to go to him, to fall upon\n      his heart and say to him: \"Dare to believe I am not yours only!\" But she\n      could only write. She had hardly begun her letter when she heard voices\n      and laughter in the garden. Therese went down, tranquil and smiling; her\n      large straw hat threw on her face a transparent shadow wherein her gray\n      eyes shone.",
                "\"How beautiful she is!\" exclaimed Princess Seniavine. \"What a pity it is\n      we never see her! In the morning she is promenading in the alleys of Saint\n      Malo, in the afternoon she is closeted in her room. She runs away from\n      us.\"",
                "The coach turned around the large circle of the beach at the foot of the\n      villas and gardens on the hillside. And they saw at the left the ramparts\n      and the steeple of St. Malo rise from the blue sea. Then the coach went\n      into a road bordered by hedges, along which walked Dinard women, erect\n      under their wide headdresses.",
                "\"Unfortunately,\" said Madame Raymond, seated on the box by Montessuy's\n      side, \"old costumes are dying out. The fault is with the railways.\"",
                "\"It is true,\" said Montessuy, \"that if it were not for the railways the\n      peasants would still wear their picturesque costumes of other times. But\n      we should not see them.\"",
                "\"What does it matter?\" replied Madame Raymond. \"We could imagine them.\"",
                "\"But,\" asked the Princess Seniavine, \"do you ever see interesting things?\n      I never do.\"",
                "Madame Raymond, who had taken from her husband's books a vague tint of\n      philosophy, declared that things were nothing, and that the idea was\n      everything.",

                "\"But, my dear,\" said Count Martin, placed in front of her, by the\n      Princess's side, \"without leading ideas one would go haphazard. Have you\n      read, Montessuy, the speech delivered by Loyer at the unveiling of the\n      Cadet-Gassicourt statue? The beginning is remarkable. Loyer is not lacking\n      in political sense.\"",
                "The carriage, having traversed the fields bordered with willows, went up a\n      hill and advanced on a vast, wooded plateau. For a long time it skirted\n      the walls of the park.",
                "\"Is it the Guerric?\" asked the Princess Seniavine.",
                "Suddenly, between two stone pillars surmounted by lions, appeared the\n      closed gate. At the end of a long alley stood the gray stones of a castle.",
                "\"Yes,\" said Montessuy, \"it is the Guerric.\"",

                "\"You knew the Marquis de Re? At sixty-five he had retained his strength\n      and his youth. He set the fashion and was loved. Young men copied his\n      frockcoat, his monocle, his gestures, his exquisite insolence, his amusing\n      fads. Suddenly he abandoned society, closed his house, sold his stable,\n      ceased to show himself. Do you remember, Therese, his sudden\n      disappearance? You had been married a short time. He called on you often.\n      One fine day people learned that he had quitted Paris. This is the place\n      where he had come in winter. People tried to find a reason for his sudden\n      retreat; some thought he had run away under the influence of sorrow or\n      humiliation, or from fear that the world might see him grow old. He was\n      afraid of old age more than of anything else. For seven years he has lived\n      in retirement from society; he has not gone out of the castle once. He\n      receives at the Guerric two or three old men who were his companions in\n      youth. This gate is opened for them only. Since his retirement no one has\n      seen him; no one ever will see him. He shows the same care to conceal\n      himself that he had formerly to show himself. He has not suffered from his\n      decline. He exists in a sort of living death.\"",
                "And Therese, recalling the amiable old man who had wished to finish\n      gloriously with her his life of gallantry, turned her head and looked at\n      the Guerric lifting its four towers above the gray summits of oaks.",
                "On their return she said she had a headache and that she would not take\n      dinner. She locked herself in her room and drew from her jewel casket the\n      lamentable letter. She read over the last page.",
                "\"The thought that you belong to another burns me. And then, I did not wish\n      that man to be the one.\"",
                "It was a fixed idea. He had written three times on the same leaf these\n      words: \"I did not wish that man to be the one.\"",
                "She, too, had only one idea: not to lose him. Not to lose him, she would\n      have said anything, she would have done anything. She went to her table\n      and wrote, under the spur of a tender, and plaintive violence, a letter\n      wherein she repeated like a groan: \"I love you, I love you! I never have\n      loved any one but you. You are alone, alone -- do you hear? -- in my\n      mind, in me. Do not think of what that wretched man said. Listen to me! I\n      never loved any one, I swear, any one, before you.\"",
                "As she was writing, the soft sigh of the sea accompanied her own sigh. She\n      wished to say, she believed she was saying, real things; and all that she\n      was saying was true of the truth of her love. She heard the heavy step of\n      her father on the stairway. She hid her letter and opened the door.\n      Montessuy asked her whether she felt better.",
                "\"I came,\" he said, \"to say good-night to you, and to ask you something. It\n      is probable that I shall meet Le Menil at the races. He goes there every\n      year. If I meet him, darling, would you have any objection to my inviting\n      him to come here for a few days? Your husband thinks he would be agreeable\n      company for you. We might give him the blue room.\"",

The light air of\n      September agitated the curls of her hair, and the sun made golden darts\n      shine in the profound gray of her eyes. Behind them, the facade of the\n      palace displayed above the three arcades of the first story, in the\n      intervals of the windows, on long tables, busts of Roman emperors. The\n      house was placed between two tall pavilions which their great slate roofs\n      made higher, over pillars of the Ionic order. This style betrayed the art\n      of the architect Leveau, who had constructed, in 1650, the castle of\n      Joinville-sur-Oise for that rich Mareuilles, creature of Mazarin, and\n      fortunate accomplice of Fouquet.",

                "They found the alley which, with other lindens and other nymphs, went\n      beyond. And they followed it to the grottoes. There was, in the rear of\n      the park, a semicircle of five large niches of rocks surmounted by\n      balustrades and separated by gigantic Terminus gods. One of these gods, at\n      a corner of the monument, dominated all the others by his monstrous\n      nudity, and lowered on them his stony look.",
                "\"When my father bought Joinville,\" she said, \"the grottoes were only\n      ruins, full of grass and vipers. A thousand rabbits had made holes in\n      them. He restored the Terminus gods and the arcades in accordance with\n      prints by Perrelle, which are preserved at the Bibliotheque Nationale. He\n      was his own architect.\"",
                "A desire for shade and mystery led them toward the arbor near the\n      grottoes. But the noise of footsteps which they heard, coming from the\n      covered alley, made them stop for a moment, and they saw, through the\n      leaves, Montessuy, with his arm around the Princess Seniavine's waist.\n      Quietly they were walking toward the palace. Jacques and Therese, hiding\n      behind the enormous Terminus god, waited until they had passed.",
                "Then she said to Dechartre, who was looking at her silently:",
                "\"That is amazing! I understand now why the Princess Seniavine, this\n      winter, asked my father to advise her about buying horses.\"",
                "Yet Therese admired her father for having conquered that beautiful woman,\n      who passed for being hard to please, and who was known to be wealthy, in\n      spite of the embarrassments which her mad disorder had caused her. She\n      asked Jacques whether he did not think the Princess was beautiful. He said\n      she had elegance. She was beautiful, doubtless.",
                "Therese led Jacques to the moss-covered steps which, ascending behind the\n      grottoes, led to the Gerbe-de-l'Oise, formed of leaden reeds in the midst\n      of a great pink marble vase. Tall trees closed the park's perspective and\n      stood at the beginning of the forest. They walked under them. They were\n      silent under the faint moan of the leaves.",
                "He pressed her in his arms and placed kisses on her eyelids. Night was\n      descending, the first stars were trembling among the branches. In the damp\n      grass sighed the frog's flutes. They went no farther.",
                "When she took with him, in darkness, the road to the palace, the taste of\n      kisses and of mint remained on her lips, and in her eyes was the image of\n      her lover. She smiled under the lindens at the nymphs who had seen the\n      tears of her childhood. The Swan lifted in the sky its cross of stars, and\n      the moon mirrored its slender horn in the basin of the crown. Insects in\n      the grass uttered appeals to love. At the last turn of the boxwood hedge,\n      Therese and Jacques saw the triple black mass of the castle, and through\n      the wide bay-windows of the first story distinguished moving forms in the\n      red light. The bell rang.",
                "Therese exclaimed:",
                "\"I have hardly time to dress for dinner.\"",
                "And she passed swiftly between the stone lions, leaving her lover under\n      the impression of a fairy-tale vision.",
                "In the drawing-room, after dinner, M. Berthier d'Eyzelles read the\n      newspaper, and the Princess Seniavine played solitaire. Therese sat, her\n      eyes half closed over a book.",
                "The Princess asked whether she found what she was reading amusing.",
                "\"I do not know. I was reading and thinking. Paul Vence is right: 'We find\n      only ourselves in books.'\"",
                "Through the hangings came from the billiard-room the voices of the players\n      and the click of the balls.",
                "\"I have it!\" exclaimed the Princess, throwing down the cards.",
                "She had wagered a big sum on a horse which was running that day at the\n      Chantilly races.",
                "Therese said she had received a letter from Fiesole. Miss Bell announced\n      her forthcoming marriage with Prince Eusebia Albertinelli della Spina.",
                "The Princess laughed:",
                "\"There's a man who will render a service to her.\"",
                "\"What service?\" asked Therese.",
                "\"He will disgust her with men, of course.\"",
                "Montessuy came into the parlor joyfully. He had won the game.",
                "He sat beside Berthier-d'Eyzelles, and, taking a newspaper from the sofa,\n      said:",
                "\"The Minister of Finance announces that he will propose, when the Chamber\n      reassembles, his savings-bank bill.\"",
                "This bill was to give to savings-banks the authority to lend money to\n      communes, a proceeding which would take from Montessuy's business houses\n      their best customers.",
                "\"Berthier,\" asked the financier, \"are you resolutely hostile to that\n      bill?\"",
                "Berthier nodded.",
                "Montessuy rose, placed his hand on the Deputy's shoulder, and said:",
                "\"My dear Berthier, I have an idea that the Cabinet will fall at the\n      beginning of the session.\"",
                "He approached his daughter.",
                "\"I have received an odd letter from Le Menil.\"",
                "Therese rose and closed the door that separated the parlor from the\n      billiard-room.",
                "She was afraid of draughts, she said.",
                "\"A singular letter,\" continued Montessuy. \"Le Menil will not come to\n      Joinville. He has bought the yacht Rosebud. He is on the Mediterranean,\n      and can not live except on the water. It is a pity. He is the only one who\n      knows how to manage a hunt.\"",
                "At this instant Dechartre came into the room with Count Martin, who, after\n      beating him at billiards, had acquired a great affection for him and was\n      explaining to him the dangers of a personal tax based on the number of\n      servants one kept."

                "Madame Martin had at her right Garain the Deputy, formerly Chancellor,\n      also President of the Council, and at her left Senator Loyer. At Count\n      Martin-Belleme's right was Monsieur Berthier-d'Eyzelles. It was an\n      intimate and serious business gathering. In conformity with Montessuy's\n      prediction, the Cabinet had fallen four days before. Called to the Elysee\n      the same morning, Garain had accepted the task of forming a cabinet. He\n      was preparing, while taking breakfast, the combination which was to be\n      submitted in the evening to the President. And, while they were discussing\n      names, Therese was reviewing within herself the images of her intimate\n      life.",
                "She had returned to Paris with Count Martin at the opening of the\n      parliamentary session, and since that moment had led an enchanted life.",
                "Jacques loved her; he loved her with a delicious mingling of passion and\n      tenderness, of learned experience and curious ingenuity. He was nervous,\n      irritable, anxious. But the uncertainty of his humor made his gayety more\n      charming. That artistic gayety, bursting out suddenly like a flame,\n      caressed love without offending it. And the playful wit of her lover made\n      Therese marvel. She never could have imagined the infallible taste which\n      he exercised naturally in joyful caprice and in familiar fantasy. At first\n      he had displayed only the monotony of passionate ardor. That alone had\n      captured her. But since then she had discovered in him a gay mind, well\n      stored and diverse, as well as the gift of agreeable flattery.",
                "\"To assemble a homogeneous ministry,\" exclaimed Garain, \"is easily said.\n      Yet one must be guided by the tendencies of the various factions of the\n      Chamber.\"",
                "He was uneasy. He saw himself surrounded by as many snares as those which\n      he had laid. Even his collaborators became hostile to him.",
                "Count Martin wished the new ministry to satisfy the aspirations of the new\n      men.",
                "\"Your list is formed of personalities essentially different in origin and\n      in tendency,\" he said. \"Yet the most important fact in the political\n      history of recent years is the possibility, I should say the necessity, to\n      introduce unity of views in the government of the republic. These are\n      ideas which you, my dear Garin, have expressed with rare eloquence.\"",
                "M. Berthier-d'Eyzelles kept silence.",
                "Senator Loyer rolled crumbs with his fingers. He had been formerly a\n      frequenter of beer-halls, and while moulding crumbs or cutting corks he\n      found ideas. He raised his red face. And, looking at Garain with wrinkled\n      eyes wherein red fire sparkled, he said:",
                "\"I said it, and nobody would believe it. The annihilation of the\n      monarchical Right was for the chiefs of the Republican party an\n      irreparable misfortune. We governed formerly against it. The real support\n      of a government is the Opposition. The Empire governed against the\n      Orleanists and against us; MacMahon governed against the Republicans. More\n      fortunate, we governed against the Right. The Right -- what a\n      magnificent Opposition it was! It threatened, was candid, powerless,\n      great, honest, unpopular! We should have nursed it. We did not know how to\n      do that. And then, of course, everything wears out. Yet it is always\n      necessary to govern against something. There are to-day only Socialists to\n      give us the support which the Right lent us fifteen years ago with so\n      constant a generosity. But they are too weak. We should reenforce them,\n      make of them a political party. To do this at the present hour is the\n      first duty of a State minister.\"",
                "Garain, who was not cynical, made no answer.",
                "\"Garain, do you not yet know,\" asked Count Martin, \"whether with the\n      Premiership you are to take the Seals or the Interior?\"",
                "Garain replied that his decision would depend on the choice which some one\n      else would make. The presence of that personage in the Cabinet was\n      necessary, and he hesitated between two portfolios. Garain sacrificed his\n      personal convenience to superior interests.",
                "Senator Loyer made a wry face. He wanted the Seals. It was a\n      long-cherished desire. A teacher of law under the Empire, he gave, in\n      cafes, lessons that were appreciated. He had the sense of chicanery.\n      Having begun his political fortune with articles skilfully written in\n      order to attract to himself prosecution, suits, and several weeks of\n      imprisonment, he had considered the press as a weapon of opposition which\n      every good government should break. Since September 4, 1870, he had had\n      the ambition to become Keeper of the Seals, so that everybody might see\n      how the old Bohemian who formerly explained the code while dining on\n      sauerkraut, would appear as supreme chief of the magistracy.",
                "Idiots by the dozen had climbed over his back. Now having become aged in\n      the ordinary honors of the Senate, unpolished, married to a brewery girl,\n      poor, lazy, disillusioned, his old Jacobin spirit and his sincere contempt\n      for the people surviving his ambition, made of him a good man for the\n      Government. This time, as a part of the Garain combination, he imagined he\n      held the Department of Justice. And his protector, who would not give it\n      to him, was an unfortunate rival. He laughed, while moulding a dog from a\n      piece of bread.",
                "M. Berthier-d'Eyzelles, calm and grave, caressed his handsome white beard.",
                "\"Do you not think, Monsieur Garain, that it would be well to give a place\n      in the Cabinet to the men who have followed from the beginning the\n      political principles toward which we are directing ourselves to-day?\"",
                "\"They lost themselves in doing it,\" replied Garam, impatiently. \"The\n      politician never should be in advance of circumstances. It is an error to\n      be in the right too soon. Thinkers are not men of business. And then -- let\n      us talk frankly -- if you want a Ministry of the Left Centre variety,\n      say so: I will retire. But I warn you that neither the Chamber nor the\n      country will sustain you.\"",
                "\"It is evident,\" said Count Martin, \"that we must be sure of a majority.\"",
                "\"With my list, we have a majority,\" said Garain. \"It is the minority which\n      sustained the Ministry against us. Gentlemen, I appeal to your devotion.\"",
                "And the laborious distribution of the portfolios began again. Count Martin\n      received, in the first place, the Public Works, which he refused, for lack\n      of competency, and afterward the Foreign Affairs, which he accepted\n      without objection.",
                "But M. Berthier-d'Eyzelles, to whom Garain offered Commerce and\n      Agriculture, reserved his decision.",
                "Loyer got the Colonies. He seemed very busy trying to make his bread dog\n      stand on the cloth. Yet he was looking out of the corners of his little\n      wrinkled eyelids at the Countess Martin and thinking that she was\n      desirable. He vaguely thought of the pleasure of meeting her again.",
                "Leaving Garain to his combination, he was preoccupied by his fair hostess,\n      trying to divine her tastes and her habits, asking her whether she went to\n      the theatre, and if she ever went at night to the coffee-house with her\n      husband. And Therese was beginning to think he was more interesting than\n      the others, with his apparent ignorance of her world and his superb\n      cynicism.",
                "Gamin arose. He had to see several persons before submitting his list to\n      the President of the Republic. Count Martin offered his carriage, but\n      Garain had one.",
                "\"Do you not think,\" asked Count Martin, \"that the President might object\n      to some names?\"",
                "\"The President,\" replied Garain, \"will be inspired by the necessities of\n      the situation.\"",
                "He had already gone out of the door when he struck his forehead with his\n      hand.",
                "\"We have forgotten the Ministry of War.\"",
                "\"We shall easily find somebody for it among the generals,\" said Count\n      Martin.",
                "\"Ah,\" exclaimed Garain, \"you believe the choice of a minister of war is\n      easy. It is clear you have not, like me, been a member of three cabinets\n      and President of the Council. In my cabinets, and during my presidency the\n      greatest difficulties came from the Ministry of War. Generals are all\n      alike. You know the one I chose for the cabinet that I formed. When we\n      took him, he knew nothing of affairs. He hardly knew there were two\n      Chambers. We had to explain to him all the wheels of parliamentary\n      machinery; we had to teach him that there were an army committee, finance\n      committee, subcommittees, presidents of committees, a budget. He asked\n      that all this information be written for him on a piece of paper. His\n      ignorance of men and of things amazed and alarmed us. In a fortnight he\n      knew the most subtle tricks of the trade; he knew personally all the\n      senators and all the deputies, and was intriguing with them against us. If\n      it had not been for President Grevy's help, he would have overthrown us.\n      And he was a very ordinary general, a general like any other. Oh, no; do\n      not think that the portfolio of war may be given hastily, without\n      reflection.\"",
                "And Garain still shivered at the thought of his former colleague.",
                "Therese rose. Senator Loyer offered his arm to her, with the graceful\n      attitude that he had learned forty years before at Bullier's dancing-hall.\n      She left the politicians in the drawing-room, and hastened to meet\n      Dechartre.",
                "A rosy mist covered the Seine, the stone quays, and the gilded trees. The\n      red sun threw into the cloudy sky the last glories of the year. Therese,\n      as she went out, relished the sharpness of the air and the dying splendor\n      of the day. Since her return to Paris, happy, she found pleasure every\n      morning in the changes of the weather. It seemed to her, in her generous\n      selfishness, that it was for her the wind blew in the trees, or the fine,\n      gray rain wet the horizon of the avenues; for her, so that she might say,\n      as she entered the little house of the Ternes, \"It is windy; it is\n      raining; the weather is pleasant;\" mingling thus the ocean of things in\n      the intimacy of her love. And every day was beautiful for her, since each\n      one brought her to the arms of her beloved.",
                "While on her way that day to the little house of the Ternes she thought of\n      her unexpected happiness, so full and so secure. She walked in the last\n      glory of the sun already touched by winter, and said to herself:",
                "\"He loves me; I believe he loves me entirely. To love is easier and more\n      natural for him than for other men. They have in life ideas they think\n      superior to love -- faith, habits, interests. They believe in God, or\n      in duties, or in themselves. He believes in me only. I am his God, his\n      duty, and his life.\"",
                "Then she thought:",
                "\"It is true, too, that he needs nobody, not even me. His thoughts alone\n      are a magnificent world in which he could easily live by himself. But I\n      can not live without him. What would become of me if I did not have him?\"",
                "She was not alarmed by the violent passion that he had for her. She\n      recalled that she had said to him one day: \"Your love for me is only\n      sensual. I do not complain of it; it is perhaps the only true love.\" And\n      he had replied: \"It is also the only grand and strong love. It has its\n      measure and its weapons. It is full of meaning and of images. It is\n      violent and mysterious. It attaches itself to the flesh and to the soul of\n      the flesh. The rest is only illusion and untruth.\" She was almost tranquil\n      in her joy. Suspicions and anxieties had fled like the mists of a summer\n      storm. The worst weather of their love had come when they had been\n      separated from each other. One should never leave the one whom one loves.",
                "At the corner of the Avenue Marceau and of the Rue Galilee, she divined\n      rather than recognized a shadow that had passed by her, a forgotten form.\n      She thought, she wished to think, she was mistaken. The one whom she\n      thought she had seen existed no longer, never had existed. It was a\n      spectre seen in the limbo of another world, in the darkness of a half\n      light. And she continued to walk, retaining of this ill-defined meeting an\n      impression of coldness, of vague embarrassment, and of pain in the heart.",
                "As she proceeded along the avenue she saw coming toward her newspaper\n      carriers holding the evening sheets announcing the new Cabinet. She\n      traversed the square; her steps followed the happy impatience of her\n      desire. She had visions of Jacques waiting for her at the foot of the\n      stairway, among the marble figures; taking her in his arms and carrying\n      her, trembling from kisses, to that room full of shadows and of delights,\n      where the sweetness of life made her forget life.",
                "But in the solitude of the Avenue MacMahon, the shadow which she had seen\n      at the corner of the Rue Galilee came near her with a directness that was\n      unmistakable.",
                "She recognized Robert Le Menil, who, having followed her from the quay,\n      was stopping her at the most quiet and secure place.",
                "His air, his attitude, expressed the simplicity of motive which had\n      formerly pleased Therese. His face, naturally harsh, darkened by sunburn,\n      somewhat hollowed, but calm, expressed profound suffering.",
                "\"I must speak to you.\"",
                "She slackened her pace. He walked by her side.",
                "\"I have tried to forget you. After what had happened it was natural, was\n      it not? I have done all I could. It was better to forget you, surely; but\n      I could not. So I bought a boat, and I have been travelling for six\n      months. You know, perhaps?\"",
                "She made a sign that she knew.",
                "He continued:",
                "\"The Rosebud, a beautiful yacht. There were six men in the crew. I\n      manoeuvred with them. It was a pastime.\"",
                "He paused. She was walking slowly, saddened, and, above all, annoyed. It\n      seemed to her an absurd and painful thing, beyond all expression, to have\n      to listen to such words from a stranger.",
                "He continued:",
                "\"What I suffered on that boat I should be ashamed to tell you.\"",
                "She felt he spoke the truth.",
                "\"Oh, I forgive you -- I have reflected alone a great deal. I passed\n      many nights and days on the divan of the deckhouse, turning always the\n      same ideas in my mind. For six months I have thought more than I ever did\n      in my life. Do not laugh. There is nothing like suffering to enlarge the\n      mind. I understand that if I have lost you the fault is mine. I should\n      have known how to keep you. And I said to myself: 'I did not know. Oh; if\n      I could only begin again!' By dint of thinking and of suffering, I\n      understand. I know now that I did not sufficiently share your tastes and\n      your ideas. You are a superior woman. I did not notice it before, because\n      it was not for that that I loved you. Without suspecting it, I irritated\n      you.\"",
                "She shook her head. He insisted.",
                "\"Yes, yes, I often wounded your feelings. I did not consider your\n      delicacy. There were misunderstandings between us. The reason was, we have\n      not the same temperament. And then, I did not know how to amuse you. I did\n      not know how to give you the amusement you need. I did not procure for you\n      the pleasures that a woman as intelligent as you requires.\"",
                "So simple and so true was he in his regrets and in his pain, she found him\n      worthy of sympathy. She said to him, softly:",
                "\"My friend, I never had reason to complain of you.\"",

                "\"All I have said to you is true. I understood this when I was alone in my\n      boat. I have spent hours on it to which I would not condemn my worst\n      enemy. Often I felt like throwing myself into the water. I did not do it.\n      Was it because I have religious principles or family sentiments, or\n      because I have no courage? I do not know. The reason is, perhaps, that\n      from a distance you held me to life. I was attracted by you, since I am\n      here. For two days I have been watching you. I did not wish to reappear at\n      your house. I should not have found you alone; I should not have been able\n      to talk to you. And then you would have been forced to receive me. I\n      thought it better to speak to you in the street. The idea came to me on\n      the boat. I said to myself: 'In the street she will listen to me only if\n      she wishes, as she wished four years ago in the park of Joinville, you\n      know, under the statues, near the crown.'\"",

The sombre drapery of the boxes framed the dazzling\n      heads and bare shoulders of women. The amphitheatre bent above the\n      parquette its garland of diamonds, hair, gauze, and satin. In the\n      proscenium boxes were the wife of the Austrian Ambassador and the Duchess\n      Gladwin; in the amphitheatre Berthe d'Osigny and Jane Tulle, the latter\n      made famous the day before by the suicide of one of her lovers; in the\n      boxes, Madame Berard de La Malle, her eyes lowered, her long eyelashes\n      shading her pure cheeks; Princess Seniavine, who, looking superb,\n      concealed under her fan panther -- like yawnings; Madame de Morlaine,\n      between two young women whom she was training in the elegances of the\n      mind; Madame Meillan, resting assured on thirty years of sovereign beauty;\n      Madame Berthier d'Eyzelles, erect under iron-gray hair sparkling with\n      diamonds. The bloom of her cheeks heightened the austere dignity of her\n      attitude. She was attracting much notice. It had been learned in the\n      morning that, after the failure of Garain's latest combination, M.\n      Berthier-d'Eyzelles had, undertaken the task of forming a Ministry. The\n      papers published lists with the name of Martin-Belleme for the treasury,\n      and the opera-glasses were turned toward the still empty box of the\n      Countess Martin.",
                "A murmur of voices filled the hall. In the third rank of the parquette,\n      General Lariviere, standing at his place, was talking with General de La\n      Briche.",

                "He was in one of his moments of melancholy, when nothingness appeared to\n      him to be the end of life. He had flattered Garain, and Garain, thinking\n      him too clever, had preferred for Minister of War a shortsighted and\n      national artillery general. At least, the General relished the pleasure of\n      seeing Garain abandoned, betrayed by his friends Berthier-d'Eyzelles and\n      Martin-Belleme. It made him laugh even to the wrinkles of his small eyes.\n      He laughed in profile. Weary of a long life of dissimulation, he gave to\n      himself suddenly the joy of expressing his thoughts.",
                "\"You see, my good La Briche, they make fools of us with their civil army,\n      which costs a great deal, and is worth nothing. Small armies are the only\n      good ones. This was the opinion of Napoleon I, who knew.\"",

                "However, in the hall, in the corridors, the names of the new Ministers\n      went from mouth to mouth in the midst of profound indifference: President\n      of the Council and Minister of the Interior, Berthier-d'Eyzelles; justice\n      and Religions, Loyer; Treasury, Martin-Belleme. All the ministers were\n      known except those of Commerce, War, and the Navy, who were not yet\n      designated.",
                "The curtain was raised on the wine-shop of Bacchus. The students were\n      singing their second chorus when Madame Martin appeared in her box. Her\n      white gown had sleeves like wings, and on the drapery of her corsage, at\n      the left breast, shone a large ruby lily.",

But how\n      could Professor Arrighi forget you, darling, since the trees in the garden\n      have not forgotten you? Their unleaved branches lament your absence.

                "The curtain fell on the gayety of the waltz scene. Visitors crowded the\n      foyers. Financiers, artists, deputies met in the anteroom adjoining the\n      box. They surrounded M. Martin-Belleme, murmured polite congratulations,\n      made graceful gestures to him, and crowded one another in order to shake\n      his hand. Joseph Schmoll, coughing, complaining, blind and deaf, made his\n      way through the throng and reached Madame Martin. He took her hand and\n      said:",
                "\"They say your husband is appointed Minister. Is it true?\"",
                "She knew they were talking of it, but she did not think he had been\n      appointed yet. Her husband was there, why not ask him?",
                "Sensitive to literal truths only, Schmoll said:",
                "\"Your husband is not yet a Minister? When he is appointed, I will ask you\n      for an interview. It is an affair of the highest importance.\"",
                "He paused, throwing from his gold spectacles the glances of a blind man\n      and of a visionary, which kept him, despite the brutal exactitude of his\n      temperament, in a sort of mystical state of mind. He asked, brusquely:",

You have looked at the arch of the\n      infamous Titus, that execrable monument, where one may see the\n      seven-branched candlestick among the spoils of the Jews. Well, Madame, it\n      is a shame to the world that that monument remains standing in the city of\n      Rome, where the Popes have subsisted only through the art of the Jews,\n      financiers and money-changers. The Jews brought to Italy the science of\n      Greece and of the Orient. The Renaissance, Madame, is the work of Israel.\n      That is the truth, certain but misunderstood.\"",
                "And he went through the crowd of visitors, crushing hats as he passed.",
                "Princess Seniavine looked at her friend from her box with the curiosity\n      that the beauty of women at times excited in her. She made a sign to Paul\n      Vence who was near her:",

                "La Briche remained pensive for a moment. Then he said:",
                "\"He came this summer to Semanville. I thought him odd. A charming fellow,\n      frank and intelligent. But he ought to have some occupation, some aim in\n      life.\"",
                "The bell which announced the end of an intermission between the acts had\n      hushed. In the foyer the two old men were walking alone.",
                "\"An aim in life,\" repeated La Briche, tall, thin, and bent, while his\n      companion, lightened and rejuvenated, hastened within, fearing to miss a\n      scene.",
                "Marguerite, in the garden, was spinning and singing. When she had\n      finished, Miss Bell said to Madame Martin:",
                "\"Darling, Monsieur Choulette has written me a perfectly beautiful letter.\n      He has told me that he is very celebrated. And I am glad to know it. He\n      said also: 'The glory of other poets reposes in myrrh and aromatic plants.\n      Mine bleeds and moans under a rain of stones and of oyster-shells.' Do the\n      French, my love, really throw stones at Monsieur Choulette?\"",
                "While Therese reassured Miss Bell, Loyer, imperious and somewhat noisy,\n      caused the door of the box to be opened. He appeared wet and spattered\n      with mud.",
                "\"I come from the Elysee,\" he said.",

                "\"No; Berthier praised the hereditary property of the Martins, your\n      caution, and the links with which you are attached to certain\n      personalities in the financial world whose concurrence may be useful to\n      the government. And the President, in accordance with Garain's happy\n      expression, was inspired by the necessities of the situation. He has\n      signed.\"",
                "On Count Martin's yellowed face two or three wrinkles appeared. He was\n      smiling.",
                "\"The decree,\" continued Loyer, \"will be published tomorrow. I accompanied\n      myself the clerk who took it to the printer. It was surer.

                "And Loyer threw himself on a chair. There, enjoying the view of Madame\n      Martin, he continued:",
                "\"People will not say, as they did in the time of my poor friend Gambetta,\n      that the republic is lacking in women. You will give us fine festivals,\n      Madame, in the salons of the Ministry.\"",
                "Marguerite, looking at herself in the mirror, with her necklace and\n      earrings, was singing the jewel song.",
                "\"We shall have to compose the declaration,\" said Count Martin. \"I have\n      thought of it. For my department I have found, I think, a fine formula.\"",

                "He thought he could find him in the boulevard cafe, where military men go.\n      But Count Martin knew the General was in the theatre.",

                "\"Oh, no,\" she replied.",
                "\"At least, Madame,\" said Paul Vence, \"you will go to the balls at the\n      Elysees, and we shall admire the art with which you retain your mysterious\n      charm.\"",
                "\"Changes in cabinets,\" said Madame Martin, \"inspire you, Monsieur Vence,\n      with very frivolous reflections.\"",
                "\"Madame,\" continued Paul Vence, \"I shall not say like Renan, my beloved\n      master: 'What does Sirius care?' because somebody would reply with reason\n      'What does little Earth care for big Sirius?'

And, what is still more marvellous, people imagine they\n      have other chiefs of state and other ministers than their miseries, their\n      desires, and their imbecility. He was a wise man who said: 'Let us give to\n      men irony and pity as witnesses and judges.'\"",

                "Two ballet-dancers were standing sadly, with a foot on the bar placed\n      against the wall. Here and there men in evening dress and women in gauze\n      formed groups almost silent.",
                "Loyer and Martin-Belleme, when they entered, took off their hats. They\n      saw, in the rear of the hall, Lariviere with a pretty girl whose pink\n      tunic, held by a gold belt, was open at the hips.",
                "She held in her hand a gilt pasteboard cup. When they were near her, they\n      heard her say to the General:",

                "And she was pointing disdainfully to a grinning young man, with a gardenia\n      in his button-hole, who stood near them.",
                "Loyer motioned to the General that he wished to speak to him, and, pushing\n      him against the bar, said:",

                "Lariviere, distrustful, said nothing. That badly dressed man with long\n      hair, who, under his dusty coat, resembled a clown, inspired so little\n      confidence in him that he suspected a snare, perhaps a bad joke.",

                "\"General, you cannot refuse,\" Loyer said. \"I have said you will accept. If\n      you hesitate, it will be favoring the offensive return of Garain. He is a\n      traitor.\"",
                "\"My dear colleague, you exaggerate,\" said Count Martin; \"but Garain,\n      perhaps, is lacking a little in frankness. And the General's support is\n      urgent.\"",

                "\"The use of big armies,\" continued Loyer, \"is to make war impossible. One\n      would be crazy to engage in a war these immeasurable forces, the\n      management of which surpasses all human faculty. Is not this your opinion,\n      General?\"",

                "\"Transmit, I pray you, Madame, my congratulations to your husband.\"",
                "He complimented her on her fine appearance. He spoke to Miss Bell a few\n      courteous and precise words.",
                "Therese listened anxiously, her mouth half open in the painful effort to\n      say insignificant things in reply. He asked her whether she had had a good\n      season at Joinville. He would have liked to go in the hunting time, but\n      could not. He had gone to the Mediterranean, then he had hunted at\n      Semanville.",
                "\"Oh, Monsieur Le Menil,\" said Miss Bell, \"you have wandered on the blue\n      sea. Have you seen sirens?\"",
                "No, he had not seen sirens, but for three days a dolphin had swum in the\n      yacht's wake.",
                "Miss Bell asked him if that dolphin liked music.",
                "He thought not.",
                "\"Dolphins,\" he said, \"are very ordinary fish that sailors call sea-geese,\n      because they have goose-shaped heads.\"",
                "But Miss Bell would not believe that the monster which had earned the poet\n      Arion had a goose-shaped head.",
                "\"Monsieur Le Menil, if next year a dolphin comes to swim near your boat, I\n      pray you play to him on the flute the Delphic Hymn to Apollo. Do you like\n      the sea, Monsieur Le Menil?\"",
                "\"I prefer the woods.\"",
                "Self-contained, simple, he talked quietly.",
                "\"Oh, Monsieur Le Menil, I know you like woods where the hares dance in the\n      moonlight.\"",
                "Dechartre, pale, rose and went out.",
                "The church scene was on. Marguerite, kneeling, was wringing her hands, and\n      her head drooped with the weight of her long tresses. The voices of the\n      organ and the chorus sang the death-song.",
                "\"Oh, darling, do you know that that death-song, which is sung only in the\n      Catholic churches, comes from a Franciscan hermitage? It sounds like the\n      wind which blows in winter in the trees on the summit of the Alverno.\"",
                "Therese did not hear. Her soul had followed Dechartre through the door of\n      her box.",
                "In the anteroom was a noise of overthrown chairs. It was Schmoll coming\n      back. He had learned that M. Martin-Belleme had recently been appointed\n      Minister. At once he claimed the cross of Commander of the Legion of Honor\n      and a larger apartment at the Institute. His apartment was small, narrow,\n      insufficient for his wife and his five daughters. He had been forced to\n      put his workshop under the roof. He made long complaints, and consented to\n      go only after Madame Martin had promised that she would speak to her\n      husband.",
                "\"Monsieur Le Menil,\" asked Miss Bell, \"shall you go yachting next year?\"",
                "Le Menil thought not. He did not intend to keep the Rosebud. The water was\n      tiresome.",
                "And calm, energetic, determined, he looked at Therese.",
                "On the stage, in Marguerite's prison, Mephistopheles sang, and the\n      orchestra imitated the gallop of horses. Therese murmured:",
                "\"I have a headache. It is too warm here.\"",
                "Le Menil opened the door.",
                "The clear phrase of Marguerite calling the angels ascended to heaven in\n      white sparks.",
                "\"Darling, I will tell you that poor Marguerite does not wish to be saved\n      according to the flesh, and for that reason she is saved in spirit and in\n      truth. I believe one thing, darling, I believe firmly we shall all be\n      saved. Oh, yes, I believe in the final purification of sinners.\"",
                "Therese rose, tall and white, with the red flower at her breast. Miss\n      Bell, immovable, listened to the music. Le Menil, in the anteroom, took\n      Madame Martin's cloak, and, while he held it unfolded, she traversed the\n      box, the anteroom, and stopped before the mirror of the half-open door. He\n      placed on her bare shoulders the cape of red velvet embroidered with gold\n      and lined with ermine, and said, in a low tone, but distinctly:",
                "\"Therese, I love you. Remember what I asked you the day before yesterday.\n      I shall be every day, at three o'clock, at our home, in the Rue Spontini.\"",
                "At this moment, as she made a motion with her head to receive the cloak,\n      she saw Dechartre with his hand on the knob of the door. He had heard. He\n      looked at her with all the reproach and suffering that human eyes can\n      contain. Then he went into the dim corridor. She felt hammers of fire\n      beating in her chest and remained immovable on the threshold.",
                "\"You were waiting for me?\" said Montessuy. \"You are left alone to-day. I\n      will escort you and Miss Bell.\""

                "In the carriage, and in her room, she saw again the look of her lover,\n      that cruel and dolorous look. She knew with what facility he fell into\n      despair, the promptness of his will not to will. She had seen him run away\n      thus on the shore of the Arno. Happy then in her sadness and in her\n      anguish, she could run after him and say, \"Come.\" Now, again surrounded,\n      watched, she should have found something to say, and not have let him go\n      from her dumb and desolate. She had remained surprised, stunned. The\n      accident had been so absurd and so rapid! She had against Le Menil the\n      sentiment of simple anger which malicious things cause. She reproached\n      herself bitterly for having permitted her lover to go without a word,\n      without a glance, wherein she could have placed her soul.",
                "While Pauline waited to undress her, Therese walked to and fro\n      impatiently. Then she stopped suddenly. In the obscure mirrors, wherein\n      the reflections of the candles were drowned, she saw the corridor of the\n      playhouse, and her beloved flying from her through it.",
                "Where was he now? What was he saying to himself alone? It was torture for\n      her not to be able to rejoin him and see him again at once.",
                "She pressed her heart with her hands; she was smothering.",
                "Pauline uttered a cry. She saw drops of blood on the white corsage of her\n      mistress.",
                "Therese, without knowing it, had pricked her hand with the red lily.",
                "She detached the emblematic jewel which she had worn before all as the\n      dazzling secret of her heart, and, holding it in her fingers, contemplated\n      it for a long time. Then she saw again the days of Florence -- the cell\n      of San Marco, where her lover's kiss weighed delicately on her mouth,\n      while, through her lowered lashes, she vaguely perceived again the angels\n      and the sky painted on the wall, and the dazzling fountain of the\n      ice-vender against the bright cloth; the pavilion of the Via Alfieri, its\n      nymphs, its goats, and the room where the shepherds and the masks on the\n      screens listened to her sighs and noted her long silences.",
                "No, all these things were not shadows of the past, spectres of ancient\n      hours. They were the present reality of her love. And a word stupidly cast\n      by a stranger would destroy these beautiful things! Happily, it was not\n      possible. Her love, her lover, did not depend on such insignificant\n      matters. If only she could run to his house! She would find him before the\n      fire, his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, sad. Then she would\n      run her fingers through his hair, force him to lift his head, to see that\n      she loved him, that she was his treasure, palpitating with joy and love.",
                "She had dismissed her maid. In her bed she thought of only one thing.",
                "It was an accident, an absurd accident. He would understand it; he would\n      know that their love had nothing to do with anything so stupid. What folly\n      for him to care about another! As if there were other men in the world!",
                "M. Martin-Belleme half opened the bedroom door. Seeing a light he went in.",

                "He had been at a conference with his colleagues. He wanted advice from his\n      wife on certain points. He needed to hear sincere words.",
                "\"It is done,\" he said. \"You will help me, I am sure, in my situation,\n      which is much envied, but very difficult and even perilous. I owe it to\n      you somewhat, since it came to me through the powerful influence of your\n      father.\"",
                "He consulted her on the choice of a Chief of Cabinet.",
                "She advised him as best she could. She thought he was sensible, calm, and\n      not sillier than many others.",
                "He lost himself in reflections.",
                "\"I have to defend before the Senate the budget voted by the Chamber of\n      Deputies. The budget contains innovations which I did not approve. When I\n      was a deputy I fought against them. Now that I am a minister I must\n      support them. I saw things from the outside formerly. I see them from the\n      inside now, and their aspect is changed. And, then, I am free no longer.\"",

                "Loyer had odd sallies of wit. Immediately after he had declared his strict\n      adhesion to the Concordat, he said: \"Bishops are spiritual prefects. I\n      will protect them since they belong to me. And through them I shall hold\n      the guardians of souls, curates.\"",
                "He recalled to her that she would have to meet people who were not of her\n      class and who would shock her by their vulgarity. But his situation\n      demanded that he should not disdain anybody. At all events, he counted on\n      her tact and on her devotion.",
                "She looked at him, a little astonished.",
                "\"There is no hurry, my dear. We shall see later.\"",
                "He was tired. He said good-night and advised her to sleep. She was ruining\n      her health by reading all night. He left her.",
                "She heard the noise of his footsteps, heavier than usual, while he\n      traversed the library, encumbered with blue books and journals, to reach\n      his room, where he would perhaps sleep. Then she felt the weight on her of\n      the night's silence. She looked at her watch. It was half-past one.",
                "She said to herself: \"He, too, is suffering. He looked at me with so much\n      despair and anger.\"",
                "She was courageous and ardent. She was impatient at being a prisoner. When\n      daylight came, she would go, she would see him, she would explain\n      everything to him. It was so clear! In the painful monotony of her\n      thought, she listened to the rolling of wagons which at long intervals\n      passed on the quay. That noise preoccupied, almost interested her. She\n      listened to the rumble, at first faint and distant, then louder, in which\n      she could distinguish the rolling of the wheels, the creaking of the\n      axles, the shock of horses' shoes, which, decreasing little by little,\n      ended in an imperceptible murmur.",
                "And when silence returned, she fell again into her reverie.",
                "He would understand that she loved him, that she had never loved any one\n      except him. It was unfortunate that the night was so long. She did not\n      dare to look at her watch for fear of seeing in it the immobility of time.",
                "She rose, went to the window, and drew the curtains. There was a pale\n      light in the clouded sky. She thought it might be the beginning of dawn.\n      She looked at her watch. It was half-past three.",
                "She returned to the window. The sombre infinity outdoors attracted her.\n      She looked. The sidewalks shone under the gas-jets. A gentle rain was\n      falling. Suddenly a voice ascended in the silence; acute, and then grave,\n      it seemed to be made of several voices replying to one another. It -- was\n      a drunkard disputing with the beings of his dream, to whom he generously\n      gave utterance, and whom he confounded afterward with great gestures and\n      in furious sentences. Therese could see the poor man walk along the\n      parapet in his white blouse, and she could hear words recurring\n      incessantly: \"That is what I say to the government.\"",
                "Chilled, she returned to her bed. She thought, \"He is jealous, he is madly\n      jealous. It is a question of nerves and of blood. But his love, too, is an\n      affair of blood and of nerves. His love and his jealousy are one and the\n      same thing. Another would understand. It would be sufficient to please his\n      self-love.\" But he was jealous from the depth of his soul. She knew this;\n      she knew that in him jealousy was a physical torture, a wound enlarged by\n      imagination. She knew how profound the evil was. She had seen him grow\n      pale before the bronze St. Mark when she had thrown the letter in the box\n      on the wall of the old Florentine house at a time when she was his only in\n      dreams.",
                "She recalled his smothered complaints, his sudden fits of sadness, and the\n      painful mystery of the words which he repeated frequently: \"I can forget\n      you only when I am with you.\" She saw again the Dinard letter and his\n      furious despair at a word overheard at a wine-shop table. She felt that\n      the blow had been struck accidentally at the most sensitive point, at the\n      bleeding wound. But she did not lose courage. She would tell everything,\n      she would confess everything, and all her avowals would say to him: \"I\n      love you. I have never loved any one except you!\" She had not betrayed\n      him. She would tell him nothing that he had not guessed. She had lied so\n      little, as little as possible, and then only not to give him pain. How\n      could he not understand? It was better he should know everything, since\n      everything meant nothing. She represented to herself incessantly the same\n      ideas, repeated to herself the same words.",
                "Her lamp gave only a smoky light. She lighted candles. It was six o'clock.\n      She realized that she had slept. She ran to the window. The sky was black,\n      and mingled with the earth in a chaos of thick darkness. Then she was\n      curious to know exactly at what hour the sun would rise. She had had no\n      idea of this. She thought only that nights were long in December. She did\n      not think of looking at the calendar. The heavy step of workmen walking in\n      squads, the noise of wagons of milkmen and marketmen, came to her ear like\n      sounds of good augury. She shuddered at this first awakening of the city."

Violent and sincere,\n      sure of herself, she explained how she had broken the tie which was\n      already loose and irritated her; how since the day when she had loved him\n      she had been his only, without regret, without a wandering look or\n      thought. But in speaking to him of another she irritated him. And he\n      shouted at her:",

And Jacques shuddered at the phrase which was so familiar, so\n      painful, and was this time so desperate. For a few minutes more she said\n      ardent words and shed tears. Then she left him; she had gained nothing.",
                "At her house she found in the waiting-room the marketwoman, who had come\n      to present a bouquet to her. She remembered that her husband was a State\n      minister. There were telegrams, visiting-cards and letters,\n      congratulations and solicitations. Madame Marmet wrote to recommend her\n      nephew to General Lariviere.",

                "She made no answer. While he was dipping his fingers in the glass bowl, he\n      saw she was so tired that he dared not say any more. He found himself in\n      the presence of a secret which he did not wish to know; in presence of an\n      intimate suffering which one word would reveal. He felt anxiety, fear, and\n      a certain respect.",

A cup of coffee almost\n      empty was on the table. He looked at her with a harshness that chilled\n      her. She dared not talk, feeling that everything that she could say would\n      offend and irritate him, and yet she knew that in remaining discreet and\n      dumb she intensified his anger. He knew that she would return; he had\n      waited for her with impatience. A sudden light came to her, and she saw\n      that she had done wrong to come; that if she had been absent he would have\n      desired, wanted, called for her, perhaps. But it was too late; and, at all\n      events, she was not trying to be crafty.",

                "With ardent patience, at length, she told him her entire life, the little\n      that she had put into it; the sadness of the past; and how, since he had\n      known her, she had lived only through him and in him.",
                "The words fell as limpid as her look. She sat near him. He listened to her\n      with bitter avidity. Cruel with himself, he wished to know everything\n      about her last meetings with the other. She reported faithfully the events\n      of the Great Britain Hotel; but she changed the scene to the outside, in\n      an alley of the Casino, from fear that the image of their sad interview in\n      a closed room should irritate her lover. Then she explained the meeting at\n      the station. She had not wished to cause despair to a suffering man who\n      was so violent. But since then she had had no news from him until the day\n      when he spoke to her on the street. She repeated what she had replied to\n      him. Two days later she had seen him at the opera, in her box. Certainly,\n      she had not encouraged him to come. It was the truth.",
                "It was the truth. But the old poison, slowly accumulating in his mind,\n      burned him. She made the past, the irreparable past, present to him, by\n      her avowals. He saw images of it which tortured him. He said:",
                "\"I do not believe you.\"",
                "And he added:",
                "\"And if I believed you, I could not see you again, because of the idea\n      that you have loved that man. I have told you, I have written to you, you\n      remember, that I did not wish him to be that man. And since -- \"",
                "He stopped.",

His eyes, which she had seen so large, glowing\n      with tenderness, were now dry, harsh, narrowed between wrinkled lids and\n      cast a new glance at her. He frightened her. She went to the rear of the\n      room, sat on a chair, and there she remained, trembling, for a long time,\n      smothered by her sobs. Then she broke into tears.",
                "He sighed:",

                "He stubbornly continued to make her suffer. He felt that he was playing an\n      odious part, but he could not stop.",

                "She wiped her cheeks with her handkerchief; then, lifting her eyes,\n      shining through her tears, she said:",

                "She rose, saw again in the room the thousand things with which she had\n      lived in laughing intimacy, which she had regarded as hers, now suddenly\n      become nothing to her, and confronting her as a stranger and an enemy. She\n      saw again the nude woman who made, while running, the gesture which had\n      not been explained to her; the Florentine models which recalled to her\n      Fiesole and the enchanted hours of Italy; the profile sketch by Dechartre\n      of the girl who laughed in her pretty pathetic thinness. She stopped a\n      moment sympathetically in front of that little newspaper girl who had come\n      there too, and had disappeared, carried away in the irresistible current\n      of life and of events.",
