[HERSELF, dripping wet, comes\n        running along the verandah, through the French window, with a wet Scotch\n        terrier in her arms. She vanishes through the door left. A little pause,\n        and LADY ELLA comes running, dry, thin, refined, and agitated. She halts\n        where the tracks of water cease at the door left. A little pause, and\n        MAUD comes running, fairly dry, stolid, breathless, and dragging a\n        bull-dog, wet, breathless, and stout, by the crutch end of her\n        'en-tout-cas'].",

The furniture and\n        walls give a colour-impression as of greens and beetroot. There is a\n        prevalence of plush. A fireplace on the Left, a sofa, a small table; the\n        curtained window is at the back. On the table, in a common pot, stands a\n        little plant of maidenhair fern, fresh and green. Enter from the door on\n        the Right, a GIRL and a YOUNG OFFICER in khaki. The GIRL wears a\n        discreet dark dress, hat, and veil, and stained yellow gloves. The YOUNG\n        OFFICER is tall, with a fresh open face, and kindly eager blue eyes; he\n        is a little lame. The GIRL, who is evidently at home, moves towards the\n        gas jet to turn it up, then changes her mind, and going to the curtains,\n        draws them apart and throws up the window. Bright moonlight comes\n        flooding in. Outside are seen the trees of a little Square. She stands\n        gazing out, suddenly turns inward with a shiver.",
                "YOUNG OFF. I say; what's the matter? You were crying when I spoke to you.",
                "GIRL. [With a movement of recovery] Oh! nothing. The beautiful\n      evening-that's all.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Looking at her] Cheer up!",
                "GIRL. [Taking of hat and veil; her hair is yellowish and crinkly] Cheer\n      up! You are not lonelee, like me.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Limping to the window -- doubtfully] I say, how did you how\n      did you get into this? Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of life?",
                "GIRL. Yees, it ees. You haf been wounded?",
                "YOUNG OFF. Just out of hospital to-day.",
                "GIRL. The horrible war -- all the misery is because of the war. When\n      will it end?",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Leaning against the window-sill, looking at her attentively] I\n      say, what nationality are you?",
                "GIRL. [With a quick look and away] Rooshian.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Really! I never met a Russian girl. [The GIRL gives him another\n      quick look] I say, is it as bad as they make out?",
                "GIRL. [Slipping her hand through his arm] Not when I haf anyone as ni-ice\n      as you; I never haf had, though. [She smiles, and her smile, like her\n      speech, is slow and confining] You stopped because I was sad, others stop\n      because I am gay. I am not fond of men at all. When you know -- you are\n      not fond of them.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you? You should\n      see them in the trenches. By George! They're simply splendid -- officers\n      and men, every blessed soul. There's never been anything like it -- just\n      one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing.",
                "GIRL. [Turning her blue-grey eyes on him] I expect you are not the last at\n      that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the\n      attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who\n      wasn't an absolute hero. The way they went in -- never thinking of\n      themselves -- it was simply ripping.",

                "GIRL. [Clingingly] But I li-ke you for it. It is so good to find a ni-ice\n      man.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Abruptly] About being lonely? Haven't you any Russian friends?",
                "GIRL. [Blankly] Rooshian? No. [Quickly] The town is so beeg. Were you at\n      the concert before you spoke to me?",

                "GIRL. Well, I haf just one shilling now!",
                "[She laughs bitterly. The laugh upsets him; he sits on the window-sill,\n        and leans forward towards her.]",

                "GIRL. May. Well, I call myself that. It is no good asking yours.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [With a laugh] You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you?",
                "GIRL. I haf reason to be, don't you think?",
                "YOUNG OFF. Yes. I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes.",
                "GIRL. [Sitting on a chair close to the window where the moonlight falls on\n      one powdered cheek] Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time.\n      I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding anybody. I suppose you haf\n      been killing lots of Germans?",
                "YOUNG OFF. We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't\n      come in for that yet.",
                "GIRL. But you would be very glad if you had killed some.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Oh, glad? I don't think so. We're all in the same boat, so far\n      as that's concerned. We're not glad to kill each other -- not most of\n      us. We do our job -- that's all.",
                "GIRL. Oh! It is frightful. I expect I haf my brothers killed.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Don't you get any news ever?",
                "GIRL. News? No indeed, no news of anybody in my country. I might not haf a\n      country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder, sisters, broders,\n      all; never any more I shall see them, I suppose, now. The war it breaks\n      and breaks, it breaks hearts. [She gives a little snarl] Do you know what\n      I was thinking when you came up to me? I was thinking of my native town,\n      and the river in the moonlight. If I could see it again I would be glad.\n      Were you ever homeseeck?",
                "YOUNG OFF. Yes, I have been -- in the trenches. But one's ashamed with\n      all the others.",
                "GIRL. Ah! Yees! Yees! You are all comrades there. What is it like for me\n      here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises me, and would catch\n      me and put me in prison, perhaps. [Her breast heaves.]",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Leaning forward and patting her knee] Sorry -- sorry.",
                "GIRL. [In a smothered voice] You are the first who has been kind to me for\n      so long! I will tell you the truth -- I am not Rooshian at all  -- I\n      am German.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Staring] My dear girl, who cares. We aren't fighting against\n      women.",
                "GIRL. [Peering at him] Another man said that to me. But he was thinkin' of\n      his fun. You are a veree ni-ice boy; I am so glad I met you. You see the\n      good in people, don't you? That is the first thing in the world -- because -- there\n      is really not much good in people, you know.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Smiling] You are a dreadful little cynic! But of course you\n      are!",
                "GIRL. Cyneec? How long do you think I would live if I was not a cyneec? I\n      should drown myself to-morrow. Perhaps there are good people, but, you\n      see, I don't know them.",
                "YOUNG OFF. I know lots.",
                "GIRL. [Leaning towards him] Well now -- see, ni-ice boy -- you haf\n      never been in a hole, haf you?",
                "YOUNG OFF. I suppose not a real hole.",
                "GIRL. No, I should think not, with your face. Well, suppose I am still a\n      good girl, as I was once, you know; and you took me to your mother and\n      your sisters and you said: \"Here is a little German girl that has no work,\n      and no money, and no friends.\" They will say: \"Oh! how sad! A German\n      girl!\" And they will go and wash their hands.",
                "[The OFFICER, is silent, staring at her.]",
                "GIRL. You see.",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Muttering] I'm sure there are people.",
                "GIRL. No. They would not take a German, even if she was good. Besides, I\n      don't want to be good any more -- I am not a humbug; I have learned to\n      be bad. Aren't you going to kees me, ni-ice boy?",
                "She puts her face close to his. Her eyes trouble him; he draws back.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Don't. I'd rather not, if you don't mind. [She looks at him\n      fixedly, with a curious inquiring stare] It's stupid. I don't know -- but\n      you see, out there, and in hospital, life's different. It's -- it's -- it\n      isn't mean, you know. Don't come too close.",
                "GIRL. Oh! You are fun --  -- [She stops] Doesn't it light. No Zeps\n      to-night. When they burn -- what a 'orrble death! And all the people\n      cheer. It is natural. Do you hate us veree much?",
                "YOUNG OFF. [Turning sharply] Hate? I don't know.",
                "GIRL. I don't hate even the English -- I despise them. I despise my\n      people too; even more, because they began this war. Oh! I know that. I\n      despise all the peoples. Why haf they made the world so miserable  -- why\n      haf they killed all our lives -- hundreds and thousands and millions of\n      lives -- all for noting? They haf made a bad world --  everybody\n      hating, and looking for the worst everywhere. They haf made me bad, I\n      know. I believe no more in anything. What is there to believe in? Is there\n      a God? No! Once I was teaching little English children their prayers -- isn't\n      that funnee? I was reading to them about Christ and love. I believed all\n      those things. Now I believe noting at all -- no one who is not a fool\n      or a liar can believe. I would like to work in a 'ospital; I would like to\n      go and 'elp poor boys like you. Because I am a German they would throw me\n      out a 'undred times, even if I was good. It is the same in Germany, in\n      France, in Russia, everywhere. But do you think I will believe in Love and\n      Christ and God and all that -- Not I! I think we are animals  -- that's\n      all! Oh, yes! you fancy it is because my life has spoiled me. It is not\n      that at all -- that is not the worst thing in life. The men I take are\n      not ni-ice, like you, but it's their nature; and -- they help me to\n      live, which is something for me, anyway. No, it is the men who think\n      themselves great and good and make the war with their talk and their hate,\n      killing us all -- killing all the boys like you, and keeping poor\n      People in prison, and telling us to go on hating; and all these dreadful\n      cold-blood creatures who write in the papers  -- the same in my country -- just\n      the same; it is because of all of them that I think we are only animals.",
                "[The YOUNG OFFICER gets up, acutely miserable.] [She follows him with\n        her eyes.]",
                "GIRL. Don't mind me talkin', ni-ice boy. I don't know anyone to talk to.\n      If you don't like it, I can be quiet as a mouse.",
                "YOUNG OFF. Oh, go on! Talk away; I'm not obliged to believe you, and I\n      don't.",
                "[She, too, is on her feet now, leaning against the wall; her dark dress\n        and white face just touched by the slanting moonlight. Her voice comes\n        again, slow and soft and bitter.]",
                "GIRL. Well, look here, ni-ice boy, what sort of world is it, where\n      millions are being tortured, for no fault of theirs, at all? A beautiful\n      world, isn't it? 'Umbog! Silly rot, as you boys call it. You say it is all\n      \"Comrades\" and braveness out there at the front, and people don't think of\n      themselves. Well, I don't think of myself veree much. What does it matter?\n      I am lost now, anyway. But I think of my people at 'ome; how they suffer\n      and grieve. I think of all the poor people there, and here, how lose those\n      they love, and all the poor prisoners. Am I not to think of them? And if I\n      do, how am I to believe it a beautiful world, ni-ice boy?",

Official! British! 'Eavy defeat of the 'Uns! Many thousand\n        prisoners!

Hardly a moment he\n        stays, then makes for the door. When he is gone, she still stands there,\n        her chin on her breast, with the sound in her ears of cheering, of\n        hurrying feet, and voices crying: \"'Eavy Defeat!\" stands, in the centre\n        of a pattern made by the fragments of the torn-up notes, staring out\n        unto the moonlight, seeing not this hated room and the hated Square\n        outside, but a German orchard, and herself, a little girl, plucking\n        apples, a big dog beside her; and a hundred other pictures, such as the\n        drowning see. Then she sinks down on the floor, lays her forehead on the\n        dusty carpet, and presses her body to it. Mechanically, she sweeps\n        together the scattered fragments of notes, assembling them with the dust\n        into a little pile, as of fallen leaves, and dabbling in it with her\n        fingers, while the tears run down her cheeks.",

Stage Right of the French windows is a large armchair turned\n        rather towards the window, with a book rest attached, on which is a\n        volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica, while on a stool alongside are\n        writing materials such as a man requires when he writes with a pad on\n        his knees. On a little table close by is a reading-lamp with a dark\n        green shade. A crude light from the floats makes the stage stare; the\n        only person on it is MR FORESON, the stage manager, who is standing in\n        the centre looking upwards as if waiting for someone to speak. He is a\n        short, broad man, rather blank, and fatal. From the back of the\n        auditorium, or from an empty box, whichever is most convenient, the\n        producer, MR BLEWITT VANE, a man of about thirty four, with his hair\n        brushed back, speaks.",
