                "\"What do you think she'd do if she caught us? We oughtn't to\nhave it, you know,\" said Maisie.",
                "\"Beat me, and lock you up in your bedroom,\" Dick answered, without\nhesitation. \"Have you got the cartridges?\"",
                "\"Yes; they're in my pocket, but they are joggling horribly. Do\npin-fire cartridges go off of their own accord?\"",
                "\"Don't know. Take the revolver, if you are afraid, and let me carry\nthem.\"",
                "\"I'm not afraid.\" Maisie strode forward swiftly, a\nhand in her pocket and her chin in the air. Dick followed with a small pin-fire\nrevolver.",
                "The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without\npistol-practice. After much forethought and self-denial, Dick had saved seven\nshillings and sixpence, the price of a badly constructed Belgian revolver.\nMaisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for the purchase of\na hundred cartridges. \"You can save better than I can, Dick,\" she\nexplained; \"I like nice things to eat, and it doesn't matter to\nyou. Besides, boys ought to do these things.\"",
                "Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement, but went out and made the purchase,\nwhich the children were then on their way to test. Revolvers did not lie in the\nscheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the guardian who was\nincorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to these two orphans.\nDick had been under her care for six years, during which time she had made her\nprofit of the allowances supposed to be expended on his clothes, and, partly\nthrough thoughtlessness, partly through a natural desire to pain, -- she was\na widow of some years anxious to marry again, -- had made his days\nburdensome on his young shoulders.",
                "Where he had looked for love, she gave him first aversion and then hate.",
                "Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy, she gave him ridicule. The\nmany hours that she could spare from the ordering of her small house she\ndevoted to what she called the home-training of Dick Heldar. Her religion,\nmanufactured in the main by her own intelligence and a keen study of the\nScriptures, was an aid to her in this matter. At such times as she herself was\nnot personally displeased with Dick, she left him to understand that he had a\nheavy account to settle with his Creator; wherefore Dick learned to loathe his\nGod as intensely as he loathed Mrs. Jennett; and this is not a wholesome frame\nof mind for the young. Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar, when\ndread of pain drove him to his first untruth, he naturally developed into a\nliar, but an economical and self-contained one, never throwing away the least\nunnecessary fib, and never hesitating at the blackest, were it only plausible,\nthat might make his life a little easier. The treatment taught him at least the\npower of living alone, -- a power that was of service to him when he went to\na public school and the boys laughed at his clothes, which were poor in quality\nand much mended. In the holidays he returned to the teachings of Mrs. Jennett,\nand, that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the\nworld, was generally beaten, on one account or another, before he had been\ntwelve hours under her roof.",
                "The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage, a long-haired,\ngray-eyed little atom, as self-contained as himself, who moved about the house\nsilently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was her\nchiefest friend on earth and lived in the back-garden. Mrs. Jennett objected to\nthe goat on the grounds that he was un-Christian, -- which he certainly was.\n\"Then,\" said the atom, choosing her words very deliberately,\n\"I shall write to my lawyer-peoples and tell them that you are a very bad\nwoman. Amomma is mine, mine, mine!\" Mrs. Jennett made a movement to the\nhall, where certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack. The atom understood as\nclearly as Dick what this meant. \"I have been beaten before,\" she\nsaid, still in the same passionless voice; \"I have been beaten worse than\nyou can ever beat me. If you beat me I shall write to my lawyer-peoples and\ntell them that you do not give me enough to eat. I am not afraid of you.\"\nMrs. Jennett did not go into the hall, and the atom, after a pause to assure\nherself that all danger of war was past, went out, to weep bitterly on\nAmomma's neck.",
                "Dick learned to know her as Maisie, and at first mistrusted her profoundly, for\nhe feared that she might interfere with the small liberty of action left to\nhim. She did not, however; and she volunteered no friendliness until Dick had\ntaken the first steps. Long before the holidays were over, the stress of\npunishment shared in common drove the children together, if it were only to\nplay into each other's hands as they prepared lies for Mrs.\nJennett's use. When Dick returned to school, Maisie whispered, \"Now\nI shall be all alone to take care of myself; but,\" and she nodded her\nhead bravely, \"I can do it. You promised to send Amomma a grass collar.\nSend it soon.\" A week later she asked for that collar by return of post,\nand was not pleased when she learned that it took time to make. When at last\nDick forwarded the gift, she forgot to thank him for it.",
                "Many holidays had come and gone since that day, and Dick had grown into a lanky\nhobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes. Not for a moment had\nMrs. Jennett relaxed her tender care of him, but the average canings of a\npublic school -- Dick fell under punishment about three times a\nmonth -- filled him with contempt for her powers. \"She doesn't\nhurt,\" he explained to Maisie, who urged him to rebellion, \"and she\nis kinder to you after she has whacked me.\" Dick shambled through the\ndays unkempt in body and savage in soul, as the smaller boys of the school\nlearned to know, for when the spirit moved him he would hit them, cunningly and\nwith science. The same spirit made him more than once try to tease Maisie, but\nthe girl refused to be made unhappy. \"We are both miserable as it\nis,\" said she. \"What is the use of trying to make things worse?\nLet's find things to do, and forget things.\"",
                "The pistol was the outcome of that search. It could only be used on the\nmuddiest foreshore of the beach, far away from the bathing-machines and\npierheads, below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out nearly two\nmiles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks, touched by the sun, sent\nup a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was late in the afternoon when Dick and\nMaisie arrived on their ground, Amomma trotting patiently behind them.",
                "\"Mf!\" said Maisie, sniffing the air. \"I wonder what makes the\nsea so smelly? I don't like it!\"",
                "\"You never like anything that isn't made just for you,\" said\nDick bluntly. \"Give me the cartridges, and I'll try first shot. How\nfar does one of these little revolvers carry?\"",
                "\"Oh, half a mile,\" said Maisie, promptly. \"At least it makes\nan awful noise. Be careful with the cartridges; I don't like those jagged\nstick-up things on the rim. Dick, do be careful.\"",
                "\"All right. I know how to load. I'll fire at the breakwater out\nthere.\"",
                "He fired, and Amomma ran away bleating. The bullet threw up a spurt of mud to\nthe right of the wood-wreathed piles.",
                "\"Throws high and to the right. You try, Maisie. Mind, it's loaded\nall round.\"",
                "Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud, her hand\nfirmly closed on the butt, her mouth and left eye screwed up.",
                "Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma returned very cautiously.\nHe was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks, and, finding\nthe cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations with his nose. Maisie fired,\nbut could not see where the bullet went.",
                "\"I think it hit the post,\" she said, shading her eyes and looking\nout across the sailless sea.",
                "\"I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell-buoy,\" said Dick, with\na chuckle. \"Fire low and to the left; then perhaps you'll get it.\nOh, look at Amomma! -- he's eating the cartridges!\"",
                "Maisie turned, the revolver in her hand, just in time to see Amomma scampering\naway from the pebbles Dick threw after him. Nothing is sacred to a billy-goat.\nBeing well fed and the adored of his mistress, Amomma had naturally swallowed\ntwo loaded pin-fire cartridges. Maisie hurried up to assure herself that Dick\nhad not miscounted the tale.",
                "\"Yes, he's eaten two.\"",
                "\"Horrid little beast! Then they'll joggle about inside him and blow\nup, and serve him right.... Oh, Dick! have I killed you?\"",
                "Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with. Maisie could not\nexplain how it had happened, but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from\nDick, and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face. Then\nshe heard him sputter, and dropped on her knees beside him, crying,\n\"Dick, you aren't hurt, are you? I didn't mean it.\"",
                "\"Of course you didn't, said Dick, coming out of the smoke and\nwiping his cheek. \"But you nearly blinded me. That powder stuff stings\nawfully.\" A neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the\nbullet had gone. Maisie began to whimper.",
                "\"Don't,\" said Dick, jumping to his feet and shaking himself.\n\"I'm not a bit hurt.\"",
                "\"No, but I might have killed you,\" protested Maisie, the corners of\nher mouth drooping. \"What should I have done then?\"",
                "\"Gone home and told Mrs. Jennett.\" Dick grinned at the thought;\nthen, softening, \"Please don't worry about it. Besides, we are\nwasting time.",
                "We've got to get back to tea. I'll take the revolver for a\nbit.\"",
                "Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's\nindifference, albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol,\nrestrained her. She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically bombarded\nthe breakwater. \"Got it at last!\" he exclaimed, as a lock of weed\nflew from the wood.",
                "\"Let me try,\" said Maisie, imperiously. \"I'm all right\nnow.\"",
                "They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself to\npieces, and Amomma the outcast -- because he might blow up at any\nmoment -- browsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown at\nhim. Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which was commanded by\nthe seaward slope of Fort Keeling, and they sat down together before this new\ntarget.",
                "\"Next holidays,\" said Dick, as the now thoroughly fouled revolver\nkicked wildly in his hand, \"we'll get another pistol, -- central\nfire, -- that will carry farther.\"",
                "\"There won't b any next holidays for me,\" said Maisie.\n\"I'm going away.\"",
                "\"Where to?\"",
                "\"I don't know. My lawyers have written to Mrs. Jennett, and\nI've got to be educated somewhere, -- in France, perhaps, -- I\ndon't know where; but I shall be glad to go away.\"",
                "\"I shan't like it a bit. I suppose I shall be left. Look here,\nMaisie, is it really true you're going? Then these holidays will be the\nlast I shall see anything of you; and I go back to school next week. I\nwish --  -- \"",
                "The young blood turned his cheeks scarlet. Maisie was picking grass-tufts and\nthrowing them down the slope at a yellow sea-poppy nodding all by itself to the\nillimitable levels of the mud-flats and the milk-white sea beyond.",
                "\"I wish,\" she said, after a pause, \"that I could see you\nagain sometime.",
                "You wish that, too?\"",
                "\"Yes, but it would have been better if -- if -- you had -- shot\nstraight over there -- down by the breakwater.\"",
                "Maisie looked with large eyes for a moment. And this was the boy who only ten\ndays before had decorated Amomma's horns with cut-paper ham-frills and\nturned him out, a bearded derision, among the public ways! Then she dropped her\neyes: this was not the boy.",
                "\"Don't be stupid,\" she said reprovingly, and with swift\ninstinct attacked the side-issue. \"How selfish you are! Just think what I\nshould have felt if that horrid thing had killed you! I'm quite miserable\nenough already.\"",
                "\"Why? Because you're going away from Mrs. Jennett?\"",
                "\"No.\"",
                "\"From me, then?\"",
                "No answer for a long time. Dick dared not look at her. He felt, though he did\nnot know, all that the past four years had been to him, and this the more\nacutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words.",
                "\"I don't know,\" she said. \"I suppose it is.\"",
                "\"Maisie, you must know. I'm not supposing.\"",
                "\"Let's go home,\" said Maisie, weakly.",
                "But Dick was not minded to retreat.",
                "\"I can't say things,\" he pleaded, \"and I'm\nawfully sorry for teasing you about Amomma the other day. It's all\ndifferent now, Maisie, can't you see? And you might have told me that you\nwere going, instead of leaving me to find out.\"",
                "\"You didn't. I did tell. Oh, Dick, what's the use of\nworrying?\"",
                "\"There isn't any; but we've been together years and years,\nand I didn't know how much I cared.\"",
                "\"I don't believe you ever did care.\"",
                "\"No, I didn't; but I do, -- I care awfully now, Maisie,\"\nhe gulped, -- \"Maisie, darling, say you care too, please.\"",
                "\"I do, indeed I do; but it won't be any use.\"",
                "\"Why?\"",
                "\"Because I am going away.\"",
                "\"Yes, but if you promise before you go. Only say -- will you?\" A\nsecond \"darling' came to his lips more easily than the first. There\nwere few endearments in Dick's home or school life; he had to find them\nby instinct. Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of the\nrevolver.",
                "\"I promise,\" she said solemnly; \"but if I care there is no\nneed for promising.\"",
                "\"And do you care?\" For the first time in the past few minutes their\neyes met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech....",
                "\"Oh, Dick, don't! Please don't! It was all right when we said\ngood-morning; but now it's all different!\" Amomma looked on from\nafar.",
                "He had seen his property quarrel frequently, but he had never seen kisses\nexchanged before. The yellow sea-poppy was wiser, and nodded its head\napprovingly. Considered as a kiss, that was a failure, but since it was the\nfirst, other than those demanded by duty, in all the world that either had ever\ngiven or taken, it opened to them new worlds, and every one of them glorious,\nso that they were lifted above the consideration of any worlds at all,\nespecially those in which tea is necessary, and sat still, holding each\nother's hands and saying not a word.",
                "\"You can't forget now,\" said Dick, at last. There was that on\nhis cheek that stung more than gunpowder.",
                "\"I shouldn't have forgotten anyhow,\" said Maisie, and they\nlooked at each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an\nhour ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand. The sun began to\nset, and a night-wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore.",
                "\"We shall be awfully late for tea,\" said Maisie. \"Let's\ngo home.\"",
                "\"Let's use the rest of the cartridges first,\" said Dick; and\nhe helped Maisie down the slope of the fort to the sea, -- a descent that\nshe was quite capable of covering at full speed. Equally gravely Maisie took\nthe grimy hand. Dick bent forward clumsily; Maisie drew the hand away, and Dick\nblushed.",
                "\"It's very pretty,\" he said.",
                "\"Pooh!\" said Maisie, with a little laugh of gratified vanity. She\nstood close to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over\nthe sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting\nMaisie from all the evils in the world. A puddle far across the mud caught the\nlast rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red disc. The light held\nDick's attention for a moment, and as he raised his revolver there fell\nupon him a renewed sense of the miraculous, in that he was standing by Maisie\nwho had promised to care for him for an indefinite length of time till such\ndate as --  --  A gust of the growing wind drove the girl's long\nblack hair across his face as she stood with her hand on his shoulder calling\nAmomma \"a little beast,\" and for a moment he was in the\ndark, -- a darkness that stung. The bullet went singing out to the empty\nsea.",
                "\"Spoilt my aim,\" said he, shaking his head. \"There\naren't any more cartridges; we shall have to run home.\" But they\ndid not run. They walked very slowly, arm in arm. And it was a matter of\nindifference to them whether the neglected Amomma with two pin-fire cartridges\nin his inside blew up or trotted beside them; for they had come into a golden\nheritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their years.",
                "\"And I shall be --  -- \" quoth Dick, valiantly. Then he\nchecked himself: \"I don't know what I shall be. I don't seem\nto be able to pass any exams, but I can make awful caricatures of the masters.\nHo! Ho!\"",
                "\"Be an artist, then,\" said Maisie. \"You're always\nlaughing at my trying to draw; and it will do you good.\"",
                "\"I'll never laugh at anything you do,\" he answered.\n\"I'll be an artist, and I'll do things.\"",
                "\"Artists always want money, don't they?\"",
                "\"I've got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own. My\nguardians tell me I'm to have it when I come of age. That will be enough\nto begin with.\"",
                "\"Ah, I'm rich,\" said Maisie. \"I've got three\nhundred a year all my own when I'm twenty-one. That's why Mrs.\nJennett is kinder to me than she is to you. I wish, though, that I had somebody\nthat belonged to me, -- just a father or a mother.\"",
                "\"You belong to me,\" said Dick, \"for ever and ever.\"",
                "\"Yes, we belong -- for ever. It's very nice.\" She squeezed\nhis arm. The kindly darkness hid them both, and, emboldened because he could\nonly just see the profile of Maisie's cheek with the long lashes veiling\nthe gray eyes, Dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had\nbeen boggling over for the last two hours.",
                "\"And I -- love you, Maisie,\" he said, in a whisper that seemed\nto him to ring across the world, -- the world that he would to-morrow or the\nnext day set out to conquer.",
                "There was a scene, not, for the sake of discipline, to be reported, when Mrs.\nJennett would have fallen upon him, first for disgraceful unpunctuality, and\nsecondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden weapon.",
                "\"I was playing with it, and it went off by itself,\" said Dick, when\nthe powder-pocked cheek could no longer be hidden, \"but if you think\nyou're going to lick me you're wrong. You are never going to touch\nme again.",
                "Sit down and give me my tea. You can't cheat us out of that,\nanyhow.\"",
                "Mrs. Jennett gasped and became livid. Maisie said nothing, but encouraged Dick\nwith her eyes, and he behaved abominably all that evening. Mrs. Jennett\nprophesied an immediate judgment of Providence and a descent into Tophet later,\nbut Dick walked in Paradise and would not hear. Only when he was going to bed\nMrs. Jennett recovered and asserted herself. He had bidden Maisie good-night\nwith down-dropped eyes and from a distance.",
                "\"If you aren't a gentleman you might try to behave like one,\"\nsaid Mrs.",
                "Jennett, spitefully. \"You've been quarrelling with Maisie\nagain.\"",
                "This meant that the usual good-night kiss had been omitted. Maisie, white to\nthe lips, thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of indifference, and was\nduly pecked by Dick, who tramped out of the room red as fire. That night he\ndreamed a wild dream. He had won all the world and brought it to Maisie in a\ncartridge-box, but she turned it over with her foot, and, instead of saying\n\"Thank you,\" cried -- \"Where is the grass collar you\npromised for Amomma? Oh, how selfish you are!\"",

A heap of\nboat-rollers, commissariat-boxes, sugar-bags, and flour- and\nsmall-arm-ammunition-cases showed where one of the whale-boats had been\ncompelled to unload hastily; and a regimental carpenter was swearing aloud as\nhe tried, on a wholly insufficient allowance of white lead, to plaster up the\nsun-parched gaping seams of the boat herself.",

                "There was no answer, save the incessant angry murmur of the Nile as it raced\nround a basalt-walled bend and foamed across a rock-ridge half a mile upstream.\nIt was as though the brown weight of the river would drive the white men back\nto their own country. The indescribable scent of Nile mud in the air told that\nthe stream was falling and the next few miles would be no light thing for the\nwhale-boats to overpass. The desert ran down almost to the banks, where, among\ngray, red, and black hillocks, a camel-corps was encamped. No man dared even\nfor a day lose touch of the slow-moving boats; there had been no fighting for\nweeks past, and throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them. Rapid\nhad followed rapid, rock rock, and island-group island-group, till the rank and\nfile had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of time. They\nwere moving somewhere, they did not know why, to do something, they did not\nknow what. Before them lay the Nile, and at the other end of it was one Gordon,\nfighting for the dear life, in a town called Khartoum. There were columns of\nBritish troops in the desert, or in one of the many deserts; there were yet\nmore columns waiting to embark on the river; there were fresh drafts waiting at\nAssioot and Assuan; there were lies and rumours running over the face of the\nhopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract, and men supposed generally\nthat there must be some one in authority to direct the general scheme of the\nmany movements. The duty of that particular river-column was to keep the\nwhale-boats afloat in the water, to avoid trampling on the villagers'\ncrops when the gangs \"tracked' the boats with lines thrown from\nmidstream, to get as much sleep and food as was possible, and, above all, to\npress on without delay in the teeth of the churning Nile.",
                "With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers, and\nthey were almost as ignorant as their companions. But it was above all things\nnecessary that England at breakfast should be amused and thrilled and\ninterested, whether Gordon lived or died, or half the British army went to\npieces in the sands. The Soudan campaign was a picturesque one, and lent itself\nto vivid word-painting. Now and again a \"Special' managed to get\nslain, -- which was not altogether a disadvantage to the paper that employed\nhim, -- and more often the hand-to-hand nature of the fighting allowed of\nmiraculous escapes which were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the\nword. There were many correspondents with many corps and columns, -- from\nthe veterans who had followed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied Cairo\nin '82, what time Arabi Pasha called himself king, who had seen the first\nmiserable work round Suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub\nswarmed with spears, to youngsters jerked into the business at the end of a\ntelegraph-wire to take the places of their betters killed or invalided.",
                "Among the seniors -- those who knew every shift and change in the perplexing\npostal arrangements, the value of the seediest, weediest Egyptian garron\noffered for sale in Cairo or Alexandria, who could talk a telegraph-clerk into\namiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a newly appointed staff-officer\nwhen press regulations became burdensome -- was the man in the flannel\nshirt, the black-browed Torpenhow. He represented the Central Southern\nSyndicate in the campaign, as he had represented it in the Egyptian war, and\nelsewhere. The syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of\nattack and the like. It supplied the masses, and all it demanded was\npicturesqueness and abundance of detail; for there is more joy in England over\na soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to rescue a comrade than over\ntwenty generals slaving even to baldness at the gross details of transport and\ncommissariat.",
                "He had met at Suakin a young man, sitting on the edge of a recently abandoned\nredoubt about the size of a hat-box, sketching a clump of shell-torn bodies on\nthe gravel plain.",
                "\"What are you for?\" said Torpenhow. The greeting of the\ncorrespondent is that of the commercial traveller on the road.",
                "\"My own hand,\" said the young man, without looking up. \"Have\nyou any tobacco?\"",
                "Torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished, and when he had looked at it\nsaid, \"What's your business here?\"",
                "\"Nothing; there was a row, so I came. I'm supposed to be doing\nsomething down at the painting-slips among the boats, or else I'm in\ncharge of the condenser on one of the water-ships. I've forgotten\nwhich.\"",
                "\"You've cheek enough to build a redoubt with,\" said\nTorpenhow, and took stock of the new acquaintance. \"Do you always draw\nlike that?\"",
                "The young man produced more sketches. \"Row on a Chinese pig-boat,\"\nsaid he, sententiously, showing them one after another. -- \"Chief mate\ndirked by a comprador. -- Junk ashore off Hakodate. -- Somali muleteer\nbeing flogged. -- Star-shelled bursting over camp at\nBerbera. -- Slave-dhow being chased round Tajurrah Bah. -- Soldier lying\ndead in the moonlight outside Suakin. -- throat cut by Fuzzies.\"",
                "\"H'm!\" said Torpenhow, \"can't say I care for\nVerestchagin-and-water myself, but there's no accounting for tastes.\nDoing anything now, are you?\"",
                "\"No. I'm amusing myself here.\"",
                "Torpenhow looked at the aching desolation of the place. \"Faith,\nyou've queer notions of amusement. Got any money?\"",
                "\"Enough to go on with. Look here: do you want me to do war-work?\"",
                "\"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. My syndicate may, though. You can draw more than a\nlittle, and I don't suppose you care much what you get, do you?\"",
                "\"Not this time. I want my chance first.\"",
                "Torpenhow looked at the sketches again, and nodded. \"Yes, you're\nright to take your first chance when you can get it.\"",
                "He rode away swiftly through the Gate of the Two War-Ships, rattled across the\ncauseway into the town, and wired to his syndicate, \"Got man here,\npicture-work. Good and cheap. Shall I arrange? Will do letterpress with\nsketches.\"",
                "The man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring, \"I knew the\nchance would come, sooner or later. By Gad, they'll have to sweat for it\nif I come through this business alive!\"",
                "In the evening Torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the Central\nSouthern Agency was willing to take him on trial, paying expenses for three\nmonths. \"And, by the way, what's your name?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Heldar. Do they give me a free hand?\"",
                "\"They've taken you on chance. You must justify the choice.\nYou'd better stick to me. I'm going up-country with a column, and\nI'll do what I can for you. Give me some of your sketches taken here, and\nI'll send 'em along.\" To himself he said, \"That's\nthe best bargain the Central southern has ever made; and they got me cheaply\nenough.\"",
                "So it came to pass that, after some purchase of horse-flesh and arrangements\nfinancial and political, Dick was made free of the New and Honourable\nFraternity of war correspondents, who all possess the inalienable right of\ndoing as much work as they can and getting as much for it as Providence and\ntheir owners shall please. To these things are added in time, if the brother be\nworthy, the power of glib speech that neither man nor woman can resist when a\nmeal or a bed is in question, the eye of a horse-cope, the skill of a cook, the\nconstitution of a bullock, the digestion of an ostrich, and an infinite\nadaptability to all circumstances. But many die before they attain to this\ndegree, and the past-masters in the craft appear for the most part in\ndress-clothes when they are in England, and thus their glory is hidden from the\nmultitude.",
                "Dick followed Torpenhow wherever the latter's fancy chose to lead him,\nand between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost satisfied\nthemselves. It was not an easy life in any way, and under its influence the two\nwere drawn very closely together, for they ate from the same dish, they shared\nthe same water-bottle, and, most binding tie of all, their mails went off\ntogether. It was Dick who managed to make gloriously drunk a telegraph-clerk in\na palm hut far beyond the Second Cataract, and, while the man lay in bliss on\nthe floor, possessed himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive\ninformation, forwarded by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate,\nmade a careful duplicate of the matter, and brought the result to Torpenhow,\nwho said that all was fair in love or war correspondence, and built an\nexcellent descriptive article from his rival's riotous waste of words. It\nwas Torpenhow who -- but the tale of their adventures, together and apart,\nfrom Philae to the waste wilderness of Herawi and Muella, would fill many\nbooks. They had been penned into a square side by side, in deadly fear of being\nshot by over-excited soldiers; they had fought with baggage-camels in the chill\ndawn; they had jogged along in silence under blinding sun on indefatigable\nlittle Egyptian horses; and they had floundered on the shallows of the Nile\nwhen the whale-boat in which they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock\nand rip out half her bottom-planks.",
                "Now they were sitting on the sand-bank, and the whale-boats were bringing up\nthe remainder of the column.",
                "\"Yes,\" said Torpenhow, as he put the last rude stitches into his\nover-long-neglected gear, \"it has been a beautiful business.\"",
                "\"The patch or the campaign?\" said Dick. \"Don't think\nmuch of either, myself.\"",
                "\"You want the Euryalus brought up above the Third Cataract,\ndon't you? and eighty-one-ton guns at Jakdul? Now, I'm quite\nsatisfied with my breeches.\" He turned round gravely to exhibit himself,\nafter the manner of a clown.",
                "\"It's very pretty. Specially the lettering on the sack. G.B.T.\nGovernment Bullock Train. That's a sack from India.\"",
                "\"It's my initials, -- Gilbert Belling Torpenhow. I stole the\ncloth on purpose.",
                "What the mischief are the camel-corps doing yonder?\" Torpenhow shaded his\neyes and looked across the scrub-strewn gravel.",
                "A bugle blew furiously, and the men on the bank hurried to their arms and\naccoutrements.",
                "\"\"Pisan soldiery surprised while bathing,\"' remarked\nDick, calmly.",
                "\"D'you remember the picture? It's by Michael Angelo; all\nbeginners copy it. That scrub's alive with enemy.\"",
                "The camel-corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them, and a\nhoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind\nof the trouble and was hastening to take share in it. As swiftly as a reach of\nstill water is crisped by the wind, the rock-strewn ridges and scrub-topped\nhills were troubled and alive with armed men.",
                "Mercifully, it occurred to these to stand far off for a time, to shout and\ngesticulate joyously. One man even delivered himself of a long story. The\ncamel-corps did not fire. They were only too glad of a little breathing-space,\nuntil some sort of square could be formed. The men on the sand-bank ran to\ntheir side; and the whale-boats, as they toiled up within shouting distance,\nwere thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all save the sick and a few\nmen to guard them. The Arab orator ceased his outcries, and his friends howled.",
                "\"They look like the Mahdi's men,\" said Torpenhow, elbowing\nhimself into the crush of the square; \"but what thousands of 'em\nthere are! The tribes hereabout aren't against us, I know.\"",
                "\"Then the Mahdi's taken another town,\" said Dick, \"and\nset all these yelping devils free to show us up. Lend us your glass.\"",
                "\"Our scouts should have told us of this. We've been trapped,\"\nsaid a subaltern. \"Aren't the camel guns ever going to begin? Hurry\nup, you men!\"",
                "There was no need of any order. The men flung themselves panting against the\nsides of the square, for they had good reason to know that whoso was left\noutside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely\nunpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound camel-guns posted at one\ncorner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right\nto get possession of a knoll of rising ground. All had fought in this manner\nmany times before, and there was no novelty in the entertainment; always the\nsame hot and stifling formation, the smell of dust and leather, the same\nboltlike rush of the enemy, the same pressure on the weakest side, the few\nminutes of hand-to-hand scuffle, and then the silence of the desert, broken\nonly by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to pursue.\nThey had become careless. The camel-guns spoke at intervals, and the square\nslouched forward amid the protesting of the camels. Then came the attack of\nthree thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for\ntroops in close order to attack against breech-loading fire.",
                "A few dropping shots heralded their approach, and a few horsemen led, but the\nbulk of the force was naked humanity, mad with rage, and armed with the spear\nand the sword. The instinct of the desert, where there is always much war, told\nthem that the right flank of the square was the weakest, for they swung clear\nof the front. The camel-guns shelled them as they passed and opened for an\ninstant lanes through their midst, most like those quick-closing vistas in a\nKentish hop-garden seen when the train races by at full speed; and the infantry\nfire, held till the opportune moment, dropped them in close-packing hundreds.\nNo civilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they\ncame, the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels,\nthe wounded cursing and staggering forward, till they fell -- a torrent\nblack as the sliding water above a mill-dam -- full on the right flank of\nthe square.",
                "Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead went\nout in rolling smoke, and the little stones on the heated ground and the\ntinder-dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest, for men\nmeasured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things, counting\nmechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch. There was\nno semblance of any concerted fighting. For aught the men knew, the enemy might\nbe attempting all four sides of the square at once. Their business was to\ndestroy what lay in front of them, to bayonet in the back those who passed over\nthem, and, dying, to drag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head\nby some avenging gun-butt.",
                "Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew unendurable.\nIt was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was repulsed, so the\nthree moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of the square. There was\na rush from without, the short hough-hough of the stabbing spears, and a\nman on a horse, followed by thirty or forty others, dashed through, yelling and\nhacking. The right flank of the square sucked in after them, and the other\nsides sent help. The wounded, who knew that they had but a few hours more to\nlive, caught at the enemy's feet and brought them down, or, staggering\ninto a discarded rifle, fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre\nof the square.",
                "Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet, that\nhe had fired his revolver into a black, foam-flecked face which forthwith\nceased to bear any resemblance to a face, and that Torpenhow had gone down\nunder an Arab whom he had tried to \"collar low,\" and was turning\nover and over with his captive, feeling for the man's eyes. The doctor\njabbed at a venture with a bayonet, and a helmetless soldier fired over\nDick's shoulder: the flying grains of powder stung his cheek. It was to\nTorpenhow that Dick turned by instinct. The representative of the Central\nSouthern Syndicate had shaken himself clear of his enemy, and rose, wiping his\nthumb on his trousers. The Arab, both hands to his forehead, screamed aloud,\nthen snatched up his spear and rushed at Torpenhow, who was panting under\nshelter of Dick's revolver. Dick fired twice, and the man dropped limply.\nHis upturned face lacked one eye. The musketry-fire redoubled, but cheers\nmingled with it. The rush had failed and the enemy were flying. If the heart of\nthe square were shambles, the ground beyond was a butcher's shop. Dick\nthrust his way forward between the maddened men. The remnant of the enemy were\nretiring, as the few -- the very few -- English cavalry rode down the\nlaggards.",
                "Beyond the lines of the dead, a broad blood-stained Arab spear cast aside in\nthe retreat lay across a stump of scrub, and beyond this again the illimitable\ndark levels of the desert. The sun caught the steel and turned it into a red\ndisc. Some one behind him was saying, \"Ah, get away, you brute!\"\nDick raised his revolver and pointed towards the desert. His eye was held by\nthe red splash in the distance, and the clamour about him seemed to die down to\na very far-away whisper, like the whisper of a level sea. There was the\nrevolver and the red light.... and the voice of some one scaring something\naway, exactly as had fallen somewhere before, -- a darkness that stung. He\nfired at random, and the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered,\n\"Spoilt my aim. There aren't any more cartridges. We shall have to\nrun home.\" He put his hand to his head and brought it away covered with\nblood.",
                "\"Old man, you're cut rather badly,\" said Torpenhow. \"I\nowe you something for this business. Thanks. Stand up! I say, you can't\nbe ill here.\"",
                "Throughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats, a black\nfigure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and shouted that Khartoum\nthe accursed one was dead, -- was dead, -- was dead, -- that two\nsteamers were rock-staked on the Nile outside the city, and that of all their\ncrews there remained not one; and Khartoum was dead, -- was dead, -- was\ndead!",
                "But Torpenhow took no heed. He was watching Dick, who called aloud to the\nrestless Nile for Maisie, -- and again Maisie!",
                "\"Behold a phenomenon,\" said Torpenhow, rearranging the blanket.\n\"Here is a man, presumably human, who mentions the name of one woman\nonly. And I've seen a good deal of delirium, too. -- Dick,\nhere's some fizzy drink.\"",

Binat sat upon a chair and stared with eyes\nthat saw nothing, till the whirl of the dance and the clang of the rattling\npiano stole into the drink that took the place of blood in his veins, and his\nface glistened. Dick took him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the\nlight. Madame Binat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth. Dick\nleaned against the wall and sketched for an hour, till the kerosene lamps began\nto smell, and the girls threw themselves panting on the hard-beaten ground.\nThen he shut his book with a snap and moved away, Binat plucking feebly at his\nelbow. \"Show me,\" he whimpered. \"I too was once an artist,\neven I!\" Dick showed him the rough sketch. \"Am I that?\" he\nscreamed. \"Will you take that away with you and show all the world that\nit is I, -- Binat?\" He moaned and wept.",
                "\"Monsieur has paid for all,\" said Madame. \"To the pleasure of\nseeing Monsieur again.\"",
                "The courtyard gate shut, and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the nearest\ngambling-hell, where he was well known. \"If the luck holds, it's an\nomen; if I lose, I must stay here.\" He placed his money picturesquely\nabout the board, hardly daring to look at what he did. The luck held.",
                "Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds, and he went down to\nthe shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed cargo-steamer, who\nlanded him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket than he cared to think\nabout.",
                "A thin gray fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for summer\nwas in England.",
                "\"It's a cheerful wilderness, and it hasn't the knack of\naltering much,\" Dick thought, as he tramped from the Docks westward.\n\"Now, what must I do?\"",
                "The packed houses gave no answer. Dick looked down the long lightless streets\nand at the appalling rush of traffic. \"Oh, you rabbit-hutches!\"\nsaid he, addressing a row of highly respectable semi-detached residences.\n\"Do you know what you've got to do later on? You have to supply me\nwith men-servants and maid-servants,\" -- here he smacked his\nlips, -- \"and the peculiar treasure of kings. Meantime I'll find\nclothes and boots, and presently I will return and trample on you.\" He\nstepped forward energetically; he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the\nside. As he stooped to make investigations, a man jostled him into the gutter.\n\"All right,\" he said.",
                "\"That's another nick in the score. I'll jostle you later\non.\"",
                "Good clothes and boots are not cheap, and Dick left his last shop with the\ncertainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time, but with only fifty\nshillings in his pocket. He returned to streets by the Docks, and lodged\nhimself in one room, where the sheets on the bed were almost audibly marked in\ncase of theft, and where nobody seemed to go to bed at all. When his clothes\narrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate for Torpenhow's address,\nand got it, with the intimation that there was still some money waiting for\nhim.",
                "\"How much?\" said Dick, as one who habitually dealt in millions.",
                "\"Between thirty and forty pounds. If it would be any convenience to you,\nof course we could let you have it at once; but we usually settle accounts\nmonthly.\"",
                "\"If I show that I want anything now, I'm lost,\" he said to\nhimself. \"All I need I'll take later on.\" Then, aloud,\n\"It's hardly worth while; and I'm going to the country for a\nmonth, too. Wait till I come back, and I'll see about it.\"",
                "\"But we trust, Mr. Heldar, that you do not intend to sever your\nconnection with us?\"",
                "Dick's business in life was the study of faces, and he watched the\nspeaker keenly. \"That man means something,\" he said.\n\"I'll do no business till I've seen Torpenhow. There's\na big deal coming.\" So he departed, making no promises, to his one little\nroom by the Docks. And that day was the seventh of the month, and that month,\nhe reckoned with awful distinctness, had thirty-one days in it!",
                "It is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for\ntwenty-four days on fifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment\nalone in all the loneliness of London. Dick paid seven shillings a week for his\nlodging, which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink.\nNaturally, his first purchase was of the materials of his craft; he had been\nwithout them too long. Half a day's investigations and comparison brought\nhim to the conclusion that sausages and mashed potatoes, twopence a plate, were\nthe best food. Now, sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not\nunpleasant. As lunch, even, with mashed potatoes, they become monotonous. At\ndinner they are impertinent. At the end of three days Dick loathed sausages,\nand, going forth, pawned his watch to revel on sheep's head, which is not\nas cheap as it looks, owing to the bones and the gravy. Then he returned to\nsausages and mashed potatoes. Then he confined himself entirely to mashed\npotatoes for a day, and was unhappy because of pain in his inside. Then he\npawned his waistcoat and his tie, and thought regretfully of money thrown away\nin times past. There are few things more edifying unto Art than the actual\nbelly-pinch of hunger, and Dick in his few walks abroad, -- he did not care\nfor exercise; it raised desires that could not be satisfied -- found himself\ndividing mankind into two classes, -- those who looked as if they might give\nhim something to eat, and those who looked otherwise. \"I never knew what\nI had to learn about the human face before,\" he thought; and, as a reward\nfor his humility, Providence caused a cab-driver at a sausage-shop where Dick\nfed that night to leave half eaten a great chunk of bread. Dick took\nit, -- would have fought all the world for its possession, -- and it\ncheered him.",
                "The month dragged through at last, and, nearly prancing with impatience, he\nwent to draw his money. Then he hastened to Torpenhow's address and smelt\nthe smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers. Torpenhow\nwas on the top floor, and Dick burst into his room, to be received with a hug\nwhich nearly cracked his ribs, as Torpenhow dragged him to the light and spoke\nof twenty different things in the same breath.",
                "\"But you're looking tucked up,\" he concluded.",
                "\"Got anything to eat?\" said Dick, his eye roaming round the room.",
                "\"I shall be having breakfast in a minute. What do you say to\nsausages?\"",
                "\"No, anything but sausages! Torp, I've been starving on that\naccursed horse-flesh for thirty days and thirty nights.\"",
                "\"Now, what lunacy has been your latest?\"",
                "Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech. Then he opened his\ncoat; there was no waistcoat below. \"I ran it fine, awfully fine, but\nI've just scraped through.\"",
                "\"You haven't much sense, but you've got a backbone, anyhow.\nEat, and talk afterwards.\" Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till\nhe could gorge no more. Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe, and he smoked as\nmen smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco.",
                "\"Ouf!\" said he. \"That's heavenly! Well?\"",
                "\"Why in the world didn't you come to me?\"",
                "\"Couldn't; I owe you too much already, old man. Besides I had a\nsort of superstition that this temporary starvation -- that's what it\nwas, and it hurt -- would bring me luck later. It's over and done with\nnow, and none of the syndicate know how hard up I was. Fire away. What's\nthe exact state of affairs as regards myself?\"",
                "\"You had my wire? You've caught on here. People like your work\nimmensely. I don't know why, but they do. They say you have a fresh touch\nand a new way of drawing things. And, because they're chiefly home-bred\nEnglish, they say you have insight. You're wanted by half a dozen papers;\nyou're wanted to illustrate books.\"",
                "Dick grunted scornfully.",
                "\"You're wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to\nthe dealers. They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment.",
                "Good Lord! who can account for the fathomless folly of the public?\"",
                "\"They're a remarkably sensible people.\"",
                "\"They are subject to fits, if that's what you mean; and you happen\nto be the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they\ncall Art. Just now you're a fashion, a phenomenon, or whatever you\nplease. I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you here, and\nI have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me from\ntime to time. Those coming after your work on the Central Southern Syndicate\nappear to have done your business. You're in luck.\"",
                "\"Huh! call it luck! Do call it luck, when a man has been kicking about\nthe world like a dog, waiting for it to come! I'll luck 'em later\non. I want a place to work first.\"",
                "\"Come here,\" said Torpenhow, crossing the landing. \"This\nplace is a big box room really, but it will do for you. There's your\nskylight, or your north light, or whatever window you call it, and plenty of\nroom to thrash about in, and a bedroom beyond. What more do you need?\"",
                "\"Good enough,\" said Dick, looking round the large room that took up\na third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames. A pale\nyellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the place.\nThree steps led from the door to the landing, and three more to\nTorpenhow's room. The well of the staircase disappeared into darkness,\npricked by tiny gas-jets, and there were sounds of men talking and doors\nslamming seven flights below, in the warm gloom.",
                "\"Do they give you a free hand here?\" said Dick, cautiously. He was\nIshmael enough to know the value of liberty.",
                "\"Anything you like; latch-keys and license unlimited. We are permanent\ntenants for the most part here. 'Tisn't a place I would recommend\nfor a Young Men's Christian Association, but it will serve. I took these\nrooms for you when I wired.\"",
                "\"You're a great deal too kind, old man.\"",
                "\"You didn't suppose you were going away from me, did you?\"\nTorpenhow put his hand on Dick's shoulder, and the two walked up and down\nthe room, henceforward to be called the studio, in sweet and silent communion.\nThey heard rapping at Torpenhow's door. \"That's some ruffian\ncome up for a drink,\" said Torpenhow; and he raised his voice cheerily.\nThere entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middle-aged gentleman in a\nsatin-faced frockcoat. His lips were parted and pale, and there were deep\npouches under the eyes.",
                "\"Weak heart,\" said Dick to himself, and, as he shook hands,\n\"very weak heart. His pulse is shaking his fingers.\"",
                "The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate and\n\"one of the most ardent admirers of your work, Mr. Heldar. I assure you,\nin the name of the syndicate, that we are immensely indebted to you; and I\ntrust, Mr. Heldar, you won't forget that we were largely instrumental in\nbringing you before the public.\" He panted because of the seven flights\nof stairs.",
                "Dick glanced at Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his\ncheek.",
                "\"I shan't forget,\" said Dick, every instinct of defence\nroused in him.",
                "\"You've paid me so well that I couldn't, you know. By the\nway, when I am settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches.\nThere must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you.\"",
                "\"That is er -- is what I came to speak about. I fear we can't\nallow it exactly, Mr. Heldar. In the absence of any specified agreement, the\nsketches are our property, of course.\"",
                "\"Do you mean to say that you are going to keep them?\"",
                "\"Yes; and we hope to have your help, on your own terms, Mr. Heldar, to\nassist us in arranging a little exhibition, which, backed by our name and the\ninfluence we naturally command among the press, should be of material service\nto you. Sketches such as yours --  -- \"",
                "\"Belong to me. You engaged me by wire, you paid me the lowest rates you\ndared. You can't mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they're\nall I've got in the world!\"",
                "Torpenhow watched Dick's face and whistled.",
                "Dick walked up and down, thinking. He saw the whole of his little stock in\ntrade, the first weapon of his equipment, annexed at the outset of his campaign\nby an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught aright, who said that he\nrepresented a syndicate, which was a thing for which Dick had not the least\nreverence. The injustice of the proceedings did not much move him; he had seen\nthe strong hand prevail too often in other places to be squeamish over the\nmoral aspects of right and wrong.",
                "But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat, and when\nhe spoke again, and when he spoke again it was with a strained sweetness that\nTorpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife.",
                "\"Forgive me, sir, but you have no -- no younger man who can arrange\nthis business with me?\"",
                "\"I speak for the syndicate. I see no reason for a third party\nto --  -- \"",
                "\"You will in a minute. Be good enough to give back my sketches.\"",
                "The man stared blankly at Dick, and then at Torpenhow, who was leaning against\nthe wall. He was not used to ex-employees who ordered him to be good enough to\ndo things.",
                "\"Yes, it is rather a cold-blooded steal,\" said Torpenhow,\ncritically; \"but I'm afraid, I am very much afraid, you've\nstruck the wrong man. Be careful, Dick; remember, this isn't the\nSoudan.\"",
                "\"Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your\nname before the world --  -- \"",
                "This was not a fortunate remark; it reminded Dick of certain vagrant years\nlived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires. The memory did not\ncontrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the fruit of\nthose years.",
                "\"I don't know quite what to do with you,\" began Dick,\nmeditatively. \"Of course you're a thief, and you ought to be half\nkilled, but in your case you'd probably die. I don't want you dead\non this floor, and, besides, it's unlucky just as one's moving in.\nDon't hit, sir; you'll only excite yourself.\"",
                "He put one hand on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump\nbody beneath the coat. \"My goodness!\" said he to Torpenhow,\n\"and this gray oaf dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh camel-driver\nhave the black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of\nwet dates, and he was as tough as whipcord. This things' soft all\nover -- like a woman.\"",
                "There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a man\nwho does not intend to strike. The head of the syndicate began to breathe\nheavily. Dick walked round him, pawing him, as a cat paws a soft hearth-rug.\nThen he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches underneath the eyes, and\nshook his head. \"You were going to steal my things, -- mine, mine,\nmine! -- you, who don't know when you may die. Write a note to your\noffice, -- you say you're the head of it, -- and order them to give\nTorpenhow my sketches, -- every one of them. Wait a minute: your\nhand's shaking. Now!\" He thrust a pocket-book before him. The note\nwas written. Torpenhow took it and departed without a word, while Dick walked\nround and round the spellbound captive, giving him such advice as he conceived\nbest for the welfare of his soul. When Torpenhow returned with a gigantic\nportfolio, he heard Dick say, almost soothingly, \"Now, I hope this will\nbe a lesson to you; and if you worry me when I have settled down to work with\nany nonsense about actions for assault, believe me, I'll catch you and\nmanhandle you, and you'll die. You haven't very long to live,\nanyhow. Go! Imshi, Vootsak, -- get out!\" The man departed,\nstaggering and dazed. Dick drew a long breath: \"Phew! what a lawless lot\nthese people are! The first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery,\norganised burglary! Think of the hideous blackness of that man's mind!\nAre my sketches all right, Torp?\"",
                "\"Yes; one hundred and forty-seven of them. Well, I must say, Dick,\nyou've begun well.\"",
                "\"He was interfering with me. It only meant a few pounds to him, but it\nwas everything to me. I don't think he'll bring an action. I gave\nhim some medical advice gratis about the state of his body. It was cheap at the\nlittle flurry it cost him. Now, let's look at my things.\"",
                "Two minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep in the\nportfolio, chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and thought of the\nprice at which they had been bought.",
                "The afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw Dick\ndancing a wild saraband under the skylight.",
                "\"I builded better than I knew, Torp,\" he said, without stopping the\ndance.",
                "\"They're good! They're damned good! They'll go like\nflame! I shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook. And that man\nwould have cheated me out of it! Do you know that I'm sorry now that I\ndidn't actually hit him?\"",
                "\"Go out,\" said Torpenhow, -- \"go out and pray to be\ndelivered from the sin of arrogance, which you never will be. Bring your things\nup from whatever place you're staying in, and we'll try to make\nthis barn a little more shipshape.\"",
                "\"And then -- oh, then,\" said Dick, still capering, \"we\nwill spoil the Egyptians!\"",

                "\"There's a good working light now,\" he said, watching his\nshadow placidly. \"Some poor devil ought to be grateful for this. And\nthere's Maisie.\"",
                "She was walking towards him from the Marble Arch, and he saw that no mannerism\nof her gait had been changed. It was good to find her still Maisie, and, so to\nspeak, his next-door neighbour. No greeting passed between them, because there\nhad been none in the old days.",
                "\"What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?\" said Dick, as\none who was entitled to ask.",
                "\"Idling. Just idling. I got angry with a chin and scraped it out. Then I\nleft it in a little heap of paint-chips and came away.\"",
                "\"I know what palette-knifing means. What was the piccy?\"",
                "\"A fancy head that wouldn't come right, -- horrid thing!\"",
                "\"I don't like working over scraped paint when I'm doing\nflesh. The grain comes up woolly as the paint dries.\"",
                "\"Not if you scrape properly.\" Maisie waved her hand to illustrate\nher methods. There was a dab of paint on the white cuff. Dick laughed.",
                "\"You're as untidy as ever.\"",
                "\"That comes well from you. Look at your own cuff.\"",
                "\"By Jove, yes! It's worse than yours. I don't think\nwe've much altered in anything. Let's see, though.\" He looked\nat Maisie critically. The pale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the\ntree-trunks of the Park and made a background for the gray dress, the black\nvelvet toque above the black hair, and the resolute profile.",
                "\"No, there's nothing changed. How good it is! D'you remember\nwhen I fastened your hair into the snap of a hand-bag?\"",
                "Maisie nodded, with a twinkle in her eyes, and turned her full face to Dick.",
                "\"Wait a minute,\" said he. \"That mouth is down at the corners\na little.",
                "Who's been worrying you, Maisie?\"",
                "\"No one but myself. I never seem to get on with my work, and yet I try\nhard enough, and Kami says --  -- \"",
                "\"'Continuez, mesdemoiselles. Continuez toujours, mes\nenfants.' Kami is depressing. I beg your pardon.\"",
                "\"Yes, that's what he says. He told me last summer that I was doing\nbetter and he'd let me exhibit this year.\"",
                "\"Not in this place, surely?\"",
                "\"Of course not. The Salon.\"",
                "\"You fly high.\"",
                "\"I've been beating my wings long enough. Where do you exhibit,\nDick?\"",
                "\"I don't exhibit. I sell.\"",
                "\"What is your line, then?\"",
                "\"Haven't you heard?\" Dick's eyes opened. Was this thing\npossible? He cast about for some means of conviction. They were not far from\nthe Marble Arch. \"Come up Oxford Street a little and I'll show\nyou.\"",
                "A small knot of people stood round a print-shop that Dick knew well.",
                "\"Some reproduction of my work inside,\" he said, with suppressed\ntriumph. Never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue. \"You\nsee the sort of things I paint. D'you like it?\"",
                "Maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a field-battery going into action\nunder fire. Two artillery-men stood behind her in the crowd.",
                "\"They've chucked the off lead-'orse' said one to the\nother. \"'E's tore up awful, but they're makin'\ngood time with the others. That lead-driver drives better nor you, Tom. See\n'ow cunnin' 'e's nursin' 'is\n'orse.\"",
                "\"Number Three'll be off the limber, next jolt,\" was the\nanswer.",
                "\"No, 'e won't. See 'ow 'is foot's braced\nagainst the iron? 'E's all right.\"",
                "Dick watched Maisie's face and swelled with joy -- fine, rank, vulgar\ntriumph. She was more interested in the little crowd than in the picture.",
                "That was something that she could understand.",
                "\"And I wanted it so! Oh, I did want it so!\" she said at last, under\nher breath.",
                "\"Me, -- all me!\" said Dick, placidly. \"Look at their\nfaces. It hits 'em. They don't know what makes their eyes and\nmouths open; but I know. And I know my work's right.\"",
                "\"Yes. I see. Oh, what a thing to have come to one!\"",
                "\"Come to one, indeed! I had to go out and look for it. What do you\nthink?\"",
                "\"I call it success. Tell me how you got it.\"",
                "They returned to the Park, and Dick delivered himself of the saga of his own\ndoings, with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman.",
                "From the beginning he told the tale, the I -- I -- I's flashing\nthrough the records as telegraph-poles fly past the traveller. Maisie listened\nand nodded her head. The histories of strife and privation did not move her a\nhair's-breadth. At the end of each canto he would conclude, \"And\nthat gave me some notion of handling colour,\" or light, or whatever it\nmight be that he had set out to pursue and understand. He led her breathless\nacross half the world, speaking as he had never spoken in his life before.",
                "And in the flood-tide of his exaltation there came upon him a great desire to\npick up this maiden who nodded her head and said, \"I understand. Go\non,\" -- to pick her up and carry her away with him, because she was\nMaisie, and because she understood, and because she was his right, and a woman\nto be desired above all women.",
                "Then he checked himself abruptly. \"And so I took all I wanted,\" he\nsaid, \"and I had to fight for it. Now you tell.\"",
                "Maisie's tale was almost as gray as her dress. It covered years of\npatient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken thought dealers\nlaughed, and fogs delayed work, and Kami was unkind and even sarcastic, and\ngirls in other studios were painfully polite. It had a few bright spots, in\npictures accepted at provincial exhibitions, but it wound up with the oft\nrepeated wail, \"And so you see, Dick, I had no success, though I worked\nso hard.\"",
                "Then pity filled Dick. Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not hit the\nbreakwater, half an hour before she had kissed him. And that had happened\nyesterday.",
                "\"Never mind,\" he said. \"I'll tell you something, if\nyou'll believe it.\" The words were shaping themselves of their own\naccord. \"The whole thing, lock, stock, and barrel, isn't worth one\nbig yellow sea-poppy below Fort Keeling.\"",
                "Maisie flushed a little. \"It's all very well for you to talk, but\nyou've had the success and I haven't.\"",
                "\"Let me talk, then. I know you'll understand. Maisie, dear, it\nsounds a bit absurd, but those ten years never existed, and I've come\nback again. It really is just the same. Can't you see? You're alone\nnow and I'm alone.",
                "What's the use of worrying? Come to me instead, darling.\"",
                "Maisie poked the gravel with her parasol. They were sitting on a bench.",
                "\"I understand,\" she said slowly. \"But I've got my work\nto do, and I must do it.\"",
                "\"Do it with me, then, dear. I won't interrupt.\"",
                "\"No, I couldn't. It's my\nwork, -- mine, -- mine, -- mine! I've been alone all my life in\nmyself, and I'm not going to belong to anybody except myself. I remember\nthings as well as you do, but that doesn't count. We were babies then,\nand we didn't know what was before us. Dick, don't be selfish. I\nthink I see my way to a little success next year. Don't take it away from\nme.\"",
                "\"I beg your pardon, darling. It's my fault for speaking stupidly. I\ncan't expect you to throw up all your life just because I'm back.\nI'll go to my own place and wait a little.\"",
                "\"But, Dick, I don't want you to -- go -- out of -- my\nlife, now you've just come back.\"",
                "\"I'm at your orders; forgive me.\" Dick devoured the troubled\nlittle face with his eyes. There was triumph in them, because he could not\nconceive that Maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him, since he loved\nher.",
                "\"It's wrong of me,\" said Maisie, more slowly than before;\n\"it's wrong and selfish; but, oh, I've been so lonely! No,\nyou misunderstand. Now I've seen you again, -- it's absurd, but\nI want to keep you in my life.\"",
                "\"Naturally. We belong.\"",
                "\"We don't; but you always understood me, and there is so much in my\nwork that you could help me in. You know things and the ways of doing things.\nYou must.\"",
                "\"I do, I fancy, or else I don't know myself. Then you won't\ncare to lose sight of me altogether, and -- you want me to help you in your\nwork?\"",
                "\"Yes; but remember, Dick, nothing will ever come of it. That's why\nI feel so selfish. Can't things stay as they are? I do want your\nhelp.\"",
                "\"You shall have it. But let's consider. I must see your pics first,\nand overhaul your sketches, and find out about your tendencies. You should see\nwhat the papers say about my tendencies! Then I'll give you good advice,\nand you shall paint according. Isn't that it, Maisie?\"",
                "Again there was triumph in Dick's eye.",
                "\"It's too good of you, -- much too good. Because you are\nconsoling yourself with what will never happen, and I know that, and yet I want\nto keep you. Don't blame me later, please.\"",
                "\"I'm going into the matter with my eyes open. Moreover the Queen\ncan do no wrong. It isn't your selfishness that impresses me. It's\nyour audacity in proposing to make use of me.\"",
                "\"Pooh! You're only Dick, -- and a print-shop.\"",
                "\"Very good: that's all I am. But, Maisie, you believe, don't\nyou, that I love you? I don't want you to have any false notions about\nbrothers and sisters.\"",
                "Maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes.",
                "\"It's absurd, but -- I believe. I wish I could send you away\nbefore you get angry with me. But -- but the girl that lives with me is\nred-haired, and an impressionist, and all our notions clash.\"",
                "\"So do ours, I think. Never mind. Three months from to-day we shall be\nlaughing at this together.\"",
                "Maisie shook her head mournfully. \"I knew you wouldn't understand,\nand it will only hurt you more when you find out. Look at my face, Dick, and\ntell me what you see.\"",
                "They stood up and faced each other for a moment. The fog was gathering, and it\nstifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings. Dick brought all\nhis painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes, mouth, and chin\nunderneath the black velvet toque.",
                "\"It's the same Maisie, and it's the same me,\" he said.\n\"We've both nice little wills of our own, and one or other of us\nhas to be broken. Now about the future. I must come and see your pictures some\nday, -- I suppose when the red-haired girl is on the premises.\"",
                "\"Sundays are my best times. You must come on Sundays. There are such\nheaps of things I want to talk about and ask your advice about. Now I must get\nback to work.\"",
                "\"Try to find out before next Sunday what I am,\" said Dick.\n\"Don't take my word for anything I've told you. Good-bye,\ndarling, and bless you.\"",
                "Maisie stole away like a little gray mouse. Dick watched her till she was out\nof sight, but he did not hear her say to herself, very soberly,\n\"I'm a wretch, -- a horrid, selfish wretch. But it's Dick,\nand Dick will understand.\"",
                "No one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force meets\nthe immovable post, though many have thought deeply, even as Dick thought. He\ntried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in a few weeks by his mere\npresence and discourse to a better way of thinking. Then he remembered much too\ndistinctly her face and all that was written on it.",
                "\"If I know anything of heads,\" he said, \"there's\neverything in that face but love. I shall have to put that in myself; and that\nchin and mouth won't be won for nothing. But she's right. She knows\nwhat she wants, and she's going to get it. What insolence! Me! Of all the\npeople in the wide world, to use me! But then she's Maisie. There's\nno getting over that fact; and it's good to see her again. This business\nmust have been simmering at the back of my head for years.... She'll use\nme as I used Binat at Port Said.",
                "She's quite right. It will hurt a little. I shall have to see her every\nSunday, -- like a young man courting a housemaid. She's sure to come\naround; and yet -- that mouth isn't a yielding mouth. I shall be\nwanting to kiss her all the time, and I shall have to look at her\npictures, -- I don't even know what sort of work she does\nyet, -- and I shall have to talk about Art, -- Woman's Art!\nTherefore, particularly and perpetually, damn all varieties of Art. It did me a\ngood turn once, and now it's in my way. I'll go home and do some\nArt.\"",
                "Half-way to the studio, Dick was smitten with a terrible thought. The figure of\na solitary woman in the fog suggested it.",
                "\"She's all alone in London, with a red-haired impressionist girl,\nwho probably has the digestion of an ostrich. Most red-haired people have.",
                "Maisie's a bilious little body. They'll eat like lone\nwomen, -- meals at all hours, and tea with all meals. I remember how the\nstudents in Paris used to pig along. She may fall ill at any minute, and I\nshan't be able to help.",
                "Whew! this is ten times worse than owning a wife.\"",
                "Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk, and looked at Dick with eyes full of the\naustere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same oar\ntogether and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil. This is a\ngood love, and, since it allows, and even encourages, strife, recrimination,\nand brutal sincerity, does not die, but grows, and is proof against any absence\nand evil conduct.",
                "Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council. He\nthought of Maisie and her possible needs. It was a new thing to think of\nanybody but Torpenhow, who could think for himself. Here at last was an outlet\nfor that cash balance. He could adorn Maisie barbarically with jewelry, -- a\nthick gold necklace round that little neck, bracelets upon the rounded arms,\nand rings of price upon her hands, -- the cool, temperate, ringless hands\nthat he had taken between his own. It was an absurd thought, for Maisie would\nnot even allow him to put one ring on one finger, and she would laugh at golden\ntrappings. It would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk, his arm\naround her neck and her face on his shoulder, as befitted husband and wife.\nTorpenhow's boots creaked that night, and his strong voice jarred.\nDick's brows contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had taken\nall his success as a right and part payment for past discomfort, and now he was\nchecked in his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not\ninstantly care for him.",
                "\"I say, old man,\" said Torpenhow, who had made one or two vain\nattempts at conversation, \"I haven't put your back up by anything\nI've said lately, have I?\"",
                "\"You! No. How could you?\"",
                "\"Liver out of order?\"",
                "\"The truly healthy man doesn't know he has a liver. I'm only\na bit worried about things in general. I suppose it's my soul.\"",
                "\"The truly healthy man doesn't know he has a soul. What business\nhave you with luxuries of that kind?\"",
                "\"It came of itself. Who's the man that says that we're all\nislands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?\"",
                "\"He's right, whoever he is, -- except about the\nmisunderstanding. I don't think we could misunderstand each other.\"",
                "The blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds. Then Torpenhow,\ninsinuatingly -- \"Dick, is it a woman?\"",
                "\"Be hanged if it's anything remotely resembling a woman; and if you\nbegin to talk like that, I'll hire a red-brick studio with white paint\ntrimmings, and begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among\nthree-and-sixpenny pot-palms, and I'll mount all my pics in aniline-dye\nplush plasters, and I'll invite every woman who maunders over what her\nguide-books tell her is Art, and you shall receive 'em, Torp, -- in a\nsnuff-brown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie. You'll\nlike that?\"",
                "\"Too thin, Dick. A better man than you once denied with cursing and\nswearing. You've overdone it, just as he did. It's no business of\nmine, of course, but it's comforting to think that somewhere under the\nstars there's saving up for you a tremendous thrashing. Whether\nit'll come from heaven or earth, I don't know, but it's bound\nto come and break you up a little. You want hammering.\"",
                "Dick shivered. \"All right,\" said he. \"When this island is\ndisintegrated, it will call for you.\"",

                "Some weeks later, on a very foggy Sunday, Dick was returning across the Park to\nhis studio. \"This,\" he said, \"is evidently the thrashing that\nTorp meant. It hurts more than I expected; but the Queen can do no wrong; and\nshe certainly has some notion of drawing.\"",
                "He had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisie, -- always under the green\neyes of the red-haired impressionist girl, whom he learned to hate at\nsight, -- and was tingling with a keen sense of shame. Sunday after Sunday,\nputting on his best clothes, he had walked over to the untidy house north of\nthe Park, first to see Maisie's pictures, and then to criticise and\nadvise upon them as he realised that they were productions on which advice\nwould not be wasted. Sunday after Sunday, and his love grew with each visit, he\nhad been compelled to cram his heart back from between his lips when it\nprompted him to kiss Maisie several times and very much indeed. Sunday after\nSunday, the head above the heart had warned him that Maisie was not yet\nattainable, and that it would be better to talk as connectedly as possible upon\nthe mysteries of the craft that was all in all to her. Therefore it was his\nfate to endure weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back\ngarden of a frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place\nand nobody every called, -- to endure and to watch Maisie moving to and fro\nwith the teacups. He abhorred tea, but, since it gave him a little longer time\nin her presence, he drank it devoutly, and the red-haired girl sat in an untidy\nheap and eyed him without speaking. She was always watching him.",
                "Once, and only once, when she had left the studio, Maisie showed him an album\nthat held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers, -- the briefest of\nhurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying exhibitions. Dick\nstooped and kissed the paint-smudged thumb on the open page. \"Oh, my\nlove, my love,\" he muttered, \"do you value these things? Chuck\n'em into the waste-paper basket!\"",
                "\"Not till I get something better,\" said Maisie, shutting the book.",
                "Then Dick, moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for the\nmaiden, did deliberately propose, in order to secure more of these coveted\ncuttings, that he should paint a picture which Maisie should sign.",
                "\"That's childish,\" said Maisie, \"and I didn't\nthink it of you. It must be my work. Mine, -- mine, -- mine!\"",
                "\"Go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers' houses. You\nare thoroughly good at that.\" Dick was sick and savage.",
                "\"Better things than medallions, Dick,\" was the answer, in tones\nthat recalled a gray-eyed atom's fearless speech to Mrs. Jennett. Dick\nwould have abased himself utterly, but that other girl trailed in.",
                "Next Sunday he laid at Maisie's feet small gifts of pencils that could\nalmost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed, and he\nwas ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand. It demanded, among other\nthings, an exposition of the faith that was in him.",
                "Torpenhow's hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with\nwhich Dick preached his own gospel of Art.",
                "A month before, Dick would have been equally astonished; but it was\nMaisie's will and pleasure, and he dragged his words together to make\nplain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys and\nwherefores of work. There is not the least difficulty in doing a thing if you\nonly know how to do it; the trouble is to explain your method.",
                "\"I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand,\" said Dick,\ndespairingly, over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would not\n\"look flesh,\" -- it was the same chin that she had scraped out\nwith the palette knife, -- \"but I find it almost impossible to teach\nyou. There's a queer grim, Dutch touch about your painting that I like;\nbut I've a notion that you're weak in drawing. You foreshorten as\nthough you never used the model, and you've caught Kami's pasty way\nof dealing with flesh in shadow. Then, again, though you don't know it\nyourself, you shirk hard work. Suppose you spend some of your time on line\nalone. Line doesn't allow of shirking. Oils do, and three square inches\nof flashy, tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing\noff, -- as I know. That's immoral. Do line-work for a little while,\nand then I can tell more about your powers, as old Kami used to say.\"",
                "Maisie protested; she did not care for the pure line.",
                "\"I know,\" said Dick. \"You want to do your fancy heads with a\nbunch of flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling.\" The\nred-haired girl laughed a little. \"You want to do landscapes with cattle\nknee-deep in grass to hide bad drawing. You want to do a great deal more than\nyou can do. You have sense of colour, but you want form. Colour's a\ngift, -- put it aside and think no more about it, -- but form you can be\ndrilled into.",
                "Now, all your fancy heads -- and some of them are very good -- will keep\nyou exactly where you are. With line you must go forward or backward, and it\nwill show up all your weaknesses.\"",
                "\"But other people --  -- \" began Maisie.",
                "\"You mustn't mind what other people do. If their souls were your\nsoul, it would be different. You stand and fall by your own work, remember, and\nit's waste of time to think of any one else in this battle.\"",
                "Dick paused, and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came back\ninto his eyes. He looked at Maisie, and the look asked as plainly as words, Was\nit not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and counsel and join\nhands with Life and Love?",
                "Maisie assented to the new programme of schooling so adorably that Dick could\nhardly restrain himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off\nto the nearest registrar's office. It was the implicit obedience to the\nspoken word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and\nbuffeted his soul. He held authority in that house, -- authority limited,\nindeed, to one-half of one afternoon in seven, but very real while it lasted.\nMaisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects, from the proper packing\nof pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney. The red-haired girl never\nconsulted him about anything.",
                "On the other hand, she accepted his appearances without protest, and watched\nhim always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular\nand fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles, and biscuit, as he had\nsuspected from the beginning. The girls were supposed to market week and week\nabout, but they lived, with the help of a charwoman, as casually as the young\nravens. Maisie spent most of her income on models, and the other girl revelled\nin apparatus as refined as her work was rough. Armed with knowledge,\ndear-bought from the Docks, Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation\nmeant the crippling of power to work, which was considerably worse than death.",
                "Maisie took the warning, and gave more thought to what she ate and drank. When\nhis trouble returned upon him, as it generally did in the long winter\ntwilights, the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and his\ncoercion with a hearth-brush of the smoky drawing-room chimney stung Dick like\na whip-lash.",
                "He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings, till one\nSunday, the red-haired girl announced that she would make a study of\nDick's head, and that he would be good enough to sit still,\nand -- quite as an afterthought -- look at Maisie. He sat, because he\ncould not well refuse, and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all\nthe people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft.\nHe remembered Binat most distinctly, -- that Binat who had once been an\nartist and talked about degradation.",
                "It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head, but it presented the dumb\nwaiting, the longing, and, above all, the hopeless enslavement of the man, in a\nspirit of bitter mockery.",
                "\"I'll buy it,\" said Dick, promptly, \"at your own\nprice.\"",
                "\"My price is too high, but I dare say you'll be as grateful\nif --  -- \" The wet sketch, fluttered from the girl's hand\nand fell into the ashes of the studio stove. When she picked it up it was\nhopelessly smudged.",
                "\"Oh, it's all spoiled!\" said Maisie. \"And I never saw\nit. Was it like?\"",
                "\"Thank you,\" said Dick under his breath to the red-haired girl, and\nhe removed himself swiftly.",
                "\"How that man hates me!\" said the girl. \"And how he loves\nyou, Maisie!\"",
                "\"What nonsense? I knew Dick's very fond of me, but he had his work\nto do, and I have mine.\"",
                "\"Yes, he is fond of you, and I think he knows there is something in\nimpressionism, after all. Maisie, can't you see?\"",
                "\"See? See what?\"",
                "\"Nothing; only, I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that\nman looks at you, I'd -- I don't know what I'd do. But he\nhates me. Oh, how he hates me!\"",
                "She was not altogether correct. Dick's hatred was tempered with gratitude\nfor a few moments, and then he forgot the girl entirely. Only the sense of\nshame remained, and he was nursing it across the Park in the fog.\n\"There'll be an explosion one of these days,\" he said\nwrathfully. \"But it isn't Maisie's fault; she's right,\nquite right, as far as she knows, and I can't blame her. This business\nhas been going on for three months nearly.",
                "Three months! -- and it cost me ten years' knocking about to get at\nthe notion, the merest raw notion, of my work. That's true; but then I\ndidn't have pins, drawing-pins, and palette-knives, stuck into me every\nSunday.",
                "Oh, my little darling, if ever I break you, somebody will have a very bad time\nof it. No, she won't. I'd be as big a fool about her as I am now.\nI'll poison that red-haired girl on my wedding-day, -- she's\nunwholesome, -- and now I'll pass on these present bad times to\nTorp.\"",
                "Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the sin of\nlevity, and Dick had listened and replied not a word. In the weeks between the\nfirst few Sundays of his discipline he had flung himself savagely into his\nwork, resolved that Maisie should at least know the full stretch of his powers.\nThen he had taught Maisie that she must not pay the least attention to any work\noutside her own, and Maisie had obeyed him all too well. She took his counsels,\nbut was not interested in his pictures.",
                "\"Your things smell of tobacco and blood,\" she said once.\n\"Can't you do anything except soldiers?\"",
                "\"I could do a head of you that would startle you,\" thought\nDick, -- this was before the red-haired girl had brought him under the\nguillotine, -- but he only said, \"I am very sorry,\" and harrowed\nTorpenhow's soul that evening with blasphemies against Art. Later,\ninsensibly and to a large extent against his own will, he ceased to interest\nhimself in his own work.",
                "For Maisie's sake, and to soothe the self-respect that it seemed to him\nhe lost each Sunday, he would not consciously turn out bad stuff, but, since\nMaisie did not care even for his best, it were better not to do anything at all\nsave wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday. Torpenhow was disgusted as\nthe weeks went by fruitless, and then attacked him one Sunday evening when Dick\nfelt utterly exhausted after three hours' biting self-restraint in\nMaisie's presence. There was Language, and Torpenhow withdrew to consult\nthe Nilghai, who had come in to talk continental politics.",
                "\"Bone-idle, is he? Careless, and touched in the temper?\" said the\nNilghai.",
                "\"It isn't worth worrying over. Dick is probably playing the fool\nwith a woman.\"",
                "\"Isn't that bad enough?\"",
                "\"No. She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a\nwhile. She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase:\none never knows. But until Dick speaks of his own accord you had better not\ntouch him. He is no easy-tempered man to handle.\"",
                "\"No; I wish he were. He is such an aggressive, cocksure, you-be-damned\nfellow.\"",
                "\"He'll get that knocked out of him in time. He must learn that he\ncan't storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick\nbrush.",
                "You're fond of him?\"",
                "\"I'd take any punishment that's in store for him if I could;\nbut the worst of it is, no man can save his brother.\"",
                "\"No, and the worser of it is, there is no discharge in this war. Dick\nmust learn his lesson like the rest of us. Talking of war, there'll be\ntrouble in the Balkans in the spring.\"",
                "\"That trouble is long coming. I wonder if we could drag Dick out there\nwhen it comes off?\"",
                "Dick entered the room soon afterwards, and the question was put to him.",
                "\"Not good enough,\" he said shortly. \"I'm too\ncomf'y where I am.\"",
                "\"Surely you aren't taking all the stuff in the papers\nseriously?\" said the Nilghai. \"Your vogue will be ended in less\nthan six months, -- the public will know your touch and go on to something\nnew, -- and where will you be then?\"",
                "\"Here, in England.\"",
                "\"When you might be doing decent work among us out there? Nonsense! I\nshall go, the Keneu will be there, Torp will be there, Cassavetti will be\nthere, and the whole lot of us will be there, and we shall have as much as ever\nwe can do, with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that\nwould make the reputation of three Verestchagins.\"",
                "\"Um!\" said Dick, pulling at his pipe.",
                "\"You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your\npictures? Just think how full an average man's life is of his own\npursuits and pleasures. When twenty thousand of him find time to look up\nbetween mouthfuls and grunt something about something they aren't the\nleast interested in, the net result is called fame, reputation, or notoriety,\naccording to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord.\"",
                "\"I know that as well as you do. Give me credit for a little\ngumption.\"",
                "\"Be hanged if I do!\"",
                "\"Be hanged, then; you probably will be, -- for a spy, by\nexcited Turks. Heigh-ho! I'm weary, dead weary, and virtue has gone out\nof me.\" Dick dropped into a chair, and was fast asleep in a minute.",
                "\"That's a bad sign,\" said the Nilghai, in an undertone.",
                "Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to burn,\nand put a pillow behind the head. \"We can't help; we can't\nhelp,\" he said. \"It's a good ugly sort of old cocoanut, and\nI'm fond of it. There's the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut\nover in the square.\"",
                "\"Shouldn't wonder if that has made him a trifle mad.\"",
                "\"I should. He's a most businesslike madman.\"",
                "Then Dick began to snore furiously.",
                "\"Oh, here, no affection can stand this sort of thing. Wake up, Dick, and\ngo and sleep somewhere else, if you intend to make a noise about it.\"",
                "\"When a cat has been out on the tiles all night,\" said the Nilghai,\nin his beard, \"I notice that she usually sleeps all day. This is natural\nhistory.\"",
                "Dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning. In the night-watches he was\novertaken with an idea, so simple and so luminous that he wondered he had never\nconceived it before. It was full of craft. He would seek Maisie on a\nweek-day, -- would suggest an excursion, and would take her by train to Fort\nKeeling, over the very ground that they two had trodden together ten years ago.",
                "\"As a general rule,\" he explained to his chin-lathered reflection\nin the morning, \"it isn't safe to cross an old trail twice. Things\nremind one of things, and a cold wind gets up, and you feel sad; but this is an\nexception to every rule that ever was. I'll go to Maisie at once.\"",
                "Fortunately, the red-haired girl was out shopping when he arrived, and Maisie\nin a paint-spattered blouse was warring with her canvas. She was not pleased to\nsee him; for week-day visits were a stretch of the bond; and it needed all his\ncourage to explain his errand.",
                "\"I know you've been working too hard,\" he concluded, with an\nair of authority. \"If you do that, you'll break down. You had much\nbetter come.\"",
                "\"Where?\" said Maisie, wearily. She had been standing before her\neasel too long, and was very tired.",
                "\"Anywhere you please. We'll take a train to-morrow and see where it\nstops. We'll have lunch somewhere, and I'll bring you back in the\nevening.\"",
                "\"If there's a good working light to-morrow, I lose a day.\"\nMaisie balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely.",
                "Dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips. He had not yet learned\npatience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all.",
                "\"You'll lose ever so many more, dear, if you use every hour of\nworking light. Overwork's only murderous idleness. Don't be\nunreasonable. I'll call for you to-morrow after breakfast early.\"",
                "\"But surely you are going to ask --  -- \"",
                "\"No, I am not. I want you and nobody else. Besides, she hates me as much\nas I hate her. She won't care to come. To-morrow, then; and pray that we\nget sunshine.\"",
                "Dick went away delighted, and by consequence did no work whatever.",
                "He strangled a wild desire to order a special train, but bought a great gray\nkangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten, and then retired into himself to\nconsider things.",
                "\"I'm going out for the day to-morrow with Dick,\" said Maisie\nto the red-haired girl when the latter returned, tired, from marketing in the\nEdgware road.",
                "\"He deserves it. I shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed while\nyou're away. It's very dirty.\"",
                "Maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to the\nlittle excitement, but not without misgivings.",
                "\"There's nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly, she\nthought, but I'm sure he'll be silly and worry me, and I'm\nsure I can't tell him anything he'd like to hear. If he'd\nonly be sensible, I should like him so much better.\"",
                "Dick's eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning and\nsaw Maisie, gray-ulstered and black-velvet-hatted, standing in the hallway.\nPalaces of marble, and not sordid imitation of grained wood, were surely the\nfittest background for such a divinity. The red-haired girl drew her into the\nstudio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly.",
                "Maisie's eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead; she was altogether\nunused to these demonstrations. \"Mind my hat,\" she said, hurrying\naway, and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom.",
                "\"Are you quite warm enough! Are you sure you wouldn't like some\nmore breakfast? Put the cloak over you knees.\"",
                "\"I'm quite comf'y, thanks. Where are we going, Dick? Oh, do\nstop singing like that. People will think we're mad.\"",
                "\"Let 'em think, -- if the exertion doesn't kill them. They\ndon't know who we are, and I'm sure I don't care who they\nare. My faith, Maisie, you're looking lovely!\"",
                "Maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply. The wind of a keen\nclear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks. Overhead, the\ncreamy-yellow smoke-clouds were thinning away one by one against a pale-blue\nsky, and the improvident sparrows broke off from water-spout committees and\ncab-rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring.",
                "\"It will be lovely weather in the country,\" said Dick.",
                "\"But where are we going?\"",
                "\"Wait and see.\"",
                "They stopped at Victoria, and Dick sought tickets. For less than half the\nfraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie, comfortably settled by the\nwaiting-room fire, that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the\nbooking-office than to elbow one's own way through the crowd. Dick put\nher into a Pullman, -- solely on account of the warmth there; and she\nregarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved out\ninto the country.",
                "\"I wish I knew where we are going,\" she repeated for the twentieth\ntime.",
                "The name of a well-remembered station flashed by, towards the end of the run,\nand Maisie was delighted.",
                "\"Oh, Dick, you villain!\"",
                "\"Well, I thought you might like to see the place again. You haven't\nbeen here since the old times, have you?\"",
                "\"No. I never cared to see Mrs. Jennett again; and she was all that was\never there.\"",
                "\"Not quite. Look out a minute. There's the windmill above the\npotato-fields; they haven't built villas there yet; d'you remember\nwhen I shut you up in it?\"",
                "\"Yes. How she beat you for it! I never told it was you.\"",
                "\"She guessed. I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was\nburying Amomma alive in the potatoes, and you believed me. You had a trusting\nnature in those days.\"",
                "They laughed and leaned to look out, identifying ancient landmarks with many\nreminiscences. Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie's cheek,\nvery near his own, and watched the blood rise under the clear skin. He\ncongratulated himself upon his cunning, and looked that the evening would bring\nhim a great reward.",
                "When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes.\nFirst, but from a distance, they regarded the house of Mrs. Jennett.",
                "\"Suppose she should come out now, what would you do?\" said Dick,\nwith mock terror.",
                "\"I should make a face.\"",
                "\"Show, then,\" said Dick, dropping into the speech of childhood.",
                "Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa, and Dick\nlaughed.",
                "\"\"This is disgraceful,\"' said Maisie, mimicking Mrs.\nJennett's tone.",
                "\"\"Maisie, you run in at once, and learn the collect, gospel, and\nepistle for the next three Sundays. After all I've taught you, too, and\nthree helps every Sunday at dinner! Dick's always leading you into\nmischief. If you aren't a gentleman, Dick, you might at\nleast -- \"'",
                "The sentence ended abruptly. Maisie remembered when it had last been used.",
                "\"\"Try to behave like one,\"' said Dick, promptly.\n\"Quite right. Now we'll get some lunch and go on to Fort\nKeeling, -- unless you'd rather drive there?\"",
                "\"We must walk, out of respect to the place. How little changed it all\nis!\"",
                "They turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets, and the\ninfluence of old things lay upon them. Presently they passed a\nconfectioner's shop much considered in the days when their joint\npocket-money amounted to a shilling a week.",
                "\"Dick, have you any pennies?\" said Maisie, half to herself.",
                "\"Only three; and if you think you're going to have two of 'em\nto buy peppermints with, you're wrong. She says peppermints aren't\nladylike.\"",
                "Again they laughed, and again the colour came into Maisie's cheeks as the\nblood boiled through Dick's heart. After a large lunch they went down to\nthe beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste, wind-bitten land that no\nbuilder had thought it worth his while to defile. The winter breeze came in\nfrom the sea and sang about their ears.",
                "\"Maisie,\" said Dick, \"your nose is getting a crude Prussian\nblue at the tip.",
                "I'll race you as far as you please for as much as you please.\"",
                "She looked round cautiously, and with a laugh set off, swiftly as the ulster\nallowed, till she was out of breath.",
                "\"We used to run miles,\" she panted. \"It's absurd that\nwe can't run now.\"",
                "\"Old age, dear. This it is to get fat and sleek in town. When I wished to\npull your hair you generally ran for three miles, shrieking at the top of your\nvoice. I ought to know, because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up\nMrs. Jennett with a cane and --  -- \"",

Then a monkey -- a little black\nmonkey -- walks through the main square to get a drink from a tank forty\nfeet deep.

Then the\nnight-wind gets up, and the sands move, and you hear the desert outside the\ncity singing, \"Now I lay me down to sleep,\" and everything is dark\ntill the moon rises.

It's very lovely, and it's very horrible, -- but I\nwon't let you see anything horrid, -- and it doesn't care your\nlife or mine for pictures or anything else except doing its own work and making\nlove.

It was a small coin in itself, but\nMaisie had given it, and the Thames held it, and surely the Fates would be\nbribed for this once.",
                "The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie for the\nmoment. He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his chambers with\na strong yearning for some man-talk and tobacco after his first experience of\nan entire day spent in the society of a woman.

                "Dick returned with the big clasped sketch-book that the Nilghai knew well and\ndid not love too much. In it Dick had drawn all manner of moving incidents,\nexperienced by himself or related to him by the others, of all the four corners\nof the earth. But the wider range of the Nilghai's body and life\nattracted him most. When truth failed he fell back on fiction of the wildest,\nand represented incidents in the Nilghai's career that were\nunseemly, -- his marriages with many African princesses, his shameless\nbetrayal, for Arab wives, of an army corps to the Mahdi, his tattooment by\nskilled operators in Burmah, his interview (and his fears) with the yellow\nheadsman in the blood-stained execution-ground of Canton, and finally, the\npassings of his spirit into the bodies of whales, elephants, and toucans.\nTorpenhow from time to time had added rhymed descriptions, and the whole was a\ncurious piece of art, because Dick decided, having regard to the name of the\nbook which being interpreted means \"naked,\" that it would be wrong\nto draw the Nilghai with any clothes on, under any circumstances. Consequently\nthe last sketch, representing that much-enduring man calling on the War Office\nto press his claims to the Egyptian medal, was hardly delicate. He settled\nhimself comfortably on Torpenhow's table and turned over the pages.",
                "\"What a fortune you would have been to Blake, Nilghai!\" he said.\n\"There's a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches\nthat's more than life-like. \"The Nilghai surrounded while bathing\nby the Mahdieh\" -- that was founded on fact, eh?\"",

I was\nloafing from Lima to Auckland in a big, old, condemned passenger-ship turned\ninto a cargo-boat and owned by a second-had Italian firm. She was a crazy\nbasket. We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day, and we thought ourselves\nlucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her.

I hadn't anything\nto do for weeks. The ship's charts were in pieces and our skipper\ndaren't run south for fear of catching a storm. So he did his best to\nknock all the Society Islands out of the water one by one, and I went into the\nlower deck, and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as I\ncould go.

Then he smote him in the ribs, \"Now don't\nyou see it? Bessie's abject futility, and the terror in her eyes, welded\non to one or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my\nexperience lately.

                "The girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned, afraid and overbold by\nturns. When she found that she was merely expected to sit still, she grew\ncalmer, and criticised the appointments of the studio with freedom and some\npoint. She liked the warmth and the comfort and the release from fear of\nphysical pain. Dick made two or three studies of her head in monochrome, but\nthe actual notion of the Melancolia would not arrive.",
                "\"What a mess you keep your things in!\" said Bessie, some days\nlater, when she felt herself thoroughly at home. \"I s'pose your\nclothes are just as bad.",

                "Bessie made diligent inquiry in the latter's room, and unearthed a bale\nof disreputable socks. \"Some of these I'll mend now,\" she\nsaid, \"and some I'll take home.

I don't have any\nunnecessary words, but I put 'em down quick, I can tell you, when they\ntalk to me. No; it's quite nice these days. I lock my door, and they can\nonly call me names through the keyhole, and I sit inside, just like a lady,\nmending socks. Mr. Torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once.\"",
                "\"Three quid a week from me, and the delights of my society. No socks\nmended. Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again, and all\nhis socks mended. Bessie is very much a woman,\" thought Dick; and he\nlooked at her between half-shut eyes. Food and rest had transformed the girl,\nas Dick knew they would.",
                "\"What are you looking at me like that for?\" she said quickly.\n\"Don't. You look reg'lar bad when you look that way. You\ndon't think much o' me, do you?\"",
                "\"That depends on how you behave.\"",
                "Bessie behaved beautifully. Only it was difficult at the end of a sitting to\nbid her go out into the gray streets. She very much preferred the studio and a\nbig chair by the stove, with some socks in her lap as an excuse for delay. Then\nTorpenhow would come in, and Bessie would be moved to tell strange and\nwonderful stories of her past, and still stranger ones of her present improved\ncircumstances. She would make them tea as though she had a right to make it;\nand once or twice on these occasions Dick caught Torpenhow's eyes fixed\non the trim little figure, and because Bessie's flittings about the room\nmade Dick ardently long for Maisie, he realised whither Torpenhow's\nthoughts were tending. And Bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of\nTorpenhow's linen. She spoke very little to him, but sometimes they\ntalked together on the landing.",
                "\"I was a great fool,\" Dick said to himself. \"I know what red\nfirelight looks like when a man's tramping through a strange town; and\nours is a lonely, selfish sort of life at the best. I wonder Maisie\ndoesn't feel that sometimes. But I can't order Bessie away.\nThat's the worst of beginning things. One never knows where they\nstop.\"",
                "One evening, after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light, Dick was\nroused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhow's room. He jumped to his\nfeet. \"Now what ought I to do? It looks foolish to go in. -- Oh, bless\nyou, Binkie!\" The little terrier thrust Torpenhow's door open with\nhis nose and came out to take possession of Dick's chair. The door swung\nwide unheeded, and Dick across the landing could see Bessie in the half-light\nmaking her little supplication to Torpenhow. She was kneeling by his side, and\nher hands were clasped across his knee.",
                "\"I know, -- I know,\" she said thickly.\n\"'Tisn't right o' me to do this, but I can't help\nit; and you were so kind, -- so kind; and you never took any notice o'\nme.

                "But you -- couldn't you take and live with me till Miss Right comes\nalong? I'm only Miss Wrong, I know, but I'd work my hands to the\nbare bone for you. And I'm not ugly to look at. Say you will!\"",
                "Dick hardly recognised Torpenhow's voice in reply -- \"But look\nhere. It's no use. I'm liable to be ordered off anywhere at a\nminute's notice if a war breaks out. At a minute's\nnotice -- dear.\"",
                "\"What does that matter? Until you go, then. Until you go.\n'Tisn't much I'm asking, and -- you don't know how\ngood I can cook.\" She had put an arm round his neck and was drawing his\nhead down.",
                "\"Until -- I -- go, then.\"",
                "\"Torp,\" said Dick, across the landing. He could hardly steady his\nvoice.",
                "\"Come here a minute, old man. I'm in\ntrouble' -- \"Heaven send he'll listen to me!\" There\nwas something very like an oath from Bessie's lips. She was afraid of\nDick, and disappeared down the staircase in panic, but it seemed an age before\nTorpenhow entered the studio. He went to the mantelpiece, buried his head on\nhis arms, and groaned like a wounded bull.",
                "\"What the devil right have you to interfere?\" he said, at last.",
                "\"Who's interfering with which? Your own sense told you long ago you\ncouldn't be such a fool. It was a tough rack, St. Anthony, but\nyou're all right now.\"",

                "\"Now you talk sense. It does. But, since you aren't in a condition\nto discuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping, do you know what\nyou're going to do?\"",

                "\"You're going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone.\nYou're going to Brighton, or Scarborough, or Prawle Point, to see the\nships go by. And you're going at once.

                "But Torpenhow was in the south of England, inspecting dockyards in the company\nof the Nilghai. His letters were brief and full of mystery.",
                "Dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows. He argued,\nin the loneliness of his studio, henceforward to be decorated with a film of\ngray gauze in one corner, that, if his fate were blindness, all the Torpenhows\nin the world could not save him. \"I can't call him off his trip to\nsit down and sympathise with me. I must pull through this business\nalone,\" he said. He was lying on the sofa, eating his moustache and\nwondering what the darkness of the night would be like. Then came to his mind\nthe memory of a quaint scene in the Soudan. A soldier had been nearly hacked in\ntwo by a broad-bladed Arab spear. For one instant the man felt no pain. Looking\ndown, he saw that his life-blood was going from him. The stupid bewilderment on\nhis face was so intensely comic that both Dick and Torpenhow, still panting and\nunstrung from a fight for life, had roared with laughter, in which the man\nseemed as if he would join, but, as his lips parted in a sheepish grin, the\nagony of death came upon him, and he pitched grunting at their feet. Dick\nlaughed again, remembering the horror. It seemed so exactly like his own case.",
                "\"But I have a little more time allowed me,\" he said. He paced up\nand down the room, quietly at first, but afterwards with the hurried feet of\nfear. It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go\nforward; and there were only weaving circles and floating pin-dots before his\neyes.",
                "\"We need to be calm, Binkie; we must be calm.\" He talked aloud for\nthe sake of distraction. \"This isn't nice at all. What shall we do?\nWe must do something. Our time is short. I shouldn't have believed that\nthis morning; but now things are different. Binkie, where was Moses when the\nlight went out?\"",
                "Binkie smiled from ear to ear, as a well-bred terrier should, but made no\nsuggestion.",
                "\"\"Were there but world enough and time, This coyness, Binkie, were\nnot crime.... But at my back I always hear --  -- \"' He wiped\nhis forehead, which was unpleasantly damp. \"What can I do? What can I do?\nI haven't any notions left, and I can't think connectedly, but I\nmust do something, or I shall go off my head.\"",
                "The hurried walk recommenced, Dick stopping every now and again to drag forth\nlong-neglected canvases and old note-books; for he turned to his work by\ninstinct, as a thing that could not fail. \"You won't do, and you\nwon't do,\" he said, at each inspection. \"No more soldiers. I\ncouldn't paint 'em. Sudden death comes home too nearly, and this is\nbattle and murder for me.\"",
                "The day was failing, and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight of the\nblind had come upon him unaware. \"Allah Almighty!\" he cried\ndespairingly, \"help me through the time of waiting, and I won't\nwhine when my punishment comes. What can I do now, before the light\ngoes?\"",
                "There was no answer. Dick waited till he could regain some sort of control over\nhimself. His hands were shaking, and he prided himself on their steadiness; he\ncould feel that his lips were quivering, and the sweat was running down his\nface. He was lashed by fear, driven forward by the desire to get to work at\nonce and accomplish something, and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do\nmore than repeat the news that he was about to go blind. \"It's a\nhumiliating exhibition,\" he thought, \"and I'm glad Torp\nisn't here to see. The doctor said I was to avoid mental worry.",
                "Come here and let me pet you, Binkie.\"",
                "The little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him.",
                "Then he heard the man speaking in the twilight, and, doglike, understood that\nhis trouble stood off from him -- \"Allah is good, Binkie. Not quite so\ngentle as we could wish, but we'll discuss that later. I think I see my\nway to it now. All those studies of Bessie's head were nonsense, and they\nnearly brought your master into a scrape. I hold the notion now as clear as\ncrystal, -- \"the Melancolia that transcends all wit.\" There\nshall be Maisie in that head, because I shall never get Maisie; and Bess, of\ncourse, because she knows all about Melancolia, though she doesn't know\nshe knows; and there shall be some drawing in it, and it shall all end up with\na laugh. That's for myself. Shall she giggle or grin? No, she shall laugh\nright out of the canvas, and every man and woman that ever had a sorrow of\ntheir own shall -- what is it the poem says? --",
                "\"Understand the speech and feel a stir\nOf fellowship in all disastrous fight.",
                "\"In all disastrous fight\"? That's better than painting the\nthing merely to pique Maisie. I can do it now because I have it inside me.\nBinkie, I'm going to hold you up by your tail. You're an omen. Come\nhere.\"",
                "Binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking.",
                "\"Rather like holding a guinea-pig; but you're a brave little dog,\nand you don't yelp when you're hung up. It is an omen.\"",
                "Binkie went to his own chair, and as often as he looked saw Dick walking up and\ndown, rubbing his hands and chuckling. That night Dick wrote a letter to Maisie\nfull of the tenderest regard for her health, but saying very little about his\nown, and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born. Not till morning did he remember\nthat something might happen to him in the future.",
                "He fell to work, whistling softly, and was swallowed up in the clean, clear joy\nof creation, which does not come to man too often, lest he should consider\nhimself the equal of his God, and so refuse to die at the appointed time. He\nforgot Maisie, Torpenhow, and Binkie at his feet, but remembered to stir\nBessie, who needed very little stirring, into a tremendous rage, that he might\nwatch the smouldering lights in her eyes.",
                "He threw himself without reservation into his work, and did not think of the\ndoom that was to overtake him, for he was possessed with his notion, and the\nthings of this world had no power upon him.",
                "\"You're pleased to-day,\" said Bessie.",
                "Dick waved his mahl-stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for a\ndrink. In the evening, when the exaltation of the day had died down, he went to\nthe sideboard again, and after some visits became convinced that the eye-doctor\nwas a liar, since he could still see everything very clearly.",
                "He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie, and that whether\nshe liked it or not she should be his wife. The mood passed next morning, but\nthe sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort.",
                "Again he set to work, and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and blurs\ntill he had taken counsel with the sideboard, and the Melancolia both on the\ncanvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever. There was a delightful\nsense of irresponsibility upon him, such as they feel who walking among their\nfellow-men know that the death-sentence of disease is upon them, and, seeing\nthat fear is but waste of the little time left, are riotously happy. The days\npassed without event.",
                "Bessie arrived punctually always, and, though her voice seemed to Dick to come\nfrom a distance, her face was always very near. The Melancolia began to flame\non the canvas, in the likeness of a woman who had known all the sorrow in the\nworld and was laughing at it. It was true that the corners of the studio draped\nthemselves in gray film and retired into the darkness, that the spots in his\neyes and the pains across his head were very troublesome, and that\nMaisie's letters were hard to read and harder still to answer. He could\nnot tell her of his trouble, and he could not laugh at her accounts of her own\nMelancolia which was always going to be finished. But the furious days of toil\nand the nights of wild dreams made amends for all, and the sideboard was his\nbest friend on earth.",
                "Bessie was singularly dull. She used to shriek with rage when Dick stared at\nher between half-closed eyes. Now she sulked, or watched him with disgust,\nsaying very little.",
                "Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks. An incoherent note heralded his\nreturn. \"News! great news!\" he wrote. \"The Nilghai knows, and\nso does the Keneu. We're all back on Thursday. Get lunch and clean your\naccoutrements.\"",
                "Dick showed Bessie the letter, and she abused him for that he had ever sent\nTorpenhow away and ruined her life.",
                "\"Well,\" said Dick, brutally, \"you're better as you are,\ninstead of making love to some drunken beast in the street.\" He felt that\nhe had rescued Torpenhow from great temptation.",
                "\"I don't know if that's any worse than sitting to a drunken\nbeast in a studio. You haven't been sober for three weeks.\nYou've been soaking the whole time; and yet you pretend you're\nbetter than me!\"",
                "\"What d'you mean?\" said Dick.",
                "\"Mean! You'll see when Mr. Torpenhow comes back.\"",
                "It was not long to wait. Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a sign\nof feeling. He had news that was more to him than many Bessies, and the Keneu\nand the Nilghai were trampling behind him, calling for Dick.",
                "\"Drinking like a fish,\" Bessie whispered. \"He's been at\nit for nearly a month.\" She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment\ndone.",
                "They came into the studio, rejoicing, to be welcomed over effusively by a\ndrawn, lined, shrunken, haggard wreck, -- unshaven, blue-white about the\nnostrils, stooping in the shoulders, and peering under his eyebrows nervously.\nThe drink had been at work as steadily as Dick.",
                "\"Is this you?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"All that's left of me. Sit down. Binkie's quite well, and\nI've been doing some good work.\" He reeled where he stood.",
                "\"You've done some of the worst work you've ever done in your\nlife. Man alive, you're --  -- \"",
                "Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly, and they left the room to find\nlunch elsewhere. Then he spoke; but, since the reproof of a friend is much too\nsacred and intimate a thing to be printed, and since Torpenhow used figures and\nmetaphors which were unseemly, and contempt untranslatable, it will never be\nknown what was actually said to Dick, who blinked and winked and picked at his\nhands. After a time the culprit began to feel the need of a little\nself-respect. He was quite sure that he had not in any way departed from\nvirtue, and there were reasons, too, of which Torpenhow knew nothing. He would\nexplain.",
                "He rose, tried to straighten his shoulders, and spoke to the face he could\nhardly see.",
                "\"You are right,\" he said. \"But I am right, too. After you\nwent away I had some trouble with my eyes. So I went to an oculist, and he\nturned a gasogene -- I mean a gas-engine -- into my eye. That was very\nlong ago. He said, \"Scar on the head, -- sword-cut and optic\nnerve.\" Make a note of that. So I am going blind. I have some work to do\nbefore I go blind, and I suppose that I must do it. I cannot see much now, but\nI can see best when I am drunk. I did not know I was drunk till I was told, but\nI must go on with my work. If you want to see it, there it is.\" He\npointed to the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause.",
                "Torpenhow said nothing, and Dick began to whimper feebly, for joy at seeing\nTorpenhow again, for grief at misdeeds -- if indeed they were\nmisdeeds -- that made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic, and for childish\nvanity hurt, since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his wonderful\npicture.",
                "Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause, and saw the two walking\nup and down as usual, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's shoulder.",
                "Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie, who was\ndribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master again.",

Bessie faithfully tidied\nup the studio, set the door ajar for flight, emptied half a bottle of\nturpentine on a duster, and began to scrub the face of the Melancolia\nviciously. The paint did not smudge quickly enough. She took a palette-knife\nand scraped, following each stroke with the wet duster. In five minutes the\npicture was a formless, scarred muddle of colours. She threw the paint-stained\nduster into the studio stove, stuck out her tongue at the sleeper, and\nwhispered, \"Bilked!\" as she turned to run down the staircase. She\nwould never see Torpenhow any more, but she had at least done harm to the man\nwho had come between her and her desire and who used to make fun of her.\nCashing the check was the very cream of the jest to Bessie. Then the little\nprivateer sailed across the Thames, to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness\nof South-the-Water.",

                "As he repassed through the studio, Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the\npicture, and almost betrayed himself by outcries: \"Wiped\nout! -- scraped out and turped out! He's on the verge of jumps as it\nis. That's Bess, -- the little fiend! Only a woman could have done\nthat!-with the ink not dry on the check, too! Dick will be raving mad\nto-morrow.

He had just discovered that he was\npainting the face of the Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with millions of\nlights, and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet\nbelow his tiny swinging plank, shouting together in his honour, when something\ncracked inside his temples like an overstrained bowstring, the glittering dome\nbroke inward, and he was alone in the thick night.",

                "\"That's good. Now don't talk. If I keep very quiet for a\nwhile, this darkness will lift. It seems just on the point of breaking.\nH'sh!\" Dick knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him.\nThe night air was chilling Torpenhow's toes.",
                "\"Can you stay like that a minute?\" he said. \"I'll get\nmy dressing-gown and some slippers.\"",
                "Dick clutched the bed-head with both hands and waited for the darkness to clear\naway. \"What a time you've been!\" he cried, when Torpenhow\nreturned. \"It's as black as ever. What are you banging about in the\ndoor-way?\"",
                "\"Long chair, -- horse-blanket, -- pillow. Going to sleep by you.\nLie down now; you'll be better in the morning.\"",
                "\"I shan't!\" The voice rose to a wail. \"My God!\nI'm blind! I'm blind, and the darkness will never go away.\"\nHe made as if to leap from the bed, but Torpenhow's arms were round him,\nand Torpenhow's chin was on his shoulder, and his breath was squeezed out\nof him. He could only gasp, \"Blind!\" and wriggle feebly.",
                "\"Steady, Dickie, steady!\" said the deep voice in his ear, and the\ngrip tightened. \"Bite on the bullet, old man, and don't let them\nthink you're afraid,\" The grip could draw no closer. Both men were\nbreathing heavily.",
                "Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned.",
                "\"Let me go,\" he panted. \"You're cracking my ribs. We-we\nmustn't let them think we're afraid, must we, -- all the powers\nof darkness and that lot?\"",
                "\"Lie down. It's all over now.\"",
                "\"Yes,\" said Dick, obediently. \"But would you mind letting me\nhold your hand? I feel as if I wanted something to hold on to. One drops\nthrough the dark so.\"",
                "Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair. Dick clutched\nit tightly, and in half an hour had fallen asleep. Torpenhow withdrew his hand,\nand, stooping over Dick, kissed him lightly on the forehead, as men do\nsometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death, to ease his departure.",
                "In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself. He was adrift on the\nshoreless tides of delirium, speaking very quickly -- \"It's a\npity, -- a great pity; but it's helped, and it must be eaten, Master\nGeorge. Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof, and, further, putting\naside all Melancolias and false humours, it is of obvious notoriety -- such\nas mine was -- that the queen can do no wrong. Torp doesn't know that.\nI'll tell him when we're a little farther into the desert.",
                "What a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamer-ropes! They'll have\nthat four-inch hawser chafed through in a minute. I told you so -- there she\ngoes! White foam on green water, and the steamer slewing round. How good that\nlooks! I'll sketch it. No, I can't. I'm afflicted with\nophthalmia. That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt, and it extends up the\nNile in the shape of cataract. Ha! that's a joke, Torp. Laugh, you graven\nimage, and stand clear of the hawser.... It'll knock you into the water\nand make your dress all dirty, Maisie dear.\"",
                "\"Oh!\" said Torpenhow. \"This happened before. That night on\nthe river.\"",
                "\"She'll be sure to say it's my fault if you get muddy, and\nyou're quite near enough to the breakwater. Maisie, that's not\nfair. Ah! I knew you'd miss.",
                "Low and to the left, dear. But you've no conviction. Don't be\nangry, darling. I'd cut my hand off if it would give you anything more\nthan obstinacy. My right hand, if it would serve.\"",
                "\"Now we mustn't listen. Here's an island shouting across seas\nof misunderstanding with a vengeance. But it's shouting truth, I\nfancy,\" said Torpenhow.",
                "The babble continued. It all bore upon Maisie. Sometimes Dick lectured at\nlength on his craft, then he cursed himself for his folly in being enslaved. He\npleaded to Maisie for a kiss -- only one kiss -- before she went away,\nand called to her to come back from Vitry-sur-Marne, if she would; but through\nall his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that the queen could do no\nwrong.",
                "Torpenhow listened attentively, and learned every detail of Dick's life\nthat had been hidden from him. For three days Dick raved through the past, and\nthen a natural sleep. \"What a strain he has been running under, poor\nchap!\" said Torpenhow. \"Dick, of all men, handing himself over like\na dog! And I was lecturing him on arrogance! I ought to have known that it was\nno use to judge a man. But I did it. What a demon that girl must be!\nDick's given her his life, -- confound him! -- and she's\ngiven him one kiss apparently.\"",
                "\"Torp,\" said Dick, from the bed, \"go out for a walk.\nYou've been here too long. I'll get up. Hi! This is annoying. I\ncan't dress myself. Oh, it's too absurd!\"",
                "Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the\nstudio. He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to lift.\nIt did not lift that day, nor the next. Dick adventured on a voyage round the\nwalls. He hit his shins against the stove, and this suggested to him that it\nwould be better to crawl on all fours, one hand in front of him. Torpenhow\nfound him on the floor.",
                "\"I'm trying to get the geography of my new possessions,\" said\nhe. \"D'you remember that nigger you gouged in the square? Pity you\ndidn't keep the odd eye. It would have been useful. Any letters for me?\nGive me all the ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside.\nThey're of no importance.\"",
                "Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M. on the envelope flap. Dick put it\ninto his pocket. There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might not have read,\nbut it belonged to himself and to Maisie, who would never belong to him.",
                "\"When she finds that I don't write, she'll stop writing.\nIt's better so. I couldn't be any use to her now,\" Dick\nargued, and the tempter suggested that he should make known his condition.\nEvery nerve in him revolted. \"I have fallen low enough already. I'm\nnot going to beg for pity. Besides, it would be cruel to her.\" He strove\nto put Maisie out of his thoughts; but the blind have many opportunities for\nthinking, and as the tides of his strength came back to him in the long\nemployless days of dead darkness, Dick's soul was troubled to the core.\nAnother letter, and another, came from Maisie. Then there was silence, and Dick\nsat by the window, the pulse of summer in the air, and pictured her being won\nby another man, stronger than himself. His imagination, the keener for the dark\nbackground it worked against, spared him no single detail that might send him\nraging up and down the studio, to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in\nfour places at once. Worst of all, tobacco would not taste in the darkness. The\narrogance of the man had disappeared, and in its place were settled despair\nthat Torpenhow knew, and blind passion that Dick confided to his pillow at\nnight. The intervals between the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting\nand the weight of intolerable darkness.",
                "\"Come out into the Park,\" said Torpenhow. \"You haven't\nstirred out since the beginning of things.\"",
                "\"What's the use? There's no movement in the dark; and,\nbesides,\" -- he paused irresolutely at the head of the\nstairs, -- \"something will run over me.\"",
                "\"Not if I'm with you. Proceed gingerly.\"",
                "The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror, and he clung to\nTorpenhow's arm. \"Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your\nfoot!\" he said petulantly, as he turned into the Park. \"Let's\ncurse God and die.\"",
                "\"Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments. By Jove, there\nare the Guards!\"",
                "Dick's figure straightened. \"Let's get near 'em.\nLet's go in and look. Let's get on the grass and run. I can smell\nthe trees.\"",
                "\"Mind the low railing. That's all right!\" Torpenhow kicked\nout a tuft of grass with his heel. \"Smell that,\" he said.\n\"Isn't it good?\" Dick sniffed luxuriously. \"Now pick up\nyour feet and run.\" They approached as near to the regiment as was\npossible. The clank of bayonets being unfixed made Dick's nostrils\nquiver.",
                "\"Let's get nearer. They're in column, aren't\nthey?\"",
                "\"Yes. How did you know?\"",
                "\"Felt it. Oh, my men! -- my beautiful men!\" He edged forward as\nthough he could see. \"I could draw those chaps once. Who'll draw\n'em now?\"",
                "\"They'll move off in a minute. Don't jump when the band\nbegins.\"",
                "\"Huh! I'm not a new charger. It's the silences that hurt.\nNearer, Torp! -- nearer! Oh, my God, what wouldn't I give to see\n'em for a minute! -- one half-minute!\"",
                "He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him, could hear the slings\ntighten across the bandsman's chest as he heaved the big drum from the\nground.",
                "\"Sticks crossed above his head,\" whispered Torpenhow.",
                "\"I know. I know! Who should know if I don't?\nH'sh!\"",
                "The drum-sticks fell with a boom, and the men swung forward to the crash of the\nband. Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face, heard the\nmaddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts. The big\ndrum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall refrain that made a perfect\nquickstep --",
                "He must be a man of decent height,\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0He must be a man of weight,\nHe must come home on a Saturday night\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0In a thoroughly sober state;\nHe must know how to love me,\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And he must know how to kiss;\nAnd if he's enough to keep us both\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0I can't refuse him bliss.",

He could never read them for\nhimself as long as life endured; but Maisie might have sent him some fresh ones\nto play with. The Nilghai entered with a gift, -- a piece of red\nmodelling-wax.

He had long since ceased to think about the work he had done in\nthe old days, and the desire to do more work had departed from him. He was\nexceedingly sorry for himself, and the completeness of his tender grief soothed\nhim. But his soul and his body cried for Maisie -- Maisie who would\nunderstand. His mind pointed out that Maisie, having her own work to do, would\nnot care. His experience had taught him that when money was exhausted women\nwent away, and that when a man was knocked out of the race the others trampled\non him. \"Then at the least,\" said Dick, in reply, \"she could\nuse me as I used Binat, -- for some sort of a study.

Everybody spoke at once, discussing press\ncensorships, railway-routes, transport, water-supply, the capacities of\ngenerals, -- these in language that would have horrified a trusting\npublic, -- ranging, asserting, denouncing, and laughing at the top of their\nvoices. There was the glorious certainty of war in the Soudan at any moment.\nThe Nilghai said so, and it was well to be in readiness. The Keneu had\ntelegraphed to Cairo for horses; Cassavetti had stolen a perfectly inaccurate\nlist of troops that would be ordered forward, and was reading it out amid\nprofane interruptions, and the Keneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who\nwould be employed as war artist by the Central Southern Syndicate.\n\"It's his first outing,\" said the Keneu. \"Give him some\ntips -- about riding camels.\"",
                "\"Oh, those camels!\" groaned Cassavetti. \"I shall learn to\nride him again, and now I am so much all soft! Listen, you good fellows. I know\nyour military arrangement very well. There will go the Royal Argalshire\nSutherlanders. So it was read to me upon best authority.\"",
                "A roar of laughter interrupted him.",
                "\"Sit down,\" said the Nilghai. \"The lists aren't even\nmade out in the War Office.\"",
                "\"Will there be any force at Suakin?\" said a voice.",
                "Then the outcries redoubled, and grew mixed, thus: \"How many Egyptian\ntroops will they use? -- God help the Fellaheen! -- There's a\nrailway in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fives-court. -- We shall have\nthe Suakin-Berber line built at last. -- Canadian voyageurs are too careful.\nGive me a half-drunk Krooman in a whale-boat. -- Who commands the Desert\ncolumn? -- No, they never blew up the big rock in the Ghineh bend. We shall\nhave to be hauled up, as usual. -- Somebody tell me if there's an\nIndian contingent, or I'll break everybody's\nhead. -- Don't tear the map in two. -- It's a war of\noccupation, I tell you, to connect with the African companies in the\nSouth. -- There's Guinea-worm in most of the wells on that\nroute.\" Then the Nilghai, despairing of peace, bellowed like a fog-horn\nand beat upon the table with both hands.",
                "\"But what becomes of Torpenhow?\" said Dick, in the silence that\nfollowed.",
                "\"Torp's in abeyance just now. He's off love-making somewhere,\nI suppose,\" said the Nilghai.",
                "\"He said he was going to stay at home,\" said the Keneu.",
                "\"Is he?\" said Dick, with an oath. \"He won't. I'm\nnot much good now, but if you and the Nilghai hold him down I'll engage\nto trample on him till he sees reason. He'll stay behind, indeed!\nHe's the best of you all. There'll be some tough work by Omdurman.\nWe shall come there to stay, this time.",
                "But I forgot. I wish I were going with you.\"",
                "\"So do we all, Dickie,\" said the Keneu.",
                "\"And I most of all,\" said the new artist of the Central Southern\nSyndicate.",

                "Maisie put her elbows on the window-sill and looked at the moonlight on the\nstraight, poplar-flanked road. Summer had come upon Vitry-sur-Marne and parched\nit to the bone. The grass was dry-burnt in the meadows, the clay by the bank of\nthe river was caked to brick, the roadside flowers were long since dead, and\nthe roses in the garden hung withered on their stalks. The heat in the little\nlow bedroom under the eaves was almost intolerable. The very moonlight on the\nwall of Kami's studio across the road seemed to make the night hotter,\nand the shadow of the big bell-handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky\nblack that caught Maisie's eye and annoyed her.",
                "\"Horrid thing! It should be all white,\" she murmured. \"And\nthe gate isn't in the middle of the wall, either. I never noticed that\nbefore.\"",
                "Maisie was hard to please at that hour. First, the heat of the past few weeks\nhad worn her down; secondly, her work, and particularly the study of a female\nhead intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished in time for the\nSalon, was unsatisfactory; thirdly, Kami had said as much two days before;\nfourthly, -- but so completely fourthly that it was hardly worth thinking\nabout, -- Dick, her property, had not written to her for more than six\nweeks. She was angry with the heat, with Kami, and with her work, but she was\nexceedingly angry with Dick.",
                "She had written to him three times, -- each time proposing a fresh treatment\nof her Melancolia. Dick had taken no notice of these communications. She had\nresolved to write no more. When she returned to England in the autumn -- for\nher pride's sake she could not return earlier -- she would speak to\nhim. She missed the Sunday afternoon conferences more than she cared to admit.\nAll that Kami said was, \"Continuez, mademoiselle, continuez\ntoujours,\" and he had been repeating the wearisome counsel through\nthe hot summer, exactly like a cicada, -- an old gray cicada in a black\nalpaca coat, white trousers, and a huge felt hat. But Dick had tramped\nmasterfully up and down her little studio north of the cool green London park,\nand had said things ten times worse than continuez, before he snatched\nthe brush out of her hand and showed her where the error lay. His last letter,\nMaisie remembered, contained some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun\nor drinking water at wayside farmhouses; and he had said that not once, but\nthree times, -- as if he did not know that Maisie could take care of\nherself.",
                "But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write? A murmur of voices\nin the road made her lean from the window. A cavalryman of the little garrison\nin the town was talking to Kami's cook. The moonlight glittered on the\nscabbard of his sabre, which he was holding in his hand lest it should clank\ninopportunely. The cook's cap cast deep shadows on her face, which was\nclose to the conscript's. He slid his arm round her waist, and there\nfollowed the sound of a kiss.",
                "\"Faugh!\" said Maisie, stepping back.",
                "\"What's that?\" said the red-haired girl, who was tossing\nuneasily outside her bed.",
                "\"Only a conscript kissing the cook,\" said Maisie.",
                "\"They've gone away now.\" She leaned out of the window again,\nand put a shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills. There was a very\nsmall night-breeze abroad, and a sun-baked rose below nodded its head as one\nwho knew unutterable secrets. Was it possible that Dick should turn his\nthoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of Suzanne\nand the conscript? He could not! The rose nodded its head and one leaf\ntherewith. It looked like a naughty little devil scratching its ear.",
                "Dick could not, \"because,\" thought Maisie, \"he is\nmine, -- mine, -- mine. He said he was. I'm sure I don't care\nwhat he does. It will only spoil his work if he does; and it will spoil mine\ntoo.\"",
                "The rose continued to nod it the futile way peculiar to flowers. There was no\nearthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose, except that he\nwas called by Providence, which was Maisie, to assist Maisie in her work. And\nher work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes to English\nprovincial exhibitions, as the notices in the scrap-book proved, and that were\ninvariably rejected by the Salon when Kami was plagued into allowing her to\nsend them up. Her work in the future, it seemed, would be the preparation of\npictures on exactly similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same\nway --  -- The red-haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets.\n\"It's too hot to sleep,\" she moaned; and the interruption\njarred.",
                "Exactly the same way. Then she would divide her years between the little studio\nin England and Kami's big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No, she would go to\nanother master, who should force her into the success that was her right, if\npatient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to anything. Dick had\ntold her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft. She had worked\nten years, and ten years were nothing. Dick had said that ten years were\nnothing, -- but that was in regard to herself only. He had said -- this\nvery man who could not find time to write -- that he would wait ten years\nfor her, and that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later. He had\nsaid this in the absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria; and then he had\nstopped writing. He was wandering up and down moonlit streets, kissing cooks.\nShe would like to lecture him now, -- not in her nightgown, of course, but\nproperly dressed, severely and from a height. Yet if he was kissing other girls\nhe certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not. He would laugh at\nher. Very good.",
                "She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went, etc., etc.",
                "The mill-wheel of thought swung round slowly, that no section of it might be\nslurred over, and the red-haired girl tossed and turned behind her.",
                "Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt\nwhatever of the villainy of Dick. To justify herself, she began, unwomanly, to\nweigh the evidence. There was a boy, and he had said he loved her. And he\nkissed her, -- kissed her on the cheek, -- by a yellow sea-poppy that\nnodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in the garden. Then there\nwas an interval, and men had told her that they loved her -- just when she\nwas busiest with her work. Then the boy came back, and at their very second\nmeeting had told her that he loved her. Then he had --  --  But there was\nno end to the things he had done. He had given her his time and his powers. He\nhad spoken to her of Art, housekeeping, technique, teacups, the abuse of\npickles as a stimulant, -- that was rude, -- sable hair-brushes, -- he\nhad given her the best in her stock, -- she used them daily; he had given\nher advice that she profited by, and now and again -- a look. Such a look!\nThe look of a beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his\nmistress's feet. In return she had given him nothing whatever,\nexcept -- here she brushed her mouth against the open-work sleeve of her\nnightgown -- the privilege of kissing her once. And on the mouth, too.\nDisgraceful! Was that not enough, and more than enough? and if it was not, had\nhe not cancelled the debt by not writing and -- probably kissing other\ngirls? \"Maisie, you'll catch a chill. Do go and lie down,\"\nsaid the wearied voice of her companion. \"I can't sleep a wink with\nyou at the window.\"",
                "Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. She was reflecting on the\nmeannesses of Dick, and on other meannesses with which he had nothing to do.\nThe moonlight would not let her sleep. It lay on the skylight of the studio\nacross the road in cold silver; she stared at it intently and her thoughts\nbegan to slide one into the other. The shadow of the big bell-handle in the\nwall grew short, lengthened again, and faded out as the moon went down behind\nthe pasture and a hare came limping home across the road. Then the dawn-wind\nwashed through the upland grasses, and brought coolness with it, and the cattle\nlowed by the drought-shrunk river. Maisie's head fell forward on the\nwindow-sill, and the tangle of black hair covered her arms.",
                "\"Maisie, wake up. You'll catch a chill.\"",
                "\"Yes, dear; yes, dear.\" She staggered to her bed like a wearied\nchild, and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered, \"I\nthink -- I think....",
                "But he ought to have written.\"",
                "Day brought the routine of the studio, the smell of paint and turpentine, and\nthe monotone wisdom of Kami, who was a leaden artist, but a golden teacher if\nthe pupil were only in sympathy with him. Maisie was not in sympathy that day,\nand she waited impatiently for the end of the work. She knew when it was\ncoming; for Kami would gather his black alpaca coat into a bunch behind him,\nand, with faded blue eyes that saw neither pupils nor canvas, look back into\nthe past to recall the history of one Binat. \"You have all done not so\nbadly,\" he would say. \"But you shall remember that it is not enough\nto have the method, and the art, and the power, nor even that which is touch,\nbut you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall. Of the\nso many I taught,\" -- here the students would begin to unfix\ndrawing-pins or get their tubes together, -- \"the very so many that I\nhave taught, the best was Binat. All that comes of the study and the work and\nthe knowledge was to him even when he came. After he left me he should have\ndone all that could be done with the colour, the form, and the knowledge. Only,\nhe had not the conviction. So to-day I hear no more of Binat, -- the best of\nmy pupils, -- and that is long ago. So to-day, too, you will be glad to hear\nno more of me. Continuez, mesdemoiselles, and, above all, with\nconviction.\"",
                "He went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the pupils\ndispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to make plans for\nthe cool of the afternoon.",
                "Maisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia, restrained a desire to grimace\nbefore it, and was hurrying across the road to write a letter to Dick, when she\nwas aware of a large man on a white troop-horse. How Torpenhow had managed in\nthe course of twenty hours to find his way to the hearts of the cavalry\nofficers in quarters at Vitry-sur-Marne, to discuss with them the certainty of\na glorious revenge for France, to reduce the colonel to tears of pure\naffability, and to borrow the best horse in the squadron for the journey to\nKami's studio, is a mystery that only special correspondents can unravel.",
                "\"I beg your pardon,\" said he. \"It seems an absurd question to\nask, but the fact is that I don't know her by any other name: Is there\nany young lady here that is called Maisie?\"",
                "\"I am Maisie,\" was the answer from the depths of a great sun-hat.",
                "\"I ought to introduce myself,\" he said, as the horse capered in the\nblinding white dust. \"My name is Torpenhow. Dick Heldar is my best\nfriend, and -- and -- the fact is that he has gone blind.\"",
                "\"Blind!\" said Maisie, stupidly. \"He can't be\nblind.\"",
                "\"He has been stone-blind for nearly two months.\"",
                "Maisie lifted up her face, and it was pearly white. \"No! No! Not blind! I\nwon't have him blind!\"",
                "\"Would you care to see for yourself?\" said Torpenhow.",
                "\"Now, -- at once?\"",
                "\"Oh, no! The Paris train doesn't go through this place till\nto-night. There will be ample time.\"",
                "\"Did Mr. Heldar send you to me?\"",
                "\"Certainly not. Dick wouldn't do that sort of thing. He's\nsitting in his studio, turning over some letters that he can't read\nbecause he's blind.\"",
                "There was a sound of choking from the sun-hat. Maisie bowed her head and went\ninto the cottage, where the red-haired girl was on a sofa, complaining of a\nheadache.",
                "\"Dick's blind!\" said Maisie, taking her breath quickly as she\nsteadied herself against a chair-back. \"My Dick's blind!\"",
                "\"What?\" The girl was on the sofa no longer.",
                "\"A man has come from England to tell me. He hasn't written to me\nfor six weeks.\"",

                "Torpenhow's neck was blistering, but he preserved a smile of infinite\npatience as Maisie's appeared bareheaded in the sunshine.",
                "\"I am coming,\" said she, her eyes on the ground.",
                "\"You will be at Vitry Station, then, at seven this evening.\" This\nwas an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed. Maisie said\nnothing, but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing with this\nbig man who took everything for granted and managed a squealing horse with one\nhand. She returned to the red-haired girl, who was weeping bitterly, and\nbetween tears, kisses, -- very few of those, -- menthol, packing, and an\ninterview with Kami, the sultry afternoon wore away.",
                "Thought might come afterwards. Her present duty was to go to Dick, -- Dick\nwho owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her unopened\nletters.",
                "\"But what will you do,\" she said to her companion.",
                "\"I? Oh, I shall stay here and -- finish your Melancolia,\" she\nsaid, smiling pitifully. \"Write to me afterwards.\"",
                "That night there ran a legend through Vitry-sur-Marne of a mad Englishman,\ndoubtless suffering from sunstroke, who had drunk all the officers of the\ngarrison under the table, had borrowed a horse from the lines, and had then and\nthere eloped, after the English custom, with one of those more mad English\ngirls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good Monsieur Kami.",
                "\"They are very droll,\" said Suzanne to the conscript in the\nmoonlight by the studio wall. \"She walked always with those big eyes that\nsaw nothing, and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister,\nand gives me -- see -- ten francs!\"",
                "The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts; for he prided himself on\nbeing a good soldier.",
                "Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais; but he was\ncareful to attend to all her wants, to get her a compartment entirely to\nherself, and to leave her alone. He was amazed of the ease with which the\nmatter had been accomplished.",
                "\"The safest thing would be to let her think things out. By Dick's\nshowing, -- when he was off his head, -- she must have ordered him about\nvery thoroughly. Wonder how she likes being under orders.\"",
                "Maisie never told. She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes shut,\nthat she might realise the sensation of blindness. It was an order that she\nshould return to London swiftly, and she found herself at last almost beginning\nto enjoy the situation. This was better than looking after luggage and a\nred-haired friend who never took any interest in her surroundings. But there\nappeared to be a feeling in the air that she, Maisie, -- of all\npeople, -- was in disgrace. Therefore she justified her conduct to herself\nwith great success, till Torpenhow came up to her on the steamer and without\npreface began to tell the story of Dick's blindness, suppressing a few\ndetails, but dwelling at length on the miseries of delirium. He stopped before\nhe reached the end, as though he had lost interest in the subject, and went\nforward to smoke. Maisie was furious with him and with herself.",
                "She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for\nbreakfast, and -- she was past any feeling of indignation now -- was\nbidden curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead-covered stairs while\nTorpenhow went up to make inquiries. Again the knowledge that she was being\ntreated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame. It was all\nDick's fault for being so stupid as to go blind.",
                "Torpenhow led her up to a shut door, which he opened very softly. Dick was\nsitting by the window, with his chin on his chest. There were three envelopes\nin his hand, and he turned them over and over. The big man who gave orders was\nno longer by her side, and the studio door snapped behind her.",
                "Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound. \"Hullo,\nTorp! Is that you? I've been so lonely.\"",
                "His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed herself\nup into a corner of the room. Her heart was beating furiously, and she put one\nhand on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring directly at her, and she\nrealised for the first time that he was blind.",
                "Shutting her eyes in a rail-way carriage to open them when she pleased was\nchild's play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.",
                "\"Torp, is that you? They said you were coming.\" Dick looked puzzled\nand a little irritated at the silence.",
                "\"No; it's only me,\" was the answer, in a strained little\nwhisper. Maisie could hardly move her lips.",
                "\"H'm!\" said Dick, composedly, without moving. \"This is\na new phenomenon. Darkness I'm getting used to; but I object to hearing\nvoices.\"",
                "Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself? Maisie's\nheart beat more wildly, and she breathed in gasps. Dick rose and began to feel\nhis way across the room, touching each table and chair as he passed. Once he\ncaught his foot on a rug, and swore, dropping on his knees to feel what the\nobstruction might be. Maisie remembered him walking in the Park as though all\nthe earth belonged to him, tramping up and down her studio two months ago, and\nflying up the gangway of the Channel steamer. The beating of her heart was\nmaking her sick, and Dick was coming nearer, guided by the sound of her\nbreathing. She put out a hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to\nherself, she did not know which. It touched his chest, and he stepped back as\nthough he had been shot.",
                "\"It's Maisie!\" said he, with a dry sob. \"What are you\ndoing here?\"",
                "\"I came -- I came -- to see you, please.\"",
                "Dick's lips closed firmly.",

                "\"Why, what has happened? Can I do anything for you? No, I can't. I\nforgot.\"",
                "\"Oh, Dick, I'm so sorry! I've come to tell you,\nand --  --  Let me take you back to your chair.\"",
                "\"Don't! I'm not a child. You only do that out of pity. I\nnever meant to tell you anything about it. I'm no good now. I'm\ndown and done for. Let me alone!\"",
                "He groped back to his chair, his chest labouring as he sat down.",
                "Maisie watched him, and the fear went out of her heart, to be followed by a\nvery bitter shame. He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl\nthrough every step of the impetuous flight to London; for he was, indeed, down\nand done for -- masterful no longer but rather a little abject; neither an\nartist stronger than she, nor a man to be looked up to -- only some blind\none that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of crying. She was immensely\nand unfeignedly sorry for him -- more sorry than she had ever been for any\none in her life, but not sorry enough to deny his words.",
                "So she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt, because she had honestly\nintended that her journey should end triumphantly; and now she was only filled\nwith pity most startlingly distinct from love.",
                "\"Well?\" said Dick, his face steadily turned away. \"I never\nmeant to worry you any more. What's the matter?\"",
                "He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as unprepared as\nherself for the torrent of emotion that followed. She had dropped into a chair\nand was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.",
                "\"I can't -- I can't!\" she cried desperately.\n\"Indeed, I can't. It isn't my fault.",
                "I'm so sorry. Oh, Dickie, I'm so sorry.\"",
                "Dick's shoulders straightened again, for the words lashed like a whip.",
                "Still the sobbing continued. It is not good to realise that you have failed in\nthe hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of making sacrifices.",
                "\"I do despise myself -- indeed I do. But I can't. Oh, Dickie,\nyou wouldn't ask me -- would you?\" wailed Maisie.",
                "She looked up for a minute, and by chance it happened that Dick's eyes\nfell on hers. The unshaven face was very white and set, and the lips were\ntrying to force themselves into a smile. But it was the worn-out eyes that\nMaisie feared. Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place some one that she\ncould hardly recognise till he spoke.",
                "\"Who is asking you to do anything, Maisie? I told you how it would be.",
                "What's the use of worrying? For pity's sake don't cry like\nthat; it isn't worth it.\"",
                "\"You don't know how I hate myself. Oh, Dick, help me -- help\nme!\" The passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning\nto alarm the man. He stumbled forward and put his arm round her, and her head\nfell on his shoulder.",
                "\"Hush, dear, hush! Don't cry. You're quite right, and\nyou've nothing to reproach yourself with -- you never had.\nYou're only a little upset by the journey, and I don't suppose\nyou've had any breakfast. What a brute Torp was to bring you over.\"",
                "\"I wanted to come. I did indeed,\" she protested.",
                "\"Very well. And now you've come and seen, and\nI'm -- immensely grateful.",
                "When you're better you shall go away and get something to eat. What sort\nof a passage did you have coming over?\"",
                "Maisie was crying more subduedly, for the first time in her life glad that she\nhad something to lean against. Dick patted her on the shoulder tenderly but\nclumsily, for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be.",
                "She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited, trembling and most\nunhappy. He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room between\nthem, and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart.",
                "\"Are you better now?\" he said.",
                "\"Yes, but -- don't you hate me?\"",
                "\"I hate you? My God! I?\"",
                "\"Isn't -- isn't there anything I could do for you, then?\nI'll stay here in England to do it, if you like. Perhaps I could come and\nsee you sometimes.\"",
                "\"I think not, dear. It would be kindest not to see me any more, please. I\ndon't want to seem rude, but -- don't you think -- perhaps\nyou had almost better go now.\"",
                "He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain\ncontinued much longer.",
                "\"I don't deserve anything else. I'll go, Dick. Oh, I'm\nso miserable.\"",
                "\"Nonsense. You've nothing to worry about; I'd tell you if you\nhad. Wait a moment, dear. I've got something to give you first. I meant\nit for you ever since this little trouble began. It's my Melancolia; she\nwas a beauty when I last saw her. You can keep her for me, and if ever\nyou're poor you can sell her. She's worth a few hundreds at any\nstate of the market.\" He groped among his canvases. \"She's\nframed in black. Is this a black frame that I have my hand on? There she is.\nWhat do you think of her?\"",
                "He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, and the eyes\nstrained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One thing and one\nthing only could she do for him.",
                "\"Well?\"",
                "The voice was fuller and more rounded, because the man knew he was speaking of\nhis best work. Maisie looked at the blur, and a lunatic desire to laugh caught\nher by the throat. But for Dick's sake -- whatever this mad blankness\nmight mean -- she must make no sign. Her voice choked with hard-held tears\nas she answered, still gazing at the wreck --",
                "\"Oh, Dick, it is good!\"",
                "He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute. \"Won't\nyou have it, then? I'll send it over to your house if you will.\"",
                "\"I? Oh yes -- thank you. Ha! ha!\" If she did not fly at once the\nlaughter that was worse than tears would kill her. She turned and ran, choking\nand blinded, down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge in a\ncab and go to her house across the Parks. There she sat down in the dismantled\ndrawing-room and thought of Dick in his blindness, useless till the end of\nlife, and of herself in her own eyes. Behind the sorrow, the shame, and the\nhumiliation, lay fear of the cold wrath of the red-haired girl when Maisie\nshould return. Maisie had never feared her companion before. Not until she\nfound herself saying, \"Well, he never asked me,\" did she realise\nher scorn of herself.",
                "And that is the end of Maisie.",
                "For Dick was reserved more searching torment. He could not realise at first\nthat Maisie, whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell.\nHe was savagely angry against Torpenhow, who had brought upon him this\nhumiliation and troubled his miserable peace. Then his dark hour came and he\nwas alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the\ndarkness. The queen could do no wrong, but in following the right, so far as it\nserved her work, she had wounded her one subject more than his own brain would\nlet him know.",
                "\"It's all I had and I've lost it,\" he said, as soon as\nthe misery permitted clear thinking. \"And Torp will think that he has\nbeen so infernally clever that I shan't have the heart to tell him. I\nmust think this out quietly.\"",
                "\"Hullo!\" said Torpenhow, entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed\ntwo hours of thought. \"I'm back. Are you feeling any better?\"",
                "\"Torp, I don't know what to say. Come here.\" Dick coughed\nhuskily, wondering, indeed, what he should say, and how to say it temperately.",
                "\"What's the need for saying anything? Get up and tramp.\"\nTorpenhow was perfectly satisfied.",
                "They walked up and down as of custom, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's\nshoulder, and Dick buried in his own thoughts.",
                "\"How in the world did you find it all out?\" said Dick, at last.",
                "\"You shouldn't go off your head if you want to keep secrets,\nDickie. It was absolutely impertinent on my part; but if you'd seen me\nrocketing about on a half-trained French troop-horse under a blazing sun\nyou'd have laughed. There will be a charivari in my rooms to-night. Seven\nother devils --  -- \"",

                "\"Would you have stayed with me, then, if -- things had gone\nwrong?\" He put his question cautiously.",

                "That night there was a tumult on the stairs. The correspondents poured in from\ntheatre, dinner, and music-hall to Torpenhow's room that they might\ndiscuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations becoming a\ncertainty. Torpenhow, the Keneu, and the Nilghai had bidden all the men they\nhad worked with to the orgy; and Mr. Beeton, the housekeeper, declared that\nnever before in his checkered experience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of\ngentlemen. They waked the chambers with shoutings and song; and the elder men\nwere quite as bad as the younger. For the chances of war were in front of them,\nand all knew what those meant.",
                "Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the landing,\nDick suddenly began to laugh to himself.",
                "\"When one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic.\nMaisie's quite right -- poor little thing. I didn't know she\ncould cry like that before; but now I know what Torp thinks, I'm sure\nhe'd be quite fool enough to stay at home and try to console me -- if\nhe knew. Besides, it isn't nice to own that you've been thrown over\nlike a broken chair. I must carry this business through alone -- as usual.\nIf there isn't a war, and Torp finds out, I shall look foolish,\nthat's all. If there is a way I mustn't interfere with another\nman's chances. Business is business, and I want to be alone -- I want\nto be alone. What a row they're making!\"",
                "Somebody hammered at the studio door.",

                "\"I should like to, but I can't. I'm not feeling\nfrolicsome.\"",
                "\"Then, I'll tell the boys and they'll drag you like a\nbadger.\"",

He had helped to sing the choruses; but scarcely inside the\nstudio he realised that this was no place for tail-wagging, and settled himself\non Dick's lap till it was bedtime. Then he went to bed with Dick, who\ncounted every hour as it struck, and rose in the morning with a painfully clear\nhead to receive Torpenhow's more formal congratulations and a particular\naccount of the last night's revels.",
                "\"You aren't looking very happy for a newly accepted man,\"\nsaid Torpenhow.",

You likes soft-roe bloater, don't you? Soft-roe\nbloaters is scarcer than hard-roe, but what I says is, \"Never mind a\nlittle extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the\ntenants.\"'",
                "Mr. Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself. Torpenhow had been long away;\nthere was no more rioting in the chambers, and Dick had settled down to his new\nlife, which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than death.",
                "It is hard to live alone in the dark, confusing the day and night; dropping to\nsleep through sheer weariness at mid-day, and rising restless in the chill of\nthe dawn. At first Dick, on his awakenings, would grope along the corridors of\nthe chambers till he heard some one snore. Then he would know that the day had\nnot yet come, and return wearily to his bedroom.",
                "Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the house\nand Mr. Beeton advised him to get up. Once dressed -- and dressing, now that\nTorpenhow was away, was a lengthy business, because collars, ties, and the like\nhid themselves in far corners of the room, and search meant head-beating\nagainst chairs and trunks -- once dressed, there was nothing whatever to do\nexcept to sit still and brood till the three daily meals came. Centuries\nseparated breakfast from lunch and lunch from dinner, and though a man prayed\nfor hundreds of years that his mind might be taken from him, God would never\nhear. Rather the mind was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against\neach other as millstones grind when there is no corn between; and yet the brain\nwould not wear out and give him rest. It continued to think, at length, with\nimagery and all manner of reminiscences. It recalled Maisie and past success,\nreckless travels by land and sea, the glory of doing work and feeling that it\nwas good, and suggested all that might have happened had the eyes only been\nfaithful to their duty. When thinking ceased through sheer weariness, there\npoured into Dick's soul tide on tide of overwhelming, purposeless\nfear -- dread of starvation always, terror lest the unseen ceiling should\ncrush down upon him, fear of fire in the chambers and a louse's death in\nred flame, and agonies of fiercer horror that had nothing to do with any fear\nof death. Then Dick bowed his head, and clutching the arms of his chair fought\nwith his sweating self till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat\nwas being set before him.",
                "Mr. Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare, and Dick learned to\nhang upon his speech, which dealt with badly fitted gas-plugs, waste-pipes out\nof repair, little tricks for driving picture-nails into walls, and the sins of\nthe charwoman or the housemaids. In the lack of better things the small gossip\nof a servant'' hall becomes immensely interesting, and the screwing\nof a washer on a tap an event to be talked over for days.",
                "Once or twice a week, too, Mr. Beeton would take Dick out with him when he went\nmarketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish, lamp-wicks,\nmustard, tapioca, and so forth, while Dick rested his weight first on one foot\nand then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins and string-ball on the\ncounter. Then they would perhaps meet one of Mr. Beeton's friends, and\nDick, standing aside a little, would hold his peace till Mr. Beeton was willing\nto go on again.",
                "The life did not increase his self-respect. He abandoned shaving as a dangerous\nexercise, and being shaved in a barber's shop meant exposure of his\ninfirmity. He could not see that his clothes were properly brushed, and since\nhe had never taken any care of his personal appearance he became every known\nvariety of sloven. A blind man cannot deal with cleanliness till he has been\nsome months used to the darkness. If he demand attendance and grow angry at the\nwant of it, he must assert himself and stand upright. Then the meanest menial\ncan see that he is blind and, therefore, of no consequence. A wise man will\nkeep his eyes on the floor and sit still. For amusement he may pick coal lump\nby lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the\nfender, keeping count of the lumps, which must all be put back again, one by\none and very carefully. He may set himself sums if he cares to work them out;\nhe may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him; and if his\ntrade has been that of an artist, he may sketch in the air with his forefinger;\nbut that is too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut. He may go to his\nbookshelves and count his books, ranging them in order of their size; or to his\nwardrobe and count his shirts, laying them in piles of two or three on the bed,\nas they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons.",

                "\"He's best left to hisself -- gentlemen always are when\nthey're downhearted,\" said Mr. Beeton.",
                "Alf's rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhow's\nspecial correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear,\nthrough the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind\nthe soldiers outside Suakin; could hear the men swearing and chaffing across\nthe cooking pots, and could smell the acrid wood-smoke as it drifted over camp\nbefore the wind of the desert.",
                "That night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him, offering for\nproof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he had not shot himself\nlong ago. That prayer was not answered, and indeed Dick knew in his heart of\nhearts that only a lingering sense of humour and no special virtue had kept him\nalive. Suicide, he had persuaded himself, would be a ludicrous insult to the\ngravity of the situation as well as a weak-kneed confession of fear.",
                "\"Just for the fun of the thing,\" he said to the cat, who had taken\nBinkie's place in his establishment, \"I should like to know how\nlong this is going to last. I can live for a year on the hundred pounds Torp\ncashed for me. I must have two or three thousand at least in the\nBank -- twenty or thirty years more provided for, that is to say. Then I\nfall back on my hundred and twenty a year, which will be more by that time.\nLet's consider.",
                "Twenty-five -- thirty-five -- a man's in his prime then, they\nsay -- forty-five -- a middle-aged man just entering\npolitics -- fifty-five -- \"died at the comparatively early age of\nfifty-five,\" according to the newspapers. Bah! How these Christians funk\ndeath! Sixty-five -- we're only getting on in years. Seventy-five is\njust possible, though. Great hell, cat O! fifty years more of solitary\nconfinement in the dark! You'll die, and Beeton will die, and Torp will\ndie, and Mai -- everybody else will die, but I shall be alive and kicking\nwith nothing to do. I'm very sorry for myself. I should like some one\nelse to be sorry for me. Evidently I'm not going mad before I die, but\nthe pain's just as bad as ever. Some day when you're vivisected,\ncat O! they'll tie you down on a little table and cut you open -- but\ndon't be afraid; they'll take precious good care that you\ndon't die. You'll live, and you'll be very sorry then that\nyou weren't sorry for me. Perhaps Torp will come back or... I wish I\ncould go to Torp and the Nilghai, even though I were in their way.\"",
                "Pussy left the room before the speech was ended, and Alf, as he entered, found\nDick addressing the empty hearth-rug.",
                "\"There's a letter for you, sir,\" he said. \"Perhaps\nyou'd like me to read it.\"",
                "\"Lend it to me for a minute and I'll tell you.\"",
                "The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not over-steady. It\nwas within the limits of human possibility that -- that was no letter from\nMaisie. He knew the heft of three closed envelopes only too well. It was a\nfoolish hope that the girl should write to him, for he did not realise that\nthere is a wrong which admits of no reparation though the evildoer may with\ntears and the heart's best love strive to mend all. It is best to forget\nthat wrong whether it be caused or endured, since it is as remediless as bad\nwork once put forward.",
                "\"Read it, then,\" said Dick, and Alf began intoning according to the\nrules of the Board School --",
                "\"'I could have given you love, I could have given you loyalty,\nsuch as you never dreamed of. Do you suppose I cared what you were? But you\nchose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing. My only excuse for you\nis that you are so young.'",
                "\"That's all,\" he said, returning the paper to be dropped into\nthe fire.",
                "\"What was in the letter?\" asked Mrs. Beeton, when Alf returned.",
                "\"I don't know. I think it was a circular or a tract about not\nwhistlin' at everything when you're young.\"",
                "\"I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and\nit has bounced up and hit me. God help it, whatever it is -- unless it was\nall a joke. But I don't know any one who'd take the trouble to play\na joke on me.... Love and loyalty for nothing. It sounds tempting enough.",
                "I wonder whether I have lost anything really?\"",
                "Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had put\nhimself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman's hands.",
                "Still, the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think about\nstung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night. When his heart\nwas so full of despair that it would hold no more, body and soul together\nseemed to be dropping without check through the darkness.",
                "Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light again. But\nthere was no light to be reached. When that agony had left him sweating and\nbreathless, the downward flight would recommence till the gathering torture of\nit spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the first. Followed some few\nminutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw. Then the procession of events\nwould repeat itself till he was utterly worn out and the brain took up its\neverlasting consideration of Maisie and might-have-beens.",
                "At the end of everything Mr. Beeton came to his room and volunteered to take\nhim out. \"Not marketing this time, but we'll go into the Parks if\nyou like.\"",
                "\"Be damned if I do,\" quoth Dick. \"Keep to the streets and\nwalk up and down. I like to hear the people round me.\"",
                "This was not altogether true. The blind in the first stages of their infirmity\ndislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted arms -- but Dick\nhad no earthly desire to go to the Parks. Once and only once since Maisie had\nshut her door he had gone there under Alf's charge. Alf forgot him and\nfished for minnows in the Serpentine with some companions. After half an\nhour's waiting Dick, almost weeping with rage and wrath, caught a\npasser-by, who introduced him to a friendly policeman, who led him to a\nfour-wheeler opposite the Albert Hall. He never told Mr. Beeton of Alf's\nforgetfulness, but... this was not the manner in which he was used to walk the\nParks aforetime.",
                "\"What streets would you like to walk down, then?\" said Mr. Beeton,\nsympathetically. His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on the\ngrass of Green Park with his family, and half a dozen paper bags full of food.",
                "\"Keep to the river,\" said Dick, and they kept to the river, and the\nrush of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck\nthence on to the Waterloo Road, Mr. Beeton explaining the beauties of the\nscenery as he went on.",
                "\"And walking on the other side of the pavement,\" said he,\n\"unless I'm much mistaken, is the young woman that used to come to\nyour rooms to be drawed. I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name,\nexcept paying tenants, o' course!\"",
                "\"Stop her,\" said Dick. \"It's Bessie Broke. Tell her\nI'd like to speak to her again. Quick, man!\"",
                "Mr. Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested\nBessie then on her way northward. She recognised him as the man in authority\nwho used to glare at her when she passed up Dick's staircase, and her\nfirst impulse was to run.",
                "\"Wasn't you Mr. Heldar's model?\" said Mr. Beeton,\nplanting himself in front of her. \"You was. He's on the other side\nof the road and he'd like to see you.\"",
                "\"Why?\" said Bessie, faintly. She remembered -- indeed had never\nfor long forgotten -- an affair connected with a newly finished picture.",
                "\"Because he has asked me to do so, and because he's most particular\nblind.\"",
                "\"Drunk?\"",
                "\"No. 'Orspital blind. He can't see. That's him over\nthere.\"",
                "Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr. Beeton pointed him\nout -- a stub-bearded, bowed creature wearing a dirty magenta-coloured\nneckcloth outside an unbrushed coat. There was nothing to fear from such an\none. Even if he chased her, Bessie thought, he could not follow far. She\ncrossed over, and Dick's face lighted up. It was long since a woman of\nany kind had taken the trouble to speak to him.",
                "\"I hope you're well, Mr. Heldar?\" said Bessie, a little\npuzzled. Mr. Beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed\nresponsibly.",
                "\"I'm very well indeed, and, by Jove! I'm glad to\nsee -- hear you, I mean, Bess. You never thought it worth while to turn up\nand see us again after you got your money. I don't know why you should.\nAre you going anywhere in particular just now?\"",
                "\"I was going for a walk,\" said Bessie.",
                "\"Not the old business?\" Dick spoke under his breath.",
                "\"Lor, no! I paid my premium' -- Bessie was very proud of that\nword -- \"for a barmaid, sleeping in, and I'm at the bar now\nquite respectable. Indeed I am.\"",
                "Mr. Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human nature.\nTherefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his gas-plugs\nwithout a word of apology. Bessie watched the flight with a certain uneasiness;\nbut so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the harm that had been done to\nhim...",
                "\"It's hard work pulling the beer-handles,\" she went on,\n\"and they've got one of them penny-in-the-slot cash-machines, so if\nyou get wrong by a penny at the end of the day -- but then I don't\nbelieve the machinery is right. Do you?\"",

                "\"It isn't taking you out of your way?\" he said hesitatingly.\n\"I can ask a policeman if it is.\"",
                "\"Not at all. I come on at seven and I'm off at four. That's\neasy hours.\"",
                "\"Good God! -- but I'm on all the time. I wish I had some work to\ndo too.",

                "He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk, recoiling with an oath.\nBessie took his arm and said nothing -- as she had said nothing when he had\nordered her to turn her face a little more to the light. They walked for some\ntime in silence, the girl steering him deftly through the crowd.",
                "\"And where's -- where's Mr. Torpenhow?\" she inquired\nat last.",
                "\"He has gone away to the desert.\"",

                "\"Then west, then south, and then east again, all along the under-side of\nEurope. Then south again, God knows how far.\" The explanation did not\nenlighten Bessie in the least, but she held her tongue and looked to\nDick's path till they came to the chambers.",
                "\"We'll have tea and muffins,\" he said joyously. \"I\ncan't tell you, Bessie, how glad I am to find you again. What made you go\naway so suddenly?\"",
                "\"I didn't think you'd want me any more,\" she said,\nemboldened by his ignorance.",
                "\"I didn't, as a matter of fact -- but afterwards -- At any\nrate I'm glad you've come. You know the stairs.\"",
                "So Bessie led him home to his own place -- there was no one to\nhinder -- and shut the door of the studio.",
                "\"What a mess!\" was her first word. \"All these things\nhaven't been looked after for months and months.\"",
                "\"No, only weeks, Bess. You can't expect them to care.\"",
                "\"I don't know what you expect them to do. They ought to know what\nyou've paid them for. The dust's just awful. It's all over\nthe easel.\"",
                "\"I don't use it much now.\"",
                "\"All over the pictures and the floor, and all over your coat. I'd\nlike to speak to them housemaids.\"",
                "\"Ring for tea, then.\" Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by\ncustom.",
                "Bessie saw the action and, as far as in her lay, was touched. But there\nremained always a keen sense of new-found superiority, and it was in her voice\nwhen she spoke.",
                "\"How long have you been like this?\" she said wrathfully, as though\nthe blindness were some fault of the housemaids.",
                "\"How?\"",
                "\"As you are.\"",
                "\"The day after you went away with the check, almost as soon as my picture\nwas finished; I hardly saw her alive.\"",

                "\"Tea and muffins,\" she said shortly, when the ring at the\nbell was answered; \"two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot. I\ndon't want the old teapot that was here when I used to come. It\ndon't draw. Get another.\"",
                "The housemaid went away scandalised, and Dick chuckled. Then he began to cough\nas Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust.",

                "\"Put things straight. This is like unfurnished lodgings. How could you\nlet it go so?\"",
                "\"How could I help it? Dust away.\"",

                "\"Muffins ready yet?\" said Bess, still dusting. She was no longer a\ndrab of the streets but a young lady who, thanks to Dick's check, had\npaid her premium and was entitled to pull beer-handles with the best. Being\nneatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face Mrs. Beeton, and there\npassed between the two women certain regards that Dick would have appreciated.\nThe situation adjusted itself by eye. Bessie had won, and Mrs. Beeton returned\nto cook muffins and make scathing remarks about models, hussies, trollops, and\nthe like, to her husband.",

They ain't no objects to\na blind man, of course, but if it was to come into court we'd get the\nsack. Yes, I did introduce him to that girl because I'm a feelin'\nman myself.\"",
                "\"Much too feelin'!\" Mrs. Beeton slapped the muffins into the\ndish, and thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion.",

                "\"I had no intention of doing such, I do assure you.\"",
                "Bessie made no answer whatever. This, she knew, was the way in which real\nladies routed their foes, and when one is a barmaid at a first-class\npublic-house one may become a real lady at ten minutes' notice.",
                "Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and displeased.\nThere were droppings of food all down the front of his coat; the mouth under\nthe ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the forehead was lined and\ncontracted; and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour\nthat might or might not have been called gray. The utter misery and\nself-abandonment of the man appealed to her, and at the bottom of her heart lay\nthe wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled\nher.",

                "\"Oh, I'm sorry for you. I'm that sorry for you!\" she\ncried impulsively, and took Dick's hands. Mechanically, he lowered his\nhead as if to kiss -- she was the only woman who had taken pity on him, and\nhe was not too proud for a little pity now. She stood up to go.",
                "\"Nothing o' that kind till you look more like a gentleman.\nIt's quite easy when you get shaved, and some clothes.\"",

It might be worth more\nthan the bar -- I wouldn't have to do any work -- and just as\nrespectable as if no one knew.\"",
                "Dick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift. He was acutely conscious\nof it in the nape of his neck throughout the night, but it seemed, among very\nmany other things, to enforce the wisdom of getting shaved.",
                "He was shaved accordingly in the morning, and felt the better for it. A fresh\nsuit of clothes, white linen, and the knowledge that some one in the world said\nthat she took an interest in his personal appearance made him carry himself\nalmost upright; for the brain was relieved for a while from thinking of Maisie,\nwho, under other circumstances, might have given that kiss and a million\nothers.",

With Bessie's return and certain\nnew prospects that had developed themselves, the Melancolia -- lovelier in\nhis imagination than she had ever been on canvas -- reappeared.

                "Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been\nintroduced to the head-steward, had royally tipped him, secured a good place at\ntable, opened out his baggage, and settled himself down with joy in the cabin.\nIt was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about, for he knew\neverything so well. Then God was very kind: a deep sleep of weariness came upon\nhim just as he would have thought of Maisie, and he slept till the steamer had\ncleared the mouth of the Thames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel.",
                "The rattle of the engines, the reek of oil and paint, and a very familiar sound\nin the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance.",
                "\"Oh, it's good to be alive again!\" He yawned, stretched\nhimself vigorously, and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast\nof the lights of Brighton. This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square is\na common; the free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less Dick could feel\nthe healing of the sea at work upon him already. A boisterous little\ncross-swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose; and one wave\nbreaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new deck-chairs. He\nheard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass, was stung in the face by a\ncupful, and sniffing luxuriously, felt his way to the smoking-room by the\nwheel. There a strong b reeze found him, blew his cap off and left him\nbareheaded in the doorway, and the smoking-room steward, understanding that he\nwas a voyager of experience, said that the weather would be stiff in the chops\noff the Channel and more than half a gale in the Bay. These things fell as they\nwere foretold, and Dick enjoyed himself to the utmost. It is allowable and even\nnecessary at sea to lay firm hold upon tables, stanchions, and ropes in moving\nfrom place to place. On land the man who feels with his hands is patently\nblind. At sea even a blind man who is not sea-sick can jest with the doctor\nover the weakness of his fellows. Dick told the doctor many tales -- and\nthese are coin of more value than silver if properly handled -- smoked with\nhim till unholy hours of the night, and so won his short-lived regard that he\npromised Dick a few hours of his time when they came to Port Said.",
                "And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew, and the engines sang their\nsong day and night, and the sun grew stronger day by day, and Tom the Lascar\nbarber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened hatch-grating where the cool\nwinds blew, and the awnings were spread and the passengers made merry, and at\nlast they came to Port Said.",
                "\"Take me,\" said Dick, to the doctor, \"to Madame\nBinat's -- if you know where that is.\"",
                "\"Whew!\" said the doctor, \"I do. There's not much to\nchoose between 'em; but I suppose you're aware that that's\none of the worst houses in the place. They'll rob you to begin with, and\nknife you later.\"",
                "\"Not they. Take me there, and I can look after myself.\"",
                "So he was brought to Madame Binat's and filled his nostrils with the\nwell-remembered smell of the East, that runs without a change from the Canal\nhead to Hong-Kong, and his mouth with the villainous Lingua Franca of the\nLevant. The heat smote him between the shoulder-blades with the buffet of an\nold friend, his feet slipped on the sand, and his coat-sleeve was warm as\nnew-baked bread when he lifted it to his nose.",
                "Madame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick entered\nthe drinking-shop which was one source of her gains. But for a little accident\nof complete darkness he could hardly realise that he had ever quitted the old\nlife that hummed in his ears. Somebody opened a bottle of peculiarly strong\nSchiedam. The smell reminded Dick of Monsieur Binat, who, by the way, had\nspoken of art and degradation.",
                "Binat was dead; Madame said as much when the doctor departed, scandalised, so\nfar as a ship's doctor can be, at the warmth of Dick's reception.\nDick was delighted at it. \"They remember me here after a year. They have\nforgotten me across the water by this time. Madame, I want a long talk with you\nwhen you're at liberty. It is good to be back again.\"",
                "In the evening she set an iron-topped caf\u00c3\u00a9-table out on the sands, and Dick and\nshe sat by it, while the house behind them filled with riot, merriment, oaths,\nand threats. The stars came out and the lights of the shipping in the harbour\ntwinkled by the head of the Canal.",
                "\"Yes. The war is good for trade, my friend; but what dost thou do here?\nWe have not forgotten thee.\"",
                "\"I was over there in England and I went blind.\"",
                "\"But there was the glory first. We heard of it here, even here -- I\nand Binat; and thou hast used the head of Yellow \"Tina -- she is still\nalive -- so often and so well that \"Tina laughed when the papers\narrived by the mail-boats. It was always something that we here could recognise\nin the paintings. And then there was always the glory and the money for\nthee.\"",
                "\"I am not poor -- I shall pay you well.\"",
                "\"Not to me. Thou hast paid for everything.\" Under her breath,\n\"Mon Dieu, to be blind and so young! What horror!\"",
                "Dick could not see her face with the pity on it, or his own with the\ndiscoloured hair at the temples. He did not feel the need of pity; he was too\nanxious to get to the front once more, and explained his desire.",
                "\"And where? The Canal is full of the English ships. Sometimes they fire\nas they used to do when the war was here -- ten years ago. Beyond Cairo\nthere is fighting, but how canst thou go there without a correspondent's\npassport? And in the desert there is always fighting, but that is impossible\nalso,\" said she.",
                "\"I must go to Suakin.\" He knew, thanks to Alf's readings,\nthat Torpenhow was at work with the column that was protecting the construction\nof the Suakin-Berber line. P. and O. steamers do not touch at that port, and,\nbesides, Madame Binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth anything.\nThey were not respectable folk, but they could cause things to be accomplished,\nwhich is much more important when there is work toward.",
                "\"But at Suakin they are always fighting. That desert breeds men\nalways -- and always more men. And they are so bold! Why to Suakin?\"",
                "\"My friend is there.",
                "\"Thy friend! Chtt! Thy friend is death, then.\"",
                "Madame Binat dropped a fat arm on the table-top, filled Dick's glass\nanew, and looked at him closely under the stars. There was no need that he\nshould bow his head in assent and say -- \"No. He is a man,\nbut -- if it should arrive... blamest thou?\"",
                "\"I blame?\" she laughed shrilly. \"Who am I that I should blame\nany one -- except those who try to cheat me over their consommations. But it\nis very terrible.\"",
                "\"I must go to Suakin. Think for me. A great deal has changed within the\nyear, and the men I knew are not here. The Egyptian lighthouse steamer goes\ndown the Canal to Suakin -- and the post-boats -- But even\nthen --  -- \"",
                "\"Do not think any longer. I know, and it is for me to think. Thou\nshalt go -- thou shalt go and see thy friend. Be wise. Sit here until the\nhouse is a little quiet -- I must attend to my guests -- and afterwards\ngo to bed. Thou shalt go, in truth, thou shalt go.\"",
                "\"To-morrow?\"",
                "\"As soon as may be.\" She was talking as though he were a child.",
                "He sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the streets, and\nwondering how soon the end would come, till Madame Binat carried him off to bed\nand ordered him to sleep. The house shouted and sang and danced and revelled,\nMadame Binat moving through it with one eye on the liquor payments and the\ngirls and the other on Dick's interests. To this latter end she smiled\nupon scowling and furtive Turkish officers of fellaheen regiments, was gracious\nto Cypriote commissariat underlings, and more than kind to camel agents of no\nnationality whatever.",
                "In the early morning, being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red silk\nball-dress, with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a necklace of\nplate-glass diamonds, she made chocolate and carried it in to Dick.",
                "\"It is only I, and I am of discreet age, eh? Drink and eat the roll too.\nThus in France mothers bring their sons, when those behave wisely, the morning\nchocolate.\" She sat down on the side of the bed\nwhispering: -- \"It is all arranged. Thou wilt go by the lighthouse\nboat. That is a bribe of ten pounds English. The captain is never paid by the\nGovernment. The boat comes to Suakin in four days. There will go with thee\nGeorge, a Greek muleteer. Another bribe of ten pounds. I will pay; they must\nnot know of thy money. George will go with thee as far as he goes with his\nmules. Then he comes back to me, for his well-beloved is here, and if I do not\nreceive a telegram from Suakin saying that thou art well, the girl answers for\nGeorge.\"",
                "\"Thank you.\" He reached out sleepily for the cup. \"You are\nmuch too kind, Madame.\"",
                "\"If there were anything that I might do I would say, stay here and be\nwise; but I do not think that would be best for thee.\" She looked at her\nliquor-stained dress with a sad smile. \"Nay, thou shalt go, in truth,\nthou shalt go. It is best so. My boy, it is best so.\"",
                "She stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes. \"That is for\ngood-morning,\" she said, going away. \"When thou art dressed we will\nspeak to George and make everything ready. But first we must open the little\ntrunk. Give me the keys.\"",
                "\"The amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous. I shall expect\nTorp to kiss me next. He is more likely to swear at me for getting in his way,\nthough. Well, it won't last long. -- Ohe, Madame, help me to my\ntoilette of the guillotine! There will be no chance of dressing properly out\nyonder.\"",
                "He was rummaging among his new campaign-kit, and rowelling his hands with the\nspurs. There are two ways of wearing well-oiled ankle-jacks, spotless blue\nbands, khaki coat and breeches, and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet. The\nright way is the way of the untired man, master of himself, setting out upon an\nexpedition, well pleased.",
                "\"Everything must be very correct,\" Dick explained. \"It will\nbecome dirty afterwards, but now it is good to feel well dressed. Is everything\nas it should be?\"",
                "He patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on the\nright hip and fingered his collar.",

                "Take me there.\"",
                "In spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse\nboat began to move. Madame had said a great deal both to George and the captain\ntouching the arrangements that were to be made for Dick's benefit. Very\nfew men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard\nMadame's advice. That sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a\nstranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation.",
                "For six days -- two of them were wasted in the crowded Canal -- the\nlittle steamer worked her way to Suakin, where she was to pick up the\nsuperintendent of the lighthouse; and Dick made it his business to propitiate\nGeorge, who was distracted with fears for the safety of his light-of-love and\nhalf inclined to make Dick responsible for his own discomfort. When they\narrived George took him under his wing, and together they entered the red-hot\nseaport, encumbered with the material and wastage of the Suakin-Berger line,\nfrom locomotives in disconsolate fragments to mounds of chairs and\npot-sleepers.",

                "\"Ah! Base camp. I see. That's a better business than fighting\nFuzzies in the open.\"",

                "\"The dears -- they always used to!\" Dick snuffed the smell of\nparched dust, heated iron, and flaking paint with delight. Certainly the old\nlife was welcoming him back most generously.",

                "\"I have no chance,\" said the Greek. \"She is there with\nthat woman.\"",

                "They went to the telegraph-office unquestioned, for all the world was\ndesperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head, and Suakin was the\nlast place under sky that would be chosen for holiday-ground. On their return\nthe voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was doing. The blue\ngoggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on George's elbow\nas he replied -- \"Egyptian Government -- mules. My orders are to\ngive them over to the A. C. G. at Tanai-el-Hassan. Any occasion to show my\npapers?\"",

                "\"I go out in the train to-night, I suppose,\" said Dick, boldly.\n\"There will be no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?\"",

You must have them loaded up\nearly.\" The young man went away wondering what sort of broken-down waif\nthis might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek muleteers.\nDick felt unhappy. To outface an English officer is no small thing, but the\nbluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark, and stumbles up and\ndown rough ways, thinking and eternally thinking of what might have been if\nthings had fallen out otherwise, and all had been as it was not.",

In those days he could\nsee -- few men more clearly -- and the spectacle of an armed camp at\ndinner under the stars was an ever fresh pleasure to the eye. There was colour,\nlight, and motion, without which no man has much pleasure in living. This night\nthere remained for him only one more journey through the darkness that never\nlifts to tell a man how far he has travelled. Then he would grip\nTorpenhow's hand again -- Torpenhow, who was alive and strong, and\nlived in the midst of the action that had once made the reputation of a man\ncalled Dick Heldar: not in the least to be confused with the blind, bewildered\nvagabond who seemed to answer to the same name. Yes, he would find Torpenhow,\nand come as near to the old life as might be. Afterwards he would forget\neverything: Bessie, who had wrecked the Melancolia and so nearly wrecked his\nlife; Beeton, who lived in a strange unreal city full of tin-tacks and\ngas-plugs and matters that no men needed; that irrational being who had offered\nhim love and loyalty for nothing, but had not signed her name; and most of all\nMaisie, who, from her own point of view, was undeniably right in all she did,\nbut oh, at this distance, so tantalisingly fair.",
                "George's hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation.",
                "\"And what now?\" said George.",
                "\"Oh yes of course. What now? Take me to the camel-men. Take me to where\nthe scouts sit when they come in from the desert. They sit by their camels, and\nthe camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners, and the men\neat by their side just like camels. Take me there!\"",
                "The camp was rough and rutty, and Dick stumbled many times over the stumps of\nscrub. The scouts were sitting by their beasts, as Dick knew they would. The\nlight of the dung-fires flickered on their bearded faces, and the camels\nbubbled and mumbled beside them at rest. It was no part of Dick's policy\nto go into the desert with a convoy of supplies. That would lead to impertinent\nquestions, and since a blind non-combatant is not needed at the front, he would\nprobably be forced to return to Suakin.",
                "He must go up alone, and go immediately.",
                "\"Now for one last bluff -- the biggest of all,\" he said.\n\"Peace be with you, brethren!\" The watchful George steered him to\nthe circle of the nearest fire. The heads of the camel-sheiks bowed gravely,\nand the camels, scenting a European, looked sideways curiously like brooding\nhens, half ready to get to their feet.",
                "\"A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line to-night,\" said\nDick.",
                "\"A Mulaid?\" said a voice, scornfully naming the best baggage-breed\nthat he knew.",
                "\"A Bisharin,\" returned Dick, with perfect gravity. \"A\nBisharin without saddle-galls. Therefore no charge of thine, shock-head.\"",
                "Two or three minutes passed. Then -- \"We be knee-haltered for the\nnight. There is no going out from the camp.\"",
                "\"Not for money?\"",
                "\"H'm! Ah! English money?\"",
                "Another depressing interval of silence.",
                "\"How much?\"",
                "\"Twenty-five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my\njourney's end, and as much more into the hand of the camel-sheik here, to\nbe paid when the driver returns.\"",
                "This was royal payment, and the sheik, who knew that he would get his\ncommission on this deposit, stirred in Dick's behalf.",
                "\"For scarcely one night's journey -- fifty pounds. Land and\nwells and good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days.\nWho speaks?\" said Dick.",
                "\"I,\" said a voice. \"I will go -- but there is no going\nfrom the camp.\"",
                "\"Fool! I know that a camel can break his knee-halter, and the sentries do\nnot fire if one goes in chase. Twenty-five pounds and another twenty-five\npounds. But the beast must be a good Bisharin; I will take no\nbaggage-camel.\"",
                "Then the bargaining began, and at the end of half an hour the first deposit was\npaid over to the sheik, who talked in low tones to the driver.",
                "Dick heard the latter say: \"A little way out only. Any baggage-beast will\nserve. Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man?\"",
                "\"And though I cannot see' -- Dick lifted his voice a\nlittle -- \"yet I carry that which has six eyes, and the driver will\nsit before me. If we do not reach the English troops in the dawn he will be\ndead.\"",
                "\"But where, in God's name, are the troops?\"",
                "\"Unless thou knowest let another man ride. Dost thou know? Remember it\nwill be life or death to thee.\"",
                "\"I know,\" said the driver, sullenly. \"Stand back from my\nbeast. I am going to slip him.\"",
                "\"Not so swiftly. George, hold the camel's head a moment. I want to\nfeel his cheek.\" The hands wandered over the hide till they found the\nbranded half-circle that is the mark of the Biharin, the light-built\nriding-camel.",
                "\"That is well. Cut this one loose. Remember no blessing of God comes on\nthose who try to cheat the blind.\"",
                "The men chuckled by the fires at the camel-driver's discomfiture. He had\nintended to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt.",
                "\"Stand back!\" one shouted, lashing the Biharin under the belly with\na quirt. Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose-string tighten in his\nhand, -- and a cry went up, \"Illaha! Aho! He is loose.\"",
                "With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward toward\nthe desert, his driver following with shouts and lamentation.",
                "George caught Dick's arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a\ndisgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels.",
                "\"What's the row now?\" he cried.",
                "\"Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary,\" Dick answered,\nafter the manner of a common soldier.",
                "\"Go on, and take care your throat's not cut outside -- you and\nyour dromedary's.\"",
                "The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock, and his\ndriver had called him back and made him kneel down.",
                "\"Mount first,\" said Dick. Then climbing into the second seat and\ngently screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion's back,\n\"Go on in God's name, and swiftly. Good-bye, George. Remember me to\nMadame, and have a good time with your girl. Get forward, child of the\nPit!\"",
                "A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence, hardly broken by the\ncreaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet. Dick adjusted\nhimself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace, girthed his belt\ntighter, and felt the darkness slide past. For an hour he was conscious only of\nthe sense of rapid progress.",
                "\"A good camel,\" he said at last.",
                "\"He was never underfed. He is my own and clean bred,\" the driver\nreplied.",
                "\"Go on.\"",
                "His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think, but the tenor of his\nthoughts was broken because he was very sleepy. In the half doze it seemed that\nhe was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs. Jennett's. He had committed\nsome crime as bad as Sabbath-breaking, and she had locked him up in his\nbedroom. But he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the\nhymn --",
                "When Israel of the Lord beloved\nOut of the land of bondage came.",
                "He said them over and over thousands of times. The driver turned in the saddle\nto see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and ending the ride.\nDick roused, struck him over the head with the butt, and stormed himself wide\nawake. Somebody hidden in a clump of camel-thorn shouted as the camel toiled up\nrising ground. A shot was fired, and the silence shut down again, bringing the\ndesire to sleep. Dick could think no longer. He was too tired and stiff and\ncramped to do more than nod uneasily from time to time, waking with a start and\npunching the driver with the pistol.",
                "\"Is there a moon?\" he asked drowsily.",
                "\"She is near her setting.\"",
                "\"I wish that I could see her. Halt the camel. At least let me hear the\ndesert talk.\"",
                "The man obeyed. Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind. It rattled\nthe dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased. A handful of dry\nearth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and crumbled softly to the\nbottom.",
                "\"Go on. The night is very cold.\"",
                "Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the light\nlengthens itself into many eternities. It seemed to Dick that he had never\nsince the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save jolt through\nthe air. Once in a thousand years he would finger the nailheads on the\nsaddle-front and count them all carefully. Centuries later he would shift his\nrevolver from his right hand to his left and allow the eased arm to drop down\nat his side. From the safe distance of London he was watching himself thus\nemployed, -- watching critically. Yet whenever he put out his hand to the\ncanvas that he might paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the\nsinking moon, the black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop, that\nhand held a revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collar-bone.\nMoreover, he was in the dark, and could see no canvas of any kind whatever.",
                "The driver grunted, and Dick was conscious of a change in the air.",
                "\"I smell the dawn,\" he whispered.",
                "\"It is here, and yonder are the troops. Have I done well?\"",
                "The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the pungent\nreek of camels in the square.",
                "\"Go on. We must get there swiftly. Go on.\"",
                "\"They are moving in their camp. There is so much dust that I cannot see\nwhat they do.\"",
                "\"Am I in better case? Go forward.\"",
                "They could hear the hum of voices ahead, the howling and the bubbling of the\nbeasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day.",
                "Two or three shots were fired.",
                "\"Is that at us? Surely they can see that I am English,\" Dick spoke\nangrily.",
                "\"Nay, it is from the desert,\" the driver answered, cowering in his\nsaddle.",
                "\"Go forward, my child! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an\nhour ago.\"",
                "The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied. The\nchildren of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises, a\ndawn attack for the English troops, and were getting their distance by\nsnap-shots at the only moving object without the square.",
                "\"What luck! What stupendous and imperial luck!\" said Dick.\n\"It's \"just before the battle, mother.\" Oh, God has\nbeen most good to me!",
                "Only' -- the agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an\ninstant -- \"Maisie...\"",
                "\"Allahu! We are in,\" said the man, as he drove into the rearguard\nand the camel knelt.",
                "\"Who the deuce are you? Despatches or what? What's the strength of\nthe enemy behind that ridge? How did you get through?\" asked a dozen\nvoices. For all answer Dick took a long breath, unbuckled his belt, and shouted\nfrom the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice, \"Torpenhow! Ohe,\nTorp! Coo-ee, Tor-pen-how.\"",
                "A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved very\nswiftly towards that cry, as the rearguard, facing about, began to fire at the\npuffs of smoke from the hillocks around. Gradually the scattered white\ncloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white that hung heavily in the\nstillness of the dawn before they turned over wave-like and glided into the\nvalleys. The soldiers in the square were coughing and swearing as their own\nsmoke obstructed their view, and they edged forward to get beyond it. A wounded\ncamel leaped to its feet and roared aloud, the cry ending in a bubbling grunt.\nSome one had cut its throat to prevent confusion. Then came the thick sob of a\nman receiving his death-wound from a bullet; then a yell of agony and redoubled\nfiring.",
                "There was no time to ask any questions.",
                "\"Get down, man! Get down behind the camel!\"",
                "\"No. Put me, I pray, in the forefront of the battle.\" Dick turned\nhis face to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight, but,\nmiscalculating the distance, knocked it off. Torpenhow saw that his hair was\ngray on the temples, and that his face was the face of an old man.",
                "\"Come down, you damned fool! Dickie, come off!\"",
                "And Dick came obediently, but as a tree falls, pitching sideways from the\nBisharin's saddle at Torpenhow's feet. His luck had held to the\nlast, even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head.",
                "Torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel, with Dick's body in his arms."
