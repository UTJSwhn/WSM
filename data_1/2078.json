                "PART THE FIRST  --  THE LOTUS",
                "In those days there were many hermits living in the desert. On both banks\n      of the Nile numerous huts, built by these solitary dwellers, of branches\n      held together by clay, were scattered at a little distance from each\n      other, so that the inhabitants could live alone, and yet help one another\n      in case of need. Churches, each surmounted by a cross, stood here and\n      there amongst the huts, and the monks flocked to them at each festival to\n      celebrate the services or to partake of the Communion. There were also,\n      here and there on the banks of the river, monasteries, where the cenobites\n      lived in separate cells, and only met together that they might the better\n      enjoy their solitude.",
                "Both hermits and cenobites led abstemious lives, taking no food till after\n      sunset, and eating nothing but bread with a little salt and hyssop. Some\n      retired into the desert, and led a still more strange life in some cave or\n      tomb.",
                "All lived in temperance and chastity; they wore a hair shirt and a hood,\n      slept on the bare ground after long watching, prayed, sang psalms, and, in\n      short, spent their days in works of penitence. As an atonement for\n      original sin, they refused their body not only all pleasures and\n      satisfactions, but even that care and attention which in this age are\n      deemed indispensable. They believed that the diseases of our members\n      purify our souls, and the flesh could put on no adornment more glorious\n      than wounds and ulcers. Thus, they thought they fulfilled the words of the\n      prophet, \"The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.\"",
                "Amongst the inhabitants of the holy Thebaid, there were some who passed\n      their days in asceticism and contemplation; others gained their livelihood\n      by plaiting palm fibre, or by working at harvest-time for the neighbouring\n      farmers. The Gentiles wrongly suspected some of them of living by\n      brigandage, and allying themselves to the nomadic Arabs who robbed the\n      caravans. But, as a matter of fact, the monks despised riches, and the\n      odour of their sanctity rose to heaven.",
                "Angels in the likeness of young men, came, staff in hand, as travellers,\n      to visit the hermitages; whilst demons -- having assumed the form of\n      Ethiopians or of animals -- wandered round the habitations of the\n      hermits in order to lead them into temptation. When the monks went in the\n      morning to fill their pitcher at the spring, they saw the footprints of\n      Satyrs and Aigipans in the sand. The Thebaid was, really and spiritually,\n      a battlefield, where, at all times, and more especially at night, there\n      were terrible conflicts between heaven and hell.",
                "The ascetics, furiously assailed by legions of the damned, defended\n      themselves -- with the help of God and the angels -- by fasting,\n      prayer, and penance. Sometimes carnal desires pricked them so cruelly that\n      they cried aloud with pain, and their lamentations rose to the starlit\n      heavens mingled with the howls of the hungry hyaenas. Then it was that the\n      demons appeared in delightful forms. For though the demons are, in\n      reality, hideous, they sometimes assume an appearance of beauty which\n      prevents their real nature from being recognised. The ascetics of the\n      Thebaid were amazed to see in their cells phantasms of delights unknown\n      even to the voluptuaries of the age. But, as they were under the sign of\n      the Cross, they did not succumb to these temptations, and the unclean\n      spirits, assuming again their true character, fled at daybreak, filled\n      with rage and shame. It was not unusual to meet at dawn one of these\n      beings, flying away and weeping, and replying to those who questioned it,\n      \"I weep and groan because one of the Christians who live here has beaten\n      me with rods, and driven me away in ignominy.\"",
                "The power of the old saints of the desert extended over all sinners and\n      unbelievers. Their goodness was sometimes terrible. They derived from the\n      Apostles authority to punish all offences against the true and only God,\n      and no earthly power could save those they condemned. Strange tales were\n      told in the cities, and even as far as Alexandria, how the earth had\n      opened and swallowed up certain wicked persons whom one of these saints\n      struck with his staff. Therefore they were feared by all evil-doers, and\n      particularly by mimes, mountebanks, married priests, and prostitutes.",
                "Such was the sanctity of these holy men that even wild beasts felt their\n      power. When a hermit was about to die, a lion came and dug a grave with\n      its claws. The saint knew by this that God had called him, and he went and\n      kissed all his brethren on the cheek. Then he lay down joyfully, and slept\n      in the Lord.",
                "Now that Anthony, who was more than a hundred years old, had retired to\n      Mount Colzin with his well-beloved disciples, Macarius and Amathas, there\n      was no monk in the Thebaid more renowned for good works than Paphnutius,\n      the Abbot of Antinoe. Ephrem and Serapion had a greater number of\n      followers, and in the spiritual and temporal management of their\n      monasteries surpassed him. But Paphnutius observed the most rigorous\n      fasts, and often went for three entire days without taking food. He wore a\n      very rough hair shirt, he flogged himself night and morning, and lay for\n      hours with his face to the earth.",
                "His twenty-four disciples had built their huts near his, and imitated his\n      austerities. He loved them all dearly in Jesus Christ, and unceasingly\n      exhorted them to good works. Amongst his spiritual children were men who\n      had been robbers for many years, and had been persuaded by the\n      exhortations of the holy abbot to embrace the monastic life, and who now\n      edified their companions by the purity of their lives. One, who had been\n      cook to the Queen of Abyssinia, and was converted by the Abbot of Antinoe,\n      never ceased to weep. There was also Flavian, the deacon, who knew the\n      Scriptures, and spoke well; but the disciple of Paphnutius who surpassed\n      all the others in holiness was a young peasant named Paul, and surnamed\n      the Fool, because of his extreme simplicity. Men laughed at his\n      childishness, but God favoured him with visions, and by bestowing upon him\n      the gift of prophecy.",
                "Paphnutius passed his life in teaching his disciples, and in ascetic\n      practices. Often did he meditate upon the Holy Scriptures in order to find\n      allegories in them. Therefore he abounded in good works, though still\n      young. The devils, who so rudely assailed the good hermits, did not dare\n      to approach him. At night, seven little jackals sat in the moonlight in\n      front of his cell, silent and motionless, and with their ears pricked up.\n      It was believed that they were seven devils, who, owing to his sanctity,\n      could not cross his threshold.",
                "Paphnutius was born at Alexandria of noble parents, who had instructed him\n      in all profane learning. He had even been allured by the falsehoods of the\n      poets, and in his early youth had been misguided enough to believe that\n      the human race had all been drowned by a deluge in the days of Deucalion,\n      and had argued with his fellow-scholars concerning the nature, the\n      attributes, and even the existence of God. He then led a life of\n      dissipation, after the manner of the Gentiles, and he recalled the memory\n      of those days with shame and horror.",
                "\"At that time,\" he used to say to the brethren, \"I seethed in the cauldron\n      of false delights.\"",
                "He meant by that that he had eaten food properly dressed, and frequented\n      the public baths. In fact, until his twentieth year he had continued to\n      lead the ordinary existence of those times, which now seemed to him rather\n      death than life; but, owing to the lessons of the priest Macrinus, he then\n      became a new man.",
                "The truth penetrated him through and through, and -- as he used to say -- entered\n      his soul like a sword. He embraced the faith of Calvary, and worshipped\n      Christ crucified. After his baptism he remained yet a year amongst the\n      Gentiles, unable to cast off the bonds of old habits. But one day he\n      entered a church, and heard a deacon read from the Bible, the verse, \"If\n      thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.\"\n       Thereupon he sold all that he had, gave away the money in alms, and\n      embraced the monastic life.",
                "During the ten years that he had lived remote from men, he no longer\n      seethed in the cauldron of false delights, but more profitably macerated\n      his flesh in the balms of penitence.",
                "One day when, according to his pious custom, he was recalling to mind the\n      hours he had lived apart from God, and examining his sins one by one, that\n      he might the better ponder on their enormity, he remembered that he had\n      seen at the theatre at Alexandria a very beautiful actress named Thais.\n      This woman showed herself in the public games, and did not scruple to\n      perform dances, the movements of which, arranged only too cleverly,\n      brought to mind the most horrible passions. Sometimes she imitated the\n      horrible deeds which the Pagan fables ascribe to Venus, Leda, or Pasiphae.\n      Thus she fired all the spectators with lust, and when handsome young men,\n      or rich old ones, came, inspired with love, to hang wreaths of flowers\n      round her door, she welcomed them, and gave herself up to them. So that,\n      whilst she lost her own soul, she also ruined the souls of many others.",
                "She had almost led Paphnutius himself into the sins of the flesh. She had\n      awakened desire in him, and he had once approached the house of Thais. But\n      he stopped on the threshold of the courtesan's house, partly restrained by\n      the natural timidity of extreme youth -- he was then but fifteen years\n      old -- and partly by the fear of being refused on account of his want\n      of money, for his parents took care that he should commit no great\n      extravagances.",
                "God, in His mercy, had used these two means to prevent him from committing\n      a great sin. But Paphnutius had not been grateful to Him for that, because\n      at that time he was blind to his own interests, and did not know that he\n      was lusting after false delights. Now, kneeling in his cell, before the\n      image of that holy cross on which hung, as in a balance, the ransom of the\n      world, Paphnutius began to think of Thais, because Thais was a sin to him,\n      and he meditated long, according to ascetic rules, on the fearful\n      hideousness of the carnal delights with which this woman had inspired him\n      in the days of his sin and ignorance. After some hours of meditation the\n      image of Thais appeared to him clearly and distinctly. He saw her again,\n      as he had seen her when she tempted him, in all the beauty of the flesh.\n      At first she showed herself like a Leda, softly lying upon a bed of\n      hyacinths, her head bowed, her eyes humid and filled with a strange light,\n      her nostrils quivering, her mouth half open, her breasts like two flowers,\n      and her arms smooth and fresh as two brooks. At this sight Paphnutius\n      struck his breast and said --",
                "\"I call Thee to witness, my God, that I have considered how heinous has\n      been my sin.\"",
                "Gradually the face of the image changed its expression. Little by little\n      the lips of Thais, by lowering at the corners of the mouth, expressed a\n      mysterious suffering. Her large eyes were filled with tears and lights;\n      her breast heaved with sighs, like the sighing of a wind that precedes a\n      tempest. At this sight Paphnutius was troubled to the bottom of his soul.\n      Prostrating himself on the floor, he uttered this prayer --",
                "\"Thou who hast put pity in our hearts, like the morning dew upon the\n      fields, O just and merciful God, be Thou blessed! Praise! praise be unto\n      Thee! Put away from Thy servant that false tenderness which tempts to\n      concupiscence, and grant that I may only love Thy creatures in Thee, for\n      they pass away, but Thou endurest for ever. If I care for this woman, it\n      is only because she is Thy handiwork. The angels themselves feel pity for\n      her. Is she not, O Lord, the breath of Thy mouth? Let her not continue to\n      sin with many citizens and strangers. There is great pity for her in my\n      heart. Her wickednesses are abominable, and but to think of them makes my\n      flesh creep. But the more wicked she is, the more do I lament for her. I\n      weep when I think that the devils will torment her to all eternity.\"",
                "As he was meditating in this way, he saw a little jackal lying at his\n      feet. He felt much surprised, for the door of his cell had been closed\n      since the morning. The animal seemed to read the Abbot's thoughts, and\n      wagged its tail like a dog. Paphnutius made the sign of the cross and the\n      beast vanished. He knew then that, for the first time, the devil had\n      entered his cell, and he uttered a short prayer; then he thought again\n      about Thais.",
                "\"With God's help,\" he said to himself, \"I must save her.\" And he slept.",
                "The next morning, when he had said his prayers, he went to see the sainted\n      Palemon, a holy hermit who lived some distance away. He found him smiling\n      quietly as he dug the ground, as was his custom. Palemon was an old man,\n      and cultivated a little garden; the wild beasts came and licked his hands,\n      and the devils never tormented him.",
                "\"May God be praised, brother Paphnutius,\" he said, as he leaned upon his\n      spade.",
                "\"God be praised!\" replied Paphnutius. \"And peace be unto my brother.\"",
                "\"The like peace be unto thee, brother Paphnutius,\" said Palemon; and he\n      wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.",
                "\"Brother Palemon, all our discourse ought to be solely the praise of Him\n      who has promised to be wheresoever two or three are gathered together in\n      His Name. That is why I come to you concerning a design I have formed to\n      glorify the Lord.\"",
                "\"May the Lord bless thy design, Paphnutius, as He has blessed my lettuces.\n      Every morning He spreads His grace with the dew on my garden, and His\n      goodness causes me to glorify Him in the cucumbers and melons which He\n      gives me. Let us pray that He may keep us in His peace. For nothing is\n      more to be feared than those unruly passions which trouble our hearts.\n      When these passions disturb us we are like drunken men, and we stagger\n      from right to left unceasingly, and are like to fall miserably. Sometimes\n      these passions plunge us into a turbulent joy, and he who gives way to\n      such, sullies the air with brutish laughter. Such false joy drags the\n      sinner into all sorts of excess. But sometimes also the troubles of the\n      soul and of the senses throw us into an impious sadness which is a\n      thousand times worse than the joy. Brother Paphnutius, I am but a\n      miserable sinner, but I have found, in my long life, that the cenobite has\n      no foe worse than sadness. I mean by that the obstinate melancholy which\n      envelopes the soul as in a mist, and hides from us the light of God.\n      Nothing is more contrary to salvation, and the devil's greatest triumph is\n      to sow black and bitter thoughts in the heart of a good man. If he sent us\n      only pleasurable temptations, he would not be half so much to be feared.\n      Alas! he excels in making us sad. Did he not show to our father Anthony a\n      black child of such surpassing beauty that the very sight of it drew\n      tears? With God's help, our father Anthony avoided the snares of the\n      demon. I knew him when he lived amongst us; he was cheerful with his\n      disciples, and never gave way to melancholy. But did you not come, my\n      brother, to talk to me of a design you had formed in your mind? Let me\n      know what it is -- if, at least, this design has for its object the\n      glory of God.\"",
                "\"Brother Palemon, what I propose is really to the glory of God. Strengthen\n      me with your counsel, for you know many things, and sin has never darkened\n      the clearness of your mind.\"",
                "\"Brother Paphnutius, I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of thy\n      sandals, and my sins are as countless as the sands of the desert. But I am\n      old, and I will never refuse the help of my experience.\"",
                "\"I will confide in you, then, brother Palemon, that I am stricken with\n      grief at the thought that there is, in Alexandria, a courtesan named\n      Thais, who lives in sin, and is a subject of reproach unto the people.\"",
                "\"Brother Paphnutius, that is, in truth, an abomination which we do well to\n      deplore. There are many women amongst the Gentiles who lead lives of that\n      kind. Have you thought of any remedy for this great evil?\"",
                "\"Brother Palemon, I will go to Alexandria and find this woman, and, with\n      God's help, I will convert her; that is my intention; do you approve of\n      it, brother?\"",
                "\"Brother Paphnutius, I am but a miserable sinner, but our father Anthony\n      used to say, 'In whatsoever place thou art, hasten not to leave it to go\n      elsewhere.'\"",
                "\"Brother Palemon, do you disapprove of my project?\"",
                "\"Dear Paphnutius, God forbid that I should suspect my brother of bad\n      intentions. But our father Anthony also said, 'Fishes die on dry land, and\n      so is it with those monks who leave their cells and mingle with the men of\n      this world, amongst whom no good thing is to be found.'\"",
                "Having thus spoken, the old man pressed his foot on the spade, and began\n      to dig energetically round a fig tree laden with fruit. As he was thus\n      engaged, there was a rustling in the bushes, and an antelope leaped over\n      the hedge which surrounded the garden; it stopped, surprised and\n      frightened, its delicate legs trembling, then ran up to the old man, and\n      laid its pretty head on the breast of its friend.",
                "\"God be praised in the gazelle of the desert,\" said Palemon.",
                "He went to his hut, the light-footed little animal trotting after him, and\n      brought out some black bread, which the antelope ate out of his hand.",
                "Paphnutius remained thoughtful for some time, his eyes fixed upon the\n      stones at his feet. Then he slowly walked back to his cell, pondering on\n      what he had heard. A great struggle was going on in his mind.",
                "\"The hermit gives good advice,\" he said to himself; \"the spirit of\n      prudence is in him. And he doubts the wisdom of my intention. Yet it would\n      be cruel to leave Thais any longer in the power of the demon who possesses\n      her. May God advise and conduct me.\"",
                "As he was walking along, he saw a plover, caught in the net that a hunter\n      had laid on the sand, and he knew that it was a hen bird, for he saw the\n      male fly to the net, and tear the meshes one by one with its beak, until\n      it had made an opening by which its mate could escape. The holy man\n      watched this incident, and as, by virtue of his holiness, he easily\n      comprehended the mystic sense of all occurrences, he knew that the captive\n      bird was no other than Thais, caught in the snares of sin, and that -- like\n      the plover that had cut the hempen threads with its beak -- he could,\n      by pronouncing the word of power, break the invisible bonds by which Thais\n      was held in sin. Therefore he praised God, and was confirmed in his first\n      resolution. But then seeing the plover caught by the feet, and hampered by\n      the net it had broken, he fell into uncertainty again.",
                "He did not sleep all night, and before dawn he had a vision. Thais\n      appeared to him again. There was no expression of guilty pleasure on her\n      face, nor was she dressed according to custom in transparent drapery. She\n      was enveloped in a shroud, which hid even a part of her face, so that the\n      Abbot could see nothing but the two eyes, from which flowed white and\n      heavy tears.",
                "At this sight he began to weep, and believing that this vision came from\n      God, he no longer hesitated. He rose, seized a knotted stick, the symbol\n      of the Christian faith, and left his cell, carefully closing the door,\n      lest the animals of the desert and the birds of the air should enter, and\n      befoul the copy of the Holy Scriptures which stood at the head of his bed.\n      He called Flavian, the deacon, and gave him authority over the other\n      twenty-three disciples during his absence; and then, clad only in a long\n      cassock, he bent his steps towards the Nile, intending to follow the\n      Libyan bank to the city founded by the Macedonian monarch. He walked from\n      dawn to eve, indifferent to fatigue, hunger, and thirst; the sun was\n      already low on the horizon when he saw the dreadful river, the blood-red\n      waters of which rolled between the rocks of gold and fire.",
                "He kept along the shore, begging his bread at the door of solitary huts\n      for the love of God, and joyfully receiving insults, refusals, or threats.\n      He feared neither robbers nor wild beasts, but he took great care to avoid\n      all the towns and villages he came near. He was afraid lest he should see\n      children playing at knuckle-bones before their father's house, or meet, by\n      the side of the well, women in blue smocks, who might put down their\n      pitcher and smile at him. All things are dangerous for the hermit; it is\n      sometimes a danger for him to read in the Scriptures that the Divine\n      Master journeyed from town to town and supped with His disciples. The\n      virtues that the anchorites embroider so carefully on the tissue of faith,\n      are as fragile as they are beautiful; a breath of ordinary life may\n      tarnish their pleasant colours. For that reason, Paphnutius avoided the\n      towns, fearing lest his heart should soften at the sight of his fellow\n      men.",
                "He journeyed along lonely roads. When evening came, the murmuring of the\n      breeze amidst the tamarisk trees made him shiver, and he pulled his hood\n      over his eyes that he might not see how beautiful all things were. After\n      walking six days, he came to a place called Silsile. There the river runs\n      in a narrow valley, bordered by a double chain of granite mountains. It\n      was there that the Egyptians, in the days when they worshipped demons,\n      carved their idols. Paphnutius saw an enormous sphinx carved in the solid\n      rock. Fearing that it might still possess some diabolical properties, he\n      made the sign of the cross, and pronounced the name of Jesus; he\n      immediately saw a bat fly out of one of the monster's ears, and Paphnutius\n      knew that he had driven out the evil spirits which had been for centuries\n      in the figure. His zeal increased, and picking up a large stone, he threw\n      it in the idol's face. Then the mysterious face of the sphinx expressed\n      such profound sadness that Paphnutius was moved. In fact, the expression\n      of superhuman grief on the stone visage would have touched even the most\n      unfeeling man. Therefore Paphnutius said to the sphinx --",
                "\"O monster, be like the satyrs and centaurs our father Anthony saw in the\n      desert, and confess the divinity of Jesus Christ, and I will bless thee in\n      the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\"",
                "When he had spoken a rosy light gleamed in the eyes of the sphinx; the\n      heavy eyelids of the monster quivered and the granite lips painfully\n      murmured, as though in echo to the man's voice, the holy name of Jesus\n      Christ; therefore Paphnutius stretched out his right hand, and blessed the\n      sphinx of Silsile.",
                "That being done, he resumed his journey, and the valley having grown\n      wider, he saw the ruins of an immense city. The temples, which still\n      remained standing, were supported by idols which served as columns, and -- by\n      the permission of God -- these figures with women's heads and cow's\n      horns, threw on Paphnutius a long look which made him turn pale. He walked\n      thus seventeen days, his only food a few raw herbs, and he slept at night\n      in some ruined palace, amongst the wild cats and Pharaoh's rats, with\n      which mingled sometimes, women whose bodies ended in a scaly tail. But\n      Paphnutius knew that these women came from hell, and he drove them away by\n      making the sign of the cross.",
                "On the eighteenth day, he found, far from any village, a wretched hut made\n      of palm leaves, and half buried under the sand which had been driven by\n      the desert wind. He approached it, hoping that the hut was inhabited by\n      some pious anchorite. He saw inside the hovel -- for there was no door -- a\n      pitcher, a bunch of onions, and a bed of dried leaves.",
                "\"This must be the habitation of a hermit,\" he said to himself. \"Hermits\n      are generally to be found near their hut, and I shall not fail to meet\n      this one. I will give him the kiss of peace, even as the holy Anthony did\n      when he came to the hermit Paul, and kissed him three times. We will\n      discourse of things eternal, and perhaps our Lord will send us, by one of\n      His ravens, a crust of bread, which my host will willingly invite me to\n      share with him.\"",
                "Whilst he was thus speaking to himself, he walked round the hut to see if\n      he could find any one. He had not walked a hundred paces when he saw a man\n      seated, with his legs crossed, by the side of the river. The man was\n      naked; his hair and beard were quite white, and his body redder than\n      brick. Paphnutius felt sure this must be the hermit. He saluted him with\n      the words the monks are accustomed to use when they meet each other.",
                "\"Peace be with you, brother! May you some day taste the sweet joys of\n      paradise.\"",
                "The man did not reply. He remained motionless, and appeared not to have\n      heard. Paphnutius supposed this was due to one of those rhapsodies to\n      which the saints are accustomed. He knelt down, with his hands joined, by\n      the side of the unknown, and remained thus in prayer till sunset. Then,\n      seeing that his companion had not moved, he said to him --",
                "\"Father, if you are now out of the ecstasy in which you were lost, give me\n      your blessing in our Lord Jesus Christ.\"",
                "The other replied without turning his head --",
                "\"Stranger, I understand you not, and I know not the Lord Jesus Christ.\"",
                "\"What!\" cried Paphnutius. \"The prophets have announced Him; legions of\n      martyrs have confessed His name; Caesar himself has worshipped Him, and,\n      but just now, I made the sphinx of Silsile proclaim His glory. Is it\n      possible that you do not know Him?\"",
                "\"Friend,\" replied the other, \"it is possible. It would even be certain, if\n      anything in this world were certain.\"",
                "Paphnutius was surprised and saddened by the incredible ignorance of the\n      man.",
                "\"If you know not Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"all your works serve no purpose,\n      and you will never rise to life immortal.\"",
                "The old man replied --",
                "\"It is useless to act, or to abstain from acting. It matters not whether\n      we live or die.\"",
                "\"Eh, what?\" asked Paphnutius. \"Do you not desire to live through all\n      eternity? But, tell me, do you not live in a hut in the desert as the\n      hermits do?\"",
                "\"It seems so.\"",
                "\"Do I not see you naked, and lacking all things?\"",
                "\"It seems so.\"",
                "\"Do you not feed on roots, and live in chastity?\"",
                "\"It seems so.\"",
                "\"Have you not renounced all the vanities of this world?\"",
                "\"I have truly renounced all those vain things for which men commonly\n      care.\"",
                "\"Then you are like me, poor, chaste, and solitary. And you are not so -- as\n      I am -- for the love of God, and with a hope of celestial happiness!\n      That I cannot understand. Why are you virtuous if you do not believe in\n      Jesus Christ? Why deprive yourself of the good things of this world if you\n      do not hope to gain eternal riches in heaven?\"",
                "\"Stranger, I deprive myself of nothing which is good, and I flatter myself\n      that I have found a life which is satisfactory enough, though -- to\n      speak more precisely -- there is no such thing as a good or evil life.\n      Nothing is itself, either virtuous or shameful, just or unjust, pleasant\n      or painful, good or bad. It is our opinion which gives those qualities to\n      things, as salt gives savour to meats.\"",
                "\"So then, according to you there is no certainty. You deny the truth which\n      the idolaters themselves have sought. You lie in ignorance -- like a\n      tired dog sleeping in the mud.\"",
                "\"Stranger, it is equally useless to abuse either dogs or philosophers. We\n      know not what dogs are or what we are. We know nothing.\"",
                "\"Old man, do you belong, then, to the absurd sect of sceptics? Are you one\n      of those miserable fools who alike deny movement and rest, and who know\n      not how to distinguish between the light of the sun and the shadows of\n      night?\"",
                "\"Friend, I am truly a sceptic, and of a sect which appears praiseworthy to\n      me, though it seems ridiculous to you. For the same things often assume\n      different appearances. The pyramids of Memphis seem at sunrise to be cones\n      of pink light. At sunset they look like black triangles against the\n      illuminated sky. But who shall solve the problem of their true nature? You\n      reproach me with denying appearances, when, in fact, appearances are the\n      only realities I recognise. The sun seems to me illuminous, but its nature\n      is unknown to me. I feel that fire burns -- but I know not how or why.\n      My friend, you understand me badly. Besides, it is indifferent to me\n      whether I am understood one way or the other.\"",
                "\"Once more. Why do you live on dates and onions in the desert? Why do you\n      endure great hardships? I endure hardships equally great, and, like you, I\n      live in abstinence and solitude. But then it is to please God, and to earn\n      eternal happiness. And that is a reasonable object, for it is wise to\n      suffer now for a future gain. It is senseless, on the contrary, to expose\n      yourself voluntarily to useless fatigue and vain sufferings. If I did not\n      believe -- pardon my blasphemy, O uncreated Light! -- if I did not\n      believe in the truth of that which God has taught us by the voice of the\n      prophets, by the example of His Son, by the acts of the Apostles, by the\n      authority of councils, and by the testimony of the martyrs, -- if I did\n      not know that the sufferings of the body are necessary for the salvation\n      of the soul -- if I were, like thee, lost in ignorance of sacred\n      mysteries -- I would return at once amongst the men of this day, I\n      would strive to acquire riches, that I might live in ease, like those who\n      are happy in this world, and I would say to the votaries of pleasure,\n      'Come, my daughters, come, my servants, come and pour out for me your\n      wines, your philtres, your perfumes.' But you, foolish old man! you\n      deprive yourself of all these advantages; you lose without hope of any\n      gain; you give without hope of any return, and you imitate foolishly the\n      noble deeds of us anchorites, as an impudent monkey thinks, by smearing a\n      wall, to copy the picture of a clever artist. What, then, are your\n      reasons, O most besotted of men?\"",
                "Paphnutius spoke with violence and indignation, but the old man remained\n      unmoved.",
                "\"Friend,\" he replied, gently, \"what matter the reasons of a dog sleeping\n      in the dirt or a mischievous ape?\"",
                "Paphnutius' only aim was the glory of God. His anger vanished, and he\n      apologised with noble humility.",
                "\"Pardon me, old man, my brother,\" he said, \"if zeal for the truth has\n      carried me beyond proper bounds. God is my witness, that it is thy errors\n      and not thyself that I hate. I suffer to see thee in darkness, for I love\n      thee in Jesus Christ, and care for thy salvation fills my heart. Speak!\n      give me your reasons. I long to know them that I may refute them.\"",
                "The old man replied quietly --",
                "\"It is the same to me whether I speak or remain silent. I will give my\n      reasons without asking yours in return, for I have no interest in you at\n      all. I care neither for your happiness nor your misfortune, and it matters\n      not to me whether you think one way or another. Why should I love you, or\n      hate you? Aversion and sympathy are equally unworthy of the wise man. But\n      since you question me, know then that I am named Timocles, and that I was\n      born at Cos, of parents made rich by commerce. My father was a shipowner.\n      In intelligence he much resembled Alexander, who is surnamed the Great.\n      But he was not so gross. In short, he was a man of no great parts. I had\n      two brothers, who, like him, were shipowners. As for me, I followed\n      wisdom. My eldest brother was compelled by my father to marry a Carian\n      woman, named Timaessa, who displeased him so greatly that he could not\n      live with her without falling into a deep melancholy. However, Timaessa\n      inspired our younger brother with a criminal passion, and this passion\n      soon turned to a furious madness. The Carian woman hated them both\n      equally; but she loved a flute-player, and received him at night in her\n      chamber. One morning he left there the wreath which he usually wore at\n      feasts. My two brothers, having found this wreath, swore to kill the\n      flute-player, and the next day they caused him to perish under the lash,\n      in spite of his tears and prayers. My sister-in-law felt such grief that\n      she lost her reason, and these three poor wretches became beasts rather\n      than human beings, and wandered insane along the shores of Cos, howling\n      like wolves and foaming at the mouth, and hooted at by the children, who\n      threw shells and stones at them. They died, and my father buried them with\n      his own hands. A little later his stomach refused all nourishment, and he\n      died of hunger, though he was rich enough to have bought all the meats and\n      fruits in the markets of Asia. He was deeply grieved at having to leave me\n      his fortune. I used it in travels. I visited Italy, Greece, and Africa\n      without meeting a single person who was either wise or happy. I studied\n      philosophy at Athens and Alexandria, and was deafened by noisy arguments.\n      At last I wandered as far as India, and I saw on the banks of the Ganges a\n      naked man, who had sat there motionless with his legs crossed for more\n      than thirty years. Climbing plants twined round his dried up body, and the\n      birds built their nests in his hair. Yet he lived. At the sight of him I\n      called to mind Timaessa, the flute-player, my two brothers, and my father,\n      and I realised that this Indian was a wise man. 'Men,' I said to myself,\n      'suffer because they are deprived of that which they believe to be good;\n      or because, possessing it they fear to lose it; or because they endure\n      that which they believe to be an evil. Put an end to all beliefs of this\n      kind, and the evils would disappear.' That is why I resolved henceforth to\n      deem nothing an advantage, to tear myself entirely from the good things of\n      this world, and to live silent and motionless, like the Indian.\"",
                "Paphnutius had listened attentively to the old man's story.",
                "\"Timocles of Cos,\" he replied, \"I own that your discourse is not wholly\n      devoid of sense. It is, in truth, wise to despise the riches of this\n      world. But it would be absurd to despise also your eternal welfare, and\n      render yourself liable to be visited by the wrath of God. I grieve at your\n      ignorance, Timocles, and I will instruct you in the truth, in order that\n      knowing that there really exists a God in three hypostases, you may obey\n      this God as a child obeys its father.\"",
                "Timocles interrupted him.",
                "\"Refrain, stranger, from showing me your doctrines, and do not imagine\n      that you will persuade me to share your opinions. All discussions are\n      useless. My opinion is to have no opinion. My life is devoid of trouble\n      because I have no preferences. Go thy ways, and strive not to withdraw me\n      from the beneficent apathy in which I am plunged, as though in a delicious\n      bath, after the hardships of my past days.\"",
                "Paphnutius was profoundly instructed in all things relating to the faith.\n      By his knowledge of the human heart, he was aware that the grace of God\n      had not fallen on old Timocles, and the day of salvation for this soul so\n      obstinately resolved to ruin itself had not yet come. He did not reply,\n      lest the power given for edification should turn to destruction. For it\n      sometimes happens, in disputing with infidels, that the means used for\n      their conversion may steep them still farther in sin. Therefore they who\n      possess the truth should take care how they spread it.",
                "\"Farewell, then, unhappy Timocles,\" he said; and heaving a deep sigh, he\n      resumed his pious pilgrimage through the night.",
                "In the morning, he saw the ibises motionless on one leg at the edge of the\n      water, which reflected their pale pink necks. The willows stretched their\n      soft grey foliage to the bank, cranes flew in a triangle in the clear sky,\n      and the cry of unseen herons was heard from the sedges. Far as the eye\n      could reach, the river rolled its broad green waters o'er which white\n      sails, like the wings of birds, glided, and here and there on the shores,\n      a white house shone out. A light mist floated along the banks, and from\n      out the shadow of the islands, which were laden with palms, flowers, and\n      fruits, came noisy flocks of ducks, geese, flamingoes, and teal. To the\n      left, the grassy valley extended to the desert its fields and orchards in\n      joyful abundance; the sun shone on the yellow wheat, and the earth exhaled\n      forth its fecundity in odorous wafts. At this sight, Paphnutius fell on\n      his knees, and cried --",
                "\"Blessed be the Lord, who has given a happy issue to my journey. O God,\n      who spreadest Thy dew upon the fig trees of the Arsiniote, pour Thy grace\n      upon Thais, whom Thou hast formed with Thy love, as Thou hast the flowers\n      and trees of the field. May she, by Thy loving care, flourish like a\n      sweet-scented rose in the heavenly Jerusalem.\"",
                "And every time that he saw a tree covered with blossom, or a bird of\n      brilliant plumage, he thought of Thais. Keeping along the left arm of the\n      river and through a fertile and populous district, he reached, in a few\n      days, the city of Alexandria, which the Greeks have surnamed the Beautiful\n      and the Golden. The sun had risen an hour, when he beheld, from the top of\n      a hill, the vast city, the roofs of which glittered in the rosy light. He\n      stopped, and folded his arms on his breast.",
                "\"There, then,\" he said, \"is the delightful spot where I was born in sin;\n      the bright air where I breathed poisonous perfumes; the sea of pleasure\n      where I heard the songs of the sirens. There is my cradle, after the\n      flesh; my native land -- in the parlance of the men of these days! A\n      rich cradle, an illustrious country, in the judgment of men! It is natural\n      that thy children should reverence thee like a mother, Alexandria, and I\n      was begotten in thy magnificently adorned breast. But the ascetic despises\n      nature, the mystic scorns appearances, the Christian regards his native\n      land as a place of exile, the monk is not of this earth. I have turned\n      away my heart from loving thee, Alexandria. I hate thee! I hate thee for\n      thy riches, thy science, thy pleasures, and thy beauty. Be accursed,\n      temple of demons!

And thou, winged son of heaven who led the holy\n      hermit Anthony, our father, when he came from the depths of the desert,\n      and entered into the citadel of idolatry to strengthen the faith of\n      believers and the confidence of martyrs, beautiful angel of the Lord,\n      invisible child, first breath of God, fly thou before me, and cleanse, by\n      the beating of thy wings, the corrupted air I am about to breathe amongst\n      the princes of darkness of this world!\"",
                "Having thus spoken, he resumed his journey. He entered the city by the\n      Gate of the Sun. This gate was a handsome structure of stone. In the\n      shadow of its arch, crowded some poor wretches, who offered lemons and\n      figs for sale, or with many groans and lamentations, begged for an obolus.",
                "An old woman in rags, who was kneeling there, seized the monk's cassock,\n      kissed it, and said --",
                "\"Man of the Lord, bless me, that God may bless me. I have suffered many\n      things in this world that I may have joys in the world to come. You come\n      from God, O holy man, and that is why the dust of your feet is more\n      precious than gold.\"",
                "\"The Lord be praised!\" said Paphnutius, and with his half-closed hand he\n      made the sign of redemption on the old woman's head.",
                "But hardly had he gone twenty paces down the street, than a band of\n      children began to jeer at him, and throw stones, crying --",
                "\"Oh, the wicked monk! He is blacker than an ape, and more bearded than a\n      goat! He is a skulker! Why not hang him in an orchard, like a wooden\n      Priapus, to frighten the birds? But no; he would draw down the hail on the\n      apple-blossom. He brings bad luck.

Thus the same object is appreciated differently by men who are\n      uncertain in their judgment and liable to error.

His reasoning was much better than that of these\n      idolaters, who cry from the depths of their thick darkness, 'I see the\n      day!' Everything in this world is mirage and moving sand.

                "He passed through the city with rapid steps.

For that reason he struck his naked feet\n      roughly against the kerb-stones of the wide street, and rejoiced to see\n      the bloody marks of his wounded feet. Leaving on his left the magnificent\n      portico of the Temple of Serapis, he entered a road lined with splendid\n      mansions, which seemed to be drowsy with perfumes. Pines, maples, and\n      larches raised their heads above the red cornices and golden acroteria.\n      Through the half-open doors could be seen bronze statues in marble\n      vestibules, and fountains playing amidst foliage. No noise troubled the\n      stillness of these quiet retreats. Only the distant strains of a flute\n      could be heard.

Nicias\n      brought cushions for him, and offered him various meats and drinks, which\n      Paphnutius scornfully refused.",
                "\"Nicias,\" he said, \"I have not renounced what you falsely call the\n      Christian superstition, which is the truth of truths. 'In the beginning\n      was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things\n      were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In\n      Him was the life, and the life was the light of men.'\"",
                "\"My dear Paphnutius,\" replied Nicias, who had now put on a perfumed tunic,\n      \"do you expect to astonish me by reciting a lot of words jumbled together\n      without skill, which are no more than a vain murmur? Have you forgotten\n      that I am a bit of a philosopher myself? And do you think to satisfy me\n      with some rags, torn by ignorant men from the purple garment of AEmilius,\n      when AEmilius, Porphyry, and Plato, in all their glory, did not satisfy\n      me! The systems devised by the sages are but tales imagined to amuse the\n      eternal childishness of men. We divert ourselves with them, as we do with\n      the stories of The Ass, The Tub, and The Ephesian Matron,\n      or any other Milesian fable.\"",
                "And, taking his guest by the arm, he led him into a room where thousands\n      of papyri were rolled up and lay in baskets.",
                "\"This is my library,\" he said. \"It contains a small part of the various\n      systems which the philosophers have constructed to explain the world. The\n      Serapeium itself, with all its riches, does not contain them all. Alas!\n      they are but the dreams of sick men.\"",
                "He compelled his guest to sit down in an ivory chair, and sat down\n      himself. Paphnutius scowled gloomily at all the books in the library, and\n      said --",
                "\"They ought all to be burned.\"",
                "\"Oh, my dear guest, that would be a pity!\" replied Nicias. \"For the dreams\n      of sick men are sometimes amusing. Besides, if we should destroy all the\n      dreams and visions of men, the earth would lose its form and colours, and\n      we should all sleep in a dull stupidity.\"",
                "Paphnutius continued in the same strain as before --",
                "\"It is certain that the doctrines of the pagans are but vain lies. But\n      God, who is the truth, revealed Himself to men by miracles, and He was\n      made flesh, and lived among us.\"",
                "Nicias replied --",
                "\"You speak well, my dear Paphnutius, when you say that he was made flesh.\n      A God who thinks, acts, speaks, who wanders through nature, like Ulysses\n      of old on the glaucous sea, is altogether a man. How do you expect that we\n      should believe in this new Jupiter, when the urchins of Athens, in the\n      time of Pericles, no longer believed in the old one?",
                "\"But let us leave all that. You did not come here; I suppose, to argue\n      about the three hypostases. What can I do for you, my dear\n      fellow-scholar?\"",
                "\"A good deed,\" replied the Abbot of Antinoe. \"Lend me a perfumed tunic,\n      like the one you have just put on. Be kind enough to add to the tunic,\n      gilt sandals, and a vial of oil to anoint my beard and hair. It is needful\n      also, that you should give me a purse with a thousand drachmae in it.\n      That, O Nicias, is what I came to ask of you, for the love of God, and in\n      remembrance of our old friendship.\"",
                "Nicias made Crobyle and Myrtale bring his richest tunic; it was\n      embroidered, after the Asiatic fashion, with flowers and animals. The two\n      girls held it open, and skilfully showed its bright colours, waiting till\n      Paphnutius should have taken off the cassock which covered him down to his\n      feet. But the monk having declared that they should rather tear off his\n      flesh than this garment, they put on the tunic over it. As the two girls\n      were pretty, they were not afraid of men, although they were slaves. They\n      laughed at the strange appearance of the monk thus clad. Crobyle called\n      him her dear satrap, as she presented him with the mirror, and Myrtale\n      pulled his beard. But Paphnutius prayed to the Lord, and did not look at\n      them. Having tied on the gilt sandals, and fastened the purse to his belt,\n      he said to Nicias, who was looking at him with an amused expression --",
                "\"O Nicias, let not these things be an offence in your eyes. For know that\n      I shall make pious use of this tunic, this purse, and these sandals.\"",
                "\"My dear friend,\" replied Nicias, \"I suspect no evil, for I believe that\n      men are equally incapable of doing evil or doing good. Good and evil exist\n      only in the opinion. The wise man has only custom and usage to guide him\n      in his acts. I conform with all the prejudices which prevail at\n      Alexandria. That is why I pass for an honest man. Go, friend, and enjoy\n      yourself.\"",
                "But Paphnutius thought that it was needful to inform his host of his\n      intention.",
                "\"Do you know Thais,\" he said, \"who acts in the games at the theatre?\"",
                "\"She is beautiful,\" replied Nicias, \"and there was a time when she was\n      dear to me. For her sake, I sold a mill and two fields of corn, and I\n      composed in her honour three books full of detestably bad verses. Surely\n      beauty is the most powerful force in the world, and were we so made that\n      we could possess it always, we should care as little as may be for the\n      demiurgos, the logos, the aeons, and all the other reveries of the\n      philosophers. But I am surprised, my good Paphnutius, that you should have\n      come from the depths of the Thebaid to talk about Thais.\"",
                "Having said this, he sighed gently. And Paphnutius gazed at him with\n      horror, not conceiving it possible that a man should so calmly avow such a\n      sin. He expected to see the earth open, and Nicias swallowed up in flames.\n      But the earth remained solid, and the Alexandrian silent, his forehead\n      resting on his hand, and he smiling sadly at the memories of his past\n      youth. The monk rose, and continued in solemn tones --",
                "\"Know then, O Nicias, that, with the aid of God, I will snatch this woman\n      Thais from the unclean affections of the world, and give her as a spouse\n      to Jesus Christ. If the Holy Spirit does not forsake me, Thais will leave\n      this city and enter a nunnery.\"",
                "\"Beware of offending Venus,\" replied Nicias. \"She is a powerful goddess,\n      she will be angry with you if you take away her chief minister.\"",
                "\"God will protect me,\" said Paphnutius. \"May He also illumine thy heart, O\n      Nicias, and draw thee out of the abyss in which thou art plunged.\"",
                "And he stalked out of the room. But Nicias followed him, and overtook him\n      on the threshold, and placing his hand on his shoulder whispered into his\n      ear the same words --",
                "\"Beware of offending Venus; her vengeance is terrible.\"",
                "Paphnutius, disdainful of these trivial words, left without turning his\n      head. He felt only contempt for Nicias; but what he could not bear was the\n      idea that his former friend had received the caresses of Thais. It seemed\n      to him that to sin with that woman was more detestable than to sin with\n      any other. To him this appeared the height of iniquity, and he henceforth\n      looked upon Nicias as an object of execration. He had always hated\n      impurity, but never before had this vice appeared so heinous to him; never\n      before had it so seemed to merit the anger of Jesus Christ and the sorrow\n      of the angels.",
                "He felt only a more ardent desire to save Thais from the Gentiles, and\n      that he must hasten to see the actress in order to save her. Nevertheless,\n      before he could enter her house, he must wait till the heat of the day was\n      over, and now the morning had hardly finished. Paphnutius wandered through\n      the most frequented streets. He had resolved to take no food that day, in\n      order to be the less unworthy of the favours he had asked of the Lord. To\n      the great grief of his soul, he dared not enter any of the churches in the\n      city, because he knew they were profaned by the Arians, who had overturned\n      the Lord's table. For, in fact, these heretics, supported by the Emperor\n      of the East, had driven the patriarch Athanasius from his episcopate, and\n      sown trouble and confusion among the Christians of Alexandria.",
                "He therefore wandered about aimlessly, sometimes with his eyes fixed on\n      the ground in humility, and sometimes raised to heaven in ecstasy. After\n      some time, he found himself on the quay. Before him lay the harbour, in\n      which were sheltered innumerable ships and galleys, and beyond them,\n      smiling in blue and silver, lay the perfidious sea. A galley, which bore a\n      Nereid at its prow, had just weighed anchor. The rowers sang as the oars\n      struck the water; and already the white daughter of the waters, covered\n      with humid pearls, showed no more than a flying profile to the monk.\n      Steered by her pilot, she cleared the passage leading from the basin of\n      the Eunostos, and gained the high seas, leaving a glittering trail behind\n      her.",
                "\"I also,\" thought Paphnutius, \"once desired to embark singing on the ocean\n      of the world. But I soon saw my folly, and the Nereid did not carry me\n      away.\"",
                "Lost in his thoughts, he sat down upon a coil of rope, and went to sleep.\n      During his sleep, he had a vision. He seemed to hear the sound of a\n      clanging trumpet, and the sky became blood red, and he knew that the day\n      of judgment had come. Whilst he was fervently praying to God, he saw an\n      enormous monster coming towards him, bearing on its forehead a cross of\n      light, and he recognised the sphinx of Silsile. The monster seized him\n      between its teeth, without hurting him, and carried him in its mouth, as a\n      cat carries a kitten. Paphnutius was thus conveyed across many countries,\n      crossing rivers and traversing mountains, and came at last to a desert\n      place, covered with scowling rocks and hot cinders. The ground was rent in\n      many places, and through these openings came a hot air. The monster gently\n      put Paphnutius down on the ground, and said --",
                "\"Look!\"",
                "And Paphnutius, leaning over the edge of the abyss, saw a river of fire\n      which flowed in the interior of the earth, between two cliffs of black\n      rocks. There, in a livid light, the demons tormented the souls of the\n      damned. The souls preserved the appearance of the bodies which had held\n      them, and even wore some rags of clothing. These souls seemed peaceful in\n      the midst of their torments. One of them, tall and white, his eyes closed,\n      a white fillet across his forehead, and a sceptre in his hand, sang; his\n      voice filled the desert shores with harmony; he sang of gods and heroes.\n      Little green devils pierced his lips and throat with red-hot irons. And\n      the shade of Homer still sang. Near by, old Anaxagoras, bald and hoary,\n      traced figures in the dust with a compass. A demon poured boiling oil into\n      his ear, yet failed, however, to disturb the sage's meditations. And the\n      monk saw many other persons, who, on the dark shore by the side of the\n      burning river, read, or quietly meditated, or conversed with other spirits\n      while walking, -- like the sages and pupils under the shadow of the\n      sycamore trees of Academe. Old Timocles alone had withdrawn from the\n      others, and shook his head like a man who denies. One of the demons of the\n      abyss shook a torch before his eyes, but Timocles would see neither the\n      demon nor the torch.",
                "Mute with surprise at this spectacle, Paphnutius turned to the monster. It\n      had disappeared, and, in place of the sphinx, the monk saw a veiled woman,\n      who said --",
                "\"Look and understand. Such is the obstinacy of these infidels, that, even\n      in hell, they remain victims of the illusions which deluded them when on\n      earth. Death has not undeceived them; for it is very plain that it does\n      not suffice merely to die in order to see God. Those who are ignorant of\n      the truth whilst living, will be ignorant of it always. The demons which\n      are busy torturing these souls, what are they but agents of divine\n      justice? That is why these souls neither see them nor feel them. They were\n      ignorant of the truth, and therefore unaware of their own condemnation,\n      and God Himself cannot compel them to suffer.",
                "\"God can do all things,\" said the Abbot of Antinoe.",
                "\"He cannot do that which is absurd,\" replied the veiled woman. \"To punish\n      them, they must first be enlightened, and if they possessed the truth,\n      they would be like unto the elect.\"",
                "Vexed and horrified, Paphnutius again bent over the edge of the abyss. He\n      saw the shade of Nicias smiling, with a wreath of flowers on his head,\n      sitting under a burnt myrtle tree. By his side was Aspasia of Miletus,\n      gracefully draped in a woollen cloak, and they seemed to talk together of\n      love and philosophy; the expression of her face was sweet and noble. The\n      rain of fire which fell on them was as a refreshing dew, and their feet\n      pressed the burning soil as though it had been tender grass. At this sight\n      Paphnutius was filled with fury.",
                "\"Strike him, O God! strike him!\" he cried. \"It is Nicias! Let him weep!\n      let him groan! let him grind his teeth! He sinned with Thais!\"",
                "And Paphnutius woke in the arms of a sailor, as strong as Hercules, who\n      cried --",
                "\"Quietly! quietly! my friend! By Proteus, the old shepherd of the seals,\n      you slumber uneasily. If I had not caught hold of you, you would have\n      tumbled into the Eunostos. It is as true as that my mother sold salt fish,\n      that I saved your life.\"",
                "\"I thank God,\" replied Paphnutius.",
                "And, rising to his feet, he walked straight before him, meditating on the\n      vision which had come to him whilst he was asleep.",
                "\"This vision,\" he said to himself, \"is plainly an evil one; it is an\n      insult to divine goodness to imagine hell is unreal. The dream certainly\n      came from the devil.\"",
                "He reasoned thus because he knew how to distinguish between the dreams\n      sent by God and those produced by evil angels. Such discernment is useful\n      to the hermit, who lives surrounded by apparitions, and who, in avoiding\n      men, is sure to meet with spirits. The deserts are full of phantoms. When\n      the pilgrims drew near the ruined castle, to which the holy hermit,\n      Anthony, had retired, they heard a noise like that which goes up from the\n      public square of a large city at a great festival. The noise was made by\n      the devils, who were tempting the holy man.",
                "Paphnutius remembered this memorable example. He also called to mind St.\n      John the Egyptian, who for sixty years was tempted by the devil. But John\n      saw through all the tricks of the demon. One day, however, the devil,\n      having assumed the appearance of a man, entered the grotto of the\n      venerable John, and said to him, \"John, you must continue to fast until\n      to-morrow evening.\" And John, believing that it was an angel who spoke,\n      obeyed the voice of the demon, and fasted the next day until the vesper\n      hour. That was the only victory that the Prince of Darkness ever gained\n      over St. John the Egyptian, and that was but a trifling one. It was\n      therefore not astonishing that Paphnutius knew at once that the vision\n      which had visited him in his sleep was an evil one.",
                "Whilst he was gently remonstrating with God for having given him into the\n      power of the demons, he felt himself pushed and dragged amidst a crowd of\n      people who were all hurrying in the same direction. As he was unaccustomed\n      to walk in the streets of a city, he was shoved and knocked from one\n      passer to another like an inert mass; and being embarrassed by the folds\n      of his tunic, he was more than once on the point of falling. Desirous of\n      knowing where all these people could be going, he asked one of them the\n      cause of this hurry.",
                "\"Do you not know, stranger,\" replied he, \"that the games are about to\n      begin, and that Thais will appear on the stage? All the citizens are going\n      to the theatre, and I also am going. Would you like to accompany me?\"",
                "It occurred to him at once that it would further his design to see Thais\n      in the games, and Paphnutius followed the stranger. In front of them stood\n      the theatre, its portico ornamented with shining masks, and its huge\n      circular wall covered with innumerable statues. Following the crowd, they\n      entered a narrow passage, at the end of which lay the amphitheatre,\n      glittering with light. They took their places on one of the seats, which\n      descended in steps to the stage, which was empty but magnificently\n      decorated. There was no curtain to hide the view, and on the stage was a\n      mound, such as used to be erected in old times to the shades of heroes.\n      This mound stood in the midst of a camp. Lances were stacked in front of\n      the tents, and golden shields hung from masts, amidst boughs of laurel and\n      wreaths of oak. On the stage all was silence, but a murmur like the\n      humming of bees in a hive rose from the vast hemicycle filled with\n      spectators. All their faces, reddened by the reflection from the purple\n      awning which waved above them, turned with attentive curiosity towards the\n      large, silent stage, with its tomb and tents. The women laughed and ate\n      lemons, and the regular theatre-goers called gaily to one another from\n      their seats.",
                "Paphnutius prayed inwardly, and refrained from uttering any vain words,\n      but his neighbour began to complain of the decline of the drama.",
                "\"Formerly,\" he said, \"clever actors used to declaim, under a mask, the\n      verses of Euripides and Menander. Now they no longer recite dramas, they\n      act in dumb show; and of the divine spectacles with which Bacchus was\n      honoured in Athens, we have kept nothing but what a barbarian -- a\n      Scythian even -- could understand -- attitude and gesture. The\n      tragic mask, the mouth of which was provided with metal tongues that\n      increased the sound of the voice; the cothurnus, which raised the actors\n      to the height of gods; the tragic majesty and the splendid verses that\n      used to be sung, have all gone. Pantomimists, and dancing girls with bare\n      faces, have replaced Paulus and Roscius. What would the Athenians of the\n      days of Pericles have said if they had seen a woman on the stage? It is\n      indecent for a woman to appear in public. We must be very degenerate to\n      permit it. It is as certain as that my name is Dorion, that woman is the\n      natural enemy of man, and a disgrace to human kind.\"",
                "\"You speak wisely,\" replied Paphnutius; \"woman is our worst enemy. She\n      gives us pleasure, and is to be feared on that account.\"",
                "\"By the immovable gods,\" cried Dorion, \"it is not pleasure that woman\n      gives to man, but sadness, trouble, and black cares. Love is the cause of\n      our most biting evils. Listen, stranger. When I was a young man I visited\n      Troezene, in Argolis, and I saw there a myrtle of a most prodigious size,\n      the leaves of which were covered with innumerable pinholes. And this is\n      what the Troezenians say about that myrtle. Queen Phaedra, when she was in\n      love with Hippolytos, used to recline idly all day long under this same\n      tree. To beguile the tedium of her weary life she used to draw out the\n      golden pin which held her fair locks, and pierce with it the leaves of the\n      sweet-scented bush. All the leaves were riddled with holes. After she had\n      ruined the poor young man whom she pursued with her incestuous love,\n      Phaedra, as you know, perished miserably. She locked herself up in her\n      bridal chamber, and hanged herself by her golden girdle from an ivory peg.\n      The gods willed that the myrtle, the witness of her bitter misery, should\n      continue to bear, in its fresh leaves, the marks of the pin-holes. I\n      picked one of these leaves, and placed it at the head of my bed, that by\n      the sight of it I might take warning against the folly of love, and\n      conform to the doctrine of the divine Epicurus, my master, who taught that\n      all lust is to be feared. But, properly speaking, love is a disease of the\n      liver, and one is never sure of not catching the malady.\"",
                "Paphnutius asked --",
                "\"Dorion, what are your pleasures?\"",
                "Dorion replied sadly --",
                "\"I have only one pleasure, and, it must be confessed, that it is not a\n      very exciting one; it is meditation. When a man has a bad digestion, he\n      must not look for any others.\"",
                "Taking advantage of these words, Paphnutius proceeded to initiate the\n      Epicurean into those spiritual joys which the contemplation of God\n      procures. He began --",
                "\"Hear the truth, Dorion, and receive the light.\"",
                "But he saw then that all heads were turned towards him, and everybody was\n      making signs for him to be quiet. Dead silence prevailed in the theatre,\n      broken at last by the strains of heroic music.",
                "The play began. The soldiers left their tents, and were preparing to\n      depart, when a prodigy occurred -- a cloud covered the summit of the\n      funeral pile. Then the cloud rolled away, and the ghost of Achilles\n      appeared, clad in golden armour. Extending his arms towards the warriors,\n      he seemed to say to them, \"What! do you depart, children of Danaos? do you\n      return to the land I shall never behold again, and leave my tomb without\n      any offerings?\" Already the principal Greek chieftains pressed to the foot\n      of the pile. Acamas, the son of Theseus, old Nestor, Agamemnon, bearing a\n      sceptre and with a fillet on his brow, gazed at the prodigy. Pyrrhus, the\n      young son of Achilles, was prostrate in the dust. Ulysses, recognisable by\n      the cap which covered his curly hair, showed by his gestures that he\n      acquiesced in the demand of the hero's shade. He argued with Agamemnon,\n      and their words might be easily guessed --",
                "\"Achilles,\" said the King of Ithaca, \"is worthy to be honoured by us, for\n      he died gloriously for Hellas. He demands that the daughter of Priam, the\n      virgin Polyxena, should be immolated on his tomb. Greeks! appease the\n      manes of the hero, and let the son of Peleus rejoice in Hades.\"",
                "But the king of kings replied --",
                "\"Spare the Trojan virgins we have torn from the altars. Sufficient\n      misfortunes have already fallen on the illustrious race of Priam.\"",
                "He spoke thus because he shared the couch of the sister of Polyxena, and\n      the wise Ulysses reproached him for preferring the couch of Cassandra to\n      the lance of Achilles.",
                "The Greeks showed they shared the opinion of Ulysses, by loudly clashing\n      their weapons. The death of Polyxena was resolved on, and the appeased\n      shade of Achilles vanished. The music -- sometimes wild and sometimes\n      plaintive -- followed the thoughts of the personages in the drama. The\n      spectators burst into applause.",
                "Paphnutius, who applied divine truth to everything murmured --",

A long sigh\n      went up from the audience, when her woeful figure appeared. Hecuba had\n      been warned by a prophetic dream, and lamented her daughter's fate and her\n      own. Ulysses approached her, and asked her to give up Polyxena. The old\n      mother tore her hair, dug her nails into her cheeks, and kissed the hands\n      of the cruel chieftain, who, with unpitying calmness, seemed to say --",

                "Then the curtain in front of one of the tents was raised, and the virgin\n      Polyxena appeared. A tremor passed through all the spectators. They had\n      recognised Thais. Paphnutius saw again the woman he had come to seek. With\n      her white arm she held above her head the heavy curtain. Motionless as a\n      splendid statue, she stood, with a look of pride and resignation in her\n      violet eyes, and her resplendent beauty made a shudder of commiseration\n      pass through all who beheld her.",
                "A murmur of applause uprose, and Paphnutius, his soul agitated, and\n      pressing both hands to his heart, sighed --",

But that is\n      but a freak of nature, and the atoms know not what they do. They will some\n      day separate with the same indifference as they came together. Where are\n      now the atoms which formed Lais or Cleopatra? I must confess that women\n      are sometimes beautiful. But they are liable to grievous afflictions, and\n      disgusting inconveniences. That is patent to all thinking men, though the\n      vulgar pay no attention to it. And women inspire love, though it is absurd\n      and ridiculous to love them.\"",
                "Such were the thoughts of the philosopher and the ascetic as they gazed on\n      Thais. They neither of them noticed Hecuba, who turned to her daughter,\n      and seemed to say by her gestures --",

And when,\n      with firm but light steps, she advanced towards Ulysses, her rhythmic\n      movements, which were accompanied by the sound of flutes, created in all\n      present such happy visions, that it seemed as though she were the divine\n      centre of all the harmonies of the world. All eyes were bent on her; the\n      other actors were obscured by her effulgence, and were not noticed. The\n      play continued, however.",
                "The prudent son of Laertes turned away his head, and hid his hand under\n      his mantle, in order to avoid the looks and kisses of the suppliant. The\n      virgin made a sign to him to fear nothing. Her tranquil gaze said --",
                "\"I follow you, Ulysses, and bow to necessity -- because I wish to die.\n      Daughter of Priam, and sister of Hector, my couch, which was once worthy\n      of Kings, shall never receive a foreign master. Freely do I quit the light\n      of day.\"",
                "Hecuba, lying motionless in the dust, suddenly rose and enfolded her\n      daughter in a last despairing embrace. Polyxena gently, but resolutely,\n      removed the old arms which held her. She seemed to say --",
                "\"Do not expose yourself, mother, to the fury of your master. Do not wait\n      until he drags you ignominiously on the ground in tearing me from your\n      arms. Better, O well-beloved mother, to give me your wrinkled hand, and\n      bend your hollow cheeks to my lips.\"",
                "The face of Thais looked beautiful in its grief. The crowd felt grateful\n      to her for showing them the forms and passions of life endowed with\n      superhuman grace, and Paphnutius pardoned her present splendour on account\n      of her coming humility, and glorified himself in advance for the saint he\n      was about to give to heaven.",
                "The drama neared its end. Hecuba fell as though dead, and Polyxena, led by\n      Ulysses, advanced towards the tomb, which was surrounded by the chief\n      warriors. A dirge was sung as she mounted the funeral pile, on the summit\n      of which the son of Achilles poured out libations from a gold cup to the\n      manes of the hero. When the sacrificing priests stretched out their arms\n      to seize her, she made a sign that she wished to die free and unbound, as\n      befitted the daughter of so many kings. Then, tearing aside her robe, she\n      bared her bosom to the blow. Pyrrhus, turning away his head, plunged his\n      sword into her heart, and by a skilful trick, the blood gushed forth over\n      the dazzling white breast of the virgin, who, with head thrown back, and\n      her eyes swimming in the horrors of death, fell with grace and modesty.",
                "Whilst the warriors enshrouded the victim with a veil, and covered her\n      with lilies and anemones, terrified screams and groans rent the air, and\n      Paphnutius, rising from his seat, prophesied in a loud voice.",

                "PART THE SECOND  --  THE PAPYRUS",
                "Thais was born of free, but poor, parents, who were idolaters. When she\n      was a very little girl, her father kept, at Alexandria, near the Gate of\n      the Moon, an inn, which was frequented by sailors. She still retained some\n      vivid, but disconnected, memories of her early youth. She remembered her\n      father, seated at the corner of the hearth with his legs crossed -- tall,\n      formidable, and quiet, like one of those old Pharaohs who are celebrated\n      in the ballads sung by blind men at the street corners. She remembered\n      also her thin, wretched mother, wandering like a hungry cat about the\n      house, which she filled with the tones of her sharp voice, and the glitter\n      of her phosphorescent eyes. They said in the neighbourhood that she was a\n      witch, and changed into an owl at night, and flew to see her lovers. It\n      was a lie. Thais knew well, having often watched her, that her mother\n      practised no magic arts, but that she was eaten up with avarice, and\n      counted all night the gains of the day. The idle father and the greedy\n      mother let the child live as best it could, like one of the fowls in the\n      poultry-yard. She became very clever in extracting, one by one, the oboli\n      from the belt of some drunken sailor, and in amusing the drinkers with\n      artless songs and obscene words, the meaning of which she did not know.\n      She passed from knee to knee, in a room reeking with the odours of\n      fermented drinks and resiny wine-skins; then, her cheeks sticky with beer\n      and pricked by rough beards, she escaped, clutching the oboli in her\n      little hand, and ran to buy honey-cakes from an old woman who crouched\n      behind her baskets under the Gate of the Moon. Every day the same scenes\n      were repeated, the sailors relating their perilous adventures, then\n      playing at dice or knuckle-bones, and blaspheming the gods, amid their\n      shouting for the best beer of Cilicia.",
                "Every night the child was awakened by the quarrels of the drunkards.\n      Oyster-shells would fly across the tables, cutting the heads of those they\n      hit, and the uproar was terrible. Sometimes she saw, by the light of the\n      smoky lamps, the knives glitter, and the blood flow.",
                "It humiliated her to think that the only person who showed her any human\n      kindness in her young days was the mild and gentle Ahmes. Ahmes, the\n      house-slave, a Nubian blacker than the pot he gravely skimmed, was as good\n      as a long night's sleep. Often he would take Thais on his knee, and tell\n      her old tales about underground treasure-houses constructed for avaricious\n      kings, who put to death the masons and architects. There were also tales\n      about clever thieves who married kings' daughters, and courtesans who\n      built pyramids. Little Thais loved Ahmes like a father, like a mother,\n      like a nurse, and like a dog. She followed the slave into the cellar when\n      he went to fill the amphorae, and into the poultry-yard amongst the\n      scraggy and ragged fowls, all beak, claws, and feathers, who flew swifter\n      than eagles before the knife of the black cook. Often at night, on the\n      straw, instead of sleeping, he built for Thais little water-mills, and\n      ships no bigger than his hand, with all their rigging.",
                "He had been badly treated by his masters; one of his ears was torn, and\n      his body covered with scars. Yet his features always wore an air of joyous\n      peace. And no one ever asked him whence he drew the consolation in his\n      soul, and the peace in his heart. He was as simple as a child. As he\n      performed his heavy tasks, he sang, in a harsh voice, hymns which made the\n      child tremble and dream. He murmured, in a gravely joyous tone --",
                "\"Tell us, Mary, what thou hast seen where thou hast been?\n     I saw the shroud and the linen cloths, and the angels\n     seated on the tomb.\n     And I saw the glory of the Risen One.\"",
                "She asked him --",
                "\"Father, why do you sing about angels seated on a tomb?\"",
                "And he replied --",
                "\"Little light of my eyes, I sing of the angels because Jesus, our Lord, is\n      risen to heaven.\"",
                "Ahmes was a Christian. He had been baptised, and was known as Theodore at\n      the meetings of the faithful, to which he went secretly during the hours\n      allowed him for sleep.",
                "At that time the Church was suffering the severest trials. By order of the\n      Emperor, the churches had been thrown down, the holy books burned, the\n      sacred vessels and candlesticks melted. The Christians had been deprived\n      of all their honours, and expected nothing but death. Terror reigned over\n      all the community at Alexandria, and the prisons were crammed with\n      victims. It was whispered with horror amongst the faithful, that in Syria,\n      in Arabia, in Mesopotamia, in Cappadocia, in all the empire, bishops and\n      virgins had been flogged, tortured, crucified or thrown to wild beasts.\n      Then Anthony, already celebrated for his visions and his solitary life, a\n      prophet, and the head of all the Egyptian believers, descended like an\n      eagle from his desert rock on the city of Alexandria, and, flying from\n      church to church, fired the whole community with his holy ardour.\n      Invisible to the pagans, he was present at the same time at all the\n      meetings of Christians, endowing all with the spirit of strength and\n      prudence by which he was animated. Slaves, in particular, were persecuted\n      with singular severity. Many of them, seized with fright, denied the\n      faith. Others, and by far the greater number, fled to the desert, hoping\n      to live there, either as hermits or robbers. Ahmes, however, frequented\n      the meetings as usual, visited the prisoners, buried the martyrs, and\n      joyfully professed the religion of Christ. The great Anthony, who saw his\n      unshaken zeal, before he returned into the desert, pressed the black slave\n      in his arms, and gave him the kiss of peace.",
                "When Thais was seven years old, Ahmes began to talk to her of God.",
                "\"The good Lord God,\" he said, \"lived in heaven like a Pharaoh, under the\n      tents of His harem, and under the trees of His gardens. He was the Ancient\n      of Ancients, and older than the world; and He had but one Son, the Prince\n      Jesus, whom He loved with all His heart, and who surpassed in beauty the\n      virgins and the angels. And the good Lord God said to Prince Jesus --",
                "\"'Leave My harem and My palace, and My date trees and My running waters.\n      Descend to earth for the welfare of men. There Thou shalt be like a little\n      child, and Thou shalt live poor amongst the poor. Suffering shall be Thy\n      daily bread, and Thou shalt weep so profusely that Thy tears shall form\n      rivers, in which the tired slave shall bathe with delight. Go, My Son!'",
                "\"Prince Jesus obeyed the good Lord, and He came down to earth, to a place\n      named Bethlehem of Judaea. And He walked in fields, amidst the flowering\n      anemones, saying to His companion --",
                "\"'Blessed are they who hunger, for I will lead them to My Father's table!\n      Blessed are they who thirst, for they shall drink of the fountains of\n      heaven! Blessed are they who weep, for I will dry their tears with veils\n      finer than those of the almehs!'",
                "\"That is why the poor loved Him, and believed in Him. But the rich hated\n      Him; fearing that He should raise the poor above them. At that time,\n      Cleopatra and Caesar were powerful on the earth. They both hated Jesus,\n      and they ordered the judges and priests to put Him to death. To obey the\n      Queen of Egypt, the princes of Syria erected a cross on a high mountain,\n      and they caused Jesus to die on this cross. But women washed His corpse,\n      and buried it; and Prince Jesus, having broken the door of His tomb, rose\n      again to the good Lord, His Father.",
                "\"And, from that time, all those who believed in Him go to heaven.",
                "\"The Lord God opens His arms, and says to them --",
                "\"'Ye are welcome, because ye love the Prince, My Son. Wash, and then eat.'",
                "\"They bathe to the sound of beautiful music, and, all the time they are\n      eating, they see almehs dancing, and they listen to tales that never end.\n      They are dearer to the good Lord God than the light of His eyes, because\n      they are His guests, and they shall have for their portion the carpets of\n      His house, and the pomegranates of His gardens.\"",
                "Ahmes often spoke in this strain, and thus taught the truth to Thais. She\n      wondered, and said --",
                "\"I should like to eat the pomegranates of the good Lord.\"",
                "Ahmes replied --",
                "\"Only those who are baptised may taste the fruits of heaven.\"",
                "And Thais asked to be baptised. Seeing by this that she believed in Jesus,\n      the slave resolved to instruct her more fully, so that, being baptised,\n      she might enter the Church; and he loved her as his spiritual daughter.",
                "The child, unloved and uncared for by its selfish parents, had no bed in\n      the house. She slept in a corner of the stable amongst the domestic\n      animals, and there Ahmes came to her every night secretly.",
                "He gently approached the mat on which she lay, and sat down on his heels,\n      his legs bent and his body straight -- a position hereditary to his\n      race. His face and his body, which was clothed in black, were invisible in\n      the darkness; but his big white eyes shone out, and there came from them a\n      light like a ray of dawn through the chinks of a door. He spoke in a\n      husky, monotonous tone, with a slight nasal twang that gave it the soft\n      melody of music heard at night in the streets. Sometimes the breathing of\n      an ass, or the soft lowing of an ox, accompanied, like a chorus of\n      invisible spirits, the voice of the slave as he recited the gospels. His\n      words flowed gently in the darkness, which they filled with zeal, mercy,\n      and hope; and the neophyte, her hand in that of Ahmes, lulled by the\n      monotonous sounds, and the vague visions in her mind, slept calm and\n      smiling, amid the harmonies of the dark night and the holy mysteries,\n      gazed down on by a star, which twinkled between the joists of the\n      stable-roof.",
                "The initiation lasted a whole year, till the time when the Christians\n      joyfully celebrate the festival of Easter. One night in the holy week,\n      Thais, who was already asleep on her mat, felt herself lifted by the\n      slave, whose eyes gleamed with a strange light. He was clad, not as usual\n      in a pair of torn drawers, but in a long white cloak, beneath which he\n      pressed the child, whispering to her --",
                "\"Come, my soul! Come, light of my eyes! Come, little sweetheart! Come and\n      be clad in the baptismal robes!\"",
                "He carried the child pressed to his breast. Frightened and yet curious,\n      Thais, her head out of the cloak, threw her arms round her friend's neck,\n      and he ran with her through the darkness. They went down narrow, black\n      alleys; they passed through the Jews' quarter; they skirted a cemetery,\n      where the osprey uttered its dismal cry; they traversed an open space,\n      passing under crosses on which hung the bodies of victims, and on the arms\n      of the crosses the ravens clacked their beaks. Thais hid her head in the\n      slave's breast. She did not dare to peep out all the rest of the way. Soon\n      it seemed to her that she was going down under ground. When she reopened\n      her eyes she found herself in a narrow cave, lighted by resin torches, on\n      the walls of which were painted standing figures, which seemed to move and\n      live in the flickering glare of the torches. They were men clad in long\n      tunics and carrying branches of palm, and around them were lambs, doves,\n      and tendrils of vine.",
                "Amongst these figures, Thais recognised Jesus of Nazareth, by the anemones\n      flowering at his feet. In the centre of the cave, near a large stone font\n      filled with water, stood an old man clad in a scarlet dalmatic embroidered\n      with gold, and on his head a low mitre. His thin face ended in a long\n      beard. He looked gentle and humble, in spite of his rich costume. This was\n      Bishop Vivantius, an exiled dignitary of the Church of Cyrene, who now\n      gained his livelihood by weaving common stuffs of goats' hair. Two poor\n      children stood by his side. Close by, an old negress unfolded a little\n      white robe. Ahmes set the child down on the ground, and kneeling before\n      the Bishop, said --",
                "\"Father, this is the little soul, the child of my soul. I have brought her\n      that you may, according to your promise, and if it please your holiness,\n      bestow on her the baptism of life.\"",
                "At these words the Bishop opened his arms, and showed his mutilated hands.\n      His nails had been torn out because he had maintained the faith in the\n      days of persecution. Thais was frightened, and threw herself into the arms\n      of Ahmes. But the kind words of the priest reassured her.",
                "\"Fear nothing, dearly beloved little one. Thou hast here a spiritual\n      father, Ahmes, who is called Theodore amongst the faithful, and a kind\n      mother in grace, who has prepared for thee, with her own hands, a white\n      robe.\"",
                "And turning towards the negress --",
                "\"She is called Nitida,\" he added, \"and is a slave in this world, but in\n      heaven she will be a spouse of Jesus.\"",
                "Then he said to the child neophyte --",
                "\"Thais, dost thou believe in God, the Father Almighty; and in His only\n      Son, who died for our salvation; and in all that the apostles taught?\"",
                "\"Yes,\" replied together the negro and negress, who held her by each hand.",
                "By the Bishop's orders, Nitida knelt down and undressed Thais. The child\n      was quite naked; round her neck was an amulet. The Pontiff plunged her\n      three times into the baptismal font. The acolytes brought the oil, with\n      which Vivantius anointed the catechumen, and the salt, a morsel of which\n      he placed on her tongue. Then, having dried that body which was destined,\n      after many trials, to life immortal, the slave Nitida put on Thais the\n      white robe she had woven.",
                "The Bishop gave to each and all the kiss of peace, and, the ceremony being\n      terminated, took off his sacerdotal insignia.",
                "When they had left the crypt, Ahmes said --",
                "\"We ought to rejoice that we have this day brought a soul to the good Lord\n      God; let us go to the house of your Holiness and spend the rest of the\n      night in rejoicing.\"",
                "\"Thou hast well said, Theodore,\" replied the Bishop, and he led the little\n      band to his house, which was quite near. It consisted of a single room,\n      furnished with a couple of looms, a heavy table, and a worn-out carpet. As\n      soon as they had entered,",
                "\"Nitida,\" cried the Nubian, \"bring hither the stove and the jar of oil,\n      and we will have a good supper.\"",
                "Saying thus, he drew from under his cloak some little fish which he had\n      kept concealed, and lighted a fire and fried them. The Bishop, the girl,\n      the two boys, and the two slaves sat in a ring on the carpet, ate the\n      fried fish, and blessed the Lord. Vivantius spoke of the torture he had\n      undergone, and prophesied the speedy triumph of the Church. His language\n      was grotesque, and full of word-play and rhetorical tropes. He compared\n      the life of the just to a tissue of purple, and to explain the mystery of\n      baptism, he said --",
                "\"The Divine Spirit floated on the waters, and that is why Christians\n      receive the baptism of water. But demons also inhabit the brooks; springs\n      consecrated to nymphs are especially dangerous, and there are certain\n      waters which cause various maladies, both of the soul and of the body.\"",
                "Sometimes he spoke enigmatically, and the child listened to him with\n      profound awe and wonder. At the end of the repast he offered his guests a\n      little wine, and this unloosed their tongues, and they began to sing\n      lamentations and hymns. Ahmes and Nitida then rose, and danced a Nubian\n      dance which they had learned as children, and which, no doubt, had been\n      danced by their tribe since the early ages of the world. It was a love\n      dance; waving their arms, and moving their bodies in rhythmic measure,\n      they feigned, in turn, to fly from and to pursue each other. Their big\n      eyes rolled, and they showed their gleaming teeth in broad grins.",
                "In this strange manner did Thais receive the holy rite of baptism.",
                "She loved amusements, and, as she grew, vague desires were created in her\n      mind. All day long she danced and sang with the children in the streets,\n      and when at night she returned to her father's house, she was still\n      singing --",
                "\"Crooked twist, why do you stay in the house? I comb the wool, and the\n      Miletan threads. Crooked twist, what did your son die of? He fell from the\n      white horses into the sea.\"",
                "She now began to prefer the company of boys and girls to that of the\n      gentle and quiet Ahmes. She did not notice that her friend was not so\n      often with her. The persecution having relented, the Christians were able\n      to assemble more regularly, and the Nubian frequented these meetings\n      assiduously. His zeal increased, and he sometimes uttered mysterious\n      threats. He said that the rich would not keep their wealth. He went to the\n      public places to which the poorer Christians used to resort, and\n      assembling together all the poor wretches who were lying in the shade of\n      the old walls, he announced to them that all slaves would soon be free,\n      and that the day of justice was at hand.",
                "\"In the kingdom of God,\" he said, \"the slaves will drink new wine and eat\n      delicious fruits; whilst the rich, crouching at their feet like dogs, will\n      devour the crumbs from their table.\"",
                "These sayings were noised abroad through all that quarter of the city, and\n      the masters feared that Ahmes might incite the slaves to revolt. The\n      innkeeper hated him intensely, though he carefully concealed his rancour.",
                "One day, a silver salt-cellar, reserved for the table of the gods,\n      disappeared from the inn. Ahmes was accused of having stolen it -- out\n      of hate to his master and to the gods of the empire. There was no proof of\n      the accusation, and the slave vehemently denied the charge. Nevertheless,\n      he was dragged before the tribunal, and as he had the reputation of being\n      a bad servant, the judge condemned him to death.",
                "\"As you did not know how to make a good use of your hands,\" he said, \"they\n      will be nailed to the cross.\"",
                "Ahmes heard the verdict quietly, bowed to the judge most respectfully, and\n      was taken to the public prison. During the three days that remained to\n      him, he did not cease to preach the gospel to the prisoners, and it was\n      related afterwards that the criminals, and the gaoler himself, touched by\n      his words, believed in Jesus crucified.",
                "He was taken to the very place which one night, less than two years\n      before, he had crossed so joyfully, carrying in his cloak little Thais,\n      the daughter of his soul, his darling flower. When his hands were nailed\n      to the cross, he uttered no complaint, but many times he sighed and\n      murmured, \"I thirst.\"",
                "His agony lasted three days and three nights. It seemed hardly possible\n      that human flesh could have endured such prolonged torture. Many times it\n      was thought he was dead; the flies clustered on his eyelids, but suddenly\n      he would reopen his bloodshot eyes. On the morning of the fourth day, he\n      sang, in a voice clearer and purer than that of a child --",
                "\"Tell us, Mary, what thou hast seen where thou hast been?\"",
                "Then he smiled and said --",
                "\"They come, the angels of the good Lord. They bring me wine and fruit. How\n      refreshing is the fanning of their wings!\"",
                "And he expired.",
                "His features preserved in death an expression of ecstatic happiness. Even\n      the soldiers who guarded the cross were struck with wonder. Vivantius,\n      accompanied by some of the Christian brethren, claimed the body, and\n      buried it with the remains of the other martyrs in the crypt of St. John\n      the Baptist, and the Church venerated the memory of Saint Theodore the\n      Nubian.",
                "Three years later, Constantine, the conquerer of Maxentius, issued an\n      edict which granted toleration to the Christians, and the believers were\n      not henceforth persecuted, except by heretics.",
                "Thais had completed her eleventh year when her friend was tortured to\n      death, and she felt deeply saddened and shocked. Her soul was not\n      sufficiently pure to allow her to understand that the slave Ahmes was\n      blessed both in his life and his death. The idea sprang up in her little\n      mind that no one can be good in this world except at the cost of the most\n      terrible sufferings. And she was afraid to be good, for her delicate flesh\n      could not bear pain.",
                "At an early age, she had given herself to the lads about the port, and she\n      followed the old men who wandered about the quarter in the evening, and\n      with what she received from them she bought cakes and trinkets.",
                "As she did not take home any of the money she gained, her mother\n      continually ill-treated her. To get out of reach of her mother's arm, she\n      often ran, bare-footed, to the city walls, and hid with the lizards. There\n      she thought with envy of the ladies she had seen pass her, richly dressed,\n      and in a litter surrounded by slaves.",
                "One day, when she had been beaten more brutally than usual, she was\n      crouching down beside the gate, motionless and sulky, when an old woman\n      stopped in front of her, looked at her for some moments in silence, and\n      then cried --",
                "\"Oh, the pretty flower! the beautiful child! Happy is the father who begot\n      thee, and the mother who brought thee into the world!\"",
                "Thais remained silent, with her eyes fixed on the ground. Her eyelids were\n      red, and it was evident she had been weeping.",
                "\"My white violet,\" continued the old woman, \"is not your mother happy to\n      have nourished a little goddess like you, and does not your father, when\n      he sees you, rejoice from the bottom of his heart?\"",
                "To which the child replied, as though talking to herself --",
                "\"My father is a wine-skin swollen with wine, and my mother a greedy\n      horse-leech.\"",
                "The old woman glanced to right and left, to see if she were observed.\n      Then, in a fawning voice --",
                "\"Sweet flowering hyacinth, beautiful drinker of light, come with me, and\n      you shall have nothing to do but dance and smile. I will feed you on honey\n      cakes, and my son -- my own son -- will love you as his eyes. My son\n      is handsome and young; he has but little beard on his chin; his skin is\n      soft, and he is, as they say, a little Acharnian pig.\"",
                "Thais replied --",
                "\"I am quite willing to go with you.\"",
                "And she rose and followed the old woman out of the city.",
                "The old woman, who was named Moeroe, went from city to city with a troupe\n      of girls and boys, whom she taught to dance, and then hired out to rich\n      people to appear at feasts.",
                "Guessing that Thais would soon develop into a most beautiful woman, she\n      taught her -- with the help of a whip -- music and prosody, and she\n      flogged with leather thongs those beautiful legs, when they did not move\n      in time to the strains of the cithara. Her son -- a decrepit abortion,\n      of no age and no sex -- ill-treated the child, on whom he vented the\n      hate he had for all womankind. Like the dancing-girls whose grace he\n      affected, he knew, and taught Thais, the art of pantomime, and how to\n      mimic, by expression, gesture, and attitude, all human passions, and more\n      especially the passions of love. He was a clever master, though he\n      disliked his work; but he was jealous of his pupil, and as soon as he\n      discovered that she was born to give men pleasure, he scratched her\n      cheeks, pinched her arms, or pricked her legs, as a spiteful girl would\n      have done. Thanks, however, to his lessons, she quickly became an\n      excellent musician, pantomimist, and dancer. The brutality of her master\n      did not at all surprise her; it seemed natural to her to be badly treated.\n      She even felt some respect for the old woman, who knew music and drank\n      Greek wine. Moeroe, when she came to Antioch, praised her pupil to the\n      rich merchants of the city who gave banquets, both as a dancer and a\n      flute-player. Thais danced and pleased. She accompanied the rich bankers,\n      when they left the table, into the shady groves on the banks of the\n      Orontes. She gave herself to all, for she knew nothing of the price of\n      love. But one night that she had danced before the most fashionable young\n      men of the city, the son of the pro-consul came to her, radiant with youth\n      and pleasure, and said, in a voice that seemed redolent of kisses --",
                "\"Why am I not, Thais, the wreath which crowns your hair, the tunic which\n      enfolds your beautiful form, the sandal on your pretty foot? I wish you to\n      tread me under foot as a sandal; I wish my caresses to be your tunic and\n      your wreath. Come, sweet girl! come to my house, and let us forget the\n      world.\"",
                "She looked at him whilst he was speaking, and saw that he was handsome.\n      Suddenly she felt a cold sweat on her face. She turned green as grass; she\n      reeled; a cloud descended before her eyes. He again implored her to come\n      with him, but she refused. His ardent looks, his burning words were vain,\n      and when he took her in his arms to try and drag her away, she pushed him\n      off rudely. Then he implored her, and shed tears. But a new, unknown, and\n      invincible passion dominated her heart, and she still resisted.",
                "\"What madness!\" said the guests. \"Lollius is noble, handsome, and rich,\n      and a dancing-girl treats him with scorn!\"",
                "Lollius returned home alone that night, quite love-sick. He came in the\n      morning, pale and red-eyed, and hung flowers at the dancing-girl's door.",
                "But Thais was frightened and troubled; she avoided Lollius, and yet he was\n      continually in her mind. She suffered, and she did not know the cause of\n      her complaint. She wondered why she had thus changed, and why she was\n      melancholy. She recoiled from all her lovers; they were hateful to her.\n      She loathed the light of day, and lay on her bed all day, sobbing, and\n      with her head buried in the pillows. Lollius contrived to gain admittance,\n      and came many times, but neither his pleadings nor his execrations had any\n      effect on the obdurate girl. In his presence, she was as timid as a\n      virgin, and would say nothing but --",
                "\"I will not! I will not!\"",
                "But at the end of a fortnight she gave in, for she knew that she loved\n      him; she went to his house and lived with him. They were supremely happy.\n      They passed their days shut up together, gazing into each other's eyes,\n      and babbling a childish jargon. In the evening, they walked on the lonely\n      banks of the Orontes, and lost themselves in the laurel woods. Sometimes\n      they rose at dawn, to go and gather hyacinths on the slopes of Sulpicus.\n      They drank from the same cup, and he would take a grape from between her\n      lips with his mouth.",
                "Moeroe came to Lollius, and cried and shrieked that Thais should be\n      restored to her.",
                "\"She is my daughter,\" she said, \"my daughter, who has been torn from me.\n      My perfumed flower -- my own bowels -- !\"",
                "Lollius gave her a large sum of money, and sent her away. But, as she came\n      back to demand some more gold staters, the young man had her put in\n      prison, and the magistrates having discovered that she was guilty of many\n      crimes, she was condemned to death, and thrown to the wild beasts.",
                "Thais loved Lollius with all the passion of her mind, and the bewilderment\n      of innocence. She told him, and told him truly from the bottom of her\n      heart --",
                "\"I have never loved any one but you.\"",
                "Lollius replied --",
                "\"You are not like any other woman.\"",
                "The spell lasted six months, but it broke at last. Thais suddenly felt\n      that her heart was empty and lonely. Lollius no longer seemed the same to\n      her. She thought --",
                "\"What can have thus changed me in an instant? How is it that he is now\n      like any other man, and no longer like himself?\"",
                "She left him, not without a secret desire to find Lollius again in\n      another, as she no longer found him in himself. She thought it would be\n      less dull to live with someone she had never loved, than with one she had\n      ceased to love. She appeared, in the company of rich debauchees, at those\n      sacred feasts at which naked virgins danced in the temples, and troops of\n      courtesans swam across the Orontes. She took part in all the pleasures of\n      the fashionable and depraved city; and she assiduously frequented the\n      theatres, at which clever mimes from all countries performed amidst the\n      applause of a crowd greedy for excitement.",
                "She carefully observed the mimes, dancers, comedians, and especially the\n      women, who in tragedies represented goddesses in love with young men, or\n      mortals loved by the gods. Having discovered the secrets by which they\n      pleased the audience, she thought to herself that she was more beautiful\n      and could act better. She went to the manager, and asked to be admitted\n      into the troupe. Thanks to her beauty, and to the lessons she had received\n      from old Moeroe, she was received, and appeared on the stage in the part\n      of Dirce.",
                "She met with but indifferent success, for she was inexperienced, and the\n      admiration of the spectators had not been aroused by hearing her praises\n      sung. But after she had played small parts for a few months, the power of\n      her beauty burst forth with such effect that all the city was moved. All\n      Antioch crowded to the theatre. The imperial magistrates and the chief\n      citizens were compelled, by the force of public opinion, to show\n      themselves there. The porters, sweepers, and dock labourers went without\n      bread and garlic, that they might pay for their places. Poets composed\n      epigrams in her honour. Bearded philosophers inveighed against her in the\n      baths and gymnasia; when her litter passed, Christian priests turned away\n      their heads. The threshold of her door was wreathed with flowers, and\n      sprinkled with blood. She received so much money from her lovers that it\n      was no longer counted, but measured by the medimnus, and all the treasure\n      hoarded by miserly old men was poured out at her feet. But she was placid\n      and unmoved. She rejoiced, with quiet pride, in the admiration of the\n      public and the favour of the gods, and was so much loved that she loved\n      herself.",
                "After she had several years enjoyed the admiration and affection of the\n      Antiochians, she was taken with a desire to revisit Alexandria, and show\n      her glory in that city in which, as a child, she had wandered in want and\n      shame, hungry and lean as a grasshopper in the middle of a dusty road. The\n      golden city joyfully welcomed her, and loaded her with fresh riches; when\n      she appeared in the games it was a triumph. Countless admirers and lovers\n      came to her. She received them with indifference, for she at last\n      despaired of meeting another Lollius.",
                "Amongst many others, she met the philosopher Nicias, who desired to\n      possess her, although he professed to have no desires. In spite of his\n      riches, he was intelligent and modest. But his delicate wit and beautiful\n      sentiments failed to charm her. She did not love him and sometimes his\n      refined irony even irritated her. His perpetual doubts hurt her, for he\n      believed in nothing, and she believed in everything. She believed in\n      divine providence, in the omnipotence of evil spirits, in spells,\n      exorcisms, and eternal justice; she believed in Jesus Christ, and in the\n      goddess of good of the Syrians; she believed also that bitches barked when\n      black Hecate passed through the streets, and that a woman could inspire\n      love by pouring a philtre into a cup wrapped in the bleeding skin of a\n      sheep. She thirsted for the unknown; she called on nameless gods, and\n      lived in perpetual expectation. The future frightened her, and yet she\n      wished to know it. She surrounded herself with priests of Isis, Chaldean\n      magi, pharmacopolists, and professors of the black arts, who invariably\n      deceived her, though she never tired of being deceived. She feared death,\n      and she saw it everywhere. When she yielded to pleasure, it seemed to her\n      that an icy finger would suddenly touch her on the bare shoulder, and she\n      turned pale, and cried with terror, in the arms which embraced her.",
                "Nicias said to her --",
                "\"What does it matter, O my Thais, whether we descend to eternal night with\n      white locks and hollow cheeks, or, whether this very day, now laughing to\n      the vast sky, shall be our last? Let us enjoy life; we shall have greatly\n      lived if we have greatly loved. There is no knowledge except that of the\n      senses; to love is to understand. That which we do not know does not\n      exist. What good is it to worry ourselves about nothing?\"",
                "She replied angrily --",
                "\"I despise men like you, who hope for nothing and fear nothing. I wish to\n      know! I wish to know!\"",
                "In order to understand the secret of life, she set to work to read the\n      books of the philosophers, but she did not understand them. The further\n      the years of her childhood receded from her, the more anxious she was to\n      recall them. She loved to traverse at night, in disguise, the alleys,\n      squares, and places where she had grown up so miserably. She was sorry she\n      had lost her parents, and especially that she had not been able to love\n      them. When she met any Christian priest, she thought of her baptism, and\n      felt troubled. One night, when enveloped in a long cloak, and her fair\n      hair hidden under a black hood, she was wandering, according to custom,\n      about the suburbs of the city, she found herself -- without knowing how\n      she came there -- before the poor little church of St. John the\n      Baptist. They were singing inside the church, and a bright light glimmered\n      through the chinks of the door. There was nothing strange in that, as, for\n      the past twenty years, the Christians, protected by the conqueror of\n      Maxentius, had publicly solemnised their festivals. But these hymns seemed\n      more like an ardent appeal to the soul. As if she had been invited to the\n      mysteries, she pushed the door open with her arm, and entered the\n      building. She found a numerous assembly of women, children, and old men,\n      on their knees before a tomb, which stood against the wall. The tomb was\n      nothing but a stone coffer, roughly sculptured with vine tendrils and\n      bunches of grapes; yet it had received great honours, and was covered with\n      green palms and wreaths of red roses. All round, innumerable lights\n      gleamed out of the heavy shadow, in which the smoke of Arabian gums seemed\n      like the folds of angels' robes, and the paintings on the walls visions of\n      Paradise. Priests, clad in white, were prostrate at the foot of the\n      sarcophagus. The hymns they sang with the people expressed the delight of\n      suffering, and mingled, in a triumphal mourning, so much joy with so much\n      grief, that Thais, in listening to them, felt the pleasures of life and\n      the terrors of death flowing, at the same time, through her re-awakened\n      senses.",
                "When they had finished singing, the believers rose, and walked in single\n      file to the tomb, the side of which they kissed. They were common men,\n      accustomed to work with their hands. They advanced with a heavy step, the\n      eyes fixed, the jaw dropped, but they had an air of sincerity. They knelt\n      down, each in turn, before the sarcophagus, and put their lips to it. The\n      women lifted their little children in their arms, and gently placed their\n      cheek to the stone.",
                "Thais, surprised and troubled, asked a deacon why they did so.",
                "\"Do you not know, woman,\" replied the deacon, \"that we celebrate to-day\n      the blessed memory of St. Theodore the Nubian, who suffered for the faith\n      in the days of the Emperor Diocletian? He lived virtuously and died a\n      martyr, and that is why, robed in white, we bear red roses to his glorious\n      tomb.\"",
                "On hearing these words, Thais fell on her knees, and burst into tears.\n      Half-forgotten recollections of Ahmes returned to her mind. On the memory\n      of this obscure, gentle, and unfortunate man, the blaze of candles, the\n      perfume of roses, the clouds of incense, the music of hymns, the piety of\n      souls, threw all the charms of glory. Thais thought in the dazzling glare --",
                "\"He was good, and now he has become great and glorious. Why is it that he\n      is elevated above other men? What is this unknown thing which is more than\n      riches or pleasure?\"",
                "She rose slowly, and turned towards the tomb of the saint who had loved\n      her, those violet eyes, now filled with tears which glittered in the\n      candle-light; then, with bowed head, humble, slow, and the last, with\n      those lips on which so many desires hung, she kissed the stone of the\n      slave's tomb.",
                "When she returned to her house, she found Nicias, who, with his hair\n      perfumed, and his tunic thrown open, was reading a treatise on morals\n      whilst waiting for her. He advanced with open arms.",
                "\"Naughty Thais,\" he said, in a laughing voice, \"whilst I was waiting for\n      you to come, do you know what I saw in this manuscript, written by the\n      gravest of Stoics? Precepts of virtue and noble maxims: No! On the staid\n      papyrus, I saw dance thousands and thousands of little Thaises. Each was\n      no bigger than my finger, and yet their grace was infinite, and all were\n      the only Thais. There were some who flaunted in mantles of purple and\n      gold; others, like a white cloud, floated in the air in transparent\n      drapery. Others again, motionless and divinely nude, the better to inspire\n      pleasure, expressed no thought. Lastly, there were two, hand in hand; two\n      so alike that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. Both\n      smiled. The first said, 'I am love.' The other, 'I am death.'\"",
                "Thus speaking, he pressed Thais in his arms, and not noticing the sullen\n      look in her downcast eyes, he went on adding thought to thought, heedless\n      of the fact that they were all lost upon her.",
                "\"Yes, when I had before my eyes the line in which it was written, 'Nothing\n      should deter you from improving your mind,' I read, 'The kisses of Thais\n      are warmer than fire, and sweeter than honey.' That is how a philosopher\n      reads the books of other philosophers -- and that is your fault, you\n      naughty child. It is true that, as long as we are what we are, we shall\n      never find anything but our own thoughts in the thoughts of others, and\n      that all of us are somewhat inclined to read books as I have read this\n      one.\"",
                "She did not hear him; her soul was still before the Nubian's tomb. As he\n      heard her sigh, he kissed her on the neck, and said --",
                "\"Do not be sad, my child. We are never happy in this world, except when we\n      forget the world.",
                "\"Come, let us cheat life -- it is sure to take its revenge. Come, let\n      us love!\"",
                "But she pushed him away.",
                "\"We love!\" she cried bitterly. \"You never loved any one. And\n      I do not love you! No! I do not love you! I hate you! Go! I\n      hate you! I curse and despise all who are happy, and all who are rich! Go!\n      Go! Goodness is only found amongst the unfortunate. When I was a child I\n      knew a black slave who died on the cross. He was good; he was filled with\n      love, and he knew the secret of life. You are not worthy to wash his feet.\n      Go! I never wish to see you again!\"",
                "She threw herself on her face on the carpet, and passed the night sobbing\n      and weeping, and forming resolutions to live, in future, like Saint\n      Theodore, in poverty and humbleness.",
                "The next day, she devoted herself again to those pleasures to which she\n      was addicted. As she knew that her beauty, though still intact, would not\n      last very long, she hastened to derive all the enjoyment and all the fame\n      she could from it. At the theatre, where she acted and studied more than\n      ever, she gave life to the imagination of sculptors, painters, and poets.\n      Recognising that there was in the attitudes, movements, and walk of the\n      actress, an idea of the divine harmony which rules the spheres, wise men\n      and philosophers considered that such perfect grace was a virtue in\n      itself, and said, \"Thais also is a geometrician!\" The ignorant, the poor,\n      the humble, and the timid before whom she consented to appear, regarded\n      her as a blessing from heaven. Yet she was sad amidst all the praise she\n      received, and dreaded death more than ever. Nothing was able to set her\n      mind at rest, not even her house and gardens, which were celebrated, and a\n      proverb throughout the city.",
                "The gardens were planted with trees, brought at great expense from India\n      and Persia. They were watered by a running brook, and colonnades in ruins,\n      and imitation rocks, arranged by a skilful artist, were reflected in a\n      lake, which also mirrored the statues that stood round it. In the middle\n      of the garden was the Grotto of Nymphs, which owed its name to three\n      life-size figures of women, which stood on the threshold. They were\n      represented as divesting themselves of their garments, and about to bathe.\n      They anxiously turned their heads, fearing to be seen, and looked as\n      though they were alive. The only light which entered the building came,\n      tempered and iridescent, through thin sheets of water. All the walls were\n      hung -- as in the sacred grottoes -- with wreaths, garlands, and\n      votive pictures, in which the beauty of Thais was celebrated. There were\n      also tragic and comic masks, bright with colours; and paintings\n      representing theatrical scenes or grotesque figures, or fabulous animals.\n      On a stele in the centre stood a little ivory Eros of wonderful antique\n      workmanship. It was a gift from Nicias. In one of the bays was a figure of\n      a goat in black marble, with shining agate eyes. Six alabaster kids\n      crowded round its teats; but, raising its cloven hoofs and its ugly head,\n      it seemed impatient to climb the rocks. The floor was covered with\n      Byzantine carpets, pillows embroidered by the yellow men of Cathay, and\n      the skins of Libyan lions. Perfumed smoke arose from golden censers.\n      Flowering plants grew in large onyx vases. And at the far end, in the\n      purple shadow, gleamed the gold nails on the shell of a huge Indian\n      tortoise turned upside down, which served as the bed of the actress. It\n      was here that every day, to the murmur of the water, and amid perfumes and\n      flowers, Thais reclined softly, and conversed with her friends, while\n      awaiting the hour of supper, or meditated in solitude on theatrical art,\n      or on the flight of years.",
                "On the afternoon after the games, Thais was reposing in the Grotto of\n      Nymphs. She had noticed in her mirror the first signs of the decay of her\n      beauty, and she was frightened to think that white hair and wrinkles would\n      at last come. She vainly tried to comfort herself with the assurance that\n      she could recover her fresh complexion by burning certain herbs and\n      pronouncing a few magic words. A pitiless voice cried, \"You will grow old\n      Thais; you will grow old.\" And a cold sweat of terror bedewed her\n      forehead. Then, on looking at herself again in the mirror with infinite\n      tenderness, she found that she was still beautiful and worthy to be loved.\n      She smiled to herself, and murmured, \"There is not a woman in Alexandria\n      who can rival me in suppleness or grace or movement, or in splendour of\n      arms, and the arms, my mirror, are the real chains of love!\"",
                "While she was thus thinking she saw an unknown man -- thin, with\n      burning eyes and unkempt beard, and clad in a richly embroidered robe -- standing\n      before her. She let fall her mirror, and uttered a cry of fright.",
                "Paphnutius stood motionless, and seeing how beautiful she was, he murmured\n      this prayer from the bottom of his heart --",
                "\"Grant, my God, that the face of this woman may not be a temptation, but\n      may prove salutary to Thy servant.\"",
                "Then, forcing himself to speak, he said --",
                "\"Thais, I live in a far country, and the fame of thy beauty has led me to\n      thee. It is said that thou art the most clever of actresses and the most\n      irresistible of women. That which is related of thy riches and thy love\n      affairs seems fabulous, and calls to mind the old story of Rhodope, whose\n      marvellous history is known by heart to all the boatmen on the Nile.\n      Therefore I was seized with a desire to know thee, and I see that the\n      truth surpasses the rumour. Thou art a thousand times more clever and more\n      beautiful than is reported. And now that I see thee, I say to myself, 'It\n      is impossible to approach her without staggering like a drunken man.'\"",
                "The words were feigned; but the monk, animated by pious zeal, uttered them\n      with real warmth. Thais gazed, without displeasure, at this strange being\n      who had frightened her. The rough, wild aspect, and the fiery glances of\n      his eyes, astonished her. She was curious to learn the state of life of a\n      man so different from all others she had met. She replied, with gentle\n      raillery --",
                "\"You seem prompt to admire, stranger. Beware that my looks do not consume\n      you to the bones! Beware of loving me!\"",
                "He said --",
                "\"I love thee, O Thais! I love thee more than my life, and more than\n      myself. For thee I have quitted the desert; for thee my lips -- vowed\n      to silence -- have pronounced profane words; for thee I have seen what\n      I ought not to have seen, and heard what it was forbidden to me to hear;\n      for thee my soul is troubled, my heart is open, and the thoughts gush out\n      like the running springs at which the pigeons drink; for thee I have\n      walked day and night across sandy deserts teeming with reptiles and\n      vampires; for thee I have placed my bare foot on vipers and scorpions!\n      Yes, I love thee! I love thee, but not like those men who, burning with\n      the lusts of the flesh, come to thee like devouring wolves or furious\n      bulls. Thou art dear to them as is the gazelle to the lion. Their ravening\n      lusts will consume thee to the soul, O woman! I love thee in spirit and in\n      truth; I love thee in God, and for ever and ever; that which is in my\n      breast is named true zeal and divine charity. I promise thee better things\n      than drunkenness crowned with flowers or the dreams of a brief night. I\n      promise thee holy feasts and celestial suppers. The happiness that I bring\n      thee will never end; it is unheard-of, it is ineffable, and such that if\n      the happy of this world could only see a shadow of it they would die of\n      wonder.\"",
                "Thais laughed mischievously.",
                "\"Friend,\" she said, \"show me this wonderful love. Make haste! Long\n      speeches would be an insult to my beauty; let us not lose a moment. I am\n      impatient to taste the felicity you announce; but, to say the truth, I\n      fear that I shall always remain ignorant of it, and that all you have\n      promised me will vanish in words. It is easier to promise a great\n      happiness than to give it. Everyone has a talent of some sort. I fancy\n      that yours is to make long speeches. You speak of an unknown love. It is\n      so long since kisses were first exchanged that it would be very\n      extraordinary if there still remained secrets in love. On this subject\n      lovers know more than philosophers.\"",
                "\"Do not jest, Thais. I bring thee the unknown love.\"",
                "\"Friend, you come too late. I know every kind of love.\"",
                "\"The love that I bring thee abounds with glory, whilst the loves that thou\n      knowest breed only shame.\"",
                "Thais looked at him with an angry eye, a frown gathered on her beautiful\n      face.",
                "\"You are very bold, stranger, to offend your hostess. Look at me, and say\n      if I resemble a creature crushed down with shame. No, I am not ashamed,\n      and all others who live like me are not ashamed either, although they are\n      not so beautiful or so rich as I am. I have sown pleasure in my footsteps,\n      and I am celebrated for that all over the world. I am more powerful than\n      the masters of the world. I have seen them at my feet. Look at me, look at\n      these little feet; thousands of men would pay with their blood for the\n      happiness of kissing them. I am not very big, and I do not occupy much\n      space on the earth. To those who look at me from the top of the Serapeium,\n      when I pass in the street, I look like a grain of rice; but that grain of\n      rice has caused among men, griefs, despairs, hates, and crimes enough to\n      have filled Tartarus. Are you not mad to talk to me of shame when all\n      around proclaims my glory?\"",
                "\"That which is glory in the eyes of men, is infamy before God. O woman, we\n      have been nourished in countries so different, that it is not surprising\n      we have neither the same language nor the same thoughts! Yet Heaven is my\n      witness that I wish to agree with thee, and that it is my intention not to\n      leave thee until we share the same sentiments. Who will inspire me with\n      burning words that will melt thee like wax in my breath, O woman, that the\n      fingers of my desires may mould thee as they wish? What virtue will\n      deliver thee to me, O dearest of souls, that the spirit which animates me,\n      creating thee a second time, may imprint on thee a fresh beauty, and that\n      thou mayest cry, weeping for joy, 'It is only now that I am born'? Who\n      will cause to gush in my heart a fount of Siloam, in which thou mayest\n      bathe and recover thy first purity? Who will change me into a Jordan, the\n      waves of which sprinkled on thee, will give thee life eternal?\"",

No doubt he is a mage, and knows secret charms\n      against old age and death,\" and she resolved to offer herself to him.\n      Therefore, pretending to be afraid of him, she retired a few steps to the\n      end of the grotto, and sitting down on the edge of the bed, artfully\n      pulled her tunic across her breast; then, motionless and mute and her eyes\n      cast down, she waited. Her long eyelashes made a soft shadow on her\n      cheeks. Her entire attitude expressed modesty; her naked feet swung\n      gently, and she looked like a child sitting thinking on the bank of a\n      brook. But Paphnutius looked at her, and did not move. His trembling knees\n      hardly supported him, his tongue dried in his mouth, a terrible buzzing\n      rang in his ears. But all at once his sight failed, and he could see\n      nothing before him but a thick cloud. He thought that the hand of Jesus\n      had been laid on his eyes, to hide this woman from them. Reassured by such\n      succour, strengthened and fortified, he said with a gravity worthy of an\n      old hermit of the desert --",

A good deal too much\n      is said on His behalf, and He is often credited with ideas He never had.\n      You yourself, stranger, do you know His true character?

It was the peculiar\n      gift of this woman; on her everything lived, and was soul and harmony. Her\n      robe, which was of mauve spangled with silver, trailed in long folds with\n      a grace that was almost melancholy and was not relieved by either\n      bracelets or necklaces. The chief charm of her appearance was her\n      beautiful bare arms. The two friends were obliged to admire, in spite of\n      themselves the robe and head-dress of Thais, though they said nothing to\n      her on the subject.",
                "\"How beautiful you are!\" said Philina. \"You could not have been more so\n      when you came to Alexandria. Yet my mother, who remembers seeing you then,\n      says there were few women who were worthy to be compared with you.\"",
                "\"Who is the new lover you have brought?\" asked Drosea. \"He has a strange,\n      wild appearance. If there are shepherds of elephants, assuredly he must\n      resemble one.

                "At that moment, a grave-looking old man, negligently dressed, walking\n      slowly, with his head high, entered the room, and gazed at the guests\n      quietly. Cotta made a sign to him to take a place by his side, on the same\n      couch.",
                "\"Eucrites,\" he said, \"you are welcome. Have you composed a new treatise on\n      philosophy this month? That would make, if I calculate correctly, the\n      ninety-second that has proceeded from the Nile reed you direct with an\n      Attic hand.\"",

                "EUCRITES. You deceive yourself, Dorion. The philosophy of virtue is not\n      dead. I have numerous disciples in Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople.\n      Many of the slaves, and some of the nephews of Caesar, now know how to\n      govern themselves, to live independently, and being unconcerned with all\n      affairs, they enjoy boundless happiness. Many of them have revived, in\n      their own person, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. But if it were true that\n      virtue were for ever extinguished upon the earth, in what way would the\n      loss of it affect my happiness, since it did not depend on me whether it\n      existed or perished? Only fools, Dorion, place their happiness out of\n      their own power. I desire nothing that the gods do not wish, and I desire\n      all that they do wish. By that means I render myself like unto them, and\n      share their infallible content. If virtue perishes, I consent that it\n      should perish, and that consent fills me with joy, as the supreme effort\n      of my reason or my courage. In all things my wisdom will copy the divine\n      wisdom, and the copy will be more valuable than the model; it will have\n      cost greater care and more work.",
                "NICIAS. I understand. You put yourself on the same level as divine\n      providence. But if virtue consists only in effort, Eucrites, and in that\n      intense application by which the disciples of Zeno pretend to render\n      themselves equal to the gods, the frog, which swelled itself out to try\n      and become as big as the ox, accomplished a masterpiece of stoicism.",
                "EUCRITES. You jest, Nicias, and, as usual, you excel in ridicule. But if\n      the ox of which you speak is really a god, like Apis, or like that\n      subterranean ox whose high priest I see here, and if the frog, being\n      wisely inspired, succeed in equalling it, would it not be, in fact, more\n      virtuous than the ox, and could you refrain from admiring such a\n      courageous little animal!",
                "Four servants placed on the table a wild pig, still covered with its\n      bristles. Little pigs, made of pastry, surrounded the animal, as though\n      they would suckle, to show that it was a sow.",
                "Zenothemis, turning towards the monk, said --",
                "\"Friends, a guest has come hither to join us. The illustrious Paphnutius,\n      who leads such an extraordinary life of solitude, is our unexpected\n      guest.\"",
                "COTTA. You may even add, Zenothemis, that the place of honour is due to\n      him, because he came without being invited.",
                "ZENOTHEMIS. Therefore, we ought, my dear Lucius, to make him the more\n      welcome, and strive to do that which would be most agreeable to him. Now\n      it is certain that such a man cares less for the perfumes of meat than for\n      the perfumes of fine thoughts. We shall, doubtless, please him by\n      discussing the doctrine he professes, which is that of Jesus crucified.\n      For my own part, I shall the more willingly discuss this doctrine, because\n      it keenly interests me, on account of the number and the diversity of the\n      allegories it contains. If one may guess at the spirit by the letter, it\n      is filled with truths, and I consider that the Christian books abound in\n      divine revelations. But I should not, Paphnutius, grant equal merit to the\n      Jewish books. They were inspired not, as it was said, by the Spirit of\n      God, but by an evil genius. Iaveh, who dictated them, was one of those\n      spirits who people the lower air, and cause the greater part of the evils,\n      from which we suffer; but he surpassed all the others in ignorance and\n      ferocity. On the contrary, the serpent with golden wings, which twined its\n      azure coils round the tree of knowledge, was made up of light and love. A\n      combat between these two powers -- the one of light and the other of\n      darkness -- was, therefore, inevitable. It occurred soon after the\n      creation of the world. God had hardly begun to rest after His labors; Adam\n      and Eve, the first man and the first woman, lived happy and naked in the\n      Garden of Eden, when Iaveh conceived -- to their misfortune -- the\n      design of governing them and all the generations which Eve already bore in\n      her splendid loins. As he possessed neither the compass nor the lyre, and\n      was equally ignorant of the science which commands and the art which\n      persuades, he frightened these two poor children by hideous apparitions,\n      capricious threats, and thunder-bolts. Adam and Eve, feeling his shadow\n      upon them, pressed closer to one another, and their love waxed stronger in\n      fear. The serpent took pity on them, and determined to instruct them, in\n      order that, possessing knowledge, they might no longer be misled by lies.\n      Such an undertaking required extreme prudence, and the frailty of the\n      first human couple rendered it almost hopeless. The well-intentioned demon\n      essayed it, however. Without the knowledge of Iaveh -- who pretended to\n      see everything, but, in reality, was not very sharp-sighted -- he\n      approached these two beings, and charmed their eyes by the splendour of\n      his coat and the brilliancy of his wings. Then he interested their minds\n      by forming before them, with his body, definite figures, such as the\n      circle, the ellipse, and the spiral, the wonderful properties of which\n      have since been recognised by the Greeks. Adam meditated on these figures\n      more than Eve did. But when the serpent began to speak, and taught the\n      most sublime truths -- those which cannot be demonstrated -- he\n      found that Adam being made of red earth, was of too dull a nature to\n      understand these subtle distinctions, but that Eve, on the contrary, being\n      more tender and more sensitive, was easily impressed. Therefore he\n      conversed with her alone, in the absence of her husband, in order to\n      initiate her first --",
                "DORION. Permit me, Zenothemis, to interrupt you. I speedily recognised in\n      the myth you have explained to us an episode in the war of Pallas Athene\n      against the giants. Iaveh much resembles Typhoon, and Pallas is\n      represented by the Athenians with a serpent at her side. But what you have\n      said causes me considerable doubt as to the intelligence or good faith of\n      the serpent of whom you have spoken. If he had really possessed knowledge,\n      would he have entrusted it to a woman's little head, which was incapable\n      of containing it? I should rather consider that he was like Iaveh,\n      ignorant and a liar, and that he chose Eve because she was easily seduced,\n      and he imagined that Adam would have more intelligence and perception.",
                "ZENOTHEMIS. Learn, Dorion, that it is not by perception and intelligence,\n      but by sensibility, that the highest and purest truths are reached. That\n      is why women, who, generally, are less reflective but more sensitive than\n      men, rise more easily to the knowledge of things divine. In them is the\n      gift of prophecy, and it is not without reason that Apollo Citharedes, and\n      Jesus of Nazareth, are sometimes represented clad, like women, in flowing\n      robes. The initiator was therefore wise -- whatever you may say to the\n      contrary, Dorion -- in bestowing light, not on the duller Adam, but on\n      Eve, who was whiter than milk or the stars. She freely listened to him,\n      and allowed herself to be led to the tree of knowledge, the branches of\n      which rose to heaven, and which was bathed with the divine spirit as with\n      a dew. This tree was covered with leaves which spoke all the languages of\n      future races of men, and their united voices formed a perfect harmony. Its\n      abundant fruit gave to the initiated who tasted it the knowledge of\n      metals, stones, and plants, and also of physical and moral laws; but this\n      fruit was like fire, and those who feared suffering and death did not dare\n      to put it to their lips. Now, as she had listened attentively to the\n      lessons of the serpent, Eve despised these empty terrors, and wished to\n      taste the fruit which gave the knowledge of God. But, as she loved Adam,\n      and did not wish him to be inferior to her, she took him by the hand and\n      led him to the wonderful tree. Then she picked one of the burning apples,\n      bit it, and proffered it to her companion. Unfortunately, Iaveh, who was\n      by chance walking in the garden, surprised them, and seeing that they had\n      become wise, he fell into a most ungovernable rage. It is in his jealous\n      fits that he is most to be feared. Assembling all his forces, he created\n      such a turmoil in the lower air that these two weak beings were terrified.\n      The fruit fell from the man's hand, and the woman, clinging to the neck of\n      her luckless husband, said, \"I too will be ignorant and suffer with him.\"\n       The triumphant Iaveh kept Adam and Eve and all their seed in a condition\n      of hebetude and terror. His art, which consisted only in being able to\n      make huge meteors, triumphed over the science of the serpent, who was a\n      musician and geometrician. He made men unjust, ignorant, and cruel, and\n      caused evil to reign in the earth. He persecuted Cain and his sons because\n      they were skilful workmen; he exterminated the Philistines because they\n      composed Orphic poems, and fables like those of AEsop. He was the\n      implacable enemy of science and beauty, and for long ages the human race\n      expiated, in blood and tears, the defeat of the winged serpent.\n      Fortunately, there arose among the Greeks learned men, such as Pythagoras,\n      and Plato, who recovered by the force of genius, the figures and the ideas\n      which the enemy of Iaveh had vainly tried to teach the first woman. The\n      soul of the serpent was in them; and that is why the serpent, as Dorion\n      has said, is honoured by the Athenians. Finally, in these latter days,\n      there appeared, under human form, three celestial spirits -- Jesus of\n      Galilee, Basilides, and Valentinus -- to whom it was given to pluck the\n      finest fruits of that tree of knowledge, whose roots pass through all the\n      earth, and whose top reaches to the highest heaven. I have said all this\n      in vindication of the Christians, to whom the errors of the Jews are too\n      often imputed.",
                "DORION. If I understood you aright, Zenothemis, you said that three\n      wonderful men -- Jesus, Basilides, and Valentinus -- had discovered\n      secrets which had remained hidden from Pythagoras and Plato, and all the\n      philosophers of Greece, and even from the divine Epicurus, who, however,\n      has freed men from the dread of empty terrors. You would greatly oblige me\n      by telling me by what means these three mortals acquired knowledge which\n      had eluded the most contemplative sages.",
                "ZENOTHEMIS. Must I repeat to you, Dorion, that science and cogitation are\n      but the first steps to knowledge, and that ecstasy alone leads to eternal\n      truth?",
                "HERMODORUS. It is true, Zenothemis, that the soul is nourished on ecstasy,\n      as the cicada is nourished on dew. But we may even say more: the mind\n      alone is capable of perfect rapture. For man is of a threefold nature,\n      composed of material body, of a soul which is more subtle, but also\n      material, and of an incorruptible mind. When, emerging from the body as\n      from a palace suddenly given over to silence and solitude and flying\n      through the gardens of the soul, the mind diffuses itself in God, it\n      tastes the delights of an anticipated death, or rather of a future life,\n      for to die is to live; and in that condition, partaking of divine purity,\n      it possesses both infinite joy and complete knowledge. It enters into the\n      unity which is All. It is perfected.",
                "NICIAS. That is very fine; but, to say the truth, Hermodorus, I do not see\n      much difference between All and Nothing. Words even seem to fail to make\n      the distinction. Infinity is terribly like nothingness -- they are both\n      inconceivable to the mind. In my opinion perfection costs too dear; we pay\n      for it with all our being, and to possess it must cease to exist. That is\n      a calamity from which God Himself is not free, for the philosophers are\n      doing their best to perfect Him. After all, if we do not know what it is\n      not to be, we are equally ignorant what it is to be. We know\n      nothing. It is said that it is impossible for men to agree on this\n      question. I believe -- in spite of our noisy disputes -- that it is,\n      on the contrary, impossible for men not to become some day all at unity\n      buried under the mass of contradictions, a Pelion on Ossa, which they\n      themselves have raised.",

I do not deny that liberty is the greatest boon a nation can\n      have. But the longer I live the more I am persuaded that only a strong\n      government can bestow it on the citizens. For forty years I have filled\n      high positions in the State, and my long experience has shown me that when\n      the ruling power is weak the people are oppressed. Those, therefore, who -- like\n      the great majority of rhetoricians -- try to weaken the government,\n      commit an abominable crime. An autocrat, who governs by his single will,\n      may sometimes cause most deplorable results; but if he governs by popular\n      consent there is no remedy possible.

He must\n      continue inactive if He would remain perfect, and must act if He would\n      prove to Himself His own existence. You assure me that He decided to act.\n      I am willing to believe you, although it was an unpardonable imprudence on\n      the part of a perfect God.

Cease jesting at the true God of the Christians, Nicias, and\n      learn that, like the lilies of the field, He toils not, neither does He\n      spin. It was not He who was the worker, it was His only Son, Jesus, who,\n      having created the world, came afterwards to repair His handiwork.

Doubtless ugliness is ugly, and\n      not beautiful; but if all were beautiful, the whole would not be\n      beautiful.

Evil contributes to the ultimate salvation of men, and, in\n      that respect issues from Good, and shares the merits belonging to Good.\n      This has been admirably expressed by the Christians, in the myth\n      concerning the man with red hair, who, in order to betray his master, gave\n      him the kiss of peace, and by such act assured the salvation of men.\n      Therefore, nothing is, in my opinion, more unjust and absurd than the hate\n      with which certain disciples of Paul, the tentmaker, pursue the most\n      unfortunate of the apostles of Jesus without realising that the kiss of\n      Iscariot -- prophesied by Jesus Himself -- was necessary, according\n      to their own doctrine, for the redemption of men, and that if Judas had\n      not received the thirty pieces, the divine wisdom would have been\n      impugned, Providence frustrated, its designs upset, and the world given\n      over to evil, ignorance, and death.",

I spoke just now, Marcus, as though I believed that the\n      redemption of men had been accomplished by Jesus crucified, because I know\n      that such is the belief of the Christians, and I borrowed their opinion\n      that I might the better show the mistake of those who believe in the\n      eternal damnation of Judas.

They placed the baskets\n      on the table, the flute ceased, and Zenothemis spoke as follows --",
                "\"When Eunoia, 'the thought of God,' had created the world, she confided\n      the government of the earth to the angels. But they did not preserve the\n      dispassion befitting masters. Seeing that the daughters of men were fair,\n      they surprised them in the evening by the wellside, and united themselves\n      to them. From these unions sprang a turbulent race, who covered the earth\n      with injustice and cruelty, and the dust of the roads drank up the blood\n      of the innocent. The sight of this caused Eunoia infinite grief.",

Their suffering is my\n      crime, and I will expiate it. God Himself, who only thinks through me,\n      would be powerless to restore them to their pristine purity. That which is\n      done is done, and the creation will remain for ever imperfect. But, at\n      least, I will not forsake my creatures. If I cannot make them happy, like\n      me, I can make myself unhappy, like them. Since I committed the mistake of\n      giving them bodies which dishonour them, I will myself assume a body like\n      unto theirs, and will go and live amongst them.'",
                "\"Having thus spoken, Eunoia descended to the earth, and was incarnate in\n      the breast of a woman of Argos. She was born small and feeble, and\n      received the name of Helen. She submitted to all the labours of this life,\n      but soon grew in grace and beauty, and became the most desired of women,\n      as she had determined, in order that her mortal body might be tried by the\n      most supreme defilements. An inert prey to lascivious and violent men, she\n      suffered rape and adultery, in expiation of all the adulteries, all the\n      violences, all the iniquities, and caused, by her beauty, the ruin of\n      nations, that God might pardon the sins of the universe. And never was the\n      celestial thought, never was Eunoia, so adorable as in those days when, as\n      a woman, she prostituted herself to heroes and shepherds. The poets\n      surmised her divinity when they painted her so peaceful, superb, and\n      fatal, and when they addressed that invocation to her, 'A soul as serene\n      as a calm upon the waters.'",

She died, and the\n      Argives still show her tomb -- for it was necessary that she should\n      know death after lust, and taste the bitter fruit she had sown. But,\n      emerging from the decomposed flesh of Helen, she became incarnate again as\n      a woman, and again suffered every form of insult and outrage. Thus,\n      passing from body to body, throughout all the evil ages, she takes upon\n      her the sins of the world. Her sacrifice will not be in vain. Joined to us\n      by the bonds of the flesh, loving us, and weeping with us, she will effect\n      her redemption and ours, and will carry us, clinging to her white breast,\n      into the peace of the regained paradise.\"",

Listen! there is, a dozen hours from\n      Alexandria, towards the west, not far from the sea, a nunnery, the rules\n      of which, a masterpiece of wisdom, deserve to be put in lyric verse and\n      sung to the sound of the theorbo and tambourines. It may truly be said\n      that the women who are there, submissive to these rules, have their feet\n      upon earth and their faces in heaven. They desire to be poor, that Jesus\n      may love them, modest, that He may gaze upon them; chaste that He may wed\n      them. He visits them every day in the guise of a gardener, His feet bare,\n      His beautiful hands open -- even as He showed Himself to Mary at the\n      entrance of the tomb. I will conduct thee this very day to this nunnery,\n      my Thais, and soon, commingling with these holy women, thou wilt share in\n      their heavenly conversation. They await thee as a sister. On the threshold\n      of the convent, their mother, the pious Albina, will give thee the kiss of\n      peace and will say, 'My daughter, thou art welcome!'\"",

I will seal the door, and there, a happy prisoner, thou wilt\n      wait in tears till Jesus Himself come, as a sign of pardon, to break the\n      seal that I have placed.

Dost thou wish that, animated by\n      the demons, and carried by the evil spirit that is in them, those accursed\n      belongings should pursue thee even to the desert? It is but too true that\n      there are tables which bring ruin, seats which serve as the instruments of\n      devils, which act, speak, strike the ground, and pass through the air. Let\n      all perish which has seen thy shame! Hasten, Thais, and, whilst the city\n      is yet asleep, order thy slaves to make, in the centre of this place, a\n      pile, upon which we will burn all the abominable riches thy dwelling\n      contains.\"",
                "Thais consented.",

At night some articles of furniture talk, either by\n      giving knocks at regular intervals or by emitting little flashes of light\n      as signals. And even more. Have you remarked, my father, at the entrance\n      to the Grotto of Nymphs, on the right, a statue of a naked woman about to\n      bathe? One day I saw, with my own eyes, that statue turn its head like a\n      living person, and then return to its ordinary attitude. I was terrified.\n      Nicias, to whom I related this prodigy, laughed at me; yet there must be\n      some magic in that statue, for it inspired with violent desires a certain\n      Dalmatian, who was insensible to my beauty. It is certain that I have\n      lived amongst enchanted things, and that I was exposed to the greatest\n      perils, for men have been strangled by the embraces of a bronze statue.\n      Yet it would be a pity to destroy valuable works made with rare skill, and\n      to burn my carpets and tapestry would be a great loss. The beautiful\n      colours of some of them are truly wonderful, and they cost much money to\n      those who gave them to me. I also possess cups, statues, and pictures of\n      great price. I do not think they ought to perish. But you know what is\n      necessary. Do as you will, my father.\"",
                "Thus saying, she followed the monk to the little door at which so many\n      garlands and wreaths had been hung, and, when it was opened, she told the\n      porter to call together all the slaves in the house. Four Indians, who\n      were employed in the kitchen, were the first to appear. They were all four\n      yellow men, and each had but one eye. It had cost Thais much trouble, and\n      given her amusement, to get together these four slaves of the same race,\n      and all afflicted with the same infirmity. When they attended at table\n      they excited the curiosity of the guests, and Thais made them relate the\n      story of their lives. These four waited in silence. Their assistants\n      followed them. Then came the stablemen, the huntsmen, the litter-bearers,\n      and the running footmen with muscles like iron, two gardeners hirsute as\n      Priapus, six ferocious looking negroes, three Greek slaves -- one a\n      grammarian, another a poet, and the third a singer. They all stood, ranged\n      in order, on the public square, and were presently joined by the negresses -- curious,\n      suspicious, rolling big round eyes, and each with a huge mouth slit to her\n      earrings. Lastly, adjusting their veils and languidly dragging their feet,\n      which were shackled with light gold chains, appeared six sulky-looking,\n      beautiful white slave-girls. When they were all assembled, Thais, pointing\n      to Paphnutius, said --",

                "They were astonished, and stood motionless, looking at their mistress. And\n      they still stood inactive and silent, and pressed against each other,\n      elbow to elbow, suspecting that the order was a joke.",
                "\"Obey!\" said the monk.",
                "Several of them were Christians. They understood the command, and went to\n      the house to fetch wood and torches. The others were not indisposed to\n      imitate them, for, being poor, they hated riches and had a natural\n      instinct for destruction. Whilst they were building the pile, Paphnutius\n      said to Thais --",
                "\"I thought at one time of fetching the treasurer of one of the churches of\n      Alexandria (if there still remain one worthy of the name of church, and\n      that is not defiled by the Arian beasts) and giving him thy goods, woman,\n      that he might distribute them to widows, and change the proceeds of crime\n      into the treasure of justice. But such a thought did not come from God,\n      and I cast it from me, for assuredly it would be a great offence to the\n      well-beloved of Jesus Christ to offer them the spoils of thy lust. Thais,\n      all that thou hast touched must be devoured by the fire, even to its very\n      soul. Thanks be to Heaven, these tunics and veils, which have seen kisses\n      more innumerable than the waves of the sea, will only feel now the lips\n      and tongues of the flames. Hasten, slaves! More wood! More links and\n      torches! And thou, woman, return to thy house, strip thyself of thy\n      shameful robes, and ask of the most humble of thy slaves, as an\n      undeserving favour, the tunic that she puts on when she scrubs the\n      floors.\"",
                "Thais obeyed. Whilst the Indians knelt down and blew the embers, the\n      negroes threw on the pile coffers of ivory, ebony, or cedar, which broke\n      open and let out wreaths, garlands, and necklaces. The smoke rose in a\n      dark column, as in the holocausts of the old religion. Then the fire,\n      which had been smouldering, burst out suddenly with a roar as of some\n      monstrous animal, and the almost invisible flames began to devour their\n      valuable prey. The slaves worked more eagerly; they joyfully dragged out\n      rich carpets, veils embroidered with silver, and flowered tapestry. They\n      staggered under the weight of tables, couches, thick cushions, and beds\n      with gold nails. Three strong Ethiopians came hugging the coloured statues\n      of the nymphs, one of which had been loved as though it were a mortal; and\n      they looked like huge apes carrying off women. And when the beautiful\n      naked forms fell from the arms of these monsters, and were broken on the\n      stones, a deep groan was heard.",
                "At that moment Thais appeared, her hair unloosed and streaming over her\n      shoulders, barefooted, and clad in a clumsy coarse garment which seemed\n      redolent with divine voluptuousness merely from having touched her body.\n      Behind her came a gardener, carrying, half hidden in his long beard, an\n      ivory Eros.",
                "She made a sign to the man to stop, and approaching Paphnutius, showed him\n      the little god.",
                "\"My father,\" she asked, \"should this also be thrown into the flames? It is\n      of marvellous antique work, and is worth a hundred times its weight in\n      gold. Its loss would be irreparable, for there is not a sculptor in the\n      world capable of making such a beautiful Eros. Remember also, my father,\n      that this child is Love, and he should not be harshly treated. Believe me,\n      Love is a virtue, and if I have sinned, it is not through him, my father,\n      but against him. Never shall I regret aught that he has caused me to do,\n      and I deplore only those things I have done contrary to his commands. He\n      does not allow women to give themselves to those who do not come in his\n      name. For that reason he ought to be honoured. Look, Paphnutius, how\n      pretty this little Eros is! With what grace he hides himself in the\n      gardener's beard! One day Nicias, who loved me then, brought it to me and\n      said, 'It will remind you of me.' But the roguish boy did not remind me of\n      Nicias, but of a young man I knew at Antioch. Enough riches have been\n      destroyed upon this pile, my father! Preserve this Eros, and place it in\n      some monastery. Those who see it will turn their hearts towards God, for\n      love leads naturally to heavenly thoughts.\"",
                "The gardener, already believing that the little Eros was saved, smiled on\n      it as though it had been a child, when Paphnutius, snatching the god from\n      the arms which held it, threw it into the flames, crying --",
                "\"It is enough that Nicias has touched it to make it replete with every\n      sort of poison!\"",

                "One by one, the neighbours, awakened by the noise, opened the windows, and\n      rubbing their eyes, looked out to see whence the smoke came. Then they\n      came down, half dressed, and drew near the fire.",

                "Amongst them were merchants from whom Thais had often bought perfumes and\n      stuffs, and they looked on anxiously with long, yellow faces, unable to\n      comprehend what was going on. Some young debauchees, who, returning from a\n      supper, passed by there, preceded by their slaves, stopped, their heads\n      crowned with flowers, their tunics floating, and uttered loud cries.\n      Attracted by curiosity, the crowd increased unceasingly, and soon it was\n      known that Thais had been persuaded by the Abbot of Antinoe to burn her\n      riches and retire to a nunnery.",
                "The shopkeepers thought to themselves --",
                "\"Thais is going to leave the city; we shall sell no more to her; it is\n      dreadful to think of. What will become of us without her? This monk has\n      driven her mad. He is ruining us. Why let him do it? What is the use of\n      the laws? Are there no magistrates in Alexandria? Thais does not think\n      about us and our wives and our poor children. It is a public scandal. She\n      ought to be compelled to stay in the city.\"",
                "The young men, on their part, also thought --",
                "\"If Thais is going to renounce acting and love, our chief amusements will\n      be taken from us. She was the glory, delight, and honour of the stage. She\n      was the joy even of those who had never possessed her. The women we loved,\n      we loved in her. There were no kisses given in which she was altogether\n      absent, for she was the joy of all voluptuaries, and the mere thought that\n      she breathed amongst us excited us to pleasure.\"",
                "Thus thought the young men, and one of them, named Cerons, who had held\n      her in his arms, cried out upon the abduction, and blasphemed against\n      Christ. In every group the conduct of Thais was severely criticised.",

                "\"How shall we live when Thais is no longer here to feed us? Every day the\n      fragments from her table fed two hundred poor wretches, and her lovers,\n      when they quitted her, threw us as they passed handfuls of silver pieces.\"",
                "Some thieves, too, also mingled with the crowd, and created a deafening\n      clamour, and pushed their neighbours, to increase disorder, and take\n      advantage of the tumult to filch some valuable object.",

                "And striking with his fist the men, upsetting the old women and treading\n      on the young children, he reached Thais, and taking her aside --",

                "And he put his hand on Thais. But, pushed away by the monk with unexpected\n      force, he staggered back four paces and fell at the foot of the pile\n      amongst the scattered ashes.",

He picked up stones and oyster\n      shells, which he hid in the skirt of his tunic, and not daring to throw\n      them himself slipped them into the hands of the beggars. Soon the stones\n      began to fly, and a well-directed shell cut Paphnutius' face. The blood,\n      which flowed down the dark face of the martyr, dropped in a new baptism on\n      the head of the penitent, and Thais, half stifled in the monk's embrace\n      and her delicate skin scratched by the coarse cassock, felt a thrill of\n      horror and fright.",

                "But, being only used to subtle disquisitions with philosophers, he did not\n      possess that imperious energy which commands vulgar minds. He was not\n      listened to. A shower of stones and shells fell on the monk, who,\n      protecting Thais with his body, praised the Lord whose goodness turned his\n      wounds into caresses. Despairing of making himself heard, and feeling but\n      too sure that he could not save his friend either by force or persuasion,\n      Nicias resigned himself to the will of the gods -- in whom he had\n      little confidence -- when the idea occurred to him to use a stratagem\n      which his contempt for men had suddenly suggested to him. He took from his\n      girdle his purse, which was full of gold and silver, for he was a\n      pleasure-loving and charitable man, and running up to the men who were\n      throwing the stones, he chinked the money in their ears. At first they\n      paid no attention to him, their fury being too great; but little by little\n      their looks turned towards the chinking gold, and soon their arms dropped\n      and no longer menaced their victim. Seeing that he had attracted their\n      eyes and minds, Nicias opened his purse and threw some pieces of gold and\n      silver amongst the crowd. The more greedy of them stooped to pick it up.\n      The philosopher, pleased at his first success, adroitly threw deniers and\n      drachmas here and there. At the sound of the pieces of money rattling on\n      the pavement, the persecutors of Paphnutius threw themselves on the\n      ground. Beggars, slaves, and tradespeople scrambled after the money,\n      whilst, grouped round Cerons, the patricians watched the struggle and\n      laughed heartily. Cerons himself quite forgot his wrath. His friends\n      encouraged the rivals, chose competitors, and made bets, and urged on the\n      miserable wretches as they would have done fighting dogs. A cripple\n      without legs having succeeded in seizing a drachma, the applause was\n      frenetic. The young men themselves began to throw money, and nothing was\n      to be seen in the square but a multitude of backs, rising and falling like\n      waves of the sea, under a shower of coins. Paphnutius was forgotten.",
                "Nicias ran up to him, covered him with his cloak, and dragged him and\n      Thais into by-streets where they were safe from pursuit. They ran for some\n      time in silence, and when they thought they were out of reach of their\n      enemies, they ceased running, and Nicias said, in a tone of raillery in\n      which a little sadness was mingled --",

                "\"It is true, Nicias,\" replied Thais, \"that I am tired of living with men\n      like you, smiling, perfumed, kindly egoists.

I\n      believe him, for he knows the truth.\"",
                "\"And I, sweetheart,\" replied Nicias, smiling, \"I know the truths. He knows\n      but one, I know them all. I am superior to him in that respect, but to\n      tell the truth, it doesn't make me any the prouder nor any the happier.\"",
                "Then, seeing that the monk was glaring fiercely at him --",
                "\"My dear Paphnutius, do not imagine that I think you extremely absurd, or\n      even altogether unreasonable. And if I were to compare your life with\n      mine, I could not say which is preferable in itself.

Well, my dear friend, in accomplishing these\n      acts, so different apparently, we are both obeying the same sentiment, the\n      only motive for all human actions; we are both seeking our own pleasure,\n      and striving to attain the same end -- happiness, the impossible\n      happiness. It would be folly on my part to say you were wrong, dear\n      friend, even though I think myself in the right.",
                "\"And you, my Thais, go and enjoy yourself, and be more happy still, if it\n      be possible, in abstinence and austerity than you have been in riches and\n      pleasure. On the whole, I should say you were to be envied. For if in our\n      whole lives, Paphnutius and I have pursued but one kind of pleasurable\n      satisfaction, you in your life, dear Thais, have tasted diverse joys such\n      as it is rarely given to the same person to know. I should really like to\n      be for one hour, a saint like our dear friend Paphnutius. But that is not\n      possible. Farewell, then, Thais! Go where the secret forces of nature and\n      your destiny conduct you! Go, and take with you, whithersoever you go, the\n      good wishes of Nicias! I know that is mere foolishness, but can I give you\n      anything more than barren regrets and vain wishes in payment for the\n      delicious illusions which once enveloped me when I was in your arms, and\n      of which only the shadow now remains to me? Farewell, my benefactress!\n      Farewell, goodness that is ignorant of its own existence, mysterious\n      virtue, joy of men! Farewell to the most adorable of the images that\n      nature has ever thrown -- for some unknown reasons -- on the face of\n      this deceptive world!\"",

Their shops were full of clay figures painted in\n      bright colours and representing gods and goddesses, mimes, women, winged\n      sprites, &c., such as were usually buried with the dead. He fancied\n      that perhaps some of the little images which he saw there might be the\n      companions of his eternal sleep; and it seemed to him that a little Eros,\n      with its tunic tucked up, laughed at him mockingly. He looked forward to\n      his death, and the idea was painful to him. To cure his sadness he tried\n      to philosophise, and reasoned thus --",

Does that mean that I shall live for ever? No, but I conclude\n      therefrom that my death is, always has been, as it always will be. I do\n      not feel it yet, but it is in me, and I ought not to fear it, for it would\n      be folly to dread the coming of that which has arrived.

But, far from\n      feeling any of the pity which softens the hearts of the profane,\n      Paphnutius rejoiced at these propitiatory sufferings of the flesh which\n      had so sinned. So infuriated was he with holy zeal that he would have\n      liked to cut with rods the body that had preserved its beauty as a shining\n      witness to its infamy. His meditations augmented his pious fury, and\n      remembering that Thais had received Nicias in her bed, that idea seemed so\n      horrible to him that his blood all flowed back to his heart, and his\n      breast felt ready to burst. His curses were stifled in his throat, and he\n      could only grind his teeth. He sprang forward and stood before her, pale,\n      terrible, and filled with the Spirit of God -- looked into her very\n      soul, and then spat in her face.",
                "She calmly wiped her face and continued to walk on. He followed, glaring\n      at her in pious anger, as if she had been hell itself. He was thinking how\n      he could avenge Christ in order that Christ should not avenge Himself,\n      when he saw a drop of blood that had dripped from the foot of Thais on the\n      sand. Then a hitherto unknown influence entered his opened heart, sobs\n      rose to his lips, he wept, he ran and knelt before her, called her his\n      sister, and kissed her bleeding feet.

They drank fresh water\n      in their hands, and talked of things eternal. She said --",

There were some who baked bread, or prepared vegetables; many\n      were spinning wool, and the light of heaven shone upon them like a smile\n      of God. Others meditated in the shade of the tamarisk trees; their white\n      hands hung by their sides, for, being filled with love, they had chosen\n      the part of Magdalen, and performed no work but prayer, contemplation, and\n      ecstasy.

For some time he was incapable of thought and\n      when he did recover himself, his meditations only increased his\n      perplexity.",
                "\"It is one of two things,\" he said to himself; \"either this vision, like\n      the preceding ones, came from God, and was a good vision, and it is my\n      natural perversity which has misrepresented it, as wine turns sour in a\n      dirty cup. I have, by my unworthiness, changed instruction into reproach,\n      of which this diabolical jackal immediately took advantage. Or else this\n      vision came, not from God, but, on the contrary, from the devil, and was\n      evil. In that case I should doubt whether the former ones had, as I\n      thought, a celestial origin. I am therefore incapable of that discernment\n      which is necessary for the ascetic. In either case it is plain that God is\n      no longer with me, -- of which I feel the effects, though I cannot\n      explain the cause.\"",
                "He reasoned in this way, and anxiously asked --",
                "\"Just God, what trials dost Thou appoint for Thy servants if the\n      apparitions of Thy saints are a danger for them? Give me to discern, by an\n      intelligible sign, that which comes from Thee, and that which comes from\n      the other.\"",
                "And as God, whose designs are inscrutable, did not see fit to enlighten\n      his servant, Paphnutius, lost in doubt, resolved not to think of Thais any\n      more. But his resolutions were vain. Though absent, she was ever with him.\n      She gazed at him whilst he read, or meditated, or prayed, or met his eyes\n      wherever he looked. Her imaginary approach was heralded by a slight sound,\n      such as is made by a woman's dress when she walks, and the visions had\n      more verisimilitude than reality itself, which moves and is confused,\n      whereas the phantoms which are caused by solitude are fixed and\n      unchangeable. She came under various appearances -- sometimes pensive,\n      her head crowned with her last perishable wreath, clad as at the banquet\n      at Alexandria, in a mauve robe spangled with silver flowers; sometimes\n      voluptuously in a cloud of light veils, and bathed in the warm shadows of\n      the Grotto of Nymphs; sometimes in a serge cassock, pious and radiant with\n      celestial joy; sometimes tragic, her eyes swimming in the terrors of\n      death, and showing her bare breast bedewed with the blood from her pierced\n      heart. What disturbed him the most in these visions was that the wreaths,\n      tunics, and veils, that he had burned with his own hands, should thus\n      return; it became evident to him that these things had an imperishable\n      soul, and he cried --",
                "\"Lo, all the countless souls of the sins of Thais come upon me!\"",
                "When he turned away his head, he felt that Thais was behind him, and that\n      made him feel still more uneasy. His torture was cruel. But as his soul\n      and body remained pure in the midst of all his temptations, he trusted in\n      God, and gently complained to Him.",
                "\"My God, if I went so far to seek her amongst the Gentiles, it was for Thy\n      sake, and not for mine. It would not be just that I should suffer for what\n      I have done in Thy behalf. Protect me, sweet Jesus! My Saviour, save me!\n      Suffer not the phantom to accomplish that which the body could not. As I\n      have triumphed over the flesh, suffer not the shadow to overthrow me. I\n      know that I am now exposed to greater dangers than I ever ran. I feel and\n      know that the dream has more power than the reality. And how could it be\n      otherwise, since it is itself but a higher reality? It is the soul of\n      things. Plato, though he was but an idolater, has testified to the real\n      existence of ideas. At that banquet of demons to which Thou accompaniedst\n      me, Lord, I heard men -- sullied with crimes truly, but certainly not\n      devoid of intelligence -- agree to acknowledge that we see real objects\n      in solitude, meditation, and ecstasy; and Thy Scriptures, my God, many\n      times affirm the virtue of dreams, and the power of visions formed either\n      by Thee, great God, or by Thy adversary.\"",
                "There was a new man in him and now he reasoned with God, but God did not\n      choose to enlighten him. His nights were one long dream, and his days did\n      not differ from his nights. One morning he awoke uttering sighs, such as\n      issue, by moonlight, from the tombs of the victims of crimes. Thais had\n      come, showing her bleeding feet, and whilst he wept, she had slipped into\n      his couch. There was no longer any doubt; the image of Thais was an impure\n      image.",
                "His heart filled with disgust, he leaped out of his profaned couch, and\n      hid his face in his hands that he might not see the daylight. The hours\n      passed, but they did not remove his shame. All was quiet in the cell. For\n      the first time for many long days, Paphnutius was alone. The phantom had\n      at last left him, and even its absence seemed dreadful. Nothing, nothing\n      to distract his mind from the recollection of the dream. Full of horror,\n      he thought --",
                "\"Why did I not drive her away? Why did I not tear myself from her cold\n      arms and burning knees?\"",
                "He no longer dared to pronounce the name of God near that horrible couch,\n      and he feared that his cell being profaned, the demons might freely enter\n      at any hour. His fears did not deceive him. The seven little jackals,\n      which had never crossed the threshold, entered in a file, and went and hid\n      under the bed. At the vesper hour, there came an eighth, the stench of\n      which was horrible. The next day, a ninth joined the others, and soon\n      there were thirty, then sixty, then eighty. They became smaller as they\n      multiplied, and being no bigger than rats, they covered the floor, the\n      couch, and the stool. One of them jumped on the little table by the side\n      of the bed, and standing with its four feet together on the death's head,\n      looked at the monk with burning eyes. And every day fresh jackals came.",
                "To expiate the abominable sin of his dream, and flee from impure thoughts,\n      Paphnutius determined to leave his cell, which had now become polluted, go\n      far into the desert, and practise unheard-of austerities, strange labours,\n      and fresh works of grace. But before putting his design into action, he\n      went to see old Palemon and ask his advice.",
                "He found him in his garden watering his lettuces. It was the evening. The\n      blue Nile flowed at the foot of violet hills. The good old man was walking\n      slowly, in order not to frighten a pigeon that had perched on his\n      shoulder.",
                "\"The Lord be with thee, brother Paphnutius,\" he said. \"Admire his\n      goodness; He sends me the animals that He has created that I may converse\n      with them of His works, and praise Him in the birds of the air. Look at\n      this pigeon; note the changing hues of its neck, and say, is it not a\n      beautiful work of God? But have you not come to talk with me, brother, on\n      some pious subject? If so, I will put down my watering-pot, and listen to\n      you.\"",
                "Paphnutius told the old man about his journey, his return, the visions of\n      his days and the dreams of his nights, -- without omitting the sinful\n      one -- and the pack of jackals.",
                "\"Do you not think, father,\" he added, \"that I ought to bury myself in the\n      desert, and perform some extraordinary austerities that would even\n      astonish the devil?\"",
                "\"I am but a poor sinner,\" replied Palemon, \"and I know little about men,\n      having passed all my life in this garden, with gazelles, little hares and\n      pigeons. But it seems to me, brother, that your distemper comes from your\n      having passed too suddenly from the noisy world to the calm of solitude.\n      Such sudden transitions can but do harm to the health of the soul. You\n      are, brother, like a man who exposes himself, almost at the same time, to\n      great heat and great cold. A cough shakes him, and fever torments him. In\n      your place, brother Paphnutius, instead of retiring at once into some\n      awful desert, I should take such amusements as are fitting to a monk and a\n      holy abbot. I should visit the monasteries in the neighbourhood. Some of\n      them are wonderful, it is said. That of Abbot Serapion contains, I have\n      been told, a thousand four hundred and thirty-two cells, and the monks are\n      divided into as many legions as there are letters in the Greek alphabet. I\n      am even informed that a certain analogy is observed between the character\n      of the monks and the shape of the letter by which they are designated, and\n      that, for example, those who are placed under Z have a tortuous character,\n      whilst those under I have an upright mind. If I were you, brother, I\n      should go and assure myself of this with my own eyes, and I should know no\n      rest until I had seen such a wonderful thing. I should not fail to study\n      the regulations of the various communities which are scattered along the\n      banks of the Nile, so as to be able to compare one with another. Such\n      study is befitting a religious man like yourself. You have heard say, no\n      doubt, that Abbot Ephrem has drawn up for his monastery pious regulations\n      of great beauty. With his permission, you might make a copy of them, as\n      you are a skilful penman. I could not do so, for my hands, accustomed to\n      wield the spade, are too awkward to direct the thin reed of the scribe\n      over the papyrus. But you have the knowledge of letters, brother, and\n      should thank God for it, for beautiful writing cannot be too much admired.\n      The work of the copyist and the reader is a great safeguard against evil\n      thoughts. Brother Paphnutius, why do you not write out the teachings of\n      our fathers, Paul and Anthony? Little by little you would recover, in\n      these pious works, peace of soul and mind; solitude would again become\n      pleasant to your heart, and soon you would be in a condition to recommence\n      those ascetic works which your journey has interrupted. But you must not\n      expect much benefit from excessive penitence. When he was amongst us, our\n      Father Anthony used to say, 'Excessive fasting produces weakness, and\n      weakness begets idleness. There are some monks who ruin their body by\n      fasts improperly prolonged. Of them it may be said that they plunge a\n      dagger into their own breast, and deliver themselves up unresistingly into\n      the power of the devil.' So said the holy man, Anthony. I am but a foolish\n      old man, but, by the grace of God, I have remembered what our father told\n      us.\"",
                "Paphnutius thanked Palemon and promised to think over his advice. When he\n      had passed the fence of reeds which enclosed the little garden, he turned\n      round and saw the good old gardener engaged in watering his salads, whilst\n      the pigeon walked about on his bent back, and at that sight Paphnutius\n      felt ready to weep.",
                "On returning to his cell, he found there a strange turmoil, as though it\n      were filled with grains of sand blown about by a strong wind, and on\n      looking closer, he saw these moving bodies were myriads of little jackals.\n      That night he saw in a dream, a high stone column surmounted by a human\n      face, and he heard a voice which said --",
                "\"Ascend this pillar!\"",
                "On awaking, he felt confident that this dream had been sent from heaven.\n      He called his disciples, and addressed them in these words --",
                "\"My beloved sons, I must leave you, and go where God sends me. During my\n      absence obey Flavian as you would me, and take care of our brother Paul.\n      Bless you. Farewell.\"",
                "As he strode away, they remained prostrate on the ground, and when they\n      raised their heads, they saw his tall dark figure on the sandy horizon.",
                "He walked day and night until he reached the ruins of the temple, formerly\n      built by the idolaters, in which he had slept amongst the scorpions and\n      sirens on his former strange journey. The walls, covered with magic signs,\n      were still standing. Thirty immense columns, which terminated in human\n      heads or lotus flowers, still supported a heavy stone entablature. But, at\n      one end of the temple, a pillar had shaken off its old burden, and stood\n      isolated. It had for its capital the head of a woman which smiled, with\n      long eyes and rounded cheeks, and on her forehead cow's horns.",
                "Paphnutius, on seeing it, recognised the column which had been shown him\n      in his dream, and he calculated that it was thirty-two cubits high. He\n      went to the neighbouring village, and ordered a ladder of that height to\n      be made; and when the ladder was placed against the pillar, he ascended,\n      knelt down on the top, and said to the Lord --",
                "\"Here, then, O God, is the abode Thou hast chosen for me. May I remain\n      here, in Thy Grace, until the hour of my death.\"",
                "He had brought no provisions with him, trusting in divine providence, and\n      expecting that charitable peasants would give him all that he needed. And,\n      in fact, the next day, about the ninth hour, women came with their\n      children, bringing bread, dates, and fresh water, which the boys carried\n      to the top of the column.",
                "The top of the pillar was not large enough to allow the monk to lie at\n      full length, so that he slept with his legs crossed and his head on his\n      breast, and sleep was a more cruel torture to him than his wakeful hours.\n      At dawn the ospreys brushed him with their wings, and he awoke filled with\n      pain and terror.",
                "It happened that the carpenter who had made the ladder feared God.\n      Disturbed at the thought that the saint was exposed to the sun and rain,\n      and fearing that he might fall in his sleep, this pious man constructed a\n      roof and a railing on the top of the column.",
                "Soon the report of this extraordinary existence spread from village to\n      village, and the labourers of the valley came on Sundays, with their wives\n      and children, to look at the stylite. The disciples of Paphnutius, having\n      learned with surprise the place of this wonderful retreat, came to him,\n      and obtained from him permission to build their huts at the foot of the\n      column. Every morning they came and stood in a circle round the master,\n      and received from him the words of instruction.",
                "\"My sons,\" he said to them, \"continue like those little children whom\n      Jesus loved. That is the way of salvation. The sin of the flesh is the\n      source and origin of all sins; they spring from it as from a parent.\n      Pride, avarice, idleness, anger, and envy are its dearly beloved progeny.\n      I have seen this in Alexandria; I have seen rich men carried away by the\n      vice of lust, which, like a river with a turbid flood, swept them into the\n      gulf of bitterness.\"",
                "The abbots Ephrem and Serapion, being informed of his strange proceeding,\n      wished to behold him with their own eyes. Seeing from afar, on the river,\n      the triangular sail which was bringing them to him, Paphnutius could not\n      prevent himself from thinking that God had made him an example to all\n      solitary monks. The two abbots, when they saw him, did not conceal their\n      surprise; and, having consulted together, they agreed in condemning such\n      an extraordinary penance, and exhorted Paphnutius to come down.",
                "\"Such a mode of life is contrary to all usage,\" they said; \"it is\n      peculiar, and against all rules.\"",
                "But Paphnutius replied --",
                "\"What is the monastic life if not peculiar? And ought not the deeds of a\n      monk to be as eccentric as he is himself? It was a sign from God that\n      caused me to ascend here; it is a sign from God that will make me\n      descend.\"",
                "Every day religious men came to join the disciples of Paphnutius, and they\n      built for themselves shelters round the aerial hermitage. Several of them,\n      to imitate the saint, mounted the ruins of the temple; but, being reproved\n      by their brethren, and conquered by fatigue, they soon gave up these\n      attempts.",
                "Pilgrims flocked from all parts. There were some who had come long\n      distances, and were hungry and thirsty. The idea occurred to a poor widow\n      of selling fresh water and melons. Against the foot of the column, behind\n      her bottles of red clay, her cups and her fruit under an awning of\n      blue-and-white striped canvas, she cried, \"Who wants to drink?\" Following\n      the example of this widow, a baker brought some bricks and made an oven\n      close by, in the hope of selling loaves and cakes to visitors. As the\n      crowd of visitors increased unceasingly, and the inhabitants of the large\n      cities of Egypt began to come, some man, greedy of gain, built a\n      caravanserai to lodge the guests and their servants, camels, and mules.\n      Soon there was, in front of the column, a market to which the fishermen of\n      the Nile brought their fish, and the gardeners their vegetables. A barber,\n      who shaved people in the open air, amused the crowd with his jokes. The\n      old temple, so long given over to silence and solitude was filled with\n      countless sights and sounds of life. The innkeepers turned the\n      subterranean vaults into cellars and nailed on the old pillars signs\n      surmounted by the figure of the holy Paphnutius, and bearing this\n      inscription in Greek and Egyptian -- \"Pomegranate wine, fig wine,\n      and genuine Cilician beer sold here.\" On the walls, sculptured with\n      pure and graceful carvings, the shop-keepers hung ropes of onions, and\n      smoked fish, dead hares, and the carcases of sheep. In the evening, the\n      old occupants of the ruins, the rats, scuttled in a long row to the river,\n      whilst the ibises, suspiciously craning their necks, perched on the high\n      cornices, to which rose the smoke of the kitchens, the shouts of the\n      drinkers, and the cries of the tapsters. All around, builders laid out\n      streets, and masons constructed convents, chapels, and churches. By the\n      end of six months a city was established with a guardhouse, a tribunal, a\n      prison, and a school, kept by an old blind scribe.",
                "The pilgrims were innumerable. Bishops and other Church dignitaries, came,\n      full of admiration. The Patriarch of Antioch, who chanced to be in Egypt\n      at that time, came with all his clergy. He highly approved of the\n      extraordinary conduct of the stylite, and the heads of the Libyan Church\n      followed, in the absence of Athanasius, the opinion of the Patriarch.\n      Having learned which, Abbots Ephrem and Serapion came to the feet of\n      Paphnutius to apologise for their former mistrust. Paphnutius replied --",
                "\"Know, my brothers, that the penance I endure is barely equal to the\n      temptations which are sent me, the number and force of which astound me. A\n      man, viewed externally, is but small, and, from the height of the pillar\n      to which God has called me, I see human beings moving about like ants.\n      But, considered internally, man is immense; he is as large as the world,\n      for he contains it. All that is spread before me -- these monasteries,\n      these inns, the boats on the river, the villages, and what I see in the\n      distance of fields, canals, sand, and mountains -- is nothing in\n      respect to what is in me. I carry in my heart countless cities and\n      illimitable deserts. And evil -- evil and death -- spread over this\n      immensity, cover them all, as night covers the earth. I am, in myself\n      alone, a universe of evil thoughts.\"",
                "He spoke thus because the desire for woman was in him.",
                "The seventh month, there came from Alexandria, Bubastis and Sais, women\n      who had long been barren, hoping to obtain children by the intercession of\n      the holy man and the virtues of his pillar. They rubbed their sterile\n      bodies against the stone. There followed a procession, as far as the eye\n      could reach, of chariots, palanquins, and litters, which stopped and\n      pushed and jostled below the man of God. From them came sick people\n      terrible to see. Mothers brought to Paphnutius young boys whose limbs were\n      twisted, their eyes starting, their mouth foaming, their voices hoarse. He\n      laid his hands upon them. Blind men approached, groping with their hands,\n      and raising towards him a face pierced with two bleeding holes. Paralytics\n      displayed before him the heavy immobility, the deadly emaciation, and the\n      hideous contractions of their limbs; lame men showed him their club feet;\n      women with cancer, holding their bosoms with both hands, uncovered before\n      him their breasts devoured by the invisible vulture. Dropsical women,\n      swollen like wine skins were placed on the ground before him. He blessed\n      them. Nubians, afflicted with elephantiasis, advanced with heavy steps and\n      looked at him with streaming eyes and expressionless countenances. He made\n      the sign of the cross over them. A young girl of Aphroditopolis was\n      brought to him on a litter; after having vomited blood, she had slept for\n      three days. She looked like a waxen image, and her parents, who thought\n      she was dead, had placed a palm leaf on her breast. Paphnutius having\n      prayed to God, the young girl raised her head and opened her eyes.",
                "As the people reported everywhere the miracles which the saint had\n      performed, unfortunate persons afflicted with that disease which the\n      Greeks call \"the divine malady,\" came from all parts of Egypt in\n      incalculable legions. As soon as they saw the pillar, they were seized\n      with convulsions, rolled on the ground, writhed, and twisted themselves\n      into a ball. And -- though it is hardly to be believed -- the\n      persons present were in their turn seized with a violent delirium, and\n      imitated the contortions of the epileptics. Monks and pilgrims, men and\n      women, wallowed and struggled pell-mell, their limbs twisted, foaming at\n      the mouth, eating handfuls of earth and prophesying. And Paphnutius at the\n      top of his pillar felt a thrill of horror pass through him, and cried to\n      God --",
                "\"I am the scapegoat, and I take upon me all the impurities of these\n      people, and that is why, Lord, my body is filled with evil spirits.\"",
                "Every time that a sick person went away healed, the people applauded,\n      carried him in triumph, and ceased not to repeat --",
                "\"We behold another well of Siloam!\"",
                "Hundreds of crutches already hung round the wonderful column; grateful\n      women suspended wreaths and votive images there. Some of the Greeks\n      inscribed distiches, and as every pilgrim carved his name, the stone was\n      soon covered as high as a man could reach with an infinity of Latin,\n      Greek, Coptic, Punic, Hebrew, Syrian, and magic characters.",
                "When the feast of Easter came there was such an affluence of people to\n      this city of miracles that old men thought that the days of the ancient\n      mysteries had returned. All sorts of people, in all sorts of costumes,\n      were to be seen there; the striped robes of the Egyptians, the burnoose of\n      the Arabs, the white drawers of the Nubians, the short cloak of the\n      Greeks, the long toga of the Romans, the scarlet breeches of the\n      barbarians, the gold-spangled robes of the courtesans. A veiled woman\n      would pass on an ass, preceded by black eunuchs, who cleared a passage for\n      her by the free use of their sticks. Acrobats, having spread a carpet on\n      the ground, juggled and performed skilful tricks before a circle of silent\n      spectators. Snake-charmers unrolled their living girdles. A glittering,\n      dusty, noisy, chattering crowd! The curses of the camel-drivers beating\n      the animals; the cries of the hawkers who sold amulets against leprosy and\n      the evil eye; the psalmody of the monks reciting verses of the Bible; the\n      shrieking of the women who were prophesying; the shouting of the beggars\n      singing old songs of the harem; the bleating of sheep; the braying of\n      asses; the sailors calling tardy passengers; all these confused noises\n      caused a deafening uproar, over which dominated the strident voices of the\n      little naked negro boys, running about everywhere selling fresh dates.",
                "And all these human beings stifled under the white sky, in a heavy\n      atmosphere laden with the perfumes of women, the odour of negroes, the\n      fumes of cooking and the smoke of gums, which the devotees bought of the\n      shepherds to burn before the saint.",
                "When night came, fires, torches, and lanterns were lighted everywhere, and\n      nothing was to be seen but red shadows and black shapes. Standing amidst a\n      circle of squatting listeners, an old man, his face lighted by a smoky\n      lamp, related how, formerly, Bitiou had enchanted his heart, torn it from\n      his breast, placed it in an acacia, and then transformed himself into a\n      tree. He made gestures, which his shadow repeated with absurd\n      exaggerations, and the audience uttered cries of admiration. In the\n      taverns, the drinkers, lying on couches, called for beer and wine. Dancing\n      girls, with painted eyes and bare stomachs, performed before them\n      religious or lascivious scenes. In retired corners, young men played dice\n      or other games, and old men followed prostitutes. Above all these rose the\n      solitary, unchanging column; the head with the cow's horns gazed into the\n      shadow, and above it Paphnutius watched between heaven and earth. All at\n      once the moon rose over the Nile, like the bare shoulder of a goddess. The\n      hills gleamed with blue light, and Paphnutius thought he saw the body of\n      Thais shinning in the glimmer of the waters amidst the sapphire night.",
                "The days passed, and the saint still lived on his pillar. When the rainy\n      season came, the waters of heaven, filtering through the cracks in the\n      roof, wetted his body; his stiff limbs were incapable of movement.\n      Scorched by the sun, and reddened by the dew, his skin broke; large ulcers\n      devoured his arms and legs. But the desire of Thais still consumed him\n      inwardly, and he cried --",
                "\"It is not enough, great God! More temptations! More unclean thoughts!\n      More horrible desires! Lord, lay upon me all the lusts of men, that I may\n      expiate them all! Though it is false that the Greek bitch took upon\n      herself all the sins of the world, as I heard an impostor once declare,\n      yet there is a hidden meaning in the fable, the truth of which I now\n      recognise. For it is true that the sins of the people enter the soul of\n      the saints, and are lost there as in a well. Thus it is that the souls of\n      the just are polluted with more filth than is ever found in the soul of\n      the sinner. And, for that reason, I praise Thee, O my God, for having made\n      me the cesspool of the world.\"",
                "One day, a rumour ran through the holy city, and even reached the ears of\n      the hermit: a very great personage, a man occupying a high position, the\n      Prefect of the Alexandrian fleet, Lucius Aurelius Cotta, was about to\n      visit the city -- was, indeed, now on his way.",
                "The news was true. Old Cotta, who was inspecting the canals and the\n      navigation of the Nile, had many times expressed a desire to see the\n      stylite and the new city, to which the name of Stylopolis had been given.\n      The Stylopolitans saw the river covered with sails one morning. Cotta\n      appeared on board a golden galley hung with purple, and followed by all\n      his fleet. He landed, and advanced, accompanied by a secretary carrying\n      his tablets, and Aristaeus, his physician, with whom he liked to converse.",
                "A numerous suite walked behind him, and the shore was covered with laticlaves(*)\n      and military uniforms. He stopped, some paces from the column, and began\n      to examine the stylite, wiping his face meanwhile with the skirt of his\n      toga. Being of a naturally curious disposition, he had observed many\n      things in the course of his long voyages. He liked to remember them, and\n      intended to write, after he had finished his Punic history, a book on the\n      remarkable things he had witnessed. He seemed much interested by the\n      spectacle before him.",
                "(*) The laticlave was a toga, with a broad purple band,\n     worn by Roman senators as the distinguishing mark of their\n     high office.",
                "\"This is very curious!\" he said, puffing and blowing. \"And -- which is\n      a circumstance worthy of being recorded -- this man was my guest. Yes,\n      this monk supped with me last year, after which he carried off an\n      actress.\"",
                "Turning to his secretary --",
                "\"Note that, my son, on my tablets; also the dimensions of the column, not\n      omitting the shape of the top of it.\"",
                "Then, wiping his face again --",
                "\"Persons deserving of belief have assured me that this monk has not left\n      his column for a single moment since he mounted it a year ago. Is that\n      possible, Aristaeus?\"",
                "\"That which is possible to a lunatic or a sick man,\" replied Aristaeus,\n      \"would be impossible to a man sound in body and mind. Do you know, Lucius,\n      that sometimes diseases of the mind or body give to those afflicted by\n      them a strength which healthy men do not possess? For, as a matter of\n      fact, there is no such thing as good health or bad health. There are only\n      different conditions of the organs. Having studied what are called\n      maladies, I have come to consider them as necessary forms of life. I take\n      pleasure in studying them in order to be able to conquer them. Some of\n      them are worthy of admiration, and conceal, under apparent disorder,\n      profound harmonies; for instance, a quartan fever is certainly a very\n      pretty thing! Sometimes certain affections of the body cause a rapid\n      augmentation of the faculties of the mind. You know Creon? When he was a\n      child, he stuttered and was stupid. But, having cracked his skull by\n      tumbling off a ladder, he became an able lawyer, as you are aware. This\n      monk must be affected in some hidden organ. Moreover, this kind of\n      existence is not so extraordinary as it appears to you, Lucius. I may\n      remind you that the gymnosophists of India can remain motionless, not\n      merely for a year, but during twenty, thirty, or forty years.\"",
                "\"By Jupiter!\" cried Cotta, \"that is a strange madness. For man was born to\n      move and act, and idleness is an unpardonable crime, because it is an\n      injury to the State. I do not know of any religion in which such an\n      objectionable practice is permitted, though it possibly may be in some of\n      the Asiatic creeds. When I was Governor of Syria, I found phalli\n      erected in the porches at the city of Hera. A man ascended, twice a year,\n      and remained there for a week. The people believed that this man talked\n      with the gods, and interceded with them for the prosperity of Syria. The\n      custom appeared senseless to me; nevertheless I did nothing to put it\n      down. For I consider that a functionary ought not to interfere with the\n      manners and customs of the people, but on the contrary, to see that they\n      are preserved. It is not the business of the government to force a\n      religion on a people, but to maintain that which exists, which, whether\n      good or bad, has been regulated by the spirit of the time, the place, and\n      the race. If it endeavours to put down a religion, it proclaims itself\n      revolutionary in its spirit, and tyrannical in its acts, and is justly\n      detested. Besides, how are you to raise yourself above the superstitions\n      of the vulgar, except by understanding them and tolerating them?\n      Aristaeus, I am of opinion that I should leave this nephelo-coccygian(*)\n      in the air, exposed only to the indignities the birds shower on him. I\n      should not gain anything by having him pulled down, but I should by taking\n      note of his thoughts and beliefs.\"",

                "He puffed, coughed, and placed his hand on the secretary's shoulder.",
                "\"My child, note down that, amongst certain sects of Christians, it is\n      considered praiseworthy to carry off courtesans and live upon columns. You\n      may add that these customs are evidence of the worship of genetic\n      divinities. But on this point we ought to question him himself.\"",
                "Then, raising his head, and shading his eyes with his hand, to keep off\n      the sun, he shouted --",
                "\"Hallo, Paphnutius! If you remember that you were once my guest, answer\n      me. What are you doing up there? Why did you go up, and why do you stay\n      there? Has this column any phallic signification in your mind?\"",
                "Paphnutius, considering Cotta as nothing but an idolater, did not deign to\n      reply. But his disciple, Flavian, approached, and said --",
                "\"Illustrious Sir, this holy man takes the sins of the world upon him, and\n      cures diseases.\"",
                "\"By Jupiter! Do you hear, Aristaeus?\" cried Cotta. \"This nephelo-coccygian\n      practises medicine, like you. What do you think of so high a rival?\"",
                "Aristaeus shook his head.",
                "\"It is very possible that he may cure certain diseases better than I can;\n      such, for instance, as epilepsy, vulgarly called the divine malady,\n      although all maladies are equally divine, for they all come from the gods.\n      But the cause of this disease lies, partly, in the imagination, and you\n      must confess, Lucius, that this monk, perched up on the head of a goddess,\n      strikes the minds of the sick people more forcibly than I, bending over my\n      mortars and phials in my laboratory, could ever do. There are forces,\n      Lucius, infinitely more powerful than reason and science.\"",
                "\"What are they?\" asked Cotta.",
                "\"Ignorance and folly,\" replied Aristaeus.",
                "\"I have rarely seen a more curious sight,\" continued Cotta, \"and I hope\n      that some day an able writer will relate the foundation of Stylopolis. But\n      even the most extraordinary spectacles should not keep, longer than is\n      befitting, a serious and busy man from his work. Let us go and inspect the\n      canals. Farewell, good Paphnutius! or rather, till our next meeting! If\n      ever you should come down to earth again, and revisit Alexandria, do not\n      fail to come and sup with me.\"",
                "These words, heard by all present, passed from mouth to mouth, and being\n      repeated by the believers, added greatly to the reputation of Paphnutius.\n      Pious minds amplified and transformed them, and it was stated that\n      Paphnutius, from the top of his pillar, had converted the Prefect of the\n      Fleet to the faith of the apostles and the Nicaean fathers. The believers\n      found a figurative meaning in the last words uttered by Aurelius Cotta; to\n      them, the supper to which this important personage had invited the\n      ascetic, was a holy communion, a spiritual repast, a celestial banquet.\n      The story of this meeting was embroidered with wonderful details, which\n      those who invented were the first to believe. It was said that when Cotta,\n      after a long argument, had embraced the truth, an angel had come from\n      heaven to wipe the sweat from his brow. The physician and secretary of the\n      Prefect of the Fleet had also, it was asserted, been converted at the same\n      time. And, the miracle being public and notorious, the deacons of the\n      principal churches of Libya recorded it amongst the authentic facts. After\n      that, it could be said, without any exaggeration, that the whole world was\n      seized with a desire to see Paphnutius, and that, in the West as well as\n      the East, all Christians turned their astonished eyes towards him. The\n      most celebrated cities of Italy sent deputations to him, and the Roman\n      Caesar, the divine Constantine who favoured the Christian religion, wrote\n      him a letter which the legates brought to him with great ceremony. But one\n      night, whilst the budding city at his feet slept in the dew, he heard a\n      voice, which said --",
                "\"Paphnutius, thou art become celebrated by thy works and powerful by thy\n      word. God has raised thee up for His glory. He has chosen thee to work\n      miracles, heal the sick, convert the Pagans, enlighten sinners, confound\n      the Arians, and establish peace in the Church.\"",
                "Paphnutius replied --",
                "\"God's will be done!\"",
                "The voice continued --",
                "\"Arise, Paphnutius, and go seek in his palace the impious Constans, who,\n      far from imitating the wisdom of his brother, Constantine, inclines to the\n      errors of Arius and Marcus. Go! The bronze gates shall fly open before\n      thee, and thy sandals shall resound on the golden floor of the basilica\n      before the throne of the Caesars, and thy awe-inspiring voice shall change\n      the heart of the son of Constantinus. Thou shalt reign over a peaceful and\n      powerful Church. And, even as the soul directs the body, so shall the\n      Church govern the empire. Thou shalt be placed above senators, comites,\n      and patricians. Thou shalt repress the greed of the people, and check the\n      boldness of the barbarians. Old Cotta, knowing that thou art the head of\n      the government, will seek the honour of washing thy feet. At thy death thy\n      cilicium shall be taken to the patriarch of Alexandria, and the\n      great Athanasius, white with glory, shall kiss it as the relic of a saint.\n      Go!\"",
                "Paphnutius replied --",
                "\"Let the will of God be accomplished!\"",
                "And making an effort to stand up, he prepared to descend. But the voice,\n      divining his intention, said --",
                "\"Above all, descend not by the ladder. That would be to act like an\n      ordinary man, and to be unconscious of the gifts that are in thee. A great\n      saint, like thee, ought to fly through the air. Leap! the angels are there\n      to support thee. Leap, then!\"",
                "Paphnutius replied --",
                "\"The will of God be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\"",
                "Extending his long arms like the ragged wings of a huge sick bird, he was\n      about to throw himself down, when, suddenly, a hideous mocking laugh rang\n      in his ears. Terrified, he asked --",
                "\"Who laughs thus?\"",
                "\"Ah? ah!\" screamed the voice, \"we are yet but at the beginning of our\n      friendship; thou wilt some day be better acquainted with me. My friend, it\n      was I who caused thee to ascend here, and I ought to be satisfied at the\n      docility with which thou hast accomplished my wishes. Paphnutius, I am\n      pleased with thee.\"",
                "Paphnutius murmured, in a voice stifled by fear --",
                "\"Avaunt, avaunt! I know thee now; thou art he who carried Jesus to a\n      pinnacle of the temple, and showed him all the kingdoms of this world.\"",
                "He fell, affrighted, on the stone.",
                "\"Why did I not know this sooner?\" he thought. \"More wretched than the\n      blind, deaf, and paralysed who trust in me, I have lost all knowledge of\n      things supernatural, and am more depraved than the maniacs who eat earth\n      and approach dead bodies. I can no longer distinguish between the clamours\n      of hell and the voices of heaven. I have lost even the intuition of the\n      new-born child, who cries when its nurse's breast is taken from it, of the\n      dog that scents out its master's footsteps, of the plant that turns\n      towards the sun. I am the laughing-stock of the devils. So, then, it is\n      Satan who led me here. When he elevated me on this pedestal, lust and\n      pride mounted with me. It is not the magnitude of my temptations which\n      terrifies me. Anthony, on his mountain, suffers the same. I wish that all\n      their swords may pierce my flesh, before the eyes of the angels. I have\n      even learned to like my sufferings. But God does not speak to me, and His\n      silence astonishes me. He has left me -- and I had but Him to look to.\n      He leaves me alone in the horror of His absence. He flies from me. I will\n      follow after Him. This stone burns my feet. Let me leave quickly, and come\n      up with God.\"",
                "With that he seized the ladder which stood against the column, put his\n      feet on it, and having descended a rung, found himself face to face with\n      the monster's head; she smiled strangely. He was certain then that what he\n      had taken for the site of his rest and glory, was but the diabolical\n      instrument of his trouble and damnation. He hastily descended and touched\n      the soil. His feet had forgotten their use, and he reeled. But, feeling on\n      him the shadow of the cursed column, he forced himself to run. All slept.\n      He traversed, without being seen, the great square surrounded by\n      wine-shops, inns, and caravanserias, and threw himself into a by-street\n      which led towards the Libyan Hills. A dog pursued him, barking, and\n      stopped only at the edge of the desert. Paphnutius went through a country\n      where there was no road but the trail of wild beasts. Leaving behind him\n      the huts abandoned by the coiners, he continued all night and all day his\n      solitary flight.",
                "At last, almost ready to expire with hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and not\n      knowing if God was still far from him, he came to a silent city which\n      extended from right to left, and stretched away till it was lost in the\n      blue horizon. The buildings, which were widely separated and like each\n      other, resembled pyramids cut off at half their height. They were tombs.\n      The doors were broken, and in the shadow of the chambers could be seen the\n      gleaming eyes of hyaenas and wolves who brought forth their young there,\n      whilst the dead bodies lay on the threshold, despoiled by robbers, and\n      gnawed by the wild beasts. Having passed through this funeral city,\n      Paphnutius fell exhausted before a tomb which stood near a spring\n      surrounded by palm trees. This tomb was much ornamented, and, as there was\n      no door to it, he saw inside it a painted chamber, in which serpents bred.",
                "\"Here,\" he sighed, \"is the abode I have chosen; the tabernacle of my\n      repentance and penitence.\"",
                "He dragged himself to it, drove out the reptiles with his feet, and\n      remained prostrate on the stone floor for eighteen hours, at the end of\n      which time he went to the spring, and drank out of his hand. Then he\n      plucked some dates and some stalks of lotus, the seeds of which he ate.\n      Thinking this kind of life was good, he made it the rule of his existence.\n      From morning to night he never lifted his forehead from the stone.",
                "One day, whilst he was thus prostrated, he heard a voice which said --",
                "\"Look at these images, that thou mayest learn.\"",
                "Then, raising his head, he saw, on the walls of the chamber, paintings\n      which represented lively and domestic scenes. They were of very old work,\n      and marvellously lifelike. There were cooks who blew the fire, with their\n      cheeks all puffed out; others plucked geese, or cooked quarters of sheep\n      in stew-pans. A little farther, a hunter carried on his shoulders a\n      gazelle pierced with arrows. In one place, peasants were sowing, reaping,\n      or gathering. In another, women danced to the sounds of viols, flutes, and\n      harp. A young girl played the theorbo. The lotus flower shone in her hair,\n      which was neatly braided. Her transparent dress let the pure forms of her\n      body be seen. Her bosom and mouth were perfect. The face was turned in\n      profile, and the beautiful eye looked straight before her. The whole\n      figure was exquisite. Paphnutius having examined it, lowered his eyes, and\n      replied to the voice --",
                "\"Why dost thou command me to look at these images? No doubt they represent\n      the terrestrial life of the idolater whose body rests here, under my feet,\n      at the bottom of a well, in a coffin of black basalt. They recall the life\n      of a dead man, and are, despite their bright colours, the shadows of a\n      shadow. The life of a dead man! O vanity!\"",
                "\"He is dead, but he lived,\" replied the voice; \"and thou wilt die, and\n      wilt not have lived.\"",
                "From that day, Paphnutius had not a moment's rest. The voice spoke to him\n      incessantly. The girl with the theorbo looked fixedly at him from\n      underneath the long lashes of her eye. At last she also spoke --",
                "\"Look. I am mysterious and beautiful. Love me. Exhaust in my arms the love\n      which torments you. What use is it to fear me? You cannot escape me; I am\n      the beauty of woman. Whither do you think to fly from me, senseless fool?\n      You will find my likeness in the radiancy of flowers, and in the grace of\n      the palm trees, in the flight of pigeons, in the bounds of the gazelle, in\n      the rippling of brooks, in the soft light of the moon, and if you close\n      your eyes, you will find me within yourself. It is a thousand years since\n      the man who sleeps here, swathed in linen, in a bed of black stone,\n      pressed me to his heart. It is a thousand years since he received the last\n      kiss from my mouth, and his sleep is yet redolent with it. You know me\n      well, Paphnutius. How is it you have not recognised me? I am one of the\n      innumerable incarnations of Thais. You are a learned monk, and well\n      skilled in the knowledge of things. You have travelled, and it is by\n      travel a man learns the most. Often a day passed abroad will show more\n      novelties than ten years passed at home. You have heard that Thais lived\n      formerly in Argos, under the name of Helen. She had another existence in\n      Thebes Hecatompyle. And I was Thais of Thebes. How is it you have not\n      guessed it? I took, when I was alive, a large share in the sins of this\n      world, and now reduced here to the condition of a shadow, I am still quite\n      capable of taking your sins upon me, beloved monk. Whence comes your\n      surprise? It was certain that, wherever you went, you would find Thais\n      again.\"",
                "He struck his forehead against the pavement, and uttered a cry of terror.\n      And every night the player of the theorbo left the wall, approached him,\n      and spoke in a clear voice mingled with soft breathing. And as the holy\n      man resisted the temptations she gave him, she said to him --",
                "\"Love me; yield, friend. As long as you resist me I shall torment you. You\n      do not know what the patience of a dead woman is. I shall wait, if\n      necessary, till you are dead. Being a sorceress, I shall put into your\n      lifeless body a spirit who will reanimate it, and who will not refuse me\n      what I have asked in vain of you. And think, Paphnutius, what a strange\n      situation when your blessed soul sees, from the height of heaven, its own\n      body given up to sin. God, who has promised to return you this body after\n      the day of judgment and the end of time, will Himself be much puzzled. How\n      can He place in celestial glory a human form inhabited by a devil, and\n      guarded by a sorceress? You have not thought of that difficulty. Nor God\n      either, perhaps. Between ourselves, He is not very knowing. Any ordinary\n      magician can easily deceive Him, and if He had not His thunder, and the\n      cataracts of heaven, the village urchins would pull His beard. He has\n      certainly not as much sense as the old serpent, His adversary. He, indeed,\n      is a wonderful artist. If I am so beautiful, it is because he adorned me\n      with all my attractions. It was he who taught me how to braid my hair, and\n      to make for myself rosy fingers with agate nails. You have misunderstood\n      him. When you came to live in this tomb, you drove out with your feet the\n      serpents which were here, without troubling yourself to know whether they\n      were of his family, and you crushed their eggs. I am afraid, my poor\n      friend, you will have a troublesome business on your hands. You were\n      warned, however, that he was a musician and a lover. What have you done?\n      You have quarrelled with science and beauty. You are altogether miserable,\n      and Iaveh does not come to your help. It is not probable that he will\n      come. Being as great as all things, he cannot move for want of space, and\n      if, by an impossibility, he made the least movement, all creation would be\n      pushed out of place. My handsome hermit, give me a kiss.\"",
                "Paphnutius was aware that great prodigies are performed by magic arts. He\n      thought -- not without much uneasiness --",
                "\"Perhaps the dead man buried at my feet knows the words written in that\n      mysterious book which exists hidden, not far from here, at the bottom of a\n      royal tomb. By virtue of these words, the dead, taking the form which they\n      had upon earth, see the light of the sun and the smiles of women.\"",
                "His chief fear was that the girl with the theorbo and the dead man might\n      come together, as they did in their lifetime, and that he should see them\n      unite. Sometimes he thought he heard the sound of kissing.",
                "He was troubled in his mind, and now, in the absence of God he feared to\n      think as much as to feel. One evening, when he was kneeling prostrate\n      according to his custom, an unknown voice said to him --",
                "\"Paphnutius, there are on earth more people than you imagine, and if I\n      were to show you what I have seen, you would die of astonishment. There\n      are men with a single eye in the middle of their forehead. There are men\n      who have but one leg, and advance by jumps. There are men who change their\n      sex, and the females become males. There are men-trees, who shoot out\n      roots in the ground. And there are men with no head, with two eyes, a\n      nose, and a mouth in their breast. Can you honestly believe that Jesus\n      Christ died for the salvation of these men?\"",
                "Another time he had a vision. He saw, in a strong light, a broad road,\n      rivulets, and gardens. On the road, Aristobulus and Chereas passed at a\n      gallop on their Syrian horses, and the joyous ardour of the race reddened\n      the cheeks of the two young men. Beneath a portico, Callicrates recited\n      his verses; satisfied pride trembled in his voice and shone in his eyes.\n      In the garden, Zenothemis picked apples of gold, and caressed a serpent\n      with azure wings. Clad in white, and wearing a shining mitre, Hermodorus\n      meditated beneath a sacred persea, which bore, instead of flowers, small\n      heads of pure profile, wearing, like the Egyptian goddesses, vultures,\n      hawks, or the shining disk of the moon; whilst in the background, by the\n      side of a fountain, Nicias studied, on an armillary sphere, the harmonious\n      movements of the stars.",
                "Then a veiled woman approached the monk, holding in her hand a branch of\n      myrtle. She said to him --",

But by that alone they submit\n      to fair Nature, and they are happy and beautiful in the joy of living\n      only, and give glory to the supreme artist of all things; for man is a\n      noble hymn to God. All think that happiness is innocent, and that pleasure\n      is permitted to man. Paphnutius, if they are right, what a dupe you have\n      been!\"",
                "And the vision vanished.",
                "Thus was Paphnutius tempted unceasingly in body and mind. Satan never gave\n      him a minute's repose. The solitude of the tomb was more peopled than the\n      streets of a great city. The devils shouted with laughter, and millions of\n      imps, evil genii, and phantoms imitated all the ordinary transactions of\n      life. In the evening, when he went to the spring, satyrs and nymphs\n      capered round him, and tried to drag him into their lascivious dances. The\n      demons no longer feared him. They loaded him with insults, obscene jests,\n      and blows. One day a devil, no longer than his arm, stole the cord he wore\n      round his waist.",
                "He said to himself --",
                "\"Thought, whither hast thou led me?\"",
                "And he resolved to work with his hands, in order to give his mind that\n      rest of which it had need. Near the spring, some banana trees, with large\n      leaves, grew under the shade of the palms. He cut the stalks, and carried\n      them to the tomb. He crushed them with a stone, and reduced them to\n      fibres, as he had seen ropemakers do. For he intended to make a cord, to\n      replace that which the devil had stolen. The demons were somewhat\n      displeased at this; they ceased their clamour, and the girl with the\n      theorbo no longer continued her magic arts, but remained quietly on the\n      wall. The courage and faith of Paphnutius increased whilst he pounded the\n      banana stems.",
                "\"With Heaven's help,\" he said to himself, \"I shall subdue the flesh. As to\n      my soul, its confidence is still unshaken. In vain do the devils, and that\n      accursed woman, try to instil into my mind doubts as to the nature of God.\n      I will reply to them, by the mouth of the Apostle John, 'In the beginning\n      was the Word, and the Word was God.' That I firmly believe, and that which\n      I believe is absurd, I believe still more firmly. In fact it should be\n      absurd. If it were not so, I should not believe; I should know. And it is\n      not that which we know which gives eternal life; it is faith only that\n      saves.\"",
                "He exposed the separated fibres to the sun and the dew, and every morning\n      he took care to turn them, to prevent them rotting; and he rejoiced to\n      find that he had become as simple as a child. When he had twisted his\n      cord, he cut reeds to make mats and baskets. The sepulchral chamber\n      resembled a basket-maker's workshop, and Paphnutius could pass without\n      difficulty from work to prayer. Yet still God was not merciful to him, for\n      one night he was awakened by a voice which froze him with horror, for he\n      guessed that it was the voice of the dead man.",
                "The voice called quickly, in a light whisper --",

                "Paphnutius suddenly perceived that his cheek rested on a woman's breast.\n      He recognised the player of the theorbo, who, partly relieved of his\n      weight, raised her breast. He clung tightly to the sweet, warm, perfumed\n      body, and consumed with the desire of damnation, he cried --",
                "\"Stay, stay, my heavenly one!\"",
                "But she was already standing on the threshold. She laughed, and her smile\n      gleamed in the silver rays of the moon.",
                "\"Why should I stay?\" she said. \"The shadow of a shadow is enough for a\n      lover endowed with such a lively imagination. Besides, you have sinned.\n      What more was needed?\"",
                "Paphnutius wept in the night, and when the dawn came, he murmured a prayer\n      that was a meek complaint --",
                "\"Jesus, my Jesus, why hast Thou forsaken me! Thou seest the danger in\n      which I am. Come, and help me, sweet Saviour. Since Thy Father no longer\n      loves me, and does not hear me, remember that I have but Thee. From Him\n      nothing is to be hoped; I cannot comprehend Him, and He cannot pity me.\n      But Thou was born of a woman, and that is why I trust in Thee. Remember\n      that Thou wast a man. I pray to Thee, not because Thou art God of God,\n      Light of light, very God of very God, but because Thou hast lived poor and\n      humble on this earth where now I suffer, because Satan has tempted Thy\n      flesh, because the sweat of agony has bedewed Thy face. It is to Thy\n      humanity that I pray, Jesus, my brother Jesus!\"",
                "When he had thus prayed, wringing his hands, a terrible peal of laughter\n      shook the walls of the tomb, and the voice which rang in his ears on the\n      top of the column, said jeeringly --",

                "When he reopened his eyes, he saw around him monks wearing black hoods,\n      who poured water on his temples, and recited exorcisms. Many others were\n      standing outside, carrying palm leaves.",

                "Paphnutius, raising his head, asked in a feeble voice --",

We are going with palm leaves to greet our holy father. But how\n      is it, brother, that you are ignorant of such a great event? Can it be\n      possible that no angel came to this tomb to inform you?\"",
                "\"Alas!\" replied Paphnutius, \"I am not worthy of such a favour, and the\n      only denizens of this abode are demons and vampires. Pray for me. I am\n      Paphnutius, Abbot of Antinoe, the most wretched of the servants of God.\"",
                "At the name of Paphnutius, all waved their palm leaves and murmured his\n      praises. The monk who had previously spoken, cried in surprise --",
                "\"Can it be that thou art that holy Paphnutius, celebrated for so many\n      works that it was supposed he would some day equal the great Anthony\n      himself? Most venerable, it was thou who convertedst to God the courtesan,\n      Thais, and who, raised upon a high column, was carried away by the\n      seraphs. Those who watched by night, at the foot of the pillar, saw thy\n      blessed assumption. The wings of the angels encircled thee in a white\n      cloud, and with thy right hand extended thou didst bless the dwellings of\n      man. The next day, when the people saw thou wert no longer there, a long\n      groan rose to the summit of the discrowned pillar. But Flavian, thy\n      disciple, reported the miracle, and took thy place as the head. But a\n      foolish man, of the name of Paul, tried to contradict the general opinion.\n      He asserted that he had seen thee, in a dream, carried away by the devils;\n      the people wanted to stone him, and it was a miracle that he escaped\n      death. I am Zozimus, abbot of these solitary monks whom thou seest\n      prostrate at thy feet. Like them, I kneel before thee, that thou mayest\n      bless the father with the children. Then thou shalt relate to us the\n      marvels which God has deigned to accomplish by thy means.\"",
                "\"Far from having favoured me as thou believest,\" replied Paphnutius, \"the\n      Lord has tried me with terrible temptations. I was not carried away by\n      angels. But a shadowy wall is raised in front of my eyes, and moves before\n      me. I have lived in a dream. Without God all is a dream. When I made my\n      journey to Alexandria, I heard, in a short space of time, many discourses,\n      and I learned that the army of errors was innumerable. It pursues me, and\n      I am compassed about with swords.\"",
                "Zozimus replied --",
                "\"Venerable father, we must remember that the saints, and especially the\n      solitary saints, undergo terrible trials. If thou wast not carried to\n      heaven by the seraphs, it is certain that the Lord granted that favour to\n      thy image, for Flavian, the monks, and the people were witnesses of thy\n      assumption.\"",
                "Paphnutius resolved to go and receive the blessing of Anthony.",
                "\"Brother Zozimus,\" he said, \"give me one of these palm leaves, and let us\n      go and meet our father.\"",
                "\"Let us go,\" replied Zozimus; \"military order is most befitting for monks,\n      who are God's soldiers. Thou and I, being abbots, will march in front, and\n      the others shall follow us, singing psalms.\"",
                "They set out on their march, and Paphnutius said --",
                "\"God is unity, for He is the truth, which is one. The world is many,\n      because it is error. We should turn away from all the sights of nature,\n      even those which appear the most innocent. Their diversity renders them\n      pleasant, which is a sign that they are evil. For that reason, I cannot\n      see a tuft of papyrus by the side of still waters without my soul being\n      imbued with melancholy. All things that the senses perceive are\n      detestable. The least grain of sand brings danger. Everything tempts us.\n      Woman is but a combination of all the temptations scattered in the thin\n      air, on the flowering earth, in the clear waters. Happy is he whose soul\n      is a sealed vase! Happy is he who knows how to be deaf, dumb, and blind,\n      and who knows nothing of the world, in order that he may know God!\"",
                "Zozimus, having meditated upon these words, replied as follows --",
                "\"Venerable father, it is fitting that I should avow my sins to thee, since\n      thou hast shown me thy soul. Thus we shall confess to each other,\n      according to the apostolic custom. Before I was a monk, I led an\n      abominable life. At Madaura, a city celebrated for its courtesans, I\n      sought out all kinds of worldly love. Every night I supped in company with\n      young debauchees and female flute players, and I took home with me the one\n      who pleased me the best. A saint like thee could never imagine to what a\n      pitch the fury of my desires carried me. Suffice it to say that it spared\n      neither matrons nor nuns, and spread adultery and sacrilege everywhere. I\n      excited my senses with wine, and was justly known as the heaviest drinker\n      in Madaura. Yet I was a Christian, and, in all my follies, kept my faith\n      in Jesus crucified. Having devoured my substance in riotous living, I was\n      beginning to feel the first attacks of poverty, when I saw one of my\n      companions in pleasure suddenly struck with a terrible disease. His knees\n      could not sustain him; his twitching hands refused to obey him; his glazed\n      eyes closed. Only horrible groans came from his breast. His mind, heavier\n      than his body, slumbered. To punish him for having lived like a beast, God\n      had changed him into a beast. The loss of my property had already inspired\n      me with salutary reflections, but the example of my friend was of yet\n      greater efficacy; it made such an impression on my heart that I quitted\n      the world and retired into the desert. There I have enjoyed for twenty\n      years a peace that nothing has troubled. I work with my monks as weaver,\n      architect, carpenter, and even as scribe, though, to say the truth, I have\n      little taste for writing, having always preferred action to thought. My\n      days are full of joy, and my nights without dreams, and I believe that the\n      grace of the Lord is in me, because, even in the midst of the most\n      frightful sins, I have never lost hope.\"",
                "On hearing these words, Paphnutius lifted his eyes to heaven and murmured --",
                "\"Lord, Thou lookest with kindness upon this man polluted by adultery,\n      sacrilege, and so many crimes, and Thou turnest away from me, who have\n      always kept Thy commandments! How inscrutable is Thy justice, O my God!\n      and how impenetrable are Thy ways!\"",
                "Zozimus extended his arms.",
                "\"Look, venerable father! On both sides of the horizon are long, black\n      files that look like emigrant ants. They are our brothers, who, like us,\n      are going to meet Anthony.\"",
                "When they came to the place of meeting, they saw a magnificent spectacle.\n      The army of monks extended, in three ranks, in an immense semicircle. In\n      the first rank stood the old hermits of the desert, cross in hand, and\n      with long beards that almost touched the ground. The monks, governed by\n      the abbots Ephrem and Serapion, and also all the cenobites of the Nile,\n      formed the second line. Behind them appeared the ascetics, who had come\n      from their distant rocks. Some wore, on their blackened and dried-up\n      bodies, shapeless rags; others had for their only clothes, bundles of\n      reeds held together by withies. Many of them were naked, but God had\n      covered them with a fell of hair as thick as a sheep's fleece. All held\n      branches of palm; they looked like an emerald rainbow, or they might have\n      been also compared to the host of the elect -- the living walls of the\n      city of God.",
                "Such perfect order reigned in the assembly, that Paphnutius found, without\n      difficulty, the monks he governed. He placed himself near them, after\n      having taken care to hide his face under his hood, that he might remain\n      unknown, and not disturb them in their pious expectation. Suddenly, an\n      immense shout arose --",
                "\"The saint!\" they all cried. \"The saint! Behold the great saint, against\n      whom hell has not prevailed, the well-beloved of God! Our father,\n      Anthony!\"",
                "Then a great silence followed, and every forehead was lowered to the sand.",
                "From the summit of a dune, in the vast void space, Anthony advanced,\n      supported by his beloved disciples, Macarius and Amathas. He walked\n      slowly, but his figure was still upright, and showed the remains of a\n      superhuman strength. His white beard spread over his broad chest, his\n      polished skull reflected the rays of sunlight like the forehead of Moses.\n      The keen gaze of the eagle was in his eyes; the smile of a child shone on\n      his round cheek. To bless his people, he raised his arms, tired by a\n      century of marvellous works, and his voice burst forth for the last time,\n      with the words of love.",
                "\"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!\"",
                "Immediately, from one end to the other of the living wall, like a peal of\n      harmonious thunder, the psalm, \"Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord,\"\n       broke forth.",
                "Accompanied by Macarius and Amathas, Anthony passed along the ranks of the\n      old hermits, anchorites, and cenobites. This seer, who had beheld heaven\n      and hell; this hermit, who from a cave in the rock, governed the Christian\n      Church; this saint, who had sustained the faith of the martyrs; this\n      scholar, whose eloquence had paralysed the heretics, spoke tenderly to\n      each of his sons, and bade them a kindly farewell, on the eve of the\n      blessed death, which God, who loved him, had at last promised him.",
                "He said to the abbots Ephrem and Serapion --",
                "\"You command large armies, and you are both great generals. Therefore, you\n      shall put on in heaven an armour of gold, and the Archangel Michael shall\n      give you the title of kiliarchs of his hosts.\"",
                "Perceiving the old man Philemon, he embraced him, and said --",

                "To all he spoke words of unerring wisdom.",

                "\"The apostle saw, round the throne of God, eighty old men seated, clad in\n      white robes, and wearing crowns on their heads.\"",
                "To the young men --",
                "\"Be joyful; leave sadness to the happy ones of this world.\"",
                "Thus he passed along the front of his filial army, exhorting and\n      comforting. Paphnutius, seeing him approach, fell on his knees, his heart\n      torn by fear and hope.",
                "\"My father! my father!\" he cried in his agony. \"My father! come to my\n      help, for I perish. I have given to God the soul of Thais; I have lived\n      upon the top of a column, and in the chamber of a tomb. My forehead,\n      unceasingly in the dust, has become horny as a camel's knee. And yet God\n      has gone from me. Bless me, my father, and I shall be saved; shake the\n      hyssop, and I shall be washed, and I shall shine as the snow.\"",
                "Anthony did not reply. He turned to the monks of Antinoe those eyes whose\n      looks no man could sustain.

                "Paul gazed vacantly from the zenith to the nadir, and from west to east,\n      when suddenly his eyes fell on the Abbot of Antinoe. His face grew pale\n      with a holy terror, and his eyeballs reflected invisible flames.",
                "\"I see,\" he murmured, \"three demons, who, full of joy, prepare to seize\n      that man. One of them is like unto a tower, one to a woman, and one to a\n      mage. All three bear their name, marked with red-hot iron; the first on\n      the forehead, the second on the belly, the third on the breast, and those\n      names are -- Pride, Lust, and Doubt. I have finished.\"",
                "Having spoken thus, Paul, with haggard eyes and hanging jaw, returned to\n      his old simple ways.",
                "And, as the monks of Antinoe looked anxiously at Anthony, the saint\n      pronounced these words --",
                "\"God has made known His just judgment. Let us bow to Him and hold our\n      peace.\"",
                "He passed. He bestowed blessings as he went. The sun, now descended to the\n      horizon, enveloped him in its glory, and his shadow, immeasurably\n      elongated by a miracle from heaven, unrolled itself behind him like an\n      endless carpet, as a sign of the long remembrance this great saint would\n      leave amongst men.",
                "Upright, but thunderstruck, Paphnutius saw and heard nothing more. One\n      word alone rang in his ears, \"Thais is dying!\" The thought had never\n      occurred to him. Twenty years had he contemplated a mummy's head, and yet\n      the idea that death would close the eyes of Thais astonished him\n      hopelessly.",
                "\"Thais is dying!\" An incomprehensible saying! \"Thais is dying!\" In those\n      three words what a new and terrible sense! \"Thais is dying!\" Then why the\n      sun, the flowers, the brooks, and all creation? \"Thais is dying!\" What\n      good was all the universe? Suddenly he sprang forward. \"To see her again,\n      to see her once more!\" He began to run. He knew not where he was, or\n      whither he went, but instinct conducted him with unerring certainty; he\n      went straight to the Nile. A swarm of sails covered the upper waters of\n      the river. He sprang on board a barque manned by Nubians, and lying in the\n      forepart of the boat, his eyes devouring space, he cried, in grief and\n      rage --",
                "\"Fool, fool, that I was, not to have possessed Thais whilst there was yet\n      time! Fool to have believed that there was anything else in the world but\n      her! Oh, madness! I dreamed of God, of the salvation of my soul, of life\n      eternal -- as if all that counted for anything when I had seen Thais!\n      Why did I not feel that blessed eternity was in a single kiss of that\n      woman, and that without her life was senseless, and no more than an evil\n      dream? Oh, stupid fool! thou hast seen her, and thou hast desired the good\n      things of the other world! Oh, coward! thou hast seen her, and thou hast\n      feared God! God! heaven! what are they? And what have they to offer thee\n      which are worth the least tittle of that which she would have given thee?\n      Oh, miserable, senseless fool, who sought divine goodness elsewhere than\n      on the lips of Thais! What hand was upon thy eyes? Cursed be he who\n      blinded thee then! Thou couldst have bought, at the price of thy\n      damnation, one moment of her love, and thou hast not done it! She opened\n      to thee her arms -- flesh mingled with the perfume of flowers -- and\n      thou wast not engulfed in the unspeakable enchantments of her unveiled\n      breast. Thou hast listened to the jealous voice which said to thee,\n      'Refrain!' Dupe, dupe, miserable dupe! Oh, regrets! Oh, remorse! Oh,\n      despair! Not to have the joy to carry to hell the memory of that\n      never-to-be-forgotten hour, and to cry to God, 'Burn my flesh, dry up all\n      the blood in my veins, break all my bones, thou canst not take from me the\n      remembrance which sweetens and refreshes me for ever and ever!' . . .\n      Thais is dying! Preposterous God, if thou knewest how I laugh at Thy hell!\n      Thais is dying, and she will never be mine -- never! never!\"",
                "And as the boat came down the river with the current, he remained whole\n      days lying on his face, and repeating --",
                "\"Never! never! never!\"",
                "Then, at the idea that she had given herself to others, and not to him;\n      that she had poured forth an ocean of love, and he had not wetted his lips\n      therein, he stood up, savagely wild, and howled with grief. He tore his\n      breast with his nails, and bit the flesh of his arms. He thought --",
                "\"If I could but kill all those she has loved!\"",
                "The idea of these murders filled him with delicious fury. He dreamed of\n      killing Nicias slowly and leisurely, looking him full in the eyes whilst\n      he murdered him. Then suddenly his fury melted away. He wept, he sobbed.\n      He became feeble and meek. An unknown tenderness softened his soul. He\n      longed to throw his arms round the neck of the companion of his childhood\n      and say to him, \"Nicias, I love thee, because thou hast loved her. Talk to\n      me about her. Tell me what she said to thee.\" And still, without ceasing,\n      the iron of that phrase entered into his soul -- \"Thais is dying!\"",
                "\"Light of day, silvery shadows of night stars, heavens, trees with\n      trembling crests, savage beasts, domestic animals, all the anxious souls\n      of men, do you not hear? 'Thais is dying!' Disappear, ye lights, breezes,\n      and perfumes! Hide yourselves, ye shapes and thoughts of the universe!\n      'Thais is dying!' She was the beauty of the world, and all that drew near\n      to her grew fairer in the reflection of her grace. The old man and the\n      sages who sat near her, at the banquet at Alexandria, how pleasant they\n      were, and how fascinating was their conversation! A host of brilliant\n      thoughts sprang to their lips, and all their ideas were steeped in\n      pleasure. And it was because the breath of Thais was on them that all they\n      said was love, beauty, truth. A delightful impiety lent its grace to their\n      discourse. They thoroughly expressed all human splendour. Alas! all that\n      is but a dream. Thais is dying! Oh, how easy it will be to me to die of\n      her death! But canst thou only die, withered embryo, fetus steeped in gall\n      and scalding tears? Miserable abortion, dost thou think thou canst taste\n      death, thou who hast never known life? If only God exists, that he may\n      damn me. I hope for it -- I wish it. God, I hate Thee -- dost Thou\n      hear? Overwhelm me with Thy damnation. To compel Thee to, I spit in Thy\n      face. I must find an eternal hell, to exhaust the eternity of rage which\n      consumes me.\"",
                "The next day, at dawn, Albina received the Abbot of Antinoe at the\n      nunnery.",
                "\"Thou art welcome to our tabernacles of peace, venerable father, for no\n      doubt, thou comest to bless the saint thou hast given us. Thou knowest\n      that God, in his mercy, has called her to Him; how couldst thou fail to\n      know tidings that the angels have carried from desert to desert? It is\n      true that Thais is about to meet her blessed death. Her labours are\n      accomplished, and I ought to inform thee, in a few words, as to her\n      conduct whilst she was still amongst us. After thy departure, when she was\n      confined in a cell sealed with thy seal, I sent her, with her food, a\n      flute, similar to those which girls of her profession play at banquets. I\n      did that to prevent her from falling into a melancholy mood, and that she\n      should not show less skill and talent before God than she had shown before\n      men. In this I showed prudence and foresight, for all day long Thais\n      praised the Lord upon the flute, and the virgins, who were attracted by\n      the sound of this invisible flute, said, 'We hear the nightingale of the\n      heavenly groves, the dying swan of Jesus crucified.' Thus did Thais\n      perform her penance, when, after sixty days, the door which thou hadst\n      sealed opened of itself, and the clay seal was broken without being\n      touched by any human hand. By that sign I knew that the trial thou hadst\n      imposed upon her was at an end, and that God had pardoned the sins of the\n      flute-player. From that time she has shared the ordinary life of my nuns,\n      working and praying with them. She was an example to them by the modesty\n      of her acts and words, and seemed like a statue of purity amongst them.\n      Sometimes she was sad; but those clouds soon passed. When I saw that she\n      was really drawn towards God by faith, hope, and love, I did not hesitate\n      to employ her talent, and even her beauty, for the improvement of her\n      sisters. I asked her to represent before us the actions of the famous\n      women and wise virgins of the Scriptures. She acted Esther, Deborah,\n      Judith, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and Mary, the mother of Jesus. I\n      know, venerable father, that thy austere mind is alarmed at the idea of\n      these performances. But thou thyself wouldest have been touched if thou\n      hadst seen her in these pious scenes, shedding real tears, and raising to\n      heaven arms graceful as palm leaves. I have long governed a community of\n      women, and I make it a rule never to oppose their nature. All seeds give\n      not the same flowers. Not all souls are sanctified in the same way. It\n      must also not be forgotten that Thais gave herself to God whilst she was\n      still beautiful, and such a sacrifice is, if not unexampled, at least very\n      rare. This beauty -- her natural vesture -- has not left her during\n      the three months' fever of which she is dying. As, during her illness, she\n      has incessantly asked to see the sky, I have her carried every morning\n      into the courtyard, near the well, under the old fig tree, in the shade of\n      which the abbesses of this convent are accustomed to hold their meetings.\n      Thou wilt find her there, venerable father; but hasten, for God calls her,\n      and this night a shroud will cover that face which God made both to shame\n      and to edify this world.\"",
                "Paphnutius followed her into a courtyard flooded with the morning light.\n      On the edge of the brick roofs, the pigeons formed a string of pearls. On\n      a bed, in the shade of the fig tree, Thais lay quite white, her arms\n      crossed. By her side stood veiled women, reciting the prayers for the\n      dying.",
                "\"Have mercy, upon me, O God, according to Thy loving kindness:\n      according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my\n      transgressions.\"",
                "He called her --",
                "\"Thais!\"",
                "She raised her eyelids, and turned the whites of her eyes in the direction\n      of the voice.",
                "Albina made a sign to the veiled women to retire a few paces.",
                "\"Thais!\" repeated the monk.",
                "She raised her head; a light breath came from her pale lips.",
                "\"Is it thou, my father? . . . Dost thou remember the water of the spring,\n      and the dates that we picked? . . . That day, my father, love was born in\n      my heart -- the love of life eternal.\"",
                "She was silent, and her head fell back.",
                "Death was upon her, and the sweat of the last agony bedewed her forehead.\n      A pigeon broke the still silence with its plaintive cooing. Then the sobs\n      of the monk mingled with the psalms of the virgins.",
                "\"Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For\n      I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.\"",
                "Suddenly Thais sat up in the bed. Her violet eyes opened wide, and with a\n      rapt gaze, her arms stretched towards the distant hills, she said in a\n      clear, fresh voice --",
                "\"Behold them -- the roses of the eternal dawn!\"",
                "Her eyes shone; a slight flush suffused her face. She had revived, more\n      sweet and more beautiful than ever. Paphnutius knelt down, and threw his\n      long black arms around her.",
                "\"Do not die!\" he cried, in a strange voice, which he himself did not\n      recognise. \"I love thee! Do not die! Listen, my Thais. I have deceived\n      thee? I was but a wretched fool. God, heaven -- all that is nothing.\n      There is nothing true but this worldly life, and the love of human beings.\n      I love thee! Do not die! That would be impossible -- thou art too\n      precious! Come, come with me! Let us fly? I will carry thee far away in my\n      arms. Come, let us love! Hear me, O my beloved, and say, 'I will live; I\n      wish to live.' Thais, Thais, arise!\"",
                "She did not hear him. Her eyes gazed into infinity.",
                "She murmured --",
                "\"Heaven opens. I see the angels, the prophets, and the saints. . . . The\n      good Theodore is amongst them, his hands filled with flowers; he smiles on\n      me and calls me. . . . Two angels come to me. They draw near. . . . How\n      beautiful they are! I see God!\"",
                "She uttered a joyful sigh, and her head fell back motionless on the\n      pillow. Thais was dead.",
                "Paphnutius held her in a last despairing embrace; his eyes devoured her\n      with desire, rage, and love.",
                "Albina cried to him --",
                "\"Avaunt, accursed wretch!\"",
                "And she gently placed her fingers on the eyelids of the dead girl.\n      Paphnutius staggered back, his eyes burning with flames and feeling the\n      earth open beneath his feet.",
