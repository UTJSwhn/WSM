                "public personage, who stands out on Fourteenth Street, New York,\nwearing a gorgeous light-blue coat of numerous brass buttons.\nHe nods to all the patrons, and his nod is the most cordial\nin town.  Mr. Wrenn used to trot down to Fourteenth Street,\npassing ever so many other shows, just to get that cordial nod,\nbecause he had a lonely furnished room for evenings, and for\ndaytime a tedious job that always made his head stuffy.\n",
                "He stands out in the correspondence of the Souvenir and Art\nNovelty Company as \"Our Mr. Wrenn,\" who would be writing you\ndirectly and explaining everything most satisfactorily.\nAt thirty-four Mr. Wrenn was the sales-entry clerk of the\nSouvenir Company.  He was always bending over bills and columns\nof figures at a desk behind the stock-room.  He was a meek little\nbachlor--a person of inconspicuous blue ready-made suits, and a\nsmall unsuccessful mustache.\n",
                "To-day--historians have established the date as April 9,\n1910--there had been some confusing mixed orders from the\nWisconsin retailers, and Mr. Wrenn had been \"called down\"\nby the office manager, Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle.  He needed\nthe friendly nod of the Nickelorion ticket-taker.  He found\nFourteenth Street, after office hours, swept by a dusty\nwind that whisked the skirts of countless plump Jewish girls,\nwhose V-necked blouses showed soft throats of a warm brown.\nUnder the elevated station he secretly made believe that he was\nin Paris, for here beautiful Italian boys swayed with trays of\nviolets; a tramp displayed crimson mechanical rabbits, which\nsqueaked, on silvery leading-strings; and a newsstand was heaped\nwith the orange and green and gold of magazine covers.\n",
                "\"Gee!\" inarticulated Mr. Wrenn.  \"Lots of colors.  Hope I see\nforeign stuff like that in the moving pictures.\"\n",
                "He came primly up to the Nickelorion, feeling in his vest\npockets for a nickel and peering around the booth at the\nfriendly ticket-taker.  But the latter was thinking about buying\nJohnny's pants.  Should he get them at the Fourteenth Street\nStore, or Siegel-Cooper's, or over at Aronson's, near home?\nSo ruminating, he twiddled his wheel mechanically, and Mr. Wrenn's\npasteboard slip was indifferently received in the plate-glass\ngullet of the grinder without the taker's even seeing the\nclerk's bow and smile.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn trembled into the door of the Nickelorion.  He wanted\nto turn back and rebuke this fellow, but was restrained by\nshyness.  He _had_ liked the man's \"Fine evenin', sir \"--rain\nor shine--but he wouldn't stand for being cut.  Wasn't he making\nnineteen dollars a week, as against the ticket-taker's ten\nor twelve?  He shook his head with the defiance of a cornered\nmouse, fussed with his mustache, and regarded the moving\npictures gloomily.\n",
                "They helped him.  After a Selig domestic drama came a stirring\nVitagraph Western scene, \"The Goat of the Rancho,\" which\ndepicted with much humor and tumult the revolt of a ranch cook,\na Chinaman.  Mr. Wrenn was really seeing, not cow-punchers and\nsage-brush, but himself, defying the office manager's surliness\nand revolting against the ticket-man's rudeness.  Now he was\nready for the nearly overpowering delight of travel-pictures.\nHe bounced slightly as a Gaumont film presented Java.\n",
                "He was a connoisseur of travel-pictures, for all his life he had\nbeen planning a great journey.  Though he had done Staten Island\nand patronized an excursion to Bound Brook, neither of these was\nhis grand tour.  It was yet to be taken.  In Mr. Wrenn,\napparently fastened to New York like a domestic-minded barnacle,\nlay the possibilities of heroic roaming.  He knew it.  He, too,\nlike the man who had taken the Gaumont pictures, would saunter\namong dusky Javan natives in \"markets with tiles on the roofs\nand temples and--and--uh, well--places!\"  The scent of Oriental\nspices was in his broadened nostrils as he scampered out of the\nNickelorion, without a look at the ticket-taker, and headed for\n\"home\"--for his third-floor-front on West Sixteenth Street.\nHe wanted to prowl through his collection of steamship brochures\nfor a description of Java.  But, of course, when one's landlady\nhas both the sciatica and a case of Patient Suffering one stops\nin the basement dining-room to inquire how she is.\n",
                "Mrs. Zapp was a fat landlady.  When she sat down there was\na straight line from her chin to her knees.  She was usually\nsitting down.  When she moved she groaned, and her apparel creaked.\nShe groaned and creaked from bed to breakfast, and ate five\ngriddle-cakes, two helpin's of scrapple, an egg, some rump steak,\nand three cups of coffee, slowly and resentfully.  She creaked\nand groaned from breakfast to her rocking-chair, and sat about\nwondering why Providence had inflicted upon her a weak digestion.\nMr. Wrenn also wondered why, sympathetically, but Mrs. Zapp was\ntoo conscientiously dolorous to be much cheered by the sympathy\nof a nigger-lovin' Yankee, who couldn't appreciate the subtle\nsorrows of a Zapp of Zapp's Bog, allied to all the First Families\nof Virginia.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn did nothing more presumptuous than sit still, in the\nstuffy furniture-crowded basement room, which smelled of dead\nfood and deader pride in a race that had never existed.  He sat\nstill because the chair was broken.  It had been broken now for\nfour years.\n",
                "For the hundred and twenty-ninth time in those years Mrs. Zapp\nsaid, in her rich corruption of Southern negro dialect, which\ncan only be indicated here, \"Ah been meaning to get that chair\nmended, Mist' Wrenn.\"  He looked gratified and gazed upon the\ncrayon enlargements of Lee Theresa, the older Zapp daughter (who\nwas forewoman in a factory), and of Godiva.  Godiva Zapp was\nusually called \"Goaty,\" and many times a day was she called by\nMrs. Zapp.  A tamed child drudge was Goaty, with adenoids, which\nMrs. Zapp had been meanin' to have removed, and which she would\ncontinue to have benevolent meanin's about till it should be too\nlate, and she should discover that Providence never would let\nGoaty go to school.\n",
                "\"Yes, Mist' Wrenn, Ah told Goaty she was to see the man about\ngetting that chair fixed, but she nev' does nothing Ah tell her.\"\n",
                "In the kitchen was the noise of Goaty, ungovernable Goaty, aged\neight, still snivelingly washing, though not cleaning, the\nincredible pile of dinner dishes.  With a trail of hesitating\nremarks on the sadness of sciatica and windy evenings Mr. Wrenn\nsneaked forth from the august presence of Mrs. Zapp and mounted\nto paradise--his third-floor-front.\n",
                "It was an abjectly respectable room--the bedspread patched;\nno two pieces of furniture from the same family; half-tones\nfrom the magazines pinned on the wall.  But on the old marble\nmantelpiece lived his friends, books from wanderland.\nOther friends the room had rarely known.  It was hard enough\nfor Mr. Wrenn to get acquainted with people, anyway, and Mrs.\nZapp did not expect her gennulman lodgers to entertain.  So Mr.\nWrenn had given up asking even Charley Carpenter, the assistant\nbookkeeper at the Souvenir Company, to call.  That left him the\nbooks, which he now caressed with small eager finger-tips.\nHe picked out a P. & O. circular, and hastily left for fairyland.\n",
                "The April skies glowed with benevolence this Saturday morning.\nThe Metropolitan Tower was singing, bright ivory tipped with\ngold, uplifted and intensely glad of the morning.  The buildings\nwalling in Madison Square were jubilant; the honest red-brick\nfronts, radiant; the new marble, witty.  The sparrows in the\nmiddle of Fifth Avenue were all talking at once, scandalously but\ncleverly.  The polished brass of limousines threw off teethy smiles.\nAt least so Mr. Wrenn fancied as he whisked up Fifth Avenue,\nthe skirts of his small blue double-breasted coat wagging.\nHe was going blocks out of his way to the office; ready to\ndefy time and eternity, yes, and even the office manager.\nHe had awakened with Defiance as his bedfellow, and\nthroughout breakfast at the hustler Dairy Lunch sunshine\nhad flickered over the dirty tessellated floor.\n",
                "He pranced up to the Souvenir Company's brick building, on\nTwenty-eighth Street near Sixth Avenue.  In the office he\nchuckled at his ink-well and the untorn blotters on his\norderly desk.  Though he sat under the weary unnatural brilliance\nof a mercury-vapor light, he dashed into his work, and was too\nkeen about this business of living merrily to be much flustered\nby the bustle of the lady buyer's superior \"_Good_ morning.\"\nEven up to ten-thirty he was still slamming down papers on\nhis desk.  Just let any one try to stop his course, his readiness\nfor snapping fingers at The Job; just let them _try_ it, that was\nall he wanted!\n",
                "Then he was shot out of his chair and four feet along the\ncorridor, in reflex response to the surly \"Bur-r-r-r-r\" of\nthe buzzer.  Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle, the manager, desired\nto see him.  He scampered along the corridor and slid\ndecorously through the manager's doorway into the long sun-bright\nroom, ornate with rugs and souvenirs.  Seven Novelties glittered\non the desk alone, including a large rococo Shakespeare-style\nglass ink-well containing cloves and a small iron Pittsburg-style\none containing ink.  Mr. Wrenn blinked like a noon-roused owlet\nin the brilliance.  The manager dropped his fist on the desk,\nglared, smoothed his flowered prairie of waistcoat, and growled,\nhis red jowls quivering:\n",
                "\"Look here, Wrenn, what's the matter with you?  The Bronx\nEmporium order for May Day novelties was filled twice, they\nwrite me.\"\n",
                "\"They ordered twice, sir.  By 'phone,\" smiled Mr. Wrenn, in an\nagony of politeness.\n",
                "\"They ordered hell, sir!  Twice--the same order?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, sir; their buyer was prob--\"\n",
                "\"They say they've looked it up.  Anyway, they won't pay twice.\nI know, em.  We'll have to crawl down graceful, and all because\nyou--I want to know why you ain't more careful!\"\n",
                "The announcement that Mr. Wrenn twice wriggled his head, and\nonce tossed it, would not half denote his wrath.  At last!\nIt was here--the time for revolt, when he was going to be defiant.\nHe had been careful; old Goglefogle was only barking; but why\nshould _he_ be barked at?  With his voice palpitating and his\nheart thudding so that he felt sick he declared:\n",
                "\"I'm _sure_, sir, about that order.  I looked it up.  Their buyer\nwas drunk!\"\n",
                "It was done.  And now would he be discharged?  The manager\nwas speaking:\n",
                "\"Probably.  You looked it up, eh?  Um!  Send me in the two\norder-records.  Well.  But, anyway, I want you to be more\ncareful after this, Wrenn.  You're pretty sloppy.  Now get out.\nExpect me to make firms pay twice for the same order, cause of\nyour carelessness?\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn found himself outside in the dark corridor.\nThe manager hadn't seemed much impressed by his revolt.\n",
                "The manager wasn't.  He called a stenographer and dictated:\n",
                "\"Bronx Emporium:\n",
                "\"GENTLEMEN:--Our Mr. Wrenn has again (underline that `again,'\nMiss Blaustein), again looked up your order for May Day novelties.\nAs we wrote before, order certainly was duplicated by 'phone.\nOur Mr. Wrenn is thoroughly reliable, and we have his records\nof these two orders.  We shall therefore have to push\ncollection on both--\"\n",
                "After all, Mr. Wrenn was thinking, the crafty manager might be\nmerely concealing his hand.  Perhaps he had understood the defiance.\nThat gladdened him till after lunch.  But at three, when his head\nwas again foggy with work and he had forgotten whether there was\nstill April anywhere, he began to dread what the manager might\ndo to him.  Suppose he lost his job; The Job!  He worked\nunnecessarily late, hoping that the manager would learn of it.\nAs he wavered home, drunk with weariness, his fear of losing\nThe Job was almost equal to his desire to resign from The Job.\n",
                "He had worked so late that when he awoke on Sunday morning he\nwas still in a whirl of figures.  As he went out to his\nbreakfast of coffee and whisked wheat at the Hustler Lunch the\nlines between the blocks of the cement walk, radiant in a white\nflare of sunshine, irritatingly recalled the cross-lines of\norder-lists, with the narrow cement blocks at the curb standing\nfor unfilled column-headings.  Even the ridges of the Hustler\nLunch's imitation steel ceiling, running in parallel lines,\njeered down at him that he was a prosaic man whose path was a ruler.\n",
                "He went clear up to the branch post-office after breakfast to\nget the Sunday mail, but the mail was a disappointment.\nHe was awaiting a wonderful fully illustrated guide to the\nLand of the Midnight Sun, a suggestion of possible and\ncoyly improbable trips, whereas he got only a letter from his\noldest acquaintance--Cousin John, of Parthenon, New York, the\nboy-who-comes-to-play of Mr. Wrenn's back-yard days in Parthenon.\nWithout opening the letter Mr. Wrenn tucked it into his inside coat\npocket, threw away his toothpick, and turned to Sunday wayfaring.\n",
                "He jogged down Twenty-third Street to the North River ferries afoot.\nTrolleys took money, and of course one saves up for future great\ntraveling.  Over him the April clouds were fetterless vagabonds\nwhose gaiety made him shrug with excitement and take a curb with\na frisk as gambolsome as a Central Park lamb.  There was no hint\nof sales-lists in the clouds, at least.  And with them Mr. Wrenn's\nsoul swept along, while his half-soled Cum-Fee-Best $3.80 shoes\nwere ambling past warehouses.  Only once did he condescend to\nbeing really on Twenty-third Street.  At the Ninth Avenue corner,\nunder the grimy Elevated, he sighted two blocks down to the\nGeneral Theological Seminary's brick Gothic and found in a\npointed doorway suggestions of alien beauty.\n",
                "But his real object was to loll on a West and South Railroad in\nluxury, and go sailing out into the foam and perilous seas of\nNorth River.  He passed through the smoking-cabin.  He didn't\nsmoke--the habit used up travel-money.  Once seated on the upper\ndeck, he knew that at last he was outward-bound on a liner.\nTrue, there was no great motion, but Mr. Wrenn was inclined to\nlet realism off easily in this feature of his voyage.  At least\nthere were undoubted life-preservers in the white racks\noverhead; and everywhere the world, to his certain witnessing,\nwas turned to crusading, to setting forth in great ships as if\nit were again in the brisk morning of history when the joy of\nadventure possessed the Argonauts.\n",
                "He wasn't excited over the liners they passed.  He was so\nexperienced in all of travel, save the traveling, as to have\ngained a calm interested knowledge.  He knew the _Campagnia_\nthree docks away, and explained to a Harlem grocer her fine\npoints, speaking earnestly of stacks and sticks, tonnage\nand knots.\n",
                "Not excited, but--where couldn't he go if he were pulling out\nfor Arcady on the _Campagnia!_ Gee!  What were even the\nbuilding-block towers of the Metropolitan and Singer buildings\nand the _Times's_ cream-stick compared with some old shrine in a\ncathedral close that was misted with centuries!\n",
                "All this he felt and hummed to himself, though not in words.\nHe had never heard of Arcady, though for many years he had\nbeen a citizen of that demesne.\n",
                "Sure, he declared to himself, he was on the liner now; he was\nsliding up the muddy Mersey (see the _W. S. Travel Notes_ for\nthe source of his visions); he was off to St. George's Square\nfor an organ-recital (see the English Baedeker); then an express\nfor London and--Gee!\n",
                "The ferryboat was entering her slip.  Mr. Wrenn trotted toward\nthe bow to thrill over the bump of the boat's snub nose against\nthe lofty swaying piles and the swash of the brown waves heaped\nbefore her as she sidled into place.  He was carried by the herd\non into the station.\n",
                "He did not notice the individual people in his exultation as he\nheard the great chords of the station's paean.  The vast roof\nroared as the iron coursers stamped titanic hoofs of scorn at\nthe little stay-at-home.\n",
                "That is a washed-out hint of how the poets might describe Mr.\nWrenn's passion.  What he said was \"Gee!\"\n",
                "He strolled by the lists of destinations hung on the track gates.\nChicago (the plains! the Rockies! sunset over mining-camps!),\nWashington, and the magic Southland--thither the iron horses\nwould be galloping, their swarthy smoke manes whipped back by\nthe whirlwind, pounding out with clamorous strong hoofs their\nsixty miles an hour.  Very well.  In time he also would mount\nupon the iron coursers and charge upon Chicago and the\nSouthland; just as soon as he got ready.\n",
                "Then he headed for Cortlandt Street; for Long Island, City.\nfinally, the Navy Yard.  Along his way were the docks of the\ntramp steamers where he might ship as steward in the\nall-promising Sometime.  He had never done anything so reckless\nas actually to ask a skipper for the chance to go a-sailing, but\nhe had once gone into a mission society's free shipping-office\non West Street where a disapproving elder had grumped at him,\n\"Are you a sailor?  No?  Can't do anything for you, my friend.\nAre you saved?\"  He wasn't going to risk another horror like\nthat, yet when the golden morning of Sometime dawned he\ncertainly was going to go cruising off to palm-bordered lagoons.\n",
                "As he walked through Long Island City he contrived conversations\nwith the sailors he passed.  It would have surprised a Norwegian\nbos'un's mate to learn that he was really a gun-runner, and\nthat, as a matter of fact, he was now telling yarns of the\nSpanish Main to the man who slid deprecatingly by him.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn envied the jackies on the training-ship and carelessly\nwent to sea as the President's guest in the admiral's barge and\nwas frightened by the stare of a sauntering shop-girl and\narrived home before dusk, to Mrs. Zapp's straitened approval.\n",
                "Dusk made incantations in his third-floor-front.  Pleasantly\nfagged in those slight neat legs, after his walk, Mr. Wrenn sat\nin the wicker rocker by the window, patting his scrubby tan\nmustache and reviewing the day's wandering.  When the gas was\nlighted he yearned over pictures in a geographical magazine for\na happy hour, then yawned to himself, \"Well-l-l, Willum, guess\nit's time to crawl into the downy.\"\n",
                "He undressed and smoothed his ready-made suit on the\nrocking-chair back.  Sitting on the edge of his bed, quaint in\nhis cotton night-gown, like a rare little bird of dull plumage,\nhe rubbed his head sleepily.  Um-m-m-m-m!  How tired he was!\nHe went to open the window.  Then his tamed heart leaped into a\nwaltz, and he forgot third-floor-fronts and sleepiness.\n",
                "Through the window came the chorus of fog-horns on North River.\n\"Boom-m-m!\" That must be a giant liner, battling up through the\nfog.  (It was a ferry.)  A liner!  She'd be roaring just like that\nif she were off the Banks!  If he were only off the Banks!  \"Toot!\nToot!\" That was a tug.  \"Whawn-n-n!\"  Another liner.  The tumultuous\nchorus repeated to him all the adventures of the day.\n",
                "He dropped upon the bed again and stared absently at his\nclothes.  Out of the inside coat pocket stuck the unopened\nletter from Cousin John.\n",
                "He read a paragraph of it.  He sprang from the bed and danced a\ntarantella, pranced in his cottony nightgown like a drunken\nYaqui.  The letter announced that the flinty farm at Parthenon,\nleft to Mr. Wrenn by his father, had been sold.  Its location on\na river bluff had made it valuable to the Parthenon Chautauqua\nAssociation.  There was now to his credit in the Parthenon\nNational Bank nine hundred and forty dollars!\n",
                "He was wealthy, then.  He had enough to stalk up and down the\nearth for many venturesome (but economical) months, till he\nshould learn the trade of wandering, and its mysterious trick of\nliving without a job or a salary.\n",
                "He crushed his pillow with burrowing head and sobbed excitedly,\nwith a terrible stomach-sinking and a chill shaking.  Then he\nlaughed and wanted to--but didn't--rush into the adjacent hall\nroom and tell the total stranger there of this world-changing news.\nHe listened in the hall to learn whether the Zapps were up,\nbut heard nothing; returned and cantered up and down, gloating\non a map of the world.\n",
                "\"Gee!  It's happened.  I could travel all the time.  I guess I\nwon't be--very much--afraid of wrecks and stuff. . . .  Things like\nthat. . . .  Gee!  If I don't get to bed I'll be late at the\noffice in the morning!\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn lay awake till three o'clock.  Monday morning he felt\nrather ashamed of having done so eccentric a thing.  But he got\nto the office on time.  He was worried with the cares of wealth,\nwith having to decide when to leave for his world-wanderings,\nbut he was also very much aware that office managers are\ndisagreeable if one isn't on time.  All morning he did nothing\nmore reckless than balance his new fortune, plus his savings,\nagainst steamship fares on a waste half-sheet of paper.\n",
                "The noon-hour was not The Job's, but his, for exploration of the\nparlous lands of romance that lie hard by Twenty-eighth Street\nand Sixth Avenue.  But he had to go out to lunch with Charley\nCarpenter, the assistant bookkeeper, that he might tell the news.\nAs for Charley, He needed frequently to have a confidant who knew\npersonally the tyrannous ways of the office manager, Mr. Guilfogle.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn and Charley chose (that is to say, Charley chose)\na table at Drubel's Eating House.  Mr. Wrenn timidly hinted,\n\"I've got some big news to tell you.\"\n",
                "But Charley interrupted, \"Say, did you hear old Goglefogle light\ninto me this morning?  I won't stand for it.  Say, did you hear\nhim--the old--\"\n",
                "\"What was the trouble, Charley?\"\n",
                "\"Trouble?  Nothing was the trouble.  Except with old Goglefogle.\nI made one little break in my accounts.  Why, if old Gogie had\nto keep track of seventy-'leven accounts and watch every single\nlast movement of a fool girl that can't even run the adding-machine,\nwhy, he'd get green around the gills.  He'd never do anything\n_but_ make mistakes!  Well, I guess the old codger must have had\na bum breakfast this morning.  Wanted some exercise to digest it.\nMe, I was the exercise--I was the goat.  He calls me in, and he\ncalls me _down_, and me--well, just lemme tell you, Wrenn,\nI calls his bluff!\"\n",
                "Charley Carpenter stopped his rapid tirade, delivered with quick\nhead-shakes like those of palsy, to raise his smelly cigarette\nto his mouth.  Midway in this slow gesture the memory of his\nwrongs again overpowered him.  He flung his right hand back on\nthe table, scattering cigarette ashes, jerked back his head with\nthe irritated patience of a nervous martyr, then waved both\nhands about spasmodically, while he snarled, with his cheaply\nhandsome smooth face more flushed than usual:\n",
                "\"Sure!  You can just bet your bottom dollar I let him see from\nthe way I looked at him that I wasn't going to stand for no more\nmonkey business.  You bet I did!...  I'll fix him, I will.\nYou just _watch_ me.  (Hey, Drubel, got any lemon merang?  Bring me\na hunk, will yuh?)  Why, Wrenn, that cross-eyed double-jointed\nfat old slob, I'll slam him in the slats so hard some day--I\nwill, you just watch my smoke.  If it wasn't for that messy wife\nof mine--I ought to desert her, and I will some day, and--\"\n",
                "\"Yuh.\"  Mr. Wrenn was curt for a second....  \"I know how it is, Charley.\nBut you'll get over it, honest you will.  Say, I've got some news.\nSome land that my dad left me has sold for nearly a thousand plunks.\nBy the way, this lunch is on me.  Let me pay for it, Charley.\"\n",
                "Charley promised to let him pay, quite readily.  And, expanding, said:\n",
                "\"Great, Wrenn!  Great!  Lemme congratulate you.  Don't know\nanybody I'd rather've had this happen to.  You're a meek little\nbaa-lamb, but you've got lots of stuff in you, old Wrennski.\nOh say, by the way, could. you let me have fifty cents till\nSaturday?  Thanks.   I'll pay it back sure.  By golly! you're\nthe only man around the office that 'preciates what a double\nduck-lined old fiend old Goglefogle is, the old--\"\n",
                "\"Aw, gee, Charley, I wish you wouldn't jump on Guilfogle\nso hard.  He's always treated me square.\"\n",
                "\"Gogie--square?  Yuh, he's square just like a hoop.  You know it,\ntoo, Wrenn.  Now that you've got enough money so's you don't\nneed to be scared about the job you'll realize it, and you'll\nwant to soak him, same's I do.  _Say!_\"  The impulse of a great\nidea made him gleefully shake his fist sidewise.  \"Say!\nWhy _don't_ you soak him?  They bank on you at the Souvenir\nCompany.  Darn' sight more than you realize, lemme tell you.\nWhy, you do about half the stock-keeper's work, sides your own.\nTell you what you do.  You go to old Goglefogle and tell him you\nwant a raise to twenty-five, and want it right now.  Yes, by\ngolly, _thirty!_ You're worth that, or pretty darn' near it, but\n'course old Goglefogle'll never give it to you.  He'll threaten\nto fire you if you say a thing more about it.  You can tell him\nto go ahead, and then where'll he be?  Guess that'll call his\nbluff some!\"\n",
                "\"Yes, but, Charley, then if Guilfogle feels he can't pay me that\nmuch--you know he's responsible to the directors; he can't do\neverything he wants to--why, he'll just have to fire me, after\nI've talked to him like that, whether he wants to or not.\nAnd that'd leave us--that'd leave them--without a sales clerk,\nright in the busy season.\"\n",
                "\"Why, sure, Wrenn; that's what we want to do.  If you go it 'd\nleave 'em without just about _two_ men.  Bother 'em like the deuce.\nIt 'd bother Mr. Mortimer X. Y. Guglefugle most of all,\nthank the Lord.  He wouldn't know where he was at--trying to\nbreak in a man right in the busy season.  Here's your chance.\nCome on, kid; don't pass it up.\"\n",
                "\"Oh gee, Charley, I can't do that.  You wouldn't want me to try\nto _hurt_ the Souvenir Company after being there for--lemme see,\nit must be seven years.\"\n",
                "\"Well, maybe you _like_ to get your cute little nose rubbed on\nthe grindstone! I suppose you'd like to stay on at nineteen per\nfor the rest of your life.\"\n",
                "\"Aw, Charley, don't get sore; please don't!  I'd like to get off,\nall right--like to go traveling, and stuff like that. Gee!  I'd\nlike to wander round.  But I can't cut out right in the bus--\"\n",
                "\"But can't you see, you poor nut, you won't be _leaving_\n'em--they'll either pay you what they ought to or lose you.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I don't know about that, Charley.\n",
                "\"Charley was making up for some uncertainty as to his own\nlogic by beaming persuasiveness, and Mr. Wrenn was afraid\nof being hypnotized.  \"No, no!\" he throbbed, rising.\n",
                "\"Well, all right!\" snarled Charley, \"if you like to be Gogie's\ngoat....  Oh, you're all right, Wrennski.  I suppose you had\nought to stay, if you feel you got to....  Well, so long.\nI've got to beat it over and buy a pair of socks before I go back.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn crept out of Drubel's behind him, very melancholy.\nEven Charley admitted that he \"had ought to stay,\" then; and\nwhat chance was there of persuading the dread Mr. Mortimer R.\nGuilfogle that he wished to be looked upon as one resigning?\nWhere, then, any chance of globe-trotting; perhaps for months he\nwould remain in slavery, and he had hoped just that morning--\nOne dreadful quarter-hour with Mr. Guilfogle and he might be free.\nHe grinned to himself as he admitted that this was like\nseeing Europe after merely swimming the mid-winter Atlantic.\n",
                "Well, he had nine minutes more, by his two-dollar watch; nine\nminutes of vagabondage.  He gazed across at a Greek restaurant\nwith signs in real Greek letters like \"ruins at--well, at Aythens.\"\nA Chinese chop-suey den with a red-and-yellow carved dragon,\nand at an upper window a squat Chinaman who might easily\nbe carrying a _kris_, \"or whatever them Chink knives are,\" as he\nobserved for the hundredth time he had taken this journey.\nA rotisserie, before whose upright fender of scarlet coals whole\nducks were happily roasting to a shiny brown. In a furrier's\nwindow were Siberian foxes' skins (Siberia! huts of \"awful\nbrave convicks\"; the steely Northern Sea; guards in blouses,\njust as he'd seen them at an Academy of Music play) and a polar\nbear (meaning, to him, the Northern Lights, the long hike,\nand the _igloo_ at night).  And the florists!  There were orchids\nthat (though he only half knew it, and that all inarticulately)\nwhispered to him of jungles where, in the hot hush, he saw the\nslumbering python and--\"What was it in that poem, that,\nMandalay, thing? _was_ it about jungles?  Anyway:\n",
                "\"'Them garlicky smells,\nAnd the sunshine and the palms and the bells.'\"\n",
                "He had to hurry back to the office.  He stopped only to pat the\nhead of a florist's delivery horse that looked wistfully at him\nfrom the curb.  \"Poor old fella.  What you thinking about?\nWant to be a circus horse and wander?  Le's beat it together.\nYou can't, eh?  Poor old fella!\"\n",
                "At three-thirty, the time when it seems to office persons that\nthe day's work never will end, even by a miracle, Mr. Wrenn was\nshaky about his duty to the firm.  He was more so after an\nelectrical interview with the manager, who spent a few minutes,\nwhich he happened to have free, in roaring \"I want to know why\"\nat Mr. Wrenn.  There was no particular \"why\" that he wanted to\nknow; he was merely getting scientific efficiency out of\nemployees, a phrase which Mr. Guilfogle had taken from a\nbusiness magazine that dilutes efficiency theories for\ninefficient employers.\n",
                "At five-twenty the manager summoned him, complimented him on\nnothing in particular, and suggested that he stay late with\nCharley Carpenter and the stock-keeper to inventory a line of\ndesk-clocks which they were closing out.\n",
                "As Mr. Wrenn returned to his desk he stopped at a window on the\ncorridor and coveted the bright late afternoon.  The cornices of\nlofty buildings glistened; the sunset shone fierily through the\nglass-inclosed layer-like upper floors.  He wanted to be out\nthere in the streets with the shopping crowds.  Old Goglefogle\ndidn't consider him; why should he consider the firm?\n"

                "As he left the Souvenir Company building after working late at\ntaking inventory and roamed down toward Fourteenth Street, Mr.\nWrenn felt forlornly aimless.  The worst of it all was that he\ncould not go to the Nickelorion for moving pictures; not after\nhaving been cut by the ticket-taker.  Then, there before him was\nthe glaring sign of the Nickelorion tempting him; a bill with\n\"Great Train Robbery Film Tonight\" made his heart thump like\nstair-climbing--and he dashed at the ticket-booth with a nickel\ndoughtily extended.  He felt queer about the scalp as the\ncashier girl slid out a coupon.  Why did she seem to be watching\nhim so closely?  As he dropped the ticket in the chopper he\ntried to glance away from the Brass-button Man.  For one-\nnineteenth of a second he kept his head turned.  It turned\nback of itself; he stared full at the man, half bowed--and\nreceived a hearty absent-minded nod and a \"Fine evenin'.\"\nHe sang to himself a monotonous song of great joy.  When he\nstumbled over the feet of a large German in getting to a seat,\nhe apologized as though he were accustomed to laugh easily with\nmany friends.\n",
                "The train-robbery film was--well, he kept repeating \"Gee!\" to\nhimself pantingly.  How the masked men did sneak, simply sneak\nand sneak, behind the bushes!  Mr. Wrenn shrank as one of them\nleered out of the picture at him.  How gallantly the train\ndashed toward the robbers, to the spirit-stirring roll of the\nsnare-drum.  The rush from the bushes followed; the battle with\ndetectives concealed in the express-car.  Mr. Wrenn was\nstanding sturdily and shooting coolly with the slender\nhawk-faced Pinkerton man in puttees; with him he leaped to horse\nand followed the robbers through the forest.  He stayed through\nthe whole program twice to see the train robbery again.\n",
                "As he started to go out he found the ticket-taker changing his\nlong light-blue robe of state for a highly commonplace sack-coat\nwithout brass buttons.  In his astonishment at seeing how a\nHighness could be transformed into an every-day man, Mr. Wrenn\nstopped, and, having stopped, spoke:\n",
                "\"Uh--that was quite a--quite a picture--that train robbery.\nWasn't it.\"\n",
                "\"Yuh, I guess--Now where's the devil and his wife flew away\nto with my hat?  Them guys is always swiping it.  Picture,\nmister?  Why, I didn't see it no more 'n--Say you, Pink Eye,\nsay you crab-footed usher, did you swipe my hat?  Ain't he the\ncut-up, mister! Ain't both them ushers the jingling sheepsheads,\nthough!  Being cute and hiding my hat in the box-office.\n_Picture?_  I don't get no chance to see any of 'em.  Funny,\nain't it?--me barking for 'em like I was the grandmother of the\nguy that invented 'em, and not knowing whether the train\nrobbery--Now who stole my going-home shoes?... Why, I don't\nknow whether the train did any robbing or not!\"\n",
                "He slapped Mr. Wrenn on the back, and the sales clerk's heart\nbounded in comradeship.  He was surprised into declaring:\n",
                "\"Say--uh--I bowed to you the other night and you--well, honestly,\nyou acted like you never saw me.\"\n",
                "\"Well, well, now, and that's what happens to me for being the\ndad of five kids and a she-girl and a tom-cat.  Sure, I couldn't\n've seen you.  Me, I was probably that busy with fambly cares--I\nwas probably thinking who was it et the lemon pie on me--was it Pete\nor Johnny, or shall I lick 'em both together, or just bite me wife.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn knew that the ticket-taker had never, never really\nconsidered biting his wife.  _He_ knew!  His nod and grin and\n\"That's the idea!\" were urbanely sophisticated.  He urged:\n",
                "\"Oh yes, I'm sure you didn't intend to hand me the icy mitt.\nSay!  I'm thirsty.  Come on over to Moje's and I'll buy you a drink.\"\n",
                "He was aghast at this abyss of money-spending into which he had\nleaped, and the Brass-button Man was suspiciously wondering what\nthis person wanted of him; but they crossed to the adjacent\nsaloon, a New York corner saloon, which of course \"glittered\"\nwith a large mirror, heaped glasses, and a long shining\nfoot-rail on which, in bravado, Mr. Wrenn placed his\nCum-Fee-Best shoe.\n",
                "\"Uh?\" said the bartender.\n",
                "\"Rye, Jimmy,\" said the Brass-button Man.\n",
                "\"Uh-h-h-h-h,\" said Mr. Wrenn, in a frightened diminuendo, now\nthat--wealthy citizen though he had become--he was in danger of\nexposure as a mollycoddle who couldn't choose his drink properly.\n\"Stummick been hurting me.  Guess I'd better just take a lemonade.\"\n",
                "\"You're the brother-in-law to a wise one,\" commented the\nBrass-button Man.  \"Me, I ain't never got the sense to do the\ntraffic cop on the booze.  The old woman she says to me, `Mory,'\nshe says, `if you was in heaven and there was a pail of beer on\none side and a gold harp on the other,' she says, `and you was\nto have your pick, which would you take?' And what 'd yuh think\nI answers her?\"\n",
                "\"The beer,\" said the bartender.  \"She had your number, all right.\"\n",
                "\"Not on your tin-type,\" declared the ticket-taker.\n",
                "\"`Me?' I says to her.  `Me?  I'd pinch the harp and pawn it for\nten growlers of Dutch beer and some man-sized rum!'\"\n",
                "\"Hee, hee hee!\" grinned Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "\"Ha, ha, ha!\" grumbled the bartender.\n",
                "\"Well-l-l,\" yawned the ticket-taker, \"the old woman'll be\nchasing me best pants around the flat, if she don't have me to\nchase, pretty soon.  Guess I'd better beat it.  Much obliged for\nthe drink, Mr. Uh.  So long, Jimmy.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn set off for home in a high state of exhilaration\nwhich, he noticed, exactly resembled driving an aeroplane, and\nwent briskly up the steps of the Zapps' genteel but unexciting\nresidence.  He was much nearer to heaven than West Sixteenth\nStreet appears to be to the outsider.  For he was an explorer of\nthe Arctic, a trusted man on the job, an associate of witty\nBohemians.  He was an army lieutenant who had, with his friend\nthe hawk-faced Pinkerton man, stood off bandits in an attack\non a train.  He opened and closed the door gaily.\n",
                "He was an apologetic little Mr. Wrenn.  His landlady stood\non the bottom step of the hall stairs in a bunchy Mother\nHubbard, groaning:\n",
                "\"Mist' Wrenn, if you got to come in so late, Ah wish you\nwouldn't just make all the noise you can.  Ah don't see why Ah\nshould have to be kept awake all night.  Ah suppose it's the\nwill of the Lord that whenever Ah go out to see Mrs. Muzzy and\njust drink a drop of coffee Ah must get insomina, but Ah don't\nsee why anybody that tries to be a gennulman should have to go\nand bang the door and just rack mah nerves.\"\n",
                "He slunk up-stairs behind Mrs. Zapp's lumbering gloom.\n",
                "\"There's something I wanted to tell you, Mrs. Zapp--something\nthat's happened to me.  That's why I was out celebrating last\nevening and got in so late.\"  Mr. Wrenn was diffidently sitting\nin the basement.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" dryly, \"Ah noticed you was out late, Mist' Wrenn.\"\n",
                "\"You see, Mrs. Zapp, I--uh--my father left me some land, and\nit's been sold for about one thousand plunks.\"\n",
                "\" Ah'm awful' glad, Mist' Wrenn,\" she said, funereally.  \"Maybe\nyou'd like to take that hall room beside yours now.  The two\nrooms'd make a nice apartment.\"  (She really said \"nahs\n'pahtmun', \"you understand.)\n",
                "\"Why, I hadn't thought much about that yet.\" He felt guilty, and\nwas profusely cordial to Lee Theresa Zapp, the factory\nforewoman, who had just thumped down-stairs.\n",
                "Miss Theresa was a large young lady with a bust, much black\nhair, and a handsome disdainful discontented face.  She waited\ntill he had finished greeting her, then sniffed, and at her\nmother she snarled:\n",
                "\"Ma, they went and kept us late again to-night.  I'm getting\njust about tired of having a bunch of Jews and Yankees think I'm\na nigger.  Uff!  I hate them!\"\n",
                "\"T'resa, Mist' Wrenn's just inherited two thousand dollars, and\nhe's going to take that upper hall room.\"  Mrs. Zapp beamed with\nmaternal fondness at the timid lodger.\n",
                "But the gallant friend of Pinkertons faced her--for the first\ntime.  \"Waste his travel-money?\" he was inwardly exclaiming as\nhe said:\n",
                "\"But I thought you had some one in that room.  I heard som--\"\n",
                "\"That fellow!  Oh, he ain't going to be perm'nent.  And he\npromised me--So you can have--\"\n",
                "\"I'm _awful_ sorry, Mrs. Zapp, but I'm afraid I can't take it.\nFact is, I may go traveling for a while.\"\n",
                "\"Co'se you'll keep your room if you do, Mist' Wrenn?\"\n",
                "\"Why, I'm afraid I'll have to give it up, but--Oh, I may not be\ngoing for a long long while yet; and of course I'll be glad to\ncome--I'll want to come back here when I get back to New York.\nI won't be gone for more than, oh, probably not more than a year\nanyway, and--\"\n",
                "\"And Ah thought you said you was going to be perm'nent!\" Mrs.\nZapp began quietly, prefatory to working herself up into\nhysterics.  \"And here Ah've gone and had your room fixed up\njust for you, and new paper put in, and you've always been\ntalking such a lot about how you wanted your furniture arranged,\nand Ah've gone and made all mah plans--\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn had been a shyly paying guest of the Zapps for four\nyears.  That famous new paper had been put up two years before.\nSo he spluttered:  \"Oh, I'm _awfully_ sorry.  I wish--uh--I\ndon't--\"\n",
                "\"Ah'd _thank_ you, Mist' Wrenn, if you could _conveniently_ let me\n_know_ before you go running off and leaving me with empty rooms,\nwith the landlord after the rent, and me turning away people\nthat 'd pay more for the room, because Ah wanted to keep it for\nyou.  And people always coming to see you and making me answer\nthe door and--\"\n",
                "Even the rooming-house worm was making small worm-like sounds\nthat presaged turning.  Lee Theresa snapped just in time, \"Oh,\ncut it out, Ma, will you!\"  She had been staring at the worm, for\nhe had suddenly become interesting and adorable and,\nincidentally, an heir.  \"I don't see why Mr. Wrenn ain't giving\nus all the notice we can expect.  He said he mightn't be going\nfor a long time.\"\n",
                "\"Oh!\" grunted Mrs. Zapp.  \"So mah own flesh and blood is going\nto turn against me!\"\n",
                "She rose.  Her appearance of majesty was somewhat lessened by\nthe creak of stays, but her instinct for unpleasantness was\nalways good.  She said nothing as she left them, and she plodded\nup-stairs with a train of sighs.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn looked as though sudden illness had overpowered him.\nBut Theresa laughed, and remarked:  \"You don't want to let Ma\nget on her high horse, Mr. Wrenn.  She's a bluff.\"\n",
                "With much billowing of the lower, less stiff part of her\ngarments, she sailed to the cloudy mirror over the\nmagazine-filled bookcase and inspected her cap of false curls,\nwith many prods of her large firm hands which flashed with\nBrazilian diamonds.  Though he had heard the word \"puffs,\"\nhe did not know that half her hair was false.  He stared\nat it.  Though in disgrace, he felt the honor of knowing\nso ample and rustling a woman as Miss Lee Theresa.\n",
                "\"But, say, I wish I could 've let her know I was going earlier,\nMiss Zapp.  I didn't know it myself, but it does seem like a\nmean trick.  I s'pose I ought to pay her something extra.\"\n",
                "\"Why, child, you won't do anything of the sort.  Ma hasn't got\na bit of kick coming.  You've always been awful nice, far as I\ncan see.\"  She smiled lavishly.  \"I went for a walk to-night....\nI wish all those men wouldn't stare at a girl so.  I'm sure I\ndon't see why they should stare at me.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn nodded, but that didn't seem to be the right comment,\nso he shook his head, then looked frightfully embarrassed.\n",
                "\"I went by that Armenian restaurant you were telling me about,\nMr. Wrenn.  Some time I believe I'll go dine there.\"  Again she paused.\n",
                "He said only, \"Yes, it is a nice place.\"\n",
                "Remarking to herself that there was no question about it,\nafter all, he _was_ a little fool, Theresa continued the siege.\n\"Do you dine there often?\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes.  It is a nice place.\"\n",
                "\"Could a lady go there?\"\n",
                "\"Why, yes, I--\"\n",
                "\"Yes!\"\n",
                "\"I should think so,\" he finished.\n",
                "\"Oh!...  I do get so awfully tired of the greasy stuff Ma and\nGoaty dish up.  They think a big stew that tastes like\ndish-water is a dinner, and if they do have anything I like they\nkeep on having the same thing every day till I throw it in the\nsink.  I wish I could go to a restaurant once in a while for a\nchange, but of course--I dunno's it would be proper for a\nlady to go alone even there.  What do you think?  Oh dear!\"\nShe sat brooding sadly.\n",
                "He had an inspiration.  Perhaps Miss Theresa could be persuaded\nto go out to dinner with him some time.  He begged:\n",
                "\"Gee, I wish you'd let me take you up there some evening, Miss Zapp.\"\n",
                "\"Now, didn't I tell you to call me `Miss Theresa'?  Well, I\nsuppose you just don't want to be friends with me.  Nobody\ndoes.\"  She brooded again.\n",
                "\"Oh, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  Honest I didn't.\nI've always thought you'd think I was fresh if I called you\n`Miss Theresa,' and so I--\"\n",
                "\"Why, I guess I could go up to the Armenian with you, perhaps.\nWhen would you like to go?  You know I've always got lots of\ndates but I--um--let's see, I think I could go to-morrow evening.\"\n",
                "\"Let's do it!  Shall I call for you, Miss--uh--Theresa?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, you may if you'll be a good boy.  Good night.\" She\ndeparted with an air of intimacy.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn scuttled to the Nickelorion, and admitted to the\nBrass-button Man that he was \"feeling pretty good 's evening.\"\n",
                "He had never supposed that a handsome creature like Miss Theresa\ncould ever endure such a \"slow fellow\" as himself.  For about\none minute he considered with a chill the question of whether\nshe was agreeable because of his new wealth, but reproved the\nfiend who was making the suggestion; for had he not heard her\nmention with great scorn a second cousin who had married an old\nYankee for his money?  That just settled _that_, he assured\nhimself, and scowled at a passing messenger-boy for having thus\nhinted, but hastily grimaced as the youngster showed signs of\nloud displeasure.\n",
                "The Armenian restaurant is peculiar, for it has foreign food at\nlow prices, and is below Thirtieth Street, yet it has not become\nBohemian.  Consequently it has no bad music and no crowd of\npersons from Missouri whose women risk salvation for an evening\nby smoking cigarettes.  Here prosperous Oriental merchants,\nof mild natures and bandit faces, drink semi-liquid Turkish\ncoffee and discuss rugs and revolutions.\n",
                "In fact, the place seemed so unartificial that Theresa, facing\nMr. Wrenn, was bored.  And the menu was foreign without being\nSociety viands.  It suggested rats' tails and birds' nests, she\nwas quite sure.  She would gladly have experimented with _pate\nde foie gras_ or alligator-pears, but what social prestige was\nthere to be gained at the factory by remarking that she \"always\ndid like _pahklava_\"?  Mr. Wrenn did not see that she was\nglancing about discontentedly, for he was delightedly listening\nto a lanky young man at the next table who was remarking to his\n_vis-a-vis_, a pale slithey lady in black, with the lines of a\ntorpedo-boat:  \"Try some of the stuffed vine-leaves, child of\nthe angels, and some wheat _pilaf_ and some _bourma_.  Your wheat\n_pilaf_ is a comfortable food and cheering to the stomach of man.\nSimply _won_-derful.  As for the _bourma_, he is a merry beast, a\nbrown rose of pastry with honey cunningly secreted between his\npetals and--Here!  Waiter! Stuffed vine-leaves, wheat _p'laf,\nbourm'_--twice on the order and hustle it.\"\n",
                "\"When you get through listening to that man--he talks like a bar\nof soap--tell me what there is on this bill of fare that's safe\nto eat,\" snorted Theresa.\n",
                "\"I thought he was real funny,\" insisted Mr. Wrenn....  \"I'm sure\nyou'll like _shish kebab_ and s--\"\n",
                "\"_Shish kibub!_  Who ever heard of such a thing!  Haven't they\nany--oh, I thought they'd have stuff they call `Turkish Delight'\nand things like that.\"\n",

Papa Gouroff was\na Russian Jew who had been a police spy in Poland and a hotel\nproprietor in Mogador, where he called himself Turkish and\nmarried a renegade Armenian.  He had a nose like a sickle and a\nneck like a blue-gum nigger.  He hoped that the place would\ndegenerate into a Bohemian restaurant where liberal clergymen\nwould think they were slumming, and barbers would think they\nwere entering society, so he always wore a _fez_ and talked bad\nArabic.  He was local color, atmosphere, Bohemian flavor.  Mr.\nWrenn murmured to Theresa:\n",

Mr. Wrenn was\ndisturbed by the fact that the swindler heroes robbed quite all\nthe others, but he was stirred by the brisk romance of\nmoney-making.  The swindlers were supermen--blonde beasts with\ncard indices and options instead of clubs.  Not that Mr. Wrenn\nmade any observations regarding supermen.  But when, by way of\ncommercial genius, the swindler robbed a young night clerk Mr.\nWrenn whispered to Theresa, \"Gee! he certainly does know how to\njolly them, heh?\"\n",

He may even\nhave strutted a little as he hailed a car with an imaginary\nwalking-stick.  His parting with Miss Theresa was intimate; he\nshook her hand warmly.\n",
                "As he undressed he hoped that he had not been too abrupt with\nthe waiter, \"poor cuss.\"  But he lay awake to think of Theresa's\nhair and hand-clasp; of polished desks and florid gentlemen who\ncurtly summoned bank-presidents and who had--he tossed the\nbedclothes about in his struggle to get the word--who had a\n_punch!_\n",

That Our Mr. Wrenn should dream for\ndreaming's sake was catastrophic; he might do things because\nhe wanted to, not because they were fashionable; whereupon,\npolice forces and the clergy would disband, Wall Street and\nFifth Avenue would go thundering down.  Hence, for him were\nprovided those Y. M. C. A. night bookkeeping classes\nadministered by solemn earnest men of thirty for solemn credulous\nyouths of twenty-nine; those sermons on content; articles on\n\"building up the rundown store by live advertising\"; Kiplingesque\nstories about playing the game; and correspondence-school\nadvertisements that shrieked, \"Mount the ladder to thorough\nknowledge--the path to power and to the fuller pay-envelope.\"\n",
                "To all these Mr. Wrenn had been indifferent, for they showed no\nimagination.  But when he saw Big Business glorified by a\nhumorous melodrama, then The Job appeared to him as picaresque\nadventure, and he was in peril of his imagination.\n",
                "The eight-o'clock sun, which usually found a wildly shaving Mr.\nWrenn, discovered him dreaming that he was the manager of the\nSouvenir Company.  But that was a complete misunderstanding of\nthe case.  The manager of the Souvenir Company was Mr. Mortimer\nR. Guilfogle, and he called Mr. Wrenn in to acquaint him with\nthat fact when the new magnate started his career in Big\nBusiness by arriving at the office one hour late.\n",
                "What made it worse, considered Mr. Guilfogle, was that this\nWrenn had a higher average of punctuality than any one else in\nthe office, which proved that he knew better.  Worst of all, the\nGuilfogle family eggs had not been scrambled right at breakfast;\nthey had been anemic.  Mr. Guilfogle punched the buzzer and set\nhis face toward the door, with a scowl prepared.\n",

                "Whether he or Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle was the more aghast at\nhearing him bawl this no one knows.  The manager was so worried\nat the thought of breaking in a new man that his eye-glasses\nslipped off his poor perspiring nose.  He begged, in sudden\ntones of old friendship:\n",
                "\"Why, you can't be thinking of leaving us!  Why, we expect to\nmake a big man of you, Wrenn.  I was joking about firing you.\nYou ought to know that, after the talk we had at Mouquin's the\nother night.  You can't be thinking of leaving us!  There's no\nend of possibilities here.\"\n",

                "He skipped up-town, looking at the stars.  He shouted as he saw\nthe stacks of a big Cunarder bulking up at the end of Fourteenth\nStreet.  He stopped to chuckle over a lithograph of the\nParthenon at the window of a Greek bootblack's stand.\nStars--steamer--temples, all these were his.  He owned them now.\nHe was free.\n",

Then she went to bed, and, though he knew it not, that\nprince of wealthy suitors, Mr. Wrenn, had entirely lost the\nheart and hand of Miss Zapp of the F. F. V.\n",

He studied Mr. Wrenn, smiled,\nput on the look he used when inviting him out for a drink.  Mr.\nGuilfogle was essentially an honest fellow, harshened by The\nJob; a well-satisfied victim, with the imagination clean gone out\nof him, so that he took follow-up letters and the celerity of\noffice-boys as the only serious things in the world.  He was\nstrong, alive, not at all a bad chap, merely efficient.\n",
                "\"Well, Wrenn, I suppose there's no use of rubbing it in.  Course\nyou know what I think about the whole thing.  It strikes me\nyou're a fool to leave a good job.  But, after all, that's your\nbusiness, not ours.  We like you, and when you get tired of\nbeing just a bum, why, come back; we'll always try to have a job\nopen for you.

I'd like to go traveling myself--I\nsuppose you fellows think I wouldn't care to go bumming around\nlike you do and never have to worry about how the firm's going\nto break even.

                "He'd been there a long time.  Now he could never come back to\nit, no matter how much he wanted to....  How good the manager\nhad been to him.  Gee! he hadn't appreciated how considerut\nGuilfogle was!\n",

                "Just then he met them in the corridor, all of them except\nGuilfogle, headed by Rabin, the traveling salesman, and Charley\nCarpenter, who was bearing a box of handkerchiefs with a large\ngreen-and-crimson-paper label.\n",

                "Afterward, by his desk, alone, holding the box of handkerchiefs\nwith the resplendent red-and-green label, Mr. Wrenn began to cry.\n",
                "He was lying abed at eight-thirty on a morning of late June, two\nweeks after leaving the Souvenir Company, deliberately hunting\nover his pillow for cool spots, very hot and restless in the\nlegs and enormously depressed in the soul.  He would have got up\nhad there been anything to get up for.  There was nothing, yet\nhe felt uneasily guilty.  For two weeks he had been afraid of\nlosing, by neglect, the job he had already voluntarily given up.\nSo there are men whom the fear of death has driven to suicide.\n",
                "Nearly every morning he had driven himself from bed and had\nfinished shaving before he was quite satisfied that he didn't\nhave to get to the office on time.  As he wandered about during\nthe day he remarked with frequency, \"I'm scared as teacher's pet\nplaying hookey for the first time, like what we used to do\nin Parthenon.\" All proper persons were at work of a week-day\nafternoon.  What, then, was he doing walking along the street\nwhen all morality demanded his sitting at a desk at the Souvenir\nCompany, being a little more careful, to win the divine favor of\nMortimer R. Guilfogle?\n",
                "He was sure that if he were already out on the Great Traveling\nhe would be able to \"push the buzzer on himself and get up his\nnerve.\" But he did not know where to go.  He had planned so many\ntrips these years that now he couldn't keep any one of them\nfinally decided on for more than an hour.  It rather stretched\nhis short arms to embrace at once a gay old dream of seeing\nVenice and the stern civic duty of hunting abominably dangerous\nbeasts in the Guatemala bush.\n",
                "The expense bothered him, too.  He had through many years so\npersistently saved money for the Great Traveling that he\nbegrudged money for that Traveling itself.  Indeed, he planned\nto spend not more than $300 of the $1,235.80 he had now\naccumulated, on his first venture, during which he hoped to\nlearn the trade of wandering.\n",
                "He was always influenced by a sentence he had read somewhere\nabout \"one of those globe-trotters you meet carrying a\nmonkey-wrench in Calcutta, then in raiment and a monocle at the\nAthenaeum.\"  He would learn some Kiplingy trade that would teach\nhim the use of astonishingly technical tools, also daring and\nthe location of smugglers' haunts, copra islands, and\nwhaling-stations with curious names.\n",
                "He pictured himself shipping as third engineer at the Manihiki\nIslands or engaged for taking moving pictures of an aeroplane\nflight in Algiers.  He _had_ to get away from Zappism.  He had to\nbe out on the iron seas, where the battle-ships and liners went\nby like a marching military band.  But he couldn't get started.\n",
                "Once beyond Sandy Hook, he would immediately know all about\nengines and fighting.  It would help, he was certain, to be\nshanghaied.  But no matter how wistfully, no matter how late at\nnight he timorously forced himself to loiter among unwashed\nEnglish stokers on West Street, he couldn't get himself molested\nexcept by glib persons wishing ten cents \"for a place to sleep.\"\n",
                "When he had dallied through breakfast that particular morning he\nsat about.  Once he had pictured sitting about reading\ntravel-books as a perfect occupation.  But it concealed no\nexciting little surprises when he could be a Sunday loafer on any\nplain Monday.  Furthermore, Goaty never made his bed till noon,\nand the gray-and-brown-patched coverlet seemed to trail all\nabout the disordered room.\n",
                "Midway in a paragraph he rose, threw _One Hundred Ways to See\nCalifornia_ on the tumbled bed, and ran away from Our Mr. Wrenn.\nBut Our Mr. Wrenn pursued him along the wharves, where the sun\nglared on oily water.  He had seen the wharves twelve times that\nfortnight.  In fact, he even cried viciously that \"he had seen\ntoo blame much of the blame wharves.\"\n",
                "Early in the afternoon he went to a moving-picture show, but the\nfirst sight of the white giant figures bulking against the gray\nbackground was wearily unreal; and when the inevitable\nlarge-eyed black-braided Indian maiden met the canonical\ncow-puncher he threshed about in his seat, was irritated by the\nnervous click of the machine and the hot stuffiness of the room,\nand ran away just at the exciting moment when the Indian chief\ndashed into camp and summoned his braves to the war-path.\n",
                "Perhaps he could hide from thought at home.\n",
                "As he came into his room he stood at gaze like a kitten of good\nfamily beholding a mangy mongrel asleep in its pink basket.\nFor on his bed was Mrs. Zapp, her rotund curves stretching behind\nher large flat feet, whose soles were toward him.  She was\nnoisily somnolent; her stays creaked regularly as she breathed,\nexcept when she moved slightly and groaned.\n",
                "Guiltily he tiptoed down-stairs and went snuffling along the\ndusty unvaried brick side streets, wondering where in all New\nYork he could go.  He read minutely a placard advertising an\nexcursion to the Catskills, to start that evening.  For an\nexhilarated moment he resolved to go, but--\" oh, there was a lot\nof them rich society folks up there.\"  He bought a morning\n_American_ and, sitting in Union Square, gravely studied the\nhumorous drawings.\n",
                "He casually noticed the \"Help Wanted\" advertisements.\n",
                "They suggested an uninteresting idea that somehow he might find\nit economical to go venturing as a waiter or farm-hand.\n",

The row of waiting servant-girls curtsied as though\nthey were a hedge swayed by the wind, while Mr. Wrenn\nself-consciously hurried to get past them.\n",
                "He was too excited to worry over the patient and quiet suffering\nwith which Mrs. Zapp heard the announcement that he was going.\nThat Theresa laughed at him for a cattleman, while Goaty, in the\nkitchen, audibly observed that \"nobody but a Yankee would travel\nin a pig-pen, \"merely increased his joy in moving his belongings\nto a storage warehouse.\n",
                "Tuesday morning, clad in a sweater-jacket, tennis-shoes, an old\nfelt hat, a khaki shirt and corduroys, carrying a suit-case\npacked to bursting with clothes and Baedekers, with one hundred\nand fifty dollars in express-company drafts craftily concealed,\nhe dashed down to Baraieff's hole.  Though it was only\neight-thirty, he was afraid he was going to be late.\n",
                "Till 2 P.M.  he sat waiting, then was sent to the Joy Steamship\nLine wharf with a ticket to Boston and a letter to Trubiggs's\nshipping-office:  \"Give bearer Ren as per inclosed receet one\ntrip England catel boat charge my acct.  SYLVESTRE BARAIEFF, N. Y.\"\n",
                "Standing on the hurricane-deck of the Joy Line boat, with his\nsuit-case guardedly beside him, he crooned to himself tuneless\nchants with the refrain, \"Free, free, out to sea.  Free, free,\nthat's _me!_\" He had persuaded himself that there was practically\nno danger of the boat's sinking or catching fire.  Anyway, he\njust wasn't going to be scared.  As the steamer trudged up East\nRiver he watched the late afternoon sun brighten the Manhattan\nfactories and make soft the stretches of Westchester fields.\n(Of course, he \"thrilled.\")\n",
                "He had no state-room, but was entitled to a place in a\ntwelve-berth room in the hold.  Here large farmers without their\nshoes were grumpily talking all at once, so he returned to the\ndeck; and the rest of the night, while the other passengers\nsnored, he sat modestly on a canvas stool, unblinkingly gloating\nover a sea-fabric of frosty blue that was shot through with\ngolden threads when they passed lighthouses or ships.  At dawn\nhe was weary, peppery-eyed, but he viewed the flooding light\nwith approval.\n",
                "At last, Boston.\n",
                "The front part of the shipping-office on Atlantic Avenue was a\nglass-inclosed room littered with chairs, piles of circulars,\nold pictures of Cunarders, older calendars, and directories to\nbe ranked as antiques.  In the midst of these remains a\nred-headed Yankee of forty, smoking a Pittsburg stogie, sat\ntilted back in a kitchen chair, reading the Boston _American_.\nMr. Wrenn delivered M. Baraieff's letter and stood waiting,\nholding his suit-case, ready to skip out and go aboard a\ncattle-boat immediately.\n",
                "The shipping-agent glanced through the letter, then snapped:\n",
                "\"Bryff's crazy.  Always sends 'em too early.  Wrenn, you ought\nto come to me first.  What j'yuh go to that Jew first for?  Here\nhe goes and sends you a day late--or couple days too early.  'F\nyou'd got here last night I could 've sent you off this morning\non a Dominion Line boat.  All I got now is a Leyland boat that\nstarts from Portland Saturday.  Le's see; this is Wednesday.\nThursday, Friday--you'll have to wait three days.  Now you want\nme to fix you up, don't you?  I might not be able to get you off\ntill a week from now, but you'd like to get off on a good boat\nSaturday instead, wouldn't you?\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes; I _would_.  I--\"\n",
                "\"Well, I'll try to fix it.  You can see for yourself; boats\nain't leaving every minute just to please Bryff.  And it's the\nbusy season.  Bunches of rah-rah boys wanting to cross, and\nCanadians wanting to get back to England, and Jews beating it to\nPoland--to sling bombs at the Czar, I guess.  And lemme tell\nyou, them Jews is all right.  They're willing to pay for a man's\ntime and trouble in getting 'em fixed up, and so--\"\n",
                "With dignity Mr. William Wrenn stated,  \"Of course I'll be glad\nto--uh--make it worth your while.\"\n",
                "\"I _thought_ you was a gentleman.  Hey, Al! _Al!_\"  An underfed boy\nwith few teeth, dusty and grown out of his trousers, appeared.\n\"Clear off a chair for the gentleman.  Stick that valise on top\nmy desk....  Sit down, Mr. Wrenn.  You see, it's like this:  I'll\ntell you in confidence, you understand.  This letter from Bryff\nain't worth the paper it's written on.  He ain't got any right\nto be sending out men for cattle-boats.  Me, I'm running that.\nI deal direct with all the Boston and Portland lines.  If you\ndon't believe it just go out in the back room and ask any of the\ncattlemen out there.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I see,\" Mr. Wrenn observed, as though he were ill, and\ntoed an old almanac about the floor.  \"Uh--Mr.--Trubiggs, is it?\"\n",
                "\"Yump.  Yump, my boy.  Trubiggs.  Tru by name and true by\nnature.  Heh?\"\n",
                "This last was said quite without conviction.  It was evidently\na joke which had come down from earlier years.  Mr. Wrenn\nignored it and declared, as stoutly as he could:\n",
                "\"You see, Mr. Trubiggs, I'd be willing to pay you--\"\n",
                "\"I'll tell you just how it is, Mr. Wrenn.  I ain't one of these\nSheeny employment bureaus; I'm an American; I like to look out\nfor Americans.  Even if you _didn't_ come to me first I'll watch\nout for your interests, same's if they was mine.  Now, do you\nwant to get fixed up with a nice fast boat that leaves Portland\nnext Saturday, just a couple of days' wait?\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes, I _do_, Mr. Trubiggs.\"\n",
                "\"Well, my list is really full--men waiting, too--but if it 'd be\nworth five dollars to you to--\"\n",
                "\"Here's the five dollars.\"\n",
                "The shipping-agent was disgusted.  He had estimated from Mr.\nWrenn's cheap sweater-jacket and tennis-shoes that he would be\nable to squeeze out only three or four dollars, and here he\nmight have made ten.  More in sorrow than in anger:\n",
                "\"Of course you understand I may have a lot of trouble working\nyou in on the _next_ boat, you coming as late as this.  Course\nfive dollars is less 'n what I usually get.\" He contemptuously\ntossed the bill on his desk.  \"If you want me to slip a little\nsomething extra to the agents--\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn was too head-achy to be customarily timid.  \"Let's see\nthat.  Did I give you only five dollars?\"  Receiving the bill, he\nfolded it with much primness, tucked it into the pocket of his\nshirt, and remarked:\n",
                "\"Now, you said you'd fix me up for five dollars.  Besides, that\nletter from Baraieff is a form with your name printed on it; so\nI know you do business with him right along.  If five dollars\nain't enough, why, then you can just go to hell, Mr. Trubiggs;\nyes, sir, that's what you can do.  I'm just getting tired of\nmonkeying around.  If five _is_ enough I'll give this back to you\nFriday, when you send me off to Portland, if you give me a\nreceipt.  There!\"  He almost snarled, so weary and discouraged\nwas he.\n",
                "Now, Trubiggs was a warm-hearted rogue, and he liked the society\nof what he called \"white people.\"  He laughed, poked a Pittsburg\nstogie at Mr. Wrenn, and consented:\n",
                "\"All right.  I'll fix you up.  Have a smoke.  Pay me the five\nFriday, or pay it to my foreman when he puts you on the\ncattle-boat.  I don't care a rap which.  You're all right.\nCan't bluff you, eh?\"\n",
                "And, further bluffing Mr. Wrenn, he suggested to him a\nlodging-house for his two nights in Boston.  \"Tell the clerk\nthat red-headed Trubiggs sent you, and he'll give you the best\nin the house.  Tell him you're a friend of mine.\"\n",
                "When Mr. Wrenn had gone Mr. Trubiggs remarked to some one, by\ntelephone, \"'Nother sucker coming, Blaugeld.  Now don't try to\ndo me out of my bit or I'll cap for some other joint,\nunderstand?  Huh?  Yuh, stick him for a thirty-five-cent bed.\nS' long.\"\n",
                "The caravan of Trubiggs's cattlemen who left for Portland by\nnight steamer, Friday, was headed by a bulky-shouldered boss, who\nwore no coat and whose corduroy vest swung cheerfully open.  A\nmotley troupe were the cattlemen--Jews with small trunks,\nlarge imitation-leather valises and assorted bundles, a stolid\nprophet-bearded procession of weary men in tattered derbies and\nsweat-shop clothes.\n",
                "There were Englishmen with rope-bound pine chests.  A\nlewd-mouthed American named Tim, who said he was a hatter out of\nwork, and a loud-talking tough called Pete mingled with a\nstraggle of hoboes.\n",
                "The boss counted the group and selected his confidants for the\ntrip to Portland--Mr. Wrenn and a youth named Morton.\n",
                "Morton was a square heavy-fleshed young man with stubby hands,\nwho, up to his eyes, was stolid and solid as a granite monument,\nbut merry of eye and hinting friendliness in his tousled\nsoft-brown hair.  He was always wielding a pipe and artfully\nblowing smoke through his nostrils.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn and he smiled at each other searchingly as the\nPortland boat pulled out, and a wind swept straight from the\nLand of Elsewhere.\n",
                "After dinner Morton, smoking a pipe shaped somewhat like a\ngolf-stick head and somewhat like a toad, at the rail of the\nsteamer, turned to Mr. Wrenn with:\n",
                "\"Classy bunch of cattlemen we've got to go with.  Not!...  My\nname's Morton.\"\n",
                "\"I'm awful glad to meet you, Mr. Morton.  My name's Wrenn.\"\n",
                "\"Glad to be off at last, ain't you?\"\n",
                "\"Golly! I should say I _am!_\"\n",
                "\"So'm I.  Been waiting for this for years.  I'm a clerk for the\nP. R. R. in N' York.\"\n",
                "\"I come from New York, too.\"\n",
                "\"So?  Lived there long?\"\n",
                "\"Uh-huh, I--\" began Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "\"Well, I been working for the Penn. for seven years now.  Now\nI've got a vacation of three months.  On me.  Gives me a chance\nto travel a little.  Got ten plunks and a second-class ticket\nback from Glasgow.  But I'm going to see England and France just\nthe same.  Prob'ly Germany, too.\"\n",
                "\"Second class?  Why don't you go steerage, and save?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, got to come back like a gentleman.  You know.  You're from\nNew York, too, eh?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I'm with an art-novelty company on Twenty-eighth Street.\nI been wanting to get away for quite some time, too....  How are\nyou going to travel on ten dollars?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, work m' way.  Cinch.  Always land on my feet.  Not on my\nuppers, at that.  I'm only twenty-eight, but I've been on my\nown, like the English fellow says, since I was twelve....  Well,\nhow about you?  Traveling or going somewhere?\"\n",
                "\"Just traveling.  I'm glad we're going together, Mr. Morton.\nI don't think most of these cattlemen are very nice.  Except for\nthe old Jews.  They seem to be fine old coots.  They make you\nthink of--oh--you know--prophets and stuff.  Watch 'em, over\nthere, making tea.  I suppose the steamer grub ain't kosher.\nI seen one on the Joy Line saying his prayers--I suppose he\nwas--in a kind of shawl.\"\n",
                "\"Well, well! You don't say so!\"\n",
                "Distinctly, Mr. Wrenn felt that he was one of the gentlemen who,\nin Kipling, stand at steamer rails exchanging observations on\nstrange lands.  He uttered, cosmopolitanly:\n",
                "\"Gee! Look at that sunset.  Ain't that grand!\"\n",
                "\"Holy smoke! it sure is.  I don't see how anybody could believe\nin religion after looking at that.\"\n",
                "Shocked and confused at such a theory, yet excited at finding\nthat Morton apparently had thoughts, Mr. Wrenn piped:\n\"Honestly, I don't see that at _all_.  I don't see how anybody\ncould disbelieve anything after a sunset like that.  Makes me\nbelieve all sorts of thing--gets me going--I imagine I'm all\nsorts of places--on the Nile and so on.\"\n",
                "\"Sure! That's just it.  Everything's so peaceful and natural.\nJust _is_.  Gives the imagination enough to do, even by itself,\nwithout having to have religion.\"\n",
                "\"Well,\" reflected Mr. Wrenn, \"I don't hardly ever go to church.\nI don't believe much in all them highbrow sermons that don't\ncome down to brass tacks--ain't got nothing to do with real\nfolks.  But just the same, I love to go up to St. Patrick's\nCathedral.  Why, I get real _thrilled_--I hope you won't think\nI'm trying to get high-browed, Mr. Morton.\"\n",
                "\"Why, no.  Cer'nly not.  I understand.  Gwan.\"\n",
                "\"It gets me going when I look down the aisle at the altar and\nsee the arches and so on.  And the priests in their robes--they\nlook so--so way up--oh, I dunno just how to say it--so kind of\n_uplifted_.\"\n",
                "\"Sure, I know.  Just the esthetic end of the game.  Esthetic,\nyou know--the beauty part of it.\"\n",
                "\"Yuh, sure, that's the word.  'Sthetic, that's what it is.\nYes, 'sthetic.  But, just the same, it makes me feel's though I\nbelieved in all sorts of things.\"\n",
                "\"Tell you what I believe may happen, though,\" exulted Morton.\n\"This socialism, and maybe even these here International Workers\nof the World, may pan out as a new kind of religion.  I don't\nknow much about it, I got to admit.  But looks as though it might\nbe that way.  It's dead certain the old political parties are just\ngangs--don't stand for anything except the name.  But this comrade\nbusiness--good stunt.  Brotherhood of man--real brotherhood.  My\nidea of religion.  One that is because it's got to be, not just\nbecause it always has been.  Yessir, me for a religion of guys\nworking together to make things easier for each other.\"\n",
                "\"You bet!\" commented Mr. Wrenn, and they smote each other upon\nthe shoulder and laughed together in a fine flame of shared hope.\n",
                "\"I wish I knew something about this socialism stuff,\" mused Mr.\nWrenn, with tilted head, examining the burnt-umber edges of the\nsunset.\n",
                "\"Great stuff.  Not working for some lazy cuss that's inherited\nthe right to boss you.  And _international_ brotherhood, not just\nneighborhoods.  New thing.\"\n",
                "\"Gee! I surely would like that, awfully,\" sighed Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "He saw the processional of world brotherhood tramp steadily\nthrough the paling sunset; saffron-vestured Mandarin marching by\nflax-faced Norseman and languid South Sea Islander--the diverse\npeoples toward whom he had always yearned.\n",
                "\"But I don't care so much for some of these ranting street-corner\nsocialists, though,\" mused Morton.  \"The kind that holler `Come\nget saved _our_ way or go to hell!  Keep off scab guides to prosperity.'\"\n",
                "\"Yuh, sure.  Ha! ha! ha!\"\n",
                "\"Huh! huh!\"\n",
                "Morton soon had another thought.  \"Still, same time, us guys\nthat do the work have got to work out something for ourselves.\nWe can't bank on the rah-rah boys that wear eye-glasses and\ncondescend to like us, cause they think we ain't entirely too\ndirty for 'em to associate with, and all these writer guys and\nso on.  That's where you got to hand it to the street-corner\nshouters.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, that's _so_.  Y' right there, I guess, all right.\"\n",
                "They looked at each other and laughed again; initiated friends;\ntasting each other's souls.  They shared sandwiches and\nconfessions.  When the other passengers had gone to bed and the\nsailors on watch seemed lonely the two men were still declaring,\nshyly but delightedly, that \"things is curious.\"\n",
                "In the damp discomfort of early morning the cattlemen shuffled\nfrom the steamer at Portland and were herded to a lunch-room by\nthe boss, who cheerfully smoked his corn-cob and ejaculated to\nMr. Wrenn and Morton such interesting facts as:\n",
                "\"Trubiggs is a lobster.  You don't want to let the bosses bluff\nyou aboard the _Merian_.  They'll try to chase you in where the\nsteers'll gore you.  The grub'll be--\"\n",
                "\"What grub do you get?\"\n",
                "\"Scouse and bread.  And water.\"\n",
                "\"What's scouse?\"\n",
                "\"Beef stew without the beef.  Oh, the grub'll be rotten.\nTrubiggs is a lobster.  He wouldn't be nowhere if 't wa'n't for me.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn appreciated England's need of roast beef, but he\ntimidly desired not to be gored by steers, which seemed\nimminent, before breakfast coffee.  The streets were coldly\nempty, and he was sleepy, and Morton was silent.  At the\nrestaurant, sitting on a high stool before a pine counter, he\nchoked over an egg sandwich made with thick crumby slices of a\nbread that had no personality to it.  He roved forlornly about\nPortland, beside the gloomy pipe-valiant Morton, fighting two\nfears: the company might not need all of them this trip, and he\nmight have to wait; secondly, if he incredibly did get shipped\nand started for England the steers might prove dreadfully\ndangerous.  After intense thinking he ejaculated, \"Gee! it's be\nbored or get gored.\" Which was much too good not to tell Morton,\nso they laughed very much, and at ten o'clock were signed on for\nthe trip and led, whooping, to the deck of the S.S. _Merian_.\n",
                "Cattle were still struggling down the chutes from the dock.  The\ndirty decks were confusingly littered with cordage and the\ncattlemen's luggage.  The Jewish elders stared sepulchrally at\nthe wilderness of open hatches and rude passageways, as though\nthey were prophesying death.\n",
                "But Mr. Wrenn, standing sturdily beside his suit-case to guard\nit, fawned with romantic love upon the rusty iron sides of their\npilgrims' caravel; and as the _Merian_ left the wharf with no\nmore handkerchief-waving or tears than attends a ferry's leaving\nhe mumbled:\n",

                "Though it was so late as eight bells of the evening, Pete, the\ntough factory hand, and Tim, the down-and-out hatter, were still\nplaying seven-up at the dirty fo'c'sle table, while McGarver,\nunder-boss of the Morris cattle gang, lay in his berth, heavily\nstudying the game and blowing sulphurous fumes of Lunch Pail\nPlug Cut tobacco up toward Wrennie.\n",

Tim, the hatter, was a loud-talking weakling, under\nPete's domination.  Tim wore a dirty rubber collar without a\ntie, and his soul was like his neckware.\n",
                "McGarver, the under-boss, was a good shepherd among the men,\nthough he had recently lost the head foremanship by a spree\ncomplicated with language and violence.  He looked like one of\nthe _Merian_ bulls, with broad short neck and short curly hair\nabove a thick-skinned deeply wrinkled low forehead.  He never\nundressed, but was always seen, as now, in heavy shoes and\nblue-gray woolen socks tucked over the bottoms of his overalls.\nHe was gruff and kind and tyrannical and honest.\n",
                "Wrennie shook and drew his breath sharply as the foghorn yawped\nout its \"Whawn-n-n-n\" again, reminding him that they were\nstill in the Bank fog; that at any moment they were likely to be\nstunned by a heart-stopping crash as some liner's bow burst\nthrough the fo'c'sle's walls in a collision.  Bow-plates\nbuckling in and shredding, the in-thrust of an enormous black\nbow, water flooding in, cries and--However, the horn did at least\nshow that They were awake up there on the bridge to steer him\nthrough the fog; and weren't They experienced seamen?

And the card-players assured him that his suit-case,\nwhich he had intrusted to the Croac ship's carpenter, would\nprobably be stolen by \"Satan.\"\n",

He dilated upon Satan's wrath at\nWrennie for not \"coming across\" with ten dollars for a bribe\nas he, Pete, had done.\n",

                "McGarver, the straw-boss, would always lie awake to enjoy a good\nbrisk indecent story, but he liked Wrennie's admiration of him,\nso, lunging with his bull-like head out of his berth, he snorted:\n",
                "\"Hey, you, Pete, it's time to pound your ear.  Cut it out.\"\n",
                "Wrennie called down, sternly, \"I ain't no theological student,\nPete, and I don't mind profanity, but I wish you wouldn't talk\nlike a garbage-scow.\"\n",
                "\"Hey, Poicy, did yuh bring your dictionary?\"  Pete bellowed to\nTim, two feet distant from him.  To Wrennie, \"Say, Gladys, ain't\nyou afraid one of them long woids like, t'eological, will turn\naround and bite you right on the wrist?\"\n",
                "\"Dry up!\" irritatedly snapped a Canadian.\n",
                "\"Aw, cut it out, you--,\" groaned another.\n",
                "\"Shut up,\" added McGarver, the straw-boss.  \"Both of you.\"\nRaging:  \"Gwan to bed, Pete, or I'll beat your block clean off.\nI mean it, see?  _Hear me?_\"\n",
                "Yes, Pete heard him.  Doubtless the first officer on the bridge\nheard, too, and perhaps the inhabitants of Newfoundland.  But\nPete took his time in scratching the back of his neck and\nstretching before he crawled into his berth.  For half an hour\nhe talked softly to Tim, for Wrennie's benefit, stating his belief\nthat Satan, the head boss, had once thrown overboard a Jew much\nlike Wrennie, and was likely thus to serve Wrennie, too.\nTim pictured the result when, after the capsizing of the steamer\nwhich would undoubtedly occur if this long sickening motion kept up,\nWrennie had to take to a boat with Satan.\n",
                "The fingers of Wrennie curled into shape for strangling some one.\n",
                "When Pete was asleep he worried off into thin slumber.\n",
                "Then, there was Satan, the head boss, jerking him out of his\nberth, stirring his cramped joints to another dawn of\ndrudgery--two hours of work and two of waiting before the daily\neight-o'clock insult called breakfast.  He tugged on his shoes,\nmarveling at Mr. Wrenn's really being there, at his sitting in\ncramped stoop on the side of a berth in a dark filthy place that\nwent up and down like a freight elevator, subject to the orders\nof persons whom he did not in the least like.\n",
                "Through the damp gray sea-air he staggered hungrily along the\ngangway to the hatch amidships, and trembled down the iron\nladder to McGarver's crew 'tween-decks.\n",
                "First, watering the steers.  Sickened by walking backward with\npails of water he carried till he could see and think of nothing\nin the world save the water-butt, the puddle in front of it, and\nthe cattlemen mercilessly dipping out pails there, through\ncenturies that would never end.  How those steers did drink!\n",
                "McGarver's favorite bull, which he called \"the Grenadier,\" took\nten pails and still persisted in leering with dripping gray\nmouth beyond the headboard, trying to reach more.  As Wrennie\nwas carrying a pail to the heifers beyond, the Grenadier's horn\ncaught and tore his overalls.  The boat lurched.  The pail\nwhirled out of his hand.  He grasped an iron stanchion and\nkicked the Grenadier in the jaw till the steer backed off, a\nreformed character.\n",
                "McGarver cheered, for such kicks were a rule of the game.\n",
                "\"Good work,\" ironically remarked Tim, the weakling hatter.\n",
                "\"You go to hell,\" snapped Wrennie, and Tim looked much more\nrespectful.\n",
                "But Wrennie lost this credit before they had finished feeding\nout the hay, for he grew too dizzy to resent Tim's remarks.\n",
                "Straining to pitch forkfuls into the pens while the boat rolled,\nslopping along the wet gangway, down by the bunkers of coal,\nwhere the heat seemed a close-wound choking shroud and the\ndarkness was made only a little pale by light coming through\ndust-caked port-holes, he sneezed and coughed and grunted till\nhe was exhausted.  The floating bits of hay-dust were a thousand\nimpish hands with poisoned nails scratching at the roof of his\nmouth.  His skin prickled all over.  He constantly discovered\nnew and aching muscles.  But he wabbled on until he finished the\nwork, fifteen minutes after Tim had given out.\n",
                "He crawled up to the main deck and huddled in the shelter of a\npile of hay-bales where Pete was declaring to Tim and the rest\nthat Satan \"couldn't never get nothing on him.\"\n",
                "Morton broke into Pete's publicity with the question, \"Say, is\nit straight what they say, Pete, that you're the guy that owns\nthe Leyland Line and that's why you know so much more than the\nrest of us poor lollops?  Watson, the needle, quick!\"  [Applause\nand laughter.]\n",
                "Wrennie felt personally grateful to Morton for this, but he went\nup to the aft top deck, where he could lie alone on a pile of\ntarpaulins.  He made himself observe the sea which, as Kipling\nand Jack London had specifically promised him in their stories,\nsurrounded him, everywhere shining free; but he glanced at it\nonly once.  To the north was a liner bound for home.\n",
                "Home!  Gee!  That _was_ rubbing it in!  While at work, whether\nhe was sick or not, he could forget--things.  But the liner,\nfleeting on with bright ease, made the cattle-boat seem about\nas romantic as Mrs. Zapp's kitchen sink.\n",
                "Why, he wondered--\"why had he been a chump?  Him a wanderer?\nNo; he was a hired man on a sea-going dairy-farm.  Well, he'd get\nonto this confounded job before he was through with it, but\nthen--gee! back to God's Country!\"\n",
                "While the _Merian_, eleven days out, pleasantly rocked through\nthe Irish Sea, with the moon revealing the coast of Anglesey,\none Bill Wrenn lay on the after-deck, condescending to the\nheavens.  It was so warm that they did not need to sleep below,\nand half a dozen of the cattlemen had brought their mattresses\nup on deck.  Beside Bill Wrenn lay the man who had given him\nthat name--Tim, the hatter, who had become weakly alarmed and\nadmiring as Wrennie learned to rise feeling like a boy in early\nvacation-time, and to find shouting exhilaration in sending a\nforkful of hay fifteen good feet.\n",
                "Morton, who lay near by, had also adopted the name \"Bill\nWrenn.\"  Most of the trip Morton had discussed Pete and Tim\ninstead of the fact that \"things is curious.\"  Mr. Wrenn had been\njealous at first, but when he learned from Morton the theory\nthat even a Pete was a \"victim of 'vironment\" he went out for\nknowing him quite systematically.\n",
                "To McGarver he had been \"Bill Wrenn\" since the fifth day, when\nhe had kept a hay-bale from slipping back into the hold on the\nboss's head.  Satan and Pete still called him \"Wrennie,\" but he\nwas not thinking about them just now with Tim listening\nadmiringly to his observations on socialism.\n",
                "Tim fell asleep.  Bill Wrenn lay quiet and let memory color the\nsky above him.  He recalled the gardens of water which had\nflowered in foam for him, strange ships and nomadic gulls, and\nthe schools of sleekly black porpoises that, for him, had\nwhisked through violet waves.  Most of all, he brought back the\nyesterday's long excitement and delight of seeing the Irish\ncoast hills--his first foreign land--whose faint sky fresco had\nseemed magical with the elfin lore of Ireland, a country that\nhad ever been to him the haunt not of potatoes and politicians,\nbut of fays.  He had wanted fays.  They were not common on the\nasphalt of West Sixteenth Street.  But now he had seen them\nbeckoning in Wanderland.\n",
                "He was falling asleep under the dancing dome of the sky, a happy\nMr. Wrenn, when he was aroused as a furious Bill, the cattleman.\nPete was clogging near by, singing hoarsely, \"Dey was a skoit\nand 'er name was Goity.\"\n",
                "\"You shut up!\" commanded Bill Wrenn.\n",
                "\"Say, be careful!\" the awakened Tim implored of him.\nPete snorted:  \"Who says to `shut up,' hey?  Who was it, Satan?\"\n",
                "From the capstan, where he was still smoking, the head foreman\nmuttered:  \"What's the odds?  The little man won't say it again.\"\n",
                "Pete stood by Bill Wrenn's mattress.  \"Who said `shut up'?\"\nsounded ominously.\n",
                "Bill popped out of bed with what he regarded as a vicious\nfighting-crouch.  For he was too sleepy to be afraid.  \"I did!\nWhat you going to do about it?\"  More mildly, as a fear of his\nown courage began to form, \"I want to sleep.\"\n",
                "\"Oh!  You want to sleep.  Little mollycoddle wants to sleep,\ndoes he?  Come here!\"\n",
                "The tough grabbed at Bill's shirt-collar across the mattress.\nBill ducked, stuck out his arm wildly, and struck Pete, half by\naccident.  Roaring, Pete bunted him, and he went down, with Pete\nkneeling on his stomach and pounding him.\n",
                "Morton and honest McGarver, the straw-boss, sprang to drag off\nPete, while Satan, the panther, with the first interest they had\never seen in his eyes, snarled: \"Let 'em fight fair.  Rounds.\nYou're a' right, Bill.\"\n",
                "\"Right,\" commended Morton.\n",
                "Armored with Satan's praise, firm but fearful in his rubber\nsneakers, surprised and shocked to find himself here doing this,\nBill Wrenn squared at the rowdy.  The moon touched sadly the\nlightly sketched Anglesey coast and the rippling wake, but Bill\nWrenn, oblivious of dream moon and headland, faced his\nfellow-bruiser.\n",
                "They circled.  Pete stuck out his foot gently.  Morton sprang\nin, bawling furiously, \"None o' them rough-and-tumble tricks.\"\n",
                "\"Right-o,\" added McGarver.\n",
                "Pete scowled.  He was left powerless.  He puffed and grew dizzy\nas Bill Wrenn danced delicately about him, for he could do\nnothing without back-street tactics.  He did bloody the nose of\nBill and pummel his ribs, but many cigarettes and much whisky\ntold, and he was ready to laugh foolishly and make peace when,\nat the end of the sixth round, he felt Bill's neat little fist\nin a straight--and entirely accidental--rip to the point of\nhis jaw.\n",
                "Pete sent his opponent spinning with a back-hander which awoke\nall the cruelty of the terrible Bill.  Silently Bill Wrenn\nplunged in with a smash! smash! smash! like a murderous savage,\nusing every grain of his strength.\n",
                "Let us turn from the lamentable luck of Pete.  He had now got the\nidea that his supposed victim could really fight.  Dismayed, shocked,\ndisgusted, he stumbled and sought to flee, and was sent flat.\n",
                "This time it was the great little Bill who had to be dragged\noff.  McGarver held him, kicking and yammering, his mild\nmustache bristling like a battling cat's, till the next round,\nwhen Pete was knocked out by a clumsy whirlwind of fists.\n",
                "He lay on the deck, with Bill standing over him and demanding,\n\"What's my name, _heh?_\"\n",
                "\"I t'ink it's Bill now, all right, Wrennie, old hoss--Bill, old\nhoss,\" groaned Pete.\n",
                "He was permitted to sneak off into oblivion.\n",
                "Bill Wrenn went below.  In the dark passage by the fidley he\nfell to tremorous weeping.  But the brackish hydrant water that\nstopped his nose-bleed saved him from hysterics.  He climbed to\nthe top deck, and now he could again see his brother pilgrim,\nthe moon.\n",
                "The stiffs and bosses were talking excitedly of the fight.\nTim rushed up to gurgle:  \"Great, Bill, old man!  You done just\nwhat I'd 'a' done if he'd cussed me.  I told you Pete was a bluffer.\"\n",
                "\"Git out,\" said Satan.\n",
                "Tim fled.\n",
                "Morton came up, looked at Bill Wrenn, pounded him on the shoulder,\nand went off to his mattress.  The other stiffs slouched away,\nbut McGarver and Satan were still discussing the fight.\n",
                "Snuggling on the hard black pile of tarpaulins, Bill talked to\nthem, warmed to them, and became Mr. Wrenn.  He announced his\ndetermination to wander adown every shining road of Europe.\n",
                "\"Nice work.\"  \"Sure.\"  \"You'll make a snappy little ole\nglobe-trotter.\"  \"Sure; ought to be able to get the slickest\nkind of grub for four bits a day.\"  \"Nice work,\" Satan\ninterjected from time to time, with smooth irony.  \"Sure.\nGo ahead.  Like to hear your plans.\"\n",
                "McGarver broke in:  \"Cut that out, Marvin.  You're a `Satan' all\nright.  Quit your kidding the little man.  He's all right.  And\nhe done fine on the job last three-four days.\"\n",
                "Lying on his mattress, Bill stared at the network of the\nratlines against the brilliant sky.  The crisscross lines made\nhim think of the ruled order-blanks of the Souvenir Company.\n",
                "\"Gee!\" he mused, \"I'd like to know if Jake is handling my work\nthe way we--they--like it.  I'd like to see the old office again,\nand Charley Carpenter, just for a couple of minutes.  Gee!\nI wish they could have seen me put it all over Pete to-night!\nThat's what I'm going to do to the blooming Englishmen if they\ndon't like me.\"\n",
                "The S.S. _Merian_ panted softly beside the landing-stage at\nBirkenhead, Liverpool's Jersey City, resting in the sunshine\nafter her voyage, while the cattle were unloaded.  They had\nencountered fog-banks at the mouth of the Mersey River.  Mr.\nWrenn had ecstatically watched the shores of\nEngland--_England!_--ride at him through the fog, and had panted\nover the lines of English villas among the dunes.  It was like\na dream, yet the shore had such amazingly safe solid colors,\nreal red and green and yellow, when contrasted with the fog-wet\ndeck unearthily glancing with mist-lights.\n",
                "Now he was seeing his first foreign city, and to Morton,\nstolidly curious beside him, he could say nothing save \"Gee!\"\nWith church-tower and swarthy dome behind dome, Liverpool lay\nacross the Mersey.  Up through the Liverpool streets that ran\ndown to the river, as though through peep-holes slashed straight\nback into the Middle Ages, his vision plunged, and it wandered\nunchecked through each street while he hummed:\n",
                "\"Free, free, in Eu-ro-pee, that's _me!_\"\n",
                "The cattlemen were called to help unload the remaining hay.\nThey made a game of it.  Even Satan smiled, even the Jewish\nelders were lightly affable as they made pretendedly fierce\ngestures at the squat patient hay-bales.  Tim, the hatter,\ndanced a limber foolish jig upon the deck, and McGarver\nbellowed, \"The bon-nee bon-nee banks of Loch Lo-o-o-o-mond.\"\n",
                "The crowd bawled:  \"Come on, Bill Wrenn; your turn.  Hustle up\nwith that bale, Pete, or we'll sic Bill on you.\"\n",
                "Bill Wrenn, standing very dignified, piped:  \"I'm Colonel\nArmour.  I own all these cattle, 'cept the Morris uns, see?\nGotta do what I say, savvy?  Tim, walk on your ear.\"\n",
                "The hatter laid his head on the deck and waved his anemic legs\nin accordance with directions from Colonel Armour (late Wrenn).\n",
                "The hay was off.  The _Merian_ tooted and headed across the\nMersey to the Huskinson Dock, in Liverpool, while the cattlemen\nplayed tag about the deck.  Whooping and laughing, they made\nlast splashy toilets at the water-butts, dragged out their\nluggage, and descended to the dock-house.\n",
                "As the cattlemen passed Bill Wrenn and Morton, shouting\naffectionate good-bys in English or courteous Yiddish, Bill\ncommented profanely to Morton on the fact that the solid stone\nfloor of the great shed seemed to have enough sea-motion to\n\"make a guy sick.\" It was nearly his last utterance as Bill Wrenn.\nHe became Mr. Wrenn, absolute Mr. Wrenn, on the street,\nas he saw a real English bobby, a real English carter, and the\nsign, \"Cocoa House.  Tea _Id_.\"\n",
                "England!\n",
                "\"Now for some real grub!\" cried Morton.  \"No more scouse and\nwillow-leaf tea.\"\n",
                "Stretching out their legs under a table glorified with toasted\nSally Lunns and Melton Mowbrays, served by a waitress who said\n\"Thank _you_\" with a rising inflection, they gazed at the line of\nmirrors running Britishly all around the room over the long\nlounge seat, and smiled with the triumphant content which comes\nto him whose hunger for dreams and hunger for meat-pies are\nsatisfied together.\n"

                "\"Say, for the love of Mike, Wrenn, get wise!  Get wise, son!\nI'm not going to sponge on you, and that's all there is to it.\"\n",
                "Bill Wrenn strode into their company for a minute, and quoth the\nterrible Bill:\n",
                "\"Well, you don't need to get so sore about it.  I don't go\naround asking folks can I give 'em a meal ticket all the time,\nlet me tell you, and when I do--Oh rats!  Say, I didn't mean to\nget huffy, Morty.  But, doggone you, old man, you can't shake me\nthis easy.  I sye, old top, I'm peeved; yessir.  We'll go Dutch\nto a lodging-house, or even walk the streets.\"\n",
                "\"All right, sir; all right.  I'll take you up on that.  We'll\nsleep in an areaway some place.\"\n",
                "They walked to the outskirts of Liverpool, questing the desirable\ndark alley.  Awed by the solid quietude and semigrandeur of the\nlarge private estates, through narrow streets where dim trees\nleaned over high walls whose long silent stretches were broken\nonly by mysterious little doors, they tramped bashfully,\ninspecting, but always rejecting, nooks by lodge gates.\n",
                "They came to a stone church with a porch easily reached from the\nstreet, a large and airy stone porch, just suited, Morton\ndeclared, \"to a couple of hoboes like us.  If a bobby butts in,\nwhy, we'll just slide under them seats.  Then the bobby can go\nsoak his head.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn had never so far defied society as to steal a place\nfor sleeping.  He felt very uneasy, like a man left naked on the\nstreet by robbers, as he rolled up his coat for a pillow and\nremoved his shoes in a place that was perfectly open to the\nstreet.  The paved floor was cold to his bare feet, and, as he\ntried to go to sleep, it kept getting colder and colder to his\nback.  Reaching out his hand, he fretfully rubbed the cracks\nbetween stones.  He scowled up at the ceiling of the porch.\nHe couldn't bear to look out through the door, for it framed the\nvicar's house, with lamplight bodying forth latticed windows,\nsuggesting soft beds and laughter and comfortable books.  All\nthe while his chilled back was aching in new places.\n",
                "He sprang up, put on his shoes, and paced the churchyard.  It\nseemed a great waste of educational advantages not to study the\ntower of this foreign church, but he thought much more about his\naching shoulder-blades.\n",
                "Morton came from the porch stiff but grinning.  \"Didn't like it\nmuch, eh, Bill?  Afraid you wouldn't.  Must say I didn't either,\nthough.  Well, come on.  Let's beat it around and see if we\ncan't find a better place.\"\n",
                "In a vacant lot they discovered a pile of hay.  Mr. Wrenn hardly\nwinced at the hearty slap Morton gave his back, and he\npronounced, \"Some Waldorf-Astoria, that stack!\" as they sneaked\ninto the lot.  They had laid loving hands upon the hay,\nremarking, \"Well, I _guess!_\" when they heard from a low stable\nat the very back of the lot:\n",
                "\"I say, you chaps, what are you doing there?\"\n",
                "A reflective carter, who had been twisting two straws, ambled\nout of the shadow of the stable and prepared to do battle.\n",
                "\"Say, old man, can't we sleep in your hay just to-night?\" argued\nMorton.  \"We're Americans.  Came over on a cattle-boat.  We\nain't got only enough money to last us for food,\" while Mr.\nWrenn begged, \"Aw, please let us.\"\n",
                "\"Oh!  You're Americans, are you?  You seem decent enough.  I've\ngot a brother in the States.  He used to own this stable with\nme.  In St. Cloud, Minnesota, he is, you know.  Minnesota's some\nkind of a shire.  Either of you chaps been in Minnesota?\"\n",
                "\"Sure,\" lied Morton; \"I've hunted bear there.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I say, bear now!  My brother's never written m--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, that was way up in the northern part, in the Big Woods.\nI've had some narrow escapes.\"\n",
                "Then Morton, who had never been west of Pittsburg, sang somewhat\nin this wise the epic of the hunting he had never done:\n",
                "Alone.  Among the pines.  Dead o' winter.  Only one shell in his\nrifle.  Cold of winter.  Snow--deep snow.  Snow-shoes.  Hiking\nalong--reg'lar mushing--packing grub to the lumber-camp.  Way up\nnear the Canadian border.  Cold, terrible cold.  Stars looked\nlike little bits of steel.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn thought he remembered the story.  He had read it in a\nmagazine.  Morton was continuing:\n",
                "Snow stretched out among the pines.  He was wearing a Mackinaw\nand shoe-packs.  Saw a bear loping along.  He had--Morton had--a\n.44-.40 Marlin, but only one shell.  Thrust the muzzle of his\nrifle right into the bear's mouth.  Scared for a minute.  Almost\nfell off his snow-shoes.  Hardest thing he ever did, to pull that\ntrigger.  Fired.  Bear sort of jumped at him, then rolled over, clawing.\nGreat place, those Minnesota Big--\n",
                "\"What's a shoe-pack?\"  the Englishman stolidly interjected.\n",
                "\"Kind of a moccasin....  Great place, those woods.  Hope your\nbrother gets the chance to get up there.\"\n",
                "\"I say, I wonder did you ever meet him?  Scrabble is his name,\nJock Scrabble.\"\n",
                "\"Jock Scrabble--no, but _say!_  By golly, there was a fellow up in\nthe Big Woods that came from St. Cl--St. Cloud?  Yes, that was\nit.  He was telling us about the town.  I remember he said your\nbrother had great chances there.\"\n",
                "The Englishman meditatively accepted a bad cigar from Mr. Wrenn.\nSuddenly:  \"You chaps can sleep in the stable-loft if you'd\nlike.  But you must blooming well stop smoking.\"\n",
                "So in the dark odorous hay-mow Mr. Wrenn stretched out his legs\nwith an affectionate \"good night\" to Morton.  He slept nine\nhours.  When he awoke, at the sound of a chain clanking in the\nstable below, Morton was gone.  This note was pinned to his\nsleeve:\n",
                "DEAR OLD MAN,--I still feel sure that you will not enjoy the\nhiking.  Bumming is not much fun for most people, I don't think,\neven if they say it is.  I do not want to live on you.  I always\ndid hate to graft on people.  So I am going to beat it off\nalone.  But I hope I will see you in N Y & we will enjoy many a\ngood laugh together over our trip.  If you will phone the P. R.\nR. you can find out when I get back & so on.  As I do not know\nwhat your address will be.  Please look me up & I hope you will\nhave a good trip.\n                                   Yours truly,\n                                        HARRY P. MORTON.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn lay listening to the unfriendly rattling of the chain\nharness below for a long time.  When he crawled languidly down\nfrom the hay-loft he glowered in a manner which was decidedly\nsurly even for Bill Wrenn at a middle-aged English stranger who\nwas stooping over a cow's hoof in a stall facing the ladder.\n",
                "\"Wot you doing here?\" asked the Englishman, raising his head and\nregarding Mr. Wrenn as a housewife does a cockroach in the\nsalad-bowl.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn was bored.  This seemed a very poor sort of man; a\nbloated Cockney, with a dirty neck-cloth, vile cuffs of grayish\nblack, and a waistcoat cut foolishly high.\n",
                "\"The owner said I could sleep here,\" he snapped.\n",
                "\"Ow.  'E did, did 'e?  'E ayn't been giving you any of the\nperishin' 'osses, too, 'as 'e?\"\n",
                "It was sturdy old Bill Wrenn who snarled, \"Oh, shut up!\" Bill\ndidn't feel like standing much just then.  He'd punch this\nfellow as he'd punched Pete, as soon as not--or even sooner.\n",
                "\"Ow....  It's shut up, is it?...  I've 'arf a mind to set the\n'tecs on you, but I'm lyte.  I'll just 'it you on the bloody nowse.\"\n",
                "Bill Wrenn stepped off the ladder and squared at him.  He was\nsorry that the Cockney was smaller than Pete.\n",
                "The Cockney came over, feinted in an absent-minded manner, made\nswift and confusing circles with his left hand, and hit Bill\nWrenn on the aforesaid bloody nose, which immediately became a\nbleeding nose.  Bill Wrenn felt dizzy and, sitting on a\ngrain-sack, listened amazedly to the Cockney's apologetic:\n",
                "\"I'm sorry I ayn't got time to 'ave the law on you, but I could\nspare time to 'it you again.\"\n",
                "Bill shook the blood from his nose and staggered at the Cockney,\nwho seized his collar, set him down outside the stable with a\njarring bump, and walked away, whistling:\n",
                "               \"Come, oh come to our Sunday-school,\n               Ev-v-v-v-v-v-ry Sunday morn-ing.\"\n",
                "\"Gee!\" mourned Mr. William Wrenn, \"and I thought I was getting\nthis hobo business down pat....  Gee!  I wonder if Pete _was_ so\nhard to lick?\"\n"

                "Sadly clinging to the plan of the walking-trip he was to have\nmade with Morton, Mr. Wrenn crossed by ferry to Birkenhead,\nquite unhappily, for he wanted to be discussing with Morton the\nquaintness of the uniformed functionaries.  He looked for the\n_Merian_ half the way over.  As he walked through Birkenhead,\nbound for Chester, he pricked himself on to note red-brick\nhouse-rows, almost shocking in their lack of high front stoops.\nAlong the country road he reflected:  \"Wouldn't Morty enjoy\nthis!  Farm-yard all paved.  Haystack with a little roof on it.\nKitchen stove stuck in a kind of fireplace.  Foreign as the deuce.\"\n",
                "But Morton was off some place, in a darkness where there weren't\nthings to enjoy.  Mr. Wrenn had lost him forever.  Once he heard\nhimself wishing that even Tim, the hatter, or \"good old\nMcGarver\" were along.  A scene so British that it seemed proper\nto enjoy it alone he did find in a real garden-party, with what\nappeared to be a real curate, out of a story in _The Strand_,\npassing teacups; but he passed out of that hot glow into a cold\nplodding that led him to Chester and a dull hotel which might as\nwell have been in Bridgeport or Hoboken.\n",
                "He somewhat timidly enjoyed Chester the early part of the next\nday, docilely following a guide about the walls, gaping at the\nmill on the Dee and asking the guide two intelligent questions\nabout Roman remains.  He snooped through the galleried streets,\npeering up dark stairways set in heavy masonry that spoke of\nhistoric sieges, and imagined that he was historically besieging.\nFor a time Mr. Wrenn's fancies contented him.\n",
                "He smiled as he addressed glossy red and green postcards to Lee\nTheresa and Goaty, Cousin John and Mr. Guilfogle, writing on\neach a variation of \"Having a splendid trip.  This is a very\ninteresting old town.  Wish you were here.\" Pantingly, he found\na panorama showing the hotel where he was staying--or at least\ntwo of its chimneys--and, marking it with a heavy cross and the\nannouncement \"This is my hotel where I am staying,\" he sent it\nto Charley Carpenter.\n",
                "He was at his nearest to greatness at Chester Cathedral.\nHe chuckled aloud as he passed the remains of a refectory of\nmonastic days, in the close, where knights had tied their\nromantically pawing chargers, \"just like he'd read about in a\nstory about the olden times.\"  He was really there.  He glanced\nabout and assured himself of it.  He wasn't in the office.  He\nwas in an English cathedral close!\n",
                "But shortly thereafter he was in an English temperance hotel,\nsitting still, almost weeping with the longing to see Morton.\nHe walked abroad, feeling like an intruder on the lively night\ncrowd; in a tap-room he drank a glass of English porter and\ntried to make himself believe that he was acquainted with the\nothers in the room, to which theory they gave but little\nsupport.  All this while his loneliness shadowed him.\n",
                "Of that loneliness one could make many books; how it sat down\nwith him; how he crouched in his chair, be-spelled by it, till\nhe violently rose and fled, with loneliness for companion in his\nflight.  He was lonely.  He sighed that he was \"lonely as fits.\"\nLonely--the word obsessed him.  Doubtless he was a bit mad, as\nare all the isolated men who sit in distant lands longing for\nthe voices of friendship.\n",
                "Next morning he hastened to take the train for Oxford to get\naway from his loneliness, which lolled evilly beside him in\nthe compartment.  He tried to convey to a stodgy North\nCountryman his interest in the way the seats faced each other.\nThe man said \"Oh aye?\" insultingly and returned to his\nManchester newspaper.\n",
                "Feeling that he was so offensive that it was a matter of honor\nfor him to keep his eyes away, Mr. Wrenn dutifully stared out of\nthe door till they reached Oxford.\n",
                "There is a calm beauty to New College gardens.  There is, Mr.\nWrenn observed, \"something simply _slick_ about all these old\nquatrangleses,\" crossed by summering students in short flappy\ngowns.  But he always returned to his exile's room, where he now\nbegan to hear the new voice of shapeless nameless Fear--fear of\nall this alien world that didn't care whether he loved it or not.\n",
                "He sat thinking of the cattle-boat as a home which he had loved\nbut which he would never see again.  He had to use force on\nhimself to keep from hurrying back to Liverpool while there\nstill was time to return on the same boat.\n",
                "No!  He was going to \"stick it out somehow, and get onto the\nhang of all this highbrow business.\"\n",
                "Then he said:  \"Oh, darn it all.  I feel rotten.  I wish I was dead!\"\n",
                "\"Those, sir, are the windows of the apartment once occupied by\nWalter Pater,\" said the cultured American after whom he was\ntrailing.  Mr. Wrenn viewed them attentively, and with shame\nremembered that he didn't know who Walter Pater was.  But--oh\nyes, now he remembered; Walter was the guy that 'd murdered his\nwhole family.  So, aloud, \"Well, I guess Oxford's sorry Walt\never come here, all right.\"\n",
                "\"My dear sir, Mr. Pater was the most immaculate genius of the\nnineteenth century,\" lectured Dr. Mittyford, the cultured\nAmerican, severely.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn had met Mittyford, Ph.D., near the barges; had, upon\npolite request, still more politely lent him a match, and seized\nthe chance to confide in somebody.  Mittyford had a bald head,\nneat eye-glasses, a fair family income, a chatty good-fellowship\nat the Faculty Club, and a chilly contemptuousness in his\nrhetoric class-room at Leland Stanford, Jr., University.  He\nwrote poetry, which he filed away under the letter \"P\" in his\nletter-file.\n",
                "Dr. Mittyford grudgingly took Mr. Wrenn about, to teach him what\nnot to enjoy.  He pointed at Shelley's rooms as at a\ncertificated angel's feather, but Mr. Wrenn writhingly admitted\nthat he had never heard of Shelley, whose name he confused with\nMax O'Rell's, which Dr. Mittyford deemed an error.  Then,\nPater's window.  The doctor shrugged.  Oh well, what could you\nexpect of the proletariat!  Swinging his stick aloofly, he\nstalked to the Bodleian and vouchsafed, \"That, sir, is the\n_AEschylus_ Shelley had in his pocket when he was drowned.\"\n",
                "Though he heard with sincere regret the news that his new idol\nwas drowned, Mr. Wrenn found that _AEschylus_ left him cold.  It\nseemed to be printed in a foreign language.  But perhaps it was\nmerely a very old book.\n",
                "Standing before a case in which was an exquisite book in a queer\nwrigglesome language, bearing the legend that from this volume\nFitzgerald had translated the _Rubaiyat_, Dr. Mittyford waved his\nhand and looked for thanks.\n",
                "\"Pretty book,\" said Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "\"And did you note who used it?\"\n",
                "\"Uh--yes.\"  He hastily glanced at the placard.  \"Mr. Fitzgerald.\nSay, I think I read some of that Rubaiyat.  It was something\nabout a Persian kitten--I don't remember exactly.\"\n",
                "Dr. Mittyford walked bitterly to the other end of the room.\n",
                "About eight in the evening Mr. Wrenn's landlady knocked with,\n\"There's a gentleman below to see you, sir.\"\n",
                "\"Me?\" blurted Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "He galloped down-stairs, panting to himself that Morton had at\nlast found him.  He peered out and was overwhelmed by a\nmotor-car, with Dr. Mittyford waiting in awesome fur coat,\ngoggles, and gauntlets, centered in the car-lamplight that\nloomed in the shivery evening fog.\n",
                "\"Gee! just like a hero in a novel!\" reflected Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "\"Get on your things,\" said the pedagogue.  \"I'm going to give\nyou the time of your life.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn obediently went up and put on his cap.  He was\nexcited, yet frightened and resentful at being \"dragged into all\nthis highbrow business\" which he had resolutely been putting\naway the past two hours.\n",
                "As he stole into the car Dr. Mittyford seemed comparatively\nhuman, remarking:  \"I feel bored this evening.  I thought I would\ngive you a _nuit blanche_.  How would you like to go to the Red\nUnicorn at Brempton--one of the few untouched old inns?\"\n",
                "\"That would be nice,\" said Mr. Wrenn, unenthusiastically.\n",
                "His chilliness impressed Dr. Mittyford, who promptly told one of\nthe best of his well-known whimsical yet scholarly stories.\n",
                "\"Ha! ha!\" remarked Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "He had been saying to himself:  \"By golly!  I ain't going to even\ntry to be a society guy with him no more.  I'm just going to be\n_me_, and if he don't like it he can go to the dickens.\"\n",
                "So he was gentle and sympathetic and talked West Sixteenth\nStreet slang, to the rhetorician's lofty amusement.\n",
                "The tap-room of the Red Unicorn was lighted by candles and\na fireplace.  That is a simple thing to say, but it was not a\nsimple thing for Mr. Wrenn to see.  As he observed the trembling\nshadows on the sanded floor he wriggled and excitedly murmured,\n\"Gee!...  Gee whittakers!\"\n",
                "The shadows slipped in arabesques over the dust-gray floor and\nscampered as bravely among the rafters as though they were in\nsuch a tale as men told in believing days.  Rustics in smocks\ndrank ale from tankards; and in a corner was snoring an\near-ringed peddler with his beetle-black head propped on an\noilcloth pack.\n",
                "Stamping in, chilly from the ride, Mr. Wrenn laughed aloud.\nWith a comfortable feeling on the side toward the fire he stuck\nhis slight legs straight out before the old-time settle, looked\ndevil-may-care, made delightful ridges on the sanded floor with\nhis toe, and clapped a pewter pot on his knee with a small\nemphatic \"Wop!\"  After about two and a quarter tankards he broke\nout,  \"Say, that peddler guy there, don't he look like he was a\ngipsy--you know--sneaking through the hedges around the\nmanner-house to steal the earl's daughter, huh?\"\n",
                "\"Yes....  You're a romanticist, then, I take it?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, I guess I am.  Kind of.  Like to read romances and stuff.\"\nHe stared at Mittyford beseechingly.  \"But, say--say, I wonder\nwhy--Somehow, I haven't enjoyed Oxford and the rest of the places\nlike I ought to.  See, I'd always thought I'd be simply nutty about\nthe quatrangles and stuff, but I'm afraid they're too highbrow for\nme.  I hate to own up, but sometimes I wonder if I can get away\nwith this traveling stunt.\"\n",
                "Mittyford, the magnificent, had mixed ale and whisky punch.\nHe was mellowly instructive:\n",
                "\"Do you know, I've been wondering just what you _would_ get out\nof all this.  You really have a very fine imagination of a sort,\nyou know, but of course you're lacking in certain factual bases.\nAs I see it, your _metier_ would be to travel with a pleasant\nwife, the two of you hand in hand, so to speak, looking at the\nmore obvious public buildings and plesaunces--avenues and\nplesuances.  There must be a certain portion of the tripper\nclass which really has the ability `for to admire and for to see.'\"\n",
                "Dr. Mittyford finished his second toddy and with a wave of his\nhand presented to Mr. Wrenn the world and all the plesaunces\nthereof, for to see, though not, of course, to admire Mittyfordianly.\n",
                "\"But--what are you to do now about Oxford?  Well, I'm afraid\nyou're taken into captivity a bit late to be trained for that\nsort of thing.  Do about Oxford?  Why, go back, master the world\nyou understand.  By the way, have you seen my book on _Saxon\nDerivatives?_  Not that I'm prejudiced in its favor, but it might\ngive you a glimmering of what this difficile thing `culture'\nreally is.\"\n",
                "The rustics were droning a church anthem.  The glow of the ale\nwas in Mr. Wrenn.  He leaned back, entirely happy, and it seemed\nconfusedly to him that what little he had heard of his learned\nand affectionate friend's advice gratefully confirmed his own\ntheory that what one wanted was friends--a \"nice wife\"--folks.\n\"Yes, sir, by golly!  It was awfully nice of the Doc.\"  He\npictured a tender girl in golden brown back in the New York he\nso much desired to see who would await him evenings with a smile\nthat was kept for him.  Homey--that was what _he_ was going to be!\nHe happily and thoughtfully ran his finger about the rim of his\nglass ten times.\n",
                "\"Time to go, I' m afraid,\" Dr. Mittyford was saying.  Through\nthe exquisite haze that now filled the room Mr. Wrenn saw him\ndimly, as a triangle of shirt-front and two gleaming ellipses\nfor eyes....  His dear friend, the Doc!...  As he walked through\nthe room chairs got humorously in his way, but he good-naturedly\npicked a path among them, and fell asleep in the motor-car.  All\nthe ride back he made soft mouse-like sounds of snoring.\n",
                "When he awoke in the morning with a headache and surveyed his\nunchangeably dingy room he realized slowly, after smothering his\nhead in the pillow to shut off the light from his scorching\neyeballs, that Dr. Mittyford had called him a fool for trying to\nwander.  He protested, but not for long, for he hated to venture\nout there among the dreadfully learned colleges and try to\nunderstand stuff written in letters that look like crow-tracks.\n",
                "He packed his suit-case slowly, feeling that he was very wicked\nin leaving Oxford's opportunities.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn rode down on a Tottenham Court Road bus, viewing the\nquaintness of London.  Life was a rosy ringing valiant pursuit,\nfor he was about to ship on a Mediterranean steamer laden\nchiefly with adventurous friends.  The bus passed a victoria\ncontaining a man with a real monocle.  A newsboy smiled up at him.\nThe Strand roared with lively traffic.\n",
                "But the gray stonework and curtained windows of the\nAnglo-Southern Steamship Company's office did not invite any Mr.\nWrenns to come in and ship, nor did the hall porter, a beefy\nperson with a huge collar and sparse painfully sleek hair, whose\neyes were like cold boiled mackerel as Mr. Wrenn yearned:\n",
                "\"Please--uh--please will you be so kind and tell me where I can\nship as a steward for the Med--\"\n",
                "\"None needed.\"\n",
                "\"Or Spain?  I just want to get any kind of a job at first.\nPeeling potatoes or--It don't make any difference--\"\n",
                "\"None needed, I said, my man.\" The porter examined the hall\nclock extensively.\n",
                "Bill Wrenn suddenly popped into being and demanded:  \"Look here,\nyou; I want to see somebody in authority.  I want to know what\nI _can_ ship as.\"\n",
                "The porter turned round and started.  All his faith in mankind\nwas destroyed by the shock of finding the fellow still there.\n\"Nothing, I told you.  No one needed.\"\n",
                "\"Look here; can I see somebody in authority or not?\"\n",
                "The porter was privately esteemed a wit at his motherin-law's.\nWaddling away, he answered,  \"Or not.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn drooped out of the corridor.  He had planned to see the\nTate Gallery, but now he hadn't the courage to face the\ndifficulties of enjoying pictures.  He zig-zagged home, mourning:\n\"What's the use.  And I'll be hung if I'll try any other\noffices, either.  The icy mitt, that's what they hand you here.\nSome day I'll go down to the docks and try to ship there.\nProb'ly.  Gee!  I feel rotten!\"\n",
                "Out of all this fog of unfriendliness appeared the waitress at\nthe St. Brasten Cocoa House; first, as a human being to whom he\ncould talk, second, as a woman.  She was ignorant and vulgar;\nshe misused English cruelly; she wore greasy cotton garments,\nplanted her large feet on the floor with firm clumsiness, and\nalways laughed at the wrong cue in his diffident jests.  But she\ndid laugh; she did listen while he stammered his ideas of\nmeat-pies and St. Paul's and aeroplanes and Shelley and fog and\ntan shoes.  In fact, she supposed him to be a gentleman and\nscholar, not an American.\n",
                "He went to the cocoa-house daily.\n",
                "She let him know that he was a man and she a woman, young and\nkindly, clear-skinned and joyous-eyed.  She touched him with\nwarm elbow and plump hip, leaning against his chair as he gave\nhis order.  To that he looked forward from meal to meal, though he\nnever ceased harrowing over what he considered a shameful intrigue.\n",
                "That opinion of his actions did not keep him from tingling one\nlunch-time when he suddenly understood that she was expecting to\nbe tempted.  He tempted her without the slightest delay,\nmuttering,  \"Let's take a walk this evening?\"\n",
                "She accepted.  He was shivery and short of breath while he was\ntrying to smile at her during the rest of the meal, and so he\nremained all afternoon at the Tower of London, though he very\nwell knew that all this history--\"kings and gwillotines and\nstuff\"--demanded real Wrenn thrills.\n",
                "They were to meet on a street-corner at eight.  At seven-thirty\nhe was waiting for her.  At eight-thirty he indignantly walked\naway, but he hastily returned, and stood there another\nhalf-hour.  She did not come.\n",
                "When he finally fled home he was glad to have escaped the great\nmystery of life, then distressingly angry at the waitress, and\ndesolate in the desert stillness of his room.\n",
                "He sat in his cold hygienic uncomfortable room on Tavistock\nPlace trying to keep his attention on the \"tick, tick, tick,\ntick\" of his two-dollar watch, but really cowering before the\nvast shadowy presences that slunk in from the hostile city.\n",
                "He didn't in the least know what he was afraid of.  The actual\nEnglishman whom he passed on the streets did not seem to\nthreaten his life, yet his friendly watch and familiar suit-case\nseemed the only things he could trust in all the menacing world\nas he sat there, so vividly conscious of his fear and loneliness\nthat he dared not move his cramped legs.\n",
                "The tension could not last. For a time he was able to laugh at\nhimself, and he made pleasant pictures--Charley Carpenter\ntelling him a story at Drubel's; Morton companionably smoking on\nthe top deck; Lee Theresa flattering him during an evening walk.\nMost of all he pictured the brown-eyed sweetheart he was going\nto meet somewhere, sometime.  He thought with sophomoric shame\nof his futile affair with the waitress, then forgot her as he\nseemed almost to touch the comforting hand of the brown-eyed girl.\n",
                "\"Friends, that's what I want.  You bet!\"  That was the work\nhe was going to do--make acquaintances.  A girl who would\nunderstand him, with whom he could trot about, seeing\ndepartment-store windows and moving-picture shows.\n",
                "It was then, probably, hunched up in the dowdy chair of faded\nupholstery, that he created the two phrases which became his\nformula for happiness.  He desired \"somebody to go home to evenings\";\nstill more, \"some one to work with and work for.\"\n",
                "It seemed to him that he had mapped out his whole life.  He sat\nback, satisfied, and caught the sound of emptiness in his room,\nemphasized by the stilly tick of his watch.\n",
                "\"Oh--Morton--\" he cried.\n",
                "He leaped up and raised the window.  It was raining, but through\nthe slow splash came the night rattle of hostile London.  Staring\ndown, he studied the desolate circle of light a street-lamp cast\non the wet pavement.  A cat gray as dish-water, its fur worn off\nin spots, lean and horrible, sneaked through the circle of light\nlike the spirit of unhappiness, like London's sneer at solitary\nAmericans in Russell Square rooms.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn gulped.  Through the light skipped a man and a girl,\nso little aware of him that they stopped, laughingly, wrestling\nfor an umbrella, then disappeared, and the street was like a\nforgotten tomb.  A hansom swung by, the hoofbeats sharp and\ncheerless.  The rain dripped.  Nothing else.  Mr. Wrenn slammed\ndown the window.\n",
                "He smoothed the sides of his suit-case and reckoned the number\nof miles it had traveled with him.  He spun his watch about on\nthe table, and listened to its rapid mocking speech, \"Friends,\nfriends; friends, friends.\"\n",
                "Sobbing, he began to undress, laying down each garment as though\nhe were going to the scaffold.  When the room was dark the great\nshadowy forms of fear thronged unchecked about his narrow dingy bed.\n",
                "Once during the night he woke.  Some sound was threatening him.\nIt was London, coming to get him and torture him.  The light in\nhis room was dusty, mottled, gray, lifeless.  He saw his door,\nhalf ajar, and for some moments lay motionless, watching stark\nand bodiless heads thrust themselves through the opening and\nwithdraw with sinister alertness till he sprang up and opened\nthe door wide.\n",
                "But he did not even stop to glance down the hall for the crowd\nof phantoms that had gathered there.  Some hidden manful scorn\nof weakness made him sneer aloud,  \"Don't be a baby even if you\n_are_ lonely.\"\n",
                "His voice was deeper than usual, and he went to bed to sleep,\nthrowing himself down with a coarse wholesome scorn of his\nnervousness.\n",
                "He awoke after dawn, and for a moment curled in happy wriggles\nof satisfaction over a good sleep.  Then he remembered that he\nwas in the cold and friendless prison of England, and lay there\npanting with desire to get away, to get back to America, where\nhe would be safe.\n",
                "He wanted to leap out of bed, dash for the Liverpool train, and\ntake passage for America on the first boat.  But perhaps the\nofficials in charge of the emigrants and the steerage (and of\ncourse a fellow would go steerage to save money) would want to\nknow his religion and the color of his hair--as bad as trying to\nship.  They might hold him up for a couple of days.  There were\nquarantines and customs and things, of which he had heard.\nPerhaps for two or even three days more he would have to stay in\nthis nauseating prison-land.\n",
                "This was the morning of August 3, 1910, two weeks after his\narrival in London, and twenty-two days after victoriously\nreaching England, the land of romance.\n"

                "Mr. Wrenn was sulkily breakfasting at Mrs. Cattermole's Tea\nHouse, which Mrs. Cattermole kept in a genteel fashion in a\nbasement three doors from his rooming-house on Tavistock Place.\nAfter his night of fear and tragic portents he resented the\ngeneral flowered-paper-napkin aspect of Mrs. Cattermole's\nestablishment.  \"Hungh!\" he grunted, as he jabbed at the fringed\ndoily under the silly pink-and-white tea-cup on the\ngreen-and-white lacquered tray brought him by a fat waitress in\na frilly apron which must have been made for a Christmas\npantomime fairy who was not fat.  \"Hurump!\" he snorted at the\npictures of lambs and radishes and cathedrals and little duckies\non Mrs. Cattermole's pink-and-white wall.\n",
                "He wished it were possible--which, of course, it was not--to go\nback to the St. Brasten Cocoa House, where he could talk to the\nhonest flat-footed galumping waitress, and cross his feet under\nhis chair.  For here he was daintily, yes, daintily, studied by\nthe tea-room habitues--two bouncing and talkative daughters of an\nAmerican tourist, a slender pale-haired English girl student of\nAssyriology with large top-barred eye-glasses over her\nprotesting eyes, and a sprinkling of people living along\nTavistock Place, who looked as though they wanted to know if\nyour opinions on the National Gallery and abstinence were sound.\n",
                "His disapproval of the lambiness of Mrs. Cattermole's was turned\nto a feeling of comradeship with the other patrons as he turned,\nwith the rest, to stare hostilely at a girl just entering.  The\ntalk in the room halted, startled.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn gasped.  With his head solemnly revolving, his eyes\nfollowed the young woman about his table to a table opposite.\n\"A freak!  Gee, what red hair!\" was his private comment.\n",
                "A slender girl of twenty-eight or twenty-nine, clad in a\none-piece gown of sage-green, its lines unbroken by either belt\nor collar-brooch, fitting her as though it had been pasted on,\nand showing the long beautiful sweep of her fragile thighs and\nlong-curving breast.  Her collar, of the material of the dress,\nwas so high that it touched her delicate jaw, and it was set off\nonly by a fine silver chain, with a La Valliere of silver and\ncarved Burmese jade.  Her red hair, red as a poinsettia, parted\nand drawn severely back, made a sweep about the fair dead-white\nskin of her bored sensitive face.  Bored blue-gray eyes, with\npathetic crescents of faintly violet-hued wrinkles beneath them,\nand a scarce noticeable web of tinier wrinkles at the side.\nThin long cheeks, a delicate nose, and a straight strong mouth\nof thin but startlingly red lips.\n",
                "Such was the new patron of Mrs. Cattermole.\n",
                "She stared about the tea-room like an officer inspecting raw\nrecruits, sniffed at the stare of the thin girl student, ordered\nbreakfast in a low voice, then languidly considered her toast\nand marmalade.  Once she glanced about the room.  Her heavy\nbrows were drawn close for a second, making a deep-cleft wrinkle\nof ennui over her nose, and two little indentations, like the\nimpressions of a box corner, in her forehead over her brows.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn's gaze ran down the line of her bosom again, and he\nwondered at her hands, which touched the heavy bread-and-butter\nknife as though it were a fine-point pen.  Long hands, colored\nlike ivory; the joint wrinkles etched into her skin; orange\ncigarette stains on the second finger; the nails--\n",
                "He stared at them.  To himself he commented,  \"Gee! I never did\nsee such freak finger-nails in my life.\"  Instead of such\nsmoothly rounded nails as Theresa Zapp displayed, the new young\nlady had nails narrow and sharp-pointed, the ends like little\ntriangles of stiff white writing-paper.\n",
                "As she breakfasted she scanned Mr. Wrenn for a second.  He was\ntoo obviously caught staring to be able to drop his eyes.  She\nstudied him all out, with almost as much interest as a policeman\ngives to a passing trolley-car, yawned delicately, and forgot him.\n",
                "Though you should penetrate Greenland or talk anarchism to the\ndaughter of a millionaire grocer, never shall you feel a more\ndevouring chill than enveloped Mr. Wrenn as the new young lady\nglanced away from him, paid her check, rose slithily from her\ntable, and departed.  She rounded his table; not stalking out of\nits way, as Theresa would have done, but bending from the hips.\nThus was it revealed to Mr. Wrenn that--\n",
                "He was almost too horrified to put it into words....  He had\nnoticed that there was something kind of funny in regard to her\nwaist; he had had an impression of remarkably smooth waist\ncurves and an unjagged sweep of back.  Now he saw that--It\nwas unheard of; not at all like Lee Theresa Zapp or ladies in\nthe Subway.  For--the freak girl wasn't wearing corsets!\n",
                "When she had passed him he again studied her back, swiftly and\ncovertly.  No, sir.  No question about it.  It couldn't be\ndenied by any one now that the girl was a freak, for, charitable\nthough Our Mr. Wrenn was, he had to admit that there was no sign\nof the midback ridge and little rounded knobbinesses of corseted\nrespectability.  And he had a closer view of the texture of her\nsage-green crash gown.\n",
                "\"Golly!\" he said to himself; \"of all the doggone cloth for a\ndress!  Reg'lar gunny-sacking.  She's skinny, too.  Bright-red\nhair.  She sure is the prize freak.  Kind of good-looking,\nbut--get a brick!\"\n",
                "He hated to rule so clever-seeming a woman quite out of court.\nBut he remembered her scissors glance at him, and his soft\nlittle heart became very hard.\n",
                "How brittle are our steel resolves!  When Mr. Wrenn walked out of\nMrs. Cattermole's excellent establishment and heavily inspected\nthe quiet Bloomsbury Street, with a cat's-meat-man stolidly\nclopping along the pavement, as loneliness rushed on him and he\nwondered what in the world he could do, he mused,  \"Gee! I bet\nthat red-headed lady would be interestin' to know.\"\n",
                "A day of furtive darts out from his room to do London, which\nglumly declined to be done.  He went back to the Zoological\nGardens and made friends with a tiger which, though it\npresumably came from an English colony, was the friendliest\nthing he had seen for a week.  It did yawn, but it let him talk\nto it for a long while.  He stood before the bars, peering in,\nand whenever no one else was about he murmured:  \"Poor fella,\nthey won't let you go, heh?  You got a worse boss 'n Goglefogle,\nheh?  Poor old fella.\"\n",
                "He didn't at all mind the disorder and rancid smell of the cage;\nhe had no fear of the tiger's sleek murderous power.  But he was\nsomewhat afraid of the sound of his own tremorous voice.  He had\nspoken aloud so little lately.\n",
                "A man came, an Englishman in a high offensively well-fitting\nwaistcoat, and stood before the cage.  Mr. Wrenn slunk away,\nrobbed of his new friend, the tiger, the forlornest person in all\nLondon, kicking at pebbles in the path.\n",
                "As half-dusk made the quiet street even more detached, he sat on\nthe steps of his rooming-house on Tavistock Place, keeping\nhimself from the one definite thing he wanted to do--the thing\nhe keenly imagined a happy Mr. Wrenn doing--dashing over to the\nEuston Station to find out how soon and where he could get a\ntrain for Liverpool and a boat for America.\n",
                "A girl was approaching the house.  He viewed her carelessly,\nthen intently.  It was the freak lady of Mrs. Cattermole's Tea\nHouse--the corsetless young woman of the tight-fitting crash gown\nand flame-colored hair.  She was coming up the steps of his house.\n",
                "He made room for her with feverish courtesy.  She lived in the\nsame house--He instantly, without a bit of encouragement from\nthe uninterested way in which she snipped the door to, made up\na whole novel about her.  Gee!  She was a French countess, who\nlived in a reg'lar chateau, and she was staying in Bloomsbury\nincognito, seeing the sights.  She was a noble.  She was--\n",
                "Above him a window opened.  He glanced up.  The countess incog.\nwas leaning out, scanning the street uncaringly.  Why--her\nwindows were next to his! He was living next room to an unusual\nperson--as unusual as Dr. Mittyford.\n",
                "He hurried up-stairs with a fervid but vague plan to meet her.\nMaybe she really was a French countess or somepun'.  All evening,\nsitting by the window, he was comforted as he heard her move\nabout her room.  He had a friend.  He had started that great\nwork of making friends--well, not started, but started\nstarting--then he got confused, but the idea was a flame to warm\nthe fog-chilled spaces of the London street.\n",
                "At his Cattermole breakfast he waited long.  She did not come.\nAnother day--but why paint another day that was but a smear of\nflat dull slate?  Yet another breakfast, and the lady of mystery\ncame.  Before he knew he was doing it he had bowed to her, a\nslight uneasy bend of his neck.  She peered at him, unseeing,\nand sat down with her back to him.\n",
                "He got much good healthy human vindictive satisfaction in\nevicting her violently from the French chateau he had given her,\nand remembering that, of course, she was just a \"fool freak\nEnglishwoman--prob'ly a bloomin' stoodent\" he scorned, and so\nsettled _her!_  Also he told her, by telepathy, that her new\ngown was freakier than ever--a pale-green thing, with large\nwhite buttons.\n",
                "As he was coming in that evening he passed her in the hall.  She\nwas clad in what he called a bathrobe, and what she called an\nArabian _burnoose_, of black embroidered with dull-gold\ncrescents and stars, showing a V of exquisite flesh at her\nthroat.  A shred of tenuous lace straggled loose at the opening\nof the _burnoose_.  Her radiant hair, tangled over her forehead,\nshone with a thousand various gleams from the gas-light over her\nhead as she moved back against the wall and stood waiting for\nhim to pass.  She smiled very doubtfully, distantly--the smile,\nhe felt, of a great lady from Mayfair.  He bobbed his head,\nlowered his eyes abashedly, and noticed that along the shelf of\nher forearm, held against her waist, she bore many silver toilet\narticles, and such a huge heavy fringed Turkish bath-towel as he\nhad never seen before.\n",
                "He lay awake to picture her brilliant throat and shining hair.\nHe rebuked himself for the lack of dignity in \"thinking of that\nfreak, when she wouldn't even return a fellow's bow.\"  But her\nshimmering hair was the star of his dreams.\n",
                "Napping in his room in the afternoon, Mr. Wrenn heard slight\nactive sounds from her, next room.  He hurried down to the stoop.\n",
                "She stood behind him on the door-step, glaring up and down the\nstreet, as bored and as ready to spring as the Zoo tiger.  Mr.\nWrenn heard himself saying to the girl,  \"Please, miss, do you\nmind telling me--I'm an American; I'm a stranger in London--I\nwant to go to a good play or something and what would I--what\nwould be good--\"\n",
                "\"I don't know, reahlly,\" she said, with much hauteur.\n\"Everything's rather rotten this season, I fancy.\"  Her voice\nran fluting up and down the scale.  Her a's were very broad.\n",
                "\"Oh--oh--y-you _are_ English, then?\"\n",
                "\"Yes!\"\n",
                "\"Why--uh--\"\n",
                "\"_Yes!_\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I just had a fool idea maybe you might be French.\"\n",
                "\"Perhaps I am, y' know.  I'm not reahlly English,\" she said, blandly.\n",
                "\"Why--uh--\"\n",
                "\"What made you think I was French?  Tell me; I'm interested.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I guess I was just--well, it was almost make-b'lieve--how\nyou had a castle in France--just a kind of a fool game.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, _don't_ be ashamed of imagination,\" she demanded, stamping\nher foot, while her voice fluttered, low and beautifully\ncontrolled, through half a dozen notes.  \"Tell me the rest of\nyour story about me.\"\n",
                "She was sitting on the rail above him now.  As he spoke she\ncupped her chin with the palm of her delicate hand and observed\nhim curiously.\n",
                "\"Oh, nothing much more.  You were a countess--\"\n",
                "\"Please!  Not just `were.'  Please, sir, mayn't I be a countess now?\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes, of course you are!\" he cried, delight submerging\ntimidity.  \"And your father was sick with somepun' mysterious,\nand all the docs shook their heads and said  `Gee! we dunno what\nit is,' and so you sneaked down to the treasure-chamber--you\nsee, your dad--your father, I should say--he was a cranky old\nFrenchman--just in the story, you know.  He didn't think you\ncould do anything yourself about him being mysteriously sick.\nSo one night you--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, was it dark?  Very _very_ dark?  And silent?  And my\nfootsteps rang on the hollow flagstones?  And I swiped the gold\nand went forth into the night?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, _yes!_  That's it.\"\n",
                "\"But why did I swipe it?\"\n",
                "\"I'm just coming to that,\" he said, sternly.\n",
                "\"Oh, please, sir, I'm awful sorry I interrupted.\"\n",
                "\"It was like this:  You wanted to come over here and study\nmedicine so's you could cure your father.\"\n",
                "\"But please, sir,\" said the girl, with immense gravity, \"mayn't\nI let him die, and not find out what's ailing him, so I can\nmarry the _maire?_\"\n",
                "\"Nope,\" firmly, \"you got to--Say, _gee!_ I didn't expect to\ntell you all this make-b'lieve....  I'm afraid you'll think\nit's awful fresh of me.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I loved it--really I did--because you liked to make it up\nabout poor Istra.  (My name is Istra Nash.)  I'm sorry to say I'm\nnot reahlly\"--her two \"reallys\" were quite different--\"a countess,\nyou know.  Tell me--you live in this same house, don't you?\nPlease tell me that you're not an interesting Person.  Please!\"\n",
                "\"I--gee! I guess I don't quite get you.\"\n",
                "\"Why, stupid, an Interesting Person is a writer or an artist or\nan editor or a girl who's been in Holloway Jail or Canongate for\nsuffraging, or any one else who depends on an accident to be\ntolerable.\"\n",
                "\"No, I'm afraid not; I'm just a kind of clerk.\"\n",
                "\"Good!  Good!  My dear sir--whom I've never seen before--have I?\nBy the way, please don't think I usually pick up stray gentlemen\nand talk to them about my pure white soul.  But you, you know,\nmade stories about me....  I was saying:  If you could only know\nhow I loathe and hate and despise Interesting People just now!\nI've seen so much of them.  They talk and talk and talk--they're\njust like Kipling's bandar-log--What is it?\n",
                "               \"See us rise in a flung festoon\n               Half-way up to the jealous moon.\n               Don't you wish you--\n",

You don't mind my\ncomparing you to a butler, do you?  He was really quite the\nnicest person in the play, y' know.  Most of it was gorgeously\nrotten.  It used to be a French farce, but they sent it to\nSunday-school and gave it a nice fresh frock.  It seemed that a\ngentleman-tabby had been trying to make a match between his\nnephew and his ward.  The ward arted.  Personally I think it\nwas by tonsorial art.  But, anyway, the uncle knew that nothing\nbrings people together so well as hating the same person.

A guy, he admonished\nhimself, just had to have coin when he was goin' with a girl\nlike Miss Istra.  At least seven times he darted up from the\ndoor-step, where he was on watch for her, and briskly trotted as\nfar as the corner.  Each time his courage melted, and he slumped\nback to the door-step.

In a few minutes\nhe dashed to his bureau and brushed his thinning hair so\nnervously that he had to try three times for a straight parting.\nWhile brushing his eyebrows and mustache he solemnly\ncontemplated himself in the mirror.\n",
                "\"I look like a damn rabbit,\" he scorned, and marched half-way to\nIstra's room.  He went back to change his tie to a navy-blue bow\nwhich made him appear younger.  He was feeling rather resentful\nat everything, including Istra, as he finally knocked and heard\nher  \"Yes?  Come in.\"\n",
                "There was in her room a wonderful being lolling in a wing-chair,\none leg over the chair-arm; a young young man, with broken brown\nteeth, always seen in his perpetual grin, but a godlike Grecian\nnose, a high forehead, and bristly yellow hair.  The being wore\nlarge round tortoise-shell spectacles, a soft shirt with a\ngold-plated collar-pin, and delicately gray garments.\n",
                "Istra was curled on the bed in a leaf-green silk kimono with a\ngreat gold-mounted medallion pinned at her breast.  Mr. Wrenn\ntried not to be shocked at the kimono.\n",
                "She had been frowning as he came in and fingering a long thin\ngreen book of verses, but she glowed at Mr. Wrenn as though he\nwere her most familiar friend, murmuring, \"Mouse dear, I'm _so_\nglad you could come in.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn stood there awkwardly.  He hadn't expected to find\nanother visitor.  He seemed to have heard her call him \"Mouse.\"\nYes, but what did Mouse mean?  It wasn't his name at all.  This\nwas all very confusing.  But how awful glad she was to see him!\n",
                "\"Mouse dear, this is one of our best little indecent poets, Mr.\nCarson Haggerty.  From America--California--too.  Mr. Hag'ty,\nMr. Wrenn.\"\n",
                "\"Pleased meet you,\" said both men in the same tone of annoyance.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn implored:  \"I--uh--I thought you might like to look at\nthese magazines.  Just dropped in to give them to you.\"  He was\nready to go.\n",
                "\"Thank you--so good of you.  _Please_ sit down.  Carson and I\nwere only fighting--he's going pretty soon.  We knew each other\nat art school in Berkeley.  Now he knows all the toffs in London.\"\n",
                "\"Mr. Wrenn,\" said the best little poet, \"I hope you'll back up\nmy contention.  Izzy says th--\"\n",
                "\"Carson, I have told you just about enough times that I do not\nintend to stand for `Izzy' any more!  I should think that even\n_you_ would be able to outgrow the standard of wit that obtains in\nfirst-year art class at Berkeley.\"\n",
                "Mr. Haggerty showed quite all of his ragged teeth in a noisy\njoyous grin and went on, unperturbed:  \"Miss Nash says that the\nbest European thought, personally gathered in the best salons,\nshows that the Rodin vogue is getting the pickle-eye from all\nthe real yearners.  What is your opinion?\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn turned to Istra for protection.  She promptly\nannounced:  \"Mr. Wrenn absolutely agrees with me.  By the way,\nhe's doing a big book on the recrudescence of Kipling, after his\nslump, and--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, come off, now!  Kipling!  Blatant imperialist, anti-Stirner!\"\ncried Carson Haggerty, kicking out each word with the assistance\nof his swinging left foot.\n",
                "Much relieved that the storm-center had passed over him, Mr.\nWrenn sat on the front edge of a cane-seated chair, with the\nmagazines between his hands, and his hands pressed between his\nforward-cocked knees.  Always, in the hundreds of times he went\nover the scene in that room afterward, he remembered how cool\nand smooth the magazine covers felt to the palms of his\nflattened hands.  For he associated the papery surfaces with the\napprehension he then had that Istra might give him up to the\njag-toothed grin of Carson Haggerty, who would laugh him out of\nthe room and out of Istra's world.\n",
                "He hated the poetic youth, and would gladly have broken all of\nCarson's teeth short off.  Yet the dread of having to try the\nfeat himself made him admire the manner in which Carson tossed\nabout long creepy-sounding words, like a bush-ape playing with\nscarlet spiders.  He talked insultingly of Yeats and the\ncommutation of sex-energy and Isadora Duncan and the poetry of\nCarson Haggerty.\n",
                "Istra yawned openly on the bed, kicking a pillow, but she was\nsurprised into energetic discussion now and then, till Haggerty\nintentionally called her Izzy again, when she sat up and\nremarked to Mr. Wrenn:  \"Oh, don't go yet.  You can tell me about\nthe article when Carson goes.  Dear Carson said he was only\ngoing to stay till ten.\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn hadn't had any intention of going, so he merely smiled\nand bobbed his head to the room in general, and stammered\n\"Y-yes,\" while he tried to remember what he had told her about\nsome article.  Article.  Perhaps it was a Souvenir Company\nnovelty article.  Great idea!  Perhaps she wanted to design a\nmotto for them.  He decidedly hoped that he could fix it up for\nher--he'd sure do his best.  He'd be glad to write over to Mr.\nGuilfogle about it.  Anyway, she seemed willing to have him\nstick here.\n",
                "Yet when dear Carson had jauntily departed, leaving the room\nstill loud with the smack of his grin, Istra seemed to have\nforgotten that Mr. Wrenn was alive.  She was scowling at a book\non the bed as though it had said things to her.  So he sat quiet\nand crushed the magazine covers more closely till the silence\nchoked him, and he dared, \"Mr. Carson is an awful well-educated man.\"\n",
                "\"He's a bounder,\" she snapped.  She softened her voice as she\ncontinued:  \"He was in the art school in California when I was\nthere, and he presumes on that....  It was good of you to stay\nand help me get rid of him....  I'm getting--I'm sorry I'm so\ndull to-night.  I suppose I'll get sent off to bed right now, if\nI can't be more entertaining.  It was sweet of you to come in,\nMouse....  You don't mind my calling you `Mouse,' do you?  I\nwon't, if you do mind.\"\n",
                "He awkwardly walked over and laid the magazines on the bed.\n\"Why, it's all right....  What was it about some novelty--some\narticle?  If there's anything I could do--anything--\"\n",
                "\"Article?\"\n",
                "\"Why, yes.  That you wanted to see me about.\"\n",
                "\"Oh!  Oh, that was just to get rid of Carson....  His\n_insufferable_ familiarity!  The penalty for my having been a\nnaive kiddy, hungry for friendship, once.  And now, good n--.\nOh, Mouse, he says my eyes--even with this green kimono on--\nCome here, dear.  tell me what color my eyes are.\"\n",
                "She moved with a quick swing to the side of her bed.  Thrusting\nout her two arms, she laid ivory hands clutchingly on his\nshoulder.  He stood quaking, forgetting every one of the\nWrennish rules by which he had edged a shy polite way through\nlife.  He fearfully reached out his hands toward her shoulders\nin turn, but his arms were shorter than hers, and his hands\nrested on the sensitive warmth of her upper arms.  He peered at\nthose dear gray-blue eyes of hers, but he could not calm himself\nenough to tell whether they were china-blue or basalt-black.\n",
                "\"Tell me,\" she demanded; \"_aren't_ they green?\"\n",
                "\"Yes,\" he quavered.\n",
                "\"You're sweet,\" she said.\n",
                "Leaning out from the side of her bed, she kissed him.  She\nsprang up, and hastened to the window, laughing nervously, and\ndeploring:  \"I shouldn't have done that!  I shouldn't!  Forgive\nme!\"  Plaintively, like a child:  \"Istra was so bad, so bad.  Now\nyou must go.\"  As she turned back to him her eyes had the peace\nof an old friend's.\n",
                "Because he had wished to be kind to people, because he had been\npitiful toward Goaty Zapp, Mr. Wrenn was able to understand that\nshe was trying to be a kindly big sister to him, and he said\n\"Good night, Istra,\" and smiled in a lively way and walked out.\nHe got out the smile by wrenching his nerves, for which he paid\nin agony as he knelt by his bed, acknowledging that Istra would\nnever love him and that therefore he was not to love, would be\na fool to love, never would love her--and seeing again her white\narms softly shadowed by her green kimono sleeves.\n",
                "No sight of Istra, no scent of her hair, no sound of her\nalways-changing voice for two days.  Twice, seeing a sliver of\nlight under her door as he came up the darkened stairs, he\nknocked, but there was no answer, and he marched into his room\nwith the dignity of fury.\n",
                "Numbers of times he quite gave her up, decided he wanted never\nto see her again.  But after one of the savagest of these\nrenunciations, while he was stamping defiantly down Tottenham\nCourt Road, he saw in a window a walking-stick that he was sure\nshe would like his carrying.  And it cost only two-and-six.\nHastily, before he changed his mind, he rushed in and slammed\ndown his money.  It was a very beautiful stick indeed, and of a\nmodesty to commend itself to Istra, just a plain straight stick\nwith a cap of metal curiously like silver.  He was conscious\nthat the whole world was leering at him, demanding \"What're _you_\ncarrying a cane for?\" but he--the misunderstood--was willing\nto wait for the reward of this martyrdom in Istra's approval.\n",
                "The third night, as he stood at the window watching two children\nplaying in the dusk, there was a knock.  It was Istra.  She\nstood at his door, smart and inconspicuous in a black suit with\na small toque that hid the flare of her red hair.\n",
                "\"Come,\" she said, abruptly.  \"I want you to take me to\nOlympia's--Olympia Johns' flat.  I've been reading all the\nBalzac there is.  I want to talk.  Can you come?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, of course--\"\n",
                "\"Hurry, then!\"\n",
                "He seized his small foolishly round hat, and he tucked his new\nwalking-stick under his arm without displaying it too proudly,\nwaiting for her comment.\n",
                "She led the way down-stairs and across the quiet streets and\nsquares of Bloomsbury to Great James Street.  She did not even\nsee the stick.\n",
                "She said scarce a word beyond:\n",
                "\"I'm sick of Olympia's bunch--I never want to dine in Soho with\nan inhibition and a varietistic sex instinct again--_jamais de\nla vie._  But one has to play with somebody.\"\n",
                "Then he was so cheered that he tapped the pavements boldly with\nhis stick and delicately touched her arm as they crossed the\nstreet.  For she added:\n",
                "\"We'll just run in and see them for a little while, and then you\ncan take me out and buy me a Rhine wine and seltzer....  Poor\nMouse, it shall have its play!\"\n",
                "Olympia Johns' residence consisted of four small rooms.  When\nIstra opened the door, after tapping, the living-room was\noccupied by seven people, all interrupting one another and\ndrinking fourpenny ale; seven people and a fog of cigarette\nsmoke and a tangle of papers and books and hats.  A swamp of\nunwashed dishes appeared on a large table in the room just\nbeyond, divided off from the living-room by a burlap curtain to\nwhich were pinned suffrage buttons and medallions.  This last he\nremembered afterward, thinking over the room, for the medals'\nglittering points of light relieved his eyes from the\nintolerable glances of the people as he was hastily introduced\nto them.  He was afraid that he would be dragged into a\ndiscussion, and sat looking away from them to the medals, and to\nthe walls, on which were posters, showing mighty fists with\nhammers and flaming torches, or hog-like men lolling on the\nchests of workmen, which they seemed to enjoy more than the\nworkmen.  By and by he ventured to scan the group.\n",
                "Carson Haggerty, the American poet, was there.  But the center\nof them all was Olympia Johns herself--spinster, thirty-four, as\nsmall and active and excitedly energetic as an ant trying to get\naround a match.  She had much of the ant's brownness and\nslimness, too.  Her pale hair was always falling from under her\nfillet of worn black velvet (with the dingy under side of the\nvelvet showing curled up at the edges).  A lock would tangle in\nfront of her eyes, and she would impatiently shove it back with\na jab of her thin rough hands, never stopping in her machine-gun\nvolley of words.\n",
                "\"Yes, yes, yes, yes,\" she would pour out.  \"Don't you _see?_\nWe must do something.  I tell you the conditions are intolerable,\nsimply intolerable.  We must _do_ something.\"\n",
                "The conditions were, it seemed, intolerable in the several\nbranches of education of female infants, water rates in\nBloomsbury, the cutlery industry, and ballad-singing.\n",
                "And mostly she was right.  Only her rightness was so demanding,\nso restless, that it left Mr. Wrenn gasping.\n",
                "Olympia depended on Carson Haggerty for most of the \"Yes, that's\nso's,\" though he seemed to be trying to steal glances at another\nwoman, a young woman, a lazy smiling pretty girl of twenty, who,\nIstra told Mr. Wrenn, studied Greek archaeology at the Museum.\nNo one knew why she studied it.  She seemed peacefully ignorant\nof everything but her kissable lips, and she adorably poked at\nthings with lazy graceful fingers, and talked the Little\nLanguage to Carson Haggerty, at which Olympia shrugged her\nshoulders and turned to the others.\n",
                "There were a Mr. and Mrs. Stettinius--she a poet; he a bleached\nman, with goatish whiskers and a sanctimonious white neck-cloth,\nwho was Puritanically, ethically, gloomily, religiously\natheistic.  Items in the room were a young man who taught in Mr.\nJeney's Select School and an Established Church mission worker\nfrom Whitechapel, who loved to be shocked.\n",
                "It was Mr. Wrenn who was really shocked, however, not by the\nnoise and odor; not by the smoking of the women; not by the\ndemand that \"we\" tear down the state; no, not by these was Our\nMr. Wrenn of the Souvenir Company shocked, but by his own\nfascinated interest in the frank talk of sex.  He had always had\na quite undefined supposition that it was wicked to talk of sex\nunless one made a joke of it.\n",
                "Then came the superradicals, to confuse the radicals who\nconfused Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "For always there is a greater rebellion; and though you\nsell your prayer-book to buy Bakunine, and esteem yourself\nrevolutionary to a point of madness, you shall find one who\ncalls you reactionary.  The scorners came in together--Moe\nTchatzsky, the syndicalist and direct actionist, and Jane\nSchott, the writer of impressionistic prose--and they sat\nsilently sneering on a couch.\n",
                "Istra rose, nodded at Mr. Wrenn, and departed, despite Olympia's\nhospitable shrieks after them of  \"Oh stay!  It's only a little\nafter ten.  Do stay and have something to eat.\"\n",
                "Istra shut the door resolutely.  The hall was dark.  It was\ngratefully quiet.  She snatched up Mr. Wrenn's hand and held it\nto her breast.\n",
                "\"Oh, Mouse dear, I'm so bored!  I want some real things.  They\ntalk and talk in there, and every night they settle all the fate\nof all the nations, always the same way.  I don't suppose\nthere's ever been a bunch that knew more things incorrectly.\nYou hated them, didn't you?\"\n",
                "\"Why, I don't think you ought to talk about them so severe,\" he\nimplored, as they started down-stairs.  \"I don't mean they're\nlike you.  They don't savvy like you do.  I mean it!  But I was\nawful int'rested in what that Miss Johns said about kids in\nschool getting crushed into a mold.  Gee! that's so; ain't it?\nNever thought of it before.  And that Mrs. Stettinius talked\nabout Yeats so beautiful.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, my dear, you make my task so much harder.  I want you to\nbe different.  Can't you see your cattle-boat experience is realer\nthan any of the things those half-baked thinkers have done?  I\n_know_.  I'm half-baked myself.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, I've never done nothing.\"\n",
                "\"But you're ready to.  Oh, I don't know.  I want--I wish Jock\nSeton--the filibuster I met in San Francisco--I wish he were\nhere.  Mouse, maybe I can make a filibuster of you.  I've got to\ncreate something.  Oh, those people!  If you just knew them!  That\nfool Mary Stettinius is mad about that Tchatzsky person, and her\nhusband invites him to teas.  Stettinius is mad about Olympia,\nwho'll probably take Carson out and marry him, and he'll keep on\nhanging about the Greek girl.  Ungh!\"\n",
                "\"I don't know--I don't know--\"\n",
                "But as he didn't know what he didn't know she merely patted his\narm and said, soothingly:  \"I won't criticize your first\nspecimens of radicals any more.  They are trying to do something,\nanyway.\" Then she added, in an irrelevant tone,  \"You're exactly\nas tall as I am.  Mouse dear, you ought to be taller.\"\n",
                "They were entering the drab stretch of Tavistock Place, after a\nsilence as drab, when she exclaimed:  \"Mouse, I am _so_ sick of\neverything.  I want to get out, away, anywhere, and do\nsomething, anything, just so's it's different.  Even the\ncountry.  I'd like--Why couldn't we?\"\n",
                "\"Let's go out on a picnic to-morrow, Istra.\"\n",
                "\"A picnic picnic?  With pickles and a pillow cushion and several\nkinds of cake?...  I'm afraid the Bois Boulogne has spoiled me\nfor that....  Let me think.\"\n",
                "She drooped down on the steps of their house.  Her head back,\nher supple strong throat arched with the passion of hating\nboredom, she devoured the starlight dim over the stale old roofs\nacross the way.\n",
                "\"Stars,\" she said.  \"Out on the moors they would come down by\nyou....  What is _your_ adventure--your formula for it?...  Let's\nsee; you take common roadside things seriously; you'd be dear\nand excited over a Red Lion Inn.\"\n",

Mist was\ndripping and blind and silent about them, weaving its heavy gray\nwith the night.  Suddenly Istra caught his arm at the gate to a\nfarm-yard, and cried,  \"Look!\"\n",

It's what I've always wanted--a country that's old.\nAnd different....  Thatched houses!...  And pretty soon it'll\nbe dawn, summer dawn; with you, with Istra!  _Gee!_  It's the\ndarndest adventure.\"\n",
                "\"Yes....  Come on.  Let's walk fast or we'll get sleepy, and\nthen your romantic heroine will be a grouchy Interesting\nPeople!...  Listen!  There's a sleepy dog barking, a million\nmiles away....  I feel like telling you about myself.  You don't\nknow me.  Or do you?\"\n",
                "\"I dunno just how you mean.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, it shall have its romance!  But some time I'll tell\nyou--perhaps I will--how I'm not really a clever person at all,\nbut just a savage from outer darkness, who pretends to\nunderstand London and Paris and Munich, and gets frightfully\nscared of them....  Wait!  Listen!  Hear the mist drip from that\ntree.  Are you nice and drowned?\"\n",
                "\"Uh--kind of.  But I been worrying about you being soaked.\"\n",
                "\"Let me see.  Why, your sleeve is wet clear through.  This khaki\nof mine keeps out the water better....  But I don't mind getting\nwet.  All I mind is being bored.  I'd like to run up this hill\nwithout a thing on--just feeling the good healthy real mist on\nmy skin.  But I'm afraid it isn't done.\"\n",
                "Mile after mile.  Mostly she talked of the boulevards and Pere\nDureon, of Debussy and artichokes, in little laughing sentences\nthat sprang like fire out of the dimness of the mist.\n",
                "Dawn came.  From a hilltop they made out the roofs of a town and\nstopped to wonder at its silence, as though through long ages\npast no happy footstep had echoed there.  The fog lifted.  The\nmorning was new-born and clean, and they fairly sang as they\nclattered up to an old coaching inn and demanded breakfast of an\namazed rustic pottering about the inn yard in a smock.  He did\nnot know that to a \"thrilling\" Mr. Wrenn he--or perhaps it was his\nsmock--was the hero in an English melodrama.  Nor, doubtless,\ndid the English crisp bacon and eggs which a sleepy housemaid\nprepared know that they were theater properties.  Why, they were\nEnglish eggs, served at dawn in an English inn--a stone-floored\nraftered room with a starling hanging in a little cage of withes\noutside the latticed window.  And there were no trippers to\nbother them!  (Mr. Wrenn really used the word \"trippers\" in his\ncogitations; he had it from Istra.)\n",

                "\"But maybe I'm just as bad.\"\n",
                "For once their tones had not been those of teacher and pupil,\nbut of comrades.  They set out from the inn through the\nbrightening morning like lively boys on a vacation tramp.\n",
                "The sun crept out, with the warmth and the dust, and Istra's\nsteps lagged.  As they passed the outlying corner of a farm\nwhere a straw-stack was secluded in a clump of willows Istra\nsmiled and sighed:  \"I'm pretty tired, dear.  I'm going to sleep\nin that straw-stack.  I've always wanted to sleep in a\nstraw-stack.  It's _comme il faut_ for vagabonds in the best set,\nyou know.  And one can burrow.  Exciting, eh?\"\n",
                "She made a pillow of her khaki jacket, while he dug down to a\ndry place for her.  He found another den on the other side of\nthe stack.\n",
                "It was afternoon when he awoke.  He sprang up and rushed around\nthe stack.  Istra was still asleep, curled in a pathetically\nsmall childish heap, her tired face in repose against the\nbrown-yellow of her khaki jacket.  Her red hair had come down\nand shone about her shoulders.\n",
                "She looked so frail that he was frightened.  Surely, too, she'd\nbe very angry with him for letting her come on this jaunt.\n",
                "He scribbled on a leaf from his address-book--religiously carried\nfor six years, but containing only four addresses--this note:\n",
                "Gone to get stuff for bxfst be right back.--W. W.\n",
                "and, softly crawling up the straw, left the note by her head.\nHe hastened to a farm-house.  The farm-wife was inclined to\nbe curious.  O curious farm-wife, you of the cream-thick Essex\nspeech and the shuffling feet, you were brave indeed to face\nBill Wrenn the Great, with his curt self-possession, for he was\non a mission for Istra, and he cared not for the goggling eyes\nof all England.  What though he was a bunny-faced man with an\ninnocuous mustache?  Istra would be awakening hungry.  That was\nwhy he bullied you into selling him a stew-pan and a bundle of\nfaggots along with the tea and eggs and a bread loaf and a jar\nof the marmalade your husband's farm had been making these two\nhundred years.  And you should have had coffee for him, not tea,\nwoman of Essex.\n",
                "When he returned to their outdoor inn the late afternoon glow\nlay along the rich fields that sloped down from their\nwell-concealed nook.  Istra was still asleep, but her cheek now\nlay wistfully on the crook of her thin arm.  He looked at the\nauburn-framed paleness of her face, its lines of thought and\nambition, unmasked, unprotected by the swift changes of\nexpression which defended her while she was awake.  He sobbed.\nIf he could only make her happy!  But he was afraid of her moods.\n",
                "He built a fire by a brooklet beyond the willows, boiled the\neggs and toasted the bread and made the tea, with cream ready in\na jar.  He remembered boyhood camping days in Parthenon and old\ncamp lore.  He returned to the stack and called, \"Istra--oh, Is-tra!\"\n",
                "She shook her head, nestled closer into the straw, then sat up,\nher hair about her shoulders.  She smiled and called down:\n\"Good morning.  Why, it's afternoon!  Did you sleep well, dear?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.  Did you?  Gee, I hope you did!\"\n",
                "\"Never better in my life.  I'm so sleepy yet.  But comfy.\nI needed a quiet sleep outdoors, and it's so peaceful here.\nBreakfast!  I roar for breakfast!  Where's the nearest house?\"\n",
                "\"Got breakfast all ready.\"\n",
                "\"You're a dear!\"\n",
                "She went to wash in the brook, and came back with eyes dancing\nand hair trim, and they laughed over breakfast, glancing down\nthe slope of golden hazy fields.  Only once did Istra pass out\nof the land of their intimacy into some hinterland of\nanalysis--when she looked at him as he drank his tea aloud out\nof the stew-pan, and wondered:  \"Is this really you here with\nme?  But you _aren't_ a boulevardier.  I must say I don't\nunderstand what you're doing here at all....  Nor a caveman,\neither.  I don't understand it....  But you _sha'n't_ be worried\nby bad Istra.  Let's see; we went to grammar-school together.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, and we were in college.  Don't you remember when I was\nbaseball captain?  You don't?  Gee, you got a bad memory!\"\n",
                "At which she smiled properly, and they were away for Suffolk again.\n",
                "\"I suppose now it'll go and rain,\" said Istra, viciously, at\ndusk.  It was the first time she had spoken for a mile.  Then,\nafter another quarter-mile:  \"Please don't mind my being silent.\nI'm sort of stiff, and my feet hurt most unromantically.  You\nwon't mind, will you?\"\n",
                "Of course he did mind, and of course he said he didn't.\nHe artfully skirted the field of conversation by very West\nSixteenth Street observations on a town through which they\npassed, while she merely smiled wearily, and at best remarked\n\"Yes, that's so,\" whether it was so or not.\n",
                "He was reflecting:  \"Istra's terrible tired.  I ought to take\ncare of her.\"  He stopped at the wood-pillared entrance of a\ntemperance inn and commanded:  \"Come!  We'll have something to\neat here.\"  To the astonishment of both of them, she meekly\nobeyed with  \"If you wish.\"\n",
                "It cannot be truthfully said that Mr. Wrenn proved himself a\nperson of _savoir faire_ in choosing a temperance hotel for their\ndinner.  Istra didn't seem so much to mind the fact that the\ntable-cloth was coarse and the water-glasses thick, and that\neverywhere the elbow ran into a superfluity of greasy pepper and\nsalt castors.  But when she raised her head wearily to peer\naround the room she started, glared at Mr. Wrenn, and accused:\n\"Are you by any chance aware of the fact that this place is\ncrowded with tourists?  There are two family parties from\nDavenport or Omaha; I _know_ they are!\"\n",
                "\"Oh, they ain't such bad-looking people,\" protested Mr.\nWrenn....  Just because he had induced her to stop for dinner\nthe poor man thought his masculine superiority had been\nrecognized.\n",
                "\"Oh, they're _terrible!_  Can't you _see_ it?  Oh, you're _hopeless_.\"\n",
                "\"Why, that big guy--that big man with the rimless spectacles\nlooks like he might be a good civil engineer, and I think that\nlady opposite him--\"\n",
                "\"They're Americans.\"\n",
                "\"So're we!\"\n",
                "\"I'm not.\"\n",
                "\"I thought--why--\"\n",
                "\"Of course I was born there, but--\"\n",
                "\"Well, just the same, I think they're nice people.\"\n",
                "\"Now see here.  Must I argue with you?  Can I have no peace,\ntired as I am?  Those trippers are speaking of `quaint English\nflavor.'  Can you want anything more than that to damn them?  And\nthey've been touring by motor--seeing every inn on the road.\"\n",
                "\"Maybe it's fun for--\"\n",
                "\"Now _don't_ argue with me.  I know what I'm talking about.\nWhy do I have to explain everything?  They're hopeless!\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn felt a good wholesome desire to spank her, but he\nsaid, most politely:  \"You're awful tired.  Don't you want to\nstay here tonight?  Or maybe some other hotel; and I'll stay here.\"\n",
                "\"No.  Don't want to stay any place.  Want to get away from\nmyself,\" she said, exactly like a naughty child.\n",
                "So they tramped on again.\n",
                "Darkness was near.  They had plunged into a country which in the\nnight seemed to be a stretch of desolate moorlands.  As they\nwere silently plodding up a hill the rain came.  It came with a\nroar, a pitiless drenching against which they fought uselessly,\nsoaking them, slapping their faces, blinding their eyes.  He\ncaught her arm and dragged her ahead.  She would be furious with\nhim because it rained, of course, but this was no time to think\nof that; he had to get her to a dry place.\n",
                "Istra laughed:  \"Oh, isn't this great!  We're real vagabonds now.\"\n",
                "\"Why!  Doesn't that khaki soak through?  Aren't you wet?\"\n",
                "\"To the skin!\" she shouted, gleefully.  \"And I don't care!\nWe're _doing_ something.  Poor dear, is it worried?  I'll race\nyou to the top of the hill.\"\n",
                "The dark bulk of a building struck their sight at the top, and\nthey ran to it.  Just now Mr. Wrenn was ready to devour alive\nany irate householder who might try to turn them out.  He found\nthe building to be a ruined stable--the door off the hinges, the\ndesolate thatch falling in.  He struck a match and, holding it\nup, standing straight, the master, all unconscious for once in\nhis deprecating life of the Wrennishness of Mr. Wrenn, he\ndiscovered that the thatch above the horse-manger was fairly\nwaterproof.\n",
                "\"Come on!  Up on the edge of the manger, Istra,\" he ordered.\n",
                "\"This is a perfectly good place for a murder,\" she grinned, as\nthey sat swinging their legs.\n",
                "He could fancy her grinning.  He was sure about it, and well content.\n",
                "\"Have I been so very grouchy, Mouse?  Don't you want to murder\nme?  I'll try to find you a long pin.\"\n",
                "\"Nope; I don't think so, much.  I guess we can get along without\nit this time.\"\n",
                "\"Oh dear, dear!  This is very dreadful.  You're so used to me now\nthat you aren't even scared of me any more.\"\n",
                "\"Gee!  I guess I'll be scared of you all right as soon as I get\nyou into a dry place, but I ain't got time now.  Sitting on a\nmanger!  Ain't this the funniest place!...  Now I must beat it\nout and find a house.  There ought to be one somewheres near here.\"\n",
                "\"And leave me here in the darknesses and wetnesses?  Not a chance.\nThe rain'll soon be over, anyway.  Really, I don't mind a bit.\nI think it's rather fun.\"\n",
                "Her voice was natural again, natural and companionable and brave.\nShe laughed as she stroked her wet shoulder and held his hand,\nsitting quietly and bidding him listen to the soft forlorn\nsound of the rain on the thatch.\n",
                "But the rain was not soon over, and their dangling position was\nvery much like riding a rail.\n",
                "\"I'm so uncomfortable!\" fretted Istra.\n",
                "\"See here, Istra, please, I think I'd better go see if I can't\nfind a house for you to get dry in.\"\n",
                "\"I feel too wretched to go any place.  Too wretched to move.\"\n",
                "\"Well, then, I'll make a fire here.  There ain't much danger.\"\n",
                "\"The place will catch fire,\" she began, querulously.\n",
                "But he interrupted her.  \"Oh, _let_ the darn place catch fire!\nI'm going to make a fire, I tell you!\"\n",
                "\"I don't want to move.  It'll just be another kind of\ndiscomfort, that's all.  Why couldn't you try and take a little\nbit of care of me, anyway?\"\n",
                "\"Oh, hon-ey!\" he wailed, in youthful bewilderment.  \"I did try\nto get you to stay at that hotel in town and get some rest.\"\n",
                "\"Well, you ought to have made me.  Don't you realize that I took\nyou along to take care of me?\"\n",
                "\"Uh--\"\n",

                "He thought instantly of Lee Theresa Zapp quarreling with her\nmother, but he said nothing.  He gathered the driest bits of\nthatch and wood he could find in the litter on the stable floor\nand kindled a fire, while she sat sullenly glaring at him, her\nface wrinkled and tired in the wan firelight.  When the blaze\nwas going steadily, a compact and safe little fire, he spread\nhis coat as a seat for her, and called, cheerily,  \"Come on now,\nhoney; here's a regular home and hearthstone for you.\"\n",
                "She slipped down from the manger edge and stood in front of him,\nlooking into his eyes--which were level with her own.\n",
                "\"You _are_ good to me,\" she half whispered, and smoothed his\ncheek, then slipped down on the outspread coat, and murmured,\n\"Come; sit here by me, and we'll both get warm.\"\n",
                "All night the rain dribbled, but no one came to drive them away\nfrom the fire, and they dozed side by side, their hands close\nand their garments steaming.  Istra fell asleep, and her head\ndrooped on his shoulder.  He straightened to bear its weight,\nthough his back twinged with stiffness, and there he sat\nunmoving, through an hour of pain and happiness and confused\nmeditation, studying the curious background--the dark roof of\nbroken thatch, the age-corroded walls, the littered earthen\nfloor.  His hand pressed lightly the clammy smoothness of the\nwet khaki of her shoulder; his wet sleeve stuck to his arm, and\nhe wanted to pull it free.  His eyes stung.  But he sat tight,\nwhile his mind ran round in circles, considering that he loved\nIstra, and that he would not be entirely sorry when he was no\nlonger the slave to her moods; that this adventure was the\nstrangest and most romantic, also the most idiotic and useless,\nin history.\n",
                "Toward dawn she stirred, and, slipping stiffly from his\nposition, he moved her so that her back, which was still wet,\nfaced the fire.  He built up the fire again, and sat brooding\nbeside her, dozing and starting awake, till morning.  Then his\nhead bobbed, and he was dimly awake again, to find her sitting\nup straight, looking at him in amazement.\n",
                "\"It simply can't be, that's all....  Did you curl me up?  I'm\nnice and dry all over now.  It was very good of you.  You've\nbeen a most commendable person....  But I think we'll take a\ntrain for the rest of our pilgrimage.  It hasn't been entirely\nsuccessful, I'm afraid.\"\n",

Then he could have wept, so\ndeeply did he desire to pull her head down on his shoulder and\nsmooth the wrinkles of weariness out of her dear face, the\ndearer because they had endured the weariness together.

Normally, you\nknow, the poor of the city cannot afford flowers till they are\ndead, and then for but one day....  He came out with a bunch of\norchids, and remembered the days when he had envied the people\nhe had seen in florists' shops actually buying flowers.

He'd write\nher a make-b'lieve letter from a duke.  Which he did.\nPurchasing a stamp, he humped over a desk in the common room and\nwith infinite pains he inked the stamp in imitation of a\npostmark and addressed the letter to \"Lady Istra Nash, Mouse\nCastle, Suffolk.\"\n",

Sir William Wrenn will hide him behind his\nchair, and if they bother you just call for Sir Percival and he\nwill tell them.  Permit us, dear Lady Nash, to wish you all the\ngreetings of the season, and in close we beg to remain, as ever,\n                              Yours sincerely,\n                                        DUKE VERE DE VERE.\n",

But\nhe sprang up, washed his prickly eyes with cold water, and began\nto dress.  He was shy of the knickers and golf-stockings, but it\nwas the orange tie that gave him real alarm.  He dared it,\nthough, and went downstairs to make sure they were setting the\ntable with glory befitting the party.\n",
                "As he went through the common room he watched the three or four\ngroups scattered through it.  They seemed to take his clothes as\na matter of course.  He was glad.  He wanted so much to be a\ncredit to Istra.\n",
                "Returning from the dining-room to the common room, he passed a\ngroup standing in a window recess and looking away from him.\nHe overheard:\n",

His collar\ndidn't come within an inch and a half of fitting his neck.  He\nmust be a poet.  I wonder if his verses are as jerry-built as his\ngarments!\"\n",

                "\"Or perhaps he has convictions about fried bananas, and dines on\na bean saute.  O Aengusmere!  Shades of Aengus!\"\n",
                "\"Not at all.  When they look as gentle as he they always hate\nthe capitalists as a militant hates a cabinet minister.

You\ncan tell he's a real artist because he's dressed like a navvy\nand--\"\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn was walking away, across the common room, quite sure\nthat every one was eying him with amusement.  And it was too\nlate to change his clothes.  It was six already.\n",
                "He stuck out his jaw, and remembered that he had planned to hide\nthe \"letter from the duke\" in Istra's napkin that it might be\nthe greater surprise.  He sat down at their table.  He tucked\nthe letter into the napkin folds.  He moved the vase of orchids\nnearer the center of the table, and the table nearer the open\nwindow giving on the green.  He rebuked himself for not being\nable to think of something else to change.  He forgot his\nclothes, and was happy.\n",
                "At six-fifteen he summoned a boy and sent him up with a message\nthat Mr. Wrenn was waiting and high tea ready.\n",

                "Mouse dear, I'm sorrier than I can tell you, but you know I\nwarrned you that bad Istra was a creature of moods, and just now\nmy mood orders me to beat it for Paris, which I'm doing, on the\n5.17 train.  I won't say good-by--I hate good-bys, they're so\nstupid, don't you think?  Write me some time, better make it\ncare Amer. Express Co., Paris, because I don't know yet just\nwhere I'll be.  And please don't look me up in Paris, because\nit's always better to end up an affair without explanations,\ndon't you think?  You have been wonderfully kind to me, and I'll\nsend you some good thought-forms, shall I?\n                                                  I. N.\n",
                "He walked to the office of the Caravanserai, blindly, quietly.\nHe paid his bill, and found that he had only fifty dollars left.\nHe could not get himself to eat the waiting high tea.  There was\na seven-fourteen train for London.  He took it.  Meantime he\nwrote out a cable to his New York bank for a hundred and fifty\ndollars.  To keep from thinking in the train he talked gravely\nand gently to an old man about the brave days of England, when\nmen threw quoits.  He kept thinking over and over, to the tune\nset by the rattling of the train trucks:  \"Friends...  I got to\nmake friends, now I know what they are....  Funny some guys don't\nmake friends.  Mustn't forget.  Got to make lots of 'em in\nNew York.  Learn how to make 'em.\"\n",

                "In a London  A. B. C. restaurant Mr. Wrenn was talking to an\nAmerican who had a clipped mustache, brisk manners, a\nKnight-of-Pythias pin, and a mind for duck-shooting, hardware-selling,\nand cigars.\n",
                "\"No more England for mine,\" the American snapped,\ngood-humoredly.  \"I'm going to get out of this foggy hole and\nget back to God's country just as soon as I can.  I want to find\nout what's doing at the store, and I want to sit down to a plate\nof flapjacks.  I'm good and plenty sick of tea and marmalade.  Why,\nI wouldn't take this fool country for a gift.  No, sir!  Me for\nGod's country--Sleepy Eye, Brown County, Minnesota. You bet!\"\n",
                "\"You don't like England much, then?\" Mr. Wrenn carefully reasoned.\n",

Like this damp crowded hole, where they can't talk\nEnglish, and have a fool coinage--Say, that's a great system,\nthat metric system they've got over in France, but here--why,\nthey don't know whether Kansas City is in Kansas or Missouri or\nboth.... `Right as rain'--that's what a fellow said to me for\n`all right'!  Ever hear such nonsense?....  And tea for breakfast!\nNot for me!  No, sir!  I'm going to take the first steamer!\"\n",

He walked nervously\nup and down till the Liverpool train departed.  \"Suppose Istra\nwanted to make up, and came back to London?\" was a terrifying\nthought that hounded him.  He dashed into the waiting-room and\nwrote to her, on a souvenir post-card showing the Abbey:  \"Called\nback to America--will write.  Address care of Souvenir Company,\nTwenty-eighth Street.\"  But he didn't mail the card.\n",
                "Once settled in a second-class compartment, with the train in\nmotion, he seemed already much nearer America, and, humming, to\nthe great annoyance of a lady with bangs, he planned his new\ngreat work--the making of friends; the discovery, some day, if\nIstra should not relent, of \"somebody to go home to.\"  There was\nno end to the \"societies and lodges and stuff\" he was going to\njoin directly he landed.\n",
                "At Liverpool he suddenly stopped at a post-box and mailed his\ncard to Istra.  That ended his debate.  Of course after that he\nhad to go back to America.\n",

I got to look him up.  Say, I\nwish we had an agency for college sofa-pillows and banners and\nsouvenir stuff in Oxford.  There's a whole bunch of colleges there,\nall right in the same town.  I met a prof. there from some American\ncollege--he hired an automobubble and took me down to a reg'lar\nold inn--\"\n",

And I see a bishop,\nwith leggins on!  But I got kind of lonely.  I thought of\nyou a lot of times.  Wished we could go out and get an ale\ntogether.  Maybe pick up a couple of pretty girls.\"\n",

                "England, in all its Istra-ness, scarce gave Mr. Wrenn a better\nthrill for his collection than the thrill he received on the\nNovember evening when he saw the white doorway of Mrs. R. T.\nFerrard, in a decorous row of houses on Thirtieth Street near\nLexington Avenue.\n",
                "It is a block where the citizens have civic pride.  A newspaper\nhas not the least chance of lying about on the asphalt--some\nhouseholder with a frequently barbered mustache will indignantly\npounce upon it inside of an hour.  No awe.  is caused by the\nsight of vestibules floored with marble in alternate black and\nwhite tiles, scrubbed not by landladies, but by maids.  There\nare dotted Swiss curtains at the basement windows and Irish\npoint curtains on the first floors.  There are two polished\nbrass doorplates in a stretch of less than eight houses.\nDistinctly, it is not a quarter where children fill the street\nwith shouting and little sticks.\n",
                "Occasionally a taxicab drives up to some door without a crowd of\nsmall boys gathering; and young men in evening clothes are not\ninfrequently seen to take out young ladies wearing tight-fitting\ngowns of black, and light scarfs over their heads.  A Middle\nWestern college fraternity has a club-house in the block, and four\nof the houses are private--one of them belonging to a police\ninspector and one to a school principal who wears spats.\n",
                "It is a block that is satisfied with itself; as different from\nthe Zapp district, where landladies in gingham run out to squabble\nwith berry-venders, as the Zapp district is from the Ghetto.\n",
                "Mrs. Arty Ferrard's house is a poor relation to most of the\nresidences there.  The black areaway rail is broken, and the\nbasement-door grill is rusty.  But at the windows are\nred-and-white-figured chintz curtains, with a $2.98 bisque\nfigurine of an unclothed lady between them; the door is of\nspotless white, with a bell-pull of polished brass.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn yanked this bell-pull with an urbane briskness which,\nhe hoped, would conceal his nervousness and delight in dining\nout.  For he was one of the lonely men in New York.  He had\ndined out four times in eight years.\n",
                "The woman of thirty-five or thirty-eight who opened the door to\nhim was very fat, two-thirds as fat as Mrs. Zapp, but she had\nyoung eyes.  Her mouth was small, arched, and quivering in a grin.\n",
                "\"This is Mr. Wrenn, isn't it?\" she gurgled, and leaned against\nthe doorpost, merry, apparently indolent.  \"I'm Mrs. Ferrard.\nMr. Poppins told me you were coming, and he said you were a\nterribly nice man, and I was to be sure and welcome you.  Come\nright in.\"\n",
                "Her indolence turned to energy as she charged down the hall to\nthe large double door on the right and threw it open, revealing\nto him a scene of splendor and revelry by night.\n",
                "Several persons [they seemed dozens, in their liveliness] were\nsinging and shouting to piano music, in the midst of a general\nredness and brightness of furnishings--red paper and worn red\ncarpet and a high ceiling with circular moldings tinted in pink.\nHand-painted pictures of old mills and ladies brooding over\nsalmon sunsets, and an especially hand-painted Christmas scene\nwith snow of inlaid mother-of-pearl, animated the walls.  On a\ngolden-oak center-table was a large lamp with a mosaic shade, and\nthrough its mingled bits of green and red and pearl glass\nstormed the brilliance of a mantle-light.\n",
                "The room was crowded with tufted plush and imitation-leather\nchairs, side-tables and corner brackets, a couch and a \"lady's\ndesk.\"  Green and red and yellow vases adorned with figures of\nyouthful lovers crammed the top of the piano at the farther end\nof the room and the polished black-marble mantel of the\nfireplace.  The glaring gas raced the hearth-fire for snap and\nglare and excitement.  The profusion of furniture was like a\ntumult; the redness and oakness and polishedness of furniture\nwas a dizzying activity; and it was all overwhelmingly magnified\nby the laughter and singing about the piano.\n",
                "Tom Poppins lumbered up from a couch of terrifically new and red\nleather, and Mr. Wrenn was introduced to the five new people in\nthe room with dismaying swiftness.  There seemed to be fifty\ntimes five unapproachable and magnificent strangers from whom he\nwanted to flee.  Of them all he was sure of only two--a Miss Nelly\nsomebody and what sounded like Horatio Hood Tem (Teddem it was).\n",
                "He wished that he had caught Miss Nelly's last name (which, at\ndinner, proved to be Croubel), for he was instantly taken by her\nsweetness as she smiled, held out a well-shaped hand, and said,\n\"So pleased meet you, Mr. Wrenn.\"\n",
                "She returned to the front of the room and went on talking to a\nlank spinster about ruchings, but Mr. Wrenn felt that he had\nknown her long and as intimately as it was possible to know so\nclever a young woman.\n",
                "Nelly Croubel gave him the impression of a delicate prettiness,\na superior sort of prettiness, like that of the daughter of the\nBig White House on the Hill, the Squire's house, at Parthenon;\nthough Nelly was not unusually pretty.  Indeed, her mouth was\ntoo large, her hair of somewhat ordinary brown.  But her face\nwas always changing with emotions of kindliness and life.  Her\nskin was perfect; her features fine, rather Greek; her smile,\nquick yet sensitive.  She was several inches shorter than Mr.\nWrenn, and all curves.  Her blouse of white silk lay tenderly\nalong the adorably smooth softness of her young shoulders.  A\nsmart patent-leather belt encircled her sleek waist.  Thin black\nlisle stockings showed a modestly arched and rather small foot\nin a black pump.\n",
                "She looked as though she were trained for business; awake,\nself-reliant, self-respecting, expecting to have to get things\ndone, all done, yet she seemed indestructibly gentle,\nindestructibly good and believing, and just a bit shy.\n",
                "Nelly Croubel was twenty-four or twenty-five in years, older in\nbusiness, and far younger in love.  She was born in Upton's\nGrove, Pennsylvania.  There, for eighteen years, she had played\nSkip to Malue at parties, hid away the notes with which the boys\ninvited her to picnics at Baptist Beach, read much Walter Scott,\nand occasionally taught Sunday-school.  Her parents died when\nshe was beginning her fourth year in high school, and she came\nto New York to work in Wanamacy's toy department at six dollars\na week during the holiday rush.  Her patience with fussy old\nshoppers and her large sales-totals had gained her a permanent\nplace in the store.\n",
                "She had loftily climbed to the position of second assistant\nbuyer in the lingerie department, at fourteen dollars and eighty\ncents a week That was quite all of her history except that she\nattended a Presbyterian church nearly every Sunday.  The only\nperson she hated was Horatio Hood Teddem, the cheap actor who\nwas playing the piano at Mr. Wrenn's entrance.\n",
                "Just now Horatio was playing ragtime with amazing rapidity,\nstamping his foot and turning his head to smirk at the others.\n",
                "Mrs. Arty led her chattering flock to the basement dining-room,\nwhich had pink wall-paper and a mountainous sideboard.  Mr.\nWrenn was placed between Mrs. Arty and Nelly Croubel.  Out of\nthe mist of strangeness presently emerged the personality of\nMiss Mary Proudfoot, a lively but religious spinster of forty\nwho made doilies for the Dorcas Women's Exchange and had two\nhundred dollars a year family income.  To the right of the\nred-glass pickle-dish were the elderly Ebbitts--Samuel Ebbitt,\nEsq., also Mrs. Ebbitt.  Mr. Ebbitt had come from Hartford five\nyears before, but he always seemed just to have come from there.\nHe was in a real-estate office; he was gray, ill-tempered,\nimpatiently honest, and addicted to rheumatism and the\nnewspapers.  Mrs. Ebbitt was addicted only to Mr. Ebbitt.\n",
                "Across the table was felt the presence of James T. Duncan, who\nlooked like a dignified red-mustached Sunday-school\nsuperintendent, but who traveled for a cloak and suit house,\ngambled heavily on poker and auction pinochle, and was esteemed\nfor his straight back and knowledge of trains.\n",
                "Which is all of them.\n",
                "As soon as Mrs. Arty had guided Annie, the bashful maid, in\nserving the vegetable soup, and had coaxed her into bringing Mr.\nWrenn a napkin, she took charge of the conversation, a luxury\nwhich she would never have intrusted to her flock's amateurish\nefforts.  Mr. Poppins, said she, had spoken of meeting a friend\nof Mr. Wrenn's;  Mr. Morton, was it not?  A very nice man, she\nunderstood.  Was it true that Mr. Wrenn and Mr. Morton had gone\nclear across the Atlantic on a cattle-boat?  It really was?\n",
                "\"Oh, how interesting!\" contributed pretty Nelly Croubel, beside\nMr. Wrenn, her young eyes filled with an admiration which caused\nhim palpitation and difficulty in swallowing his soup.  He was\nconfused by hearing old Samuel Ebbitt state:\n",
                "\"Uh-h-h-h--back in 18--uh--1872 the vessel _Prissie_--no, it was\n1873; no, it must have been '72--\"\n",
                "\"It was 1872, father,\" said Mrs. Ebbitt.\n",
                "\"1873.  I was on a coasting-vessel, young man.  But we didn't\ncarry cattle.\"  Mr. Ebbitt inspected Horatio Hood Teddem darkly,\nclicked his spectacle case sharply shut, and fell to eating,\nas though he had settled all this nonsense.\n",
                "With occasional witty interruptions from the actor, Mr. Wrenn\ntold of pitching hay, of the wit of Morton, and the wickedness\nof Satan, the boss.\n",
                "\"But you haven't told us about the brave things _you_ did,\" cooed\nMrs. Arty.  She appealed to Nelly Croubel:  \"I'll bet he was a\ncool one.  Don't you think he was, Nelly?\"\n",
                "\"I'm sure he was.\"  Nelly's voice was like a flute.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn knew that there was just one thing in the world that\nhe wanted to do; to persuade Miss Nelly Croubel that (though he\nwas a solid business man, indeed yes, and honorable) he was a\ncool one, who had chosen, in wandering o'er this world so wide,\nthe most perilous and cattle-boaty places.  He tried to think of\nsomething modest yet striking to say, while Tom was arguing with\nMiss Mary Proudfoot, the respectable spinster, about the ethics\nof giving away street-car transfers.\n",
                "As they finished their floating custard Mr. Wrenn achieved,\n\"Do you come from New York, Miss Croubel?\" and listened to the\ntale of sleighing-parties in Upton's Grove, Pennsylvania.  He was\nabsolutely happy.\n",
                "\"This is like getting home,\" he thought.  \"And they're classy\nfolks to get home to--now that I can tell 'em apart.  Gee!\nMiss Croubel is a peach.  And brains--golly!\"\n",
                "He had a frightened hope that after dinner he would be able to\nget into a corner and talk with Nelly, but Tom Poppins conferred\nwith Horatio Hood Teddenm and called Mr. Wrenn aside.  Teddem\nhad been acting with a moving-picture company for a week, and\nhad three passes to the celebrated Waldorf Photoplay Theater.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn had bloodthirstily disapproved Horatio Hood's\neffeminate remarks, such as \"Tee _hee!_\" and \"Oh, you naughty\nman,\" but when he heard that this molly-coddle had shared in the\nglory of making moving pictures he went proudly forth with him\nand Tom.  He had no chance to speak to Mrs. Arty about taking\nthe room to be vacated.\n",
                "He wished that Charley Carpenter or the Zapps could see him\nsitting right beside an actor who was shown in the pictures\nmiraculously there before them, asking him how they made movies,\njust as friendly as though they had known each other always.\n",
                "He wanted to do something to entertain his friends beyond taking\nthem out for a drink.  He invited them down to his room, and\nthey came.\n",
                "Teddem was in wonderful form; he mimicked every one they saw so\namiably that Tom Poppins knew the actor wanted to borrow money.\nThe party were lovingly humming the popular song of the\ntime--\"Any Little Girl That's a Nice Little Girl is the Right\nLittle Girl for Me\"--as they frisked up the gloomy steps of the\nZapps.  Entering, Poppins and Teddem struck attitudes on the\ninside stairs and sang aloud.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn felt enormously conscious of Mrs. Zapp down below.  He\nkept listening, as he led them up-stairs and lighted the gas.\nBut Teddem so imitated Colonel Roosevelt, with two water-glasses\nfor eye-glasses and a small hat-brush for mustache, that Mr.\nWrenn was moved wrigglingly to exclaim:  \"Say, I'm going out and\nget some beer.  Or 'd you rather have something else?  Some\ncheese sandwiches?  How about 'em?\"\n",
                "\"Fine,\" said Tom and Teddem together.\n",
                "Not only did Mr. Wrenn buy a large newspaper-covered bundle of\nbottles of beer and Swiss-cheese sandwiches, but also a small\ncan of caviar and salty crackers.  In his room he spread a clean\ntowel, then two clean towels, on the bureau, and arrayed the\nfeast, with two water-glasses and a shaving-mug for cups.\n",
                "Horatio Hood Teddem, spreading caviar on a sandwich, and loudly\nsinging his masterpiece, \"Waal I swan,\" stopped short and fixed\namazed eyes on the door of the room.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn hastily turned.  The light fell--as on a cliff of\ncrumbly gray rock--on Mrs. Zapp, in the open door, vast in her\nungirdled gray wrapper, her arms folded, glowering speechlessly.\n",
                "\"Mist' Wrenn,\" she began, in a high voice that promised to burst\ninto passion.\n",
                "But she was addressing the formidable adventurer, Bill Wrenn.\nHe had to protect his friends.  He sprang up and walked across\nto her.\n",
                "He said, quietly, \"I didn't hear you knock, Mrs. Zapp.\"\n",
                "\"Ah _didn't_ knock, and Ah want you should--\"\n",
                "\"Then please do knock, unless you want me to give notice.\"\n",
                "He was quivering.  His voice was shrill.\n",
                "From the hall below Theresa called up, \"Ma, come down here.  _Ma!_\"\n",
                "But Mrs. Zapp was too well started.  \"If you think Ah'm going\nto stand for a lazy sneaking little drunkard keeping the whole\nstreet awake, and here it is prett' nearly midnight--\"\n",
                "Just then Mr. William Wrenn saw and heard the most astounding\nthing of his life, and became an etemal slave to Tom Poppins.\n",
                "Tom's broad face became hard, his voice businesslike.  He\nshouted at Mrs. Zapp:\n",
                "\"Beat it or I'll run you in.  Trouble with you is, you old hag,\nyou don't appreciate a nice quiet little chap like Wrenn, and\nyou try to bully him--and him here for years.  Get out or I'll\nput you out.  I'm no lamb, and I won't stand for any of your\nmonkey-shines.  Get out.  This ain't your room; he's rented\nit--he's paid the rent--it's his room.  Get out!\"\n",
                "Kindly Tom Poppins worked in a cigar-store and was accustomed to\ntalk back to drunken men six feet tall.  His voice was\ntremendous, and he was fatly immovable; he didn't a bit mind the\nfact that Mrs. Zapp was still \"glaring speechless.\"\n",
                "But behold an ally to the forlorn lady.  When Theresa, in the\nhall below, heard Tom, she knew that Mr. Wrenn would room here\nno more.  She galloped up-stairs and screeched over her mother's\nshoulder:\n",
                "\"You will pick on a lady, will you, you drunken scum--you--you\ncads--I'll have you arrested so quick you--\"\n",
                "\"Look here, lady,\" said Tom, gently.  \"I'm a plain-clothes man,\na detective.\"  His large voice purred like a tiger-tabby's.  \"I\ndon't want to run you in, but I will if you don't get out of\nhere and shut that door.  Or you might go down and call the cop\non this block.  He'll run you in--for breaking Code 2762 of the\nPenal Law!  Trespass and flotsam--that's what it is!\"\n",
                "Uneasy, frightened, then horrified, Mrs. Zapp swung bulkily\nabout and slammed the door.\n",
                "Sick, guilty, banished from home though he felt, Mr. Wrenn's\nvoice quavered, with an attempt at dignity:\n",
                "\"I'm awful sorry she butted in while you fellows was here.\nI don't know how to apologize\"\n",
                "\"Forget it, old man,\" rolled out Tom's bass.  \"Come on, let's go\nup to Mrs. Arty's.\"\n",
                "\"But, gee! it's nearly a quarter to eleven.\"\n",
                "\"That's all right.  We can get up there by a little after, and\nMrs. Arty stays up playing cards till after twelve.\"\n",
                "\"Golly!\"  Mr. Wrenn agitatedly ejaculated under his breath, as\nthey noisily entered Mrs. Arty's--though not noisily on his part.\n",
                "The parlor door was open.  Mrs. Arty's broad back was toward\nthem, and she was announcing to James T. Duncan and Miss\nProudfoot, with whom she was playing three-handed Five Hundred,\n\"Well, I'll just bid seven on hearts if you're going to get so\nset up.\"  She glanced back, nodded, said, \"Come in, children,\"\npicked up the \"widow,\" and discarded with quick twitches of\nthe cards.  The frightened Mr. Wrenn, feeling like a shipwrecked\nland-lubber, compared this gaming smoking woman unfavorably with\nthe intense respectability of his dear lost patron, Mrs. Zapp.\nHe sat uneasy till the hand of cards was finished, feeling as\nthough they were only tolerating him.  And Nelly Croubel was\nnowhere in sight.\n",
                "Suddenly said Mrs. Arty,  \"And now you would like to look at that\nroom, Mr. Wrenn, unless I'm wrong.\"\n",
                "\"Why--uh--yes, I guess I would like to.\"\n",
                "\"Come with me, child,\" she said, in pretended severity.  \"Tom,\nyou take my hand in the game, and don't let me hear you've been\nbidding ten on no suit without the joker.\"  She led Mr. Wrenn to\nthe settee hat-rack in the hall.  \"The third-floor-back will be\nvacant in two weeks, Mr. Wrenn.  We can go up and look at it now\nif you'd like to.  The man who has it now works nights--he's\nsome kind of a head waiter at Rector's, or something like that,\nand he's out till three or four.  Come.\"\n",
                "When he saw that third-floor-back, the room that the smart\npeople at Mrs. Arty's were really willing to let him have, he\nfelt like a man just engaged.  It was all in soft\ngreen--grass-green matting, pale-green walls, chairs of white\nwicker with green cushions; the bed, a couch with a denim cover\nand four sofa pillows.  It gave him the impression of being a\nguest on Fifth Avenue.\n",
                "\"It's kind of a plain room,\" Mrs. Arty said, doubtfully.  \"The\nfurniture is kind of plain.  But my head-waiter man--it was\nfurnished for a friend of his--he says he likes it better than\nany other room in the house.  It _is_ comfortable, and you get\nlots of sunlight and--\"\n",
                "\"I'll take--How much is it, please, with board?\"\n",
                "She spoke with a take-it-or-leave-it defiance.  \"Eleven-fifty a week.\"\n",
                "It was a terrible extravagance; much like marrying a sick woman\non a salary of ten a week, he reflected; nine-teen minus\neleven-fifty left him only seven-fifty for clothes and savings\nand things and--but--\" I'll take it,\" he said, hastily.  He\nwas frightened at himself, but glad, very glad.  He was to live\nin this heaven; he was going to be away from that Zapp woman;\nand Nelly Croubel--Was she engaged to some man?  he wondered.\n",
                "Mrs. Arty was saying:  \"First, I want to ask you some questions,\nthough.  Please sit down.\"  As she creaked into one of the wicker\nchairs she suddenly changed from the cigarette-rolling chaffing\ncard-player to a woman dignified, reserved, commanding.  \"Mr.\nWrenn, you see, Miss Proudfoot and Miss Croubel are on this\nfloor.  Miss Proudfoot can take care of herself, all right, but\nNelly is such a trusting little thing--She's like my\ndaughter.  She's the only one I've ever given a reduced rate\nto--and I swore I never would to anybody!...  Do\nyou--uh--drink--drink much, I mean?\"\n",
                "Nelly on this floor!  Near him!  Now!  He had to have this room.\nHe forced himself to speak directly.\n",
                "\"I know how you mean, Mrs. Ferrard.  No, I don't drink much of\nany--hardly at all; just a glass of beer now and then; sometimes\nI don't even touch that a week at a time.  And I don't gamble\nand--and I do try to keep--er--straight--and all that sort of thing.\"\n",
                "\"That's good.\"\n",
                "\"I work for the Souvenir and Art Novelty Company on\nTwenty-eighth Street.  If you want to call them up I guess the\nmanager'll give me a pretty good recommend.\"\n",
                "\"I don't believe I'll need it, Mr. Wrenn.  It's my business to\nfind out what sort of animiles men are by just talking to them.\"\nShe rose, smiled, plumped out her hand.  \"You _will_ be nice to\nNelly, _won't_ you!  I'm going to fire that Teddem out--don't tell\nhim, but I am--because he gets too fresh with her.\"\n",
                "\"Yes!\"\n",
                "She suddenly broke into laughter, and ejaculated:  \"_Say_, that\nwas hard work! Don't you _hate_ to have to be serious?  Let's trot\ndown, and I'll make Tom or Duncan rush us a growler of beer to\nwelcome you to our midst....  I'll bet your socks aren't darned\nproperly.  I'm going to sneak in and take a look at them, once I\nget you caged up here....  But I won't read your love-letters!\nNow let's go down by the fire, where it's comfy.\"\n"

Well, I'm glad of it.\nI want to sleep.  I don't want to be bothered by you and your\neverlasting chatter.  Get out!'

                "\"Yes, _isn't_ it!\" he breathed.  \"It was great to be in\nEngland--though the people there are kind of chilly some ways.\nEven when I'm on a wharf here in New York I feel just like I was\noff in China or somewheres.  I'd like to see China.  And\nIndia....  Gee! when I hear the waves down at Coney Island or\nsome place--you know how the waves sound when they come in.\nWell, sometimes I almost feel like they was talking to a\nguy--you know--telling about ships.  And, oh say, you know the\nwhitecaps--aren't they just like the waves was motioning at\nyou--they want you to come and beat it with you--over to China\nand places.\"\n",

                "\"Well, I think the woman's place is in the home,\" sniffed Miss\nProudfoot, decisively, tucking away a doily she was finishing\nfor the Women's Exchange and jabbing at her bangs.\n",
                "They settled themselves about the glowing, glancing, glittering,\ngolden-oak center-table.  Miss Proudfoot shuffled sternly.  Mr.\nWrenn sat still and frightened, like a shipwrecked professor on\na raft with two gamblers and a press-agent, though Nelly was\nsmiling encouragingly at him from the couch where she had\nstarted her embroidery--a large Christmas lamp mat for the wife\nof the Presbyterian pastor at Upton's Grove.\n",

He stopped calling me, Little Buttercup,\nwhen he owed me ten dollars, and he even stopped slamming the\nfront door when he got up to twenty.  O Mr. Wrenn, did I ever\ntell you about the time I asked him if he wanted to have Annie\nsweep--\"\n",

                "\"Your bid, Mr. Poppins, \"said Miss Proudfoot, severely.\n",
                "\"First, I want to tell Wrenn how to play.  You see, Wrenn,\nhere's the schedule.  We play Avondale Schedule, you know.\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes,\" said Mr. Wrenn, timorously....  He had once heard of\nCarbondale--in New Jersey or Pennsylvania or somewhere--but that\ndidn't seem to help much.\n",
                "\"Well, you see, you either make or go back,\" continued Tom.\n\"Plus and minus, you know.  Joker is high, then right bower,\nleft, and ace.  Then--uh--let's see; high bid takes the\ncat--widdie, you know--and discards.  Ten tricks.  Follow suit\nlike whist, of course.  I guess that's all--that ought to give\nyou the hang of it, anyway.  I bid six on no trump.\"\n",
                "As Tom Poppins finished these instructions, given in the\ncard-player's rapid don't-ask-me-any-more-fool-questions manner,\nMr. Wrenn felt that he was choking.  He craned up his neck,\ntrying to ease his stiff collar.  So, then, he was a failure, a\nsocial outcast already.\n",
                "So, then, he couldn't learn Five Hundred! And he had been very\nproud of knowing one card from another perfectly, having played\na number of games of two-handed poker with Tim on the cattle-boat.\nBut what the dickens did \"left--cat--follow suit\" mean?\n",
                "And to fail with Nelly watching him!  He pulled at his collar again.\n",

                "_Tom:_  Bid up, bid up!  Bid a little seven on hearts?\n",
                "_Mrs. Arty:_  Just for that I _will_ bid seven on hearts, smarty!\n",

                "Behind Mr. Wrenn, Nelly Croubel whispered to him:  \"Bid seven on\nno suit.  You've got the joker.\"  Her delicate forefinger, its\nnail shining, was pointing at a curious card in his hand.\n",
                "\"Seven nosut,\" he mumbled.\n",

                "\"Good!  Spades--see,\" said Nelly.\n",
                "Fifteen minutes later Mr. Wrenn felt that Tom was hoping he\nwould lead a club.  He played one, and the whole table said:\n\"That's right.  Fine!\"\n",
                "On his shoulder he felt a light tap, and he blushed like a\nsunset as he peeped back at Nelly.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn, the society light, was Our Mr. Wrenn of the Souvenir\nCompany all this time.  Indeed, at present he intended to keep\non taking The Job seriously until that most mistily distant time,\nwhich we all await, \"when something turns up.\"  His fondling of\nthe Southern merchants was showing such results that he had grown\nfrom an interest in whatever papers were on his desk to a belief\nin the divine necessity of The Job as a whole.  Not now, as of old,\ndid he keep the personal letters in his desk tied up, ready for a\nsudden departure for Vienna or Kamchatka.  Also, he wished to earn\nmuch more money for his new career of luxury.  Mr. Guilfogle had\nassured him that there might be chances ahead--business had been\nprospering, two new road salesmen and a city-trade man had been\nadded to the staff, and whereas the firm had formerly been jobbers\nonly, buying their novelties from manufacturers, now they were\nhaving printed for them their own Lotsa-Snap Cardboard Office\nMottoes, which were making a big hit with the trade.\n",
                "Through his friend Rabin, the salesman, Mr. Wrenn got better\nacquainted with two great men--Mr. L. J. Glover, the\npurchasing agent of the Souvenir Company, and John Hensen, the\nnewly engaged head of motto manufacturing.  He \"wanted to get\nonto all the different lines of the business so's he could step\nright in anywhere\"; and from these men he learned the valuable\nsecrets of business wherewith the marts of trade build up\nprosperity for all of us: how to seat a selling agent facing the\nlight, so you can see his face better than he can see yours.\nHow much ahead of time to telephone the motto-printer that\n\"we've simply got to have proof this afternoon; what's the matter\nwith you, down there?  Don't you want our business any more?\"  He\nalso learned something of the various kinds of cardboard and\nink-well glass, though these, of course, were merely matters of\nknowledge, not of brilliant business tactics, and far less\nimportant than what Tom Poppins and Rabin called \"handing out a\nsnappy line of talk.\"\n",
                "\"Say, you're getting quite chummy lately--reg'lar society\nleader,\" Rabin informed him.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn's answer was in itself a proof of the soundness of\nRabin's observation:\n",
                "\"Sure--I'm going to borrow some money from you fellows.  Got to\nmake an impression, see?\"\n",
                "A few hours after this commendation came Istra's second letter:\n",
                "Mouse dear, I'm so glad to hear about the simpatico boarding-\nhouse.  Yes indeed I would like to hear about the people in it.\nAnd you are reading history?  That's good.  I'm getting sick of\nParis and some day I'm going to stop an absinthe on the\nboulevard and slap its face to show I'm a sturdy moving-picture\nWestern Amurrican and then leap to saddle and pursue the bandit.\nI'm working like the devil but what's the use.

It\nseemed so detached from himself.  \"Flair\"--\"_au recrire_.\"\nNow, what did those mean?  And Istra was always so discontented.\n\"What 'd she do if she had to be on the job like Nelly?...  Oh,\nIstra _is_ wonderful.  But--gee!--I dunno--\"\n",

                "The hero of the one-act play at Hammerstein's Victoria\nvaudeville theater on that December evening was, it appeared, a\nwealthy young mine-owner in disguise.  He was working for the\n\"fake mine promoter\" because he loved the promoter's daughter\nwith a love that passed all understanding except that of the\ngirls in the gallery.  When the postal authorities were about to\narrest the promoter our young hero saved him by giving him a\nreal mine, and the ensuing kiss of the daughter ended the\nsuspense in which Mr. Wrenn and Nelly, Mrs. Arty and Tom had\nwatched the play from the sixth row of the balcony.\n",
                "Sighing happily, Nelly cried to the group:  \"Wasn't that grand?\nI got so excited!  Wasn't that young miner a dear?\"\n",
                "\"Awfully nice,\" said Mr. Wrenn.  \"And, gee! wasn't that great,\nthat office scene--with that safe and the rest of the\nstuff--just like you was in a real office.  But, say, they\nwouldn't have a copying-press in an office like that; those fake\nmine promoters send out such swell letters; they'd use carbon\ncopies and not muss the letters all up.\"\n",
                "\"By gosh, that's right!\" and Tom nodded his chin toward his\nright shoulder in approval.  Nelly cried,  \"That's so; they\nwould\";  while Mrs. Arty, not knowing what a copying-press was,\nappeared highly commendatory, and said nothing at all.\n",
                "During the moving pictures that followed, Mr. Wrenn felt\nproudly that he was taken seriously, though he had known\nthem but little over a month.  He followed up his conversational\nadvantage by leading the chorus in wondering, \"which one of them\ntwo actors the heroine was married to?\" and \"how much a week\nthey get for acting in that thing?\"  It was Tom who invited them\nto Miggleton's for coffee and fried oysters.  Mr. Wrenn was\nsilent for a while.  But as they were stamping through the\nrivulets of wheel-tracks that crisscrossed on a slushy\nstreet-crossing Mr. Wrenn regained his advantage by crying,\n\"Say, don't you think that play 'd have been better if the\npromoter 'd had an awful grouch on the young miner and 'd had to\ncrawfish when the miner saved him?\"\n",
                "\"Why, yes; it would!\" Nelly glowed at him.\n",
                "\"Wouldn't wonder if it would,\" agreed Tom, kicking the December\nslush off his feet and patting Mr. Wrenn's back.\n",
                "\"Well, look here,\" said Mr. Wrenn, as they left Broadway, with\nits crowds betokening the approach of Christmas, and stamped to\nthe quieter side of Forty-second, \"why wouldn't this make a\nslick play: say there's an awfully rich old guy; say he's a\nrailway president or something, d' you see?  Well, he's got a\nsecretary there in the office--on the stage, see?  The scene is\nhis office.  Well, this guy's--the rich old guy's--daughter\ncomes in and says she's married to a poor man and she won't tell\nhis name, but she wants some money from her dad.  You see, her\ndad's been planning for her to marry a marquise or some kind of\na lord, and he's sore as can be, and he won't listen to her, and\nhe just cusses her out something fierce, see?  Course he doesn't\nreally cuss, but he's awful sore; and she tells him didn't he\nmarry her mother when he was a poor young man; but he won't\nlisten.  Then the secretary butts in--my idea is he's been kind\nof keeping in the background, see--and _he's_ the daughter's\nhusband all the while, see?  and he tells the old codger how\nhe's got some of his--some of the old fellow's--papers that give\nit away how he done something that was crooked--some kind of\ndeal--rebates and stuff, see how I mean?--and the secretary's\ngoing to spring this stuff on the newspapers if the old man\ndon't come through and forgive them; so of course the president\nhas to forgive them, see?\"\n",
                "\"You mean the secretary was the daughter's husband all along,\nand he heard what the president said right there?\" Nelly panted,\nstopping outside Miggleton's, in the light from the\noyster-filled window.\n",
                "\"Yes; and he heard it all.\"\n",
                "\"Why, I think that's just a _fine_ idea,\" declared Nelly, as they\nentered the restaurant.  Though her little manner of dignity and\neven restraint was evident as ever, she seemed keenly joyous\nover his genius.\n",
                "\"Say, that's a corking idea for a play, Wrenn,\" exclaimed Tom,\nat their table, gallantly removing the ladies' wraps.\n",
                "\"It surely is,\" agreed Mrs. Arty.\n",
                "\"Why don't you write it?\" asked Nelly.\n",
                "\"Aw--I couldn't write it!\"\n",
                "\"Why, sure you could, Bill,\" insisted Tom.  \"Straight; you\nought to write it.  (Hey, waiter!  Four fries and coffee!)\nYou ought to write it.  Why, it's a wonder; it 'd make a dev--\n'Scuse me, ladies.  It'd make a howling hit.  You might make a\nlot of money out of it.\"\n",
                "The renewed warmth of their wet feet on the red-tile floor, the\nscent of fried oysters, the din of \"Any Little Girl\" on the\npiano, these added color to this moment of Mr. Wrenn's great\nresolve.  The four stared at one another excitedly.  Mr. Wrenn's\neyelids fluttered.  Tom brought his hand down on the table with\na soft flat \"plob\" and declared:  \"Say, there might be a lot\nof money in it.  Why, I've heard that Harry Smith--writes the\nwords for these musical comedies--makes a _mint_ of money.\"\n",
                "\"Mr. Poppins ought to help you in it--he's seen such a lot of\nplays,\" Mrs. Arty anxiously advised.\n",
                "\"That's a good idea,\" said Mr. Wrenn.  It had, apparently, been\nordained that he was to write it.  They were now settling\nimportant details.  So when Nelly cried, \"I think it's just a\nfine idea; I knew you had lots of imagination,\" Tom interrupted\nher with:\n",
                "\"No; you write it, Bill.  I'll help you all I can, of course....\nTell you what you ought to do: get hold of Teddem--he's had a\nlot of stage experience; he'd help you about seeing the managers.\nThat 'd be the hard part--you can write it, all right, but you'd\nhave to get next to the guys on the inside, and Teddem--Say,\nyou cer_tain_ly ought to write this thing, Bill.  Might make a lot\nof money.\"\n",
                "\"Oh, a lot!\" breathed Nelly.\n",
                "\"Heard about a fellow,\" continued Tom--\" fellow named Gene\nWolf, I think it was--that was so broke he was sleeping in\nBryant Park, and he made a _hundred thousand dollars_ on his\nfirst play--or, no; tell you how it was: he sold it outright for\nten thousand--something like that, anyway.  I got that right\nfrom a fellow that's met him.\"\n",
                "\"Still, an author's got to go to college and stuff like that.\"\nMr. Wrenn spoke as though he would be pleased to have the\nobjection overruled at once, which it was with a universal:\n",
                "\"Oh, rats!\"\n",
                "Crunching oysters in a brown jacket of flour, whose every lump\nwas a crisp delight, hearing his genius lauded and himself\ncalled Bill thrice in a quarter-hour, Mr. Wrenn was beatified.\nHe asked the waiter for some paper, and while the four hotly\ndiscussed things which \"it would be slick to have the\npresident's daughter do\" he drew up a list of characters on a\nsheet of paper he still keeps.  It is headed, \"Miggleton's\nForty-second Street Branch.\"  At the bottom appear numerous\nscribblings of the name Nelly.\n",
                "{the full page is covered with doodling as well}\n",

                "He said, hastily; \"I always liked that name.  I--I had an aunt\nnamed that!\"\n",
                "\"Oh--\" started Nelly.\n",
                "\"She was fine to me when I was a kid, \"Mr. Wrenn added, trying\nto remember whether it was right to lie when in such need.\n",

                "\"Nope; Nelly's an elegant name--an _elegant_ name.\"\n",
                "He walked with Nelly behind the others, along Forty-second\nStreet.  To the outsider's eye he was a small respectable clerk,\nslightly stooped, with a polite mustache and the dignity that\ncomes from knowing well a narrow world; wearing an overcoat too\nlight for winter; too busily edging out of the way of people and\nguiding the nice girl beside him into clear spaces by\ndiffidently touching her elbow, too pettily busy to cast a\nglance out of the crowd and spy the passing poet or king, or the\niron night sky.  He was as undistinguishable a bit of the\nevening street life as any of the file of street-cars slashing\nthrough the wet snow.  Yet, he was the chivalrous squire to the\ngreatest lady of all his realm; he was a society author, and a\nman of great prospective wealth and power over mankind!\n",
                "\"Say, we'll have the grandest dinner you ever saw if I get away\nwith the play,\" he was saying.  \"Will you come, Miss Nelly?\"\n",
                "\"Indeed I will!  Oh, you sha'n't leave me out!  Wasn't I there when--\"\n",
                "\"Indeed you were!  Oh, we'll have a reg'lar feast at the\nAstor--artichokes and truffles and all sorts of stuff....\nWould--would you like it if I sold the play?\"\n",

                "\"I'd buy the business and make Rabin manager--the Souvenir Company.\n",
                "So he came to relate all those intimacies of The Job; and he was\noverwhelmed at the ease with which she \"got onto old Goglefogle.\"\n",
                "His preparations for writing the play were elaborate.\n",
                "He paced Tom's room till twelve-thirty, consulting as to whether\nhe had to plan the stage-setting; smoking cigarettes in\nattitudes on chair arms.  Next morning in the office he made\nnumerous plans of the setting on waste half-sheets of paper.\nAt noon he was telephoning at Tom regarding the question of\nwhether there ought to be one desk or two on the stage.\n",
                "He skipped the evening meal at Mrs. Arty's, dining with literary\npensiveness at the Armenian, for he had subtle problems to\nmeditate.  He bought a dollar fountain-pen, which had large\ngold-like bands and a rather scratchy pen-point, and a box of\nfairly large sheets of paper.  Pressing his literary impedimenta\ntenderly under his arm, he attended four moving-picture and\nvaudeville theaters.  By eleven he had seen three more one-act\nplays and a dramatic playlet.\n",
                "He slipped by the parlor door at Mrs. Arty's.\n",
                "His room was quiet.  The lamplight on the delicately green walls\nwas like that of a regular author's den, he was quite sure.  He\nhappily tested the fountain-pen by writing the names Nelly and\nWilliam Wrenn on a bit of wrapping-paper (which he guiltily\nburned in an ash-tray); washed his face with water which he let\nrun for a minute to cool; sat down before his table with a grunt\nof content; went back and washed his hands; fiercely threw off\nthe bourgeois encumbrances of coat and collar; sat down again;\ngot up to straighten a picture; picked up his pen; laid it down,\nand glowed as he thought of Nelly, slumbering there, near at\nhand, her exquisite cheek nestling silkenly against her arm,\nperhaps, and her white dreams--\n",

Setting up his box stage, he glued a pill-box and a\nmatch-box on the floor--the side of the box it had always been\ntill now--and there he had the mahogany desks.

                "Breakfast at Mrs. Arty's was always an inspiration.  In contrast\nto the lonely dingy meal at the Hustler Dairy Lunch of his Zapp\ndays, he sat next to a trimly shirtwaisted Nelly, fresh and\nenthusiastic after nine hours' sleep.  So much for ordinary\ndays.  But Sunday morning--that was paradise!  The oil-stove\nglowed and purred like a large tin pussy cat; it toasted their\nlegs into dreamy comfort, while they methodically stuffed\nthemselves with toast and waffles and coffee.  Nelly and he\nalways felt gently superior to Tom Poppins, who would be\na-sleeping late, as they talked of the joy of not having to go\nto the office, of approaching Christmas, and of the superiority\nof Upton's Grove and Parthenon.\n",
                "This morning was to be Mr. Wrenn's first attendance at church\nwith Nelly.  The previous time they had planned to go, Mr. Wrenn\nhad spent Sunday morning in unreligious fervor at the Chelsea\nDental Parlors with a young man in a white jacket instead of at\nchurch with Nelly.\n",
                "This was also the first time that he had attended a church\nservice in nine years, except for mass at St. Patrick's, which\nhe regarded not as church, but as beauty.  He felt tremendously\nreformed, set upon new paths of virtue and achievement.  He\nthought slightingly of those lonely bachelors, Morton and\nMittyford, Ph. D.  They just didn't know what it meant to a\nfellow to be going to church with a girl like Miss Nelly, he\nreflected, as he re brushed his hair after breakfast.\n",
                "He walked proudly beside her, and made much of the gentility of\nentering the church, as one of the well-to-do and intensely\nbathed congregation.  He even bowed to an almost painfully\nwashed and brushed young usher with gold-rimmed eye-glasses.\nHe thought scornfully of his salad days, when he had bowed to\nthe Brass-button Man at the Nickelorion.\n",
                "The church interior was as comfortable as Sunday-morning toast\nand marmalade--half a block of red carpet in the aisles; shiny\nsolid-oak pews, gorgeous stained-glass windows, and a general\npolite creaking of ladies' best stays and gentlemen's stiff\nshirt-bosoms, and an odor of the best cologne and moth-balls.\n",
                "It lacked but six days till Christmas.  Mr. Wrenn's heart was a\nlittle garden, and his eyes were moist, and he peeped tenderly\nat Nelly as he saw the holly and ivy and the frosted Christmas\nmottoes, \"Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men,\" and the rest, that\nbrightened the spaces between windows.\n",
                "Christmas--happy homes--laughter....  Since, as a boy, he had\nattended the Christmas festivities of the Old Church\nSunday-school at Parthenon, and got highly colored candy in a\nnet bag, his holidays had been celebrated by buying himself plum\npudding at lonely Christmas dinners at large cheap restaurants,\nwhere there was no one to wish him \"Merry Christmas\" except\nhis waiter, whom he would quite probably never see again, nor\never wish to see.\n",
                "But this Christmas--he surprised himself and Nelly suddenly by\nhotly thrusting out his hand and touching her sleeve with the\nsearching finger-tips of a child comforted from night fears.\n",
                "During the sermon he had an idea.  What was it Nelly had told\nhim about \"Peter Pan\"?  Oh yes; somebody in it had said  \"Do you\nbelieve in fairies?\" _Say_, why wouldn't it be great to have the\nmillionaire's daughter say to her father, \"Do you believe in love?\"\n",
                "\"Gee, _I_ believe in love!\" he yearned to himself, as he felt\nNelly's arm unconsciously touch his.\n",
                "Tom Poppins had Horatio Hood Teddem in that afternoon for a hot\ntoddy.  Horatio looked very boyish, very confiding, and borrowed\nfive dollars from Mr. Wrenn almost painlessly, so absorbed was\nMr. Wrenn in learning from Horatio how to sell a play.  To know\nthe address of the firm of Wendelbaum & Schirtz, play-brokers,\nlocated in a Broadway theater building, seemed next door to\nknowing a Broadway manager.\n",
                "When Horatio had gone Tom presented an idea which he had\nponderously conceived during his Sunday noon-hour at the\ncigar-store.\n",
                "\"Why not have three of us--say me and you and Mrs. Arty--talk\nthe play, just like we was acting it?\"\n",
                "He enthusiastically forced the plan on Mr. Wrenn.  He pounded\ndown-stairs and brought up Mrs. Arty.  He dashed about the room,\nshouting directions.  He dragged out his bureau for the\nrailroad-president's desk, and a table for the secretary, and,\nafter some consideration and much rubbing of his chin, with two\nslams and a bang he converted his hard green Morris-chair into\nan office safe.\n",
                "The play was on.  Mr. T. Poppins, in the role of the president,\nentered, with a stern high expression on his face, threw a \"Good\nmorning, Thorne,\" at Wrenn, his secretary, and peeled off his gloves.\n(Mr. Wrenn noted the gloves; they were a Touch.)\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn approached diffidently, his face expressionless, lest\nMrs. Arty laugh at him.  \"Here--\n",
                "\"Say, what do you think would be a good way for the secretary to\ntell the crowd that the other guy is the president?  Say, how\nabout this:  `The vice-president of the railway would like to\nhave you sign these, sir, as president'?\"\n",
                "\"That's fine!\" exclaimed Mrs. Arty, whose satin dress was\ncarefully spread over her swelling knees, as she sat in the oak\nrocker, like a cheerful bronze monument to Sunday propriety.\n\"But don't you think he'd say, `when it's convenient to you, sir'?\"\n",
                "\"Gee, that's dandy!\"\n",
                "The play was on.\n",
                "It ended at seven.  Mr. Wrenn took but fifteen minutes for\nSunday supper, and wrote till one of the morning, finishing the\nfirst draft of his manuscript.\n",
                "Revision was delightful, for it demanded many conferences with\nNelly, sitting at the parlor table, with shoulders\nconfidentially touching.  They were the more intimate because\nTom had invited Mr. Wrenn, Nelly, and Mrs. Arty to the Grand\nChristmas Eve Ball of the Cigar-Makers' Union at Melpomene Hall.\nNelly asked of Mr. Wrenn, almost as urgently as of Mrs. Arty,\nwhether she should wear her new white mull or her older\nrose-colored China silk.\n",
                "Two days before Christmas he timidly turned over the play for\ntyping to a haughty public stenographer who looked like Lee\nTheresa Zapp.  She yawned at him when he begged her to be\ncareful of the manuscript.  The gloriously pink-bound and\nred-underlined typed manuscript of the play was mailed to\nMessrs.  Wendelbaum & Schirtz, play-brokers, at 6.15 P.M.,\nChristmas Eve.\n",
                "The four walked down Sixth Avenue to the Cigar-Makers' Ball.\nThey made an Indian file through the Christmas shopping crowds,\nand stopped frequently and noisily before the street-booths'\nglamour of tinsel and teddy-bears.  They shrieked all with one\nrotund mad laughter as Tom Poppins capered over and bought for\nseven cents a pink bisque doll, which he pinned to the lapel of\nhis plaid overcoat.  They drank hot chocolate at the Olympic\nConfectionery Store, pretending to each other that they were\nshivering with cold.\n",
                "It was here that Nelly reached up and patted Mr. Wrenn's\npale-blue tie into better lines.  In her hair was the scent\nwhich he had come to identify as hers.  Her white furs brushed\nagainst his overcoat.\n",
                "The cigar-makers, with seven of them in full evening-dress and\ntwo in dinner-coats, were already dancing on the waxy floor of\nMelpomene Hall when they arrived.  A full orchestra was pounding\nand scraping itself into an hysteria of merriment on the\nplatform under the red stucco-fronted balcony, and at the bar\nbehind the balcony there was a spirit of beer and revelry by night.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn embarrassedly passed large groups of pretty girls.\nHe felt very light and insecure in his new gun-metal-finish\npumps now that he had taken off his rubbers and essayed the\nslippery floor.  He tried desperately not to use his handkerchief\ntoo conspicuously, though he had a cold.\n",
                "It was not till the choosing of partners for the next dance,\nwhen Tom Poppins stood up beside Nelly, their arms swaying a\nlittle, their feet tapping, that Mr. Wrenn quite got the fact\nthat he could not dance.\n",
                "He had casually said to the others, a week before, that he knew\nonly the square dances which, as a boy, he had learned at\nparties at Parthenon.  But they had reassured him:  \"Oh, come\non--we'll teach you how to dance at the ball--it won't be formal.\nBesides, we'll give you some lessons before we go.\"\nPlaywriting and playing Five Hundred had prevented their giving\nhim the lessons.  So he now sat terrified as a two-step began\nand he saw what seemed to be thousands of glittering youths and\nmaidens whirling deftly in a most involved course, getting\nthemselves past each other in a way which he was sure he could\nnever imitate.  The orchestra yearned over music as rich and\nsmooth as milk chocolate, which made him intensely lonely for\nNelly, though she was only across the room from him.\n",
                "Tom Poppins immediately introduced Nelly to a facetious cigar\nsalesman, who introduced her to three of the beaux in evening\nclothes, while Tom led out Mrs. Arty.  Mr. Wrenn, sitting in a\nrow of persons who were not at all interested in his sorrows,\nglowered out across the hall, and wished, oh! so bitterly, to\nflee home.  Nelly came up, glowing, laughing, with\nblack-mustached and pearl-waistcoated men, and introduced him to\nthem, but he glanced at them disapprovingly; and always she was\ncarried off to dance again.\n",
                "She found and hopefully introduced to Mr. Wrenn a wallflower who\ncame from Yonkers and had never heard of Tom Poppins or\naeroplanes or Oxford or any other topic upon which Mr. Wrenn\nuneasily tried to discourse as he watched Nelly waltz and smile\nup at her partners.  Presently the two sat silent.  The wallflower\nexcused herself and went back to her mama from Yonkers.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn sat sulking, hating his friends for having brought\nhim, hating the sweetness of Nelly Croubel, and saying to\nhimself, \"Oh--_sure_--she dances with all those other men--me,\nI'm only the poor fool that talks to her when she's tired and\ntries to cheer her up.\"\n",
                "He did not answer when Tom came and told him a new story he had\njust heard in the barroom.\n",
                "Once Nelly landed beside him and bubblingly insisted on his\ncoming out and trying to learn to dance.  He brightened, but\nshyly remarked, \"Oh no, I don't think I'd better.\"  Just then the\nblackest-mustached and pearl-waistcoatedest of all the cigar\nsalesmen came begging for a dance, and she was gone, with only:\n\"Now get up your courage.  I'm going to _make_ you dance.\"\n",
                "At the intermission he watched her cross the floor with the\nhateful cigar salesman, slender in her tight crisp new white\nmull, flourishing her fan and talking with happy rapidity.\nShe sat down beside him.  He said nothing; he still stared out\nacross the glassy floor.  She peeped at him curiously several\ntimes, and made a low tapping with her fan on the side of her chair.\n",
                "She sighed a little.  Cautiously, but very casually, she said,\n\"Aren't you going to take me out for some refreshments, Mr. Wrenn?\"\n",
                "\"Oh sure--I'm good enough to buy refreshments for her!\" he said\nto himself.\n",
                "Poor Mr. Wrenn; he had not gone to enough parties in Parthenon,\nand he hadn't gone to any in New York.  At nearly forty he was\njust learning the drab sulkiness and churlishness and black\njealousy of the lover....  To her:  \"Why didn't you go out with\nthat guy with the black mustache?\"  He still stared straight ahead.\n",
                "She was big-eyed, a tear showing.  \"Why, Billy--\" was all she\nanswered.\n",
                "He clenched his hands to keep from bursting out with all the\npitiful tears which were surging in his eyes.  But he said nothing.\n",
                "\"Billy, what--\"\n",
                "He turned shyly around to her; his hand touched hers softly.\n",
                "\"Oh, I'm a beast,\" he said, rapidly, low, his undertone\ntrembling to her ears through the laughter of a group next to\nthem.  \"I didn't mean that, but I was--I felt like such a\nmutt--not being able to dance.  Oh, Nelly, I'm awfully sorry.\nYou know I didn't mean--_Come on!_ Let's go get something to eat!\"\n",
                "As they consumed ice-cream, fudge, doughnuts, and chicken\nsandwiches at the refreshment counter they were very intimate,\nresenting the presence of others.  Tom and Mrs. Arty joined\nthem.  Tom made Nelly light her first cigarette.  Mr. Wrenn\nadmired the shy way in which, taking the tiniest of puffs, she\nkept drawing out her cigarette with little pouts and nose\nwriggles and pretended sneezes, but he felt a lofty gladness\nwhen she threw it away after a minute, declaring that she'd\nnever smoke again, and that she was going to make all three of\nher companions stop smoking, \"now that she knew how horrid and\nsneezy it was, so there!\"\n",
                "With what he intended to be deep subtlety Mr. Wrenn drew her\naway to the barroom, and these two children, over two glasses of\nginger-ale, looked their innocent and rustic love so plainly\nthat Mrs. Arty and Tom sneaked away.  Nelly cut out a dance,\nwhich she had promised to a cigar-maker, and started homeward\nwith Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "\"Let's not take a car--I want some fresh air after that smoky\nplace,\" she said.  \"But it _was_ grand....  Let's walk up\nFifth Avenue.\"\n",
                "\"Fine....  Tired, Nelly?\"\n",
                "\"A little.\"\n",
                "He thought her voice somewhat chilly.\n",
                "\"Nelly--I'm so sorry--I didn't really have the chance to tell\nyou in there how sorry I was for the way I spoke to you.\nGee! it was fierce of me--but I felt--I couldn't dance, and--oh--\"\n",
                "No answer.\n",
                "\"And you did mind it, didn't you?\"\n",
                "\"Why, I didn't think you were so very nice about it--when I'd\ntried so hard to have you have a good time--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, Nelly, I'm so sorry--\"\n",
                "There was tragedy in his voice.  His shoulders, which he always\ntried to keep as straight as though they were in a vise when he\nwalked with her, were drooping.\n",
                "She touched his glove.  \"Oh don't, Billy; it's all right now.\nI understand.  Let's forget--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, you're too good to me!\"\n",
                "Silence.\n",
                "As they crossed Twenty-third on Fifth Avenue she took his arm.\nHe squeezed her hand.  Suddenly the world was all young and\nbeautiful and wonderful.  It was the first time in his life that\nhe had ever walked thus, with the arm of a girl for whom he\ncared cuddled in his.  He glanced down at her cheap white furs.\nSnowflakes, tremulous on the fur, were turned into diamond dust\nin the light from a street-lamp which showed as well a tiny\nplace where her collar had been torn and mended ever so\ncarefully.  Then, in a millionth of a second, he who had been a\nwanderer in the lonely gray regions of a detached man's heart\nknew the pity of love, all its emotion, and the infinite care\nfor the beloved that makes a man of a rusty sales-clerk.\nHe lifted a face of adoration to the misty wonder of the bare\ntrees, whose tracery of twigs filled Madison Square; to the\nMetropolitan Tower, with its vast upward stretch toward the\nruddy sky of the city's winter night.  All these mysteries he\nknew and sang.  What he _said_ was:\n",
                "\"Gee, those trees look like a reg'lar picture!...  The Tower\njust kind of fades away.  Don't it?\"\n",
                "\"Yes, it is pretty,\" she said, doubtfully, but with a pressure\nof his arm.\n",
                "Then they talked like a summer-time brook, planning that he was\nto buy a Christmas bough of evergreen, which she would smuggle\nto breakfast in the morning.  Through their chatter persisted\nthe new intimacy which had been born in the pain of their\nmisunderstanding.\n",
                "On January 10th the manuscript of \"The Millionaire's Daughter\"\nwas returned by play-brokers Wendelbaum & Schirtz with this letter:\n",
                "DEAR SIR,--We regret to say that we do not find play available.\nWe inclose our reader's report on the same.  Also inclose bill\nfor ten dollars for reading-fee, which kindly remit at early\nconvenience.\n",
                "He stood in the hall at Mrs. Arty's just before dinner.\nHe reread the letter and slowly opened the reader's report,\nwhich announced:\n",
                "\"Millionaire's Daughter.\"  One-act vlle.  Utterly impos.\nAmateurish to the limit.  Dialogue sounds like burlesque of\nLaura Jean Libbey.  Can it.\n",
                "Nelly was coming down-stairs.  He handed her the letter and\nreport, then tried to stick out his jaw.  She read them.  Her\nhand slipped into his.  He went quickly toward the basement and\nmade himself read the letter--though not the report--to the\ntableful.  He burned the manuscript of his play before going to\nbed.  The next morning he waded into The Job as he never had\nbefore.  He was gloomily certain that he would never get away\nfrom The Job.  But he thought of Nelly a hundred times a day and\nhoped that sometime, some spring night of a burning moon, he\nmight dare the great adventure and kiss her.  Istra--\nTheoretically, he remembered her as a great experience.\nBut what nebulous bodies these theories are!\n",
                "That slow but absolutely accurate Five-Hundred player, Mr.\nWilliam Wrenn, known as Billy, glanced triumphantly at Miss\nProudfoot, who was his partner against Mrs. Arty and James\nT. Duncan, the traveling-man, on that night of late February.\nHis was the last bid in the crucial hand of the rubber game.\nThe others waited respectfully.  Confidently, he bid \"Nine\non no trump.\"\n",

                "\"I'll make it.\"\n",
                "And he did.  He arose a victor.  There was no uneasiness, but\nrather all the social polish of Mrs. Arty's at its best, in his\nmanner, as he crossed to Mrs. Ebbitt's chair and asked:  \"How is\nMr. Ebbitt to-night?  Pretty rheumatic?\"  Miss Proudfoot offered\nhim a lime tablet, and he accepted it judicially.  \"I believe\nthese tablets are just about as good as Park & Tilford's,\" he\nsaid, cocking his head.  \"Say, Dunk, I'll match you to see who\nrushes a growler of beer.  Tom'll be here pretty soon--store\nought to be closed by now.  We'll have some ready for him.\"\n",
                "\"Right, Bill,\" agreed James T. Duncan.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn lost.  He departed, after secretively obtaining not\none, but two pitchers, in one of which he got a \"pint of dark\"\nand in the other a surprise.  He bawled upstairs to Nelly,\n\"Come on down, Nelly, can't you?  Got a growler of ice-cream\nsoda for the ladies!\"\n",
                "It is true that when Tom arrived and fell to conversational\nblows with James T. Duncan over the merits of a Tom Collins Mr.\nWrenn was not brilliant, for the reason that he took Tom Collins\nto be a man instead of the drink he really is.\n",
                "Yet, as they went up-stairs Miss Proudfoot said to Nelly:\n\"Mr. Wrenn is quiet, but I do think in some ways he's one of the\nnicest men I've seen in the house for years.  And he is so earnest.\nAnd I think he'll make a good pinochle player, besides Five Hundred.\"\n",

He was wondering if he'd want to see\nIstra at all.  He couldn't remember just how she looked.  Would\nhe like her?\n",
                "The great steamer swung side-to and was coaxed alongside the\nwharf.  Peering out between rows of crowding shoulders, Mr.\nWrenn coldly inspected the passengers lining the decks.  Istra\nwas not in sight.  Then he knew that he was wildly agitated\nabout her.  Suppose something had happened to her!\n",
                "The smallish man who had been edging into the crowd so politely\nsuddenly dashed to the group forming at the gang-plank and\npushed his way rudely into the front rank.  His elbow dug into\nthe proper waistcoat of a proper plump old gentleman, but he\ndidn't know it.  He stood grasping the rope rail of the plank,\ngazing goggle-eyed while the plank was lifted to the steamer's\ndeck and the long line of smiling and waving passengers\ndisembarked.  Then he saw her--tall, graceful, nonchalant,\nuninterested, in a smart check suit with a lively hat of black\nstraw, carrying a new Gladstone bag.\n",

Tom Poppins did not fail to bellow\n\"Bring on the dish-water,\" nor Miss Mary Proudfoot to cheep\ndemurely \"Don't y' knaow\" in a tone which would have been\nrecognized as fascinatingly English anywhere on the American\nstage.  Then the talk stopped dead as Istra Nash stood agaze in\nthe doorway--pale and intolerant, her red hair twisted high on\nher head, tall and slim and uncorseted in a gray tight-fitting\ngown.  Every head turned as on a pivot, first to Istra, then to\nMr. Wrenn.  He blushed and bowed as if he had been called on for\na speech, stumblingly arose, and said:  \"Uh--uh--uh--you met\nMrs. Ferrard, didn't you, Istra?  She'll introduce you to the rest.\"\n",
                "He sat down, wondering why the deuce he'd stood up, and\nunhappily realized that Nelly was examining Istra and himself\nwith cool hostility.  In a flurry he glowered at Istra as she\nnonchalantly sat down opposite him, beside Mrs. Arty, and\nincuriously unfolded her napkin.  He thought that in her\ncheerful face there was an expression of devilish amusement.\n",
                "He blushed.  He furiously buttered his bread as Mrs. Arty\nremarked to the assemblage:\n",
                "\"Ladies and gentlemen, I want you all to meet Miss Istra Nash.\nMiss Nash--you've met Mr. Wrenn; Miss Nelly Croubel, our baby;\nTom Poppins, the great Five-Hundred player; Mrs. Ebbitt, Mr.\nEbbitt, Miss Proudfoot.\"\n",
                "Istra Nash lifted her bowed eyes with what seemed shyness,\nhesitated, said \"Thank you\" in a clear voice with a precise\npronunciation, and returned to her soup, as though her pleasant\ncommunion with it had been unpleasantly interrupted.\n",
                "The others began talking and eating very fast and rather noisily.\nMiss Mary Proudfoot's thin voice pierced the clamor:\n",

How exquisite she looked, with her tired\nwhite face!\n",
                "As the soup-plates were being removed by Annie, the maid, with\nan elaborate confusion and a general passing of plates down the\nline, Istra Nash peered at the maid petulantly.  Mrs. Arty\nfrowned, then grew artificially pleasant and said:\n",
                "\"Miss Nash has just come back from Paris.  She's a regular\nEuropean traveler, just like Mr. Wrenn.\"\n",
                "Mrs. Samuel Ebbitt piped:  \"Mr. Ebbitt was to Europe.  In 1882.\"\n",
                "\"No 'twa'n't, Fannie; 'twas in 1881,\" complained Mr. Ebbitt.\n",
                "Miss Nash waited for the end of this interruption as though it\nwere a noise which merely had to be endured, like the Elevated.\n",
                "Twice she drew in her breath to speak, and the whole table laid\nits collective knife and fork down to listen.  All she said was:\n",
                "\"Oh, will you pardon me if I speak of it now, Mrs. Ferrard, but\nwould you mind letting me have my breakfast in my room\nto-morrow?  About nine?  Just something simple--a canteloupe\nand some shirred eggs and chocolate?\"\n",
                "\"Oh no; why, yes, certainly, \"mumbled Mrs. Arty, while the table\nheld its breaths and underneath them gasped:\n",

                "\"Miss Nash oughta be a good person for our picnics.  She's a\nregular shark for outdoor tramping.\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes, Mr. Wrenn and I tramped most all night in England one\ntime,\" said Istra, innocently.\n",

                "\"Yes,\" he mumbled.  \"Quite a long walk.\"\n",

                "\"No.\"\n",
                "Then they were all silent, and the rest of the dinner Mr. Wrenn\nalternately discussed Olympia Johns with Istra and picnics with\nNelly.  There was an undertone of pleading in his voice which\nmade Nelly glance at him and even become kind.  With quiet\ninsistence she dragged Istra into a discussion of rue de la Paix\nfashions which nearly united the shattered table and won Mr.\nWrenn's palpitating thankfulness.\n",
                "After dessert Istra slowly drew a plain gold cigarette-case from\na brocade bag of silvery gray.  She took out a match and a thin\nRussian cigarette, which she carefully lighted.  She sat smoking\nin one of her best attitudes, pointed elbows on the table,\ncoolly contemplating a huge picture called \"Hunting the Stag\"\non the wall behind Mr. Wrenn.\n",
                "Mrs. Arty snapped to the servant, \"Annie, bring me _my_ cigarettes.\"\nBut Mrs. Arty always was penitent when she had been nasty,\nand--though Istra did not at once seem to know that the\nlandlady _had_ been nasty--Mrs. Arty invited her up to the parlor\nfor after-dinner so cordially that Istra could but grant\n\"Perhaps I will,\" and she even went so far as to say, \"I think\nyou're all to be envied, having such a happy family.\"\n",
                "\"Yes, that's so,\" reflected Mrs. Arty.\n",
                "\"Yes,\" added Mr. Wrenn.\n",

                "They applauded.  They felt that she had been humorous.  She was\nagain and publicly invited up to the parlor, and she came,\nthough she said, rather shortly, that she didn't play Five\nHundred, but only bumblepuppy bridge, a variety of whist which\nMr. Wrenn instantly resolved to learn.  She reclined (\"reclined\"\nis perfectly accurate) on the red-leather couch, among the\npillows, and smoked two cigarettes, relapsing into \"No?\"'s for\nconversation.\n",
                "Mr. Wrenn said to himself, almost spitefully, as she snubbed\nNelly, \"Too good for us, is she?\"  But he couldn't keep away from\nher.  The realization that Istra was in the room made him forget\nmost of his melds at pinochle; and when Miss Proudfoot inquired\nhis opinion as to whether the coming picnic should be held on\nStaten island or the Palisades he said, vaguely, \"Yes, I guess\nthat would be better.\"\n",
                "For he was wanting to sit down beside Istra Nash, just be near her;\nhe _had_ to be!  So he ventured over and was instantly regarding\nall the rest as outsiders whom his wise comrade and himself\nwere studying.\n",

I've always lived in a house where\nthe folks didn't hardly know each other at all, except Mrs.\nZapp--she was the landlady--and I didn't like her very much.\nBut here Tom Poppins and Mrs. Arty and--the rest--they really\nlike folks, and they make it just like a home....

                "He stopped in horror.  He had nearly said \"in the lingery\ndepartment.\" He changed it to \"in the clothing department,\" and\nwent on, doubtfully:  \"Mr. Duncan is a traveling-man.  He's\naway on a trip.\"\n",
                "\"Which one do you play with?  So Nelly likes to--well, make\nb'lieve--'magine?\"\n",

                "\"Yes _ma'am_, you sure can!\" said broad Tom, all one pleased\nchuckle, poking out the two bags.\n",
                "Istra stopped beside the Five-Hundred table to smile in a lordly\nway down at Mrs. Arty and say, quite humanly:\n",

                "Nelly went up to bed early.  She was tired, she said.  He had no\nchance for a word with her.  He sat on the steps outside alone\na long time.  Sometimes he yearned for a sight of Istra's ivory\nface.  Sometimes, with a fierce compassion that longed to take\nthe burden from her, he pictured Nelly working all day in the\nrushing department store on which the fetid city summer would\nsoon descend.\n",
                "They did have their walk the next night, Istra and Mr. Wrenn,\nbut Istra kept the talk to laughing burlesques of their tramp in\nEngland.  Somehow--he couldn't tell exactly why--he couldn't\nseem to get in all the remarks he had inside him about how much\nhe had missed her.\n",
                "Wednesday--Thursday--Friday; he saw her only at one dinner, or\non the stairs, departing volubly with clever-looking men in\nevening clothes to taxis waiting before the house.\n",
                "Nelly was very pleasant; just that--pleasant.  She pleasantly\nsat as his partner at Five Hundred, and pleasantly declined to\ngo to the moving pictures with him.  She was getting more and\nmore tired, staying till seven at the store, preparing what she\ncalled \"special stunts\" for the summer white sale.  Friday\nevening he saw her soft fresh lips drooping sadly as she toiled\nup the front steps before dinner.  She went to bed at eight, at\nwhich time Istra was going out to dinner with a thin,\nhatchet-faced sarcastic-looking man in a Norfolk jacket and a\nfluffy black tie.  Mr. Wrenn resented the Norfolk jacket.  Of\ncourse, the kingly men in evening dress would be expected to\ntake Istra away from him, but a Norfolk jacket--He did not\ncall it that.  Though he had worn one in the fair village of\nAengusmere, it was still to him a \"coat with a belt.\"\n",
                "He thought of Nelly all evening.  He heard her--there on the\nsame floor with him--talking to Miss Proudfoot, who stood at\nNelly's door, three hours after she was supposed to be asleep.\n",
                "\"No,\" Nelly was saying with evidently fictitious cheerfulness,\n\"no, it was just a little headache....  It's much better.  I\nthink I can sleep now.  Thank you very much for coming.\"\n",
                "Nelly hadn't told Mr. Wrenn that she had a severe headache--she\nwho had once, a few weeks before, run to him with a cut in her\nsoft small finger, demanding that he bind it up....  He went\nslowly to bed.\n",
                "He had lain awake half an hour before his agony so overpowered\nhim that he flung out of bed.  He crouched low by the bed, like\na child, his legs curled under him, the wooden sideboard pressing\ninto his chest in one long line of hot pain, while he prayed:\n",
                "\"O God, O God, forgive me, forgive me, oh, forgive me!  Here I\nbeen forgetting Nelly (and I _love_ her) and comparing her with\nIstra and not appreciating her, and Nelly always so sweet to me\nand trusting me so--O God, keep me away from wickedness!\"\n",
                "He huddled there many minutes, praying, the scorching pressure\nof the bedside growing more painful.  All the while the\ncamp-fire he had shared with Istra was burning within his closed\neyes, and Istra was visibly lording it in a London flat filled\nwith clever people, and he was passionately aware that the line\nof her slim breast was like the lip of a shell; the line of her\npallid cheek, defined by her flame-colored hair, something\nutterly fine, something he could not express.\n",
                "\"Oh,\" he groaned, \"she is like that poetry stuff in Shakespeare\nthat's so hard to get....  I'll be extra nice to Nelly at the\npicnic Sunday....  Her trusting me so, and then me--O God,\nkeep me away from wickedness!\"\n",
                "As he was going out Saturday morning he found a note from Istra\nwaiting in the hall on the hat-rack:\n",
                "Do you want to play with poor Istra tomorrow Sat.  afternoon and\nperhaps evening, Mouse?  You have Saturday afternoon off, don't\nyou?  Leave me a note if you can call for me at 1.30.\n                                                      I. N.\n",
                "He didn't have Saturday afternoon off, but he said he did in his\nnote, and at one-thirty he appeared at her door in a new spring\nsuit (purchased on Tuesday), a new spring hat, very fuzzy and\ngay (purchased Saturday noon), and the walking-stick he had\nbought on Tottenham Court Road, but decently concealed from the\nboarding-house.\n",
                "Istra took him to what she called a \"futurist play.\" She\nexplained it all to him several times, and she stood him tea and\nmuffins, and recalled Mrs. Cattermole's establishment with full\nattention to Mrs. Cattermole's bulbous but earnest nose.  They\ndined at the Brevoort, and were back at nine-thirty; for, said\nIstra, she was \"just a bit tired, Mouse.\"\n",
                "They stood at the door of Istra's room.  Istra said,  \"You may\ncome in--just for a minute.\"\n",
                "It was the first time he had even peeped into her room in New\nYork.  The old shyness was on him, and he glanced back.\n",
                "Nelly was just coming up-stairs, staring at him where he stood\ninside the door, her lips apart with amazement.\n",
                "Ladies distinctly did not entertain in their rooms at Mrs. Arty's.\n",
                "He wanted to rush out, to explain, to invite her in, to--to--\nHe stuttered in his thought, and by now Nelly had hastened past,\nher face turned from them.\n",
                "Uneasily he tilted on the front of a cane-seated rocking-chair,\nglaring at a pile of books before one of Istra's trunks.  Istra\nsat on the bedside nursing her knee.  She burst out:\n",
                "\"O Mouse dear, I'm so bored by everybody--every sort of\neverybody....  Of course I don't mean you; you're a good pal....\nOh--Paris is _too_ complex--especially when you can't quite get\nthe nasal vowels--and New York is too youthful and earnest; and\nDos Puentes, California, will be plain hell....  And all my\nlittle parties--I start out on them happily, always, as naive as\na kiddy going to a birthday party, and then I get there and find\nI can't even dance square dances, as the kiddy does, and go\nhome--Oh damn it, damn it, damn it!  Am I shocking you?  Well,\nwhat do I care if I shock everybody!\"\n",
                "Her slim pliant length was flung out along the bed, and she was\ncrying.  Her beautiful hands clutched the corners of a pillow\nbitterly.\n",
                "He crept over to the bed, patting her shoulder, slowly and\nregularly, too frightened of her mood even to want to kiss her.\n",
                "She looked up, laughing tearfully.  \"Please say, `There, there,\nthere; don't cry.'  It always goes with pats for weepy girls, you\nknow....  O Mouse, you will be good to some woman some day.\"\n",
                "Her long strong arms reached up and drew him down.  It was his\nhead that rested on her shoulder.  It seemed to both of them\nthat it was he who was to be petted, not she.  He pressed his\ncheek against the comforting hollow of her curving shoulder and\nrested there, abandoned to a forlorn and growing happiness, the\nhappiness of getting so far outside of his tight world of\nWrennishness that he could give comfort and take comfort with no\nprim worried thoughts of Wrenn.\n",
                "Istra murmured:  \"Perhaps that's what I need--some one to need\nme.  Only--\"  She stroked his hair.  \"Now you must go, dear.\"\n",
                "\"You--It's better now?  I'm afraid I ain't helped you much.\nIt's kinda t' other way round.\"\n",
                "\"Oh yes, indeed, it's all right now!  Just nerves.  Nothing more.\nNow, good night.\"\n",
                "\"Please, won't you come to the picnic to-morrow?  It's--\"\n",
                "\"No.  Sorry, but can't possibly.\"\n",
                "\"Please think it over.\"\n",
                "\"No, no, no, no, dear!  You go and forget me and enjoy yourself\nand be good to your pink-face--Nelly, isn't it?  She seems to be\nterribly nice, and I know you two will have a good party.  You\nmust forget me.  I'm just a teacher of playing games who hasn't\nbeen successful at any game whatever.  Not that it matters.\nI don't care.  I don't, really.  Now, good night.\"\n"

                "They had picnic dinner early up there on the Palisades:\n",
                "Nelly and Mr. Wrenn, Mrs. Arty and Tom, Miss Proudfoot and Mrs.\nSamuel Ebbitt, the last of whom kept ejaculating:  \"Well! I\nain't run off like this in ten years!\"  They squatted about a\nred-cotton table-cloth spread on a rock, broadly discussing the\nsandwiches and cold chicken and lemonade and stuffed olives, and\nlaughing almost to a point of distress over Tom's accusation\nthat Miss Proudfoot had secreted about her person a bottle of\nrye whisky.\n",
                "Nelly was very pleasant to Mr. Wrenn, but she called him neither\nBilly nor anything else, and mostly she talked to Miss Proudfoot,\nsmiling at him, but saying nothing when he managed to get out a\njest about Mrs. Arty's chewing-gum.  When he moved to her side\nwith a wooden plate of cream-cheese sandwiches (which Tom\nhumorously termed \"cold-cream wafers\") Mr. Wrenn started to\nexplain how he had come to enter Istra's room.\n",
                "\"Why shouldn't you?\" Nelly asked, curtly, and turned to Miss\nProudfoot.\n",
                "\"She doesn't seem to care much,\" he reflected, relieved and\nstabbed in his humble vanity and reattracted to Nelly, all at\nonce.  He was anxious about her opinion of Istra and her opinion\nof himself, and slightly defiant, as she continued to regard him\nas a respectable person whose name she couldn't exactly\nremember.\n",
                "Hadn't he the right to love Istra if he wanted to? he desired\nto know of himself.  Besides, what had he _done?_  Just gone out\nwalking with his English hotel acquaintance Istra!  He hadn't\nbeen in her room but just a few minutes.  Fine reason that was\nfor Nelly to act like a blooming iceberg!  Besides, it wasn't\nas if he were engaged to Nelly, or anything like that.\nBesides, of course Istra would never care for him.  There were\nseveral other besideses with which he harrowed himself while\ntrying to appear picnically agreeable.  He was getting very much\nconfused, and was slightly abrupt as he said to Nelly, \"Let's\nwalk over to that high rock on the edge.\"\n",
                "A dusky afterglow filled the sky before them as they silently\ntrudged to the rock and from the top of the sheer cliff\ncontemplated the smooth and steely-gray Hudson below.  Nelly\nsqueaked her fear at the drop and clutched his arm, but suddenly\nlet go and drew back without his aid.\n",
                "He groaned within, \"I haven't the right to help her.\"  He took her\narm as she hesitatingly climbed from the rock down to the ground.\n",
                "She jerked it free, curtly saying,  \"No, thank you.\"\n",
                "She was repentant in a moment, and, cheerfully:\n",
                "\"Miss Nash took me in her room yesterday and showed me her\nthings.  My, she's got such be-_yoo_-ti-ful jewels!  La V'lieres\nand pearls and a swell amethyst brooch.  My!  She told me all\nabout how the girls used to study in Paris, and how sorry she\nwould be to go back to California and keep house.\"\n",
                "\"Keep house?\"\n",
                "Nelly let him suffer for a moment before she relieved him with,\n\"For her father.\"\n",
                "\"Oh....  Did she say she was going back to California soon?\"\n",
                "\"Not till the end of the summer, maybe.\"\n",
                "\"Oh....  Oh, Nelly--\"\n",
                "For the first time that day he was perfectly sincere.  He was\ntrying to confide in her.  But the shame of having emotions was\non him.  He got no farther.\n",
                "To his amazement, Nelly mused,  \"She is very nice.\"\n",
                "He tried hard to be gallant.  \"Yes, she is interesting, but of\ncourse she ain't anywheres near as nice as you are, Nelly, be--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, don't, Billy!\"\n",
                "The quick agony in her voice almost set them both weeping.  The\nshared sorrow of separation drew them together for a moment.\nThen she started off, with short swift steps, and he tagged\nafter.  He found little to say.  He tried to comment on the\nriver.  He remarked that the apartment-houses across in New York\nwere bright in the sunset; that, in fact, the upper windows\nlooked \"like there was a fire in there.\" Her sole comment was \"Yes.\"\n",
                "When they rejoined the crowd he was surprised to hear her\ntalking volubly to Miss Proudfoot.  He rejoiced that she was\n\"game,\" but he did not rejoice long.  For a frightened feeling\nthat he had to hurry home and see Istra at once was turning him\nweak and cold.  He didn't want to see her; she was intruding;\nbut he had to go--go at once; and the agony held him all the way\nhome, while he was mechanically playing the part of stern\nreformer and agreeing with Tom Poppins that the horrors of the\nrecent Triangle shirt-waist-factory fire showed that \"something\noughta be done--something sure oughta be.\"\n",
                "He trembled on the ferry till Nelly, with a burst of motherly\ntenderness in her young voice, suddenly asked:  \"Why, you're\nshivering dreadfully!  Did you get a chill?\"\n",
                "Naturally, he wanted the credit of being known as an invalid,\nand pitied and nursed, but he reluctantly smiled and said, \"Oh\nno, it ain't anything at all.\"\n",
                "Then Istra called him again, and he fumed over the slowness of\ntheir landing.\n",
                "And, at home, Istra was out.\n",
                "He went resolutely down and found Nelly alone, sitting on a\nround pale-yellow straw mat on the steps.\n",
                "He sat by her.  He was very quiet; not at all the jovial young\nman of the picnic properly following the boarding-house-district\nrule that males should be jocular and show their appreciation of\nthe ladies by \"kidding them.\"  And he spoke with a quiet\ngraciousness that was almost courtly, with a note of weariness\nand spiritual experience such as seldom comes into the\nboarding-houses, to slay joy and bring wisdom and give words shyness.\n",
                "He had, as he sat down, intended to ask her to go with him to a\nmoving-picture show.  But inspiration was on him.  He merely sat\nand talked.\n",
                "When Mr. Wrenn returned from the office, two evenings later, he\nfound this note awaiting him:\n",
                "DEAR MOUSE,--Friend has asked me to join her in studio & have\nbeat it.  Sorry not see you & say good-by.  Come see me\nsometime--phone before and see if I'm in--Spring xxx--address xx\nSouth Washington Sq.  In haste,                        ISTRA.\n",
                "He spent the evening in not going to the studio.  Several times\nhe broke away from a pinochle game to rush upstairs and see if\nthe note was as chilly as he remembered.  It always was.\n",
                "Then for a week he awaited a more definite invitation from her,\nwhich did not come.  He was uneasily polite to Nelly these days,\nand tremulously appreciative of her gentleness.  He wanted to\nbrood, but he did not take to his old habit of long solitary\nwalks.  Every afternoon he planned one for the evening; every\nevening found that he \"wanted to be around with folks.\"\n",
                "He had a sort of youthful defiant despair, so he jested much at\nthe card-table, by way of practising his new game of keeping\npeople from knowing what he was thinking.  He took sophisticated\npleasure in noting that Mrs. Arty no longer condescended to him.\nHe managed to imitate Tom's writing on a card which he left with\na bunch of jonquils in Nelly's room, and nearly persuaded even\nTom himself that Tom was the donor.  Probably because he didn't\nmuch care what happened he was able to force Mr. Mortimer R.\nGuilfogle to raise his salary to twenty-three dollars a week.\nMr. Guilfogle went out of his way to admit that the letters to\nthe Southern trade had been \"a first-rate stunt, son.\"\n",
                "John Henson, the head of the Souvenir Company's manufacturing\ndepartment, invited Mr. Wrenn home to dinner, and the account of\nthe cattle-boat was much admired by Mrs. Henson and the three\nyoung Hensons.\n",
                "A few days later, in mid-June, there was an unusually cheerful\ndinner at the boarding-house.  Nelly turned to Mr. Wrenn--yes,\nhe was quite sure about it; she was speaking exclusively to him,\nwith a lengthy and most merry account of the manner in which the\nfloor superintendent had \"called down\" the unkindest of the\naislesmen.\n",
                "He longed to give his whole self in his answer, to be in the\nabsolute community of thought that lovers know.  But the image\nof Istra was behind his chair.  Istra--he had to see her--now,\nthis evening.  He rushed out to the corner drug-store and\nreached her by telephone.\n",
                "Yes-s, admitted Istra, a little grudgingly, she was going to be\nat the studio that evening, though she--well, there was going to\nbe a little party--some friends--but--yes, she'd be glad to have\nhim come.\n",
                "Grimly, Mr. Wrenn set out for Washington Square.\n",
                "Since this scientific treatise has so exhaustively examined Mr.\nWrenn's reactions toward the esthetic, one need give but three\nof his impressions of the studio and people he found on\nWashington Square--namely:\n",
                "(a) That the big room was bare, ill kept, and not comparable to\nthe red-plush splendor of Mrs. Arty's, for all its pretension to\nsuperiority.  Why, a lot of the pictures weren't framed!  And you\nshould have seen the giltness and fruit-borderness of the frames\nat Mrs. Arty's!\n",
                "(b) That the people were brothers-in-talk to the inmates of the\nflat on Great James Street, London, only far less, and friendly.\n",
                "(c) That Mr. Wrenn was now a man of friends, and if the\n\"blooming Bohemians,\" as he called them, didn't like him they\nwere permitted to go to the dickens.\n",
                "Istra was always across the room from him somehow.  He found\nhimself glad.  It made their parting definite.\n",
                "He was going back to his own people, he was deciding.\n",
                "As he rose with elaborate boarding-house apologies to the room\nat large for going, and a cheerful but not intimate \"Good night\"\nto Istra, she followed him to the door and into the dark long\nhallway without.\n",
                "\"Good night, Mouse dear.  I'm glad you got a chance to talk to\nthe Silver Girl.  But was Mr. Hargis rude to you?  I heard him\ntalking Single Tax--or was it Matisse?--and he's usually rude\nwhen he talks about them.\"\n",
                "\"No.  He was all right.\"\n",

                "\"N-no--\"\n",
                "\"Matisse--the guy you just spoke about--and these artists here\ntonight in bobtail dress-suits--I wouldn't know when to wear one\nof them things, and when a swallow-tail--if I had one, even--or\nwhen a Prince Albert or--\"\n",
                "\"Oh, not a Prince Albert, Mouse dear.  Say, a frock-coat.\"\n",
                "\"Sure.  That's what I mean.  It's like that Matisse guy.  I\ndon't know about none of the things you're interested in.  While\nyou've been away from Mrs. Arty's--Lord, I've missed you so!  But\nwhen I try to train with your bunch, or when you spring Matisse\"\n(he seemed peculiarly to resent the unfortunate French artist)\n\"on me I sort of get onto myself--and now it ain't like it was\nin England; I've got a bunch of my own I can chase around with.\nAnyway, I got onto myself tonight.  I s'pose it's partly because\nI been thinking you didn't care much for _my_ friends.\"\n",
                "\"But, Mouse dear, all this isn't news to me.  Surely you, who've\ngipsied with me, aren't going to be so obvious, so banal, as to\nblame _me_ because you've cared for me, are you, child?\"\n",
                "\"Oh no, no, no! I didn't mean to do that.  I just wanted--oh,\ngee!  I dunno--well, I wanted to have things between us definite.\"\n",
                "\"I do understand.  You're quite right.  And now we're just\nfriends, aren't we?\"\n",
                "\"Yes.\"\n",
                "\"Then good-by.  And sometime when I'm back in New York--I'm\ngoing to California in a few days--I think I'll be able to get\nback here--I certainly hope so--though of course I'll have to\nkeep house for friend father for a while, and maybe I'll marry\nmyself with a local magnate in desperation--but, as I was\nsaying, dear, when I get back here we'll have a good dinner,\n_nicht wahr?_\"\n",
                "\"Yes, and--good-by.\"\n",
                "She stood at the top of the stairs looking down.  He slowly\nclumped down the wooden treads, boiling with the amazing\ndiscoveries that he had said good-by to Istra, that he was not\nsorry, and that now he could offer to Nelly Croubel everything.\n",
                "Istra suddenly called,  \"O Mouse, wait just a moment.\"\n",
                "She darted like a swallow.  She threw her arm about his shoulder\nand kissed his cheek.  Instantly she was running up-stairs\nagain, and had disappeared into the studio.\n",
                "Mr. William Wrenn was walking rapidly up Riverside Drive,\nthinking about his letters to the Southern merchants.\n",
                "While he was leaving the studio building he had perfectly seen\nhimself as one who was about to go through a tumultuous agony,\nafter which he would be free of all the desire for Istra and\nready to serve Nelly sincerely and humbly.\n",
                "But he found that the agony was all over.  Even to save his\ndignity as one who was being dramatic, he couldn't keep his\nthoughts on Istra.\n",
                "Every time he thought of Nelly his heart was warm and he\nchuckled softly.  Several times out of nothing came pictures of\nthe supercilious persons whom he had heard solving the problems\nof the world at the studio on Washington Square, and he\nmuttered:  \"Oh, hope they choke.  Istra's all right, though; she\nlearnt me an awful lot.  But--gee!  I'm glad she ain't in the same\nhouse; I suppose I'd ag'nize round if she was.\"\n",
                "Suddenly, at no particular street corner on Riverside Drive, just\n_a_ street, he fled over to Broadway and the Subway.  He had to\nbe under the same roof with Nelly.  If it were only possible to\nsee her that night!  But it was midnight.  However, he formulated\na plan.  The next morning he would leave the office, find her at\nher department store, and make her go out to Manhattan Beach\nwith him for dinner that night.\n",
                "He was home.  He went happily up the stairs.  He would dream of\nNelly, and--\n",

They had finished\ntwo hot games of pinochle, and sat with their feet on a small\namiable oil-stove.  Mr. Wrenn laid her hand against his cheek\nwith infinite content.  He was outlining the situation at the\noffice.\n",
                "The business had so increased that Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle,\nthe manager, had told Rabin, the head traveling-salesman, that\nhe was going to appoint an assistant manager.  Should he, Mr.\nWrenn queried, try to get the position?  The other candidates,\nRabin and Henson and Glover, were all good friends of his, and,\nfurthermore, could he \"run a bunch of guys if he was over them?\"\n",

Maybe some day you may get to be\nassistant manager.  But I'm going to give the first try at it to\nGlover.  He's had so much more experience with meeting people\ndirectly--personally.  But you're a good man--\"\n",

                "He clattered down the slate treads of the stairs.  He fairly\nvaulted out of doors.  He stopped, startled.\n",
                "Across the ragged vacant lots to the west a vast sunset\nprocessional marched down the sky.  It had not been visible from\ntheir flat, which looked across East River to the tame grassy\nshore of a real-estate boomer's suburb.  \"Gee!\" he mourned,\n\"it's the first time I've noticed a sunset for a month!  I used\nto see knights' flags and Mandalay and all sorts of stuff in\nsunsets!\"\n",
                "Wistfully the exile gazed at his lost kingdom, till the October\nchill aroused him.\n",
