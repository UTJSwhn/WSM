<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>


<p>The publication of <cite>Growth of the Soil</cite>
in the spring of last year (1920) set
critics and readers asking for information
about the author and his works.
Later in the year further interest was aroused
by the news that Hamsun had been awarded
the Nobel Prize for literature. In December,
an article on Hamsun, giving a brief general
survey of his works, appeared in <cite>The Fortnightly
Review</cite>. This article, with some
slight alteration, is now reprinted here, the
proprietors of that journal having very kindly
granted their permission, an act of courtesy
which is the more to be appreciated considering
the brief time which has elapsed
since the original publication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Knut Hamsun is now sixty. For years
past he has been regarded as the greatest
of living Norwegian writers, and one or two
attempts have been made previously to
introduce his work into this country, but it
was not until this year (1920), with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
publication of <cite>Growth of the Soil</cite>, that he
achieved any real success, or became at all
generally known, among English readers.</p>

<p><cite>Growth of the Soil</cite> is very far indeed from
Hamsun’s earliest beginnings: far even from
the books of his early middle period, which
made his name. It is the life story of a man
in the wilds, the genesis and gradual development
of a homestead, the unit of humanity,
in the untilled, uncleared tracts that still
remain in the Norwegian Highlands. It is
an epic of earth; the history of a microcosm.
Its dominant note is one of patient strength
and simplicity; the mainstay of its working
is the tacit, stern, yet loving alliance between
Nature and the Man who faces her himself,
trusting to himself and her for the physical
means of life, and the spiritual contentment
with life which she must grant if he be
worthy. Modern man faces Nature only
by proxy, or as proxy, through others or for
others, and the intimacy is lost. In the
wilds the contact is direct and immediate;
it is the foothold upon earth, the touch of
the soil itself, that gives strength.</p>

<p>The story is epic in its magnitude, in its
calm, steady progress and unhurrying rhythm,
in its vast and intimate humanity. The
author looks upon his characters with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
great, all-tolerant sympathy, aloof yet kindly,
as a god. A more objective work of fiction
it would be hard to find.</p>

<p>Hamsun’s early work was subjective in
the extreme; so much so, indeed, as almost
to lie outside the limits of æsthetic composition.
As a boy he wrote verse under
difficulties&mdash;he was born in Gudbrandsdalen,
but came as a child to Bodø in Lofoten, and
worked with a shoemaker there for some
years, saving up money for the publication
of his juvenile efforts. He had little education
to speak of, and after a period of varying
casual occupations, mostly of the humblest
sort, he came to Christiania with the object
of studying there, but failed to make his
way. Twice he essayed his fortune in
America, but without success. For three
years he worked as a fisherman on the
Newfoundland Banks.</p>

<p>His Nordland origin is in itself significant;
it means an environment of month-long
nights and concentrated summers, in which
all feelings are intensified, and love and
dread and gratitude and longing are nearer
and deeper than in milder and more
temperate regions, where elemental opposites
are, as it were, reciprocally diluted.</p>

<p>In 1890, at the age of thirty, Hamsun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
attracted attention by the publication of
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite> (Hunger). <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite> is a record of weeks
of starvation in a city; the semi-delirious
confession of a man whose physical and
mental faculties have slipped beyond control.
He speaks and acts irrationally, and knows
it; watches himself at his mental antics and
takes himself to task for the same. And he
asks himself: Is it a sign of madness?</p>

<p>It might seem so. The extraordinary
associations, the weird fancies and bizarre
impulses that are here laid bare give an air
of convincing verisimilitude to the supposed
confessions of a starving journalist. But, as
a matter of fact, Hamsun has no need of
extraneous influences to invest his characters
with originality. Starving or fed, they can
be equally erratic. This is seen in his next
book, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>.</p>

<p>Here we have actions and reactions as
fantastic as in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite>, though the hero has here
no such excuse as in the former case. The
“mysteries,” or mystifications of Nagel, a
stranger who comes, for no particular reason
apparent, to stay in a little Norwegian town,
arise entirely out of Nagel’s own personality.</p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite> is one of the most exasperating
books that a publisher’s reader, or a
conscientious reviewer, could be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
deal with. An analysis of the principal
character is a most baffling task. One is
tempted to call him mad, and have done
with it. But, as a matter of fact, he is
uncompromisingly, unrestrainedly human;
he goes about constantly saying and doing
things that we, ordinary and respectable
people, are trained and accustomed to refrain
from saying or doing at all. He has the
self-consciousness of a sensitive child; he is
for ever thinking of what people think of
him, and trying to create an impression.
Then, with a paradoxical sincerity, he
confesses that the motive of this or that
action <em>was</em> simply to create an impression,
and thereby destroys the impression. Sometimes
he caps this by wilfully letting it
appear that the double move was carefully
designed to produce the reverse impression
of the first&mdash;until the person concerned is
utterly bewildered, and the reader likewise.</p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite> appeared in 1893. In the following
year Hamsun astonished his critics with
two books, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Ny Jord</cite> (New Ground) and
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Redaktør Lynge</cite>, both equally unlike his
previous work. With these he passes at a
bound from one-man stories, portrait studies
of eccentric characters in a remote or
restricted environment, to group subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
chosen from centres of life and culture in
Christiania. <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Redaktør Lynge</cite>&mdash;<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">redaktør</i>, of
course, means “editor”&mdash;deals largely with
political manœuvres and intrigues, the
bitterly controversial politics of Norway
prior to the dissolution of the Union with
Sweden. <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Ny Jord</cite> gives an unflattering
picture of the academic, literary, and artistic
youth of the capital, idlers for the most part,
arrogant, unscrupulous, self-important, and
full of disdain for the mere citizens and
merchants whose simple honesty and kindliness
are laughed at or exploited by the
newly dominant representatives of culture.</p>

<p>Both these books are technically superior
to the first two, inasmuch as they show
mastery of a more difficult form. But their
appeal is not so great; there is lacking a
something that might be inspiration, personal
sympathy&mdash;some indefinable essential that
the author himself has taught us to expect.
They are less <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">hamsunsk</i> than most of
Hamsun’s work. Hamsun is at his best
among the scenes and characters he loves;
tenderness and sympathy make up so great
a part of his charm that he is hardly recognisable
in surroundings or society uncongenial
to himself.</p>

<p>It would almost seem as if he realised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
something of this. For in his next work he
turns from the capital to the Nordland coast,
reverting also, in some degree, to the subjective,
keenly sensitive manner of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite>,
though now with more restraint and concentration.</p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> (1894) is probably Hamsun’s best-known
work. It is a love-story, but of an
extraordinary type, and is, moreover, important
from the fact that we are here
introduced to some of the characters and
types that are destined to reappear again
and again in his later works.</p>

<p>Nagel, the exasperating irresponsible of
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>, is at his maddest in his behaviour
towards the woman he loves. It is natural
that this should be so. When a man is
intoxicated, his essential qualities are
emphasised. If he have wit, he will be
witty; if a brutal nature, he will be a brute;
if he be of a melancholy temper, he will be
disposed to sit upon the ground and tell sad
stories of the death of kings.</p>

<p>We see this in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>. The love-making
of the hero is characterised by the same
irrational impulses, the same extravagant
actions, as in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite> and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>. But they
are now less frequent, and less involved.
The book as a whole is toned down, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
speak, from the bewildering tangle of unrestraint
in the first two. There is quite
sufficient of the erratic and unusual in the
character of Glahn, the hero, but the tone is
more subdued. The madcap youth of genius
has realised that the world looks frigidly at
its vagaries, and the secretly proud “<span  lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au
moins</i> je suis autre</span>”&mdash;more a boast than a
confession&mdash;gives place to a wistful, apologetic
admission of the difference as a fault. Here
already we have something of that resignation
which comes later to its fulness in the
story of the Wanderer with the Mute.</p>

<p>The love-story in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> takes the form of a
conflict; it is one of those battles between
the sexes, duels of wit and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</i>, such as
one finds in the plays of Marivaux. But
Hamsun sets his battle in the sign of the
heart, not of the head; it is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marivaudage</i>
of feeling, none the less deep for its erratic
utterance. Moreover, the scene is laid, not
in salons and ante-chambers, but in a landscape
such as Hamsun loves, the forest-clad
hills above a little fishing village, between
the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">højfjeld</i> and the sea. And interwoven
with the story, like an eerie breathing from
the dark of woods at dusk and dawn, is the
haunting presence of Iselin, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle dame
sans merci</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> is a book that offends against all
sorts of rules; as a literary product it is
eminently calculated to elicit, especially in
England, the Olympian “this will never do.”
To begin with, it is not so much a novel as
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">novelle</i>&mdash;a form of art little cultivated in
this country, but which lends itself excellently
to delicate artistic handling, and the creation
of that subtle influence which Hamsun’s
countrymen call <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">stemning</i>, poorly rendered
by the English “atmosphere.” The epilogue
is disproportionately long; the portion
written as by another hand is all too recognisably
in the style of the rest. And with
all his chivalrous sacrifice and violent end,
Glahn is at best a quixotic hero. Men, as
men, would think him rather a fool, and
women, as women, might flush at the thought
of a cavalier so embarrassingly unrestrained.
He is not to be idolised as a cinema star, or
the literally gymnastic hero of a perennial
Earl’s Court Exhibition set to music on the
stage. He could not be truthfully portrayed
on a flamboyant wrapper as at all seductively
masculine. In a word, he is neither a man’s
man nor a woman’s man. But he is a human
being, keenly susceptible to influences which
most of us have felt in some degree.</p>

<p>Closely allied to <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> is <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
a story of conflict between two lovers.
The actual plot can only be described as
hackneyed. Girl and boy, the rich man’s
daughter and the poor man’s son, playmates
in youth, then separated by the barriers of
social standing&mdash;few but the most hardened
of “best-sellers” catering for semi-detached
suburbia would venture nowadays to handle
such a theme. Yet Hamsun dares, and so
insistently unlike all else is the impress of
his personality that the mechanical structure
of the story is forgotten. It is interspersed
with irrelevant fancies, visions and imaginings,
a chain of tied notes heard as an
undertone through the action on the surface.
The effect is that of something straining
towards an impossible realisation; a beating
of wings in the void; a striving for utterance
of things beyond speech.</p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite> is the swan-song of Hamsun’s
subjective period. Already, in the three
plays which appeared during the years
immediately following <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>, he faces the
merciless law of change; the unrelenting
“forward” which means leaving loved things
behind. Kareno, student of life, begins his
career in resolute opposition to the old men,
the established authorities who stand for
compromise and resignation. For twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
years he remains obstinately faithful to his
creed, that the old men must step aside or
be thrust aside, to make way for the youth
that will be served. “What has age that
youth has not? Experience. Experience,
in all its poor and withered nakedness.
And what use is their experience to us, who
must make our own in every single happening
of life?” In <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Aftenrøde</cite>, the “Sunset”
of the trilogy, Kareno himself deserts the
cause of youth, and allies himself to the
party in power. And the final scene shows
him telling a story to a child: “There
was once a man who never would give
way....”</p>

<p>The madness of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite> is excused as being
delirium, due to physical suffering. Nagel,
in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>, is shown as a fool, an eccentric
intolerable in ordinary society, though he is
disconcertingly human, paradoxically sane.
Glahn, in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>, apologises for his uncouth
straightforwardness by confessing that he is
more at home in the woods, where he can
say and do what he pleases without offence.
Johannes, in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, is of humble birth,
which counts in extenuation of his unmannerly
frankness in early years. Later
he becomes a poet, and as such is exempt in
some degree from the conventional restraint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
imposed on those who aspire to polite society.
All these well-chosen characters are made to
serve the author’s purpose as channels for
poetic utterance that might otherwise seem
irrelevant. The extent to which this is
done may be seen from the way in which
Hamsun lets a character in one book enter
upon a theme which later becomes the
subject of an independent work by the
author himself. Thus Glahn is haunted by
visions of Diderik and Iselin; Johannes
writes fragments supposed to be spoken by
one Vendt the Monk. Five years after
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, Hamsun gives us the romantic
drama of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Munken Vendt</cite>, in which Diderik
and Iselin appear.</p>

<p>Throughout these early works, Hamsun
is striving to find expression for his own
sensitive personality; a form and degree
of expression sufficient to relieve his own
tension of feeling, without fusing the medium;
adequate to his own needs, yet understandable
and tolerable to ordinary human beings,
to the readers of books. The process, in
effect, is simply this: Hamsun is a poet,
with a poet’s deep and unusual feeling, and
a poet’s need of utterance. To gain a hearing,
he chooses figures whom he can conveniently
represent as fools. Secretly, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
loves them, for they are himself. But to the
world he can present them with a polite
apology, a plea for kindly indulgence.</p>

<p>It is not infrequent in literature to find the
wisest and most poignant utterances thus
laid in the mouths of poor men clad in
motley. Some of the most daring things in
Shakespeare, the newest heresies of the
Renaissance, are voiced by irresponsibles.
Of all dramatic figures, that of the fool is
most suited to the expression of concentrated
feeling. There is an arresting question in a
play of recent years, which runs something
like this: “Do you think that the things
people make fools of themselves about are
any less real and true than the things they
behave sensibly about?”</p>

<p>Most of us have at some time or another
felt that uncomfortable, almost indecently
denuding question which comes to us at
rare moments from the stage where some
great drama is being played: What is higher,
what is more real: this, or the life we live?
In that sudden flash, the matters of to-day’s
and to-morrow’s reality in our minds appear
as vulgar trifles, things of which we are
ashamed. The feeling lasts but a moment;
for a moment we have been something
higher than ourselves, in the mere desire so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
to be. Then we fall back to ourselves once
more, to the lower levels upon which alone
we can exist. And yet it is by such
potentials that we judge the highest art; by
its power to give us, if only for a moment,
something of that which the divinity of our
aspiring minds finds wanting in the confines
of reality.</p>

<p>The richness of this quality is one of
the most endearing things in Hamsun’s
characters. Their sensitiveness is a thing
we have been trained, for self-defence, to
repress. It is well for us, no doubt, that this
is so. But we are grateful for their showing
that such things <em>are</em>, we feel the richer for
a momentary glimpse of that susceptibility
we dare not encourage in ourselves. The
figures Hamsun sets before us as confessedly
unsuited to the realities of life, his vagabonds,
his failures, his fools, have power at times
to make us question whether our world of
comfort, luxury, success, is what we thought;
if it were not well lost in exchange for the
power to <em>feel</em> as they.</p>

<p>It has been said that life is a comedy to
those who think, a tragedy to those who
feel. Humanly speaking, it is one of the
greatest merits of Hamsun’s works that he
shows otherwise. His attitude towards life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
is throughout one of feeling, yet he makes of
life no tragedy, but a beautiful story.</p>

<p>“I will be young until I die,” says Kareno
in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Aftenrøde</cite>. The words are not so much a
challenge to fate as a denial of fact; he is
not fighting, only refusing to acknowledge
the power that is already hard upon him.</p>

<p>Kareno is an <em>intellectual</em> character. He
is a philosopher, a man whose perceptions
and activity lie predominantly in the sphere
of thought, not of feeling. His attempt to
carry the fire of youth beyond the grave
of youth ends in disaster; an unnecessary
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</i> due to his gratuitously attempting
the impossible.</p>

<p>Hamsun’s poet-personality, the spirit we
have seen striving for expression through the
figures of Nagel, Glahn, Johannes, and the
rest, is a creature of <em>feeling</em>. And here the
development proceeds on altogether different
lines. The emotion which fails to find
adequate outlet, even in such works as <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite>,
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>, might well
seem more of a peril than the quixotic
stubbornness of Kareno’s philosophy. Such
a flood, in its tempestuous unrest, might
seem to threaten destruction, or at best the
vain dispersal of its own power into chaos.
But by some rare guidance it is led, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
storm of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Munken Vendt</cite>, into channels of
beneficent fertility.</p>

<p>In 1904, after an interval of short stories,
letters of travel, and poems, came the story
entitled <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sværmere</cite>. The word means
“Moths.” It also stands for something
else; something for which we English, as
a sensible people, have no word. Something
pleasantly futile, deliciously unprofitable&mdash;foolish
lovers, hovering like moths
about a lamp.</p>

<p>But there is more than this that is untranslatable
in the title. <em>As</em> a title it suggests
an attitude of gentleness, tenderness, sympathy,
towards whomsoever it describes. It
is a new note in Hamsun; the opening of a
new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i>.</p>

<p>The main thread of the story bears a
certain similarity to that of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mysterier</cite>,
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>, being a love affair of
mazy windings, a tangled skein of loves-me-loves-me-not.
But it is pure comedy throughout.
Rolandsen, the telegraph operator in
love with Elise Mack, is no poet; he has
not even any pretensions to education or
social standing. He is a cheerful, riotous
“blade,” who sports with the girls of the
village, gets drunk at times, and serenades
the parson’s wife at night with his guitar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sværmere</cite> is the slightest of little stories
in itself, but full of delightful vagaries
and the most winning humour. It is the
first of Hamsun’s stories with a happy
ending.</p>

<p>The story of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Benoni</cite>, with its continuation
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Rosa</cite>, is in like vein; a tenderly humorous
portrayal of love below stairs, the principal
characters being chosen from the class who
appear as supers in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>; subjects or retainers
of the all-powerful Trader Mack. It is as if
the sub-plot in one of Shakespeare’s plays
had been taken out for separate presentment,
and the clown promoted to be hero in a play
of his own. The cast is increased, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</i>
lightly drawn in <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> is now shown more
comprehensively and in detail, making us
gradually acquainted with a whole little
community, a village world, knowing little
of any world beyond, and forming a
microcosm in itself.</p>

<p>Hamsun has returned, as it were, to the
scene of his passionate youth, but in altered
guise. He plays no part himself now, but
is an onlooker, a stander-by, chronicling, as
from a cloistered aloofness, yet with kindly
wisdom always, the little things that matter
in the lives of those around him. Wisdom
and kindliness, sympathy and humour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
understanding, these are the dominant notes
of the new phase. <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sværmere</cite> ends happily&mdash;for
it is a story of other people’s lives. So
also with <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Benoni</cite> and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Rosa</cite> at the last. And
so surely has the author established his foothold
on the new ground that he can even
bring in Edvarda, the “Iselin” figure from
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>, once more, thus linking up his brave
and lusty comedies of middle age with the
romantic tragedies of his youth, making a
comprehensive pageant-play of large-hearted
humanity.</p>

<p>Meantime, the effect upon himself is seen&mdash;and
avowed. Between <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sværmere</cite> and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Benoni</cite>
comes the frankly first-personal narrative of
a vagabond who describes himself, upon interrogation,
as “Knut Pedersen”&mdash;which is
two-thirds of Knut Pedersen Hamsun&mdash;and
hailing from Nordland&mdash;which embraces
Lofoten.</p>

<p>It does not need any showing of papers,
however, to establish the identity of Knut
Pedersen, vagabond, with the author of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>.
The opening words of the book (<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Under
Høststjærnen</cite>) are enough. “Indian summer,
mild and warm ... it is many years
now since I knew such peace. Twenty
or thirty years maybe&mdash;or maybe it was in
another life. But I have felt it some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
surely, since I go about now humming a
little tune; go about rejoicing, loving every
straw and every stone, and feeling as if they
cared for me in return....”</p>

<p>This is the Hamsun of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>. But Hamsun
now is a greater soul than in the days when
Glahn, the solitary dweller in the woods,
picked up a broken twig from the ground
and held it lovingly, because it looked poor
and forsaken; or thanked the hillock of
stone outside his hut because it stood there
faithfully, as a friend that waited his return.
He is stronger now, but no less delicate;
he loves not Nature less, but the world
more. He has learned to love his fellow-men.
Knut Pedersen, vagabond, wanders
about the country with his tramp companions,
Grindhusen, the painter who can ditch and
delve at a pinch, or Falkenberg, farm-labourer
in harvest-time, and piano-tuner
where pianos are. Here is brave comradeship,
the sharing of adventures, the ready
wit of jovial vagrants. The book is a harmless
picaresque, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">geste</i> of innocent rogue-errantry;
its place is with <cite>Lavengro</cite> and <cite>The
Cloister and the Hearth</cite>, in that ancient,
endless order of tales which link up age
with age and land with land in the unaltering,
unfrontiered fellowship of the road that kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
the spirit of poetry alive through the Dark
Ages.</p>

<p>The vagabond from Nordland has his
own adventures, his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</i>. There
is a touch of Sterne about the book; not
the exaggerated super-Sterne of Tristram
Shandy, with eighteenth-century-futurist
blanks and marbled pages, but the fluent,
casual, follow-your-fancy Sterne of the <cite>Sentimental
Journey</cite>. Yet the vagabond himself
is unobtrusive, ready to step back and be a
chronicler the moment other figures enter
into constellation. He moves among youth,
himself no longer young, and among gentlefolk,
as one making no claim to equal
rank.</p>

<p>Both these features are accentuated further
in the story of the Wanderer with the Mute.
It is a continuation of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Under Høststjærnen</cite>,
and forms the culmination, the acquiescent
close, of the self-expressional series that
began with <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite>. The discords of tortured
loveliness are now resolved into an ultimate
harmony of comely resignation and rich content.
“A Wanderer may come to fifty
years; he plays more softly then. Plays
with muted strings.” This is the keynote
of the book. The Wanderer is no longer
young; it is for youth to make the stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
old men tell. Tragedy is reserved for those
of high estate; a wanderer in corduroy,
“such as labourers wear here in the south,”
can tell the story of his chatelaine and her
lovers with the self-repression of a humbler
Henry Esmond, winning nothing for himself
even at the last, yet feeling he is still in
Nature’s debt.</p>

<p>Hamsun’s next work is <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Den Siste Glæde</cite>
(literally “The Last Joy”). The title as it
stands is expressive. The substantive is
“joy”&mdash;but it is so qualified by the preceding
“last,” a word of overwhelming
influence in any combination, that the total
effect is one of sadness. And the book itself
is a masterly presentment of gloom. Masterly&mdash;or
most natural: it is often hard to say
how much of Hamsun’s effect is due to
superlative technique and how much to the
inspired disregard of all technique. <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Den
Siste Glæde</cite> is a diary of wearisome days,
spent for the most part among unattractive,
insignificant people at a holiday resort; the
only “action” in it is an altogether pitiful
love affair, in which the narrator is involved
to the slightest possible degree. The writer
is throughout despondent; he feels himself
out of the race; his day is past. Solitude
and quiet, Nature, and his own foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
feelings&mdash;these are the “last joys” left him
now.</p>

<p>The book might have seemed a fitting, if
pathetic, ending to the literary career of the
author of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite>. Certainly it holds out no
promise of further energy or interest in life
or work. The closing words amount to a
personal farewell.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, Hamsun enters
upon a new phase of power. <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Børn av Tiden</cite>
(Children of the Age) is an objective study,
its main theme being the “marriage” conflict
touched upon in the Wanderer stories, and here
developed in a different setting and with fuller
individuality. Hamsun has here moved up
a step in the social scale, from villagers of
the Benoni type to the land-owning class.
There is the same conflict of temperaments
that we have seen before, but less violent
now; the poet’s late-won calm of mind, and
the level of culture from which his characters
now are drawn&mdash;perhaps by instinctive selection&mdash;make
for restraint. Still a romantic at
heart, he becomes more classic in form.</p>

<p><cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Børn av Tiden</cite> is also the story of Segelfoss,
in its passing from the tranquil dignity of
a semi-feudal estate to the complex and
ruthless modernity of an industrial centre.
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Segelfoss By</cite> (1915) treats of the fortunes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
the succeeding generation, and the further
development of Segelfoss into a township
(<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">By</i>).</p>

<p>Then, with <cite>Growth of the Soil</cite>, Hamsun
achieves his greatest triumph. Setting
aside all that mattered most to himself, he
turns with the experience of a lifetime rich in
conflict, to the things that matter to us all.
Deliberately shorn of all that makes for mere
effects, Isak stands out as an elemental figure,
the symbol of Man at his best, face to face
with nature and life. There is no greater
human character&mdash;reverently said&mdash;in the
Bible itself.</p>

<p>These, then, are the steps of Hamsun’s
progress as an author, from the passionate
chaos of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sult</cite> to the Miltonic, monumental
calm of <cite>Growth of the Soil</cite>. The stages in
themselves are full of beauty; the wistfulness
of <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Pan</cite> and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Victoria</cite>, the kindly humour of
<cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sværmere</cite> and <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Benoni</cite>, the autumn-tinted
resignation of the Wanderer with the Mute&mdash;they
follow as the seasons do, each with a
charm of its own, yet all deriving from one
source. His muse at first is Iselin, the embodiment
of adolescent longing, the dream of
those “whom delight flies because they give
her chase.” The hopelessness of his own
pursuit fills him with pity for mortals under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
the same spell, and he steps aside to be
a brave, encouraging chorus, or a kindly
chronicler of others’ lives. And his reward
is the love of a greater divinity, the goddess
of field and homestead. No will-o’-the-wisp,
but a presence of wisdom and calm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I</h2>


<p>Marie van Loos, housekeeper at
the Vicarage, stands by the kitchen
window looking out far up the road. She
knows the couple there by the fence&mdash;knows
them indeed, seeing ’tis no other than Telegraph-Rolandsen,
her own betrothed, and
Olga the parish clerk’s daughter. It is the
second time she has seen those two together
this spring&mdash;now what does it mean? Save
that Jomfru van Loos had a host of things to
do just now, she would have gone straight
up to them that moment and demanded an
explanation.</p>

<p>As it was, how could she? There was no
time for anything now, with the whole place
upside down, and the new priest and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
lady expected any minute. Young Ferdinand
is already posted at an upstairs window to
keep a look-out to seaward, and give warning
as soon as the boat is in sight, so that
the coffee can be ready the moment the
travellers arrive. And they would need it,
after coming all the way from Rosengaard,
four miles off. Rosengaard is the nearest
place at which the steamer calls, and from
there they come on by boat.</p>

<p>There is still a trifle of snow and ice about,
but it is May now, and the weather fine,
with long, bright days over Nordland. The
crows are getting on fast with their nests,
and the new green grass is sprouting on the
bare hummocks. In the garden, the sallows
were in bud already, for all they were standing
in snow.</p>

<p>The great question now was what the new
priest would be like. All the village was
burning to know. True, he was only coming
as chaplain for the time being, till a
permanent incumbent was appointed; but
such temporary chaplains might often remain
for a considerable time in a place like this,
with its poor fisher population, and a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
journey to the annex church every fourth
Sunday. It was by no means the sort of
living anyone would grasp at for a permanency.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that the newcomers to
the Vicarage were wealthy folk, who did
not need to think twice about every <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">skilling</i>
they spent. They had already engaged a
housekeeper and two maids in advance;
and they had not been sparing of help for
the field work either, but taken on two
farm-hands, besides young Ferdinand, who
was to be smart and obliging, and make
himself generally useful. All felt it was a
blessing to the congregation to have a
pastor so comfortably off. Such a man,
of course, would not be over-strict in the
matter of tithes and other dues; far from
it; he would doubtless reach out a helping
hand to those in need. Altogether, there
was a great deal of excitement. The lay-helpers
and other fishermen had turned out
in readiness, and were down at the boat-sheds
now, tramping up and down in their
heavy boots, chewing tobacco, spitting, and
exchanging observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Here comes Big Rolandsen at last, striding
down the road. He had left Olga
behind, and Jomfru van Loos withdrew
from her kitchen window once more. Oh,
but she would have a word with him about
it, never fear; it was no uncommon thing
for her to have matters outstanding with
Ove Rolandsen. Jomfru van Loos was of
Dutch extraction, she spoke with a Bergen
accent, and was so hasty of speech at times
that Rolandsen himself had been driven to
give her the nickname of Jomfru <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Fan los</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Big Rolandsen was always witty, and very
often improper.</p>

<p>And where was he off to now? Was it his
quite remarkable intention to go down and
meet the Vicarage people himself? Likely
as not he was no more sober now than
many a time before. There he was, walking
down, with a twig of budding sallow in his
buttonhole, and his hat a thought on one side&mdash;going
to meet them like that! The lay-helpers
down at the waterside were by no
means glad of his company at the moment&mdash;at
this particular, highly important moment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>Was it right or proper, now, for a man
to look like that? His red nose had an
air of pride ill-suited to his humble station;
and, more than that, it was his habit to let
his hair grow all through the winter, till
his head grew more and more artistic.
Jomfru van Loos, who owed him a sharp
word or so, declared that he looked like a
painter who had come down in the world,
and ended as a photographer. Four-and-thirty
was Rolandsen now, a student, and
a bachelor; he played the guitar, trolled
out the local songs with a deep voice, and
laughed till the tears flowed at all the
touching parts. That was his lordly way.
He was in charge of the telegraph station,
and had been here now for ten years in the
same place. A tall fellow, powerfully built,
and ready enough to lend a hand in a brawl.</p>

<p>Suddenly young Ferdinand gives a start.
From his attic window he catches sight of
Trader Mack’s white houseboat hurrying
round the point; next moment he is down
the stairs in three break-neck strides, shouting
through to the kitchen, “Here they
come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he hurries out to tell the farm-hands.
The men drop the things they are
holding, slip on their Sunday jackets with
all speed, and hasten down to the waterside
to help, if needed. That made ten in all
to welcome the new arrivals.</p>

<p>“<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Goddag!</i>” says the chaplain from the
stern, smiling a little, and doffing his soft
hat. All those on shore bare their heads
respectfully, and the lay-helpers bow till
their long hair falls over their eyes. Big
Rolandsen is less obsequious than the
others; he stands upright as ever, but
takes off his hat and holds it low down.</p>

<p>The chaplain is a youngish man, with
reddish whiskers and a spring crop of
freckles; his nostrils seem to be choked
with a growth of fair hair. His lady is
lying down in the deck-house, sea-sick and
miserable.</p>

<p>“We’re there now,” says her husband in
through the doorway, and helps her out.
Both of them are curiously dressed, in
thick, old clothes that look far from elegant.
Still, these, no doubt, are just some odd
over-things they have borrowed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
journey; their own rich clothes will be
inside, of course. The lady has her hat
thrust back, and a pale face with large eyes
looks out at the men. Lay-helper Levion
wades out and carries her ashore; the priest
manages by himself.</p>

<p>“I’m Rolandsen, of the Telegraph,” says
Big Rolandsen, stepping forward. He was
not a little drunk, and his eyes glared stiffly,
but being a man of the world, there was
no hesitation in his manner. Ho, that
Rolandsen, a deuce of a fellow! No one
had ever seen him at a loss when it came
to mixing with grand folk, and throwing
out elegant bits of speech. “Now if only
I knew enough,” he went on, addressing the
priest, “I might introduce us all. Those
two there, I fancy, are the lay-helpers.
These two are your farm-hands. And this
is Ferdinand.”</p>

<p>And the priest and his wife nod round to
all. <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Goddag! Goddag!</i> They would soon
learn to know one another. Well ... the
next thing would be to get their things on
shore.</p>

<p>But Lay-helper Levion looks hard at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
deck-house, and stands ready to wade out
once more. “Aren’t there any little ones?”
he asks.</p>

<p>No answer; all turn towards the priest
and his wife.</p>

<p>“If there won’t be any children?” asks
the lay-helper again.</p>

<p>“No,” says the boatman.</p>

<p>The lady flushed a little. The chaplain
said:</p>

<p>“There are only ourselves.... You men
had better come up and I’ll settle with you
now.”</p>

<p>Oh, a rich man, of course. A man who
would not withhold his due from the poor.
The former priest never “settled” with
people at all; he only said thanks, and that
would be all “for now.”</p>

<p>They walked up from the quay, Rolandsen
leading the way. He walked by the side
of the road, in the snow, to leave place for
the others; he wore light shoes, in his vain
and showy way, but it did not seem to hurt
him; he even walked with his coat unbuttoned,
for all it was only May and the
wind cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, there’s the church,” says the
priest.</p>

<p>“It looks old,” says his wife. “I suppose
there’s no stove inside?” she asks.</p>

<p>“Why, I can’t say for certain,” answers
Rolandsen. “But I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>The priest started. This man, then, was
no church-goer, but one who made little
distinction between week-day and Sabbath.
And he grew more reserved thenceforward.</p>

<p>Jomfru van Loos is standing on the steps;
Rolandsen introduces her as well. And,
having done so, he takes off his hat and
turns to go.</p>

<p>“Ove! Wait a minute!” whispered
Jomfru van Loos.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen did not wait a minute;
he took off his hat once more and retired
backwards down the steps. Rather a curious
person, thought the priest.</p>

<p><i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Fruen</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> had gone inside at once. She
was feeling a little better now, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
taking stock of the place. The nicest and
lightest room she assigned to her husband
as a study, and reserved to herself the
bedroom Jomfru van Loos had occupied
before.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

</a>
</div>




<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>


<p>No, Rolandsen did not wait a minute;
he knew his Jomfru van Loos, and
had no doubt as to what she wanted.
Rolandsen was not easily persuaded to
anything he did not care about himself.</p>

<p>A little way along the road he met a
fisherman who had come out too late to
be present at the arrival. This was Enok,
a pious, inoffensive man, who always walked
with downcast eyes and wore a kerchief
tied round his head for earache.</p>

<p>“You’re too late,” said Rolandsen as
he passed.</p>

<p>“Has he come?”</p>

<p>“He has. I shook hands with him.”
Rolandsen passed on, and called back over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his shoulder, “Enok, mark what I say. <em>I
envy that man his wife!</em>”</p>

<p>Now saying a foolish and most improper
thing like that to Enok was choosing the
very man of all men. Enok would be sure
to bring it about.</p>

<p>Rolandsen walked farther and farther
along by the wood, and came to the river.
Here was the fish-glue factory, owned by
Trader Mack; some girls were employed
on the place, and it was Rolandsen’s way
to chaff them as often as he passed. He
was a very firebrand for that, and none
could deny it. Moreover, he was in high
spirits to-day, and stayed longer than usual.
The girls saw at once that he was splendidly
in drink.</p>

<p>“You, Ragna, what d’you think it is
makes me come up here every day?” says
Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” says Ragna.</p>

<p>“Oh, you think, of course, it’s old Mick.”</p>

<p>The girls laughed at that. “Old Mick,
ha, ha! Old Nick, he means.”</p>

<p>“It’s for your salvation,” says Rolandsen.
“You’d better take care of yourself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fisher-lads about here; they’re a wicked
lot.”</p>

<p>“Wicked, indeed! And what about yourself,
then?” says another girl. “With two
children of your own already. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Nicoline, now how can you say such
a thing? You’ve been a thorn in my heart
and near the death of me for more than I
can say, and that you know. But as for
you, Ragna, I’m going to see you saved,
and that without mercy.”</p>

<p>“You go and talk to Jomfru van Loos,”
says Ragna.</p>

<p>“But you’ve desperate little sense,”
Rolandsen went on. “Now those fish-heads,
for instance. How long do you
steam them before you screw down the
valve?”</p>

<p>“Two hours,” says Ragna.</p>

<p>Rolandsen nods to himself. He had
reckoned that up and worked it out before.
Ho, that firebrand Rolandsen, he knew well
enough what it was took him up to the
factory every day, chaffing the girls and
sniffing about all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t take that lid off, Pernille,” he cried
suddenly. “Are you out of your senses, girl?”</p>

<p>Pernille flushes red. “Frederik he said
I was to stir it round,” she says.</p>

<p>“Every time you lift the lid, some of the
heat goes out,” says Rolandsen.</p>

<p>But a moment later, when Frederik Mack,
the trader’s son, came up, Rolandsen turned
off into his usual jesting tone once more.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it you, Pernille, that was in
service at the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand’s</i> one year, and
bullied the life out of everyone in the place?
Smashing everything to bits in a rage&mdash;all
barring the bedclothes, perhaps.”</p>

<p>The other girls laughed; Pernille was
the gentlest creature that ever lived, and
weakly to boot. Moreover, her father was
organ-blower at the church, which gave her
a sort of godliness, as it were.</p>

<p>Coming down on to the road again,
Rolandsen caught sight of Olga once more&mdash;coming
from the store, no doubt. She
quickened her pace, hurrying to avoid him;
it would never do for Rolandsen to think
she had been waiting about for him. But
Rolandsen had no such idea; he knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
if he did not catch this young maid face
to face she would always hurry away and
disappear. And it did not trouble him in
the least that he made no progress with
her; far from it. It was not Olga by any
means that filled his mind.</p>

<p>He comes home to the telegraph station,
and walks in with his lordliest air, to ward
off his assistant, who wanted to gossip.
Rolandsen was not an easy man to work
with just at present. He shut himself up
in a little room apart, that no one ever
entered save himself and one old woman.
Here he lived and slept.</p>

<p>This room is Rolandsen’s world.
Rolandsen is not all foolishness and drink,
but a great thinker and inventor. There
is a smell of acids and chemicals and
medicine in that room of his; the smell
oozed out into the passage and forced every
stranger to notice it. Rolandsen made no
secret of the fact that he kept all these
medicaments about solely to mask the smell
of the quantities of <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">brændevin</i> he was always
drinking. But that again was Ove Rolandsen’s
unfathomable artfulness....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that he used
those liquids in bottles and jars for his
experiments. He had discovered a chemical
process for the manufacture of fish-glue&mdash;a
new method that would leave Trader Mack
and his factory simply nowhere. Mack had
set up his plant at considerable expense; his
means of transport were inadequate, and
his supplies of raw material restricted to
the fishing season. Moreover, the business
was superintended by his son Frederik, who
was by no means an expert. Rolandsen
could manufacture fish-glue from a host of
other materials than fish heads, and also
from the waste products of Mack’s own
factory. Furthermore, from the last residue
of all he could extract a remarkable dye.</p>

<p>Save for his weight of poverty and helplessness,
Rolandsen of the Telegraphs would
have made his invention famous by this
time. But no one in the place could come
by ready money except through the agency
of Trader Mack, and, for excellent reasons,
it was impossible to go to him in this case.
He had once ventured to suggest that the
fish-glue from the factory was over-costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to produce, but Mack had merely waved
his hand in his lordly, careless way, and
said that the factory was a gold-mine,
nothing less. Rolandsen himself was burning
to show forth the results of his work.
He had sent samples of his product to
chemists at home and abroad, and satisfied
himself that it was good enough so far.
But he got no farther. He had yet to give
the pure, finished liquid to the world, and
take out patents in all countries.</p>

<p>So that it was not without motive and
vainly that Rolandsen had turned out that
day to receive the new chaplain and his
family. Rolandsen, the wily one, had a
little plan of his own. For if the priest
were a wealthy man, he could, no doubt,
invest a little in a safe and important invention.
“If no one else will do it, I will”&mdash;that
was the thing he would say, no doubt.
Rolandsen had hopes.</p>

<p>Alas, Rolandsen was always having hopes&mdash;a
very little was enough to fire him. On
the other hand he took his disappointments
bravely; none could say otherwise than that
he bore himself stiffly and proudly, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
not to be crushed. There was Mack’s
daughter Elise, for instance, even she had
not crushed him. A tall, handsome girl,
with a brown skin and red lips, and twenty-three
years of age. It was whispered that
Captain Henriksen, of the coasting steamer,
worshipped her in secret; but years came
and years passed, and nothing happened.
What could be the matter? Rolandsen had
already made an eternal fool of himself three
years back; when she was only twenty he
had laid his heart at her feet. And she had
been kind enough not to understand him.
That was where Rolandsen ought to have
stopped and drawn back, but he went
forward instead, and now, last year, he had
begun to speak openly. Elise Mack had
been forced to laugh in his face, to make
this presumptuous telegraph person realise
the gulf between them. Was she not a
lady, who had kept no less than Captain
Henriksen waiting years for her consent?</p>

<p>And then it was that Rolandsen went off
and got engaged to Jomfru van Loos. Ho,
he was not the man to take his death of a
refusal from high quarters!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But now it was spring again. And the
spring was a thing well-nigh intolerable to
a great heart. It drove creation to its
uttermost limit; ay, it blew with spiced
winds into innocent nostrils.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>


<p>The herring are moving in from the
sea. The master seiners lie out in
their boats, peering through glasses at the
water all day long. Where the birds hover
in flocks, swooping down now and then to
snap at the water, there are the herring to
be found; already they can be taken in
deep water with the nets. But now comes
the question whether they will move up
into shallower water, into the creeks and
fjords where they can be cut off from retreat
by the seine. It is then that the bustle and
movement begins in earnest, with shouting
and swarming and crowding up of men and
ships. And there is money to be made, a
harvest in plenty as the sands of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The fisherman is a gambler. He lays out
his nets or his lines, and waits for the haul;
he casts his seine and leaves the rest to
fate. Often he meets with only loss and
loss again, his gear is carried out to sea, or
sunk, or ruined by storms, but he furnishes
himself anew and tries again. Sometimes
he ventures farther off, to some grounds
where he has heard of others finding luck,
rowing and toiling for weeks over stubborn
seas, only to find he has come too late; the
fishing is at an end. But now and again the
prize may lie waiting for him on his way,
and stop him and fill his boat with money.
No one can say whom luck will favour
next; all have like grounds, or hope....</p>

<p>Trader Mack had everything in readiness;
his seine was in the boat, his master seiner
swept the offing with his glass. Mack had
a schooner and a couple of coasting-boats in
the bay, emptied and cleaned after their
voyage to Bergen with dried fish; he would
load them up with herring now if the herring
came; his store-loft was bursting with
empty barrels. He was a buyer himself as
well, in the market for herrings to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
quantity, and he had provided himself with
a stock of ready money, to take all he could
before the price went up.</p>

<p>Half-way through May, Mack’s seine
made its first haul. Nothing to speak of,
only some fifty barrels, but the catch was
noised abroad, and, a few days later, a
stranger crew appeared in the bay. Things
looked like business.</p>

<p>Then one night there was a burglary at
Mack’s office in the factory. It was a bold
misdemeanour indeed; the nights now were
shining bright from evening to morning,
and everything could be seen far off. The
thief had broken open two doors and stolen
two hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>.</p>

<p>It was an altogether unprecedented
happening in the village, and a thing
beyond understanding. To break in and
steal from Mack&mdash;from Mack himself&mdash;even
aged folk declared they had never heard the
like in their days. The village folk might
do a little pilfering and cheating in accordance
with their humble station, but burglary
on a grand scale was more than they would
ever attempt. And suspicion fell at once on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the stranger crew, who were questioned
closely.</p>

<p>But the stranger crew were able to prove
that they had been out, with every man on
board, four miles away, on the night.</p>

<p>This was a terrible blow to Trader Mack.
It meant that the thief was someone in the
village itself.</p>

<p>Trader Mack cared little for the money;
he said openly that the thief must have
been a fool not to take more. But that any
of his own people should steal from him&mdash;the
idea cut him to the quick, mighty man
as he was, and the protector of them all.
Did he not furnish half the entire communal
budget with the taxes he paid on his various
undertakings?&mdash;and had any deserving case
ever been turned away from his door
without relief?</p>

<p>Mack offered a reward for information
leading to discovery. Something had to be
done. There were strange boats coming in
now almost every day, and a nice idea they
would gain of the relations between Trader
Mack and his people when it was found
that they robbed and stole his money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Like the open-handed merchant prince he
was, Mack fixed the reward at four hundred
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>. Then all could see he was not
afraid of putting up a round sum.</p>

<p>The story came to the ears of the new
priest, and, on Trinity Sunday, when the
sermon was to be about Nicodemus who
came to Jesus in the night, he made use of
the opportunity to deliver an attack upon
the culprit. “Here they come to us by
night,” he said, “and break open our doors
and steal away our means of life. Nicodemus
did no wrong; he was a timorous
man, and chose the night for his going, but
he went on his soul’s errand. But what did
men do now? Alas, the world had grown
in evil-doing, the night was used for
plundering and stealing. Let the guilty be
punished; bring him forth!”</p>

<p>The new priest was found to be a fighting
cock. This was the third time he had
preached, and already he had persuaded
many of the sinners in the parish to mend
their ways. When he stood up in the
pulpit, he was so pale and strange that he
looked like a madman. Some of the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>gregation
found the first Sunday quite
enough, and did not venture to come again.
Even Jomfru van Loos was shaken, and
that was no little thing. Rough and hard as
a rasp was Jomfru van Loos, and had been
all her days till now. The two maids under
her noted the change with much content.</p>

<p>There was a considerable gathering in
the place now. And there were some who
were not displeased at the discomfiture of
Trader Mack. Mack was getting too mighty
a man altogether, with his two trading
stations, his seines, his factory, and his
numerous vessels; the fisherfolk from other
stations held by their own traders, who were
condescending and easy to get on with, and
who did not affect white collars or deerskin
gloves as did Mack. The burglary was no
more than he deserved for his high-and-mightiness.
And as for offering rewards
of so-and-so many hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> for this,
that, and the other&mdash;Mack would be better
advised to keep his ready cash for buying
herring, if the herring came. After all, his
money was not beyond counting; not like
the stars in the sky. Who could say but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that the whole thing might have been
cleverly contrived by himself, or his son
Frederik: a sham burglary, to make it
appear that he could afford to lose money
like grass, while all the time he was in sore
need of cash? So the gossip ran among the
boats and on shore.</p>

<p>Mack realised that he must make a good
impression. Here were folk from five
different parishes who would carry back
word of what sort of man he was to traders
and relatives in other parts. Again and
again it must be seen what manner of man
was Trader Mack of Rosengaard.</p>

<p>Next time he had occasion to go up to the
factory Mack hired a steamer for the journey.
It was four miles from the stopping-place,
and it cost a deal of money, but Mack took
no heed of that. There was a great to-do
about the place when the steamer came
bustling in with Mack and his daughter
Elise on board. He was lord of the vessel,
so to speak, and stood there on board with
his red sash round his waist, for all it was
a summer’s day. As soon as father and
daughter had landed, the steamer put about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and went off at once; all could see that it
had come for their sake only. And in face
of this, some even of the stranger folk bowed
to the power of Mack.</p>

<p>But Mack did more. He could not forget
the disgrace of that burglary affair. He put
up a new placard, promising that the reward
of four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> would be paid even to
the thief himself if he came forward. Surely
this was unequalled as a piece of chivalrous
generosity? All must admit after this that
it was not the money, a few miserable <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>,
that troubled him. But the gossip was not
stilled even now. There were still whisperings:
“If the thief’s the man I think, you’ll
see he’ll not own up to it now any more than
before. But never a word that I said so!”</p>

<p>Mack the all-powerful was in an intolerable
position. His reputation was being undermined.
For twenty years past he had been
the great man of the place, and all had made
way for him respectfully; now there seemed
to be less of respect in their greetings. And
this despite the fact that he had been
decorated with a Royal Order. A great
man indeed he had been. He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
spokesman of the village, the fishermen
worshipped him, the little traders of the outlying
stations imitated his ways. Mack had
stomach trouble, brought on, no doubt, by
his royal table and splendid living, and he
wore a broad red sash round his waist as
soon as it began to be at all cold. Soon the
little traders of the outlying stations began
to wear red sashes too, for all they were
but insignificant folk&mdash;upstarts whom Mack
graciously allowed to live. They too
would have it appear that they were great
men living in luxury, with stomach troubles
due to extravagant over-feeding. Mack
went to church in shoes that creaked, and
walked up the aisle with supercilious noises;
but even his creaky shoes were copied by
others after him. There were some, indeed,
who set their shoes in water and dried them
hard for Sundays, to creak emphatically
among the congregation. Mack had been
the great example in every way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>


<p>Rolandsen sits in his laboratory,
hard at work. Looking out from the
window he marks how a certain branch of
a certain tree in the wood moves up and
down. Somebody must be shaking it, but
the leaves are too thick for him to see more.
Rolandsen goes back to his work.</p>

<p>But somehow the work seemed to clog
to-day. He took his guitar and tried singing
one of his joyful laments, but even that
failed to please him. The spring was come,
and Rolandsen was troubled.</p>

<p>Elise Mack was come; he had met her
the evening before. Proud and haughty she
was, and carried herself like a lady; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
seemed as if she would have tried to please
him a little with a touch of kindliness here
and there, but he would have none of it.</p>

<p>“I saw the telegraph people at Rosengaard
before I left,” she said.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen had no wish to claim
friendship with the telegraph people; he
was no colleague of theirs. She was trying
to emphasise the distance between herself
and him once more&mdash;ho-ho! He would pay
her out for that!</p>

<p>“You must teach me the guitar some
day,” she said.</p>

<p>Now this was a thing to start at and to
accept with thanks. But Rolandsen would
have none of it. On the contrary, he would
pay her out on the spot. He said:</p>

<p>“Very pleased, I’m sure. Whenever you
like. You can have my guitar.”</p>

<p>Yes, that was the way he treated her. As
if she were any but Elise Mack, a lady
worth ten thousand guitars.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she said. “But we
might use it to practise on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you a present of it.”</p>

<p>But at that she tossed her head, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you; I’d rather be excused.”</p>

<p>The wily Rolandsen had touched her
there. And then all at once he forgot every
thought of paying her out, and murmured:</p>

<p>“I only meant to give you the only thing
I had.”</p>

<p>And with that he raised his hat and bowed
deeply, and walked away.</p>

<p>He walked away to the parish clerk’s in
search of Olga. The spring was come, and
Rolandsen must have a lady-love; ’twas no
light thing to rule such a big heart. But
apart from that he was paying attention to
Olga with a purpose. There was some talk
about Frederik Mack, how he had an eye to
Olga himself. And Rolandsen meant to cut
him out, no less. Frederik was brother to
Elise herself, and it would do the family
good if one of them were jilted. But anyhow,
Olga was attractive enough in herself.
Rolandsen had seen her grow up from a slip
of a child; there was little money to spare in
the home, and she had to wear her clothes
as far as they would go before getting new
things; but she was a bright, pretty girl, and
her shyness was charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Rolandsen had met her two days in
succession. The only way to manage it was
by going straight up to the house and lending
her father a book every day. He had to
force these books on the old man, who had
never asked for them and could not understand
them. Rolandsen had to speak up for
his books and plead their cause. They were
the most useful books in the world, he said,
and he, Rolandsen, was bent on making
them known, on spreading them abroad.
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Værsaagod</i>!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>He asked the old man if he could cut hair.
But the parish clerk had never cut hair in
his life; Olga did all the hair-cutting in the
house. Whereupon Rolandsen addressed
himself to Olga, with prayers and eloquent
entreaties, to cut his hair. Olga blushed
and hid herself. “I couldn’t,” she said.
But Rolandsen routed her out again, and
overwhelmed her with irresistible words
until she agreed.</p>

<p>“How do you like it done?” she
asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>“Just as you like,” he answered. “As if
I could think of having it otherwise.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to her father, he tangled him
up in a maze of intricate questions, until the
old man could stand no more, and at last
withdrew to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Rolandsen, elated, grew more extravagant
than ever. He turned to Olga and said:</p>

<p>“When you go out in the dark on a
winter evening and come into a lighted room,
then all the light comes hurrying from everywhere
to gather in your eyes.”</p>

<p>Olga did not understand a word of all this,
but said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rolandsen, “and it’s the same
with me when I come in and see you.”</p>

<p>“Is it short enough here now?” asked
Olga.</p>

<p>“No, not nearly. Just keep on. Do it
just the way you like. Ah, you thought
you could slip away and hide&mdash;didn’t you?&mdash;but
you couldn’t. It was like the lightning
putting out a spark.”</p>

<p>Of all the mad talk....</p>

<p>“I could manage better if you’d keep
your head still,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I can’t look at you. Say, Olga,
have you a sweetheart?”</p>

<p>Olga was all unprepared for this. She
was not so old and experienced as yet but
that some things could put her out of
countenance.</p>

<p>“Me? No,” was all she said. “Now
I think it’ll have to do as it is. I’ll just
round it off a little.” She spoke gently,
having some idea he must be drunk.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen was not drunk at all; he
was sober. He had been working hard
of late; the gathering of strangers in the
place had kept the telegraph busy.</p>

<p>“No, don’t stop yet,” he urged. “Cut
it round once more&mdash;once or twice more&mdash;yes,
do.”</p>

<p>Olga laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no sense in that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but your eyes are like twin stars,”
he said. “And when you smile, it’s sunlight
all round and all over me.”</p>

<p>She took away the cloth, and brushed
him down, and swept up the hair from the
floor. Rolandsen bent down to help her,
and their hands met. She was a maid, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
felt the breath of her lips close to, and it
thrilled him warmly. He took her hand.
Her dress, he saw, was fastened at the
throat with just an ordinary pin. It looked
wretchedly poor.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;what did you do that for?” she
stammered.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I mean, thank you for doing
my hair. If it wasn’t for being firmly and
everlastingly promised to another, I’d be in
love with you this minute.”</p>

<p>She stood up with the clippings of hair
in her hands, and he leaned back.</p>

<p>“Now your clothes’ll be all in a mess,”
she said, and left the room.</p>

<p>When her father came in, Rolandsen had
to be jovial once more; he stretched out
his shorn head, and drew his hat down over
his ears to show it was too big for him
now. Then suddenly he looked at the
time, said he must get back to the station,
and went off.</p>

<p>Rolandsen went to the store. He asked
to look at some brooches and pins&mdash;the
most expensive sort. He picked out an
imitation cameo, and said he would pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for it later, if that would do. But that
would not do; Rolandsen owed too much
already. Consequently, he was reduced
to taking a cheap little glass thing, coloured
to look like agate&mdash;this being all his few
small coins would run to. And Rolandsen
went off with his treasure.</p>

<p>That was the evening before....</p>

<p>And now, here sits Rolandsen in his room,
and cannot get on with his work. He puts
on his hat and goes out to see who it might
be waving branches in the wood. And
walks straight into the lion’s jaws. Jomfru
van Loos it was had made that sign, and
she stands there waiting for him. Better
have curbed his curiosity.</p>

<p>“<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Goddag!</i>” says Jomfru van Loos.
“What on earth have you been doing
with your hair?”</p>

<p>“I always have it cut in the spring,”
said he.</p>

<p>“I cut it for you last year. I wasn’t
good enough this, it seems.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to have any quarrels with
you,” says he.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’m not. And you’ve no call to
stand here pulling up all the forest by the
roots for everyone to see.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no call to stand there being
funny,” says she.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stand out down on the
road and wave an olive branch?” says
Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“Did you cut your hair yourself?”</p>

<p>“Olga cut my hair, if you want to
know.”</p>

<p>Yes, Olga, who might one day be the
wife of Frederik Mack; she had cut his
hair. Rolandsen was not inclined to hide
the fact; on the contrary, it was a thing to
be blazoned abroad.</p>

<p>“Olga, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Well, and why not? Her father
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired of your goings-on,” said
Jomfru van Loos. “Don’t you be surprised
if you find it’s all over between us
one fine day.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen stood thinking for a moment.</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps that would be best,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” cried Jomfru van Loos.
“What’s that you say?”</p>

<p>“I say you’re clean out of your senses in
the spring. Look at me now; did you ever
see the least little restlessness about me in
the spring?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a man,” she answered carelessly.
“But, anyhow, I won’t put up with
this nonsense about Olga.”</p>

<p>“This new priest&mdash;is he rich?” asked
Rolandsen.</p>

<p>Jomfru van Loos wiped her eyes and
turned sharp and sensible all at once.</p>

<p>“Rich? As far as I can see he’s as poor
as can be.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen’s hope was shattered.</p>

<p>“You should see his clothes,” she went
on. “And her’s. Why, some of her petticoats....
But he’s a wonderful preacher.
Have you heard him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“One of the wonderfullest preachers I’ve
ever heard,” says Jomfru van Loos in her
Bergen dialect.</p>

<p>“And you’re quite sure he’s not rich?”</p>

<p>“I know this much; he’s been up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
store, and asked them to let him have things
on credit from there.”</p>

<p>For a moment Rolandsen’s world was
darkened, and he turned to go.</p>

<p>“Are you going?” asked Jomfru van
Loos.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. What did you want with
me, anyway?”</p>

<p>So that was the way he took it! Well,
now ... Jomfru van Loos was already
some way converted by the new priest,
and strove to be meek and mild, but her
nature would break out now and again.</p>

<p>“You mark my words,” she said.
“You’re going too far.”</p>

<p>“All right!” said Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“You’re doing me a cruel wrong.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Rolandsen coolly as ever.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear it any longer; I’ll have to
give you up.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen thought this over once more.
And then he said:</p>

<p>“I thought it would come to this. But
seeing I’m not God, I can’t help it. Do
as you please.”</p>

<p>“Right, then,” said she furiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“That first evening up here in the
wood&mdash;you weren’t in such a temper
then. I kissed you, and never a sound
you made then but the loveliest little
squeak.”</p>

<p>“I <em>didn’t</em> squeak,” said Jomfru van Loos
indignantly.</p>

<p>“And I loved you for ever and ever,
and thought you were going to be a fine
particular joy. Ho, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about me,” she said
bitterly. “But what’s it to come to with
you now?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I don’t know. I don’t care
now, anyway.”</p>

<p>“For you needn’t imagine it’ll ever come
to anything with you and Olga. She’s to
have Frederik Mack.”</p>

<p>Was she? thought Rolandsen. So it was
common talk already. He walked away
thoughtfully, and Jomfru van Loos went
with him. They came down on to the
road and walked on.</p>

<p>“You look nice with your hair short,” she
said. “But it’s badly cut, wretchedly badly
cut.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you lend me three hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Three hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>?”</p>

<p>“For six months.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t lend you the money anyway.
It’s all over between us now.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen nodded, and said, “Right,
then, that’s agreed.”</p>

<p>But when they reached the Vicarage gate,
where Rolandsen had to turn off, she said,
“I haven’t the money. I wish I had.”
She gave him her hand, and said, “I can’t
stand here any longer now; good-bye for
the present.” And when she had gone a
few steps, she turned round and said,
“Isn’t there anything else you’d like me
to say?”</p>

<p>“No; what should there be?” said Rolandsen. “I’ve nothing that I know of.”</p>

<p>She went. And Rolandsen felt a sense of
relief, and hoped in his heart it might be for
the last time.</p>

<p>There was a bill stuck up on the fence,
and he stopped to read it; it was Trader
Mack’s latest announcement about the burglary:
Four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Speciedaler</i> for infor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>mation.
The reward would be paid even to
the thief himself if he came forward and
confessed.</p>

<p>Four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Speciedaler</i>! thought Rolandsen
to himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>


<p>No, the new priest was not a rich man,
far from it. It was only his poor
little wife who was full of thoughtless,
luxurious fancies she had been brought up
with, and wanted a host of servants and
such. There was nothing for her to do
herself in the house; they had no children,
and she had never learned housekeeping,
and that was why she was for ever hatching
childish ideas out of her little head. A
sweet and lovely torment in the house she
was.</p>

<p>Heavens alive, how the good priest had
fought his comical battles with his wife again
and again, trying to teach her a scrap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sense and thought and order! For four
years he had striven with her in vain. He
picked up threads and bits of paper from the
floor, put odds and ends of things in their
proper places, closed the door after her,
tended the stoves, and screwed the ventilators
as was needed. When his wife went
out, he would make a tour of the rooms and
see the state she had left them in: hairpins
here, there, and everywhere; combs full of
combings; handkerchiefs lying about; chairs
piled up with garments. And he shuddered
and put things straight again. In his bachelor
days, when he lived by himself in an attic,
he had felt less homeless than he did now.</p>

<p>He had scolded and entreated at first, with
some effect; his wife admitted he was right,
and promised to improve. And then she
would get up early the next morning and set
about putting things in order high and low,
like a child in a sudden fit of earnestness,
playing “grown-up peoples,” and overdoing
it. But the fit never lasted; a few days
after all was as before. It never occurred
to her to wonder at the disorder when it
appeared once more; on the contrary, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
could not understand why her husband
should begin again with his constant discontent.
“I knocked over that dish and
it smashed,” she would say. “It was only
a cheap thing, so it doesn’t matter.”&mdash;“But
the pieces have been lying about ever since
this morning,” he answered.</p>

<p>One day she came in and told him that
Oline the maid would have to go. Oline
the maid had been rude enough to complain
about her mistress’s way of taking things out
of the kitchen and leaving them about all
over the place.</p>

<p>And so, after a time, the priest grew
hardened to it all, and gave up his daily
protest; he still went on setting in order
and putting things straight, but it was with
compressed lips and as few words as might
be. And his wife made no remark; she was
used to having someone to clear up after
her. Her husband, indeed, really felt at
times that she was to be pitied. There
she was, going about so pleasantly, a trifle
thin, and poorly dressed, yet never uttering
a sigh at her poverty, though she had been
brought up to lack for nothing. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sit and sew, altering her dresses that had
been altered so many times already, humming
over her work as cheerfully as a young girl.
Then suddenly her childishness would break
out; the mistress of the house would throw
down her work, leave everything strewed as
it fell, and go off for a walk. And chairs
and tables might be left for days strewn with
tacked sleeves and unpicked skirts. Where
did she go? It was an old habit of hers
from her youth at home to go fluttering
about among the shops; she delighted in
buying things. She could always find some
use for remnants of material, bits of ribbon,
combs and perfumes and toilet trifles, odd
little metal things, matchboxes, and the like.
Much better buy a big thing and have done
with it, thought her husband; never mind
if it were expensive and brought him into
debt. He might try to write a book, a
popular Church history, or something, and
pay for it that way.</p>

<p>And so the years passed. There were
frequent little quarrels; but the two were
fond of each other none the less, and as
long as the priest did not interfere too much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
they managed well enough. But he had a
troublesome way of keeping an eye on some
little thing or other even from a distance,
even from his office window; only yesterday
he had noticed a couple of blankets left
out in the rain. Should he tell someone?
Then suddenly he saw his wife coming
back from her walk, hurrying in out of the
rain. She would notice them herself, no
doubt. But she went straight up to her
room. He called out into the kitchen;
there was no one there, and he could
hear Jomfru van Loos out in the dairy.
So he went out himself and brought the
blankets in.</p>

<p>And so the matter might have passed off,
and no more said. But the priest could not
keep his peace, foolish man. In the evening
his wife asked for the blankets. They were
brought. “They’re wet,” said she.&mdash;“They
would have been wetter if I hadn’t fetched
them in out of the rain,” said her husband.
But at that she turned on him. “Was it
you that fetched them in? There was no
need for you to do anything of the sort; I
would have told the maids myself to fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
them in.” He smiled bitterly at that; if
he had left it till she told the maids, the
blankets would have been hanging out now.</p>

<p>But his wife was offended. Was there
any need to make such a fuss about a drop
of rain or so? “Oh, but you’re unreasonable,”
she said; “always bothering about all
sorts of things.”&mdash;“I wish I were not obliged
to bother about such things,” said he. “Just
look at your washing-basin now; what’s it
doing on the bed?”&mdash;“I put it there because
there was no room anywhere else.”&mdash;“If you
had another wash-stand, it would be all the
same,” said he. “You’d have that loaded
up with other things too in no time.” Then
she lost patience, and said, “Oh, how can
you be so unreasonable; really, I think you
must be ill. I can’t bear any more of it, I
can’t!” And she sat down, staring before
her.</p>

<p>But she bore it all the same. A moment
after it was all forgotten, and her kind
heart forgave him the wrong. Careless and
happy she was; it was her nature.</p>

<p>And the priest kept more and more to
his study, where the general disorder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the house rarely penetrated. He was a big,
sturdy man, and worked like a horse. He
had inquired of his lay-helpers as to the
moral tone of the village, and what he
learned was by no means satisfactory.
Wherefore he wrote letters of reprimand
and warning to one and another of his
flock, and where that did not avail, he went
in person to visit the delinquents, till he
came to be looked on with respect and awe.
He spared none. He had himself ascertained
that one of his helpers, Levion, had
a sister who was far too easy and accommodating
towards the fisher-lads; she too
received a letter. He sent for her brother,
and gave him the letter to deliver. “Give
her that. And tell her I shall watch
her goings about with an observant
eye!”</p>

<p>Trader Mack came to call one day, and
was shown into the parlour. It was a brief
but important visit. Mack came to offer
his assistance if any should be needed in
helping the poor of the village. The priest
thanked him, glad at heart. If he had not
been sure of it before, at least he knew now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that Mack of Rosengaard was the protector
of them all. An elegant, authoritative old
gentleman; even Fruen herself, town-bred
as she was, could not but feel impressed.
A great man, beyond doubt&mdash;and those
must be real stones in the pin he wore in
his shirt-front.</p>

<p>“The fishery’s doing well,” said Mack.
“I’ve made another haul. Nothing to
speak of, only some twenty barrels, but it
all helps, you know. And then it occurred
to me that we ought not to forget our duty
towards our neighbours.”</p>

<p>“Just so!” said the priest delightedly.
“That’s as it should be. And twenty
barrels, is that what you would call a little
haul? I’ve no knowledge of these matters
myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, two or three thousand barrels
would be better.”</p>

<p>“Two or three thousand!” said Fruen.
“Only fancy!”</p>

<p>“But when I don’t make big enough
hauls myself, I can always buy from others.
There was a boat from the outlying parts
made a good haul yesterday; I bought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
up on the spot. I’m going to load every
vessel I’ve got with herring.”</p>

<p>“It’s a big business this of yours,” said
the priest.</p>

<p>Mack admitted that it was getting on
that way. It was an old-established business
when he came into it, he said, but he
had worked it up, and extended its operations.
For the sake of the children, he felt
he must.</p>

<p>“But, heavens, how many factories and
stores and things have you altogether?”
asked Fruen enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Mack laughed, and said, “Really, <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Frue</i>,
I couldn’t say offhand, without counting.”</p>

<p>But Mack forgot his troubles and annoyances
for a little as he sat talking; he
was by no means displeased at being asked
about his numerous factories and stores.</p>

<p>“You’ve a bakery at Rosengaard,” said
Fruen, thinking all at once of her housekeeping.
“I wish we lived nearer. We can’t
make nice bread, somehow, at home here.”</p>

<p>“There’s a baker at the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmandsgaard</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s never any bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“He drinks a great deal, I’m sorry to
say,” put in the priest. “I’ve written him
a letter, but for all that....”</p>

<p>Mack was silent a moment. “I’ll set up
a bakery here, then,” he said. “Seeing
there’s a branch of the store already.”</p>

<p>Mack was almighty; he could do whatever
he willed. But a word from him, and
lo, a bakery on the spot!</p>

<p>“Only think of it!” cried Fruen, and
looked at him with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“You shall have your bread all right,
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Frue</i>. I’ll telegraph at once for the men
to come down. It’ll take a little time,
perhaps&mdash;a few weeks, no more.”</p>

<p>But the priest said nothing. What if his
housekeeper and all the maids baked the
bread that was needed? Bread would be
dearer now.</p>

<p>“I have to thank you for kindly allowing
me credit at the store,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in his wife, and was thoughtful
once more.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Mack. “Most natural
thing in the world. Anything you want&mdash;it’s
at your service.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must be wonderful to have such
power,” says Fruen.</p>

<p>“I’ve not as much power as I could
wish,” says Mack. “There’s that burglary,
for instance. I can’t find out who did it.”</p>

<p>“It was really too bad, that business,”
broke in the priest. “I see you have
offered a heavy reward, even to the thief
himself, and still he won’t confess.”</p>

<p>Mack shook his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s the blackest ingratitude to
steal from you,” says Fruen.</p>

<p>Mack took up the cue. “Since you
mention it, <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Frue</i>, I will say I had not
expected it. No, indeed, I had not. I
have not treated my people so badly as to
deserve it.”</p>

<p>Here the priest put in, “A thief will steal
where there is most to steal. And in this
case he knew where to go.”</p>

<p>The priest, in all innocence, had found
the very word. Mack felt easier at once.
Putting it like that made the whole thing
less of a disgrace to himself.</p>

<p>“But people are talking,” he said.
“Saying all sorts of things. It hurts my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
feelings, and might even do serious harm.
There are a number of strangers here just
now, and they are none too careful of their
words. And my daughter Elise feels it
very deeply. Well,” he said, rising to his
feet, “it will pass off in time, no doubt.
And, as I was saying, if you come across
any deserving case in the village, remember
I shall be most pleased to help.”</p>

<p>Mack took his leave. He had formed an
excellent impression of the priest and his
wife, and would put in a good word for them
wherever he could. It would do them no
harm. Though perhaps.... Who could
say to what lengths the gossip about himself
had reached already? Only yesterday his
son Frederik had come home and told how
a drunken seaman had called to him from
a boat, “Hey, when are you going to give
yourself up and get the reward?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>


<p>The days were getting warmer now;
the catches of herring had to be
left in the nets for fear of spoiling, and
could only be turned out in the cool of the
night, or when it rained. And there was
no fishing now to speak of anyway, being
already too late in the season; one or two
of the stranger boats had left. And there
was field-work to be done, and need of
all hands at home.</p>

<p>The nights too were brilliant and full of
sun. It was weather for dreams; for little
fluttering quests of the heart. Young folk
walked the roads by night, singing and
waving branches of willow. And from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
every rocky islet came the calling of birds&mdash;of
loon and gull and eider-duck. And the
seal thrust up its dripping head from the
water, looked round, and dived again down
to its own world below. Ove Rolandsen
too felt the spell; now and again he could
be heard singing or strumming in his room
of nights, and that was more than need be
looked for from a man who was no longer
a youth. And, indeed, it was not for any
meaningless delight he twanged and trolled
his songs, but rather by way of diversion,
by way of relief from his weighty thoughts.
Rolandsen is thinking deeply these days;
he is in a quandary, and must find a way
out. Jomfru van Loos, of course, had
turned up again; she was not given to
extravagant wastefulness in matters of
love, and she held now by their betrothal
as before. On the other hand, Ove
Rolandsen, as he had said, was not God;
he could not keep that heart of his within
bounds in spring. It was hard on a man
to have a betrothed who would not understand
when matters were clearly broken off
between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Rolandsen had been down to visit the
parish clerk again, and there was Olga
sitting outside the door. But there was a
deal of money about just now, with herring
at six <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Ort</i> the barrel, and Olga seemed
inclined to put on airs. Or what else
could it be? Was he, Rolandsen, the sort
of man a girl could afford to pass by?
She merely glanced up at him, and went
on with her knitting as before.</p>

<p>Said Rolandsen, “There! You looked
up. Your eyes are like arrows; they
wound a man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” said Olga.</p>

<p>“Oh! And do you suppose I understand
myself? Not in the least. I’ve lost my
senses. Here I am now, for instance,
paving the way for you to plague me
through the night that’s to come.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go away?” said
Olga.</p>

<p>“I was listening to a voice last night&mdash;a
voice within me. All unspeakable things
it said. In a word, I resolved to take a
great decision, if you think you can advise
me to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can I? I’ve nothing to do with
it.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said Rolandsen. “You’re full of
bitter words to-day. Sitting there lashing
out all the time. Talking of something else,
you’ll have that hair of yours falling off
before long. There’s too much of it.”</p>

<p>Olga was silent.</p>

<p>“Do you know Børre the organ-blower?
There’s a girl of his I could have if I cared.”</p>

<p>Olga burst out laughing at that, and
stared at him.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake don’t sit there
smiling like that. It only makes me wilder
than ever in love.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re quite mad,” says Olga softly,
flushing red.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think to myself: perhaps
she laughs up at me that way just to make
me lose my senses all the more. That’s
how they kill ducks and geese, you know,
jab them a little in the head with a knife,
and then they swell, and it makes them all
the finer.”</p>

<p>Olga answered offendedly, “I don’t do
anything of the sort; you need not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
so.” And she rose, and made as if to go
indoors.</p>

<p>“If you go now,” said Rolandsen, “I
shall only come in after you, and ask your
father if he’s read the books.”</p>

<p>“Father’s not at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t come to see him, anyway.
But you, Olga, you’re bitter and
unapproachable this day. There’s no wringing
a drop of kindness out of you. You
never heed me, you pass me by.”</p>

<p>Olga laughed again.</p>

<p>“But there’s that girl of Børre’s,” said
Rolandsen. “Her name’s Pernille. I’ve
heard them call her so myself. And her
father blows the organ at church.”</p>

<p>“Must you have a sweetheart dangling
at every finger?” asked Olga seriously.</p>

<p>“Marie van Loos is my betrothed,” he
answered. “But it’s all over between us
now. Ask her yourself. I expect she’ll be
going away soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I’m coming,” called Olga
in through the window.</p>

<p>“Your mother wasn’t calling you at all;
she only looked at you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but I know what she meant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well then! I’ll go. But look
you, Olga, you know what I mean too, only
you don’t answer me the same way, and
say, Yes, I’m coming.”</p>

<p>She opened the door. Rolandsen felt he
had abased himself; she would not think of
him now as the lordly man he was. He must
raise himself once more in her esteem. It
would never do to show himself so utterly
defeated. So he began talking of death,
and was highly humorous about it; now he
would have to die, and he didn’t care much
if he did. But he had his own ideas about
the funeral. He would make a bell himself
to ring his knell, and the clapper should be
fashioned from the thighbone of an ox,
because he had been such a fool in life.
And the funeral oration was to be the
shortest ever known; the priest to set his
foot upon the grave and simply say, “I
hereby declare you mortified, null, and void!”</p>

<p>But Olga was getting weary of all this,
and had lost her shyness now. Moreover,
she had a red ribbon at her throat, like any
lady, and the pin was altogether hidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must make her look up to me
properly,” thought Rolandsen. And he
said, “Now I did think something would
come of this. My former sweetheart, Marie
van Loos, she’s broidered and worked me
all over with initials till I’m a wonder to
see; there’s Olga Rolandsen, or what’s all
but the same, on every stitch of my things.
And I took it as a sign from Heaven. But
I must be going. My best respects....”</p>

<p>And Rolandsen waved his hat and
walked off, ending on a lordly note. Surely,
after that, it would be strange if she did not
think and wonder over him a little now.</p>

<p>What was it that had happened? Even
the parish clerk’s daughter had refused him.
Well and good! But was there not much
to indicate that it was all a sham? Why
had she been sitting outside the door at all
if it were not that she had seen him coming?
And why had she decked herself out with
red ribbons like a lady?</p>

<p>But, a few evenings later, Rolandsen’s
conceit was shattered. From his window he
saw Olga go down to Mack’s store. She
stayed there till quite late, and when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
went home, Frederik Mack and his sister
Elise walked up with her. And here, of
course, the lordly Rolandsen should have
kept calm, and merely hummed a little tune,
or drummed with his fingers carelessly, and
kept his thoughts on his work. Instead of
which, he snatched up his hat and made off
at once towards the woods. He hurried
round in a wide curve, and came out on the
road far ahead of the three. Then he
stopped to get his breath, and walked down
to meet them.</p>

<p>But the three took an unreasonable time;
Rolandsen could neither hear nor see them.
He whistled and trolled a bit of a song, as
if they might sit somewhere in the woods
and watch him. At last he saw them
coming, walking slowly, dawdling unpardonably,
seeing it was late at night, and they
should have been hurrying towards their
respective homes. Rolandsen, great man,
walks towards them, with a long stalk of
grass in his mouth and a sprig of willow in
his buttonhole; the two men raised their
hats as they came up, and the ladies
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“You look warm,” said Frederik.
“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>Rolandsen answered over his shoulder,
“It’s spring-time; I’m walking in the
spring.”</p>

<p>No nonsense this time, but clean firmness
and confidence. Ho! but he had walked
past them with an air&mdash;slowly, carelessly,
all unperturbed; he had even found strength
to measure Elise Mack with a downward
glance. But no sooner had they passed out
of sight than he slipped aside into the wood,
no longer great at all, but abject. Olga was
a creature of no importance now; and at the
thought of it, he took the agate pin from his
pocket, broke it up thoroughly, and threw
it away. But now there was Elise, Mack’s
daughter Elise, tall and brown, and showing
her white teeth a little when she smiled.
Elise it was whom God had led across his
path. She had not said a word, and to-morrow,
perhaps, she would be going away
again. All hope gone.</p>

<p>Well and good....</p>

<p>But on coming back to the telegraph
station, there was Jomfru van Loos waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for him. Once before he had reminded her
that past was past, and what was done was
over; she had much better go away and live
somewhere else. And Jomfru van Loos
had answered that he should not have to ask
her twice&mdash;good-bye! But now here she
was again, waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Here’s that tobacco pouch I promised
you,” she said. “Here it is, if you’re not
too proud.”</p>

<p>He did not take it, but answered, “A
tobacco pouch? I never use that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” said she, and drew back
her hand.</p>

<p>And he forced himself to soften her again.
“It can’t be me you promised it. Think
again; perhaps it was the priest. And he’s
a married man.”</p>

<p>She did not understand that the slight jest
had cost him some effort, and she could not
refrain from answering in turn, “I saw the
ladies up along the road; I suppose that’s
where you’ve been, trailing after them?”</p>

<p>“And what’s that to do with you?”</p>

<p>“Ove!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you go away somewhere else?
You can see for yourself it’s no good going
on like this.”</p>

<p>“It would be all right as ever, if only you
weren’t such a jewel to go flaunting about
with all the womenfolk.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to drive me out of my
wits?” he cried. “Good-night!”</p>

<p>Jomfru van Loos called after him, “Ho,
yes, you are a nice one, indeed! There’s
this and that I’ve heard about you!”</p>

<p>Now was there any sense at all in being
so desperately particular? And couldn’t a
poor soul have a little genuine heartache to
bear with into the bargain? The end of it
was, that Rolandsen went into the office,
straight to the instrument, called up the
station at Rosengaard, and asked his colleague
there to send him half a keg of cognac with
the next consignment coming down. There
was no sense in going on like this for ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>


<p>Elise Mack stays some little while at
the factory this time. She has left the
big house at Rosengaard and come out here
wholly and solely to make things a little
comfortable for her father during his stay.
She would hardly set her foot in the village
at all if she could avoid it.</p>

<p>Elise Mack was growing more and more
of a fine lady; she wore red and white and
yellow gowns, and people were beginning to
call her <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Frøken</i>, though her father was
neither priest nor doctor. A sun and a star
she was above all others.</p>

<p>She came to the station with some
telegrams to be sent; Rolandsen received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
her. He said nothing beyond the few words
needed, and did not make the mistake of
nodding as to an acquaintance and asking
how she was. Not a single mistake did he
make.</p>

<p>“It says ‘ostrich feathers’ twice in this.
I don’t know if it’s meant to be that
way.”</p>

<p>“Twice?” said she. “Let me look. Oh
no, of course not; you’re quite right. Lend
me a pen, would you mind?”</p>

<p>She took off her glove, and went on
speaking as she wrote. “And that’s to
a merchant in town; he’d have laughed
at me ever so. There, it’s all right now,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Quite right now.”</p>

<p>“And so you’re still here?” she said,
keeping her seat. “Year after year and I
find you here.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen had his reasons, no doubt, for
staying on at this little station instead of
applying for a better post. There must be
something that held him to the place, year
after year.</p>

<p>“Must be somewhere,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“You might come to Rosengaard. That’s
better than here, surely?”</p>

<p>The faintest little blush spread over her
cheeks as she spoke; perhaps she would
rather have left that unsaid.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t give me a big station
like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I suppose you are rather
too young.”</p>

<p>“It is kind of you, anyhow, to think it’s
because of that.”</p>

<p>“If you came over to us, now, there’s
more society. The Doctor’s next door, and
the cashier, and all the assistants from the
store. And there are always some queer
people coming in&mdash;sea-captains, you know,
and that sort.”</p>

<p>“Captain Henriksen of the coasting
steamer,” thought Rolandsen to himself.</p>

<p>But what was the meaning of all this
graciousness coming so suddenly? Was
Rolandsen another man to-day than yesterday?
He knew well enough that he was
utterly and entirely hopeless in this foolish
love of his; there was no more to be said.
She gave him her hand as she rose to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and that without first putting on her glove.
There was a rustle of silk as she swept down
the steps.</p>

<p>Rolandsen drew up to the table, a threadbare,
stooping figure, and sent off the wires.
His breast was a whirl of strange feelings.
All things considered, he was not so
desperately off after all; the invention might
bring in a heavy sum if only he could first
get hold of three hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>. He was
a bankrupt millionaire. But surely he must
be able to find some way....</p>

<p>The <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Præstefruen</i> came in, with a telegram
to her people. Rolandsen had gathered
courage from the previous visit. He no
longer felt himself as an insignificant next-to-nothing,
but the equal of other great
men; he talked to Fruen a little, just a word
or so in the ordinary way. And Fruen, on
her part, stayed somewhat longer than was
strictly necessary, and asked him to look in
at the Vicarage any time.</p>

<p>That evening he met her again, Fruen
herself, on the road just below the station.
And she did not hurry away, but stayed
talking a little while. It could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
be displeasing to her, since she stayed
so.</p>

<p>“You play the guitar, I think,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes. If you like to wait a little, I’ll
show you how well I can play.”</p>

<p>And he went inside to fetch his guitar.</p>

<p>Fruen waited. It could not be altogether
displeasing to her, since she waited so.</p>

<p>And Rolandsen sang for her, of his true
love and his heart’s delight; and the songs
were nothing wonderful, but his voice was
fine and full. Rolandsen had a purpose of
his own in thus keeping her there in the
middle of the road; there was every chance
that someone might come walking by about
that time. Such things had happened
before. And if Fruen had been pressed for
time, it would have been awkward for her
now; they fell to talking again, and stayed
talking some time. This Rolandsen spoke
in a way of his own, altogether different
from her husband’s manner, as if it were
from some other part of the world. And
when he rolled out his most magnificent
phrases, her eyes rounded wide as those of
a listening child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, God be with you”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> she said at
last, turning to go.</p>

<p>“So He is, I’m sure,” answered Rolandsen.</p>

<p>She started. “Are you sure of that?
How?”</p>

<p>“Well, He’s every reason to be. He’s
Lord of all creation, I know, but I shouldn’t
think there’s anything much in being just
a God of beasts and mountains. After all,
it’s us human beings that make Him
what He is. So why shouldn’t He be
with us?”</p>

<p>And, having delivered himself of this
striking speech, Rolandsen looked extremely
pleased with himself. Fruen wondered at
him greatly as she walked away. Ho-ho!
’Twas not for nothing that the knob of a
head he bore on his shoulders had devised a
great invention.</p>

<p>But now the cognac had come. Rolandsen
had carried the keg up from the wharf
himself; he went no back-ways round with
his burden, but carried it openly under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
powerful arm in broad daylight. So unafraid
was he at heart. And then came a
time when Rolandsen found comfort for all
distress. And there were nights when he
turned out and made himself regent and
master of all roads and ways; he cleared
them bare, and made them impassable
for stranger men from the boats, coming
ashore on their lawful errands, in search of
petticoats.</p>

<p>One Sunday a boat’s crew appeared at
church, all reasonably drunk. After the
service they sauntered up and down the
road, instead of going on board; they had a
supply of <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Brændevin</i> with them, and drank
themselves ever more boisterous, to the
annoyance of those passing by. The priest
himself had come up to reprove them, but
without effect; later, the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i> himself
came up, and he wore a gold-laced cap.
Some of them went on board after that, but
three of them&mdash;Big Ulrik was one&mdash;refused
to budge. They had come ashore, they
said, and were going to let folk know it; as
for the girls, they were their girls for now.
Ulrik was with them, and Ulrik was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
well known from Lofoten to Finmarken.
Come on then!</p>

<p>A number of people from the village had
gathered about, farther off along the road,
or in among the trees, as their courage
permitted. They glanced with some concern
at Big Ulrik swaggering about.</p>

<p>“I must ask you men to go on board
again,” said the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>. “If you don’t,
I’ll have to talk to you after another
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Go along home, you and your cap,” said
Ulrik.</p>

<p>The <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i> was thinking already of
getting help, and tying up the madman out
of harm’s way.</p>

<p>“And you’d better be careful how you
defy me when I’m in uniform,” says the
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>.</p>

<p>Ulrik and his fellows laughed at this till
they had to hold their ribs. A fisher-lad
ventured boldly past; one of them struck
him a <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Skalle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and drew blood. “Now for
the next,” cried Ulrik.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>“A rope,” cried the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>, at sight of
the blood. “Bring a rope, some of you, and
help me take him.”</p>

<p>“How many are there of you?” asked
Ulrik the invincible. And the three doughty
ones laughed and gasped again.</p>

<p>But now came Big Rolandsen up along
the road, walking with a soft, gliding step,
and his eyes staring stiffly. He was on his
usual round. He greeted the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>,
and stopped.</p>

<p>“Here’s Rolandsen,” cried Ulrik. “Ho,
boys, look at him!”</p>

<p>“He’s dangerous,” said the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>.
“He’s drawn blood from one already. We
shall have to rope him.”</p>

<p>“Rope him?”</p>

<p>The <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i> nodded. “Yes. I won’t
stand any more of this.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Rolandsen. “What do
you want with a rope? You leave me to
tackle him.”</p>

<p>Ulrik stepped closer, made pretence to
lift his hand in greeting, and gave Rolandsen
a slight blow. He felt, no doubt, that he
had struck something firm and solid, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
drew back, but kept on shouting defiantly,
“<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Goddag</i>, Telegraph-Rolandsen! And
there’s your name and titles for all to
hear.”</p>

<p>After that, it seemed as if nothing would
happen. Rolandsen was not inclined to let
slip the chance of a fight, and it annoyed
him that he was so miserably slow to anger,
and had not returned the first blow. He
had to begin now by answering the other’s
taunts, in order to keep matters going.
They fooled about a little, talking drunken-fashion,
and each boasting of what he would
do to the other. When one invited the
other to come on, and he would give him a
dose of olive oil enough to last him, etcetera,
the other answered, right, he would come
on sure enough as soon as anyone else did,
and provide sufficient laying on of hands by
return. And the crowd around them found
these interchanges creditable to both sides.
But the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i>, watching, could see how
wrath was growing and flourishing up in
Rolandsen’s mind; Rolandsen was smiling
all the time as he talked.</p>

<p>Then Ulrik flicked him under the nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and at that Rolandsen was in the proper mood
at once; he shot out one swift hand and
gripped the other’s coat. But the stuff gave
way, and there was nothing very grand in
ripping up a duffle jacket. Rolandsen made
a spring forward, showing his teeth in a
satisfied grimace. And then things began
to happen.</p>

<p>Ulrik tried a <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Skalle</i>, and Rolandsen
was thenceforward aware of his opponent’s
speciality. But Rolandsen was past-master
in another effective method&mdash;the long, swinging,
flat-handed cut delivered edgeways at
the jawbone; the blow should fall just on
the side of the chin. A blow of this sort
shakes up a man most adequately; his head
whirls, and down he comes with a crash.
It breaks no bones, and draws no blood
save for a tiny trickle from the nose and
mouth. The stricken one is in no hurry
to move.</p>

<p>Suddenly Big Ulrik has it, and down he
comes, staggering and falling beyond the
edge of the road. His legs tangled crosswise
under him and collapsed as if dead;
faintness overpowered him. And Rolandsen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was well enough up in the slang of the
brawl. “Now for the next,” he said at
once. He seemed thoroughly pleased with
himself, and never heeded that his shirt
was torn open at the throat.</p>

<p>But the next one was two, being Ulrik’s
fellow-rascals both; quiet and wondering
they were now, and no longer holding their
ribs in an ache of laughter.</p>

<p>“You! You’re children,” cried Rolandsen
to the pair. “But if you want to be
crumpled up....”</p>

<p>The <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i> intervened, and talked the
two disturbers to their senses; they had
better pick up their comrade and help him
on board then and there. “I’m in your
debt,” he said to Rolandsen.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen, watching the three desperadoes
as they moved off down the road,
was far from satisfied yet. He shouted
after them as long as they could hear,
“Come again to-morrow! Smash a window
down at the station and I’ll know. Huh!
Children!”</p>

<p>As usual he did not know when to stop,
but went on with his boastful talk. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
crowd was moving away. Suddenly a lady
comes up, looks at him with glistening eyes,
and offers her hand. <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Præstefruen</i> and no
other. She too has seen the fight.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was splendid!” she says. “I’m
sure he won’t forget it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>She noticed that his shirt was open.
The sun had browned a ring about his
neck, but he was naked and white
below.</p>

<p>He pulls his shirt together and bows.
It was by no means unwelcome to be accosted
thus by the chaplain’s lady in sight
of all; the victor of that battle feels himself
elated, he can afford to speak kindly for a
moment to this slip of a child that she is.
Poor lady, her shoes were none too impressive,
and it was but little homage or deference
any paid to her there!</p>

<p>“’Tis misusing such eyes to trouble them
looking at me,” said he.</p>

<p>Whereat she blushed.</p>

<p>He asked her again, “Don’t you miss
things, living away from town?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” she answered. “It’s nice
living here too. But look here, wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
you care to walk up and spend the day with
us now?”</p>

<p>Rolandsen thanked her, and was sorry
he could not. Sunday or Monday, it was
all one to the telegraph station. “But I
thank you all the same,” he said. “There’s
one thing I envy the priest, and that is
you.”</p>

<p>“What do you...?”</p>

<p>“Politely, but firmly, I envy him his
wife.”</p>

<p>There&mdash;he had done it now. Surely it
would be hard to find the like of Ove Rolandsen
for shedding little joys abroad.</p>

<p>“What ridiculous things you do say,”
said Fruen, when she had recovered herself
a little.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen, walking back homeward,
reflected that, taking it all round, he had had
a nice day. In his intoxication and triumph
he dwelt on the fact that this young wife,
the priest’s wife, was so inclined to stop and
talk with him at times. He formed his own
ideas about it, and grew cunning, ay, he
began already to plot and plan. Why
should not Fruen herself get rid of Jomfru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
van Loos for him, and file through his
fetters? He could not ask it of her directly,
no&mdash;but there were other ways. Who
could say? Perhaps she would do him that
service, since they were such good friends.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>


<p>The priest and his lady are awakened
in the night; wakened by song. No
such thing had ever happened to them
before, but here it was; somebody singing
outside the house down below. The sun
looks out over the world; the gulls are
awake; it is three in the morning.</p>

<p>“Surely there’s someone singing,” says
the priest to his wife in the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s here, outside my window,” says
she.</p>

<p>Fruen listened. She knew the voice&mdash;wild
Rolandsen’s voice it was, and his guitar.
Oh, but it was too bad of him really, to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
singing of his “true love” right underneath
her window. She felt hot all over.</p>

<p>Her husband came in to look. “It’s that
man Rolandsen,” he said, and frowned.
“He’s had a keg of brandy sent just lately.
Disgraceful!”</p>

<p>But Fruen was not inclined to frown
upon this little diversion; he was quite a
nice young fellow really, this Rolandsen,
who could fight like any rough, and sing
like a youth inspired. He brought a touch
of mild excitement into the quiet, everyday
life of the place.</p>

<p>“It’s meant to be a serenade, I suppose,”
she said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“He’s no business to be serenading you,”
said her husband. “I don’t know what you
think of it yourself?”</p>

<p>Oh, but of course he must be nasty
about it! “There’s no harm in it, surely,”
said his wife. “It’s only his fun.” But
at the same time she resolved never again
to make beautiful eyes at Rolandsen and
lead him on to escapades of this sort.</p>

<p>“He’s beginning again, as sure as I’m
here,” cried the priest. And he stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
forward to the window then and there, and
rapped on the pane.</p>

<p>Rolandsen looked up. It was the priest
himself standing there in the flesh. The
song died away. Rolandsen collapsed,
stood a moment hesitating, and walked
away.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the priest. “I soon got rid
of him.” He was by no means displeased
to have accomplished so much by merely
showing himself. “And he shall have a
letter from me to-morrow,” he went on.
“I’ve had my eye on him for some time
past, for his scandalous goings-on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think if I spoke to him
myself,” said his wife, “and told him not
to come up here singing songs in the middle
of the night?”</p>

<p>But the priest went on without heeding.
“Write him a letter, yes.... And then
I’ll go and talk to him after.” As if his
going and talking to Rolandsen after meant
something very serious indeed.</p>

<p>He went back to his own room, and lay
thinking it all over. No, he would endure
it no longer; the fellow’s conceit, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
extravagant ways, were becoming a
nuisance to the place. The priest was
no respecter of persons; he wrote his
epistles to one as to another, and made
himself feared. If the congregation
stumbled in their darkness, it was his
business to bring light. He had not forgotten
that business with Levion’s sister.
She had not mended her ways, and the
priest had been unable to retain her brother
as lay-helper. Ill-fortune had come upon
Levion; his wife had died. But the priest
lost no time; he spoke to Levion at the
funeral. It was an abominable business.
Levion, simple soul, setting out to bury his
helpmeet, recollected that he had promised
to bring up a newly slaughtered calf to
Frederik Mack at the factory. It was all
on the way, and with the hot weather it
would not do to leave the meat over-long.
What more natural than that he should take
the carcase with him? The priest learned
the story from Enok, the humble person
with the permanent earache. And he sent
for Levion at once.</p>

<p>“I cannot retain you as lay-helper,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
said. “Your sister is living a sinful life
within your gates; your house is a house
of ill-fame; you lie there fast asleep at night
and let men come in.”</p>

<p>“Ay, more’s the pity,” says Levion. “I’ll
not deny it’s been that way more than once.”</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing. You follow
your wife to the grave, and drag a dead
calf along after her. Now I ask you, is that
right or decent?”</p>

<p>But Levion, fisherman-peasant, found such
niceties beyond him; he stared uncomprehendingly
at the priest. His wife had
always been a thrifty soul; she would have
been the first to remind him herself to take
the calf along if she could have spoken.
“Seeing it’s up that way,” she would have
said.</p>

<p>“If as Pastor’s going to be so niggling
particular,” said Levion, “you’ll never get
a decent helper anywhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” said the priest.
“Anyhow, you are dismissed.”</p>

<p>Levion looked down at his sou’wester.
It was a blow to him and a disgrace; his
neighbours would rejoice at his fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>But the priest had not finished yet. “For
Heaven’s sake,” he said, “can’t you get that
sister of yours married to the man?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I haven’t tried?” said
Levion. “But the worst of it is, she’s not
quite sure which one it is.”</p>

<p>The priest looked at him open-mouthed.
“Not quite <em>what</em> did you say?” And then
at last, realising what it meant, he clasped
his hands. “Well, well!... I must find
another helper, that is all.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll it be?”</p>

<p>“That’s no concern of yours. As a
matter of fact, I am taking Enok.”</p>

<p>Levion stood thoughtful for quite a
while. He knew this Enok, and had an
old account to settle with him. “Enok, is
it?” he said, and went out.</p>

<p>Enok was certainly a good man for the
post. He was one of your deep-thinking
sort, and did not carry his head in the air,
but bowed on his breast; an earnest man.
It was whispered that he was no good man
to share with in a boat; there was some
story of his having been caught, many years
back, pulling up other folk’s lines. But this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
no doubt, was pure envy and malice. There
was nothing lordly or baronial about him in
the way of looks; that everlasting kerchief
round his ears did not improve him. Moreover,
he had a way of blowing through his
nostrils; on meeting anyone, he would lay
a finger first on one side and blow, then on
the other side, and blow again. But the
Lord took no account of outward things, and
Enok, His humble servant, had doubtless
no other thought with this beyond smartening
himself up a little on meeting with his
fellows. When he came up he would say,
“<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Freden!</i>” and when he went away, “<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Bliv i
Freden</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Sound and thoughtful, an earnest
man. Even his <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">tollekniv</i>, the big knife at
his belt, he seemed to wear with thankfulness,
as who should say, “Alas, there’s
many that haven’t so much as a knife to cut
with in the world.” Only last Offering,
Enok had created a sensation by the
amount of his gift; he had laid a note on
the altar. Had he been doing so well of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
late in ready cash? Doubtless some higher
power must have added its mite to his
savings. He owed nothing in Mack’s
books at the store; his fish-loft was
untouched, his family were decently clad.
And Enok ruled his house with strictness
and propriety. He had a son, a very model
of quiet and decorous behaviour. The lad
had been out with the fishing fleet from
Lofoten, and earned the right to come
home with a blue anchor on his hand, but
this he did not. His father had instructed
him early in humility and the fear of God.
It was a blessed thing, in Enok’s mind, to
walk humbly and meekly....</p>

<p>The priest lay thinking over these things,
and the morning wore on. That miserable
Rolandsen had spoiled his night’s rest; he
got up at six, which was all too early. But
then it appeared that his wife had already
dressed and gone out without a sound.</p>

<p>During the forenoon Fruen walked in to
Rolandsen and said, “You must not come
up like that and sing songs outside at
night.”</p>

<p>“I know; it was wrong of me,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“I thought Jomfru van Loos would be
there, but she had moved.”</p>

<p>“Oh!... So it was for her you sang?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A poor little bit of a song to greet
the day.”</p>

<p>“That was my room,” said she.</p>

<p>“It used to be Jomfruen’s room in the
old priest’s time.”</p>

<p>Fruen said no more; her eyes had turned
dull and stupid.</p>

<p>“Well, thanks,” she said, as she went.
“It was very nice, I’m sure, but don’t do it
again.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I promise.... If I’d known
... of course, I wouldn’t have dared....”
Rolandsen looked utterly crushed.</p>

<p>When Fruen came home she said,
“Really I’m so sleepy to-day.”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” said her husband. “You
got no sleep last night, with that fellow
shouting down there.”</p>

<p>“I think Jomfru van Loos had better go,”
said she.</p>

<p>“Jomfru van Loos?”</p>

<p>“He’s engaged to her, you know. And
we shall have no peace at night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll send him a letter to-day!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be simpler just to send her
away?”</p>

<p>The priest thought to himself that this
was by no means the simplest way, seeing
it would mean further expense for a new
housekeeper. Moreover, Jomfru van Loos
was very useful; without her, there would
be no sort of order anywhere. He remembered
how things had been managed
at first, when his wife looked after the house
herself&mdash;he was not likely to forget it.</p>

<p>“Whom will you get in her place?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I would rather do her work myself,” she
answered.</p>

<p>At that he laughed bitterly, and said,
“A nice mess you will make of it.”</p>

<p>But his wife was hurt and offended at this.
“I can’t see,” she said, “but that I must
look after the house in any case. So the
work a housekeeper did would not make
much difference.”</p>

<p>The priest was silent. It was no use
discussing it further, no earthly use&mdash;no.
“We can’t send her away,” he said. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
there was his wife with her shoes all sorely
cracked and worn, pitiful to see. And he
said as he went out, “We must manage
to get you a new pair of shoes, and that
soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s summer now,” she answered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>


<p>The last of the fishing-boats are ready
to sail; the season is over. But the
sea was still rich; herring were sighted
along the coast, and prices fell. Trader
Mack had bought up what fish he could get,
and none had heard of any stoppage in his
payments; only the last boat he had asked to
wait while he telegraphed south for money.
But at that folk had begun whispering
at once. Mack was in difficulties....
Aha!</p>

<p>But Trader Mack was as all-powerful as
ever. In the thick of all his other business
he had promised the Vicarage people a
bakery. Good! The bakery was getting on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the workmen had arrived, and the foundation
was already laid. Fruen found it a real
pleasure to go and watch her bakery growing
up. But now the building-work was to
commence, and this was a matter for other
workmen; they had been telegraphed for
too, said Mack.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, the baker at the
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmandsgaard</i> had pulled himself together.
What a letter from the priest had failed to
accomplish, was effected by Mack with his
foundation. “If it’s bread they want, why,
they shall have it,” said the baker. But
everyone understood that the poor man was
only writhing helplessly; he would be
crushed now, crushed by Mack.</p>

<p>Rolandsen sits in his room drawing up a
curious announcement, with his signature.
He reads it over again and again, and
approves it. Then he puts it in his pocket,
takes his hat, and goes out. He took the
road down to Mack’s office at the factory.</p>

<p>Rolandsen had been expecting Jomfru van
Loos to go away, but she had not gone;
her mistress had not dismissed her at all.
Rolandsen had been out in his reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
when he hoped that Fruen would do him
favours. He came to his reasonable senses
again, and thought to himself, Let’s keep
to earth now; we haven’t made such an
impression after all, it seems.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had received a
letter of serious and chastening content from
the priest himself. Rolandsen did not
attempt to hide the fact that this thing had
happened to him; he told the matter to all,
to high and low. It was no more than he
deserved, he said, and it had done him
good; no priest had ever troubled about him
before since his confirmation. Rolandsen
would even venture to say that the priest
ought to send many such letters out among
his flock, to the better comfort and guidance
of all.</p>

<p>But no one could see from Rolandsen’s
manner that he had been any way rejoiced
or comforted of late; on the contrary, he
appeared more thoughtful than ever, and
seemed to be occupied with some particular
thought. Shall I, or shall I not? he might
be heard to murmur. And now, this
morning, when his former betrothed, Jomfru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
van Loos, had lain in wait for him and
plagued the life out of him again with that
ridiculous business of the serenade, he had
left her with the significant words, “I’ll
do it!”</p>

<p>Rolandsen walks into Mack’s office and
gives greeting. He is perfectly sober. The
Macks, father and son, are standing, each at
one side of the desk, writing. Old Mack
offers him a chair, but Rolandsen does not
sit. He says:</p>

<p>“I only came in to say it was me that
broke in and took the money.”</p>

<p>Father and son stare at him.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to give myself up,” says
Rolandsen. “It would not be right to hide
it any longer; ’tis bad enough as it is.”</p>

<p>“Leave us alone a minute,” says Old
Mack.</p>

<p>Frederik walks out.</p>

<p>Says Mack, “Are you in your right
senses to-day?”</p>

<p>“I did it, I tell you,” shouts Rolandsen.
And Rolandsen’s voice was a voice for song
and strong words.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. Mack blinked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his eyes, and looked thoughtful. “You did
it, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mack thought again. That good brain
of his had solved many a problem in its
day; he was well used to settling a matter
quickly.</p>

<p>“And will you hold by your words to-morrow
as well?”</p>

<p>“Yes. From henceforth I will not conceal
it. I have had a letter from the priest,
and it’s that has changed me.”</p>

<p>Was Mack beginning to believe him?
Or was it merely as a matter of form that
he went on?</p>

<p>“When did you do it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Rolandsen mentioned the night.</p>

<p>“And how did you go about it?”</p>

<p>Rolandsen described it all in detail.</p>

<p>“There were some papers in the chest
with the money&mdash;did you notice them?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There were some papers.”</p>

<p>“One of them is missing; what have you
done with it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got it. A paper? No.”</p>

<p>“My life insurance policy, it was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“An insurance policy! Yes, now I
remember. I must confess I burnt it.”</p>

<p>“Did you? Then you ought not to have
done so. It’s cost me a lot of trouble to get
another.”</p>

<p>Said Rolandsen, “I was all in a flurry,
and didn’t think. I beg you to forgive me.”</p>

<p>“There was another chest with several
thousand <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> in it; why didn’t you take
that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t find that one.”</p>

<p>Mack had finished his calculations.
Whether Rolandsen had committed the
burglary or not, he would in any case make
the finest culprit Mack could have wished.
He would certainly make no secret of the
affair, but rather declare it to every soul he
met; the last boat’s crew would carry the
news with them home, and so it would come
to the ears of the traders along the coast.
Mack felt he was saved.</p>

<p>“I have never heard of your going about
and ... your having this weakness before,”
he said.</p>

<p>Whereto Rolandsen answered, No, not
among the fishermen, no. When he wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to steal, he didn’t go bird-nesting in that
petty fashion; he went to the bank itself.</p>

<p>That was one for Mack! He only
answered now with a reproachful air, “But
that you could steal from <em>me</em>....”</p>

<p>Rolandsen said, “I worked myself up to
it, to be bold enough. I was drunk at the
time, I am sorry to say.”</p>

<p>After this it seemed no longer impossible
that the confession was true. Rolandsen
was known to be a wild fellow who led an
extravagant life and had no great income
to draw upon. That keg of brandy from
Rosengaard must have cost him something.</p>

<p>“And I’ve more to confess, I’m sorry to
say,” went on Rolandsen. “I haven’t the
money now, to pay it back.”</p>

<p>Mack looked highly indifferent. “That
doesn’t matter in the least,” he said. “The
thing that troubles me is all the stupid gossip
it’s led to. All those unpleasant insinuations
against me and my family.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that. And I was going
to do something....”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Take down your placard from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Vicarage gate and put up one of my own in
its place.”</p>

<p>This was Rolandsen all over. “No,” said
Mack. “I won’t ask you to do that. It will
be hard enough for you as it is, my good
man. But you might write a declaration
here.” And Mack nodded towards Frederik’s
seat.</p>

<p>Rolandsen set to work. Mack was thinking
deeply the while. Here was all this
serious business turning out for the best. It
would cost him something, but the money
would be well spent; his renown would now
be spread far and wide.</p>

<p>Mack read over the declaration, and said,
“Yes, that’s good enough. I don’t intend
to make use of it, of course....”</p>

<p>“That’s as you please,” said Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“And I do not propose to say anything
about our interview to-day. It can remain
between ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to tell people myself,”
said Rolandsen. “The priest’s letter said
particularly that we should confess.”</p>

<p>Mack opened his fire-proof safe and took
out a bundle of notes. Here was his chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to show what sort of man he was. And who
could know that a master seiner from a
stranger boat was down in the bay waiting
for those very notes before he could
sail?</p>

<p>Mack counted out four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>,
and said, “I don’t mean to insult you, but
it’s my way to keep to my word. I have
promised a reward of four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>,
which is now due to you.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen walked towards the door. “I
deserve your contempt,” said he.</p>

<p>“Contempt!” said Mack. “Let me tell
you....”</p>

<p>“Your generosity cuts me to the heart.
Instead of putting me in prison, you reward
me....”</p>

<p>But it was a mere trifle for Mack to lose
a couple of hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> over a burglary.
It was only when he rewarded the thief
himself with twice that amount that the
thing became really magnificent. He said,
“Look here, Rolandsen, you will find yourself
in difficulties now; you will lose your place
to begin with. The money will be no inconvenience
to me, but it may be of real im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>portance
to you just now. I beg you to
think over what I say.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it,” said Rolandsen.</p>

<p>Mack took the notes and thrust them into
Rolandsen’s pocket.</p>

<p>“Let it be a loan, then,” said Rolandsen
humbly.</p>

<p>And this chivalrous merchant-prince
agreed, and answered, “Very well, then,
as a loan.” But he knew in his heart that
he would never see the money again.</p>

<p>Rolandsen stood there looking as if
weighed down by the heaviest burden in
life. It was a pitiful sight.</p>

<p>“And now make haste and right yourself
again,” said Mack encouragingly. “You’ve
made a bad slip, but it’s never too late, you
know.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen thanked him with the greatest
humility, and went out.</p>

<p>“I am a thief,” he said to the factory girls
as he went out, making a beginning with
them without delay. And he gave them his
full confession.</p>

<p>Then he went up to the Vicarage gate,
and tore down Mack’s notice, setting up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
own instead. There it was in black and
white, setting forth that he, Rolandsen, and
no other, was the culprit. And to-morrow
would be Sunday; many church-goers would
pass by the spot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>


<p>Rolandsen seemed to be picking up
again to a marked degree. After all
the village had read his declaration, he kept
to himself, and avoided people. This made
a good impression; evidently the scapegrace
had taken thought, and turned aside from
his evil ways. But the fact was that
Rolandsen had no time for sauntering idly
about the roads now; he was restlessly at
work in his room at nights. There were
numbers of bottles, large and small, containing
samples, that he had to pack up and
send away by post east and west. Also, he
was at the instrument early and late; it was
essential to make the best of his time before
he was dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>His scandalous story had also reached the
Vicarage, and everyone looked with commiseration
upon Jomfru van Loos, whose
former lover had turned out so badly. The
priest himself called her into his study and
talked to her gently for a long time.</p>

<p>Jomfru van Loos was certainly not now
disposed to hold Rolandsen to his word; she
would go and see him once more, and make
an end of it.</p>

<p>She found him looking abject and miserable,
but this did not soften her. “Nice things
you’ve been doing,” said she.</p>

<p>“I hoped you would come, so I could ask
pardon,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Pardon! Well, I never did! Look
you here, Ove! I simply don’t know what
to make of you. And I’ll have no more to
do with you on this earth, so there. I’m not
known to folk as a thief nor a rascal, but go
my own honest way. And haven’t I warned
you faithfully from my heart, and you’ve
only gone on as bad as ever? A man
already promised and betrothed, going about
as a costly jewel to other womenfolk? And
then to go stealing people’s money and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to stick up a confession on a gatepost in
broad daylight. I’m that shamed I don’t
know what to do with myself. Don’t say a
word; I know all about you. You’ve nothing
to say at all but only harden your heart and
shout, Hurray, my boys! And it’s all been
true affection on my part, but you’ve been as
a very leper towards me, and soiled my life
with a disgraceful burglary. You needn’t
try to say a word, and only make it worse.
Praise be the Lord, there’s not a soul but
says the same&mdash;how you’ve shamefully
deceived me. And the priest himself says
I’d better give you up and go away at once,
though he’d be sorry to lose me. And it’s
no good you standing there trying to hide,
Ove, seeing you’re a sinner in the sight of
God and man, and only worthy to be cast
aside. And if I do call you Ove, after all
that’s passed, I don’t mean it a bit, and you
needn’t think I’m going to make it up with
you, because I’m not, for I won’t have
anything to do with you here or hereafter,
and never be a friend of yours in all the
world. For there’s nobody could have done
more for you than I’ve done this long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
back, but you’ve only been overflowing with
recklessness and never a thought of me,
and taking advantage of me early and late.
Though I’m sure it’s partly my own fault,
and more’s the pity, by reason of being too
lenient and overlooking this and that all the
time.”</p>

<p>There stood Rolandsen, a wretched
creature, with never a word to say for himself.
He had never heard Marie van Loos so
incoherent as to-day; it showed how his dire
misdeed had shaken her. When she stopped
speaking, she seemed thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<p>“I’ll turn over a new leaf,” he said.</p>

<p>“You? A new leaf?” Jomfru van Loos
laughed bitterly. “What’s done is done,
and will be for all your turning. And
seeing I’m come of decent folk myself, I’ll
not have you smirching my good name.
When I say a thing, I mean it. And I tell
you now, I’m going away by the post-packet
the day after to-morrow; but I’m not going
to have you coming down to the quay saying
good-bye, and the priest he says the same.
I’ll say good-bye to you to-day and once and
for all. And thanks for the happy hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we’ve had together&mdash;the rest I’ll try to
forget.”</p>

<p>She swung round determinedly and walked
away. Then she said, “But you can be up
in the woods just above, if you like, and
wave good-bye from there&mdash;not that I care
if you do or don’t.”</p>

<p>“You might shake hands,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t. You know only too well
what your right hand doeth.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen stood bowed and downcast.
“But aren’t we to write?” he said. “Only
just a word or so?”</p>

<p>“I won’t write. Never on earth. You’ve
said often enough it was all over between us,
and made a joke of it; but now I’m good
enough, it seems. But I know better! It’s
good-bye for ever, and I wish you joy. I’m
going to Bergen, to stay with father, and
you know the address if you write. But I
won’t ask you to.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen went up the steps to his room
with a very clear sensation of being
betrothed no longer. “Curious thing,” he
thought to himself, “I was standing down
there outside a moment ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a busy day; he had to pack up
the last of his samples ready to go by the
post-packet the day after to-morrow; then
he had to collect his own belongings and
prepare for the moving. The all-powerful
Inspector of the Telegraphs was on the way.</p>

<p>Of course he would be summarily dismissed.
There was nothing to be said
against him in respect of his duties, and
Trader Mack, a man of great influence,
would doubtless do nothing to harm him,
but for all that, justice must be done.</p>

<p>There was grass in the meadows now,
and the woods were in leaf; the nights were
mild and calm. The bay was deserted, all
the fishing-boats were gone, and Mack’s own
vessels had sailed away to the southward
with their cargoes of herring. It was
summer.</p>

<p>The fine days gave good attendance at the
church on Sundays; crowds of people came
by land and water, and among them a few
skippers from Bergen and Haugesund, who
had their craft out along the coast, drying
split fish on the rocks. They came again
year after year, and grew old in the place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
They turned up at church in full dress, with
bright calico shirts and chains of hair down
over their chests; some of them even wore
gold earrings, and brightened up the assembly.
But the dry weather brought news of a
regrettable forest fire farther up the fjords;
summer weather was not all for the good.</p>

<p>Enok had entered upon his office, and
was lay-helper now in earnestness and all
humility, with a kerchief over his ears. The
youth of the village found great amusement
in the sight, but their elders were inclined
to be scandalised at having the choir disgraced
by monkey figures of the sort, and
sent in a complaint to the priest about it.
Could not Enok manage with stuffing
wadding in his ears? But Enok explained
to the priest that he could not put away the
kerchief by reason of the aches and pains
that raged tumultuously within. Then it was
that ex-Lay-helper Levion set up a malicious
laughter at his supplanter Enok, and opined
that it was hot enough for most these days
without tying kerchiefs round their ears.</p>

<p>Levion, unworthy soul, had, since his downfall,
never ceased from persecuting Enok with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
jealousy and ill-will. Never a night he was
out spearing flounder but he must choose his
place off Enok’s shore and beach, and spear
such flounder as had been nearest Enok’s
hand. And if he chanced to need a thole-pin
or a bit of wood for a baling scoop, it
was always in Enok’s fir-copse close to
the water that he sought it. He kept a
constant eye on Enok himself.</p>

<p>It was soon noised abroad that Jomfru van
Loos had broken off her engagement, and in
the depth of that disgrace was leaving the
Vicarage at once. Trader Mack felt that
Rolandsen, poor fellow, was having trouble
enough over the affair, and endeavoured now
himself to heal the breach. He took down
Rolandsen’s announcement with his own
hands from the gatepost, and declared that
it was by no wish of his it had been set
there at all. Then he went down to the
Vicarage. Mack could afford to be tolerant
now; he had already marked what a profound
impression his generous behaviour in
the burglary affair had produced. People
greeted him now as respectfully as ever,&mdash;even,
it seemed, with greater esteem than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
before. Surely there was but one Mack on
all the coast!</p>

<p>But his visit to the Vicarage proved of no
avail. Jomfru van Loos was moved even
to tears at the thought of Mack’s coming
in person, but no one on earth should
persuade her now to make it up with
Rolandsen, never! Mack gathered that it
was the priest who had brought her to such
a pitch of determination.</p>

<p>When Jomfru van Loos went down to the
boat, her master and mistress saw her off.
Both wished her a pleasant journey, and
watched her get into the boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven,” said Jomfru van Loos,
“I know he’s up there in the woods this
minute and bitterly repenting.” And she
took out her handkerchief.</p>

<p>The boat pushed off and glided away
under long strokes.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Jomfru van Loos,
half rising. She looked for a moment as if
about to wade ashore. Then she fell to
waving with all her might up towards the
woods. And the boat disappeared round
the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Rolandsen went home through the woods
as he had taken to doing of late; but coming
opposite the Vicarage fence, he moved down
on to the road and followed it. Well, now
all his samples were sent off, he had nothing
to do but await the result. It would not
take long. And Rolandsen snapped his
fingers from sheer lightness of heart as he
walked.</p>

<p>A little farther on sat Olga, the parish
clerk’s daughter, on a stone by the roadside.
What was she doing there? Rolandsen
thought to himself: She must be coming
from the store, and waiting for somebody
here. A little later came Elise Mack. Oho!
were they inseparables now? She too sat
down, and seemed to be waiting. Now was
the time to delight the ladies by appearing
crushed and humbled, a very worm,
thought Rolandsen to himself. He turned
off hurriedly into the wood. But the dried
twigs crackled underfoot; they could hear him.
It would be a fruitless attempt, and he gave
it up. Might go down the road again, he
thought; no need to delight them overmuch.
And he walked down along the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not so easy after all to face
Elise Mack. His heart began to beat
heavily, a sudden warmth flowed through
him, and he stopped. He had gained
nothing that last time, and since then a
great misdeed had been added against him.
He drew off backward into the wood again.
If only he were past this clearing, the dry
twigs would come to an end and the heather
begin. He took it in a few long strides,
and was saved. Suddenly he stopped;
what the devil was he hopping about like
this for? He, Ove Rolandsen! He turned,
and strode defiantly back across the clearing,
tramping over dry twigs as loudly as he
pleased.</p>

<p>Coming down on to the road again, he
saw the ladies still seated in the same place.
They were talking, and Elise was digging
at the ground with the point of her parasol.
Rolandsen halted again. Your dare-devil
sort are ever the most cautious. “But I’m
a thief,” he said to himself. “How can I
have the face to show myself? If I give a
greeting, it will be forcing them to recognise
me.” And once more he drew back among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the trees. What a fool he was, to go about
with such feelings&mdash;as if he had not other
things to think about! A couple of months
hence he would be rich, a man of wealth
and position. In love? The devil take all
such fancies. And he turned his steps
towards home.</p>

<p>Were they sitting there still, he wondered.
He turned and stole a glance. Frederik
had joined them, and here they were all
three coming towards him. He hurried
back, with his heart in his mouth. If only
they had not seen him! They stopped, and
he heard Frederik Mack say, “Sh! There’s
someone in the wood.”&mdash;“Oh, it’s nothing,”
answered Elise.</p>

<p>Like as not she said so because she had
seen him, thought Rolandsen. And the
thought made him cold and bitter all at once.
No, of course, he was nothing&mdash;nothing as
yet. But wait, only two months.... And
anyhow, what was she herself? A Virgin
Mary cold as iron, daughter of the Lutheran
celebrity Mack of Rosengaard. <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Bliv i Freden!</i></p>

<p>There was a weathercock on the roof of
the telegraph station, perched on an iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
rod. Rolandsen came home, climbed up to
the roof, and bent that iron rod with his own
hands, till the cock leaned backward, as if
in the act of crowing. Let it stand so; it
was only right the cock should crow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>


<p>And now sets in a time of easy days for
all, no fishing beyond the little for
home needs; fishing on warm, sunny nights&mdash;a
pleasant task, a pastime. Corn and
potatoes growing, and meadows waving;
herring stored in every shed, and cows and
goats milking full pails, and rolling in fat
themselves.</p>

<p>Mack and his daughter Elise have gone
back home again; Frederik reigns alone
over the factory and the store. And
Frederik’s rule is none of the best; he is
full of his own thoughts of the sea, and hates
this life on shore. Captain Henriksen of
the coasting steamer has half promised to
get him a berth as mate on board his vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
but it never seems to come to anything.
Then comes the question whether old Mack
will buy a steamer himself for his son to run.
He talks of it, and seems willing enough,
but Frederik guesses it is more than he can
do. Frederik knows the position pretty
well. He is strangely little of a seaman by
nature, a cautious and reliable youth, doing
just as much of this thing and that as is
needed in his daily life. He takes after his
mother, and is not altogether the true Mack
type. But that is well for one who would get
on in the world and succeed; never do too
much, but rather a little too little of everything,
so it could be reckoned as just enough. Look
at Rolandsen, for instance, that extravagant
madcap with his wild fancies. A common
thief among his fellows, that was what he
had come to, and lost his position into the
bargain. And there he was, going about
with a burdened conscience, wearing his
clothes down thinner and thinner, and never
so much as a room of his own to live in,
saving a bit of a bedroom at Børre the
organ-blower’s, and that was humble enough.
That was the end of Ove Rolandsen. Børre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
might be an excellent man in his way, but
he was the poorest in the place, and had
least herring in his store. And seeing his
daughter Pernille was a poor, weakly creature,
the organ-blower’s house was never reckoned
for much. It was not the place a man of
any decent position could choose to live in.</p>

<p>It was said that Rolandsen might have
avoided dismissal if only he had behaved
with proper contrition towards the visiting
Inspector. But Rolandsen had simply taken
it for granted that he was to be dismissed,
and had given the Inspector no opportunity
of pardoning him. And old Mack, the
mediator, was not there.</p>

<p>But the priest was not altogether displeased
with Rolandsen. “I’ve heard he
drinks less than he used to,” he said. “And
I should not regard him as altogether
lost. He himself admits that it was
a letter from me that led him to confess
about the burglary. It is encouraging to
see one’s work bear fruit now and again.”</p>

<p>Midsummer’s eve came round, and fires
were lit on high places, young men and
girls from the fisher-huts gathered about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fires, fiddles and concertinas were heard
about the village. The best way was to
make only the least little fire, but heaps of
smoke; damp moss and juniper twigs were
flung on the fires to make the smoke
properly thick and scented.</p>

<p>Rolandsen was still unabashed enough to
take part in the popular festivity; he sat
on a big rock thrumming at his guitar, and
singing till the valley echoed again. When
he came down and joined those about the
fire, he was seen to be as drunk as an owl,
and overflowing with magnificent speech.
The same as ever; an incorrigible.</p>

<p>But then came Olga walking down the
road. She had never a thought of stopping
here; she was but walking that way and
would have passed by. Oh, she might well
have gone another way; but Olga was young,
and the music of the concertina drew her; her
nostrils quivered, a fountain of happiness was
in her&mdash;she was in love. She had been to the
store earlier in the day, and Frederik Mack had
said words enough for her to understand, for
all he spoke with caution. And now, perhaps
he too might be out for a walk this evening!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Fruen came down from the Vicarage; the
two walked on together, talking of no other
than Frederik Mack. He was the lord of
the village, and even Fruen’s heart had
bowed to him in secret; he was so nice and
careful, and kept to earth at every step.
Fruen noticed at last that Olga was overcome
with shyness about something, and
asked, “But, child, what makes you so
quiet? Surely you haven’t fallen in love
with this young Mack?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” whispered Olga, bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>Fruen stopped, “Olga, Olga! And
does he care for you?”</p>

<p>“I think he does.”</p>

<p>And at that Fruen’s eyes grew quiet and
stupid-looking again, and gazed emptily into
air. “Well, well,” she said, with a smile.
“Heaven bless you, child; it will come all
right, you see.” And she was kinder than
ever to Olga after that.</p>

<p>When they reached the Vicarage, the
priest was walking up and down in great
excitement. “The woods are on fire,” he
cried. “I could see it from the window.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
And he got a supply of axes and picks and
men, and manned his boat down at the
waterside. It was Enok’s copse that was
burning.</p>

<p>But ahead of the priest and his party
went ex-Lay-helper Levion. Levion had
been out seeing to his lines; he had set
them as usual just off Enok’s ground, and
caught a decent batch. Then on the way
back he saw a tiny flame break out in the
wood, and grow bigger and bigger. Levion
nodded a little to himself, as if he understood
what a little flame like that might
mean. And then, seeing folk moving busily
about round the priest’s boathouse, he understands
they have come down to help; he
heads his boat round and puts in at once, to
be first on the spot. It was beautiful to see
him laying aside all enmity at once and
hurrying to his rival’s aid.</p>

<p>Levion puts in to shore and moves up at
once to the wood; he can hear the roar of
the fire already. He takes his time, looking
round carefully at every step; presently he
spies Enok coming along in the greatest
haste. Levion is seized with great excitement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he slips behind an overhanging rock
and peers out from cover. Enok comes
nearer, moving with a purpose, looking
neither right nor left, but coming straight
on. Had he discovered his enemy, and was
coming to seek him? When he was quite
close up, Levion gave a hail. Enok started,
and came to a halt. And in his confusion
he smiled, and said:</p>

<p>“Here’s a fire, worse luck. There’s
trouble abroad.”</p>

<p>The other took courage, and answered,
“’Twill be the finger of God, no doubt.”</p>

<p>Enok frowned. “What are you standing
about here for?” he asked.</p>

<p>All Levion’s hatred flares up now, and he
says, “Ho-ho! ’Twill be over-hot for kerchiefs
round the ears now.”</p>

<p>“Get away with you!” says Enok. “Like
as not it was you that started the fire.”</p>

<p>But Levion was blind and deaf. Enok
seemed to be making towards just that
corner of the rock where Levion stood.</p>

<p>“Keep off!” cries Levion. “I’ve torn
off one of your ears already&mdash;do you want
me to take the other?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get away with you, d’you hear?” says
Enok, coming closer.</p>

<p>Levion was choking and swallowing with
anger. He cried out loud, “Remember
that day in the fjord, when I caught you
pulling up my lines? I twisted one ear off
then....”</p>

<p>And that was why Enok went about with
a kerchief round his head; he had but one
ear. And both he and Levion had very good
reasons for keeping quiet about the matter.</p>

<p>“You’re no better than a murderer, to
speak of,” said Enok.</p>

<p>The priest’s boat was heard rushing in to
land, and from the other side came the roar
of the fire, ever nearer. Enok writhed, and
tried again to make Levion retreat; he drew
his knife&mdash;that excellent knife for cutting
things.</p>

<p>Levion rolled his eyes and screamed out,
“As sure as you dare come waving knives
at me, there’s folk at hand already, and here
they come!”</p>

<p>Enok put up his knife again. “What
d’you want standing there anyway?” he
said. “Get away with you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you doing here yourself,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“What’s that to you? I’ve an errand
here; some things I’ve hidden here. And
there’s the fire all close up.”</p>

<p>But Levion stayed defiantly, and would
not move an inch. Here was the priest
coming up, and he, no doubt, could hear
the two in dispute&mdash;but what did Levion
care for him now?</p>

<p>The boat lay to, and those on board
rushed up with axe and pick. The priest
gave a brief greeting and a hasty word.
“These midsummer bonfires are dangerous,
Enok; the sparks fly about all over the
place. Where had we better begin?”</p>

<p>Enok was at a loss for the moment; the
priest had put him out, and drew him away
now, so that he could not deal with Levion
further.</p>

<p>“Which way’s the wind?” asked the priest.
“Come and show us where to start digging.”</p>

<p>But Enok was desperately ill at ease; he
looked round anxiously for Levion, and
answered at random.</p>

<p>“Do not give way so,” said the priest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“Pull yourself together, and be a man. We
must get the fire under.” And he took
Enok by the arm.</p>

<p>Some of the men had already moved
forward towards the fire, and were digging
across its path. Levion was still in his old
place, breathing hard; he kicked at a flat
stone that lay in under the rock. “He
won’t have hidden anything here,” thought
Levion to himself. “It was just a lie.”
But he looked down again, and, kicking
away some of the earth, he came upon a
kerchief. One of Enok’s kerchiefs it was&mdash;a
quondam bandage for the earache. Levion
picked it up; there was something wrapped
in it. He unfastened it, and there was
money&mdash;paper money&mdash;notes, and many of
them. Furthermore, there was a document,
a big white sheet. Levion was full of curiosity.
He thought at once, “Stolen money!”
And he unfolded the document and began to
spell it through.</p>

<p>Then it was that Enok caught sight of
him, and gave a hoarse cry; breaking away
from the priest, he rushed back towards
Levion, knife in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Enok, Enok!” cried the priest, making
after him.</p>

<p>“Here is the thief!” cried Levion, as
they came up.</p>

<p>The priest fancied Enok must have gone
suddenly demented at sight of the fire.
“Put up your knife!” he called out.</p>

<p>Levion went on, “Here’s the burglar that
stole Mack’s money.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” asked the priest
uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>Enok makes a dash at his opponent, and
tries to snatch the packet away.</p>

<p>“Get out! I’m going to hand it over to
the priest,” cries Levion. “And he can
see for himself the sort of helper he’s got
now.”</p>

<p>Enok staggered to a tree; his face was
grey. The priest looks blankly at the
paper, the kerchief, and the notes; he can
make nothing of it all.</p>

<p>“I found it there,” says Levion, shaking
all over. “He’d hidden it under a stone.
There’s Mack’s name on the paper, you
can see.”</p>

<p>The priest examined it, growing more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
more astounded as he read. “This must be
the insurance policy Mack said he had lost,
surely?”</p>

<p>“And the money he lost as well,” said
Levion.</p>

<p>Enok pulled himself together. “Then
you must have put it there,” he said.</p>

<p>The roar of the forest fire came nearer,
the air was growing hotter and hotter about
them, but the three men stood still.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it,” said Enok
again. “It’s just a trick of Levion’s, to do
me harm.”</p>

<p>Said Levion, “Here’s two hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>.
Have I ever had two hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> in my
life? And isn’t this your kerchief? Isn’t it
one you’ve worn over your ears?”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t that so?” seconded the priest.</p>

<p>Enok was silent.</p>

<p>The priest was counting over the notes.
“There are not two hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> here,”
he said.</p>

<p>“He’s spent some of it, of course,” said
Levion.</p>

<p>But Enok stood breathing heavily. “I
know nothing about it,” he said. “But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for you, Levion, you see if I don’t remember
you for this!”</p>

<p>The priest was utterly at a loss. If Enok
were the thief, then Rolandsen had only
been making a jest of the letter he had sent
him. And what for?</p>

<p>The heat was growing unbearable; the
three men moved down towards the water,
the fire at their heels. They were forced to
get into the boat, and then to push off away
from land altogether.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, this is Mack’s policy,” said
the priest. “We must report what has
happened. Row back home, Levion.”</p>

<p>Enok was annihilated, and sat staring
gloomily before him. “Ay, let’s go and
report it,” he said. “That’s all I want.”</p>

<p>The priest gave him a troubled look.
“Do you, I wonder?” he said. And he
closed his eyes in horror at the whole affair.</p>

<p>Enok, in his covetousness, had been too
simple. He had carefully preserved the
insurance paper that he could make nothing
of. It was an imposing-looking document,
with stamps on, and a great sum of money
written there; who could say but he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
be able to go away some day and sell it? It
was surely too valuable to throw away.</p>

<p>The priest turned and looked back at the
fire. Men were at work in the woods, trees
were falling, and a broad trench was spreading
darkly across. More helpers had come
up to join in the work.</p>

<p>“The fire’ll stop of itself,” said Levion.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Soon as it gets to the birches it’ll stop.”</p>

<p>And the boat with the three men on board
rowed in to the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand’s</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>


<p>When the priest came back that evening
he had been weeping. Evil
and wrong-doing seemed to flourish all about
him. He was wounded and humbled with
sorrow; now his wife could not even have
the shoes she needed so badly. Enok’s rich
offering would have to be returned to the
giver, as being stolen goods. And that
would leave the priest blank and bare.</p>

<p>He went up to his wife at once. But
even before he had passed the door of her
room, new trouble and despair came to meet
him. His wife was sewing. Garments were
strewn about the floor, a fork and a dishcloth
from the kitchen lay on the bed,
together with newspapers and some crochet-work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
One of her slippers was on the table.
On her chest of drawers lay a branch of
birch in leaf and a big grey pebblestone.</p>

<p>He set about, from force of habit, putting
things in order.</p>

<p>“You’ve no need to trouble,” said she.
“I was going to put that slipper away
myself as soon as I’d done my sewing.”</p>

<p>“But how can you sit and work with the
place in such a mess?”</p>

<p>At this she was offended, and made no
answer.</p>

<p>“What do you want that stone for?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“It’s not for anything particular. I just
found it on the beach, and it was so pretty.”</p>

<p>He swept up a little heap of faded grass
that lay beside the mirror, and put it in a
newspaper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if you want this for anything?”
he asked, checking himself.</p>

<p>“No, it’s no good now. It’s sorrel; I was
going to use it for a salad.”</p>

<p>“It’s been lying here over a week,” he
said. “And it’s made a stain here on the
polish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, that shows you. Polished
furniture’s such a nuisance; I can’t see any
sense in it myself.”</p>

<p>At that he burst out into an angry
laugh. His wife dropped her work and
stood up.</p>

<p>He could never leave her in peace, but
was always worrying the life out of her with
his lack of sense. And so they drifted once
more into one of the foolish, fruitless quarrels
that had been repeated at intervals through
the past four years. The priest had come
up in all humility to beg his wife’s indulgence
because he could not get her the new shoes
at once, but he found it now more and more
impossible to carry out his purpose; bitterness
overpowered him. Things were all
wrong every way at the Vicarage since
Jomfru van Loos had left them and his wife
had taken over the housekeeping herself.</p>

<p>“And while I think of it, I wish you
would use a little sense and thought over
things in the kitchen,” he said.</p>

<p>“Sense and thought? And don’t I, then?
Do you mean to say things are worse now
than before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I found the dust-bin full of good food
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“If only you wouldn’t go interfering with
everything....”</p>

<p>“I found a dish of cream from the dinner
the other day.”</p>

<p>“Well, the maids had been at it, and I
didn’t care to use it after them.”</p>

<p>“I found a lot of rice as well.”</p>

<p>“It was the milk had turned, and spoiled
it. I couldn’t help that, could I?”</p>

<p>“One day I found a boiled egg, with the
shell off, in the dust-bin.”</p>

<p>His wife was silent. Though, indeed, she
could have found something to say to that
as well.</p>

<p>“We’re not exactly rich enough to waste
things,” said the priest. “And you know
yourself we have to pay for the eggs. One
day the cat was eating an omelette.”</p>

<p>“Only a bit that was left from dinner.
But you’re all unreasonable, and that’s the
truth; you ought to see a doctor for that
temper of yours.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you stand holding the cat and
pushing a bowl of milk under its nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
And you let the maids see it too. They
laugh at you behind your back.”</p>

<p>“They <em>don’t</em>. It’s only you that are
always nasty and ill-tempered.”</p>

<p>The end of it was that the priest went
back to his study, and his wife was left in
peace.</p>

<p>At breakfast next morning no one could
see from her looks that she had been suffering
and wretched. All her trouble seemed
charmed away, and not a memory of their
quarrel left. Her easy, changeable nature
stood her in good stead, and helped to make
her life endurable. The priest was touched
once more. After all, he might as well
have held his peace about these household
matters; the new housekeeper would be
coming soon, and should be on her way
already.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you’ll hardly be able to get
those shoes just yet,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, no,” was all she said.</p>

<p>“Enok’s offering will have to be returned;
the money was stolen.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, only fancy&mdash;it was he who stole all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that money from Mack. He confessed
before the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand</i> yesterday.” And the
priest told her the whole story.</p>

<p>“Then it wasn’t Rolandsen after all...”
said Fruen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rolandsen&mdash;he’s always in mischief
some way or other. An incorrigible fellow.
But, anyhow, I’m afraid your shoes will have
to wait again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it doesn’t matter about the
shoes.”</p>

<p>That was her way, always kind and unselfish
to the last&mdash;a mere child. And her
husband had never heard her complain about
their poverty.</p>

<p>“If only you could wear mine,” he said,
softening.</p>

<p>But at that she laughed heartily. “Yes,
and you wear mine instead, ha-ha-ha!” And
here she dropped his plate on the floor and
smashed it; dropped the cold cutlet as well.
“Wait a minute; I’ll fetch another plate,”
she said, and hurried out.</p>

<p>Never a word about the damage, thought
the priest; never so much as entered her
head. And plates cost money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you’re surely not going to eat that
cutlet?” said his wife when she came in.</p>

<p>“Why, what else should we do with it?”</p>

<p>“Give it to the cat, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t afford that sort of
thing, if you can,” said he, turning gloomy
again. And this might have led to a first-rate
quarrel again, if she had not been wise
enough to pass it over in silence. As it
was, both felt suddenly out of spirits....</p>

<p>Next day another remarkable happening
was noised abroad: Rolandsen had disappeared.
On hearing the news of the find
in the wood, and Enok’s confession, he had
exclaimed, “The devil! It’s come too
early&mdash;by a month, at least.” Børre the
organ-blower had heard it. Then, later in
the evening, Rolandsen was nowhere to be
found, within doors or without. But Børre’s
little boat, that was drawn up at the Vicarage
landing-place, had disappeared, together
with oars and fishing-gear and all that was
in it.</p>

<p>Word was sent to Rosengaard at once
about the discovery of the true thief, but,
strangely enough, Mack seemed in no hurry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to come back and take the matter up anew.
Doubtless he had his reasons. Rolandsen
had cheated him into paying out a reward,
and he would now have to pay the same
sum over again, which was by no means
convenient at the moment. A true Mack,
he would never think of acting less open-handedly
now than before,&mdash;it was a point
of honour with him,&mdash;but just at the moment
he was pressed for money. Mack’s numerous
and various undertakings called for considerable
disbursements, and there had been
no great influx of ready cash for some time
past. There was his big consignment of
herring still in the hands of the agents at
Bergen; prices were low, and Mack was
holding. He waited impatiently for the
dog-days; after that, the fishing would be
definitely at an end, and prices would go up.
Also, the Russians were at war, and agriculture
in that widespread land would be
neglected; the population would need fish
to help them out.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and Mack failed to appear
at the factory at all. There was that bakery,
too, that he had promised the people at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Vicarage&mdash;and what was he to say when
Fruen asked him? The foundations were
laid, and the ground had been levelled, but
no building was being done. Once more
folk began to whisper about Mack; how,
like as not, he would find it awkward to get
on with that bakery place. So strong was
this feeling of doubt, that the baker at the
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Lensmand’s</i> took to drink again. He felt
himself secure; a bakery could not be run
up in a week; there was time at any rate for
a good solid bout. The priest heard of his
backsliding, and appealed to him in person,
but with little effect; the man felt safe at
least for the time being.</p>

<p>And in truth, the priest, who was ever a
worker, had much on his hands just now;
he spared no effort, but for all that he seemed
always behindhand. And now he had lost
one of his helpers, the most zealous of them
all&mdash;Enok to wit. Only a couple of days
after that disaster, Levion had come up
once more, and showed himself extremely
willing to be reinstated.</p>

<p>“Priest can see now, surely, there’s none
could be better for the place than me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“H’m! You are suspected of having
started that fire yourself.”</p>

<p>“’Tis an everlasting thief and scoundrel
said that lie!” exclaimed Levion.</p>

<p>“Good! But anyhow, you’re not going
to be helper again.”</p>

<p>“Who’s it to be this time, then?”</p>

<p>“No one. I shall manage without.”</p>

<p>That sort of man was the priest; strong
and stiff and just in his dealings with all.
And he had reason now to mortify himself
without pity. The constant discomfort at
home and the many difficulties of his office
were striving to demoralise him and tempt
him to his fall; reprehensible thoughts came
into his head at times. Why, for instance,
should he not make peace with Levion,
who could be useful to him in many little
matters by way of return? Furthermore,
Mack of Rosengaard had offered his help
in any deserving case of actual need. Well
and good! He, the priest himself, was in
greater need than any of his flock. Why not
apply to Mack for help on behalf of a family
in distress, and keep the help so given for
himself? Then he could get that pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
shoes for his wife. He himself needed one
or two little things as well&mdash;a few books,
a little philosophy; he felt himself withering
up in the round of daily toil; his development
was checked. Rolandsen, that glib-tongued
rogue, had declared it was human beings
had made God what He was, and the priest
had marked the effect of that upon his own
wife. He needed books from which to arm
himself for the abolishment of Rolandsen
as soon as opportunity arose.</p>

<p>Mack came at last&mdash;came, as usual, in
splendour and state; his daughter Elise
was with him. He called at the Vicarage
at once, as a matter of courtesy; moreover,
he did not in any way desire to hide away
from his promise. Fruen asked about the
bakery. Mack regretted that he had been
unable to get the work done sooner, but
there were very good reasons. It was a
flat impossibility to get the building done
this year; the foundations must have time
to settle first. Fruen gave a little cry of
disappointment, but her husband was relieved.</p>

<p>“That’s what the experts tell me,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Mack. “And what can I do? If we were
to build and finish now, then next spring’s
thaw might shift the whole foundation
several inches. And what would happen
to the building above?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” agreed the priest.</p>

<p>But it must not be thought that Mack
was in any way discouraged; far from it.
The dog-days were past, the herring fishery
was at an end, and the agent in Bergen had
wired that prices were going up by leaps
and bounds. Mack could not help telling
them the news at the Vicarage. And in
return the priest was able to inform him
where Rolandsen was hiding, on an island
among the outer reefs, far to the west, like
a wild savage. A man and woman had
come up to the Vicarage and brought the
news.</p>

<p>Mack sent off a boat at once in search.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>


<p>The fact of the matter was, that Enok’s
confession had taken Rolandsen all
unawares. He was free now, but, on the
other hand, he had not the four hundred
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i> to pay Mack. And so it came about
that he took the boat, with Børre’s gear and
tackle, and rowed away in the silent night.
He made for the outer islands, and that was
a six-mile journey, part of it over open sea.
He rowed all night, and looked about in the
morning till he found a suitable island. Here
he landed; wild birds of all sorts flew up
about him.</p>

<p>Rolandsen was hungry; his first thought
was to gather a score of gull’s eggs and make
a meal. But he found the eggs all addled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Then he rowed out fishing, and had more
luck. And now he lived on fish from day
to day, and sang and wore the time away,
and was lord of that island. When it rained,
he had a first-rate shelter under an overhanging
rock. He slept on a grassy patch
at night, and the sun never set.</p>

<p>Two weeks, three weeks, passed. Rolandsen
grew desperately thin from his wretched
mode of life, but his eyes grew harder and
harder from sheer determination, and he
would not give in. His only fear was that
someone might come and disturb him. A
few nights back there had come a boat, a
man and a woman in it&mdash;a pair out gathering
down. They would have landed on the
island, but Rolandsen was by no means that
way inclined. He had sighted them afar off,
and had time to work himself up into a fury,
so that when they arrived, he made such
threatening play with Børre’s tiny anchor
that the couple rowed away in fright. Then
Rolandsen laughed to himself, and a most
uncomely fiend he was to look at, with his
hollow cheeks.</p>

<p>One morning the birds made more noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
than usual, and Rolandsen awoke, though it
was still so early as to be almost night. He
sees a boat making in, already close at hand.
It was always a trouble with Rolandsen that
he was so slow to anger. Here was this
boat coming in, and its coming highly
inconvenient to him just then, but by the
time he had worked up an adequate rage,
the men had landed. If only they had given
him time, he might have done something to
stop them; might have pelted them to rags
with stones from the beach.</p>

<p>They were two of Mack’s folk from the
factory, father and son. They stepped
ashore, and “<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Goddag!</i>” said the older one.</p>

<p>“I’m not the least little pleased to see
you, and I’ll do you a hurt,” said Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“Ho, and how’ll you do that?” said the
man, with a look at his son, but not very
bold for all that.</p>

<p>“Throttle you dead, for instance. What
do you say to that little plan?”</p>

<p>“’Twas Mack himself that sent us to find
you here.”</p>

<p>“Of course it was Mack himself. I know
well enough what he wants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the younger man put in a word,
and this was that Børre the organ-blower
wanted his boat and gear.</p>

<p>Rolandsen shouted bitterly at that.
“Børre! Is the fellow mad? And what
about me then? Here am I living on a
desert island; I must have a boat to get to
folk, and gear to fish with, if I’m not to
starve. Tell him that from me!”</p>

<p>“And then there was a word from the
new man at the station, how there’s telegrams
waiting for you there. Important.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen jumped. Already! He asked
a question or so, which they answered, and
thereafter he made no further objection, but
went back with them. The younger man
rowed Børre’s boat, and Rolandsen sat in
the other.</p>

<p>There was a provision-box in the forepart
of the boat, that waked in his mind impertinent
hopes of food. He was on the point
of asking if they had brought anything to
eat with them, but restrained himself, out of
sheer lordliness and pride, and tried to talk
it off.</p>

<p>“How did Mack know I was here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Twas the news came. A man and a
woman saw you here one night; you
frightened them a deal.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did they want here anyway?
And I’ve hit on a new fishing-ground
there by the island. And now I’m leaving
it.”</p>

<p>“How long’d you thought to be staying
there?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no business of yours,” said Rolandsen
sharply. His eyes were fixed on that provision-box,
but he showed himself as ready
to burst, out of sheer pride, and said, “It’s
more than commonly ugly, that box there.
Shouldn’t think anyone’d care to keep food
in a thing like that. What d’you use
it for?”</p>

<p>“If only I’d all the butter and cheese and
pork and butcher’s meat’s been in that box,
I’d not go hungry for years to come,”
answered the man.</p>

<p>Rolandsen cleared his throat, and spat
over the side.</p>

<p>“When did those telegrams come?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Eh, that’ll be some time back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-way across, the two boats closed in
and lay alongside; father and son brought
out their meal from the box, and Rolandsen
looked all other ways. Said the old man,
“We’ve a bite of food here, if as you’re not
too proud.” And they passed the whole
box across.</p>

<p>But Rolandsen waved it away, and
answered:</p>

<p>“I’m fed, no more than half an hour
since. As much as I could eat. That
cake of bread there looks uncommonly
nicely done, though. No, no, thanks; I
was only looking at it ... smells nice,
too....”</p>

<p>And Rolandsen chattered away, looking
to every other side.</p>

<p>“We’re never short of plenty these parts,
and that’s the truth,” he went on. “I’ll wager
now there’s not a hut nor shed but’s got its
leg of meat hung up. But there’s no need
to be always eating so much; ’tis a beastly
fashion.”</p>

<p>He writhed uncomfortably on his seat,
and went on:</p>

<p>“How long I was going to stay there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
d’you say? Why, I’d have stayed till the
autumn, to see the shooting stars. I’ve a
great fancy for such things; it tickles me
to see whole planets go to pieces.”</p>

<p>“There you’re talking more than I
know of.”</p>

<p>“Planets, man&mdash;stars. Butting into one
another all across the sky. ’Tis a wild and
wicked sight.”</p>

<p>But the men went on eating, and at last
Rolandsen could contain himself no longer.
“What pigs you are to eat, you two!
Stuffing all that into you at once&mdash;I never
saw....”</p>

<p>“We’ve done,” said the old man quietly
enough.</p>

<p>The boats pushed apart, and the two men
bent to their oars. Rolandsen lay back and
tried to sleep.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when they got in, and
Rolandsen went up to the station at once
for his telegrams. There were encouraging
messages about his invention; a high bid for
the patent rights from Hamburg, and a still
higher one from another firm through the
bureau. And Rolandsen, in his incompre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>hensible
fashion, must needs run off to the
woods and stay there alone for quite a while
before he thought of getting a bite to eat.
The excess of feeling made him a boy again;
he was as a child, with folded hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>


<p>He went to Mack’s office, and went
thither as a man come to his own, ay,
as a lion. There would be strange feelings
in the Mack family at seeing him again.
Elise, maybe, would congratulate him, and
kindliness from her would be a joy.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed. He came upon
Elise outside the factory, talking to her
brother; she paid so little heed to him that
his greeting all but passed unanswered. And
the pair went on talking as before. Rolandsen
would not disturb them by asking for
old Mack, but went up to the office and
knocked at the door. It was locked. He
went down again and said, “Your father
sent for me; where shall I find him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The two were in no hurry to answer, but
finished what they had to say. Then said
Frederik, “Father’s up at the watergate.”</p>

<p>“Might have said that when I came up
first,” thought Rolandsen. Oh, they were
all indifferent to him now; they had let him
go up to the office without a word.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you send word to him?” asked
Rolandsen.</p>

<p>Said Frederik slowly, “When father’s up
at the watergate, he’s there because he’s
business there.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen looked at the two with eyes
of wonder.</p>

<p>“Better come again later on,” said
Frederik.</p>

<p>“If I come a second time, it’ll be to say I
shan’t come a third.”</p>

<p>Frederik shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“There’s father,” said Elise.</p>

<p>Old Mack came walking towards them.
He frowned, spoke sharply, and walked on
ahead of Rolandsen to the office. All ungraciousness.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Last time, I asked you to sit down.
This time, I don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said Rolandsen. But he was
puzzled at the other’s angry manner.</p>

<p>But Mack found no pleasure in being
harsh. He had power over this man, who
had done him a wrong, and he preferred to
show himself too proud to use it. He said,
“You know, of course, what has happened
here?”</p>

<p>Said Rolandsen, “I have been away.
Things may have happened that you know
of, but not I.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it is, then,” said Mack.
And Mack was now as a minor God, with
the fate of a human creature in his hand.
“You burnt up that insurance policy, I think
you said?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” said Rolandsen.
“To tell the truth....”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Mack, and brought out
the document. “The money has been
found, too. The whole lot was found
wrapped up in a kerchief that did <em>not</em>
belong to you.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen made no protest.</p>

<p>“It belonged to Enok,” Mack went on.</p>

<p>Rolandsen could not help smiling at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
other’s solemn manner, and said jestingly,
“Ah, now I shouldn’t be surprised if it was
Enok was the thief.”</p>

<p>Mack found this tone by no means to his
taste; it was lacking in respect. “You’ve
made a fool of me,” he said, “and cheated
me out of four hundred <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Daler</i>.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen, with his precious telegrams in
his pocket, still found it hard to be serious.
“Let’s talk it over a little,” said he.</p>

<p>Then said Mack sharply, “Last time,
I forgave you. This time, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“I can pay you back the money.”</p>

<p>Mack turned on him angrily. “The
money’s no more to me now than it was
then. But you’re a cheat; do you realise
that?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll allow me, I’ll explain.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s all unreasonable,” said
Rolandsen, still smiling. “What do you
want with me at all, then?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have you locked up,” said
Mack.</p>

<p>Frederik came in, and went to his place at
the desk. He had heard the last words, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
saw his father now, for once, in a state of
excitement.</p>

<p>Rolandsen thrust his hand into his pocket,
where the telegrams lay, and said, “Won’t
you accept the money, then?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mack. “You can hand it
over to the authorities.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen stood there still. Nothing of
a lion now; properly speaking, he had made
a big mistake, and might be put in prison.
Well and good! And when Mack looked
at him inquiringly, as if to ask what he
might be standing there for, he answered,
“I’m waiting to be locked up.”</p>

<p>“Here?” Mack looked at him in
astonishment. “No, you can go along home
and get ready.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’ve some telegrams to send
off.”</p>

<p>Mack turned gentler all at once. After
all, he was not a savage. “I’ll give you
to-day and to-morrow to get ready,” he said.</p>

<p>Rolandsen bowed, and went out.</p>

<p>Elise was still standing outside; he passed
by her this time without a sign. What was
lost was lost; there was no helping it now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But Elise called to him softly, and he
stopped, stood gazing at her, shaken and
confused in his surprise.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I was only going to say ... it’s
nothing serious, is it?”</p>

<p>Rolandsen could make nothing of this;
could not understand why she had suddenly
chosen to speak to him at all. “I’ve got
leave to go home,” he said. “To send off
some telegrams.”</p>

<p>She came up close to him, her breast
heaving; she looked round, as if in fear of
something. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Father was angry, I suppose. But it’ll
soon pass off, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen was offended; had he himself
no right in the case? “Your father can do
as he pleases,” he said.</p>

<p>Ho, so that was his tone! But Elise
breathed heavily as before, and said, “Why
do you look at me like that? Don’t you
know me again?”</p>

<p>Grace and kindliness without end.
Rolandsen answered, “As to knowing
again or not, that’s as folk themselves will
have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Pause. Then said Elise at last, “But
surely you can see, after what you’ve done
... still, it’s worst for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Good! Let it be worst for myself then.
I’m not going to be called to account by all
and sundry&mdash;I won’t stand it. Your father
can have me locked up if he likes.”</p>

<p>She turned without a word and left
him....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rolandsen waited for two days&mdash;waited
for three, but there came none to the organ-blower’s
house to arrest him. He was in
dire excitement. He had written out his
telegrams, ready to send off the moment he
was arrested; he would accept the highest
bid for his invention, and sell the patent.
Meantime, he was not idle; he kept the
foreign firms busy with negotiations about
this and that, such as purchase of the falls
above Mack’s factory, and guarantees of
transport facilities. All these matters were
left in his hands for the present.</p>

<p>But Mack was not inclined to persecute a
fellow-creature just now; on the contrary,
his business was going excellently, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
long as things went well, it pleased him far
more to be generous beyond need. A new
telegram from the agent in Bergen had
informed him that the fish was sold to
Russia; if Mack had need of money, money
was at his disposal. Altogether, Mack was
getting on swimmingly again.</p>

<p>When over a week had passed without
any change, Rolandsen went down to Mack’s
office again. He was worn out with anxiety
and uncertainty; he felt he must have a
decision.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting a week, and you
haven’t had me arrested yet,” he said.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said Mack indulgently, “I
have been thinking over your affair....”</p>

<p>“Old man,” said Rolandsen violently,
“you’ll please to settle it now! You think
you can go on for ever and ever and be
mightily gracious as long as you please, but
I’ll soon put a stop to that. I’ll give myself
up to the police.”</p>

<p>“Really, this tone,” said Mack, “it’s not
what I should have expected from you,
considering....”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you what you can expect from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
me,” cried Rolandsen, with unnecessary
arrogance. And he flung down his telegrams
on the desk. Rolandsen’s big nose looked
even more aggressive than usual, since he
had got thinner in the face.</p>

<p>Mack glanced through the messages.
“So you’ve turned inventor?” he said carelessly.
But as he read on, he screwed up
his eyes intently. “Fish-glue,” said he at
last. And then he went through the telegrams
once more.</p>

<p>“This looks very promising,” he said,
looking up. “Am I to understand you’ve
been offered all this money for a fish-glue
process of your own?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I congratulate you. But surely
you must feel it beneath your dignity now
to behave rudely towards an old man.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, of course; yes. But
I’m all worn out with anxiety. You said
you were going to have me arrested, and
nothing’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Well, I may as well tell you the truth;
I meant to do so. But other people interfered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who interfered?”</p>

<p>“H’m! You know what women are.
There’s that daughter of mine, Elise. And
she said no.”</p>

<p>“That&mdash;that’s very strange,” said
Rolandsen.</p>

<p>Mack looked at the telegrams once more.
“This is excellent,” he said. “Couldn’t you
give me some idea of the thing itself?”</p>

<p>Rolandsen explained a little of the process.</p>

<p>“That means, we’re to some extent
competitors,” said Mack.</p>

<p>“Not to some extent only. From the
moment I’ve sent off my answer, we’re
competitors in earnest.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Mack started. “What do you
mean? Are you going to set up a factory
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s water-power higher up,
beyond your place, and more of it, and easier
to work.”</p>

<p>“But that’s Levion’s water.”</p>

<p>“I’ve bought it.”</p>

<p>Mack wrinkled up his forehead thoughtfully.
“Good! We’re competitors, then,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Said Rolandsen, “That means you will
lose.”</p>

<p>But Mack, the man of power, was growing
more and more offended; he was not
accustomed to this sort of thing, and not
disposed to put up with it.</p>

<p>“You’re strangely forgetful, young man;
you keep on forgetting that you’re in my
power,” said he.</p>

<p>“Do as you please. If you lock me up
now, my turn will come later, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what will you do then?”</p>

<p>“Ruin you,” said Rolandsen.</p>

<p>Frederik came in. He saw at once that
the two had been having words, and it
annoyed him that his father did not settle
this big-nosed ex-telegraph person out of
hand.</p>

<p>Then said Rolandsen aloud, “I will make
you an offer: we can take up this invention
together. Make the necessary alterations
in your factory, and I’ll take over the
management there. That’s my offer&mdash;and
it holds good for twenty-four hours!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Rolandsen strode out, leaving
the telegrams with Mack.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2>


<p>Autumn was setting in; the wind
rushing through the woods, the sea
yellow and cold, and a great awakening of
stars in the sky. But Ove Rolandsen had
no time now for watching meteor flights,
though he’d as great a fancy as ever for such
things. There had been gangs of men at
work on Mack’s factory of late, pulling down
here and setting up there, under orders from
Rolandsen, who managed it all. He had
settled all difficulties now, and was a man of
mark.</p>

<p>“I knew he would get on,” said Old
Mack. “I believed in him all along.”</p>

<p>“I did not,” said proud Elise. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
way he goes about now. It’s as if he’d
been the saving of us all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not as bad as that,” said Mack.</p>

<p>“He says a word of greeting when he
passes, but he never stops for a reply. He
just walks on.”</p>

<p>“Ah! he’s busy, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“He’s sneaked into the family, that’s what
he’s done,” said Elise, her lips a little pale.
“Wherever we are, he’s sure to be there too.
But if he’s any ideas in his head about me,
he’s very much mistaken.”</p>

<p>Elise went back to town.</p>

<p>And everything went on as usual, as if
one could do without her well enough. But
it was this way now with Rolandsen: from
the time he had entered into partnership
with Mack, he had promised himself to do
good work and not waste time in dreaming
of other things. Dreams and fancies for the
summer-time&mdash;and then best to stop. But
some go dreaming all their lives; go fluttering
mothwise all their lives, and never can make
an end. Now here was Jomfru van Loos in
Bergen. Rolandsen had had a letter from
her, to say she didn’t really never at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
make out as he was beneath her, seeing he
hadn’t demeaned himself with burglary and
thieving after all, but only doing it for
monkey tricks and fun. And that she took
back her words about breaking it off, if so
be it wasn’t too late and couldn’t be altered.</p>

<p>Elise Mack came home again in October.
It was said she was properly engaged
now, and her betrothed, Henrik Burnus
Henriksen, captain of the coasting vessel,
was visiting her. There was to be a grand
ball in the great hall at Rosengaard, and a
troupe of wandering musicians, on their
way down from Finmarken, had been hired
to play flutes and trumpets on the night.
All the village was invited, Rolandsen with
the rest, and Olga was to be there, and be
received as Frederik Mack’s intended. But
the Vicarage people were, unfortunately, prevented.
A new chaplain had been appointed,
and was expected every day, and
the present incumbent, good man, was going
elsewhere, up to the northward, where
another flock needed his care. He was not
altogether displeased to be going away now,
to plough and sow new ground; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
not always been happy in his work here.
He could look back upon a great deal
accomplished; he had got Levion’s sister to
call to mind the one man who owed her
marriage. It was the village carpenter, a
house-owner, a man of property, and with
money stored under his pillow. When the
priest joined them together before the altar,
it was with a feeling of satisfaction. After
all, unceasing toil might here and there bear
fruit among the benighted.</p>

<p>All things came right in time&mdash;and praise
the Lord, thought the priest. His household
was in something nearer order now, the new
housekeeper had come, and old and reliable
she was; he would take her with him and
keep her on at the new place. All would
come right in time, no doubt. The priest
had been a hard man to deal with, but none
seemed to bear him enmity for that. When
he stepped on board down at the waterside,
there were many had come to see him off.
As for Rolandsen, he would not let slip this
opportunity of showing courtesy. Mack’s
boat was there already with three men,
waiting for him, but he would not go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
board until the Vicarage folk had gone. In
spite of all, the priest could not but thank
him for so much consideration. And as Lay-helper
Levion had carried the new priest’s
lady ashore when first they came, so now he
carried her on board again as well. Matters
were looking brighter now for Levion, too,
seeing the priest had undertaken to say a
word for his reinstatement in his former post.</p>

<p>All would come right, no doubt.</p>

<p>“Now if you weren’t going north and I
south,” said Rolandsen, “we might go
together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the priest. “But let us
remember, my dear Rolandsen, that we may
go north and we may go south, but we shall
all meet again in one place at the last!”
Thus spoke the priest in priestly wise, and
was unshaken to the last.</p>

<p>Fruen sat in the stern, wearing the same
pitiful shoes; they had been patched, but
were grown most heartily ugly thereby.
Yet she was not downcast for that; far from
it; her eyes shone, and she was joyful at the
thought of coming to some new place, to
see what there might be. Though she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
not help feeling a wistful regret for a big
grey pebblestone that her husband would
not let her put in her trunk, for all it was
so pretty to see.</p>

<p>They pushed off from land, and there was
a waving of hats and sou’westers and handkerchiefs,
and calling “<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Farvel!</i>” from the
boat and from the shore.</p>

<p>Then Rolandsen went on board. He
had to be at Rosengaard that evening; a
double engagement was to be celebrated,
and here again he could not let slip the
chance of being polite. Mack’s boat had
no pennant at the mast, wherefore he
had borrowed a magnificent one of huge
dimensions on his own account, and had it
hoisted before setting out.</p>

<p>He came to Rosengaard that evening.
The great trading station was evidently
decked for a festival; there were lights in
the windows on both floors, and the ships
in the harbour were fluttering their flags,
though it was already dark. Rolandsen
said to his men, “Go ashore now, and send
three others to relieve; I shall be starting
back to the factory at midnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederik Mack came out at once to receive
him, and Frederik was in high spirits. He
had now every hope of getting that berth
as mate; then he would be able to marry,
and be something on his own account. Old
Mack too was pleased, and wore the decoration
given him by the King on the royal
visit to Finmarken. Neither Elise nor
Captain Henriksen were to be seen&mdash;cooing
somewhere by themselves, no doubt.</p>

<p>Rolandsen took a glass or so, and set
himself to be quiet and strong. He sat
down with Old Mack, and talked over various
matters of business: this dye-stuff, now,
that he had discovered; it had seemed a
trifle at first, but already it looked like
becoming a main product, perhaps the chief
of all. He needed machinery and plant,
apparatus for distilling. Elise came by; she
looked Rolandsen full in the face and said,
“<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Godaften</i>” out loud, and nodded. Rolandsen
stood up and bowed, but she walked by.</p>

<p>“She’s very busy this evening,” said
Mack.</p>

<p>“And we shall have to have everything in
readiness before the Lofoten fishing begins,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
said Rolandsen, sitting down again. Ho-ho!
He was not to be crushed, not to be in the
least put out by any sort of feeling!&mdash;“I still
think the best thing to do would be to charter
a small steamer and send up, with Frederik
as master.”</p>

<p>“Frederik may be getting another post
now. But we can talk it all over to-morrow;
there’s plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“I am going back to-night.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Mack. “There’s no
earthly need for that.”</p>

<p>Rolandsen stood up and said shortly,
“At midnight.” Firm and inflexible, that
was the way.</p>

<p>“Well, really, I had thought you would
stay the night. On a special occasion
like this. I think I may call it something
of a special occasion.”</p>

<p>They walked about among the others,
stopping to exchange a few words here
and there. Rolandsen encountered Captain
Henriksen, and they drank together as if
they had been old friends, though neither
had seen the other before. The Captain
was a cheery fellow, a trifle stout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the music struck up, tables were
laid in three rooms, and Rolandsen behaved
admirably in choosing himself a place well
apart from the most distinguished guests.
Mack, making a round of the tables,
found him there, and said, “What, are
you sitting here? Well, now, I was going
to....”</p>

<p>Said Rolandsen, “Not at all, thanks very
much; we can hear your speech quite nicely
from here.”</p>

<p>Mack shook his head. “No, I’m not
going to make any speech.” And he moved
off with a thoughtful air, as if something had
upset him.</p>

<p>The meal went on; there was much wine,
and a great buzz of voices. When the
coffee came round, Rolandsen started writing
out a wire. It was to Jomfru van Loos in
Bergen, to say it was by no means too late
and couldn’t be altered, come north soonest
possible.&mdash;Yours, <span class="smcap">Ove</span>.</p>

<p>And that was well, all things were excellently
well&mdash;delightful! He went down
himself to the station and sent off the wire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Then he went back to the house. There
was more life and movement about the
tables now; guests changed places; Elise
came through to where he sat, and offered
her hand. She begged him to excuse her
having passed by so hurriedly before.</p>

<p>“If you only knew how lovely you are
again this evening,” said he, and was calm
and polite.</p>

<p>“Do you think so, now?”</p>

<p>“I always did think so. I’m an old
admirer of yours, you know. Don’t you
remember last year, when I actually proposed
to you?”</p>

<p>But she did not seem to like his tone
now, and went away for the time being.
But a little later he came upon her again.
Frederik had led out his lady, the dancing
had begun, and no one took any notice of a
couple talking together.</p>

<p>Said Elise, “Oh, by the way, I’ve heard
from an old acquaintance of yours, Jomfru
van Loos.”</p>

<p>“Have you, though?”</p>

<p>“She heard I was going to be married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and wants to come and keep house for
me. I believe she’s a very good housekeeper.
But of course you know her better than
I do.”</p>

<p>“She is very clever, yes. But she can’t
come and keep house for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh...?”</p>

<p>“Seeing I’ve wired her this evening
offering her another post. She’s engaged
to me now.”</p>

<p>Proud Elise started at that, and looked
hard at him. “I thought it was over between
you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know what they say about
old love.... It <em>was</em> all over at one time,
but now....”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Elise.</p>

<p>Then said Rolandsen, magnificently polite,
“I can’t help saying you’ve never been
so lovely as you are to-night! And
then your dress, that dark-red velvet
dress....”</p>

<p>He felt very pleased with himself after
that speech; no one could ever imagine the
least unrest behind it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t seem to care so very much
for her,” said Elise.</p>

<p>He saw that her eyes were dewed, and he
winced. A little strangeness in her voice,
too, confused him, and the look on his face
changed suddenly.</p>

<p>“Where’s your splendid coolness now?”
she asked, and smiled.</p>

<p>“You’ve taken it,” he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she stroked his hand, a
single touch, and left him. She hurried
in through the rooms, seeing none and
hearing nothing, only hurrying on. In the
passage stood her brother, and he called
to her; she turned her all-smiling face full
towards him, and the tears dripped from
her lashes; then she ran upstairs to her
room.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later her father
came up. She flung her arms round his
neck and said, “I can’t!”</p>

<p>“Eh? No, no. But you must come
down again and dance; they’re asking after
you. And what have you been saying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Rolandsen? He’s changed so all in a
moment. Have you been rude to him
again?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, I wasn’t rude to him....”</p>

<p>“Because if you were, you’ll have to put
it right at once. He’s leaving at twelve
o’clock to-night.”</p>

<p>“Leaving at twelve!” Elise was ready in
a moment, and said, “I’m coming down
at once.”</p>

<p>She went downstairs, and found Captain
Henriksen.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said she.</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>“I dare say it’s so much the worse for me,
but I simply can’t.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” was all he said.</p>

<p>She could not give any further explanation,
and the Captain apparently having no
more to say, nothing more was said. Elise
went down to the telegraph station and
telegraphed Jomfru van Loos, Bergen,
not to accept Ove Rolandsen’s offer, same
being again not seriously meant. Await
letter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elise Mack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></span></p>

<p>Then she went home and joined the
dancers again.</p>

<p>“Is it true you’re leaving at twelve to-night?”
she asked Rolandsen.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going with you to the factory.
I’ve something to do there.”</p>

<p>And she stroked his hand once more.</p>

<p>Buchholtz is one of the most original of modern
Danish writers. His characters are creations of great
imaginative power and human interest; he brings
before us a gallery of varied personages; quaint and
yet true to life as those of Dickens. And he shows a
great fertility of invention in contriving for them the
most amazing situations.</p>

<p>The story of Egholm, the fantastic enthusiast and
inventor, his conflict with the remarkable “Brotherhood”
in one little town, and his extraordinary achievements
and failures in another, is one of the author’s
best, rich in humour and full of unexpected developments.</p>

<p>The book is one that should appeal to every class of
reader.</p>

<p>In this book, Laurids Bruun draws once more upon
the papers of his imaginary friend “Van Zanten,”
whose “Happy Days” on Pelli Island formed the
output of the first of this series.</p>

<p>“The Promised Isle,” however, is in a somewhat
different vein, describing, with a touch of delicate
satire, the adventures, and more especially the misadventures,
of a little party of enthusiasts who turn
from artificial society to seek true happiness and their
respective ideals on an uninhabited island in the South
Seas. The manner in which each of the friends faces
the self-imposed Crusoe-life, the expedients to which
they severally have recourse, the unexpected addition to
their number, and its effect, make a most entertaining
and amusing story.</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
