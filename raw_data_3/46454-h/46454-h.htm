<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p>"In Vain," the first literary work of Sienkiewicz,
was written before he had passed the eighteenth
year of his life and while he was studying
at Warsaw.</p>

<p>Though not included in his collected works
by the author, this book will be received with
much favor; of this I feel certain.</p>

<p>The first book of the man who wrote "With
Fire and Sword" and "Quo Vadis" will interest
those of his admirers who live in America and
the British Empire. These people are counted
at present by millions.</p>

<p>This volume contains pictures of student life
drawn by a student who saw the life which he
describes in the following pages. This student
was a person of exceptional power and exceptional
qualities, hence the value of that which
he gives us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">And</span> this is Kieff!"</p>

<p>Thus spoke to himself a young man named
Yosef Shvarts, on entering the ancient city,
when, roused by toll-gate formalities, he saw
himself unexpectedly among buildings and
streets.</p>

<p>The heart quivered in him joyfully. He
was young, he was rushing forward to life; and
so he drew into his large lungs as much fresh
air as he could find place for, and repeated
with a gladsome smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this is Kieff!"</p>

<p>The Jew's covered wagon rolled forward, jolting
along on the prominent pavement stones.
It was painful to Shvarts to sit under the canvas,
so he directed the Jew to turn to the nearest
inn, while he himself walked along by the side
of the wagon.</p>

<p>Torrents of people, as is usual in a city, were
moving in various directions; shops were glittering
with a show of wares; carriages were
passing one after another; merchants, generals,
soldiers, beggars, monks pushed along before
the eyes of the young man.</p>

<p>It was market-day, so the city had taken
on the typical complexion of gatherings of
that sort. There was nothing unconsidered
there; no movement, no word seemed to be
wasted. The merchant was going to his
traffic, the official to his office, the criminal
to deceit,&mdash;all were hastening on with some
well-defined object; all pushed life forward,
thinking of the morrow, hastening toward
something. Above that uproar and movement
was a burning atmosphere, and the sun
was reflected in the gleaming panes of great
edifices with just the same intensity as in any
little cottage window.</p>

<p>"This uproar is life," thought Shvarts, who
had never been in Kieff before, or in any large
city.</p>

<p>And he was thinking how immensely distant
was life in a little town from the broad scene
of activity in a great city, when a well-known
voice roused him from that meditation.</p>

<p>"Yosef, as God lives!"</p>

<p>Shvarts looked around, gazed some seconds
at the man who called him by name; at last
he opened his arms widely, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"As God lives, it is Gustav!"</p>

<p>Gustav was a man small and thin, about
twenty-three years of age; long hair of a chestnut
color fell almost to his shoulders; his
short reddish mustache cut even with his lip
made him seem older than he was in reality.</p>

<p>"What art thou doing, Yosef? Why hast
thou come? To the University, hast thou not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well done. Life is wretched for the man
without knowledge," said Gustav, as he panted.
"What course wilt thou choose?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell yet; I will see and decide."</p>

<p>"Think over it carefully. I have been here
a year now, and have had a chance to look at
things coolly. I regret much a choice made
too hastily, but what is one to do afterward?
Too late to turn back, to go on there is lack
of power. It is easier to commit a folly than
correct it. To-morrow I will go with thee to
the University; meanwhile, if thou hast no lodgings,
let the Jew take thy things to my room,
it is not far from here. Thou mayst begin with
me; when thou art tired of me, look for another
man."</p>

<p>Yosef accepted Gustav's offer, and in a few
moments they were in the narrow lodgings of
the student.</p>

<p>"Ei, it is long since we have seen each other.
We finished our school course a year ago,"
said Gustav, putting aside Yosef's small trunk
and bundle. "A year is some time. What hast
thou done this whole year?"</p>

<p>"I have been with my father, who would not
let me come to the University."</p>

<p>"What harm could that be to him?"</p>

<p>"He was a good man, though ignorant&mdash;a
blacksmith."</p>

<p>"But he has let thee come now?"</p>

<p>"He died."</p>

<p>"He did well," said Gustav, coughing.
"The cursed asthma is tormenting me these
six months. Dost wonder at my hard breathing?
Thou too wilt breathe hard when thou
hast bent over books as I have. Day after
day without rest for a moment. And fight
with poverty as one dog with another.&mdash;Hast
money?"</p>

<p>"I have. I sold the house and property
left by my father. I have two thousand
rubles."</p>

<p>"Splendid! For thee that will be plenty.
My position is poverty! Oh the cursed asthma!
Oi! that is true. One must learn. Barely a
little rest in the evening; the day at lectures,
the night at work. Not time enough for sleep.
That is the way with us. When thou enterest
our life, thou wilt see what a University is.
To-day I will take thee to the club, or simply
to the restaurant; thou must learn to know
our students immediately. Today, right away
thou wilt go with me."</p>

<p>Gustav circled about the room without intermission;
he panted and coughed. To look at
his bent shoulders, sunken visage, and long
hair, one might have taken him rather for a
man tortured by joyous life than by labor; but
the printed volumes and manuscripts in piles,
the poverty in the furnishing of the room, gave
more proof than was needed to show that the
occupant belonged to that species of night birds
who wither away while bent over books, and die
thinking whether a certain syllable should or
should not be accented.</p>

<p>But Yosef breathed the atmosphere of the
chamber with full breast; for him that was a
world at once new and peculiar. "Who
knows," thought he, "what ideas are flashing
through the heads of dwellers in fourth and
fifth stories? Who knows what a future those
garrets are preparing for science?"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt make the acquaintance to-day
of many of our fellows," said Gustav, drawing
out from beneath his bed a one-legged samovar
and putting a broken dish under it in place of
the two other legs. "But let not this evening
offend thee," continued the student, as he let
charcoal drop into the samovar. "I will make
tea. Let not heads partly crazy offend thee.
When thou hast looked round about at the
city, thou wilt discover that there is no lack
of fools here as in other places; but it moves
forward with no laggard steps. There is no
lack among us of originals, though there is
much that is empty and colorless. This last
is ridiculous, and the dullest of all the stupidities.
In some heads there are blazes of light,
in other heads darkness like that out of doors
at this moment."</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a time in the chamber;
there was no noise there save that made by
Gustav while puffing and blowing at the samovar.
In fact, night had been coming gradually,
on the walls and ceiling of the room an
increasing darkness was falling; the fiery circle
reflected from the samovar widened or narrowed
as Gustav blew or stopped blowing.
At last the water began to sound, to hiss, to
sputter. Gustav lighted a candle.</p>

<p>"Here is tea for thee. I will go now to the
lecture," continued he; "wait thou here, or
better sleep on my bed. When thy time to
pay money comes, thou wilt have also to look
after lectures. The work is dreary, but there
is no escape from it. Student life has its bitter
side, but why mention this in advance? Our
student world and the rest of society are entirely
separate. People here neither like nor
receive us, and we quarrel with all persons,
even with one another. Oh, life here is difficult!
If thou fall ill, no man, who is not a
student, will reach a hand to thee. This is
the fate of us poor fellows; moreover people
are angry because we play no comedies, we
call things by their names."</p>

<p>"Thou seest objects in black," remarked
Yosef.</p>

<p>"Black or not black," answered Gustav, with
bitterness, "thou wilt see. But I tell thee that
thou wilt not rest on roses. Youth has both
rights and demands. They will laugh in thy
eyes at these rights, these demands; they will
say that thou art not cooked enough, they
will call thy wants exaltation. But devil take
it, the name matters little if the thing it describes
hurts or pains thee. As to that thou
wilt see.&mdash;Pour tea for thyself, and lie down
to rest. I shall be here in an hour; and now
give me that hat, and good-by!"</p>

<p>For a while the panting, puffing, and steps
of Gustav were heard on the stairway. Yosef
was alone.</p>

<p>Those words of Gustav impressed his friend
strangely. Yosef remembered him as different.
To-day a certain disappointment and peevishness
were heard in his voice, mental gloom of
a certain kind broke through those words half
interrupted, half sad. Formerly he had been
healthy in mind and in body; to-day his
breathing was difficult, in his movements and
speech appeared wonderful feverishness, like
that of a man who is exhausted.</p>

<p>"Has life tortured him that much already?"
thought Yosef. "Then one must struggle here,
go against the current somewhat; but this poor
fellow had not the strength, it seems. A man
must conquer in this place. It is clear that
the world does not lay an over-light hand
on us. Devil take it! the question is no easy
one. Gustav is in some sort too misanthropic;
he must exaggerate rather easily. But he is
no idler and must go forward. Perhaps this
is only a mask, the misanthropy, under which
he finds his position more convenient and
safer. But really, if one must take things by
storm or perish? Ha, then I will go through!"
exclaimed the young man, with strength,
though in this interjection there was more
resolution than passion.</p>

<p>An hour after this monologue panting was
heard on the stairway a second time, and
Gustav entered, or rather pushed in.</p>

<p>"Now follow!" cried he. "Thou art about
to enter the vortex of student life; today thou
wilt see its gladder aspect. But lose no
time!"</p>

<p>While speaking, he turned his cap in his
hand, and cast his eyes on every side; finally
he went to a small table, and taking a comb
began to arrange his long yellow, or rather
his long faded hair.</p>

<p>At last they went out to the street.</p>

<p>At that time in Kieff there were restaurants
where students assembled. Circumstances
were such that it was not possible to live
with the city society. Those various city
circles were unwilling to receive young persons
whom the future alone was to form into
people. On the student side lack of steadiness,
violence of speech, insolence, and other
native traits usual to youth were not very
willing to bend themselves to social requirements;
as to the country, that furnished its
social contingent only in winter, or during the
time of the contracts. So the University was
a body entirely confined to itself, living a life
of books in the day, and leading a club life
at night. For many reasons there was more
good in this than evil, for though young men
went into the world without polish, they had
energy and were capable of action. Wearied
and worn-out individuals were not found among
them.</p>

<p>Our acquaintances passed through the
street quickly, and turned toward the gleaming
windows of a restaurant. Under the light
of the moon it was possible to distinguish the
broad, strong figure of Yosef near the bent
shoulders and large head of Gustav. The
latter hurried on in advance somewhat, conversing
with Yosef or with himself; at last
he halted under a window, seized the sill,
and drawing himself up examined the interior
carefully. Finally he dropped down, and said,
while wiping off whitewash from his knees,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is not there."</p>

<p>"Who is not there?"</p>

<p>"Either she has been there or she will not
come."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"What o'clock is it?"</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock. Whom art thou looking for
through the window?"</p>

<p>"The widow."</p>

<p>"The widow? Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I fear that she is sick."</p>

<p>"Is she thy acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Evidently. If I did not know her I should
not be occupied with her."</p>

<p>"Well, that is clear," answered Yosef.
"Let us go in."</p>

<p>He raised the door-latch; they entered.</p>

<p>A smoky, hot atmosphere surrounded them.
At some distance in the hall faces of various
ages were visible. Amid clouds of smoke,
which dimmed the light of the wall lamps, and
outbursts of laughter, wandered the tones of
a piano, as if wearied and indifferent. The
piano was accompanied by a guitar, on which
thrummed at intervals a tall, slender youth, with
hair cut close to his skull and with scars on
his face. He played with long fingers on the
strings carelessly, fixed his great blue eyes on
the ceiling, and was lost in meditation.</p>

<p>The person sitting at the piano had barely
grown out of childhood. He had a milk-white
complexion, dark hair combed toward the
back of his head, sweetness on his red lips, and
melancholy in his eyes. He was delicate, of a
slight build of body, and good looking. It was
evident that he had played a long time, for red
spots on both cheeks showed great weariness.</p>

<p>With their backs to the light stood a
number of men from the Pinsk region, all
strong as oaks, and at the same time so eager
for music of every sort given in the restaurant
that they formed a circle around the player,
drooped their heads, and listened with sighs
or delight.</p>

<p>Other young fellows were on benches or in
armchairs; a few tender girls, of the grasshopper
order who sing away a summer, circled
here and there. It was noisy; goblets clinked
in places. In the room next the hall some
were playing cards madly, and through a half-open
door the face of one player was visible.
Just then he was lighting a cigar at a candle
standing on the corner of a table, and the
flame either smothered or rising for an instant
shone on his sharply cut features.</p>

<p>The woman at the refreshment counter examined
near the light, with perfect indifference,
the point of the pen with which she entered
down daily sales; at her side, leaning on a
table, slumbered her assistant in wondrous
oblivion. A cat sitting on a corner of the
counter opened his eyes at moments, and then
closed them with an expression of philosophic
calm and dignity.</p>

<p>Yosef cast a glance around the assembly.</p>

<p>"Ho! How art thou, Yosef?" called a number
of voices.</p>

<p>"I am well. How are ye?"</p>

<p>"Hast come for good?"</p>

<p>"For good."</p>

<p>"I present him as a member of this respected
society. Do thou on thy part know once for
all the duty of coming here daily, and the privilege
of never sleeping in human fashion," said
Gustav.</p>

<p>"As a member? So much the better! Soon
thou wilt hear a speech.&mdash;Hei, there, Augustinovich,
begin!"</p>

<p>From that room of card-players came a
young man with stooping shoulders and a
head almost bald, ugly in appearance. He
threw his cap on a table, and sitting in an
armchair began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! If ye will not remain quiet,
I shall begin to speak learnedly, and I know,
my dear fellows, that for you there is nothing
on earth so offensive as learned discourses. In
Jove's name! Silence, I say, silence! I shall
begin to discourse learnedly."</p>

<p>Indeed, under the influence of the threat
silence reigned for a season. The speaker
looked around in triumph, and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! If we have met here, we have
met to seek in rest itself the remembrance of
bitter moments. ["Very well."] Some one will
say that we meet here every night. ["Very
well."] I come here nightly, and I do not
dream of denying it; I do not deny, either,
that I am here on this occasion! [Applause;
the speaker brightens and continues.] Silence!
Were I forced to conclude that every effort of
mine which is directed toward giving a practical
turn to our meetings is shattered by general
frivolousness, for I can call it general ["You
can, you can!"], not directed by the current
of universal agreement which breaks up in its
very beginning ["Consider, gentlemen, in its
very beginning"] the uniform efforts of individuals&mdash;if
efforts marked by the regular object
of uniting disconnected thoughts into
some organic whole, will never issue from the
region of imagination to the more real field of
action, then, gentlemen, I am the first, and I
say that there are many others with me who
will agree to oppose the sense of the methods
of our existence so far [Applause], and will
take other methods ["Yes, yes!"] obliging, if
not all, at least the chosen ones [Applause]."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Yosef.</p>

<p>"A speech," answered Gustav, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"With what object?"</p>

<p>"But how does that concern any one?"</p>

<p>"What kind of person is he?"</p>

<p>"His name is Augustinovich. He has a
good head, but at this moment he is drunk,
his words are confused. He knows, however,
what he wants, and, as God lives, he is right."</p>

<p>"What does he want?"</p>

<p>"That we should not meet here in vain, that
our meetings should have some object. But
those present laugh at the object and the
speech. Of necessity the change would bring
dissension into the freedom and repose which
thus far have reigned in these meetings."</p>

<p>"And what object does Augustinovich wish
to give them?"</p>

<p>"Literary, scientific."</p>

<p>"That would be well."</p>

<p>"I have told him that he is right. If some
one else were to make the proposal, the thing
would pass, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well, but in his case."</p>

<p>"On everything that he touches he leaves
traces of his own ridiculousness and humiliation.
Have a care, Yosef! Thou in truth art
not like him in anything so far as I know, but
here any man's feet may slip, if not in one, in
another way."</p>

<p>Gustav looked with misty eyes on Augustinovich,
shrugged his shoulders, and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fate fixed itself wonderfully on that man.
I tell thee that he is a collection of all the
capacities, but he has little character. He has
lofty desires, but his deeds are insignificant, an
eternal dissension. There is no balance between
his desires and his strength, hence he
attains no result."</p>

<p>A number of Yosef's acquaintances approached;
at the glass conversation grew
general. Yosef inquired about the University.</p>

<p>"Do all the students live together?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," answered one of the Lithuanians.
"There are people here of all the
most varied conceptions, hence there are various
coteries."</p>

<p>"That is bad."</p>

<p>"Not true! I admit unity as to certain
higher objects; the unity of life in common
is impossible, so there is no use in striving
for it."</p>

<p>"But the German Universities?"</p>

<p>"In those are societies which live in themselves
only. A life of feelings and thoughts,
at least among us, should agree with practice;
therefore dissension in feelings and thoughts
produces dissension in practice."</p>

<p>"Then will you never unite?"</p>

<p>"That, again, is something different. We
shall unite in the interest of the University, or
in that which concerns all. For that matter,
I think that the contradictions which appear
prove our vitality; they are a sign that we
live, feel, and think. In that is our unity;
that which separates unites us."</p>

<p>"Under what banner do you stand, then?"</p>

<p>"Labor and suffering. We have no distinguishing
name. Those who are peasant
enthusiasts call us 'baker's apprentices.'"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"According to facts. Life will teach thee
what these mean. Each one of us tries to live
where there is a bakery, to become acquainted
with the baker, and gain credit with him.
That is our method; he trusts us. The majority
of us eat nothing warm, but a cake
on credit thou wilt get as long as thou
wishest."</p>

<p>"That is pleasant!"</p>

<p>"Besides our coterie, which is not united by
very strong bonds, there are peasant enthusiasts.
Antonevich organized and formed
them. Rylski and Stempkovski led them for
a time, but today these are all fools who
know not what they want, they talk Little Russian
and drink common vodka&mdash;that is the
whole matter."</p>

<p>"And what other coteries are there?"</p>

<p>"Clearly outlined, there are no more; but
there are various shades. Some are connected
by a communion of scientific ideas, others
by a common social standpoint. Thou wilt
find here democrats, aristocrats, liberals, ultra-montanes,
frolickers, women-hunters, idlers,
if thou wish, and finally sunburnt laborers."</p>

<p>"Who passes for the strongest head?"</p>

<p>"Among students?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That depends on the branch. Some say
that Augustinovich knows much; I will add
that he does not know it well. For connected
solid work and science Gustav is
distinguished."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"But they talk variously about him. Some
cannot endure him. By living with him thou
wilt estimate the man best,&mdash;for example, his
relations with the widow. That is a sentimental
bit of conduct; another man would not
have acted as he has. Indeed, it is not easy
to get on with her now."</p>

<p>"I have heard Gustav speak of her, but tell
me once for all, what sort of woman is she?"</p>

<p>"She is a young person acquainted with all
of us. Her history is a sad one. She fell in
love with Potkanski, a jurist, and loved him
perhaps madly. I do not remember those
times&mdash;I remember Potkanski, however. He
was a gifted fellow, very wealthy and industrious;
in his day he was the idol of his
comrades. How he came to know Helena, I
cannot tell you; it is explained variously. This
only is certain, that they loved each other
to the death. She was not more than eighteen
years of age. At last Potkanski determined to
marry her. It is difficult to describe what his
family did to prevent him, but Potkanski, an
energetic man, stuck to his point, and married
her despite every hindrance. Their married
life lasted one year. He fell ill of typhoid
on a sudden, and died leaving her on the
street as it were, for his family seized all his
property. A child which was living when he
died, died also soon after. The widow was left
alone, and had it not been for Gustav&mdash;well,
she would have perished."</p>

<p>"What did Gustav do?"</p>

<p>"Gustav did wonders. With wretched
means he prosecuted the Potkanskis. God
knows whether he would have won the case,
for that is a family of magnates, but he did this
much: to avoid scandal, they engaged to pay
the widow a slight life annuity."</p>

<p>"He acquitted himself bravely!"</p>

<p>"Of course he did, of course he did! Leave
that to him! What energy! And remember
it was during his first year at the University,
without acquaintances, in a strange city, without
means. And it is this way, my dear: a
rich man can, a poor man must, help himself."</p>

<p>"But what obligation had he toward the
widow?"</p>

<p>"He was Potkanski's friend, but that is still
little; he loved her before she became Potkanski's
wife, perhaps, but held aloof; now he
makes no concealment."</p>

<p>"But she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, from the time of the misfortunes
through which she passed the woman has
fallen into utter torpor; she has become insane
simply. She does not know what is happening
to her, she is indifferent to everything. But
beyond doubt thou wilt see her on this occasion,
for she comes here every evening."</p>

<p>"And with what object?"</p>

<p>"I say that she is a maniac. The report is
that she made the acquaintance of Potkanski
here, so now she does not believe, it seems,
that he is dead, and she goes around everywhere,
as maniacs do usually. In fact, were he
to rise from the dead, and not go to her
straightway, she would surely find him here,
nowhere else. We remind her, perhaps, of
Potkanski; many students used to visit them."</p>

<p>"Does Gustav permit her to come here?"</p>

<p>"Potkanski never would have permitted her
to come, but Gustav does not forbid her anything."</p>

<p>"How does she treat Gustav?"</p>

<p>"Like a table, a bench, a plate, or a ball of
thread. She seems not to see him, but she
does not avoid him,&mdash;she is always indifferent,
apathetic. That must pain him, but it is his
affair.&mdash;Ah! there she is! that woman coming
in on the right."</p>

<p>When the widow entered, it grew somewhat
silent. The appearance of that mysterious
figure always produced an impression. Of
stature a little more than medium, slender; she
had a long face, bright blond hair, and dark
eyes; her shoulders and bosom were rather
slight, but she had the round plumpness of
maiden forms; a forehead thrown back in a
way scarcely discernible. She was pensive,
and as dignified as if of marble. Her eyes,
deeply set beneath her forehead, as it were in
a shadow, were pencilled above with one delicate
arch of brow. Those eyes were marvellous,
steel-colored; they gleamed like polished
metal, but that was a genuine light of steel. It
was light and nothing more; under the glitter
warmth and depth of thought were lacking.
One might have said of those eyes, "They
look, but they see not." They gave no idea of
an object, they only reflected it. They were
cold beyond description; we will add that their
lids almost never blinked, but the pupils possessed
a certain movement as if investigating,
inquiring, seeking; still the movement was
mechanical.</p>

<p>The rest of the widow's face answered to her
eyes. Her mouth was pressed downward a
little, as might be the case in a statue; the
complexion monotonous, dull, pale, had a
swarthy tinge. She was neither very charming
nor very beautiful; she was accurately
pretty.</p>

<p>This in the woman was wonderful, that
though her face was torpid apparently, she
had in her whole person something which
attracted the masculine side of human nature
inexplicably. In that lay her charm. She
was statuesque to the highest degree, but to
the highest degree also a woman. She attracted
and also repelled. Gustav felt this
best. It was difficult to reconcile with that
cold torpor the impression which she produced,
which seemed as it were not of her,
but aside from her.</p>

<p>She was like a sleeping flower; pain had so
put her to sleep. In reality the blows which
she had received were like strokes of an axe
on the head. Let us remember that in the
career of the woman brief moments of happiness
were closed by two coffins. As a maiden
she had loved; he whom she had loved was no
longer alive. As a wife she had given birth to
a child; the child was dead. That which
law had given her, which had been the cause
and effect of her life, had vanished. Thenceforth
she ceased to live, she only existed.
Imagine a plant which is cut at the top
and the root; such was Helena. Torn from
the past and debarred from the future, at
first she bore within her a dim belief that a
shameful injustice had been wrought on her.
At the moment of her pain she threw out,
it is difficult to know at whom, this question,
as unfathomable as the bottomless pit:
Why has this happened? No answer came
from the blue firmament, or the earth, or
the fields, or the forest; the injustice remained
injustice. The sun shone and the
birds sang on as before. Then that unfortunate
heart withdrew into itself with its own
pain and became deadened.</p>

<p>No answer came, but her mind grew diseased&mdash;she
lost belief in the death of her husband,
she thought that he had taken the weeping
child in his arms and gone somewhere, but
that he might return any moment. Then,
altogether incapable of another thought, she
sought him with that bitter mechanical movement
of the eyes. She went to the restaurant,
thinking to find him there where she had made
his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately she did not die, but found a
valiant arm which strove to snatch her from
error, and a breast which wished to give her
warmth. The effort was vain, but it saved her
life. Gustav's love secured her rescue and
protection, as it were by the tenure of a spider-web
which did not let her go from the earth.
His voice cried to her, "Stay," and though
there was no echo in her, she remained,
without witness of herself, indifferent, a thing,
not a human being.</p>

<p>Such was the widow.</p>

<p>She entered the room and stood near the
door, like a stone statue, in gloomy majesty.
It was warm and smoky around her, the last
sounds of a song were quivering in the air yet.
A little coarse and a little dissolute was the
song, and on that impure background bloomed
the widow like a water-lily on a turbid pool.</p>

<p>Silence came. They respected her in that
place. In her presence even Augustinovich
became endurable. Some remembered Potkanski,
others inclined their heads before her
misfortune. There were also those who
revered her beauty. The assembly assumed
in her presence its seemliest aspect.</p>

<p>Gustav brought up an armchair to Pani
Helena, and taking her warm shawl went to
a corner to Yosef, who, attracted and astonished,
turned his gleaming eyes at the widow.</p>

<p>Gustav began a conversation with him.</p>

<p>"That is she," said he, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Do not show thyself to her much. The
poor woman! every new face brings her disappointment,
she is always looking for her
husband."</p>

<p>"Art thou acquainted with her long?"</p>

<p>"This is the second year. I was a witness
and best man at Potkanski's wedding." Gustav
smiled bitterly. "Since his death I see her
daily."</p>

<p>"Vasilkevich says that thou hast given her
aid and protection."</p>

<p>"I have, and I have not; some one had to
attend to that, and I occupied myself with it;
but such protection as mine&mdash;Do what is
possible, work, fly, run&mdash;misery upon misery!
so that sometimes despair seizes hold of a
man."</p>

<p>"But the family?"</p>

<p>"What family?"</p>

<p>"His."</p>

<p>"They injure her!" cried Gustav, with
violence.</p>

<p>"But they are rich, are they not?"</p>

<p>"Aristocrats! Hypocrites! They and I
have not finished yet. They will remember
long the injustice done to this dove. Listen
to me, Yosef. Were a little child of that family
to beg a morsel of bread of me from hunger,
I would rather throw the bread to a dog."</p>

<p>"Oh, a romance!"</p>

<p>"Wrong me not, Yosef. I am poor, I
waste no words. Potkanski when in the
hospital regained consciousness just before
death, and said, 'Gustav, to thee I leave
my wife; care for her.' I answered, 'I will
care for her.' 'Thou wilt not let her die of
hunger?' 'I will not,' said I. 'Let no one
offend her; take vengeance on any one who
tries to do her an injury.' 'As God is merciful
in life to me, I will avenge her,' said I. He
quenched after that, like a candle. There thou
hast the whole story."</p>

<p>"Not the whole story, not all, brother!"</p>

<p>"Vasilkevich told thee the rest. Very well!
I will repeat the same to thee. I have no one
on earth, neither father nor mother. I myself
am in daily want, and she alone binds me
to life." He indicated the widow with his
eyes.</p>

<p>And here Yosef, little experienced yet,
had a chance to estimate what passion is when
it rises in a youthful breast and adds fire to
one's blood. That dry and bent Gustav
seemed to him at that moment to gain strength
and vigor; he seemed to him loftier, more
manly; he shook his hair as a lion shakes his
mane, and on his face a flush appeared.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," began Vasilkevich, "the
hour is late, and sleep is not awaiting all of us
after leaving this meeting-place. One more
song, and then whoso wishes may say his good-night."</p>

<p>He of the maiden face who sat at the piano
struck some well-known notes, then a few
youthful voices sounded, but afterward a
whole chorus of them raised the song dear
to students, "Gaudeamus" (Let us rejoice).</p>

<p>Yosef went nearer the piano than others.
He stood with his side face turned to the
widow, under the light; but the lamp hanging
near the wall cast his profile in one line of
light. After a while the widow's eyes fell
on that line, connecting it unquietly with her
own thoughts. On a sudden she rose, as pale
as marble, with a feverish gleam in her eyes,
stretched forth her arms, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Kazimir, I have found thee!"</p>

<p>In her voice were heard hope, alarm, joy,
and awakening. All were silent. Every eye
turned toward Yosef, and a quiver ran through
those who had known Potkanski. In the light
and shade that tall, strong figure seemed a
repetition of the dead man.</p>

<p>"I was not careful," muttered Gustav, on
his way home about daybreak. "H'm! well,
her trouble has passed, but she was excited!
He is really like him&mdash;The devils take it!
But the cursed asthma stifles me to-day."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yosef</span> meditated long over the choice of his
course. "I have given my clear word of
honor not to waste myself in life, therefore I
meditate," said he to Vasilkevich.</p>

<p>And here it must be confessed that the
University roused him in no common manner.
From various points of the world youth journeyed
thither, like lines of storks. Some were
entering to satisfy their mental thirst, others
were going away. Some hurried in to gain
knowledge as bees gather honey. They assembled,
they scattered, they went in crowds,
they drew from science, they drew from themselves,
they drew from life. They gave animation
and they received it, they spared life
or they squandered it, they pressed forward,
they halted, they fell, they conquered, and
they were broken with their lives. Bathing in
that sea, some of them were drowned, others
swam to shore. Movement, uproar, activity
dominated immensely.</p>

<p>The University was like a general ovarium
where brains were to be propagated. It
opened every year, giving forth ripe fruits, and
taking in straightway new nurslings. Men
were born there a second time. It was beautiful
to see how youth, like waves of water,
rolled forth to the world yearly, bearing light
to the ignorant, as it were provisions to the
human field. To such a sea the boat of life
brought Yosef. Where was he to attach himself?
Various courses of study, like harbors,
enticed him. Whither was he to turn? He
meditated long; at last he sailed in.</p>

<p>He chose the medical course.</p>

<p>"Happen what may, I must be rich," said
he, deciding the question of choice.</p>

<p>But this decision was only because Yosef,
with his open mind, had immense regard
for the secrets of science. Both literature
and law attracted him, but natural sciences
he looked on as the triumph of human
thought. He had brought even from school
this opinion of those sciences. In his school
there had been a young teacher of chemistry,
a great enthusiast, who, placing his hand on
his heart, spoke thus one day to those of his
pupils who were finishing their course,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe me, my boys, except natural
science there is nothing but guesswork."</p>

<p>It is true that the prefect of the school while
closing religious exercises, affirmed that only
the science of the Church can bring man to
everlasting happiness. At this Yosef, whom
the prefect had already called a "vile heretic,"
made such an ugly grimace that he roused
the laughter of all who were present, but he
drew down on his own head thunders partly
deserved.</p>

<p>So he chose the medical course.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich influenced him in this regard.
Vasilkevich, a student himself, had, rightly or
wrongly, an immense influence on his comrades.
It happened that at a students' talk
a certain grammarian, a philologist, showed
with less truth than hypocrisy that a man
given to science should devote himself to it
exclusively, forget the world, forget happiness,
and incarnate himself in science,&mdash;be
simply its expression, its basis, its word. In
this deduction there was more of false enthusiasm
and stiltedness than sincerity. "People
tell us," continued the speaker, "that an Icelandic
fisherman, who had forgotten himself in
gazing at the aurora borealis, did not guard
against currents. The waters bore him away
to deep places, and he, with eyes fixed on
those northern lights, became entirely ruddy
in their gleams, till at last the spirit of the
abyss bore him away and confined him under
the glassy wave, but in the fisherman's eyes
the lights remained pictured.</p>

<p>"There is science and life!" added he.
"The man who has once inclined his forehead
before science may let the waves of life
bear him to any depth, the light will remain
with him."</p>

<p>There are principles in the world which one
does not recognize, but to come out against
them a man needs no small share of courage.
So among students one and another were
silent, but Vasilkevich panted angrily and rose
from his seat; at last he burst out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tfu! empty words! Let a German consort
himself in that way with science, not us!
In my mind science is for men, not men for
science. Let the German turn himself into
a parchment. Thy fisherman was a fool. If
he had worked with his oar, he might have
seen the lights and brought fish to his children.
But again look at the question in this way:
Poor people suffer and perish from hunger
and cold, and wilt thou tear thyself free of the
world and be for men a burden instead of an
assistance?</p>

<p>"Oi, Tetvin, Tetvin!" This was the name
of the previous speaker. "Consider the sense,
not the sound of thy words. Thou art able
to unite folly with reason! To-day it seems
to thee that thou wilt predict luck from a
few faded cards. Not true! When the moment
comes and thy breast aches about the
heart, thou wilt yearn honestly for happiness
in love. For example, in Lithuania, I have
a pair of old people in a cottage, my father
and mother, as white as doves, and one of
them says to the other things of me which
are beyond my merits, things which might be
told of a golden king's son. What would
my worth be were I to shut myself up in a
book, not think of them, and neglect them in
their old age? None whatever.&mdash;Well, I
come here and I forget neither science nor
them nor myself. And I am not alone.
Every man who tills a field has the right to
eat bread from it. That to begin with! Science
is science; let not a scholar tear himself
loose from life, let him not be an incompetent.
A scholar is a scholar; but if he cannot
button his shirt, if he does not support
his own children, and has no care for his
wife? Why not reconcile the practice of
life with science? Why not bring science
into one's career and enliven science itself
with life?"</p>

<p>Thus spoke Vasilkevich. He spoke and
panted with excitement.</p>

<p>The point is not in this whether he spoke
truth or falsehood; we have repeated the conversation
because Yosef, by nature inclined to
be practical, took it to heart; he considered,
meditated, thought, and chose the medical
course.</p>

<p>Happen what may, a man brings to the
world certain tendencies.</p>

<p>Yosef's mind was realistic by nature, in
some way he clung rather to things than
ideas&mdash;he had therefore no love for dialectics
of any sort. He preferred greatly to see an
object as it was, and had no wish to have it
seem better than it was. The movement of
mind in men's heads is of two sorts: one starts
eternally from the centre of existence, the other
refers each object to some other. Men of the
first kind enter into things already investigated,
and give them life by connecting them with
the main source of existence by a very slender
thread of knowledge. The first are the so-called
creative capacities; the second grasp
things in some fashion, compare them, classify
them, and understand them only through arranging
and bringing them into classes,&mdash;those
are the scientific capacities. The first men
are born to create, the second to investigate.
The difference between them is like that between
a spendthrift and a miser, between
exhaling and inhaling. It is difficult to tell
which is the better: the first have the gift
of creating; the second of developing, and
above all of digesting. In the second this
is active; true, the stomach has that power
also. A perfect balance between these powers
constitutes genius. In such a case there is a
natural need of broad movements.</p>

<p>Yosef had the second capacity, the classifying.
He not only had it, but he knew that he
had it; this conviction preserved him in life
from many mistakes, and gave a certain balance
to his wishes and capacities. He never undertook
a thing that for him was impossible. He
calculated with himself. And, finally, he had
much enthusiasm, which in his case might have
been called persistence in science. Having
a mind which was fond of examining everything
soberly, he wanted to see everything
well; but to see well one must know thoroughly.
He was unable to guess, he wished
to know.</p>

<p>This was why he never learned anything
half-way. As a spider surrounds a fly, he surrounded
his subject of investigation diligently
with a network of thought, he drew it into
himself; it might be said that he sucked it out
of the place where it was and finally digested
it. His thoughts had also a high degree of
activity. He desired, a natural attribute of
youth. He was free of conceit. Frequently
he rejected an opinion accepted by all,
specially for this reason, that it had importance
behind it. It must be confessed, however,
that in this case he endeavored to find
everything that was against it; when he did
not find enough, he yielded. He had, besides,
no little energy in thinking and doing.</p>

<p>All this composed his strength, his weapon,
partly acquired, partly natural. We forgot to
say that he had in addition two thousand
rubles.</p>

<p>When he had estimated these supplies, he
betook himself to medicine. But the greater
the enthusiasm with which he betook himself
to his specialty the more was he disenchanted
at first. He wanted to know, but now only
memory was required. In that case any man
might succeed; at least it was a question of
memory and will, not of reason. One needed
a memory of the eyes, a memory of the hands;
one had to put into the head seriously the first
and second and tenth, from time to time like
grain into a storehouse. That was well-nigh
the work of a handicraftsman; the mental
organism gained no profit from these supplies,
for it did not digest nor work them
over. Nutrition was lacking there. The philosophy
of the physical structure of organisms
may be compared in subtlety and in immensity
of result with all others; but Yosef was only
beginning to become acquainted with the organism
itself; indications as to whether there
existed any philosophy of those sciences were
not given him thus far.</p>

<p>But having once begun he had to wade
farther. He waded. But the technical side
of scientific labor was disagreeable, thankless,
full of hidden difficulties and unexpected secrets,
frequently obscure, often barely visible,
most frequently repelling, always costing labor.
One might have said that nature had declared
war against the human mind at this
stage. Yosef struggled with these moral difficulties,
but he advanced. That technic had
a gloomy side also in his eye: it had an
evil effect morally.</p>

<p>It disclosed the end of life without indicating
whether a continuation existed. The veil
was removed from death without the least
hesitation. All the deformity of that subterranean
toiler was exhibited with unconcealed
insolence. That which remained of
the dead was also a cynical promise to the
living. Death appeared to say in open daylight,
"Till we meet in the darkness!" This
seemed an announcement bearing terrible
proofs of the helplessness of man before an
implacable, malicious, loathsome, and shameless
power. This power when seen face to
face, roused in young minds a violent reaction,&mdash;a
reaction expressed in the following
manner: "Let us lose no time, let us
make use of life, for sooner or later the
devils will take everything!"</p>

<p>In such occupations delicacy of feeling
was dimmed by degrees; indifference was degraded
to coarseness, ambition to envy, love
passed into passion, passion into impulse.
Love was like the sun seen through a smoked
glass; one felt the heat, but saw not the
radiance.</p>

<p>Yosef warded off these impressions; he
shook himself free of them, he cast them
away, and went forward.</p>

<p>Finally, he had to be true to his principle.
He who has confidence in one career has not
in another; that which he has chosen seems
best to him. In that which Yosef had chosen
everything from the time of Hippocrates downward
reposed on experience. Seeing, hearing,
tasting, smelling, and feeling are the only criteria
on which the whole immense structure
stands even in our day.</p>

<p>So men believe, especially young men, as
the most different in everything from their
elders. All that has come to science by ways
aside from experience, is doubtful. Each man
judges according to his own thought the ideas
of others. The hypothesis of anything existing
outside of experience, even if true, seems
through such a glass frivolous. "Only investigated
things have existence. The connection
between cause and effect is a necessity
of thought, but only in man. History is a
chronicle more or less scandalous; law rests
on experience of modes of living in society,
speculation is a disease of the mind."</p>

<p>Yosef did not ward off these thoughts, since
they did not hinder him in advancing.</p>

<p>As to the rest he worked on.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A month</span> passed.</p>

<p>The evening was fair, autumnal; the sun was
quenching slowly on the towers of Kieff and
on the distant grave-mounds of the steppe.
Its light was still visible on the roof above
Yosef and Gustav. Both were bent over their
work and, sitting in silence, used the last rays
of evening with eagerness. Gustav had returned
from the city not long before; he was
suffering and pale, he panted more than usual.
On his face a certain uneasiness was manifest,
vexation, even pain; this he strove to conceal,
but still it was evident from the fever of his
eyes. Both men were silent. It was clear,
however, that Gustav wished to break the
silence, for he turned to Yosef frequently; but
since it seemed as though the first word could
be spoken only with difficulty, he sank back
to his book again. At last evident impatience
was expressed on his face; he seized his cap
from the table, and rose.</p>

<p>"What o'clock is it now?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>"Why art thou not going to the widow's?
Thou goest every day to visit her."</p>

<p>Yosef turned toward Gustav,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was at her request that I went with thee
to her lodgings the first time. Let us not
mention the subject. I do not care to speak of
that which would be disagreeable to both of
us; for that matter, we understand each other
perfectly. I will not see the widow to-day, or
to-morrow, or any day. Thou hast my word
and hand on that."</p>

<p>They stood then in silence, Yosef with extended
hand. Gustav, hesitating and disturbed
by the awkward position, finally pressed the
palm of his comrade.</p>

<p>Evidently words came to both with difficulty;
one did not wish to use heartfelt expressions,
the other heartfelt thanks. After a while they
parted.</p>

<p>Men's feelings are strange sometimes, and
the opposite of those which would seem the
reward of noble deeds. Yosef promised Gustav
not to see Pani Helena, the widow. Whether
he loved her or not, that was a sacrifice on his
part, for in his toilsome and monotonous existence
she was the only bright point around
which his thought loved to circle. Though
thinking about her was only the occupation
of moments snatched from hard labor and
devoted to rest and mental freedom, to renounce
such moments was to deprive rest of
its charm, it was to remove a motive from life
at a place where feeling might bud out and
blossom.</p>

<p>Yosef, after thinking a little, did this without
hesitation. He made a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Still, when Gustav had gone from the room,
there was on Yosef's face an expression of distaste,
even anger. Was that regret for the past,
or for the deed done a moment before?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>When he extended his hand to Gustav, the
latter hesitated in taking it. Not to accept a
sacrifice given by an energetic soul is to cover
the deed of sacrifice itself with a shadow of
ridicule; and this in the mind of him who
makes the sacrifice is to be ungrateful, and to
cast a grain of deep hatred into the rich field
of vanity.</p>

<p>But to accept a rival's sacrifice is for a soul
rich in pride to place one's own "I" under the
feet of some other man morally; it is to receive
small coppers of alms thrust hastily into a
hand which had not been stretched forth for
anything.</p>

<p>Pride prefers to be a creditor rather than a
debtor.</p>

<p>Therefore Gustav when on the street twisted
his mouth in bitter irony, and muttered through
his pressed lips.</p>

<p>Better and better. Favor, favor! Bow down
now to Pan Yosef daily, and thank him. A
pleasant life for thee, Gustav!</p>

<p>And he fell into bitter, deep meditation. He
ceased even to think of himself, he was merely
dreaming painfully. He felt a kind of gloomy
echo in his soul, while striving to summon up
the remembrance of even one happy moment.
That echo sounded in him like a broken chord.
The mind and soul in the man were divided.
One tortured half cried hurriedly for rest; the
other half, energetic and gloomy, strove toward
life yet. One half of his mind saw light and
an object; the other turned moodily toward
night and nothingness. To finish all, there
was something besides in this sorrowing man
which made sport of its own suffering; something
like a malicious demon which with one
hand indicated his own figure to him, pale,
ugly, bent, and pointed out with the other, as
it were in the clouds in the brightness of
morning, Helena Potkanski, in marble repose,
in splendid beauty.</p>

<p>Torn apart with the tumult of this internal
battle, he went forward alone, almost without
knowing whither. Suddenly he heard
behind a well-known voice singing in bass
the glad song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"Hop! hop! hop! hop!</p>
<p>And the horseshoe firmly fastened."</p>
</div>

<p>He looked around&mdash;it was Vasilkevich and
Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"Whither art thou hastening, Gustav?"
asked the first.</p>

<p>"I? Ha! whither&mdash;" He looked at his
watch. "It is too early to visit Pani Helena.
I am going at present to the club."</p>

<p>"Well, go straight to the widow."</p>

<p>"What? Why?"</p>

<p>"Woe!" exclaimed Augustinovich, raising
his hand toward heaven; and without noticing
passers-by, he fell to declaiming loudly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"The castle where joyousness sounded</p>
<p>Is shrouded in mourning to-day;</p>
<p>On its wall the wild weeds are growing,</p>
<p>At its gate the faithful dog howls."</p>
</div>

<p>"Thou hast no reason to visit the club,"
added Vasilkevich.</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Gloom is there now incubating a tempest,"
replied Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"But say what has happened."</p>

<p>"Misfortune."</p>

<p>"Of what sort?"</p>

<p>"Ghastly!"</p>

<p>"Vasilkevich, speak in human fashion!"</p>

<p>"The University government has closed our
club. Some one declared that students assemble
there."</p>

<p>"When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Two hours since."</p>

<p>"We must go there and learn on the
spot."</p>

<p>"I do not advise thee to do so. They will
put thee in prison."</p>

<p>"They will bind thy white palms with a
rope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Augustinovich, be quiet! Why did they
not do this in the evening? They might have
caught us all like fish in a net."</p>

<p>"Well, they cared more for closing the club
than for seizing us; but were a man to go now,
beyond doubt they would seize him."</p>

<p>"But whither are ye going?"</p>

<p>"We are going with a watchword of alarm;
the clans send a fiery cross&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak low, I beg thee!"</p>

<p>"Yes, valiant Roderic."</p>

<p>"True, true," interrupted Vasilkevich; "we
are on the way to warn others, so farewell, or
go with us."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Where wilt thou go?"</p>

<p>"To Pani Helena's."</p>

<p>"Farewell."</p>

<p>"Till we meet again!"</p>

<p>When he was alone, Gustav rubbed his
hands, a smile of satisfaction lighted up his
gloomy face for a moment. He was pleased
with the closing of the club, for he ceased
to fear that Helena, on learning of Yosef's decision,
might wish to visit the club to see him
there. His fears were well founded. Gustav
remembered that despite prayers and arguments
he had barely, by the promise of bringing
Yosef to her lodgings, been able to restrain
her from this improper step. Now he had
no cause for fear.</p>

<p>After a while he pulled the bell at the
widow's dwelling.</p>

<p>"How is thy mistress?" asked he of the
servant girl.</p>

<p>"She is well, but walking in the room and
talking to herself."</p>

<p>Gustav entered.</p>

<p>Pani Helena's dwelling was composed of two
narrow chambers, with windows looking out
on a garden; the first chamber was a small
drawing-room, the second she used as a bed-chamber,
which Gustav now entered. The
upper part of the window in the bed-chamber
was divided by a narrow strip of wood from
the lower part, and had colored panes arranged
in the form of a flower, blue and red alternately.
In one corner stood a small mahogany table
covered with a soft velvet spread. On the table
stood two portraits; one in an inlaid wooden
frame represented a young man with a high
forehead, blond hair, and handsome aristocratic
features,&mdash;that was Potkanski; the other
was Pani Helena. On her knees was her little
daughter dressed in white. Before the portraits
lay a garland of immortelles entwined
with crape and with a sprig of dry myrtle.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the room, between
two beds divided by a narrow space, was a
small cradle, now empty, once filled with the
twittering and noise of an infant. Its cover,
colored green by the light of the panes, seemed
to move slightly. One might have thought
that a little hand would be thrust out any moment,
and a joyous head look at its mother.</p>

<p>Silent sadness was in the atmosphere of the
place. The leaves of the acacia which looked
in through the window were outlined darkly on
the floor, and, moved by the wind, yielded to
the quivering light and returned again. Near
the door was a small statuette, representing the
angel of baptism with hands extended as if to
bless; at its feet was a holy-water pot.</p>

<p>At the moment of which we are speaking
the head of the angel was bright in colored
gleams, as if with a mild glory of sweetness, of
repose and innocence. There was, moreover,
great silence in the chamber. The sorrow of
that day equalled former gladness. What delight
and prattling when Potkanski, returning
in the evening tired with toil, embraced his
wife with one arm, and putting back her golden
hair, kissed her forehead, which at that time
was calm and serene. How much quiet, deep
joy when they stood in silence breast to breast
and eye to eye, like statues of Love! Afterward
they ran to the cradle where the little
one, twittering with itself in various ways, and
raising its tiny feet, laughed at the happy
parents.</p>

<p>Now the cradle was empty. Marvellously
affecting was that cradle. It seemed that the
child was there.</p>

<p>More than once, in the first period of her
misfortune, the widow, when she woke in the
night, put her hand carefully into the cradle
with the conviction that God must have pitied
her, and, removing the child from the coffin,
placed it back in the cradle.</p>

<p>In a word, those walls had seen much joy,
lulled by the happiness of serene love, then
tears as large as pearls, then despair, which was
silent, deathlike, and finally stubborn, mad.</p>

<p>Such was the sleeping-room of that widow,
and such were the thoughts which were roused
at sight of the apartment. The little drawing-room,
like all of its kind, had a sort of slight
elegance and much emptiness. In that chamber,
too, the echoes of past moments seemed
to wander. It was well lighted, clean, but
common; the room of the servant adjoined
it,&mdash;a small dark closet with an entrance on
the stairway and a wooden partition.</p>

<p>Such was the former residence of Potkanski.
After his death it was difficult to understand
whence the means came to keep up such lodgings;
this, however, pertained to Gustav, he
knew what he was doing. There were no
claims on the part of the owner; how this was
managed we shall explain somewhat later.</p>

<p>As often as Gustav entered that dwelling he
trembled.</p>

<p>In a place which was full of her presence,
where everything that was not she was for
her, he felt always a kind of weight on his
breast, as if some hand were pressing his
heart down more deeply. But that pressure
was for him delightful. It was a contraction
of his breast as if to inhale more air. To be
pressed down by a feeling of happiness is
almost to be happy, except that beyond it
lies an immense shoreless space of desires. It
inundates the whole man then, enters into his
blood, manifests itself in the trembling of his
words, in the glitter of his eyes. That desire
itself does not know what it wants. Between
too little and too much there is no boundary
in the present case. This is the bashful desire
of everything. A man is more daring
externally than internally; his own words
frighten him; it seems to him that some one
else is saying something, he guards his own
glances, he wants to laugh spasmodically or
to burst out sobbing. He loves, he honors,
he makes an angel of a woman, and then
desires that same angel as a woman.</p>

<p>Gustav experienced this when he entered
the widow's apartments. Every kind of desire
which spirit and blood joined together
can summon, flew to him from all sides, like
flocks of winged creatures.</p>

<p>She stood before him. She was pale; on
her lips appeared a slight trace of ruddiness.
Her delicate profile was outlined on the background
of the window like a silhouette. She
held a comb in her hand, and, standing before
the small silver-framed mirror, was combing
her hair. Luxuriant tresses wound like waves
around her pale forehead. That golden mass
flowed down over her shoulders and breast,
and seemed to drop like amber.</p>

<p>Seeing Gustav, she greeted him with her
hand and with a barely perceptible smile.</p>

<p>The widow had emerged from her former
lethargy. That sudden and violent shock which
the sight of Yosef at the restaurant had called
forth roused her, enlivened her. She began to
think. One thing alone was she unable at first
to explain. Yosef's form was so confounded
in her mind with that of Potkanski that she
did not know herself which was her former
husband. That was the remnant of her insanity.
But soon a ray of light returned to
that beclouded mind. She begged Gustav to
let her see Yosef. Gustav, though unwilling,
agreed to this. With yearning did she wait
for the evening when she was to look at that
reminder of her former happiness. Not Yosef
was she seeking, but the reminder; hence he
was for her an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>Then gradually and quite imperceptibly the
past changed into the present, the dream into
a reality. Yosef, noting this, had promised
Gustav not to visit her; to prepare Helena
and announce this news to her pertained to
Gustav.</p>

<p>It was easy to foresee the impression which
this would make. She clasped her hands and
threw back her head. A torrent of hair covered
her shoulders with a rustle.</p>

<p>"Where shall I see him?" asked she, insistently.</p>

<p>Gustav was silent.</p>

<p>"I must see him here or elsewhere. He is
so like Kazimir&mdash;My God, I live entirely
by that memory, Pan Gustav."</p>

<p>Gustav was silent. He was made almost
indignant by that blind egotism of Pani Helena.
The drama began to play in him again. She
begged him to do everything to undermine his
own happiness. No! to act thus he would
have to be a fool. But on the other hand&mdash;it
was Helena who made the prayer. He bit
his lips till the blood came, and was silent.
Moreover, something belongs to him even from
life. Everything that in him made up the man
opposed her prayers with desperate energy.
Meanwhile she continued to urge,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pan Gustav, you will arrange so that I
shall see him? I wish to see him. Why do
you do me such an injustice?"</p>

<p>Cold sweat covered Gustav's forehead; he
stretched his hands to his face, and in a gloomy
voice answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do you no injustice, but"&mdash;here his voice
quivered, he made an effort not to fall at
her feet and cry out, "But I love thee, do
not torture me!"&mdash;"he does not wish to
come here," concluded he, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>He would have given much to avoid this
moment. Helena covered her face with her
hands and dropped into the armchair. Silence
continued for a while, and the rustling of leaves
was heard outside the window; inside the
soul of a man was writhing in a conflict with
itself. To bring Yosef, to take Helena from
him, was for Gustav to unbridle misfortune.</p>

<p>The struggle was brief; he knelt before
Helena, and putting his lips to her hand, said
in a broken voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall do what I can. He will come here.
What am I to any one? He will come, but I
cannot tell when&mdash;I will bring him myself."</p>

<p>Soon after, in leaving the widow's lodgings,
he muttered through his set teeth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, he will come; but it is not I who will
bring him&mdash;he will come in a month&mdash;in two
months&mdash;perhaps I shall be at rest."</p>

<p>An attack of coughing interrupted further
meditation. Gustav wandered through the
streets for a long time; when he returned
home, it struck two in the church belfry.</p>

<p>Yosef was sleeping; he was breathing uniformly,
quietly; the light of the lamp fell on
his high forehead and open breast. Gustav
looked feverishly at that breast. His eyes
gleamed with hatred. He sat thus about an
hour. All at once he trembled, he came to
himself. A sensation was roused in him entirely
opposite to any which he had felt up to
that moment, a sensation of hunger; he went
to the book-shelves, and taking a piece of
brown bread, fell to eating it hastily.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Autumn</span> was approaching. It was cold in the
rooms of the poorer students. Wrapped in
their blankets and wearing caps, they warmed
themselves with study. The rooms of those
who had something with which to heat their
stoves were swarming with comrades. No one
visited the club any longer. At first there
were efforts to select some other place for a
club, but it ended in nothing, because Gustav
on the one hand, and on the other Yosef, who
had acquired considerable influence among
students, resisted together; more especially
Yosef, who held that clubs consumed too much
time and were of small utility. He desired
to introduce reform in this regard, and at
last he succeeded. In spite of all opposing
opinions he combated for that idea in the
University, and especially at Vasilkevich's
rooms, where students met with more willingness
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich roomed with Karvovski, or
rather the latter with Vasilkevich, for though
Karvovski was very wealthy (he was that pale
youth who had played on the piano to his
comrades in the club) and paid by far the
greater part of the rent for their lodgings, the
soul and the pivot of this male housekeeping
was our Lithuanian.</p>

<p>The friendship between these two young
men deserved admiration and even envy. One,
delicate, pampered, beautiful, with a head full
of the loftiest dreams, mild-mannered and beloved
of all, slipped lightly through life in
comfort and plenty. The other, a genuine
Lithuanian; ugly in appearance, pock-marked,
with closely cut hair and flashing eyes, vivacious,
laborious, energetic, and profoundly instructed,
was for the first as a guardian or
elder brother.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich possessed a warm heart, and
was made, as the phrase runs, for the palm of
the hand. Once when Karvovski fell dangerously
ill, he nursed him night and day with
real unparalleled self-denial, and when at last
he recovered, the Lithuanian wept and scolded
him from delight. "Oh, thou jester," said he,
"what a trick for thee to fall ill; but just try
it a second time!"</p>

<p>The students called them a chosen pair, and
an old blind grandfather (minstrel) of the
Ukraine who begged not far from their lodgings
and to whom they gave frequent alms, spoke
of them as the "kind-hearted young lords."</p>

<p>Many circumstances united them, but especially
one which we shall mention immediately.
They spent a summer vacation in
the country at Karvovski's. Karvovski had
a sister, weakly and not comely, but with
wonderful kindness of heart, quiet, calm, a
genuine angel, with a sunburnt little face and
a fragile figure. That young maiden was loved
by Vasilkevich; he loved her in his own way,
very deeply, with faith in her and in his love,
and, what is more, she loved him. Her parents
did not know much of the matter, or if they
did know they had no wish to hinder the
young people. The maiden was ill-favored, he
was honest and reliable; these facts balanced
the small inequality of social position. Moreover,
they did not wish to deprive their son of
a society which in every regard could be
only of use to him.</p>

<p>This Lithuanian had another good side; he
loved his parents beyond everything,&mdash;the
"old people," as he called them. These old people
lived in remotest Jmud, near Livonia; they
were poor, their son helped them. His father
was a forester. The old man had a small home
in the wilderness; round about him the forest
sounded and the wave plashed; beyond the
forest and the wave were other forests and
other waves,&mdash;a remote corner it was behind
the lakes. The devil lived there, according
to local traditions, but somehow that devil did
not trouble the old people. Such was the place
in which Vasilkevich first saw the light of day.</p>

<p>When as a boy he went fishing, he met
ducks beyond the lake, he found nests in the
swamps. He was of a healthy and active disposition.
Nature had cradled him; he was
taught by birds, water, and trees. From the
fern of the forest to the birch which knew not
where in the heavens to put its head, all was
for him a book the first words of which he
himself learned to read. The birds of the
Commonwealth explained their laws to him;
once he saw how beavers made dams with
their tails in the rivers; he knew that by following
the voice of the bee-eater he could find
hidden bee-nests; he knew how to take their
young from the badgers. He even brought
home young wolves to the house with him.</p>

<p>When he had grown up sufficiently, his
father taught him to read; the old man drew
out of a box some rusty coins, and sent the
boy to school; then difficult times set in.
There was need to learn; so he learned. It
would be a long tale to tell how much and
what he passed through before he reached the
University and began to be the man whom
we know at present.</p>

<p>His parents returned his love a hundred-fold.
In truth, they were a pair of doves whitened
by age, loving each other, in agreement and
happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness and peace dwelt in that cottage.
Such bright spots on the earth are met with,
though rarely, like oases in a desert. The old
people enjoyed each other, and went side by
side as in the first days after marriage; they
called each other falcon and berry. What joy
there was when that son came home for vacation,
no tongue can tell, no pen can describe.
With Vasilkevich came Karvovski. The old
people loved and petted him also, but he was
not for them as their Yasek, whom they simply
called "Ours."</p>

<p>Often when the young men were tired from
racing a whole day through the wilderness,
the old people after going to bed talked
in a low voice about them. This is what
Karvovski heard once through their chamber
partition,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is a handsome boy, that Karvovski,"
said the old man.</p>

<p>"But ours is handsomer," answered the old
woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, handsomer, handsomer!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile that "Ours" was what is called
ugly, but through the prism of parental love
he seemed the most beautiful on earth. It
is not reality itself, but the heart with which
we approach it that gives things their form
and color.</p>

<p>But let us return to Kieff and to our acquaintances.</p>

<p>It is nothing wonderful that with such hosts
as Vasilkevich and Karvovski their dwelling,
in which among other things stood a perfect
stove, became a centre for many students.
Even the intelligence of the University assembled
there; literary evenings were established.
All who felt a vein for letters made
public their productions in those rooms.
The long autumn evenings were turned into
genuine literary sessions. It would be difficult
to enumerate the burning thoughts which
were uttered there by youthful lips.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich, Karvovski, Yosef, in a little
while Gustav, and especially Augustinovich,
took the lead in those meetings. Yosef tried
his creative powers, but somehow he did not
succeed, he had not the talent, simply; he did
not know how to fashion, how to create, how to
attach his own ideas to that golden thread of
fantasy which bathes all things in rainbow
tints before it gives them to the world warmed
and illuminated, or bright as a summer night's
lightning.</p>

<p>But in recompense he had another kind of
power. He judged soundly, and what is more,
with keenness. After he had read a production
of his own he analyzed it in presence of
all; joyous laughter continued till late in the
apartments. In like manner did he treat the
productions of others; if he ridiculed the
chips flew from those first offerings placed on
the altar of art. He was able so to arrange
his voice and expression of face to the current
of his words that when he wished the
gloomiest subject roused the most laughter.
This obtained for him great consideration.
Those who, feeling a sympathy for the moon,
struck the sentimental chords of their hearts,
dreaded him as they might have dreaded Satan.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich described his Lithuanian lakes
and forests pithily. From time to time Karvovski
permitted himself lyric verses in which dew,
tears, lilies of the valley, and sighs spoke with
each other in the manner of people. In this
case it was not a question of judgment, but of
the love of a village shepherd for a birch of
the field which after his death "took up and
withered," according to the words of those
pathetic verses.</p>

<p>There were better and worse things in that
assembly; humor appeared often, but at times
something superior which was worth listening
to, especially since by degrees through exercise
and criticism capacities of greater or less power
were manifested.</p>

<p>But Augustinovich towered above every one
at all times. It happened more than once, God
forgive, that he came drunk to the meeting, his
manuscript crushed, soiled, and written fragmentarily
on anything; but when he began to
read all else was forgotten, the soul clung to his
words. More than one student used hands
and head, drew out of himself all that was best,
wrote a thing that was more or less good, but
common. "That lurking soul" caught up
a pen right there in the room amid noise and
conversation, but sheets and sheets flew from
his hand and dropped under the table. When
he had finished writing he picked up the
sheets, arranged them, and sat down with
indifference; but all listened, and more than
one man envied him secretly. His figures
were as if living, so complete were they; under
the wave of his words thought flowed in a
hundred colors, like a serpent glittering with
jewels. When he spoke of love you felt the
beating of a beloved heart on your own; when
he rose with the strength of enthusiasm, the
thunder of words roared, and the mind dazzled
by lightning flashes quivered in fear; when
in the low fall of words he depicted some feeling
touchingly, the odor of roses and myrtle
was discovered in the air, the fern blossomed
in the moonlight, from some place beyond the
forest and the pine wood, the song of a maiden
floated out on the dew.</p>

<p>Ah, he was gifted! Beautiful words and
beautiful thoughts fell from him of themselves,
not having apparent connection with the man.
Those were blossoms on a quagmire. Revelations
of humor, in which moral fall accompanied
cynicism, testified best of all to this.</p>

<p>"Ei, Augustinovich! Augustinovich!" said
the students to him then, "with thy gifts, were
there not such a devil in thee, what couldst
thou not do, O thou scapegrace!"</p>

<p>"For this very reason I wish to drown him.
Have ye not something here to drink?" replied
he.</p>

<p>Gustav had been present at those meetings
a few times; but he did not like Karvovski,
simply because all liked him. The more difficult
his career was, the more clouds obscured
the horizon of his love, the more irritable and
embittered did he become. Passionate and
unsuccessful attachments have this peculiarity,
that they develop hatreds just as passionate.
Such a hatred not directed to any person or
thing yet had occupied Gustav's breast and was
resting like rust in it. He hated all who had
what he lacked. He felt as if wronged, and
for every wrong such natures are accustomed
to pay, even though they pay only in theory.</p>

<p>He withdrew, therefore, from the society of
students, though among them alone existed
hearts which could beat for him. He knew
this, and in spite of his hatred for all men he
loved students; still he shut himself up within
his own bosom. Sympathy humiliated him.
He suspected the existence of pity in all
places, and was afraid of it.</p>

<p>Finally, they learned this, that Yosef had
promised him not to visit Helena. This information
had not come from Yosef, but from
Gustav himself; he had told it in a moment of
irritation. Naturally this raised Yosef in the
opinion of his comrades. Gustav was angry.
Between him and Yosef a dark cloud of dislike
had intervened.</p>

<p>The widow spoke to him of Yosef with
greater and greater insistence, with increasing
force, with rising passion. A process of ill-omen
for Gustav, as Gustav himself thought,
took place in her. The deceased Potkanski
became more and more incarnate in Yosef; in
this new figure Potkanski was dissolved and
lost. By degrees, and just through long separation,
the enthusiastic heart of Helena remembered
Yosef more and more, but now for the
sake of himself.</p>

<p>A new epoch of resuscitated happiness for
the widow, of dying hope for Gustav, emerged
gradually, urged on by the rude hand of necessity,&mdash;an
epoch born of tears, chance, and
pain.</p>

<p>"I may not, I may not be long in peace!"
thought he. "But happen what may, I will
not bring him here a second time."</p>

<p>Every one will divine easily what was hidden
under a reflection of that sort. Gustav judged
that he would be able to stifle himself by work,&mdash;he
was more and more wearied; happy
moments he had only in sleep.</p>

<p>Once he dreamed that he was at Helena's
knees and kissing her hands; he felt distinctly
her dear palms on his heart. Then in the
dream excitement of passion he found her lips
with his lips, and almost suffered from excess
of delight.</p>

<p>After that came awakening.</p>

<p>He saw her daily,&mdash;he was so near to her
and always so distant.</p>

<p>He grew thinner and more emaciated; in his
eyes shone feverish gleams of unbending will.
That fever exhausted him, but kept him on his
feet.</p>

<p>"I am curious to know what will come of
this," muttered he through his parched lips.</p>

<p>But there was one side almost sublime in
this gloomy exertion of suffering. Gustav was
not dreaming. He took life as it was, not as
it might be. In spite of the sad condition of
his health, he knew how to work, and worked
more than ever. To come from Pani Helena
and sit down to toil needed no common
strength,&mdash;such victories he won over his own
nature daily. He gathered about him a number
of the most capable men, and as it were to
compare them with the assemblies at Vasilkevich's,
he organized a circle laboring only scientifically.
He and two fellow-students were
writing a grammar of the Lettish languages;
in spite of continual disputes with his co-workers,
he stood at the head of this labor,
and what he stole from suffering he gave to it.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> could be more irritating than the
relations of these students.</p>

<p>They lived together.</p>

<p>At last Gustav on returning one day from
Pani Helena's found Yosef's effects packed.
Yosef himself was occupied in arranging his
books and linen.</p>

<p>Both were silent till all was ready; then
Yosef said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gustav, farewell! I am moving out."</p>

<p>Gustav reached him his hand without saying
a word. They parted coldly.</p>

<p>On the road Vasilkevich met Yosef.</p>

<p>"Ho! What is this?" inquired he. "Art
thou moving?"</p>

<p>"Thou knowest my relations with Gustav,
judge thyself if I can live with him longer."</p>

<p>"But this is clear, it was not well for
thee to leave him in his present condition of
health."</p>

<p>"I understand, but I assure thee that I can
only irritate him. Thou knowest what I have
done for Gustav; he has no real reason to
dislike me; but still&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vasilkevich pressed his hand.</p>

<p>Yosef's new lodgings were in a house of
several stories. They consisted of two large
and good-looking rooms. Besides the money
which he had brought from home, Yosef immediately
after his arrival found means which
permitted him to save his capital to the utmost.
He began to think then of a more
comfortable mode of life, and at last arranged
things far better really than at the beginning.
From the first glance one might note ease and
plenty in the new dwelling. The bed was made
in good order every day, the floor swept, and
in the small porcelain stove a cheerful fire
burned daily, toward evening&mdash;it was so comfortable
there that the soul rejoiced!</p>

<p>For that matter, the whole house was far
better arranged than the other, it was even
elegant. On the first story lived some general
with his wife and two daughters, as ugly as two
winter nights; on the second story lived Yosef,
and a French engineer from whom the rooms
were hired; and on the third some reduced
count, a man immensely rich on a time, perhaps,
but at that moment bankrupt; he lived
in three or four rooms with his grown-up
daughter and two or three servant-maids from
the Ukraine. Such were Yosef's neighbors.</p>

<p>Soon they gave evidence of themselves, for
all day in the engineer's rooms groaned a
piano at which children were learning to play
all the contra-dances ever danced up to that
time in any land; at the general's were continual
amusements, dances, and evening parties.
Whole nights through there was stamping
there, as in a mill, servants moving about on
the stairway; there was no lack of noise and
rattle.</p>

<p>The count alone lived quietly. There is
nothing wonderful in this, that he and his
daughter sat there meditating sadly over their
own ruin like Jews over the ruins of Jerusalem.
Yosef of course did not know them yet, but
at times about dusk, by the clatter on the
stairs and the heavy tread, he divined that the
old count was taking his daughter to walk;
but not being fond of titles or coronets, he had
in truth no curiosity to look at them.</p>

<p>Once, however, he saw something which interested
him more. A certain day, while going
to his room, he saw between the first story and
the second a certain bust bent over the banisters
with a head altogether shapely, blue eyes,
and dark hair. Those eyes, shaded by a hand,
were looking carefully for something in the
half light of the passage. Seeing Yosef, the
head pushed forward, and with it the body,
and when the student hurried on, wishing to
see the young lady more nearly, he saw only
two small feet in black boots and white stockings.
The feet were fleeing upstairs with all
speed.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is the countess then!" thought
he.</p>

<p>The countess roused his curiosity. He did
not know himself why in the dusk sitting in
front of the fire he saw definitely before him
that pair of eyes covered with the hand, the
white forehead surrounded with curls of dark
hair, and the feet in black boots.</p>

<p>A couple of evenings later when at an advanced
hour he had put out the light and lain
down in bed, he heard some voice singing
a melancholy song in Italian. The passage
and Yosef's room also were filled with those
tones, youthful, resonant, sympathetic; the
fond and passionate adjurations and reproaches
were given out with a marvellous charm; in
the stillness of night the words came forth
clearly.</p>

<p>"Ah! the countess is singing!" murmured
Yosef.</p>

<p>Next morning early, he knew not why, while
dressing and rubbing his hands with soap stubbornly,
he sang with much pathos as if to lend
himself energy.</p>

<p>But soon he ceased; the widow came to his
mind instead of the countess. "That woman
either loves me already, or she would love me
very soon," thought he. He wished the return
of those moments during which he had looked
into her eyes. "What a strange woman!"
thought he. "How that Potkanski must have
loved her&mdash;ha! and Gustav!" He frowned.
"If I go there, will he not grieve to death, will
he not poison himself? That love will ruin
him&mdash;h'm! Each answers for himself. But I
am curious to know what she says since I do
not visit her."</p>

<p>Thenceforth that moment recurred to his
mind frequently when she, so pale and with
outstretched arms, exclaimed, "I have found
thee, my Kazimir!"</p>

<p>If only he wished, he could go to her, love
her, and be loved by her.</p>

<p>This plan of probable love did not let him
sleep. Like every young man, he felt the need
of love; his heart beat violently, as if it wanted
to burst, broken by its own strength. And so
far he knew no woman except the widow. The
black boots and white stockings of the countess
passed before his eyes, but that slight
imagining vanished into nothingness.</p>

<p>He remembered meanwhile how on a certain
time during conversation he had held the
widow's hand; he remembered what a wish he
had had to kiss it, but he remembered also how
ominously Gustav's eyes were glittering at that
moment. Jealousy seized him. Occasionally a
scarcely visible cloud, regret for a premature
promise, sped past in his soul and hid somewhere
in its darkest caves. Then he repeated
in a very tragic tone, "I have promised, I will
not go."</p>

<p>One thing more angered him,&mdash;to people
respected and more advanced in life this would
seem a paradox,&mdash;the quiet of life angered him.
Science came to him easily, he did not expend
all his powers, and this roused distaste in him.
Fresh, active natures, like young soldiers, feel
a need of bathing in the fire of battle. This
desire of his to fight which at a more advanced
age seems to us improbable, becomes in certain
years, and quite seriously, one of the needs of
the spirit. Let us remember Yosef's monologue
in Gustav's room, the first day of his coming
to Kieff. He wanted then to throw down
the gauntlet in the name of science or the
name of feeling, before the whole world.
Young eagles try to fly with a cloud above
them and an abyss underneath. Even the
most common man, before learning that he is
a turtle, has moments in which he thinks himself
an eagle.</p>

<p>In such a condition was Yosef, and in this
case there was simply no one with whom to be
at sword's-points.</p>

<p>In the University he had a greater or less
number of adherents, a field in the wide world
might open, but Yosef did not know this wide
world yet.</p>

<p>Suddenly something happened which snatched
him from his lethargy.</p>

<p>Augustinovich had acted in a way that
offended the honor of students. They determined
to expel him.</p>

<p>That was not his first offence, but the
students had always passed those matters over
among themselves, not wishing to be compromised
in public opinion; now the measure
had been exceeded. We will not acquaint the
reader with the offence; what concern have we
with foulness? It is enough that a court composed
of students had decided to expel the
offender. From such decisions there was no
appeal, for the University authorities always
confirmed them; an appeal would only make
it more widely known.</p>

<p>Indignation among students was great; no
one took the part of Augustinovich except
Yosef, who rousing half the University exerted
his power to save the man.</p>

<p>"You wish to expel him," said he, at a very
stormy meeting. "You wish to expel him?
But do you think that after he has left the University
he will not bring shame to you? What
will he do with himself? Where will he go?
How will he find means of living? How will
he maintain himself? And do you know why
he fell? No!&mdash;Ask him when he has eaten
a dinner. We are among ourselves. Raise
either of his feet, the right or the left, all the
same! If under his boots you find one sound
sole, expel him. As to me I declare, and may
the thunderbolts split any one who will say
otherwise, that we ought to save, not to ruin
him. Give him salvation, give him bread&mdash;take
him on your own responsibility!"</p>

<p>"Who will answer for him?" asked one of
Augustinovich's opponents.</p>

<p>"I!" shouted Yosef in a thundering voice;
and he threw his cap on the floor.</p>

<p>There was uproar and confusion in the
room. Vasilkevich supported Yosef with all
his influence, others insisted on his expulsion,
there was no "small uproar." Yosef sprang
onto a bench, and turning to Augustinovich
shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They forgive thee! Come with me."</p>

<p>He left the room, rubbing his hands with
internal delight, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would be a pity to lose such a head!
Besides, let them eat the devil if they act without
me now!"</p>

<p>"Why didst thou save me?" inquired
Augustinovich.</p>

<p>Yosef turned a severe face toward him and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day thou wilt move into my lodgings."</p>

<p>Meanwhile another drama was played in
Pani Helena's lodgings. She was a most peculiar
person; she could not exist, she knew
not how to exist, without attaching her life
to some feeling. Her first chance had been
fortunate; she proved a model wife and mother.
It had seemed to her that she found salvation
in Yosef, and now months had passed since
she had seen him; and she desired him the
more, the more persistently Gustav resisted.</p>

<p>The last struggle of these directly opposing
forces had to come.</p>

<p>"If thou wilt not return him to me," said
the widow in tears, one evening, "I will go
myself to find him. I am ready to kneel down
before thee and beg on my knees for him,
Gustav! Thou sayest that Kazimir begged
thee to have care over me; so I implore thee
in his name. O God, O God! Thou dost
not understand that it is possible to suffer;
thou hast never loved, of course."</p>

<p>"I, Pani! have never loved?" repeated
Gustav, in a very low voice; and in his eyes
real pain was evident. "Perhaps thou art
speaking the truth. Then thou hast observed
nothing, hast seen nothing? I know not myself
that I have loved any one except&mdash;O God,
what do I utter!&mdash;except thee alone."</p>

<p>He threw himself at Helena's feet.</p>

<p>Great silence followed. One might have
said that the two persons had become stone,&mdash;she
bent backward, with her hands over her
face, he at her feet. They continued in this
posture, both oblivious of everything around
them. But a moment comes when the greatest
pain is conquered.</p>

<p>He rose soon, a new man; he was very calm.
He roused her, and spoke in a low voice, interrupted
through a lack of breath.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Helena! I should not have
done this, but thou seest I have been suffering
so long. This is the third year since I saw thee
the first time&mdash;I saw thee in a church; the
priest was just elevating the chalice, and thou
wert inclining&mdash;I visited that church afterward,
I saw thee more frequently, and, pardon
me! I myself cannot tell how it happened.
Afterward thou didst become his wife&mdash;I said
nothing. And this time I did not wish to
offend or annoy thee, but thou sayest that
I have never loved. Thou seest that that
is not true. How hard it is to renounce the
last hope! Pardon me! Pan Yosef will come
to-day to thee&mdash;he is a man of noble nature,
love him, be happy&mdash;and farewell."</p>

<p>He bent toward her, and raising the hem of
her garment, with gleaming upturned eyes, he
kissed the cloth as though it were sacred.</p>

<p>After a while the widow was alone.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" whispered she, in a
low voice. "What did Gustav say? He said,
I remember it, that <em>he</em> would come again to
me. Am I dreaming? But no, <em>he</em> will come."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Augustinovich went to live permanently
with Yosef. How different was his
former from his present life! Formerly he had
had no warm corner, now Yosef gave him a
warm corner; he had had no bed, Yosef
bought him a bed; he had had no blanket,
Yosef bought him a blanket; he had had no
clothes, Yosef got clothes for him; he had
been without food, Yosef divided his own dinner
with him. He found himself in conditions
entirely different. Warmed, nourished, in a
decent overcoat, combed, washed, shaved, he
became a different man altogether. He was, as
we have said, a person with a character unparalleled
for weakness; conditions of life always
created him, he was merely the resultant of
forces. So under Yosef's strong hand he
changed beyond recognition. He began to enjoy
order and plenty, abundance in life. As he
had not been ashamed before of anything, so
now he began to be ashamed of everything
which did not accord with elegant clothing and
gloves. The most difficult thing was to disaccustom
himself from drinking; but he had no
chance to resume his former vice, for Yosef,
who guarded him as the eye in his head, did
not let him out of sight; he bought vodka for
him, but did not let him have money. It would
be difficult to describe the impatience with
which Augustinovich waited for the moment
when Yosef opened the cupboard to pour him
a glass. How much he dreamed in that moment,
how he represented the taste of the drink
to himself, the putting of it to his lips, the
touch of it on his tongue, the swallowing
through his throat, and finally the solemn entrance
of it into his stomach!</p>

<p>But Yosef, to deprive this treat of its humiliating
character, drank to him usually.</p>

<p>In the course of time he treated him better;
he began to associate him with various affairs
of his own and the University, and finally
with his own way of thinking. There is no
need of saying that Augustinovich took all
this to himself, that he repeated Yosef's words
where he could preface them usually with, "I
judge that, etc." Who would have recognized
him? He, for whom nothing had been too
cynical, said now in student gatherings when
the conversation took too free a turn, "Gentlemen,
above all, decency." The students
laughed; Yosef himself smiled in silence, but
so far he was content with his own work.</p>

<p>We need not add that Yosef attending the
same faculty with Augustinovich studied with
him evenings. He had then the opportunity
of estimating his capabilities to the full. For
that mind there was no such thing as more
difficult or easier; a certain wild intuition took
the place of thought and deliberation. His
memory, not so retentive as it was capacious,
took the place of labor.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich was a frequent visitor of theirs.
At first he came with Karvovski, then he came
alone daily at his own hour. His conversations
with Yosef, circling about the most important
questions of life and science, became
more confidential. Those two men felt each
other, and each divined in the other a powerful
mind and will. A relation founded on
mutual esteem seemed to herald a permanent
future.</p>

<p>Both seized in their hands the direction of
youth in the University; the initiative of general
activities started only with them, and since
they agreed there was agreement in the University;
comradeship and science gained most
by that friendship.</p>

<p>"Tell me," inquired Yosef on a time, "what
do they say of my action with Augustinovich?"</p>

<p>"Some pay thee homage," answered Vasilkevich;
"others laugh. I visited one of thy opponents
on behalf of our library; I found there
no small crowd, and they were just speaking
of thee and Augustinovich. But dost thou
know who defended thee most warmly?"</p>

<p>"Well, who was it?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"Lolo Karvovski."</p>

<p>"No, not he."</p>

<p>"As God lives, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"Gustav."</p>

<p>"Gustav?"</p>

<p>"Ah, he told those who were laughing at
thee so many agreeable facts&mdash;they will not
forget them soon, I guarantee that. Thou
knowest how well he can do such things. I
thought that the deuce would take them."</p>

<p>"I should not have expected this of Gustav."</p>

<p>"I had not seen him for a long time. Oh,
he has sunk in that wretched love to the ears.
But he is a strong fellow&mdash;and I am sorry for
him. Tell me, thou art more skilled in this
than I am: is he very sick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is not well."</p>

<p>"What is it? asthma?"</p>

<p>Yosef nodded. "Excessive work, grief."</p>

<p>"Too bad."</p>

<p>All at once steps were heard on the stairs,
the door opened, Gustav walked in.</p>

<p>He was changed beyond recognition. The
skin on his face had become wonderfully white,
it had grown transparent. From his face came
a certain coldness, as from a corpse; a yellowish
shade shone from his forehead, which
seemed to be of wax. His lips were white; his
hair, beard, and mustache looked almost black
as compared with that pallor. He was like a
man who had passed through a long illness,
and on his face had settled certainty concerning
himself and a kind of despairing
resignation.</p>

<p>Yosef, a little astonished, a little confused,
did not know perhaps how to begin. Gustav
brought him out of the trouble.</p>

<p>"I have come to thee with a prayer," said
he. "Once thou didst promise not to visit
the widow; withdraw that promise."</p>

<p>Yosef made a wry face with a kind of constraint.
But he only answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not a custom with me to break my
word."</p>

<p>"True," answered Gustav, calmly; "but this
is something entirely different. If I were to
die, for example, the promise would not bind
thee, and I, as thou seest, am sick, very grievously
sick. Meanwhile she needs protection.
I cannot protect her now, I cannot watch
over her. I must lie down to rest, for I am
wearied somewhat. For that matter, I will tell
the whole truth to thee. She loves thee, and
beyond doubt thou lovest her also. I have
stood in thy way and hers, but now I withdraw.
I do so perforce, and I shall not represent
this as a sacrifice. I loved her much, and
I had a little hope that she would love me
some day; but I was mistaken." Here his voice
fell an octave lower. "No one has ever loved
me. It has been very gloomy for me in life&mdash;But
what is to be done? Of late I have passed
through much, but now that is over. To-day
my concern is that she be not left alone. Had
I been able to decide on a sacrifice, thou
wouldst be her protector to-day. Canst thou
do this for me, Yosef? Thou hast energy,
thou art rich, and she, I say, loves thee, so
thou wilt not end as I have. Oh, it has been
hard in this world for me&mdash;But never mind.
I should not like to do her an injury&mdash;I love
her yet. I should not wish her to be alone
because of me. At times, seest thou, it is not
proper to refuse people anything. Go, go to
her! Thou and I lived together once, we
fought the same trouble, hence thou shouldst
do me this favor; for, I repeat, I am sick
and I know not whether I shall see her or thee
again."</p>

<p>A tear gathered in Vasilkevich's eye; he rose
and said, turning to Yosef,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou shouldst do all that Gustav asks of
thee."</p>

<p>"I will go to her, I will protect her," answered
Yosef, decidedly. "I give my word of
honor to both of you."</p>

<p>"I thank thee," said Gustav. "Go there
now."</p>

<p>A little later he was alone with Vasilkevich.
The Lithuanian was silent for some time, he
struggled with his own heart; finally he spoke
in a voice of heartfelt sympathy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gustav, poor Gustav, how thou must suffer
at this moment!"</p>

<p>Gustav made no answer. He drew the air
into his mouth with hissing, gritted his teeth,
his face quivered convulsively, and a sudden
sobbing tore his breast, strength left him
completely.</p>

<hr class="hr45"/>

<p>Three days later Yosef and Vasilkevich were
sitting in Gustav's lodging. The evening was
bright; bundles of moonlight were falling into
the room through the panes. At the bedside
of the sick man a candle was burning. The
sick man himself was still conscious. Almost
beautiful was his face, which had grown yellow
from suffering, with its lofty forehead, as it
rested on high pillows. One emaciated hand
lay on the blanket, with the other he pressed
his bosom.</p>

<p>The light of the candle cast a rosy gleam on
that martyr to his own feelings. The opposite
corner of the room was obscure in the shadow.
Gustav was giving an account of how he had
cared for Helena. From time to time he
answered, though with difficulty, now to Yosef,
now to Vasilkevich, who, standing at the head
of the bed, wiped away the abundant perspiration
which came out on the forehead of the
sufferer.</p>

<p>"I wish to forewarn thee," said Gustav.
"They send her two thousand zlotys yearly
(about $250), but she needs from five to six
thousand. I earned the rest for her&mdash;Push
away the candle, and moisten my lips&mdash;I took
from my own mouth, I did not sleep enough&mdash;Sometimes
I did not eat a meal for two days&mdash;Raise
me a little, and support me higher, I
cannot speak&mdash;There are thirty rubles more
for her in that box&mdash;It is dark around me&mdash;Let
me rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>A mouse made a piece of paper rustle in
one corner; except that, silence held the room.
Death was coming.</p>

<p>"I should like to finish our work," continued
Gustav. "Tell my associates not to quarrel&mdash;Cold
is seizing me&mdash;I am curious to know if
there be a heaven or a hell. I have never
prayed&mdash;but, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vasilkevich inclined toward him and asked
in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gustav, dost thou believe in immortality?"</p>

<p>The sick man could speak no longer; he
nodded in sign of affirmation. Then low tones
of enchanting music seemed to be given forth
in that chamber. Along the rays of the moonlight
a legion of angels pushed in from the
sky; the room was filled with them, some with
white, others with golden or colored wings.
They came quietly, bent over the bed. The
rustle of their wings was audible.</p>

<p>The spirit of Gustav went away with that
low-sounding orchestra.</p>

<p>The funeral took place with great solemnity.
The whole University in a body was present
around the coffin. Then they spoke for the
first time of the accurate knowledge, the toil
and sacrifices of the deceased. It appeared
from the accounts which Yosef examined that
Gustav had earned about four thousand zlotys
($500) yearly. All of this went to the
widow; he lived himself like a dog. This
voluntary but silent heroism made for him an
enduring monument in the hearts of the young
men. They discovered also various labors of
the deceased which indicated solid acquirements,
nay, talent. They found his diary,
which was a confession in simple and even
blunt words of all the dark side of his life of
privation, a kind of apology for the passionate
outbreaks of youth, those imaginary but still
real sufferings, those struggles, those pains,
those internal storms, and conversations held
with self. The inner life of enthusiastic natures
was unveiled there in all its dark solemnity. It
was a terror to look into that chaos which is not
to be known in every-day life, in that "so devilishly
gilded world," as the poetess calls it.</p>

<p>The memoirs were read at Vasilkevich's
rooms; there was even a proposition to print
them, though it was not brought into effect
somehow. But Augustinovich wrote a paper
after Gustav's death. Very eloquently did he
describe the man's career. He showed him
from years of childhood, when he was still
happy. The charm of the description of those
spring moments of life was so great that it
seemed as though the sun of May had shone
upon the writer. Then the picture grew
sombre. It was seen how the deceased had
left his native cottage; how the dog, the old
servant, ran after him howling. Then still
darker: life hurled him about, tossed him, rent
him. Again a ray shone as if on a cloud. In
rainbow form Pani Helena appeared to him&mdash;he
stretched his arms toward that light. "The
rest you know," wrote Augustinovich. "Let
him sleep now, and dream of her. The field
swallow will sing her name above his grave.
Let him rest in peace. The spark is quenched,
the bowl is broken&mdash;that is Gustav."</p>

<p>But it happens usually that people after his
death speak much of a man whom during life
they almost buffeted. Let us give peace then
to Gustav, and follow the further fortune of
our acquaintances, and especially of Yosef, the
hero of this volume.</p>

<p>With him nothing had changed, but he himself
from the time of his first visit to Pani
Helena went about as if in meditation and was
silent.</p>

<p>Augustinovich accustomed himself more and
more to the new condition.</p>

<p>At the general's the guests danced as before.
At the engineer's they pounded on the piano.
The countess sang in the evening. Gustav's
room was occupied by a shoemaker who had
two scrofulous descendants and a wife with a
third misery. In the place where thoughts
from a noble head had circled and words of
warmth had dropped, were now heard the
thread and the shoemaker's stirrup.</p>

<p>The widow did not hear of Gustav's death
immediately; Yosef concealed it, fearing too
violent an impression. Later he was astonished
to find that she received the news with sadness,
it is true, but with no sign of despair. We
have much to tell of those new relations; in
the succeeding part we shall pass to them
directly.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yosef</span>, according to his promise given Gustav,
visited Helena, and after the second visit went
away in love. He returned late at night.
The stars were twinkling on a serene sky;
from the Dnieper came the cool, but bracing
breath of water. Light streaks of mist wound
in a long line on the east. There was music
in the air and music in Yosef's breast. He
was in love! It seemed to him that the serene
night had visited his betrothal with happiness.
Full happiness is both a remembrance and a
hope. Yosef felt yet in his palms the small
hands of Helena; he remembered that moment,
thought of the tenderness of the morrow,
looked forward to that moment. A wonderful
thing! She took farewell of him with the
word, "Remember;" but who could forget
happiness, especially when the future is smiling
with it?</p>

<p>He loved! Pressed by the power and the
charm of the night, the trembling of the stars
and the majesty of dark expanses, he cast a
look full of fire to the remotest borders of
heavenly loneliness, and whispered with quivering
lips,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If Thou exist! Thou art great and good."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the condition set up before
this statement, that for Yosef was very
much.</p>

<p>He recognized greatness and goodness. He
said, "If Thou art." If those words had been
spoken about some being, they would be conditional;
spoken to some being they were an
affirmation of existence: "Thou art."</p>

<p>In spite of all his realism let us not wonder
so much at these words. The lips which pronounced
them had drunk freshly from the cup
of ecstasy.</p>

<p>When Yosef reached home, Augustinovich
was sleeping in the best fashion possible; his
snoring was heard even on the stairway. He
drew out the song of slumber, now short, now
long, now lower, now higher, now puffing, now
blowing, now whistling.</p>

<p>Yosef roused him.</p>

<p>He determined finally to embrace him.</p>

<p>Augustinovich stared at him with astonished
eyes, and at the first moment cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go to the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yosef laughed joyously.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" said Augustinovich. "I will
tell thee to-morrow where thou art coming
from&mdash;now I wish to sleep&mdash;good-night."</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. In the morning
Yosef poured the tea; Augustinovich, lying in
bed yet, and looking at the ceiling, was smoking
a pipe. Both were thinking of the day
previous.</p>

<p>Finally Augustinovich was the first to
speak,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost thou know what has come to my
head?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell thee. I will tell thee that
it is not worth while to attach one's life to the
first woman that comes along; as I wish well to
Jove, it is not! There are better things in this
world."</p>

<p>"Whence did those ideas come to thee?"</p>

<p>"Straight from the pipe. A man so binds
himself to an idea, grows one with it completely,
and then something comes and, behold!
of those palaces as much remains as of
the smoke which I blow out at this moment."</p>

<p>An immense roll of smoke rose up from
Augustinovich's lips, and striking the ceiling
was scattered on all sides.</p>

<p>The conversation was stopped for a while.</p>

<p>"Yosef, hadst thou been in love before
knowing Gustav and Pani Helena?"</p>

<p>"Had I lo-v-ed?" drawled Yosef, looking
at the light through his glass of tea. "What?
had I loved? Yes, I turned my head for a
moment, but that did not push me out of life's
ordinary conditions, it did not lead me out of
the order of the day. I will say sincerely,
though, that I have not been in love."</p>

<p>Augustinovich, raising the stem of his pipe,
began to declaim with solemnity,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O woman! helpless down! O giddy creature!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Yosef, laughing.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my reminiscences. Ei, it was
different with me. I was as mad as a maniac a
couple of times. Once, even in spite of misery,
I tried to be an orderly person; it was difficult,
but I tried."</p>

<p>"And how did it end?"</p>

<p>"Prosaically. I was giving lessons in a certain
house. There were two children, a little
son and a grown-up daughter. I taught the son
and fell in love with the daughter. I told her
this one evening, and tears came to my eyes.
She was confused a little, and then she laughed.
Thou wilt not believe, Yosef, what an ugly
laugh that was, for she saw how much the
confession had cost me, and besides she had
enticed me on, to begin with. She went at
once with a complaint to her 'mamma.'"</p>

<p>"Well, what did the mamma do?"</p>

<p>"The 'mamma' told me first that I was a
scrub, whereupon I bowed to her; second she
told me to go my way, and third she threw a
five-ruble note on the floor before me. I
picked up the note, for it belonged to me, and
from it I got drunk that evening and next
morning also."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then the next evening and the third
morning."</p>

<p>"And so on?"</p>

<p>"No. On the fourth day I had an immense
cry, and later, when I had cured myself a
little, not of drinking, but of love, I tried to
fall in love with the first woman I met; but I
could not love any more, I give thee my word
of honor."</p>

<p>"And hast thou no hope for the future?"</p>

<p>Augustinovich thought a moment, and
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I have no respect now for women. As
much as I believed in them before, as much as
I honored and loved them as the highest
reward of toil and effort, that much do I like
them now, dost understand? That excludes
love."</p>

<p>"But happiness."</p>

<p>"Not a word about happiness. So to-day I
whistle when I want to cry, and therefore envy
thee."</p>

<p>Yosef looked quickly at Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"What dost thou envy me?"</p>

<p>"Thy relation with Pani Helena. Do not
frown, and do not wonder that I know those
things well. Ho, ho! we have had a little
experience. For that matter I will tell thee
that I wanted myself to fall in love with Pani
Helena. I prefer such women. Though, on
the other hand&mdash;But do I know that thou
wilt not be angry?"</p>

<p>"Talk on."</p>

<p>"I was afraid to fall in love with her. There
is no denying that she is an unhappy woman,
but, by the beard of the Prophet! what is that
to me? I know only that the inheritance goes
from hand to hand, and that whoso approaches
her is happy for the ages. B-r-r! By my honor
I should not wish to be the heir to such a
legacy, even for a friend."</p>

<p>Yosef put the glass of partly drunk tea on
the table, and turning to Augustinovich said
coldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; but since I am the executor of the
will, be so kind as to speak of the inheritance
more considerately."</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell thee in perfect seriousness
not this, who or what the widow is, but what
thou shouldst do. I speak disinterestedly. I
speak even to my own harm. The affair is of
this kind." Augustinovich sat up in bed. "I
know thee, I know her; she will rush into thy
arms herself. Initiative on the part of a
woman&mdash;Ho! that is not good! Love must
be a conquest. In a month thou wilt be sick
of her, thou wilt be tortured and throw her to
the devil. Yosef, I wish thee well&mdash;marry
Helena while there is time."</p>

<p>Yosef frowned more than before, and answered
abruptly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will do what I think is proper."</p>

<p>And really that little word "marry" had
not come to his head yet. While kissing the
widow's hands he had not thought of the consequences
of the kisses. He was angry at
himself, and at this more especially, that some
one had reminded him of duties of conscience.
A day later, two days later, he would have
reminded himself of them beyond fail. The
reminder coming from another took away
from this thought the charm of spontaneous
action which flows from love and made it
constraint.</p>

<p>The evening of that day Augustinovich met
Vasilkevich.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou that Yosef visits the widow
now?" asked he.</p>

<p>"What wonder?"</p>

<p>"The woman is in love with him to distraction.
Think what will come of that, and judge
what Yosef ought to do."</p>

<p>"He ought to love her too," answered Vasilkevich,
with his usual decision.</p>

<p>"Yes; and then?"</p>

<p>"Then let them marry."</p>

<p>Augustinovich waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>"One other question. How wouldst thou
act with Pani Helena?"</p>

<p>"If I loved her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I should marry her without hesitation."</p>

<p>Augustinovich stopped him, and with his
hand on his heart began to speak in a tone of
deep conviction,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seest thou, I am much indebted to Yosef,
for that matter thou knowest this best of all, I
should like then to pay him honestly,&mdash;yes,
to pay him with advice. He is in a strange
position, and still, dost understand, there are
certain laws of honor which we are not permitted
to break. I should not wish that any
man at any time could say to Yosef, 'Thou
hast acted dishonorably.' I say openly I
should not wish that. Thou canst do much,
thou hast influence over him."</p>

<p>Vasilkevich, instead of letting himself be
persuaded, grew angry.</p>

<p>"But why push into affairs which are not
thine? Leave him freedom. It is only a little
while since he began to visit her. Ei! Augustinovich,
does this come from thy heart? If
Helena is anything to thee, then may I&mdash;But
this is interfering&mdash;thou lovest to pose and
speak well-sounding words. Play no comedy!
Thou art making a sacrifice as it were by
losing lodgings through Yosef's marriage, but
that is mere levity. Thou art deceiving thyself
without knowing it. Have no fear as to
Yosef; if thou wert like him, no more would be
needed. What hast thou to do with this matter?
Thou hast not tact to the value of a copper."</p>

<p>"Keep these lessons for thy own use! Then
thou wilt not interfere between them?"</p>

<p>"If this undefined relation were to last long,
I should be the first to try and persuade, and
finally to force Yosef to marry her; but to
interfere to-day would be stupid."</p>

<p>Augustinovich went home, greatly confused;
a feeling of truth told him, however, that the
Lithuanian was right, and that on his part it
would be really meddling and a desire for
posing, nothing more.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A couple</span> of months had passed, winter had
passed, spring had passed, summer had come,
and those relations had not changed.</p>

<p>Yosef loved Helena, she loved him, and
their life flowed on in mutual forgetfulness
of the future. But there was a shadow between
them, a shadow thrown by chance. One
summer day the widow tied under her chin
the ribbons of a dainty blue hat, and covering
her shoulders with a cape, she took Yosef's
arm and they went out to walk.</p>

<p>The sun was shining, there was a little dust in
the air, and the heat made itself felt on all faces,
though the hour was about six in the afternoon.
Multitudes of people were on the streets;
many acquaintances greeted Yosef with a
friendly nod; some, and among them strangers,
looked around at our couple. Really they
were a beautiful couple. Yosef had grown,
he had become manly; his chin and the sides
of his face were covered now by a splendid,
ruddy growth, and his face had a serious expression,
with a certain tinge of pride. The
widow looked exactly like a young betrothed.
The wind blew apart the ribbons of her dainty
hat, played with her white dress, and bearing
apart the cape, showed her slender form. Leaning
on Yosef's arm gracefully, she delighted
in him and the sun and the air, and was as if
born into the world a second time. Yosef
looked more at her than at the people around.
We will not undertake to repeat the words in
that twittering of lovers, without meaning for
others, full of charm for themselves. But there
was more serious conversation; she, for example,
begged him to take her to Potkanski's
grave.</p>

<p>"In the summer," said she, "there is much
shade even in the cemetery. And it is so
long since I was there; still I cannot forget
him. Thou takest his place, Yosef, but permit
me to pray for him sometimes."</p>

<p>It was all one to Yosef for whom or for
what Helena prayed; so he answered with an
indulgent smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, remember thy dead; but love
the living," added he, inclining his head toward
her face.</p>

<p>A slight pressing of Yosef's arm to her breast
was Helena's answer. She looked him in the
eyes, then blushed like a girl.</p>

<p>Yosef covered with his palm the little hand
resting on his arm, and&mdash;was perfectly happy.</p>

<p>They went to the cemetery, and on the
way met Augustinovich; he was smoking a
cigar and walking with two ladies, a mother and
a daughter. Augustinovich had the daughter
on his arm, the mother hurried on a little at
one side; plumpness and finally the heat hindered
her haste somewhat.</p>

<p>Augustinovich was eloquent evidently, for
the young lady restrained her laughter at
moments. While passing Yosef he blinked
with one eye; this was to signify that he was
content with the world and the order of the
earth at that moment.</p>

<p>Yosef asked Helena about Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"I know him, though I do not know his
name. When Kazimir died, I saw him near
me, then he disappeared somehow from my
eyes."</p>

<p>"He is the most gifted scapegrace whom I
know," added Yosef. "But he told me that
he was in love with my lady."</p>

<p>"Why tell me that?"</p>

<p>"Without an object, but it is a wonder how
all are attracted to thee."</p>

<p>"My dear Yosef, that is the one thing that
I brought to the world with me. Thou wilt
not believe how sadly the years of my childhood
passed. Thou knowest not my history.
I was reared in a wealthy family, where the
master of the house treated me as his own
daughter. After his death I was tormented in
that house with every rudeness, till at last I fled
and came to Kieff, where an old and very kind
man took me into his care. He called me Helusiu
always, and petted me as if I had been
his own daughter. But afterward he too died,
without leaving me means of living. Then I
made the acquaintance of Kazimir. Thou wilt
wonder how I went to a students' club? I
lacked little of dying from shame, I assure
thee, when I entered the first time; but wilt
thou believe? I was hungry. I had put nothing
in my mouth for two days. I was chilled
through, I knew not what I was doing, and
what it would lead to.</p>

<p>"Then Kazimir approached me. Oh! he did
not please me that time. He laughed and was
glad, but it grew dark in my eyes. He asked
at last if I would go with him. I answered
'Yes.' On the road he put a warm fur around
me, for I was shivering from cold, and finally
he took me to his lodgings. There, when
warmth had restored presence of mind to me,
I saw where I was, and I wept from disgrace
and shame. For, seest thou, I was alone in
the lodgings of a man, I was in his power. He
seemed to be astonished at my weeping; then
he was silent and sat near me, and when again
I looked at him he had tears in his eyes, and
was different entirely. He kissed my hands
and begged me to calm myself.</p>

<p>"I had to tell him everything, everything.
He promised to think of me as a sister. How
good he was, was he not? From that moment
of knowing him I knew no more of want. At
parting he kissed my hand again. I wished to
kiss his, my heart was straitened, I pressed it
with my hands and wept real tears. Oh! how
I loved him then! how I loved him!"</p>

<p>Helena raised her eyes, in those eyes gleamed
great tears of gratitude. She was as beautiful
as if inspired. Yosef's expression, however,
was severe; his brows had come together on
his forehead. The thought that he owed that
woman's love to empty chance, to a vain resemblance,
covered his face with a gloomy
shadow.</p>

<p>Potkanski had gone to her by another road.
That comparison pained Yosef. He recalled
Augustinovich's words, and conducted Helena
farther in silence.</p>

<p>They reached the cemetery. Among the
trees were white crosses, stones, and tombs.
The city of the dead in the shade of green
leaves slept in silent dignity. A number of
persons were strolling among the crosses;
among the branches a bird from time to time
sang half sadly, half charmingly. The figure
of the cemetery guard pushed past at intervals.</p>

<p>Helena soon found Potkanski's grave. It
was a large mound surrounded by an iron
railing; at the foot of the mound was a small
grass-covered hillock. Under these lay Potkanski
with Helena's child. A number of pots
with flowers adorned the graves, at the sides grew
reseda; in general, the grave kept neatly and
even with ornament indicated a careful hand.</p>

<p>Yosef called the guard to open the railing.
Helena knelt there with prayer on her lips and
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Who keeps this grave?" asked Yosef of
the guard.</p>

<p>"This lady came; a gentleman with long
hair came also, but now he comes no longer.
He always paid for the flowers, and he also
gave command to erect the iron grating."</p>

<p>"That gentleman is here now&mdash;last year
they buried him," answered Yosef.</p>

<p>The guard nodded as if to say, "And thou
too wilt dwell here."</p>

<p>"But this I beg to tell the gentlemen. In
the city out there are trouble and suffering,
but when any one comes here he lies peacefully.
I think often to myself: 'Will the
Lord God torture souls in that other world
also? Is it little that man suffers here?'"</p>

<p>After a time Helena finished praying. Yosef
gave her his arm again. Yosef was silent;
evidently something was weighing on his heart.
By design or by chance he led Helena along a
path different from the first one. All at once,
when near the gate, he pointed to one of the
graves, and said in a kind of cold voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"See, Helena, that man there loved thee
during his life more than Potkanski, and still
thou hast not mentioned him."</p>

<p>The day was inclining. Helena cast her
eye on the object which Yosef had indicated.
At the grave stood a black wooden cross, and
on it were written in white the words: "Gustav&mdash;died
year&mdash;day."</p>

<p>The evening rays painted the inscription as
it were in letters of blood.</p>

<p>"Let us go from here; it is getting dark,"
whispered Helena, nestling her head up to
Yosef's shoulder.</p>

<p>When they entered the city, darkness was
beginning in earnest, but a clear night was
coming. A great ruddy moon was rolling
up from beyond the Dnieper. In the dense
alleys of the police garden steps were heard
here and there, from an open window in an
adjoining pavilion came the tones of a piano;
a youthful, feeble voice was singing a song
of Schubert, the tones quivered in the warm
air; far, far out on the steppe some one was
sounding the horn of a post-wagon.</p>

<p>"A beautiful night," said Helena, in a low
voice. "Why art thou gloomy, Yosef?"</p>

<p>"Let us sit a little," said he. "I am tired."</p>

<p>They sat there, and leaning shoulder to
shoulder were both somewhat pensive. They
were roused on a sudden from meditation by
a youthful, resonant voice, which said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"True, Karol! The greatest happiness is
the genuine love of a woman, if it is an echo
to the voice of a real manly soul."</p>

<p>Two young people arm in arm passed slowly
near the bench on which Yosef and Helena
were sitting.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said both, removing their
hats.</p>

<p>They were Vasilkevich and Karol Karvovski.</p>

<p>When Yosef parted with the widow that
evening, he held her hand to his lips for a long
time, and went home late, greatly agitated.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">But</span> next day Yosef after a perfect sleep was
quite calm; he even laughed at the previous
day and at his own alarms and fears.</p>

<p>"Many pretty phrases are uttered," said he
to himself, "but are they reality? Only a
fool regrets happiness. Gustav is the best
proof of this. What good is feeling, though
the strongest, though the most manly, when
purchased at the cost of life? Besides, I am
little fitted for tragedy. I love Helena, and
she me. What is that to any one? Augustinovich,
rise, O scapegrace! tell me what
hundred-tongued Satan has turned the head of
some brown parasol by means of thee?"</p>

<p>"Didst thou see her face?" inquired Augustinovich,
forcing himself to sigh.</p>

<p>"I did, and by Jove, it was like a freshly
plucked radish&mdash;the mother looked like a
bowl of sour milk. Well, art thou in love, old
man?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet! those are very rich ladies."</p>

<p>"Both? How much has the daughter?"</p>

<p>"Who has counted such a treasure&mdash;but
she will be richer yet."</p>

<p>"Richer&mdash;by a husband and children?"</p>

<p>"No; but the mother has come on a lawsuit,
and dost know whom she is suing? Our
neighbor the count owes her several thousand
zlotys."</p>

<p>"From whom dost thou know all this? Art
long acquainted with the ladies?"</p>

<p>"Only since yesterday. I became acquainted
by chance: they inquired for the street&mdash;whither? I did not mind, 'pon my honor, but
I told them that the weather was very beautiful,
and asked if they would not walk with me.
The old lady loves conversation dearly. I
learned immediately who they were, and why
they had come to the city. She asked me if
I knew the count. I answered that I visit him
daily, and that I would use my influence on
the old man to pay what he owes her. I said
also that I was a doctor of medicine, theology,
and many other sciences and arts; that I have
an immense practice in Kieff. Then the mother
began to tell into my ear her troubles and the
troubles of her daughter. I promised to visit
them and to examine their case carefully."</p>

<p>"Of course. What did the daughter say to
that?"</p>

<p>"She hung out the red flag on her face, but
the mother scolded her for doing so, called
on all the saints, and assured me of the unanimous
assistance of those saints at the day of
general judgment. Thou seest what I have
won."</p>

<p>"Thou art an innocent."</p>

<p>"I shall visit them to-day."</p>

<p>"Whom? all the saints?"</p>

<p>"No, my new acquaintances. I will advise
them both to marry."</p>

<p>"The youngest thee?"</p>

<p>"What dost thou wish, my dear? A man
grows old; moreover, I think that we shall
greet thee soon with a hairy palm."</p>

<p>"I have begged thee not to interfere between
me and Helena."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will say only that Pani Helena
is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Surely!" answered Yosef, with ill-concealed
pleasure.</p>

<p>At that moment Vasilkevich appeared.</p>

<p>"I have run in a moment," said he. "Karol
is waiting downstairs for me; we are going to
the country together. Yosef, I have business
with thee. Briefly, I did not wish to mix in
thy love affairs, notwithstanding Augustinovich's
prayers, but this is dragging on too
long. Tell me, what dost thou think of doing
with the widow?"</p>

<p>Yosef had a pipe in his hand; this he hurled
violently into the corner of the room; then he
sat down and looked Vasilkevich in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Question for question," said he. "Tell
me, what hast thou to do with the matter?"</p>

<p>Vasilkevich frowned, became somewhat
angry; still he answered calmly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ask as one comrade may ask another.
Helena is not of that class of women who love
one day but not the day following. Besides,
through the memory of Potkanski each of his
colleagues has the right to expect an answer
to such a question."</p>

<p>Yosef rose; in his eyes blazes of anger were
flashing.</p>

<p>"But if I give no answer, then what?" cried
he.</p>

<p>Vasilkevich burst out in his turn,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then thou thinkest, my bird, that we are
going to let thee dupe this poor woman, and
not ask what thy meaning is? Satan take
thee! Thou must answer to us for the honor
of Potkanski's widow. I am not the only man
who will inquire about it."</p>

<p>They stood some time face to face, eye to
eye, each with a storm on his forehead, as
if testing each other. Finally Yosef, though
trembling with anger, was the first to regain
self-mastery.</p>

<p>"Hear me, Vasilkevich," said he. "If some
other man had done this, I should have thrown
him out of doors. I am not of those who let
themselves be regulated, and I do not understand
why thou and others mix in affairs not
your own. In every case this offends me. I
will answer, therefore, thee and all who wish to
mention the honor of Helena, that I will give
account of that honor only to myself, that I
shall not permit any man to meddle with my
acts, and that thou and thine are committing
a brutal, and for Helena a harmful stupidity,
in no way to be explained by your taking
her part. I have done speaking and I am
going out, leaving thee time to meditate over
what thou hast done."</p>

<p>Vasilkevich remained with Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"Well? Did not he give thee a head-washing?"
inquired the latter.</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Hei! wilt thou say, then, that he gave thee
a head-washing?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Thou hast acted stupidly; with him mildness
was needed&mdash;that is a headstrong fellow."</p>

<p>Yosef went straight to Helena. He was excited
in the highest degree; he could not
explain Vasilkevich's act, but he felt that
that third hand, interfering between him and
Helena, pushed them apart instead of bringing
them nearer.</p>

<p>When he entered Helena's lodgings, the
door of her chamber was closed; the maid
could not tell him what her mistress was doing.
He opened the door. Helena was sleeping,
leaning against the arm of a large easy-chair.
Yosef stood in the doorway and looked at her
with a wonderful expression on his face. She
did not waken; her rounded breast rose and
fell with a light measured movement. There
is nothing gentler than the movement of a
woman's breast; resting on it, it is possible to
be rocked to sleep as in a cradle, or in a boat
moved lightly by the waves. Every man has
passed through that sleep on his mother's
breast. The secret kingdom of sleep is revealed
in woman by this movement only, which
may be called blessed, so many conditions of
human happiness move with it in the regions of
rest. The movement of angels' wings must be
like it. It lulls to rest everything, from the cry
of the infant, to the proud thoughts of the sage.
The head of a sage, sleeping on the breast of a
woman, is the highest triumph of love. Such
thoughts must have passed through Yosef's
head, for, looking at the slumbering Helena, he
grew milder and milder, just as night passes
into dawn; he inclined toward her, and touched
her hand lightly with his lips.</p>

<p>Helena quivered, and, opening her eyes
widely, smiled like a little child when the
velvety kiss of its mother rouses it from
sleep. That was the first time that Yosef
came to her with a fondling so gentle and
delicate; usually he came, if not severe, dignified;
but to-day he had come to wipe out
and forget at her feet the bitter impressions
of the quarrel with Vasilkevich. He was
seized gradually by the marvellous power of
woman, under whose influence the muddy
deposit of the soul sinks to the bottom of
oblivion. But he was too greatly agitated
not to let some of the bitterness which he
felt a few moments earlier press through his
words. He raised his head, looked into her
eyes, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Helena, it seems to me that I love thee
very deeply; but the folly of people irritates
my personality, challenges me. I should like
to find strength in thee. Trust me, Helena,
love me!"</p>

<p>"I do not understand thee," replied she.</p>

<p>He took her hand and spoke tenderly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Still, thou shouldst understand me. I
flatter myself that I am not second to Potkanski
in love for thee, or in labor for thy happiness.
But there is a difference between us.
He was the son of a magnate, he could give
thee his hand at once, surround thee with
plenty. I am the son of a handicraftsman, I
must labor long yet over thy happiness and
my own. I will not desert thee now, but I do
not wish that thou as my wife shouldst touch
the cold realities of poverty, from which he
disaccustomed thee. But I need thy love and
thy confidence. Speak, Helena."</p>

<p>Helena said nothing; but she approached
Yosef, and, putting her head on his breast,
raised on him eyes full of childlike confidence.</p>

<p>"This is my answer, my good Helenko,"
said Yosef; and with a long kiss he joined
her lips to his.</p>

<p>"This may be egotism on my part," continued
he, "but forgive me. I did not win
thee by service or suffering, I have done
nothing whatever for thee. The vision of
wealth with which Potkanski surrounded thee
on the one hand, the devotion of Gustav on
the other, would stand forever between us.
Let me deserve thee, Helena. I have energy
and strength sufficient, I will not deceive
thee."</p>

<p>Perhaps it seemed to Yosef that he was
speaking sincerely; but how much offended
vanity there was in his words each person
may divine easily after casting an eye on the
conditions in which Helena had lived up to
that time. If he had asked for her hand
immediately, those conditions would have
changed very little, and certainly not for the
worse, since in that case, sharing his lodgings
with her, he would have rid himself of
Augustinovich and all the outlays connected
with that man. On the other hand, it is proper
to acknowledge that he kept the word given
Gustav with complete conscientiousness.
Nothing had changed with reference to
Helena. Yosef would have taken her at that
time in the same conditions in which she had
been for two years past.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt one half was true in what he
had told her of his ambition; more meaning
still was there in his wish to throw down the
gauntlet to opponents; but perhaps the weightiest
reason of all why he did not marry Helena
was found in the relations, of great intimacy
between them of people not united by bonds
which give more than the right to fondling and
kisses. The cup was half drunk. Legalization
would lessen the charm of forbidden fruit,
would decrease sweetness already tasted, more
than it would promise new.</p>

<p>It will appear that Augustinovich was right
in some degree.</p>

<p>Yosef perhaps did not acknowledge to himself
that his reason for not desiring to change
those relations was because he lived agreeably
in them.</p>

<p>Did he not love Helena, then?</p>

<p>He loved her; otherwise he would not have
visited her daily, he would not have kissed
her lips, her forehead, her hands; but let us
remember that this met just half the desires
which in other conditions we satisfy through
the way of the altar. The idea of a betrothed
is that of a woman disrobed behind a thin
veil, we go to the altar to remove the veil;
when the veil disappears a part of the charm
is lost. Honest human nature recompenses
the loss by the idea of attachment; when
attachment fails, habit, a thing still less enticing,
appears in the place of it.</p>

<p>But life rolls on.</p>

<p>Yosef had touched the veil; two ways led
to its removal,&mdash;one the way of the altar; the
other a momentary oblivion of self, a victory
of passion over honor,&mdash;a less honest, in fact
a dishonest, way, but short and alluring.</p>

<p>The first was difficult; to the second every
moment was a temptation, every kiss an incitement.
To the first the unfortunate guardianship
over Helena disinclined him; selfishness
counselled the second. But the first was honorable,
the second was not.</p>

<p>Yosef stood at the parting of the roads.</p>

<p>It might be said, indeed, that an honest man
should not hesitate; but we may also inquire
how an honest man is to act when the powers
of temptation are absolutely greater than his
powers of honesty.</p>

<p>Helena loved Yosef; she answered nervously
to his kisses. She was unable to turn
the balance consciously; unconsciously she
added to the weight of that defect which in
Yosef's soul weighed against honesty and
honor.</p>

<p>How many great and small battles, torments
and terrors, that magic little word <em>love</em> brings
with it sometimes! A whole rabble of wishes
with outbreak and uproar, armed with goads
and bells, a rabble capricious, violent, flies up
from every direction, plays with the human
heart as with a ball, hurls it to the lofty stars,
or tramples it on the earth. Then, O man,
all the dens of thy soul are thrown open.
Thou hadst not even dreamed of what dwelt
in them. All the seven deadly sins, and all
the virtues of which the catechism makes
mention, are fighting each other to win thee;
thou seest thyself to be different from what
thou hadst supposed up to that time; thou
ceasest to trust thyself, suspectest thyself at
every step, losest control of thyself. Passions
rise up then like flames from the depth of thy
being, and like hidden currents in a swamp,
advance, creep, circle about, flow up, and then
vanish.</p>

<p>The night of thy soul is rent by the flame
of passions. In their colors thy own interior
is shown to thee. Thou performest the
rles both of actor and audience. Thou art
like a boat, without a rudder in billows of
fire. Then, on a sudden, one thunderbolt
finishes everything; the flames vanish like
fireworks, and thou art dreaming, like Dante,
of heaven and hell.</p>

<p>It is gloomy when after the awakening there
is no one to give back the moments through
which thou hast suffered. Calmness returns,
but happiness returns not. An amputated
arm gives no pain, but it does not exist.</p>

<p>It may be that Augustinovich had some
truth on his side, when he said that it was not
worth while to give life for a single feeling.
Perhaps a man should not break himself
against the narrow walls of personal whims and
desires.</p>

<p>Above and around us is a broad world;
waves are roaring there which have been raised
by the whole of humanity. Is it not better to
weigh anchor and push one's ship forth from
the shore, quiet the weeping heart, and sail out
into a future, without happiness but with labor,
without faith but with thought?</p>

<p>It is certain that till the time of such a fiery
test comes it is not possible to speak of the
nobility of the metal out of which the soul of
a given man has been cast. We can offer no
guarantees, therefore, for the future acts of
Yosef. He passed through various temptations,
we know that; we guarantee that he
fought with them according to his power; but
how it ended, whether he or they proved the
stronger, will be told later on.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching home Yosef met the old count
and his daughter on the steps at the door.
The young lady cast a glance of inquiry on
him, and when she had gone a couple of steps,
she looked around and smiled. Yosef noticed
that she was very shapely, and with genuine
satisfaction he heard her say to her father,
"That is the young doctor, papa, who lives
in the rooms under ours." It is true that he
lacked little of finishing his course at the
University; still he was glad that they considered
him a doctor already.</p>

<p>Yosef's lodgings were open; the house guard
was putting them to rights. From him Yosef
learned details of the old count and his
daughter. This man did not like either of
them; he emphasized their stinginess, though
he imagined that they must be very poor,
because they did not pay room rent very
regularly. "The young lady is haughty,"
said he; "all day she does nothing but play
and sing. It is hard for her without a husband,
but what is to be done?" He did not
advise Yosef to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p>"How proud these people are," said he;
"but in their pockets, dear lord, there is
emptiness."</p>

<p>"And is the old countess long dead?" inquired
Yosef.</p>

<p>"About three years. They have been rich,
I suppose, but he lost his property in wheat
which, as they say, he had to furnish in company
with others at Odessa. That business
impoverished many people. The old countess
was better than others of her family. She was
an honorable lady, but she fell to grieving, and
died. They have lived here five years."</p>

<p>"Do they know many people?"</p>

<p>"It must be that they do not, for I have
not seen any one visit them."</p>

<p>Yosef, while waiting for Augustinovich, lay
down on the bed, and when he commanded
to bring him a glass of tea, he fell asleep
quickly. When he woke up, he felt a trifle
ill. Augustinovich had not come yet, though
it was quite dark. He arrived at last in
perfect humor.</p>

<p>The lady with whom he had become acquainted,
Pani Visberg, had a daughter Malinka.
Augustinovich examined them both
by auscultation. He prescribed dancing for
the daughter and horseback riding for the
mother. Besides, he promised to visit them
and to bring Yosef.</p>

<p>"The old lady said that the summons to
the count was ready, which does not concern
me," said Augustinovich. "She has even
visited the count, but found only the countess,
who pleased her. The countess was much
frightened when she learned the object of the
old lady's visit. I asked Pani Visberg why
she claimed a miserable two thousand when
she represented herself as the wife of a Cr&#339;sus.
She answered that her late husband's name
was Cleophas, not Cr&#339;sus. 'If it were mine,'
said she, 'I surely would not annoy them,
but all that money belongs to my child.'
Then I pressed the hand of that child under
the table, with real feeling. I was simply
moved&mdash;word of honor, I was moved. When
going, I kissed the old lady's hand. The young
lady's name is Malinka&mdash;a pretty name, Malinka,
though the point is not in this, whether
her name is pretty or ugly&mdash;Why art thou
so pale, Yosef?"</p>

<p>"I am not entirely well, and I cannot sleep.
I fell asleep while waiting for thee. Give me
a glass of tea."</p>

<p>Augustinovich poured out the tea, and lighting
his pipe lay on the bed. Yosef pushed an
armchair up to the bureau, and taking a pen
began to write.</p>

<p>He soon stopped, however. Thoughts
crowded into his head; he leaned back in the
chair and gave them free course. Another
man would have dreamed. Yosef collected
and summed up his own past; he thought over
the conditions in which he was then, he cast
up the future. Regarding this future, it was
difficult for him to remain in the rle of a cool
reasoner. The words "That is the young
doctor, papa," came to his memory involuntarily.
To be a doctor and to some extent a high-priest
of science; to rule on one side by reason,
on the other by significance, property, reputation,&mdash;Yosef
had not become indifferent yet to
reputation,&mdash;to attract glances, rouse laughter,
win hearts&mdash;Here he remembered Helena.
In the region of feeling he was not free now
to choose. He felt bound; still he would like
to see eyes turning to him, and the smile of the
maiden's lips, and hear the words so prettily
whispered, "That is the young doctor." For
the first time he could not free himself of the
thought that Helena might be a hindrance to
his campaign of advancement. He determined
to settle with that thought. Her education
was not in the way, she was educated; she was
twenty-one years of age, he twenty-four&mdash;the
difference, though too small, did not constitute
a hindrance. What reasons could he have to
fear that Helena might be a weight on him
some time? Conscience declared that the first
cause was his own vanity. He knew women
little, and he wanted to know them much and
to rule them. But there were other considerations
which Yosef did not admit. He loved too
little. In his soul lay enormous capitals of
feeling; he had barely offered a small part of
them in the name of Helena. He bore within
him a dim consciousness of his powers; that
foreboding deprived him of rest. He wanted
to reach the foundation of things, but it was
not easy for even such a self-conscious head
as Yosef's to reach final results.</p>

<p>Besides, he did not know himself whether
possible future triumphs were equal in value to
Helena. To have near him for all future time
a woman so charming and loving was the same
as to seize in its flight a winged dream of happiness
shooting by, but if besides he knew how
many of those coming triumphs would be of
tangible value, how many would deceive him,
how many faces there were before him, he
would not hesitate in the choice. But he had
not met deceit yet face to face.</p>

<p>Such meditations wearied Yosef. The lamp
in the room grew dim, he began to doze. Some
sudden knocking above roused him again.
"They are not sleeping up there, either,"
thought he. He remembered the countess and
her gladsome smile. "How lightly and calmly
such a girl must sleep! But there is some
truth in this, that girls are like birds. A man
toils and labors and meditates, and they&mdash;But
that one upstairs is quite a pretty bird. I
should like to see her asleep. But it is late
now, half-past one, and I&mdash;What is that?"
He sprang quickly to his feet.</p>

<p>A violent pulling at the bell brought him to
his senses perfectly. He opened the door, and
raising the lamp saw the countess before him.
She was as pale as a corpse; she held a candle
in one hand, with the other she protected the
flame of it. She wore a cap, and a dressing-gown
through which her neck and bosom were
evident.</p>

<p>"Pan Doctor!" cried she, "my father is
dying!"</p>

<p>Yosef, without saying a word, seized his
medicine case, and enjoining on Augustinovich
to hurry upstairs with all speed, he ran himself
after her. In the first chamber was the
small bed of the countess, with the blanket
thrown aside, and left just a moment before;
in the next room lay the count. He was
breathing or rather rattling loudly, for he was
unconscious; there was bloody foam on his lips,
and his face was livid.</p>

<p>In a moment Augustinovich ran in, uncombed
and hardly dressed. Both occupied
themselves with the sick man without regard
to the young girl, who had knelt at the foot of
the bed, and was nearly unconscious.</p>

<p>All at once Yosef and Augustinovich looked
each other in the eyes; both had seen that
there was not the least hope.</p>

<p>"O my God! my God! Call in some one
else, perhaps," burst out the countess, in
tears.</p>

<p>"Run for Skotnitski," cried Yosef.</p>

<p>Augustinovich ran, although he felt certain
that on returning with the doctor he would not
find the count among the living.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Yosef, with all energy and presence
of mind, worked at the patient. He bled
him; then, looking at the clock, declared that
the attack was over.</p>

<p>"Thank God! There is hope then?" cried
the countess.</p>

<p>"The attack is over!" repeated Yosef.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Augustinovich came with the
doctor.</p>

<p>Doctor Skotnitski declared that the sick man
was saved for that time, but without ceremony
he added that in case of a second attack death
would ensue unfailingly. He commanded to
watch the sick man and not leave him for an
instant. Our friends sat all night at his
bedside.</p>

<p>Next morning early the count regained consciousness
and asked for a priest. Augustinovich
had to go for one. He brought some
parish priest or chaplain, who read the usual
prayers and litany, then heard the sick man's
confession, gave him communion, and anointed
him with holy oil.</p>

<p>For a number of hours the count was
conscious; he spoke with Yosef, blessed his
daughter, spoke of his will, in a word, did
everything which is usual when people are
dying in a Christian and honest way of going
from this world to the other. The whole day
passed in these ceremonies. When dusk came
Yosef persuaded the countess to take some
rest; for the poor girl, though of a firm constitution,
was barely able to stand on her feet
from watching and suffering.</p>

<p>She resisted long, and agreed only when he
almost commanded her to do so. When leaving
the room she gave her hand, thanking him
for his care of her father. Yosef looked at
her more carefully then. She might have
been twenty, perhaps even less, for her well-developed
form caused one to consider her
older than she was really. She had a large
but agreeable mouth, blue, clever eyes, and
dark hair. In general, her face was uncommonly
sympathetic. She had a beautiful forehead
shaded with hair; the expression of her
face, and her movements indicated a developed
aristocratic type of beauty. Moreover,
she had very small hands.</p>

<p>The count fell asleep an hour after she had
gone out. Yosef and Augustinovich sat by a
shaded lamp; both were wearied and thoughtful.
Augustinovich spoke first in a low
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me what will become of the countess
when he&mdash;" He indicated with his head the
sick man, and closing his eyes drew a finger
along his throat.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of that myself," replied Yosef.
"Perhaps some one of the family may be
found."</p>

<p>"But if he is not found?"</p>

<p>"It will be necessary to talk with her. They
are poor, evidently; the guard told me that
their rent is not paid yet. But it cannot be
that they have no blood relatives somewhere,
or at least acquaintances."</p>

<p>"Well, in every case speak of this later,"
said Augustinovich, who did not like to dwell
long on one subject.</p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted Yosef; "at least one
idea comes to my head. So far no one
has been here, and it is impossible that that
poor girl"&mdash;he indicated with his eyes the
room where the countess was sleeping&mdash;"impossible
for that poor girl to stay here
alone after his death. Tell me, is thy acquaintance,
Pani Visberg, a pious woman?"</p>

<p>"As pious as a chalice cover!"</p>

<p>"Honest, simple?"</p>

<p>"In an unheard-of degree: but what connection
has that with the countess?"</p>

<p>"I wish to place the countess in her care."</p>

<p>"But the lawsuit?"</p>

<p>"Just because of that."</p>

<p>Here the sick man moved suddenly. Yosef
looked at him quickly, then whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"One instalment of rent stands in my way,
but this and that may be arranged, perhaps
something can be done after his death."</p>

<p>"Oi, rent, rent!" whispered Augustinovich.
"To keep us awake I must tell thee a little tale.
I have never paid rent, I was enraged whenever
rent was even mentioned, and I never
could accustom any house-owner to refuse
taking it. At last I succeeded with one. He
was an old little fellow, and stupid as the ears
of Midas. Well, once I was sitting in a small
garden which belonged to him, and because
the season was summer and the time night,
for want of a better occupation I was counting
the stars in the sky. I was dreaming somewhat;
a starry night, as thou knowest, brings
a dreamy state of mind. Thereupon that ass
came to me and spoke absurdly. He simply
wanted me to pay him. I rose from my place,
and outlining in solemnity with my hand a
bow between the east and the west, I asked
mysteriously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Dost see this immensity and those millions
of the lights of God?'</p>

<p>"'I see,' answered he, frightened somewhat
by the tone of my inquiry; 'but&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Silence!' said I, in an imperious voice.
And removing my hat I raised my eyes, and
looking at the astonished man I thundered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Useless dust! compare thy five rubles&mdash;'"</p>

<p>On a sudden a suppressed groan interrupted
Augustinovich. The count had become livid,
he was twisted up, the fingers of his hands
were balled into lumps; the second attack
had come evidently.</p>

<p>At that moment Yosef rushed to the sick
man and straightened his arm almost by
force.</p>

<p>"Ys!&mdash;Bleed him!" said he in a low voice.</p>

<p>There was silence. By a wonderful chance
the lamp at that moment grew darker. From
instant to instant was heard the quick low
voice of Yosef,&mdash;</p>

<p>"His pulse? Water!"</p>

<p>"He is stifling," whispered Augustinovich.</p>

<p>Both held the breath in their breasts; the
dull sound of the lance was heard. The steel
sank in the old man's flesh, but blood did not
come.</p>

<p>"This is the end! All is useless!" said
Yosef, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>Drops of sweat came out on his forehead.</p>

<p>"He lived&mdash;he lived till he died," said
Augustinovich, with the most indifferent mien
in the world. "We have done our part, now
to sleep."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> count died really, and was buried according
to Christian ceremonial. After his death
Yosef paid a visit to the old lady. It was a
question of securing guardianship for the
countess, since no one of the family had come
forward.</p>

<p>The count had left very scanty means of
maintenance, and even if he had left more the
countess was too young to manage a house
alone.</p>

<p>Because of the lofty piety and exceeding
delicacy of conscience of Pani Visberg, it was
not difficult for Yosef to arrange the business
he had mentioned. He persuaded her that
she had killed the count by her lawsuit, and
therefore she was bound to give protection
to the daughter of her victim. The lady was
greatly terrified at the executioners of hell,
with whom Yosef threatened her, and on the
other hand she judged that the companionship
of the countess, who was of society and highly
educated as Yosef declared, would not be
without profit to Malinka.</p>

<p>Pani Visberg was an honorable woman in
the full sense of the word; she had not much
wit, it is true, and still less acquaintance with
society. The best proof of this was that she
considered Augustinovich the acme of elegance,
polish, and good tone. Yosef she
feared a little, from the time of his first visit.
But she was content in soul that such distinguished
young men, as she said, were inclined
to her lowly threshold.</p>

<p>Malinka, who in many regards resembled
her mother, was seriously smitten with Augustinovich.
She had induced the old lady to
take a permanent residence in Kieff; for that
matter Pani Visberg had come to the city
somewhat with that intent. She wished to
show her daughter to the world, for Malinka
was nineteen years of age, and during those
nineteen years she had been once in Kieff,
once in Jitomir, and had sat out the rest
of the time at home. Fortune permitted a
residence in the city. The late Pan Visberg
had been in his day an official in the customhouse,
though in a funeral speech over his
grave these words had been uttered: "Sleep,
Cleophas Visberg! for during long ages the
nations (all Europe) will admire thy integrity
and stern rectitude." We say Cleophas
Visberg left to his wife, inconsolable in
her sorrow, about nine times one hundred
thousand zlotys, and he would have left more
if inexorable Fate had not cut short his days.
He entered the kingdom of shadows more
sated with years than with income.</p>

<p>But this income fell to good hands, for both
ladies had excellent hearts. They helped
widows and orphans; they paid their servants,
male and female, regularly; they paid tithes to
their church faithfully; in a word, they performed
all Christian deeds which concern soul
and body.</p>

<p>They received the countess with open arms,
and with as much cordiality as if they had
been her relatives. Malinka, an honest though
simple maiden, was in love out and out with the
noble orphan. How much she promised herself
from the first glance to be kind and obliging
to her, how much she wished to comfort
her, how much she dreamed of a pure friendship
with her in the future, it would be difficult
to tell; enough that Yosef found as good
protection for the countess as if she had been
in the house of her own parents&mdash;it could
not have been better.</p>

<p>It is true that the countess was well fitted to
rouse sympathy. The silent and deep sorrow
which weighed her down at the moment did
not remove her so far from reality that she
could not be charming to those who were kind
to her. She thanked Yosef with tears in her
eyes; stretched to him a hand, which he,
with emotion rare in him, pressed to his lips.
"As I love God!" said Augustinovich, "I
almost wept when she looked at me. May the
devils take me if she is not a hundred times
more beautiful than I am."</p>

<p>In fact, that new figure, attended already with
words of sympathy, had connected itself with
the fate of the heroes of this book. That a
countess like her could not remain without influence
on them is understood easily. Whether
the future will attach angel wings to the shoulders
of the countess, or show in her charming
body a barren, hypocritical soul, the continuation
will teach us.</p>

<p>Hei! hei! If this life resembled a book; if
it were possible to give people souls such as
are created in thought; but then would these
be people like the rest of mankind? It would
be all one, however, for poison cakes are the
food of this world, as the boy said. The
human soul is like a spring; it carries poison
far, and what man can guarantee that poison
is not lying at the bottom of his own soul, and
that he would not create poisoned characters?
The soul is blank paper! God writes on one
side, and Satan on the other; but God and
Satan are only symbols in this case. In fact,
there is another hand; the world is that hand
really. The world writes on the soul, good
and bad people write on it, moments of happiness
write there, suffering writes more enduringly
than all. But there are souls like
mussels. The mussel changes grains of sand,
and the soul pain, into pearls; sadness and
solitude are the means. But not always. It
depends on the soul. Sadness and solitude
sometimes conceal weariness, emptiness, and
stupidity. These three full sisters like to dwell
in palaces built of sadness and solitude, seeking
that which they have never lost. It does
not follow from this that there are no charms
in solitude. Sadness has none, at least for a
sad person. Solitude for the soul is something
like a time of sleep for the body. Nay,
more; that misty monad, the soul, seems to
dissolve in solitude, to separate, to vanish, to
cease its existence almost; words and thoughts
end in that silent region; the soul is annihilated
for a season, separates on all sides from
its own centre. All this is called rest.</p>

<p>Solitude is the worst term that the human
mind has had wit to invent; solitude is never
alone, silence always goes with it.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the misty garments of this
lady called Solitude are borne most frequently
by that seductive page whose name is Laziness.</p>

<p>But sometimes, say the poets, solitude gives
a creative moment. The soul is lost then and
trembles, inclining to receive some vision flying
in from beyond.</p>

<p>For this reason only fools or sages love
solitude greatly.</p>

<p>What was the countess?</p>

<p>Let us see. It is time to descend from
cloudy heights to life's realities. Let the
countess enter! How? As a young maiden&mdash;can
there be anything more charming under
the sun? Such a beautiful mixture of blood,
body, perfumes, flowers, sun rays&mdash;and what
else?</p>

<p>Our illusions.</p>

<p>Fly in, golden butterfly.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sad</span>, indeed, had been the previous life of the
countess. During her father's life she had sat
whole days in a chamber which was lonely
and almost poor, listening to the twittering of
sparrows outside the windows, or the quarrels
of girls in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The old count came home every evening
wearied and broken with ceaseless pouring
from the empty into the void, as he called his
affairs. Nothing succeeded with him. In his
time he had been active and industrious; he
had wished to give the aristocracy an example
of how men with escutcheons should apply
themselves to labor and industry, and as a result,
he lost his property. There remained to
him in return experience which he would have
been glad to sell for a few thousand, and still
one other thing which he would not have sold,
that is, his reminiscences and his family pride.</p>

<p>In him the cement of that experience and
that pride was his hatred of life, of men, of the
whole world. This was natural. His own
people did not receive him, and those who did
receive the man, received him in such fashion
that the fable of the dying lion and the asses'
hoofs came to one's memory. If he had only
had a son! The young eagle might fly from
the nest with new strength, seeking light and
the sun&mdash;but a daughter! The old man did
not deceive himself: a daughter must become
either an old maid, or marry after his death
the first man who met her. For this reason
the count did not love his daughter as much
as he should have loved. In spite of that the
daughter loved him sincerely. She loved him
because he had white hair, because he was unfortunate,
finally, because she had no one else
to love. Moreover, he was for her the last
volume of the story which she was weaving on
in her mind.</p>

<p>Frequently in the evening her father told her
in his plaintive voice of the ancient deeds of
their family, full of glitter and glory, old histories
pleasant for counts and countesses; and
she while listening to them fixed her whole soul
in that past.</p>

<p>Often it seemed to her that from the golden
web of the legend some winged figure tore
itself free, half a hussar knight with a crooked
sabre in his grasp, an eagle-like son of the
steppe and of battle. He waved his hand, and
the steppes were cleared of Tartars. One
might say, "I can see the Crimea and the blue
waves beyond." Hei! the usual dreams of a
maiden! As wide as the steppes are, so many
are the songs of his actions; and then he is
so covered with glory, though youthful; so
bloody, though so beloved. He bent his forehead
before some female figure. The usual
dream of a magnate's daughter! That female
figure is she; he a Herburt or a Koretski.</p>

<p>And as she was reared, so did she imagine;
and these imaginings had no use, nay, they
were perhaps harmful, though attractive. So,
when the old man finished the stories, and remembering
the present, added with bitterness,
"My fault, my fault!" she wound her arms
around his neck, then, saying usually, "Not
thy fault, papa; those times will return again."</p>

<p>But those times did not return. The old
man died, and no knight appeared as a guardian,
no knight cut from the blackened background
of a picture. The form which appeared
had nothing in common with knighthood.
That head with severe face and broad forehead,
the cold face of a modern thinker, in no
manner, even in the dreams of a maiden, did
it fit to a bronze helmet with ostrich plumes.
Other powers must have pulsated in the forehead
of a man leading winged regiments
against Tartars.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, Yosef was something
entirely new for the countess, something which
made her admire. There were not many
words in him, but there was force. In a short
time he became for her everything; she found
in the man decision, energy, and swiftness of
action. Perhaps she could not explain to herself
that that also was manhood, only different
from the manhood of the past; or was she unable
to discern that? The old count succeeded
in nothing. Yosef when he had taken up her
affairs did in one day more than the count had
ever done in ten. He understood that the
countess needed some resources, so as not to
appeal in small things to the kindness and
pocket of Pani Visberg. At this thought she
trembled. He had foreseen it. He rescued
radically the remnant of her income; and his
acts in this regard were like the cut of a lancet,
ever sure, always efficient. Naturally, Yosef
managed by the aid of a jurist, an acquaintance,
who, though young, would have talked
love of God into Satan. But why did not the
old count help himself in a similar fashion?</p>

<p>This brought the countess to a certain idea:
Aristocracy she imagined to herself in the
person of her father, democracy in the person
of Yosef. "Oh, what people they must be!"
thought she, almost with dread, "terrible people
who know how to crush obstacles, another kind
of people." Books told the rest to her.</p>

<p>The countess went far in such thoughts.
Once when she asked Yosef for details concerning
his past, she heard him answer with perfect
freedom, "My father was a blacksmith." She
could hardly understand how he dared tell such
a thing, so natural did it seem to her that if
that were the case he ought not to mention it.
Why did he not conceal it? These words were
really a hammer which struck the soul of the
countess most heavily.</p>

<p>She surveyed Yosef with an astonished
glance, as if seeking a leather apron on him,
or traces of sparks on his hands. Besides, it is
proper to confess that, despite all her gratitude
to him and Pani Visberg, she judged at first,
in silence it is true, that the coronet inclined
those people to her; she judged that in sheltering
the daughter of a lord they did that somewhat
to do themselves honor. But she learned
that touching Yosef she was thoroughly mistaken.
He pronounced the word count just
as he did the word Jew, gipsy, or noble, not
even turning attention to the special sense of
those sounds.</p>

<p>Did he not understand? She could not
admit that, though really the question of aristocracy
lay thus far untouched in his mind.
She suspected him, however, of ignoring it purposely.
But that was not enough,&mdash;the countess
noticed in Yosef's treatment of her a
certain loftiness or rather indulgence. He was
considerate and kind toward her, but in such a
manner as if he wished to show that his action
was the yielding of strength before weakness,
the indulgence of a strong man for a child;
though, on the other hand, how safe she felt
under such protection!</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if there was nothing impossible
to Yosef. She could sleep quietly and
calmly; he was on guard. She tried, however,
at once to relate herself to him differently;
she wished to dazzle him with her culture.
Meanwhile it came out that Yosef corrected her
ideas gently,&mdash;showed her what was right in
them, what was erroneous. Briefly, to her
great disgust, he taught and enlightened her.
She tried to impose by her talent, and on a
certain occasion she sat down at the piano as
if by chance and displayed cascades of melody
before him; but what? That tormented Augustinovich
sat down after her and played far
better. This fellow also knew how to do everything,
he knew everything!</p>

<p>The countess went in deep thought to her
chamber that evening. But that she comprehended
and understood these relations showed
that her intelligence was not among the least,
and it was not wonderful that she thought of
these relations so soon after the death of her
father, for even the very despair of a "well-bred"
woman has in it a certain coquetry more
or less conscious, though always innocent.</p>

<p>So a silent battle had begun between a new
child of the people and an aristocratic young
lady. It was developed by those relations
which we have mentioned, relations which were
barely tangible. This struggle was the more
dangerous for him since he did not suspect it.
The countess was not able to dazzle him, but she
roused in him the most lively sympathy. For
him she became a kind of beloved child whose
fate he held in his hand, as it seemed to him.</p>

<p>Occupied with her actively, he neglected
Helena; his visits to her became rarer. He
pursued more the thought of doing something
which might be agreeable to the countess than
he fled before the thought of doing something
disagreeable to Helena.</p>

<p>As for the countess, it is easy to understand
that in her feelings for him there was not and
could not be anything which contained hate in
it. A somewhat roused vanity might lead
rather to love than to hatred. To tell the
truth, Countess Lula wished simply that that
energetic democrat might in future bend to her
aristocratic knees his submissive and enamoured
head.</p>

<p>But she had not put the object clearly till she
noticed that Yosef was a handsome man. We
will state in parenthesis that Countess Leocadia
was twenty years old, and that for some time
there had been roused in her soul various
yearnings and disquiets, of which she could not
render account to herself. In the language of
poets, that would have been called the echo of
a desire "to love and be loved, and perhaps
even to die young." But whatever the question
was, we may be satisfied by knowing that
it furnished Lula with a thread of continual
thinking of Yosef, the confidence which she
had in him. Her gratitude for protection
experienced from day to day increased her
sympathy.</p>

<p>It is true that the old countess in her time
had told Lula that a well-bred young lady
must not love; but Mother Nature whispered
to her something quite different. In truth,
those two mothers are often in disagreement.
This is one reason why in the souls of most
women a broad robust feeling rarely springs
up and becomes vigorous in them; on the
contrary, a thousand nervous little loves are
planted, less winged, but less binding.</p>

<p>Lula verified the fact, then, that Yosef was
intellectual, noble, and a handsome man; we
will not dare to guarantee which quality it was
that she emphasized most. That evening,
however, when she was going to sleep she
gave herself this question, which in the sequel
was important, "But if he loved me?"</p>

<p>Instead of an answer she ran with bare feet
and half dressed to the glass. Authors alone
are permitted to see pictures of this sort. The
night-cap was on her head, and from under
the cap came to her white shoulders tresses
of dark hair which disappeared under her
night-dress. With gleaming eyes and moving
breast she gazed at the glass. "But if he
loved me," repeated she, "and if he were
to kneel here pale and burning&mdash;" At that
moment a blood-red blush covered her face
and neck; she blew out the light.</p>

<p>Thenceforth peculiar changes began to appear
in her; sometimes a strange disquiet
mastered her, she fell into thoughtfulness;
sometimes she walked as if drowsy, as if oppressed,
weakened; at another time she covered
her head on Malinka's breast, and kissed her
without reason. Yosef she saw daily.</p>

<p>And so days and months passed; but by
degrees some change began to take place in
Yosef too. Gradually that dear child had
ripened in his soul and become a beautiful
woman in full bloom. His glance when he
looked at her had not that former complete
transparency and calmness. Formerly he
might have lulled her to sleep on his breast,
and laid her as he would a child on a couch;
to-day that would have caused a surprisingly
different sensation. The idyl grew stronger
in the spirit of both, till at last, after so many
and so many days, or so many and so many
months, the following conversations took place
in the lodgings of Pani Visberg and those of
Yosef.</p>

<p>"If thou wert in love, Malinka?"</p>

<p>"Then, my Lula, I should be very happy,
and I should love very much; and seest thou,
my Lula, the Lord God would arrange so that
the man should love me also."</p>

<p>"But if he did not love?"</p>

<p>Malinka rubbed her forehead with her hand.</p>

<p>"I do not know, I do not know, but it seems
to me that there is a difference between loving
and loving. I should love this way&mdash;O God!
I do not know how to tell it&mdash;this way is how
I should love&mdash;"</p>

<p>Malinka threw her arms around the neck of
her friend, and pressing her to her bosom,
covered her with fondling and kisses.</p>

<p>"My Lula, he would have to love me then."</p>

<p>And like two doves they hid their heads on
the breasts of each other.</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"Malinka!" said Lula at last, with tears in
her voice.</p>

<p>"Lula, my heartfelt!"</p>

<p>"Malinka, I love."</p>

<p>"I know, Lula."</p>

<hr class="hr45" />

<p>"Old man!" said Augustinovich to Yosef.</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"May I be &mdash;&mdash; if this is new. Old man,
I saw thee kissing the countess's veil. May I
be hanged if thou didst not kiss it! Well,
thou art fond of kissing&mdash;wait, I have a
parasol here, perhaps thou wilt kiss the parasol;
if that does not suit thee, then perhaps
my last year's cloak. The sleeve lining is torn,
but otherwise it is a good cloak. May I be!&mdash;Give me the pipe&mdash;I know what this
means, old man; that fool of a Visberg does
not know, but I know."</p>

<p>Yosef covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Augustinovich looked at him in silence,
shuffled his feet under the table, coughed,
muttered something through his teeth; finally
he said in a voice of emotion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old man!"</p>

<p>Yosef made no answer.</p>

<p>Augustinovich shook him by the shoulder
with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Well, old man, do not grieve, be not
troubled&mdash;thou art concerned about Helena."</p>

<p>Yosef trembled.</p>

<p>"About Helena. Thou art honest, old man.
What is to be done with her now?&mdash;I know!
If thou wish, old man, I will marry her. By
Jove, I will marry her!"</p>

<p>Yosef stood up. Beautiful resolution shone
on his broad forehead, and though on his
frowning brows thou couldst read pain and
struggle, thou couldst see that the victory
would fall where Yosef wished it. He pressed
Augustinovich's hand.</p>

<p>"I am going out."</p>

<p>"Where art thou going?"</p>

<p>"To Helena."</p>

<p>Augustinovich stared at him.</p>

<p>"To He-le-na?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Yosef. "Enough of deceit
and hesitation! To Helena with a request
for her hand."</p>

<p>Augustinovich looked at him as he went out,
and shaking his head, muttered through his
teeth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"See, stupid Adasia,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> how people act."</p>

<p>Then he filled his pipe, turned on the bed,
and snored with redoubled energy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Adasia is Adam, Augustinovich's own name.</div>



<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Helena</span> was not at home. Yosef waited several
hours for her, walking unquietly up and
down in her chamber. He resolved at whatever
cost to come out of the false position in
which he had been put by his guardianship
over the widow and over the countess, but he
acknowledged to himself that this resolution
brought him pain. That pain was great, almost
physical. Yosef had come to ask Helena's
hand, but it seemed to him at that moment
that he could not endure her. He was rushing
toward the other with heart and mind; thou
wouldst have said that he felt a prayer in his
own breast, that he begged of his own will for
a moment more of that other. He loved Lula
as only energetic natures can love who are apparently
cold.</p>

<p>He prepared himself for the meeting with
Helena, and he foresaw that it would cost him
no little. There is nothing more repulsive
than to tell a woman who is not loved that she
is loved. That is one of the least possible
hypocrisies for a real manly nature. Yosef on
a time had loved Helena, but he had ceased to
love her, even before he had observed how
and how much he had become attached to
Lula. When he saw this he had a moment of
weakness; he felt this new love, and he feared
to think of it and confess it. When his heart
spoke too loudly, he said to it: "Be silent!"
And he closed his ears, fearing his own possible
actions and especially decisions for the
future. This was not in accordance with him,
and could not last long.</p>

<p>Augustinovich with his peculiar cynicism
cast this love in his eyes, and forced him to
meet it face to face. Further evasion was
now impossible. Yosef stood up to the battle,
and went from it to Helena.</p>

<p>But he did not go without traces of a struggle.
He had a fever in his blood, and he could
not think calmly. Various pictures of small
but dear memories came to his mind, wherewith
at that moment he believed more than
ever that Lula loved him.</p>

<p>"Have I the right to destroy her happiness
too?" This imbecile thought roared in him
like the last arrow of conquered warriors. He
broke it, however, with the reflection that between
him and Helena there was an obligation,
between him and Lula nothing.</p>

<p>Other difficulties belonged to the result of
Yosef's decision. The decision was honest,
but still to turn it into reality he had to lie,
and then to lie all his life by pretending love.
Evil appeared as a result of good. "Ei, shall
I not have to go mad?" thought he. "And
this life will be snarled like a thread. Every one
is whirling round after happiness, as a dog after
his own tail, and every man is chasing it with
equal success." Ho! Yosef, who did not love
declamation, had still fallen into the dialectics
of unhappiness. Such a philosophy has a
charm: a man loves his misfortune as a happiness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile evening came, but Helena was
not to be seen. Yosef supposed that she must
have gone to the cemetery, and he did not
himself know why that thought made him angry
on that occasion.</p>

<p>He lighted a candle and began to walk
through the room. By chance his glance fell
on Potkanski. Yosef had not known him, and
did not like him, though for the justification of
his antipathy he could hardly bring in the
words "lord's son."</p>

<p>When he looked again at that broad, calm
face, something glittered in his eyes which was
almost like hatred.</p>

<p>"And for her I am only the counterfeit of
that man there," thought he.</p>

<p>These words were not true, Yosef differed
altogether in character from Potkanski, and
Helena loved him now for himself; nevertheless
the thought pricked him, he would have
given much if Helena had not on a time been
the wife of that man there, and had not had a
child by him. "And I shall have a child,"
said he, "a son whom I shall rear into a man,
strong and practical."</p>

<p>"Ah, if that future child were mine and
Lula's!"</p>

<p>He shook feverishly and pressed his lips; a
few drops of perspiration glittered on his forehead.
In the last thought there was a whole
ocean of desire.</p>

<p>He sat in that way for half an hour yet before
Helena came. She was dressed in black,
with which color her pale complexion and
blond hair came out excellently. When she
saw Yosef she smiled timidly; but great pleasure
was in that smile, for he had been a rare
guest in recent times.</p>

<p>Happily for her, she had enough of tact or
of feminine foresight not to reproach him; she
did not dare, either, to rejoice aloud at his coming,
since she knew not what he was bringing.
But the palm which she gave him embraced
his hand firmly and broadly. That palm quivered
with the heartfelt language of movements
interpreting fear and feeling when lips are
silent.</p>

<p>With a melancholy smile and hand so extended
she was enchanting with the inexpressible
charm of an enamoured woman. If she
had had a star in her hair, she might have
passed simply for an angel,&mdash;perhaps she had
even the aureole around her head which love
gives,&mdash;but for Yosef she was not an angel,
nor had she an aureole; but he touched her
hand with his lips.</p>

<p>"Be seated, Helena, near me, and listen,"
said he. "I have not been here for a long
time, and I wish that the former freedom and
confidence should return to us."</p>

<p>She threw aside her cape and hat, arranged
her hair with her hand, and sat down in silence.
Great alarm was evident on her face.</p>

<p>"I hear thee, Yosef."</p>

<p>"It is four years since the death of Gustav,
who confided thee to me. I have kept the
promise given him as well as I was able, and
as I knew how, but the relation between us
has not been such as it should be. This must
change, Helena."</p>

<p>He needed to draw breath, he had to pronounce
sentence on himself.</p>

<p>In the silence which lasted awhile, the beating
of Helena's heart could be heard. Her
face was pale, her eyes blinked quickly, as is
usual with women who are frightened.</p>

<p>"Must they change?" whispered she, in a
scarcely audible voice.</p>

<p>"Be my wife."</p>

<p>"Yosef!"</p>

<p>She placed her hands together, as if for
prayer, and looked at him a moment with
eyes wandering because of pressing thoughts
and feelings.</p>

<p>"Be my wife. The time of which I spoke
to thee before has come."</p>

<p>She threw her arms around his neck, and
put her head on his breast.</p>

<p>"Thou art not trifling with me, Yosef? No,
no! Then I shall be happy yet? Oh, I love
thee so!"</p>

<p>Helena's bosom rose and fell, her face was
radiant, and her lips approached his.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have been very sad, very lonely," continued
she, "but I believed in thee. The heart
trusts when it loves. Thou art mine! I only
live through thee&mdash;what is life? If one laughs
and is joyful, if one is sad and weeps, if one
thinks and loves&mdash;that is life. But I rejoice
and I weep only through thee, I think of thee,
I love thee. If people wished to divide us I
should tear out my hair and bind thy feet with
it. I am like a flame which thou mayst blow. I
am thine&mdash;let me weep! Dost thou love me?"</p>

<p>"I love."</p>

<p>"I have wept for so many years, but not
such tears as I shed to-day. It is so bright in
my soul! Let me close my eyes and look at
that brightness. How much happiness in one
word! Oh, Yosef, my Yosef, I know not even
how to think of this."</p>

<p>It was grievous for him to hear words like
those from Helena; he felt the immense falsehood
and discord in which his life had to flow
with that woman thenceforward, that woman so
beautiful, so greatly loving, and loved so little.</p>

<p>He rose and took farewell of her.</p>

<p>Helena, left alone, placed her burning forehead
against a pane of the window, and long
did she stand thus in silence. At last she
opened the window, and, placing her head on
her palm, looked into the broad, sparkling
summer night. Silent tears flowed down her
face, her golden tresses fell upon her bosom,
the moonlight was moving upon her forehead
and putting a silvery whiteness on her dress.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A few</span> days later Augustinovich was sitting in
Yosef's lodgings; he was working vigorously in
view of the approaching examination. Loving
effect in all things, he had shaded the windows,
and in the middle of the room had placed a
table, before which he was standing at that
moment. Evidently he was occupied with
some experiment, for on the table was a
multitude of old glass vessels and pots full
of powders and fluids, and in the centre was
burning a spirit lamp, which surrounded with
a blue flame the stupid head of a retort which
was quivering under the influence of boiling
liquid contained in it.</p>

<p>Work burned, as they said, in the hands of
Augustinovich; no one could labor so quickly
as he. With a glad smile on his face he moved
really with enthusiasm, frequently entertaining
himself with a song or a dialogue with the first
vessel he took up, or with a pious remark on
the fleeting nature of this world.</p>

<p>Sometimes he left his work for a moment,
and raising his eyes and his hands declaimed
in tones which were very tragic,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"Ah, Eurydice! before thy beauty</p>
<p>I passed the rounds of success,</p>
<p>And the sentence of Delphi was undoubted,</p>
<p>That on earth I am the only one blest."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then again in a hundred trills and cadences he
sang,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry">"O piano! piano!&mdash;Zitto! pia-ha-ha-no!"</p>

<p class="noindent">Or similar creations of his own mind on a
sudden,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"And if thou fill a pipe, O Youth,</p>
<p>And pressing the bowl with thy finger, put fire on it."</p>
</div>

<p>"By Mohammed! If Yosef should come,
this work would go on more quickly; but he is
marrying Helena at present&mdash;Ei! and as innocence
is dear to me, I would fix it this way!
Dear Helena, permit&mdash;And what farther? Oh,
the farther the better&mdash;"</p>

<p>All at once some one pulled the bell.</p>

<p>Augustinovich turned toward the door and
extending his hand intoned,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"Road-weary traveller,</p>
<p>Cross thou my threshold."</p>
</div>

<p>The door opened; a man young and elegantly
dressed entered the room.</p>

<p>Augustinovich did not know him.</p>

<p>The most important notable trait of the
newly arrived was a velvet sack-coat and light-colored
trousers; besides, he was washed,
shaven, and combed. His face was neither
stupid nor clever, neither beautiful nor ugly,
neither kind nor malicious, moreover he was
neither tall nor of low stature. His nose,
mouth, chin, and forehead were medium;
special marks he had none.</p>

<p>"Does Pan Yosef Shvarts live here?"</p>

<p>"It is certain that he lives here."</p>

<p>"Is it possible to see him?"</p>

<p>"It is possible at this time; but in the night,
when it is very dark, the case is different."</p>

<p>The newly arrived began to lose patience;
but Augustinovich's face expressed rather
gladness than malice.</p>

<p>"The owner of this house sent me to Pan
Yosef as to a man who knows the address and
the fate of Countess Leocadia N&mdash;&mdash;. Could
you give me some explanations as to her?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she is very nice!"</p>

<p>"That is not the question."</p>

<p>"Just that, indeed. Were I to answer that
she is as ugly as night, would you be curious
to make her acquaintance? No, no, by the
prophet!"</p>

<p>"My name is Pelski; I am her cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not her cousin at all!"</p>

<p>The newly arrived frowned.</p>

<p>"Either you do not understand me, or you
are trifling."</p>

<p>"Not at all, though Pani Visberg always
insists that I am&mdash;But you are not acquainted
with Pani Visberg. She is an excellent
woman. She is distinguished by this,
that she has a daughter, though it is nothing
great to have a daughter; but she is as rich
as Jupiter!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Now I hear steps on the stairs,&mdash;Pan
Yosef is coming surely. I will lay a wager
with you that he is coming&mdash;"</p>

<p>Indeed, the door opened and Yosef walked
in. One would have said that his severe and
intelligent face had matured in the last few
hours; in its expression was the calm energy
of a man who had already decided on the
means of advance in the future.</p>

<p>"This is Pan Pelski, Yosef," said Augustinovich.</p>

<p>Yosef looked at the newly arrived inquiringly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pelski explained to him the object
of his coming; and though at news of the
relationship of the young man to Lula his
forehead wrinkled slightly, he gave him her
address without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I take farewell of you," said Yosef, at last;
"the countess will be greatly delighted to find
in you a cousin, but it is a pity that she could
not have found a relative two months ago."</p>

<p>Pelski muttered something unintelligible.
Evidently Yosef's figure and style of intercourse
imposed on him no little.</p>

<p>"Why give him Lula's address?" asked
Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"Because I should have acted ridiculously
had I refused."</p>

<p>"But I did not give it."</p>

<p>"What didst thou tell him?"</p>

<p>"A thousand things except the address. I
did not know whether thou wouldst be satisfied
if I gave it."</p>

<p>"He would have found the address anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be pleasant at Pani Visberg's.
Wilt thou go there to-day?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But when?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"It is no trick, old man, to flee before
danger."</p>

<p>"I am no knight errant, I am not Don
Quixote, I choose rather to avoid dangers and
conquer than choose them and fall. Not
Middle-Age boasting commands me, but
reason."</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed.</p>

<p>"Wert thou at Helena's yesterday?" asked
Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"When will the marriage be?"</p>

<p>"Right away after I receive my degree."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is better for thee that the affair
ends thus."</p>

<p>"Why dost thou say that?"</p>

<p>"I do not know but thou wilt be angry; but
Lula&mdash;now, I do not believe her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yosef's eyes gleamed with a wonderful
light; he put his hand on Augustinovich's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Say nothing bad of her," said he, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>He wished, indeed, that the countess, torn
from him by the force of circumstances, should
remain in his mind unblemished. He took
pleasure in thinking of her.</p>

<p>"What am I to tell her when she asks about
thee?" inquired Augustinovich, after a short
silence.</p>

<p>"Tell her the truth, tell her that I am going
to marry another."</p>

<p>"Ei, old man, I will tell her something else."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Yosef, looking him in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, so!"</p>

<p>"Speak clearly."</p>

<p>"She seems to love thee."</p>

<p>Yosef's face flushed; he knew Lula's feeling,
but that information from the lips of
another startled him. It filled his breast with
sweetness and as it were with despair together
with the sweetness.</p>

<p>"Who told thee that?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Malinka; she tells me everything."</p>

<p>"Then tell Lula that I marry another from
inclination and duty."</p>

<p>"Amen!" concluded Augustinovich.</p>

<hr class="inv" />

<p>In the evening he went to Pani Visberg's;
Malinka opened the door to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, is this you?" said she, with a blush.</p>

<p>Augustinovich seized her hands and kissed
them repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pan Adam! that is not permitted, not
permitted," insisted the blushing girl.</p>

<p>"It is, it is!" answered he, in a tone of deep
conviction. "But&mdash;but," continued he, removing
his overcoat and buttoning his gloves (he
was dressed with uncommon elegance), "was
some young man here this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"He was; he will come in the evening."</p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>Augustinovich went into the drawing-room
with Malinka. The drawing-room had somehow
a look of importance, as if for the reception
of a notable guest. On the table a double
lamp was burning, the piano was open.</p>

<p>"Why did Pan Yosef not come with
you?"</p>

<p>"The same question from the countess will
meet me. In every case permit me to defer
my answer till she asks."</p>

<p>The countess did not keep them waiting
long. She entered, dressed in black, with
simply a few pearls in her hair.</p>

<p>"But Pan Yosef?" asked she at once.</p>

<p>"He is not coming."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He is occupied. Building his future."</p>

<p>The countess was wounded by the thought
that Yosef would not come.</p>

<p>"But do you not help him in that labor?"
asked she.</p>

<p>"May my guardian angel keep me from such
work."</p>

<p>"It must be very difficult."</p>

<p>"Like every new building."</p>

<p>"Why does he work so?"</p>

<p>"Duty."</p>

<p>"I believe that Pan Yosef builds everything
on that foundation."</p>

<p>"This time it will be more difficult for him
than ever before. But somebody is coming&mdash;that
is your cousin. What a splendid
man!"</p>

<p>Pan Pelski entered the drawing-room; soon
after came Pani Visberg also.</p>

<p>After the greetings conversation began to
circle about in the ocean of commonplace.</p>

<p>Augustinovich took little part in it. He sat
in an armchair, partly closed his eyes with an
expression of indifference toward everything.
He had the habit of closing his eyes while
making observations, when nothing escaped
his notice.</p>

<p>Count Pelski (we had forgotten to state that
he had that title) sat near Lula, twirling in his
fingers the string of his eyeglasses, and conversing
with her vivaciously.</p>

<p>"Till I came to Kieff," said he, "I knew
nothing of the misfortune which had met our
whole family, but especially you, through the
death of your esteemed father."</p>

<p>"Did you know my father?" asked Lula,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"No, cousin. I knew only that unfortunate
quarrels and lawsuits separated our families
for a number of years. I knew nothing of
those quarrels, since I was young and always
absent, and if I am to make a confession my
present visit was undertaken only as an attempt
at reconciliation."</p>

<p>"What was the degree of relationship between
you and my father?"</p>

<p>"Reared abroad, I know little of our family
relations in general; for example, I am indebted
to a lucky chance for discovering not
our relationship, of which I was aware, but
other intimate bonds connecting our families
from of old."</p>

<p>"Is it permitted to inquire about this circumstance?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, cousin. Having taken on
me, after the death of my father, the management
of my property and family affairs, I
looked into the papers and various documents
touching my family. Well, in these documents
I discovered that your family is not
only related to the Pelskis, but has the same
escutcheon."</p>

<p>"To a certain extent, then, we are to thank
chance for our acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I bless this chance, cousin."</p>

<p>Lula dropped her eyes, her small hand
twisted the end of her scarf; after a while she
raised her head.</p>

<p>"And for me it is equally pleasant," said
she.</p>

<p>The shadow of a smile flew over Augustinovich's
face.</p>

<p>"I had much difficulty in finding your
lodgings. This gentleman" (Pelski indicated
Augustinovich with one eye) "has a marvellous
method of giving answers. Fortunately his
room-mate came; he gave me an answer at
last."</p>

<p>"I lived in the same house as they," added
the countess.</p>

<p>"How did you become acquainted with
them, cousin?"</p>

<p>"When father fell ill, Pan Shvarts watched
him in his last hours; afterward he found Pani
Visberg, and I am much indebted to him."</p>

<p>Augustinovich's closed eyelids opened a
little, and the sneering expression vanished
from his face.</p>

<p>"Is he a doctor?" asked Pelski.</p>

<p>"He will be a doctor soon."</p>

<p>Pelski meditated a moment.</p>

<p>"I was acquainted in Heidelberg with a
professor and writer of the same name. From
what family is this man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not know, indeed," answered the
countess, blushing deeply.</p>

<p>Augustinovich's eyes opened to their full
width, and with an indescribable expression of
malice he turned toward the countess.</p>

<p>"I thought," said he, "that you knew perfectly
whence Pan Yosef came, and what his
family is."</p>

<p>Lula's confusion reached the highest degree.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do not remember," groaned she.</p>

<p>"Do you not? Then I will remind you.
Pan Yosef was born in Zvinogrodets, where
his father in his day was a blacksmith."</p>

<p>Pelski looked at his cousin, and bending
toward her said with sympathy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am pained, cousin, at the fatality which
forced you to live with people of a different
sphere."</p>

<p>Lula sighed.</p>

<p>Oh, evil, evil was that sigh. Lula knew
that among those people of a different sphere
she had found aid, protection, and kindness;
that for this reason they should be for her
something more than that cousin of recent
acquaintance. But she was ashamed to tell
him this, and she remained silent, a little angry
and a little grieved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pani Visberg invited her guests
to tea. Lula ran for a while to her own chamber,
and sitting on her bed covered her face
with her hands. At that moment she was in
Yosef's chamber mentally. "He is toiling
there," thought she, "and here they speak of
him as of some one strange to me. Why did
that other say that he was the son of a
blacksmith?"</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if they were wronging
Yosef, but she felt offended at him, too, because
he was the son of a blacksmith.</p>

<p>At tea she sat near her cousin, a little
thoughtful, a little sad, turning unquiet glances
toward Augustinovich, who from the moment
of his malicious interference filled her with a
certain fear.</p>

<p>"Indeed thou art not thyself, Lula," said
Pani Visberg, placing her hand on the girl's
heated forehead.</p>

<p>Malinka, who was standing with the teapot
in her hand, pouring tea in the light, stopped
the yellowish stream, and turning her head
said with a smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lula is only serious. I find thee, Lula, in
black colors&mdash;art thou in love?"</p>

<p>The countess understood Malinka's idea,
but she was not confused.</p>

<p>"Black is the color of mourning; in every
case it is my color."</p>

<p>"And beautiful as thy word, cousin," added
Pelski.</p>

<p>After tea she seated herself at the piano, and
from behind the music-rack could be seen her
shapely forehead marked with regular brows.
She played a certain melancholy mazurka of
Chopin, but trouble and disquiet did not leave
her face.</p>

<p>Augustinovich knew music, and from her
playing he divined the condition of her mind.
Still he thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is sad, therefore she plays; but she
plays because her cousin is listening."</p>

<p>But on the way home he thought more
about Lula and Yosef than one might have
expected from his frivolous nature.</p>

<p>"Oh, Satan take it, what will happen, what
will happen?" muttered he.</p>

<p>In the midst of these thoughts he entered
his lodgings. Yosef was not sleeping yet; he
was sitting leaning on his elbows over some
book.</p>

<p>"Hast thou been at Pani Visberg's?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>Impatience and curiosity were quivering in
Yosef's face; evidently he wished to ask about
the evening, but on thinking the matter over
he rested his head on his hands again, and
began to read.</p>

<p>Suddenly he threw the book aside and
walked a couple of times through the room.</p>

<p>"Thou wert at Pani Visberg's?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>He sat down to his book again.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A couple</span> of weeks passed. The relations
of the personages known to us had not undergone
change.</p>

<p>Yosef did not visit Pani Visberg's, but, to
make up, Pelski was a daily guest there in spite
of Augustinovich, who tormented him, and
whom the count could not endure.</p>

<p>"How does the countess's cousin seem to
thee?" asked Yosef of him one day.</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend, he is a zero."</p>

<p>"With what dost thou reproach him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; what does stupidity mean really?
He talks with the ladies as far as he is able; he
wears a fashionable coat, glossy gloves; he
knots his cravat symmetrically, praises virtue,
condemns vice, says it is better to be wise
than not; still, O Yosef, he is a zero."</p>

<p>"Thou judgest people in masses."</p>

<p>"Again! in masses. As is known to thee,
I judge the breast according to the measure
of the tailor, not that of Phidias; and as I advance
laughter seizes me, but my heart does
not burst, it must have cause sufficient to
burst."</p>

<p>"Speak more clearly."</p>

<p>"What shall I say to thee? Well, he is a
middling man, a man of the mean, but not
the golden one; honest, for he has not done
anything dishonest or perverse. But let him
go! Better speak of philosophy or sing an
old contradance; which dost thou prefer?"</p>

<p>"Let us speak of him, I beg of thee," said
Yosef, with decision.</p>

<p>"Well, fill me a pipe then."</p>

<p>Yosef filled a pipe for him, lighted a cigar for
himself, and began to walk through the room.</p>

<p>"I will not give thee an account of the evenings
there, for I do not wish to annoy thee,"
said Augustinovich, "but if thou desire this
thing, then listen.</p>

<p>"The affair is as follows: Pelski learned that
the old count left a daughter, and curiosity
led him to look at her. Seest thou, people
are vain; they love effect, and the rle of a
rich cousin in presence of a poor one is
not devoid of effect, so this rle has pleased
Pelski. Whom would it not please? Thou art
wealthy, and givest thy hand to her (that is,
to thy cousin), thou shieldest her with thy
most mighty protection, astonishest her with
thy delicacy of feeling, with thy acts; thou
becomest her king's son&mdash;her ideal. Ei, old
man, how this tickles vanity! What romances
these are, Satan take me!</p>

<p class="poetry">'O gray rye, he is digging the earth!'</p>

<p class="noindent">It is a whole novel. A steed, a noble figure,
on her part smiles and tears&mdash;they are
separated by fate; later they meet, they
agree, they are reconciled, and Numa marries
Pompilius!"</p>

<p>These last words Augustinovich pronounced
with a certain maliciousness.</p>

<p>"Art thou speaking of Lula and Pelski?"
asked Yosef, gloomily.</p>

<p>"Yes; Pelski looked at her through curiosity,
and she, as thou knowest, is a fair
maiden, and that rle pleased him. Pelski is
an ordinary man, an aristocrat,&mdash;in one word,
zero,&mdash;but if she pays no attention to the
statue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, if?" interrupted Yosef, catching at
the last word.</p>

<p>"But thou&mdash;why deceive thyself? It must
be all one to thee. Thou art not a child nor
a woman; thou hadst full knowledge of what
thou wert doing when going to Helena with
a declaration."</p>

<p>Yosef was silent; Augustinovich continued:
"I say: Pelski is a young man and wealthy,
she pleases him very much, and she may not
look at the statue; she pleases him,&mdash;that is
the main thing."</p>

<p>"Let us suppose that she will not consider
the statue, what further?"</p>

<p>"In that case Lula will become Countess
Pelski."</p>

<p>"Will she consent? What sayst thou?"</p>

<p>Yosef's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Listen, old man, I say this: I know not
the good of this conversation. Perhaps she
might not consent to-day, but in half a year
or a year she will consent. If thou wert there
thou mightest contend with him; otherwise, I
repeat, she will consent."</p>

<p>"On what dost thou rest that judgment?"</p>

<p>"On what? A certain evening when I saw
Pelski I was listening, and he asked, 'Of what
family is Shvarts?' and she answered, 'I know
not, really.' Thou seest! But when I said
that thou art the son of a blacksmith, she was
in flames, and almost burst into weeping from
anger at me. There it is for thee!"</p>

<p>Yosef also felt at that moment as it were
a wish to weep from anger.</p>

<p>"Seest thou," continued Augustinovich,
"Pelski unconsciously and unwittingly acts
with great success; he brings her mind to
ancient titles and brilliant relations; he cannot
even do otherwise. And she is an aristocrat
in every case. Thou rememberest how on
a time that angered me and thee, and how
much thou didst labor to shatter those principles
in her. By the crocodile! there is nothing
haughtier than proud poverty. Pelski acts
wisely, he flatters her vanity, he rouses her
self-love; that removes her from us. But we,
my old man, are such counts as, without comparing&mdash;Oh,
Satan take it! I cannot find
here comparisons."</p>

<p>In fact, he did not find comparisons, and for
want of them he fell to puffing out strong
rings of smoke, and trying diligently to catch
some of them on his fingers. Meanwhile
Yosef looked stubbornly at one point in the
ceiling, and asked at last,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didst tell her that I was going to marry
Helena?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I said that thou wert toiling, and for that
reason did not appear. Let the affair between
thee and Pelski be decided in her mind, in her
conscience and heart. Thy marriage is an
external event which would decide the matter
definitely on his side."</p>

<p>Yosef approached Augustinovich and fixed
his fingers in his arm.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said he, violently; "but if I
should win in this battle?"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil! and do not pinch me so
hard. I throw the same question at thee: If
thou shouldst win in this battle?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other, eye to eye; some
kind of hostile feeling pressed their hearts.</p>

<p>At last Yosef dropped Augustinovich's arm,
and hiding his face in his hands threw himself
on the bed.</p>

<p>Augustinovich looked at him threateningly,
then less threateningly, and still less threateningly;
finally he pushed down to him and
stroked him with his hand. He drew him by
the skirt, and his voice now was soft and full
of emotion.</p>

<p>"Old man!"</p>

<p>Yosef did not answer.</p>

<p>"My old man, be not angry. If thou win
thou wilt preserve her in thy heart as a saint,
and I will say to her: Go, bright angel, along
the path of duty, as Yosef went."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Helena</span> hardly believed her own happiness.
She was preparing for her marriage. Her
clouded past had vanished, life's night was
over, the morning was shining.</p>

<p>From a woman of a wandering star, who
knew not where and how low she might fall,
from a woman who was a beggar, from a
woman without a morrow, to enter into a new
period of life, to receive the affection of a man
whom she loved, to become in the future a
wife, to begin a calm life, a life which had a
to-morrow, surrounded by respect, filled with
love and duty,&mdash;that was her future.</p>

<p>Helena understood, or rather had a prescience
of the abnormal relation between her
past and her future. "From such a life as
mine that ought not to come. I am not worthy
of this happiness," whispered she to Yosef,
when he placed the ring of betrothal on her
finger. "I am not worthy of such happiness."</p>

<p>That half-insane woman possessed of love
was right. Out of the logic of life such a
future could not bloom, but her life had
ceased already to move in its own proper
orbit.</p>

<p>There are stars which circle in solitude along
undefined orbits, till swept away by more
powerful planets they go farther, either around
them or with them.</p>

<p>Something similar had happened to Helena.</p>

<p>A stronger will had attracted a weaker.
Helena met Yosef on her track, and thenceforward
she travelled in his course.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this made her more
peaceful. "Oh, if he wishes I shall be
happy," thought she, more than once.</p>

<p>She had unbounded belief, not only in
Yosef's character, but in his strength. So the
last shadow vanished from her soul; alarm
disappeared, that indefinite fear of the future
which she could not dismiss till the moment
of Yosef's declaration, this fear which tortured
her like a reproach of conscience.</p>

<p>Her head was full of imaginings. With a
song on her lips she made preparations for
marriage, amusing herself like a child with
every detail of dress. Notwithstanding her
widowhood she wished to wear a white dress,
which would also please Yosef. Regaining
cheerfulness, she regained her health also;
she was busy, active, even minutely painstaking
with reference to future housekeeping.</p>

<p>She grew more beautiful and more noble-looking
under the influence of happiness.
From being a misanthropic woman, a bird
with plucked wings, she was changing into
a woman who felt her own worth, even in
this, that some one loved her.</p>

<p>The date of the marriage was approaching.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the time in which Yosef was to
become a doctor was drawing near. He toiled,
therefore, and toiled so intensely that his health
tottered. Sleepless nights and mental effort
marked his face with pallor; he grew thin,
blue under the eyes; he lived in continual
feverish labor, in reality he was losing his
strength, but he kept on his feet as best he
could, wishing at any price to win absolutely
both position and an independent future.</p>

<p>Besides ambition and the approaching date
of his marriage, one other thing urged him
to those efforts: the supply of money which
he had brought from home had been gradually
diminishing, and at present was almost exhausted.
Now the burden of expenses and
housekeeping fell on Augustinovich. Augustinovich
had given up drinking and earned
more than Yosef. Music lessons brought him
in very much relatively, and he did not need
to renounce them because of the pressure of
other work, for with him natural gifts took the
place of time and toil, even more than was
needed.</p>

<p>He went to Pani Visberg's daily, as before.
Malinka ran out every evening to open the
door to him, and every evening she snatched
away her hands, which he had the habit of
covering with numerous kisses. The honest
girl grew attached to Pan Adam. Did he
love her? Rather no than yes, for the past
had quenched in him the powers of sympathy.
In reality he had not fire to the value of a
copper. If passion had given heat to his
powers, they would have carried him far, but
the light from them was like moonlight, it
gave light without heat.</p>

<p>That, however, did not hinder him from
being, as they say, a capital fellow, a perfect
comrade, and a pleasant companion. If he
felt any attachment, it was for Yosef. But he
had his likes and dislikes; he liked Malinka,
but he did not like Lula.</p>

<p>And why did he not like her? There were
various reasons. She met him always with
cool loftiness, and besides she was a countess.
Usually he had success with women; he owed
it to his inexhaustible joyousness, and even to
his cynicism, which made him as if at home
everywhere. He had, moreover, a most particular
power of adapting himself to that
society in which he chanced to be. Never
refined, he possessed (when he wished) high
social polish. He used to say of himself that
in him ease of distinction was inherited, since
it came "from worthy blood." He had never
known his parents, it is true, nor known who
they were. He had the hypothesis, even, that,
according to the well-known jest, Letitia the
grandmother of Napoleon III. and his grandmother
were grandmothers; he proved in this
way his relationship with the Buonapartes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these characteristics, Lula
ignored him somewhat. Yosef's solid, simple
character roused a deeper interest in her than
the frivolous, elastic nature of Augustinovich.
Besides, she loved Yosef. So, by the nature of
things, Augustinovich remained at one side.
That annoyed him. This was the state of
things when Pelski appeared. Especially from
the time when Yosef ceased to pay visits, Lula
had changed uncommonly. Augustinovich annoyed
her, for he judged things through the
prism of his particular repugnance to her. He
thought that then, if ever, she would show
him dislike and even contempt; meanwhile it
came out otherwise. Lula left her rle of indifference
and began to fear him.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the gods," thought Augustinovich,
"a man's tongue is nimble enough, it
seems. She is afraid that I shall make a fool
of Pelski."</p>

<p>In fact, something of the kind happened a
number of times,&mdash;a thing which it must be
confessed touched Lula very disagreeably.</p>

<p>At first Lula asked, time after time, about
Yosef, but received the same answer always,
"He is working." At last she ceased asking.
Still it seemed that she wished to win over
Augustinovich. In her treatment of him there
was now a certain mildness joined with a silent
melancholy. Often she followed him uneasily
with her eyes when he came in, as if waiting
for some news.</p>

<p>This alarm was natural. Whether she loved
Yosef or not, it could not but astonish her that
he on whom she had counted so much, who
had shown her so much sympathy always, had
now forgotten her. She could not rest satisfied,
either, with the answers of Augustinovich.</p>

<p>In spite of the greatest labor it was impossible
that Yosef should not find in the course
of more than two months one moment of time,
even, to look in at her, to inquire about her
health, all the more since she knew that he
loved her. In this thought the coming of
Pelski was connected in her mind wonderfully
with the absence of Yosef. She supposed,
justly, that there was a certain connection between
them. Augustinovich alone could explain
these things, but he did not wish to do so.</p>

<p>Alarmed, then irritated and troubled, attracted
by Pelski to regions of brilliant
dreams, and a splendid future of wealth, comfort,
servants, and carriages, on the one side,
on the other she rushed in mind to the modest
lodgings of Yosef, inquiring anxiously why he
did not come.</p>

<p>But he did not come. Pelski appeared
every day more definitely as a rival. Lula,
blaming Yosef for indifference, annoyed and
humiliated by this, was willing, even through
revenge, to give her hand to Pelski. Moreover,
tradition attracted her in that direction.
Who had the power, who ought to gain the
victory, it was easy to foresee.</p>

<p>Pelski, in so far as he was able, strove to
scatter the clouds from Lula's forehead, and
frequently he succeeded in doing so. From
time to time Lula had wonderful accesses of
joyousness. She laughed then, and scattered
more or less witty words by thousands; and
though there was a kind of fever in this gladness,
there was no little coquetry also. Her
eyes flashed on such occasions, from her temples
there was a burning atmosphere. Her
lips played with an alluring smile; her words
wounded and fondled, attracted and repulsed
in turn. Pelski generally, and after a few unfortunate
trials with Augustinovich, Pelski
alone, fell a victim to these freaks. He lost
his head then, and from the rle of cousin protector
he passed to that of a cousin captive.</p>

<p>And the more humble he became, the more
insolent grew Lula; the sadder he was, the
gladder was she.</p>

<p>"Panna Malinka," whispered Augustinovich,
on such occasions, "never be like her; she is a
coquette."</p>

<p>"She is not," answered Malinka, sadly. "I
will remind you of these words."</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what Augustinovich
would have thought after such an evening, had
he seen that woman, who a moment before was
coquettish, left alone in her chamber, where
she sobbed so that long, long hours could not
quiet her.</p>

<p>The poor girl, she could not even confess
her suffering to any one, and the grievous battle
which she was fighting all alone with herself.
She wept in moments of weakness. How
much wounded self-love was there in those
tears, how much sincere love for Yosef, it is
difficult to tell. Formerly she would have put
her arms around the neck of the kind Malinka,
and confessed all that oppressed her soul, but
now even Malinka was a stranger to her, or at
least was not so near as formerly. Just those
unsuccessful attempts to coquet with Augustinovich
had wounded deeply that maiden, who
was in love with him; and besides the relations
of Lula with Pelski seemed very odd to her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile time passed. Lula began to doubt
whether Yosef had ever loved her. Pelski
imperceptibly fed her with the thought of future
comfort. Time flowed on, and Time, according
to the words of the poet, "is the odious guardian
of blooming roses."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Malinka</span> tried frequently to learn of Augustinovich
the real cause of Yosef's absence.</p>

<p>"Why bind her hands?" asked she, speaking
of Lula.</p>

<p>Augustinovich assured her that he did not
wish to bind Lula's hands, but afterward he
was silent or lied.</p>

<p>On the other hand Yosef was convinced that
the countess knew everything.</p>

<p>"I told her everything," said Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"But she? Do not hide from me!"</p>

<p>"Yosef?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What is that to thee?"</p>

<p>Yosef gritted his teeth, but inquired no
further. He was ashamed. He confessed to
himself that those questions were an indulgence
granted to weakness and to a former feeling.
With consternation almost he saw that time
had brought no relief. Oh, there were moments
when he wished to cast away Helena and duty
and conscience and go and sell even honor,
even the remnant of self-respect, for one
moment in which he could rest his head
against the countess' shoulder. And he could
not help meditating about her. So far he
had conquered, but now he remembered that
formerly he had been different from what he
was then.</p>

<p>Formerly his character had that calm depth
which concealed everything; to-day he boiled
up. From passionate outbursts he passed frequently
to melancholy and indifferent sentimentalism;
he remembered how once he used
to ridicule this in others, how he sneered without
pity, how he despised even sentimentalism.
Augustinovich knew this best of all.</p>

<p>A certain time (about a month after the
breaking with Lula) Augustinovich, waking up
late in the night, saw Yosef dressed yet and sitting
with a book. The clock in the silent night
told the fleeting moments untiringly. A lamp
burnt with a clear, bright flame, and by its
light the ruddy side whiskers and pale face of
Yosef were outlined clearly on the black cover
of the chair. He was sitting with head bent
back and closed eyes, but he was not sleeping,
his raised brows and the color of his face testified
to this. His face had an expression of unspeakable
bliss; some kind of dream, like a
golden butterfly, was sitting on his brain and
melting into misty mildness the sharp lines of
his features.</p>

<p>Augustinovich looked at him carefully, then
rose in the bed silently with a face full of
indignation and anger. "What is he doing?"
thought he. "Thou art tempting thyself!
May I be hanged if I don't throw a pillow at
thy head. Thou booby! Yes, I will throw
the pillow! break the lamp&mdash;Hei!"</p>

<p>He had finished in a moment these warlike
preparations, and was making ready to give
the terrible blow, when he pushed under the
blanket quickly; Yosef opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am curious to know what will happen
now," muttered Augustinovich, pretending to
sleep like a dead man. Meanwhile his astonishment
grew in earnest.</p>

<p>Yosef looked at him suspiciously, then
looked around like a criminal; finally he pulled
out a drawer of the table and searched in it for
some object.</p>

<p>"Ei! if he only does not want to shoot himself
in the head, or poison himself," thought
Augustinovich, terrified.</p>

<p>But Yosef had no thought of shooting or
poisoning himself. The object which he drew
forth was a glove. One small yellow wrinkled
glove. Ei! a poor little memorial, a historical
gift with which one says remember me. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio!
addio! caro mio!</i> Remember me. Yosef, like
that Emrod of old, would have gone for the
glove "among two leopards and a tiger for
it," but the question remained as to whether he
went away after that and never returned. In
point of stupidity the centuries agree oftener
than in sound judgment.</p>

<p>Yosef raised the glove to his lips.</p>

<p>"Be ashamed, old man!" roared Augustinovich.</p>

<p>In truth, there was something humiliating in
this, and afterward Yosef was greatly ashamed
of his act. Next morning he went out before
daylight to avoid Augustinovich, who was seriously
angry and indignant. It seemed to him
that he had been deceived in Yosef.</p>

<p>"That dunce," said he, "is like others."
This idea roused that distaste in him which we
feel usually on beginning to lose regard for a
man whom we have thus far respected.</p>

<p>More important still was it that after that
event Augustinovich grew convinced that
Yosef would return to Lula. "Let the other
die or go mad," said he of the widow. "They
will take each other, let her die&mdash;Ei, let her
die" (Augustinovich always tried to persuade
himself that he did not like women), "there
will be one less of them. Yosef will go back
to Lula, he will."</p>

<p>He meditated then whether to tell Lula that
Yosef was to marry, or not; in the end he
resolved to be silent.</p>

<p>"But Helena is nothing to me. He will
return to Lula; if I tell her everything it will
be too late&mdash;it will be too late! Oh, ho, ho!
But Helena too will lose, for again it will be
too late. Yes, yes, I should not be able to
correct the one, and should spoil the other. I
shall say nothing, I will be silent&mdash;I will be
silent."</p>

<p>He preferred Helena to Lula, a hundred
times, and from his soul he preferred that
Yosef should marry Helena; but he cared
more for Yosef than for both women, therefore
he wished Lula to be free "in every
case." Besides, he considered that come what
might, Lula would take Pelski. "Then,"
thought he, "I will tell the old man. 'Dost
see,' I will say to him, 'I said nothing about
Helena, she knew nothing about thy not
loving her; still she married Pelski.'"</p>

<p>Finally, he concealed carefully the news of
Yosef's intended marriage, in case that Lula,
laughing and happy in view of Yosef's hypothetical
return, should give her hand to Pelski.
"Yosef will wish happiness to the lady, I will
say 'Crescite et multiplicamini! He,' I shall
say, pointing to Yosef, 'has been betrothed this
long time; he loves and is loved immensely.'"</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Days</span> passed, still Yosef did not return to the
countess, but Malinka said to Augustinovich,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pelski may offer himself any day to Lula."</p>

<p>"And if he does not, she may offer herself
to him," answered Augustinovich, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is not true, not true."</p>

<p>"We shall see."</p>

<p>"No, Pan Adam. Lula has much womanly
pride, and if she should marry Pelski it would
be only through that same pride, through anger
at Yosef's indifference. Besides, to tell the
truth, Pelski is the only man who loves her,
for he is the only one who has remained&mdash;on
whom she can count."</p>

<p>"Ah! but evidently she likes to count on
some one."</p>

<p>Malinka was angry.</p>

<p>"She counted once on Pan Yosef; she was
deceived. How can you blame her, when he
does not come&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;when
he does not come?"</p>

<p>Pan Adam was silent.</p>

<p>"She has been deceived painfully," continued
Malinka, "and believe me, I alone know what
that costs her, and though we are not so
friendly as before (she rejected me herself), I
see often how she suffers. Yesterday I went
to her room and found her in tears. 'Lula!'
asked I, though she withdrew from me, 'what
is the matter with thee?' 'Nothing, I suffer
from headache,' said she. 'My Lula,' said I,
'thou hast heartache, not headache!' I wished
to throw myself on her neck, but she pushed
me aside, and then stood up with such haughtiness
that I was frightened. 'I was crying from
shame,' said she, firmly. 'Wilt thou understand,
from shame!' I wished to understand her, but
was unable; I only know that the evening of
that day I saw her in tears again. And dost
thou see?"</p>

<p>"What does all this prove?"</p>

<p>"That it is not easy for her to renounce her
idea of Yosef. What has happened that he
does not come?"</p>

<p>"But if he should come?"</p>

<p>"She would not marry Pelski."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ridicule the idea that 'she would
not.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, for you ridicule everything. But Pan
Yosef? Is it noble on his part to desert her
in this way?"</p>

<p>"Who knows what he intends to do?"</p>

<p>"He ought to know himself," answered
Malinka, decidedly, "and he should not conceal
his intentions from her."</p>

<p>"He has no time, he is working."</p>

<p>That day, however, Malinka convinced herself
that Yosef was not sitting so diligently
at home as Augustinovich had represented.
While walking with her mother, she met him
passing with some young man. He did not
notice them. Malinka was almost terrified at
his appearance. He seemed to her as pale
and crushed as if he had recovered from a
grievous illness. "Then he has been sick,"
thought she, after returning home. Now she
understood why Pan Adam would not explain
the absence. "Yosef commanded him not
to frighten Lula." All at once Yosef rose in
Malinka's eyes to the loftiness of an ideal.</p>

<p>Augustinovich came in the evening, as usual.
In the drawing-room Pani Visberg and the
countess were present.</p>

<p>"Pan Adam," exclaimed Malinka, "I know
why Pan Yosef has not been here for so long a
time!"</p>

<p>Lula's eyes gleamed, but that moment she
controlled herself; still her hands trembled
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"The poor man, he must have been very
sick; he is as pale as if he had come out of
a coffin! Why did you not tell us of this?"
asked Pani Visberg, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pan Adam was afraid that we should
speak of it before Lula. Was that nice?"
asked Malinka.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee, Lula? Art
sick?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! I will come back in a
moment."</p>

<p>Her face was pale, breath failed her. She
went out, almost fled to her chamber. Pani
Visberg wished to follow her. Malinka detained
her gently but decisively.</p>

<p>"Thou must not go, mamma."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Augustinovich; her voice
had a sad and serious sound.</p>

<p>"Pan Adam?"</p>

<p>Augustinovich bit his lips.</p>

<p>"Pan Adam! What is this? 'Lula is a
coquette without a heart,' is she not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was mistaken," blurted out
Augustinovich; "but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not dare to cough out of himself
at the moment that Yosef was going to
marry Helena, that he would not come any
more.</p>

<p>On returning home he was also afraid to
tell Yosef what had happened.</p>

<p>Lula shut herself up in her chamber. Her
head was on fire, and thoughts like a garland
of sparks and ice were besieging her temples,
and in the silence could be heard distinctly her
hurried breathing and the throbbing of her
heart. Pelski, Malinka, Pan Adam whirled
around her in inexplicable chaos, and out of
those fragments of thought as out of a grave
rose higher and higher the pale, almost lifeless
head of Yosef, with closed eyes. "He is sick!
he is sick!" repeated she, in a whisper. "He
will die, and never come here again."</p>

<p>Poor Lula interpreted differently from Malinka
Yosef's absence. She judged that he had
sacrificed himself for her,&mdash;that, not wishing
to stand between her and Pelski, he had renounced
her, and therefore he suffered so
much and was sick. "Still, who told him that
I should be happy with Pelski?" whispered
she, quietly. "He did not trust me. My God,
my God! but could he trust me?"</p>

<p>Memory brought before her as a reproach
those moments of gleaming looks, alluring
smiles, and velvety words given to Pelski; she
remembered also that blush of shame with
which she was blazing when Pelski learned
that Yosef was the son of a blacksmith. And
now she hid her burning face in her hands, but
that was shame of another kind. It seemed to
her at that moment that if Yosef himself were a
blacksmith she would kiss his blackened forehead
with delight even; even with perfect happiness
would she place her head on his valiant
breast, though it were covered with the apron
of a blacksmith.</p>

<p>"How dark it is in my eyes! I did not
know that I loved him," said she, trembling
and aflame.</p>

<p>Her bosom moved quickly! Again some
thought the most tender decked out her forehead
with the brightness of an angel; she
threw herself on her knees before an image
of the Virgin.</p>

<p>"O mother of God!" cried she, aloud, "if
any one has to suffer or to die, let me suffer,
but preserve and love him, O Most Holy
Mother!"</p>

<p>Then she rose in calmness, and was so bright
with the light of love that one might have
said that a silver lamp was shining in that dark
little chamber before the image of the Holy
Virgin.</p>

<p>During the two following days Augustinovich
did not appear; but Pelski came, and according
to Malinka's previsions, proposed to Lula.
Seeing his cousin's face calm, and smiling
with good hope, he expressed to her his
hopes and wishes. The more painful was his
astonishment when Lula gave him a decisively
negative answer.</p>

<p>"I love another," was the substance of her
answer.</p>

<p>Pelski wanted to learn who "that other"
was. Lula told him without hesitation; then,
as is done usually on such occasions, she
offered him her friendship.</p>

<p>But Pelski did not accept the hand extended
to him at parting.</p>

<p>"You have taken too much from me, you
give me too little, cousin," whispered he, in a
crushed voice. "For the happiness of a lifetime&mdash;friendship!!"</p>

<p>But Lula felt no reproach after his departure.
She was thinking of something else. This is
the bad side of love, that it never thinks of
anything but itself. It excludes particulars,
but as a recompense includes the whole.
Thou feelest that if the world were one man
thou wouldst press him to thy bosom and kiss
him on the head as a father.</p>

<p>Something like that did Lula feel when she
went to Malinka's chamber after Pelski's visit.
She needed to confess to some one all that lay
on her heart.</p>

<p>Malinka was sitting near the window. In
the twilight, on the darkened panes, could be
seen her mild, thoughtful little face. All at
once Lula's arms were clasped around her neck.</p>

<p>"Is that thou, Lula?" asked she, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"I, Malinka!" answered Lula.</p>

<p>She was sitting on a small stool near Malinka's
feet; she put her head on her knees.</p>

<p>"My kind Malinka, thou art not angry with
me now, and dost not despise me?"</p>

<p>Malinka fondled her like a child.</p>

<p>"I was very much to blame as thou seest, but
in my own heart I have found myself to-day.
How pleasant it is for me here near thee! As
formerly we talked long and often&mdash;let it be
so to-day! Art thou willing?"</p>

<p>Malinka smiled half sadly, half jestingly, and
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let it be so to-day, but later it will change.
A certain 'His grace' will come and take
Lula away, and I shall be left alone."</p>

<p>"But will he come?" inquired Lula, in a
very low whisper.</p>

<p>"He will come. The poor man was sick
surely from yearning. I did not understand
what it meant that Pan Adam would not tell
me why he came not; now I understand. Pan
Yosef forbade him, he would not terrify thee."</p>

<p>"I think that he did not wish to hinder
Pelski&mdash;so unkind of him to do this."</p>

<p>"But what did Pelski do?"</p>

<p>"I was just going to tell thee. He proposed
to me to-day."</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"I refused him, Malinka."</p>

<p>Silence continued awhile.</p>

<p>"He would not even take my hand when I
gave it at parting, but could I do otherwise?
I know that I acted very unkindly, very unkindly,
but could I act otherwise? I do not
love him."</p>

<p>"Better late than never. Thou didst obey
the voice of thy heart. Only with Pan Yosef
canst thou be happy."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is true, true."</p>

<p>"In a month or so," continued Malinka, "we
shall array Lula in a white robe, weep over
Lula the maiden and rejoice over Lula the
wife. Thou wilt be happy, he and thou. He
must be a good man, since all respect him so
much."</p>

<p>"Do all respect him so much?" repeated
Lula, who wanted to laugh and cry at the same
moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma fears him even, and I
also fear him a little, but I respect him for his
character."</p>

<p>Lula put both hands under her head, and
resting on Malinka's knees, looked into her
face with eyes bright from tears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it grew perfectly dark, then the
moon rose, the dogs fell asleep; nothing was
to be heard save the whispers of the two
maidens filled with fancies by their talk.</p>

<p>All at once they were interrupted by the
bell at the entrance.</p>

<p>"Maybe that is he!" cried Lula.</p>

<p>But it was not "he," for in the first room
was heard Augustinovich's voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are the ladies at home?"</p>

<p>"Go, Lula, into that room and hide there,"
said Malinka, quickly. "I will tell him how
thou didst give the refusal to Pelski, I will beg
him to repeat it to Pan Yosef. We shall see
if he does not come. Thou mayst listen
there."</p>

<p>The door opened. Augustinovich entered.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have said that Augustinovich feared to
tell Yosef what had happened at Pani Visberg's.
Lula had deceived his expectations;
in spite of aristocracy, in spite of Pelski, she
loved the young doctor, since news of his
sickness had shocked her to such a degree.</p>

<p>Augustinovich lost his humor and the freedom
of thought usual to him. Whether he
would or not, he felt respect for Lula, and he
felt respect for woman. Ei! that was something
so strange in him, so out of harmony
with his moral make up, that he could not
come into agreement with himself. He had
the look of a man caught in a falsehood, and
the falsehood was his understanding of woman.
He grew very gloomy. Once even (a wonderful
thing and strange for him, or forgotten)
words were forced from him that were full of
painful bitterness: "Oh, if one like her could
be met in a lifetime, a man would not be what
he is." He avoided Yosef, he feared him, he
hesitated, he wished to confess everything;
then again he deferred it till the morrow.</p>

<p>Finally Yosef himself took note of his
strange demeanor.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with thee, Adam?"
asked he.</p>

<p>"But of Lula he cannot ask!" cried Augustinovich,
with comical despair.</p>

<p>Yosef sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Of Lula? What does that mean? Speak!"</p>

<p>"It means nothing; what should it mean?
Is all this to mean something right away?"</p>

<p>"Augustinovich, thou art hiding something?"</p>

<p>"But the fellow is thinking only of Lula!"
cried Augustinovich, with increasing despair.</p>

<p>Yosef with unheard-of effort mastered himself,
but that was a calm before a terrible storm.
His sunken cheeks grew still paler, his eyes
were flaming.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell thee all!" cried Augustinovich,
anticipating the outburst. "I will tell,
I will tell! Ei, who will forbid me to tell thee
that thou hast won the case! May Satan &mdash;&mdash; me if thou hast not won. She loves thee."</p>

<p>Yosef put his trembling hands to his perspiring
face.</p>

<p>"But Pelski?" asked he.</p>

<p>"He has not proposed yet."</p>

<p>"Does she know everything about me?"</p>

<p>"Yosef!"</p>

<p>"Speak!"</p>

<p>"She knows nothing. I told her nothing."</p>

<p>Yosef's voice was dull and hoarse when he
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why hast thou done me this injustice?"</p>

<p>"I thought that thou wouldst return to her."</p>

<p>Yosef twisted his hands till the fingers were
cracking in their joints; Augustinovich's last
words fell on him like red-hot coals. Return
to her? That was to abandon Helena, and
did not conscience itself defend Helena's cause?
To return to Lula was to purchase the happiness
of a lifetime, but to return to her was to
dishonor Helena, to kill her, to become contemptible,
to purchase contempt for himself.
Oh, misfortune!</p>

<p>In Yosef's soul was taking place that devil's
dance of a man with himself. Yosef was
dancing with Yosef to the music of that
orchestra of passion. Various thoughts, plans,
methods, stormed in him; the battle raged
along the whole line.</p>

<p>Augustinovich looked at his comrade with a
face which was despairingly stupid, and he
would have liked, as the saying is, to take
himself by his own collar and throw himself
out of doors.</p>

<p>All at once some decision was outlined on
Yosef's face. The case was lost.</p>

<p>"Augustinovich!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt go this moment to Pani Visberg's
and tell Lula that I am going to marry,
that the ceremony will take place in a month,
and that I never shall return to her, never.
Dost understand?"</p>

<p>Augustinovich rose up and went.</p>

<p>Malinka received him in the way known to
us. Lula was to hear their conversation from
behind the door.</p>

<p>Malinka, full of imaginings from her recent
talk with Lula, was gladsome and smiling; she
pressed Pan Adam's hand cordially.</p>

<p>But he did not respond with a like cordiality.</p>

<p>"It is well that you have come," said she.
"I have much to tell you, much."</p>

<p>"And I too have much to tell, much. I
have come as an envoy."</p>

<p>"From Pan Yosef?"</p>

<p>"From Pan Yosef."</p>

<p>"Is he better?"</p>

<p>"He is sick. Has Pelski been here?"</p>

<p>"He has. I have wanted to talk of this."</p>

<p>"I am listening, Panna Malinka."</p>

<p>"He proposed to Lula."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"She refused him. Oh, Pan Adam, she
loves no man but Pan Yosef, she wants
to belong to him only. My dear, honest
Lula!"</p>

<p>Silence lasted a moment.</p>

<p>Pan Adam's voice quivered when he pronounced
the following words deliberately,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She will not belong to him."</p>

<p>"Pan Adam!"</p>

<p>"Yosef, according to promise, is going to
marry."</p>

<p>This news struck both young ladies like a
thunderbolt. For a moment there was deep
silence. All at once the door of the adjoining
chamber opened. Lula entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>On her face a blush of offended womanly
dignity was playing, in her eyes pride was
gleaming. It seemed to her that everything
which she held sacred in her heart had been
trampled.</p>

<p>"Malinka," cried she, "ask no more, I implore
thee! Enough, enough! This gentleman
has delivered his message. Why lower
one's self by an answer?"</p>

<p>And taking Malinka by the hand, she led
her out of the chamber almost with violence.</p>

<p>Augustinovich followed them awhile with
his eyes, then nodded a couple of times.</p>

<p>"By the prophet!" said he, "I understand
her. She is right, but so is Yosef. Hei! I
must fly before everything breaks."</p>

<p>In a moment he ran to Pelski, told him the
whole story.</p>

<p>"Some fatality weighed on them," concluded
Augustinovich. "Yosef could not act
otherwise, could he?"</p>

<p>"He acted as was fitting, but what inclined
you to tell me of this?"</p>

<p>"A bagatelle. One question: Did not
Lula act nobly in rejecting your hand?"</p>

<p>"I will leave the answer to myself."</p>

<p>"Leave it, my dear sir! The answer is all
one to me, Lula is nothing to me; I know
only that if my friend withdraws her future
will not be enviable, and you are her cousin&mdash;The case is too bad."</p>

<p>Pelski thought awhile.</p>

<p>"Too bad? Ha, what is too bad?"</p>

<p>"That your proposal did not come a little
later."</p>

<p>Pelski walked with quick step through the
room.</p>

<p>"Now, never!" whispered he to himself.</p>

<p>Augustinovich heard this monologue.</p>

<p>"Too late, too late; but&mdash;but&mdash;now one
small request. Tell no one that I was here,
especially do not tell Pani Visberg or my
friend if ever you see them."</p>

<p>"What is this to your friend?"</p>

<p>"Everything; but you would not understand
it, dear count&mdash;Till our next meeting!"</p>

<p>Pelski, left alone, meditated long as to how
that could really concern Augustinovich. He
did not think out any answer, but came to the
conviction that it might concern his own self
somewhat.</p>

<p>"I might return to her, feigning ignorance of
what has happened," said he. "Poor Lula!"</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> two young ladies were sitting in Lula's
chamber. That was a painful silence. If
there are grievous moments in life, they had
thrown their weight on the present fate of
Lula. Everything which she held sacred in
her breast had been trampled. She had put
into that love the best parts of her moral
existence, the victory to her had been like
a wedding solemnity; by the power of this
feeling she had risen from a momentary fall,
she had conquered family prejudice, rejected
the hand of a man who loved her, and with
it a calm future, life in plenty, her own independence,
and the pay for all this was information
that he whom she loved was to marry
another.</p>

<p>Ei! she lost still more. All the angelic qualities
which preceding days had given her were
crushed now into ruins of despair. Her soul
might wither to its foundation! Had she not
lost with love also faith and hope, not in their
theological sense, but in all their vital value
for life? The ground was pushing from under
her. Like a boat without an oar, she was to
drift in the future beyond sight of shore.
To-day an orphan gathered in by honest
hearts, she may find herself to-morrow simply
suffering hunger, without a morsel of bread;
to-day so white that lilies might bloom on her
breast, she may in future stain that whiteness
with the gall of her own bitterness: to-day
half a child almost, in the spring, in the May
morning, she may after this or that number of
years have to look at her life's fruitless autumn.</p>

<p>Humiliated, broken, "like twigs after a tempest,"
pushed away from her moral basis, killed
in her happiness; with dry burning eyes she
pressed the weeping Malinka to her bosom
convulsively.</p>

<p>Lula did not weep, although she had tears
enough for weeping; anger had dried them.
But Malinka cried enough for both.</p>

<hr class="inv" />

<p>Next morning the countess received two
letters,&mdash;one from Pelski, the other from
Yosef.</p>

<p class="font90">"<span class="smcap">Madame</span> (wrote Pelski),&mdash;The pain which I
felt in consequence of your answer did not permit
me to reckon with my words. I rejected the friendship
which you offered me. I regret that act. Though
I cannot explain your treatment of me, I see that you
followed the voice of your heart. I trust that that
voice has not deceived you. If he whom you have
chosen loves you as much as I should, be assured of
your happiness. I reproach him not, I dare not judge
a man whom you love. As to myself, forced by stern
necessity to part with the hope of possessing you, I
implore you as the highest favor not to remember my
words thrown out in a moment of pain. Permit me
to return and claim that friendship inconsiderately
rejected, friendship which for me in the future may
take the place of the happiness of a lifetime."</p>

<p>In the evening Augustinovich brought a
letter from Yosef. Lula did not wish to
open it.</p>

<p>"Do not do him injustice," said Augustinovich,
imploringly, "for at the present moment
my old friend is perhaps&mdash;" Tears
choked him, further words stuck in his throat.
"These may be his last words&mdash;I took him
to the hospital yesterday," whispered he.</p>

<p>Lula grew as pale as linen. It seemed for a
moment that she would faint. In vain did she
strive to preserve a calm and cool face, her
whole body shook like a leaf. Come what
might, she loved Yosef.</p>

<p>She took from Pan Adam's hand the letter,
which read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="font90">"<span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;I was able to endure the loss of
your hand, but not of your respect. Read and judge.
A dying friend left to my care a woman whom he
loved with all the power of a suffering heart. I had
deprived him of the love of this woman without wishing
to do so. After his death I became acquainted
with her more intimately, and it seemed to me that I
loved her. Unfortunately I told her so. After that
you know, beloved lady, what happened. After that
I hid from myself my ill-fated attachment to you.
How much I suffered! Oh, pardon me! I am a
man, I too must love, but still it was not from my
lips that you learned of that love. When at last
I stood before my own conscience, when the moment
of memory came, judge yourself, how was I to act,
whither was I to go, what was I to do? The oath
to a dying man, the word given to a woman unhappy
beyond expression, everything except my heart commanded
me to abdicate you. It was not through my
fault that you learned of this only yesterday. This
news should have gone to you at the time when
Count Pelski appeared. Misfortune, and the frivolity
of a man ordained otherwise. This is the state
of affairs! Judge, and, if you are able, forgive.
Adam says that I am ill. This is true: my thoughts
are weeping, I feel a burning in my blood, and out
of pain and chaos I see one thing clearly,&mdash;that I
love! that I love thee, O angel!"</p>

<p>After the reading of this letter the remnants
of anger and pride vanished from Lula's forehead, on her beautiful face a mild though deep
melancholy fixed itself.</p>

<p>"Pan Adam," said she, "tell the gentleman
that he has acted as he should."</p>

<p>"And forgive me, dear lady," said Augustinovich,
throwing himself on his knees. "I was
unjust. I did you a wrong, but I had no idea,
I knew not, that there were such women in the
world as you are."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Augustinovich</span> went directly from Pani Visberg's
to the hospital, where he remained all
night. Yosef was ill, very ill. Typhus rushed
at that strong organism, threatening it with
utter destruction. About midnight the sick
man began to rave; he talked with himself,
and argued obstinately on the immortality of
the soul with a black cat which he saw sitting
on the bed. It appeared that he feared death,
for a number of times indescribable terror was
depicted on his face. He feared and trembled
very acutely after every movement of Augustinovich.
At moments he sang with a quivering
voice, and as it were through sleep various
gladsome and melancholy songs, or conversed
with acquaintances. There was even a kind of
astonishing humor in the naturalness of tones
in these conversations.</p>

<p>Augustinovich, unmanned already by the
events of preceding days, was irritated unspeakably.
He waited for morning with longing,
looking often at the window-panes, which,
as if through spite, continued to be as black as
ever. Outside there was deep darkness, and
fine rain began to cut the window-panes, filling
the hospital chamber with a sound which
was monotonous and disagreeable.</p>

<p>For a long time such sad and disquieting
thoughts had not wandered into Augustinovich's
head as at that moment. Resting his
elbows on his knees and covering his face with
his hands, he meditated over the marvellous
and painful complication of events during
the last few days. Sometimes he raised his
head and cast a quick glance at the sick man;
at times it seemed to him that the gloom of
death was falling on the withered, sharp features
of Yosef.</p>

<p>Augustinovich pondered over this, how a
man, so active and broadly living a short
time before, would be in a couple of days,
perhaps, something dead, which they would
bury in the ground, and the comedy would be
ended! Oh, an ordinary, everyday thought,
and every day equally bitter for those who
must think: This is the end! dust! Still,
when he lived with full life, he judged, analyzed,
acted perhaps more widely than others.
As a plough turns out the sod, so he, in the soil
of life, from the furrows of good and evil was
winning good and&mdash;? Involuntarily one asks
for the moral sense of this fable. Where,
when, on what planets, will living persons find
an answer beyond the tomb? Immortality?&mdash;In
the ocean of human acts perhaps a few
moral atoms of the deeds of the dead survive,
but that I, powerful, energetically self-conscious,
where is it? And those atoms of acts
are like the corpse of a sailor dropped down
from a ship into the abyss of the sea. Where
shall we look for them, and who will find them?
Will God ever fish them out from those shoreless
billows, and will He develop from them
a new self-conscious being? "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it"> bene trovato!</i>"
The bitterness of these thoughts settled now
on the sleepy forehead of Augustinovich, but
meanwhile the window-panes from black began
to turn gray. It was dawning. In the chamber
the light of the candle grew rosier gradually
and fainter, objects began to issue from the
shade. In the corridors were heard now the
steps of the hospital servants. An hour later
the doctor came in.</p>

<p>"How is the patient?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"Ill," answered Augustinovich, abruptly.</p>

<p>The doctor thrust out his lower lip with importance,
wrinkled his forehead, and felt the
pulse of the sick man.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" inquired Augustinovich.</p>

<p>"Well, what? I think nothing&mdash;he is ill,
very ill."</p>

<p>A shade of irony passed over Augustinovich's
face.</p>

<p>"But I think, professor, that medicine is a
very dull child which believes that if it takes
its heels in its hands it can lift itself. Is this
not the case?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded a couple of times, prescribed
some cooling medicine, and went out.
Augustinovich, looking at the prescription,
shook his head in his turn, shrugged his
shoulders, and sat at the bed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the patient grew worse toward
evening, about midnight he was almost dying.
Augustinovich wept like a child and knocked
himself against the walls of the chamber. He
sat up again through the whole night.</p>

<p>Toward morning it seemed to him that he
noticed a slight improvement, but that improvement
was deceptive. Pale and red spots
appeared on the sick man; evidently he had
burnt out in fever and was quenching.</p>

<p>In the evening Pani Visberg came. Augustinovich
would not admit her to the room.
From his face she learned that something terrible
must be happening.</p>

<p>"Is he alive?" cried she.</p>

<p>"He is dying!" answered Augustinovich,
briefly.</p>

<p>A few hours later the chaplain of the hospital
anointed Yosef. Augustinovich had not
strength to be present at the ceremony; he ran
out into the city.</p>

<p>He needed to collect his thoughts, he needed
to draw breath; he felt that his thoughts were
beginning to grow dim&mdash;very likely the loss
of Yosef would destroy his balance. He had
expected everything, but not that Yosef would
die.</p>

<p>He did not know himself whither he was
hurrying; a number of times he halted as if in
fear that he would return too late.</p>

<p>All at once some thought flashed through his
head; he noticed that he was standing before
Helena's lodgings.</p>

<p>"I will go in. Let her take farewell of
him!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later Helena was kneeling at
Yosef's bed. Her unbound hair was lying in
broad tresses on the bed; she was embracing
the sick man's feet with her hands, her face
resting on them.</p>

<p>In that room of the hospital reigned a silence
of the grave; nothing was heard but the quick
broken breath of Yosef.</p>

<p>So passed the long, cursed night, every
moment of which seemed the last one for
Yosef. Finally, on the thirteenth day from the
first the disease was vanquished. Yosef was
decidedly better.</p>

<p>At his bed sat, without leaving it, Augustinovich
and Helena; the latter seemed to forget
the world at that bed. With Yosef's life life
returned to Helena also. She was delighted
to ecstasy with even the smallest proof of improvement.</p>

<p>At last Yosef regained consciousness.</p>

<p>Augustinovich was not present at that moment;
the first person whom he saw was
Helena.</p>

<p>The sick man looked at her for a moment;
on his forehead a certain working of thought
became evident.</p>

<p>At last he recalled her to mind. He smiled.
Evidently the smile was forced; still Helena
threw herself on her knees with tears of
delight.</p>

<p>But Augustinovich when he returned noticed
that her presence disquieted the sick man and
even tortured him. Yosef did not take his
eyes from Helena for an instant; he followed
every movement of hers.</p>

<p>With that inane gesticulation peculiar to old
or to sick people he moved his lips.</p>

<p>Augustinovich followed Yosef's eyes carefully.
He had a foreboding of evil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as usual, toward evening the
fever increased; still the sick man fell asleep.
Augustinovich strove to persuade Helena to go
home for rest.</p>

<p>"I will not leave him for a moment," answered
she, with what for her was uncommon
decision.</p>

<p>Augustinovich took his seat in the armchair
in silence and meditated deeply; soon his head
began to weigh on him, his lids became leaden,
an invincible drowsiness seized him with increasing
force, his head dropped on his breast,
he nodded to the right, to the left, and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>After a while he woke again.</p>

<p>"Is he sleeping?" inquired he, looking at
Yosef.</p>

<p>"He is sleeping, but unquietly," answered
Helena.</p>

<p>Augustinovich again dropped his head.
Suddenly a shriek from Helena roused him.</p>

<p>The sick man was sitting up in bed in a
paroxysm of malignant fever; his face was
burning, his eyes glittering like those of a
wolf; his emaciated hand was extended toward
Helena.</p>

<p>"What is this!" cried Augustinovich.</p>

<p>Helena seized him convulsively by the hands;
she felt that his whole body trembled.</p>

<p>"Do not torture me!" whispered the sick
man, with a hoarse, broken voice. "Thou hast
killed Gustav, and now thou wouldst kill me.
Away! I do not love thee! Be off!"</p>

<p>Again he fell on the bed.</p>

<p>"Lula, my Lula, save me!" whispered Yosef.</p>

<p>Augustinovich almost by force conducted
Helena from the chamber. In the corridor
was heard for a while quick conversation, and
the name of the countess was repeated. At
last Augustinovich returned alone.</p>

<p>He was pale, great drops of sweat were flowing
down his forehead.</p>

<p>"Everything is ended now," said he, in a
whisper.</p>

<hr class="inv" />

<p>Helena ran driven by despair. Yosef's
words and the brief conversation with Augustinovich
had cleared as with a bloody lightning-flash
many circumstances which had been dark
to her. She ran with the single object of going
straight forward. Her thoughts were burning
her like fire, or rather they were thoughts no
longer, they were a circle of fire sparks driven
around madly by a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The city in that evening hour was lighted
with a thousand lamps, calm domestic fires
looked through the clear windows at her. She
ran on. Through the streets throngs of people
flowed forward as usual; some passers-by
turned around to gaze at her; one young
man said something with a smile, but looking
her in the eyes he drew back in fright. She
ran on. At last instead of streets there were
alleys, next alleys which were emptier and
darker. In the windows lights were evident
no longer; there the wearied population were
sleeping after the toil of the day; in a rare
place a lamp gleamed, or the echoes of a footstep
were heard.</p>

<p>The night was damp, but calm; a kind of
weight oppressive to the spirit was hanging in
the atmosphere. From the Dnieper came a
harsh breeze; a watery mist left drops on
Helena's clothing and hair. On, on she ran.
Nervous spasms distorted her face. In spite
of the coolness it seemed to her that fire from
heaven was falling on her head, her hands,
and her breast. Those little fires seemed
to dance and whirl about her, and in each
one of them she saw the face now of Yosef,
now of Gustav. Her cape had fallen off, the
wind had torn her hat away, dampness unbound
her hair. She fell to the earth a number
of times. Soon amid night and emptiness
she found herself alone. Only the distant
noise of the city and the barking of dogs in
that part through which she was hastening
pursued her. She ran ever forward.</p>

<p>She felt neither torture nor pain. All her
thoughts rushed to one centre; that was her
misfortune. When love takes a part of one's
life, it pays with disappointment; for Helena
love had been everything. Existence for her
had ceased now to have sense. The charm
was broken. There was no forgiveness for
that woman, though she had "loved much;"
there could be only peace, not in life, but
beyond it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she ran forward, but strength was
deserting her. Her lips had grown parched,
her eyes were now dim, her clothing wet and
bespattered with mud. She fell oftener and
oftener; sometimes she turned her face to
the sky, seizing the air greedily. The ground
on which she was running became wetter and
wetter. From afar could be heard now the
sobbing of the wave, and that marvellous converse
of water, half fitful, half gloomy.</p>

<p>At the brink Helena halted a moment.</p>

<p>Closing her eyes on a sudden and stretching
her hands out before her, the woman rushed
forward.</p>

<p>With the plash in the river was heard a
short scream, stopped by the water,&mdash;her last
scream.</p>

<p>Then followed silence. Deep night was in
the sky.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Everything</span> is marvellously involved in this
poor world," said the ancient poet. This is
certain, that more than once life becomes so
involved that it is only to be cut like that
Gordian knot of old. So was it with Yosef.</p>

<p>A few years before he had come to Kieff
full of confidence in his own strength. It had
seemed to him that he could push forward not
only his own fate, but that of others in a way
chosen in advance. Meanwhile he had convinced
himself that in a short time he had lost
the rudder even of his own boat. He had been
left to rush and save himself if he wished, but
he had to sail with the wind, and therewith he
had little happiness in life. In his case, as in
that of all men, life, or rather the excess of that
seething of youthful years, had to pour out in
the single but very narrow direction of love
for woman. There was little space between
the banks; hence the stream flowed too violently,
so that in all Yosef's past there were
barely a few peaceful moments. He lacked
little of paying with his life for the past, and
God knows there was nothing to pay for.
After the last incident with Helena the danger
might be renewed. Augustinovich feared relapse;
happily his fears were not justified.</p>

<p>Yosef improved continually. It was difficult
to foresee how long he would have to lie
in bed yet; his weakness after the grievous
illness was very great, but his return to health
was assured.</p>

<p>Augustinovich shortened the long hospital
hours to the best of his power and ability, but
vain were his efforts to win back the old-time
humor. Recent events had made him sedate
and sparing of words. He had lost many of
his old habits. From the time of Yosef's illness
he had not visited Pani Visberg even
once, though she came rather often to inquire
for Yosef's health.</p>

<p>But if in this way events of recent days had
acted on Augustinovich, how much more had
they acted on Yosef! Out of his long illness
he rose a new man altogether. He had no
longer that lively, active, unbending temperament.
In his movements there was slowness,
in his look heaviness, and as it were indolence.</p>

<p>Augustinovich attributed this, and justly, to
the weakness unavoidable after such an illness,
but soon he noticed in the sick man other
things foreign to him before. A certain marvellous
indifference approaching apathy broke
through his words. He began to look at the
world again, but in a manner entirely different
from that in which he had looked at it earlier.
He seemed to be capable of no vivacious feeling.
It was disagreeable to look at him; these
changes had touched not merely his moral side,
he had changed physically also. His hair had
grown thin, his face was white and emaciated,
his eyes had a sleepy look, he had lost his
former brightness. Lying whole days without
movement, he looked for hours together at
one point in the ceiling, or slept. The presence
of any one did not seem to concern him.</p>

<p>All this alarmed Augustinovich, especially
when he considered that in spite of the speedy
return of physical strength these symptoms, if
they yielded, yielded very slowly. He sighed
when he remembered the former Yosef, and
he labored to rouse the present one, but the
labor was difficult.</p>

<p>A certain time Augustinovich, sitting by the
bed of the sick man, read aloud to him. Yosef
was lying on his back; according to habit he
was looking at the ceiling. Evidently he was
thinking of something else, or was thinking of
nothing, for after a certain time annoyance
was expressed on his face. Augustinovich
stopped reading.</p>

<p>"Dost wish to sleep?"</p>

<p>"No, but the book wearies me."</p>

<p>Augustinovich was reading "Dame aux
Camlias."</p>

<p>"Still, there is life and truth here."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there is not judgment to the value
of a copper."</p>

<p>"Still, the book raises the question of such
women!"</p>

<p>"But whom do such women concern?"</p>

<p>"They once concerned thee."</p>

<p>Yosef said nothing; on his face a slight
thoughtfulness was evident.</p>

<p>After a time he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is happening with Helena? Has she
been here?"</p>

<p>Augustinovich was confused.</p>

<p>"She has been here, she has been here."</p>

<p>"Well, and now?"</p>

<p>"That is&mdash;yes&mdash;she is sick, very sick."</p>

<p>Yosef's face continued indifferent.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her?" asked he,
leisurely.</p>

<p>"With her?&mdash;She&mdash;Well, I will tell thee
the truth, only be not frightened."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Helena is no longer alive&mdash;she was
drowned."</p>

<p>Some sort of indefinite impression shot over
Yosef's face; he made an effort as if to rise in
the bed, but after a while he dropped his head
on the pillow.</p>

<p>"By accident or design?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Rest, old man, rest; it is not permitted
thee to talk much. Later I will tell everything."</p>

<p>Yosef turned to the wall and sank into
silence. At that moment a servant of the
hospital entered.</p>

<p>"Pani Visberg wishes to see you," said he
to Augustinovich.</p>

<p>Augustinovich went out; in the corridor
Pani Visberg was waiting.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" inquired he, with
concern. "Is some one sick?"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Lula has gone away!" said Pani Visberg,
in a sad voice.</p>

<p>"Long ago?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening. I should have come
here at once, for during the whole week I had
not heard from Yosef, but Malinka was so
afflicted, and had cried so much that I could
not let her come. Lula has gone, she has
gone!"</p>

<p>"Why did she go?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult to tell. Maybe two weeks
from the time that Yosef fell ill, Pelski came
again, and soon after proposed to her a second
time. She experienced no small suffering from
that, for evidently the little man had become
attached to her seriously. Still she refused
him, giving as cause that she could not marry
without attachment. I liked that Pelski well
enough. But that is not the point! The
honest girl refused him, naturally. How much
she suffered during Yosef's sickness! But
that again is not the point. She and Pelski
parted without anger, and he undoubtedly
found her that place in Odessa. Imagine to
yourself my astonishment when a few days ago
she came to me and declared that Yosef's illness
was all that had delayed her departure,
that now, when he was better, she would not be
a burden on me longer, that she wanted to
work for a morsel of bread, and would go.
But, my God! was she a burden to me? Malinka
became educated and acquired polish in
her society; besides, I loved her."</p>

<p>Augustinovich thought awhile; only after
long silence did he say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, kind lady! I understand Lula. When
she took lodgings with you she was a spoiled
and capricious young girl, who thought that
you were receiving her for her coronet, and
to be honored yourself; to-day she is quite
different."</p>

<p>"Do I reproach her with anything?" asked
Pani Visberg.</p>

<p>"That is not a question. I understand how
bitter it must have been for you and your
daughter to part with her, and it is too bad
that you did not let me know of this before.
The person whom Yosef was to marry is no
longer alive."</p>

<p>"No longer alive?"</p>

<p>"She is not. But except pain for you, this
departure will cause no harm. Yosef has not
passed examination for his medical degree; he
must think of that first of all, for it is his bread.
When he recovers and assures a sustenance
for himself, he will go to Odessa after her, but
for that time is needed. Yosef has changed
very much. It is no harm that Lula has done
everything that can raise her still more in his
esteem."</p>

<p>Pani Visberg went away with a straitened
heart. Augustinovich stood awhile on one
spot, then he shook himself from his meditation
and took on a gloomy look.</p>

<p>"She has rejected Pelski a second time,"
thought he; "she wants to work for her living!
Oh, Yosef, Yosef! even to go through greater
suffering than thine&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the thought which he had
begun; he waved his hand, and went to the
chamber.</p>

<p>"What did Pani Visberg want?" asked
Yosef, with an apathetic voice.</p>

<p>"Lula has gone to Odessa," answered
Augustinovich, abruptly.</p>

<p>Yosef closed his eyes and remained motionless
a long time. At last he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a pity! That was a good girl&mdash;Lula."</p>

<p>Augustinovich gritted his teeth and made no
answer.</p>

<hr class="inv" />

<p>The time came at last when Yosef left the
hospital, and a month later he passed his
examination as doctor of medicine. It was
a clear autumnal day. The two friends, with
their diplomas in their pockets, were returning
to the house. Yosef's face bore on it yet the
marks of disease, but otherwise he was perfectly
healthy. Augustinovich walked arm in
arm with him; along the road they talked of
the past.</p>

<p>"Let us sit here on this bench," said Augustinovich
when they entered the garden. "It
is a beautiful day, I like to warm myself in the
sun on such a day."</p>

<p>They sat down. Augustinovich stretched
himself comfortably, drew a long breath, and
said with gladsome feeling,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, old man! we ought to have had in
our pockets for the last three months these
wretched rolls which we have received only
to-day."</p>

<p>"True," replied Yosef, pushing away with
his cane a few yellow leaves that were lying at
the side of the bench.</p>

<p>"The leaves are falling from the trees, and
the birds are moving southward," said Augustinovich.
Then lowering his voice and pointing
to a flock of wagtails flying above the trees, he
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But wilt thou not go south after the
couriers of the sun?"</p>

<p>"I? Whither?"</p>

<p>"To the Black Sea&mdash;to Odessa."</p>

<p>Yosef bent, and remained silent for a long
time, then he raised his head; on his face was
depicted something almost like despair.</p>

<p>"I love her no longer, Adam!" whispered
he.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day Augustinovich
said to Yosef,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We put too much energy into chasing after
woman's love; later on that love flies away
like a bird, and our energy is wasted."</p>

<p class="bookadm">The author of this powerful romance lived in Palestine for over five

for seeing and knowing the people and the country, enabling him to enrich
his story with local color, characteristics, and information not found in any

<p class="bookadm">This second important work from the pen of the successful author of
"Gsta Berling," which has created such a strong impression, will be
widely read. "The author," says a reviewer in "Cosmopolis," "has
chosen the Etna region of Sicily as the theatre of her story, and the result is
a masterpiece of the highest order,&mdash;a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&#339;uvre</i> which places the
young author in the front rank of the literary artists of her day. The
merits of 'Antekrists Mirakler' are so superlative that a lesser eulogy
would be inadequate.... It is worth while to learn Swedish to read this
astonishing book. All who hunger after true poetry may here eat, drink,
and be satisfied."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
