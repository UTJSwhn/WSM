<h2 id='story1' class='c003'>THE HOLY NIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When I was five years old I had such a
great sorrow! I hardly know if I
have had a greater since.</p>

<p>It was then my grandmother died. Up
to that time, she used to sit every day on the
corner sofa in her room, and tell stories.</p>

<p>I remember that grandmother told story after
story from morning till night, and that we children
sat beside her, quite still, and listened. It
was a glorious life! No other children had
such happy times as we did.</p>

<p>It isn’t much that I recollect about my grandmother.
I remember that she had very beautiful
snow-white hair, and stooped when she
walked, and that she always sat and knitted a
stocking.</p>

<p>And I even remember that when she had finished
a story, she used to lay her hand on my
head and say: “All this is as true, as true as
that I see you and you see me.”</p>

<p>I also remember that she could sing songs,
but this she did not do every day. One of
the songs was about a knight and a sea-troll,
and had this refrain: “It blows cold, cold
weather at sea.”</p>

<p>Then I remember a little prayer she taught
me, and a verse of a hymn.</p>

<p>Of all the stories she told me, I have but a
dim and imperfect recollection. Only one of
them do I remember so well that I should be
able to repeat it. It is a little story about
Jesus’ birth.</p>

<p>Well, this is nearly all that I can recall about
my grandmother, except the thing which I remember
best; and that is, the great loneliness
when she was gone.</p>

<p>I remember the morning when the corner
sofa stood empty and when it was impossible
to understand how the days would ever come
to an end. That I remember. That I shall
never forget!</p>

<p>And I recollect that we children were brought
forward to kiss the hand of the dead and that
we were afraid to do it. But then some one
said to us that it would be the last time we
could thank grandmother for all the pleasure
she had given us.</p>

<p>And I remember how the stories and songs
were driven from the homestead, shut up in a
long black casket, and how they never came
back again.</p>

<p>I remember that something was gone from
our lives. It seemed as if the door to a whole
beautiful, enchanted world—where before we
had been free to go in and out—had been
closed. And now there was no one who knew
how to open that door.</p>

<p>And I remember that, little by little, we children
learned to play with dolls and toys, and
to live like other children. And then it seemed
as though we no longer missed our grandmother,
or remembered her.</p>

<p>But even to-day—after forty years—as I sit
here and gather together the legends about
Christ, which I heard out there in the
Orient, there awakes within me the little legend
of Jesus’ birth that my grandmother
used to tell, and I feel impelled to tell it
once again, and to let it also be included in my
collection.</p>

<p>It was a Christmas Day and all the folks had
driven to church except grandmother and I.
I believe we were all alone in the house. We
had not been permitted to go along, because one
of us was too old and the other was too young.
And we were sad, both of us, because we had
not been taken to early mass to hear the singing
and to see the Christmas candles.</p>

<p>But as we sat there in our loneliness, grandmother
began to tell a story.</p>

<p>“There was a man,” said she, “who went
out in the dark night to borrow live coals to
kindle a fire. He went from hut to hut and
knocked. ‘Dear friends, help me!’ said he.
‘My wife has just given birth to a child, and I
must make a fire to warm her and the little one.’</p>

<p>“But it was way in the night, and all the
people were asleep. No one replied.</p>

<p>“The man walked and walked. At last he
saw the gleam of a fire a long way off. Then
he went in that direction, and saw that the fire
was burning in the open. A lot of sheep were
sleeping around the fire, and an old shepherd
sat and watched over the flock.</p>

<p>“When the man who wanted to borrow fire
came up to the sheep, he saw that three big
dogs lay asleep at the shepherd’s feet. All
three awoke when the man approached and
opened their great jaws, as though they wanted
to bark; but not a sound was heard. The man
noticed that the hair on their backs stood up
and that their sharp, white teeth glistened in the
firelight. They dashed toward him. He felt
that one of them bit at his leg and one at his
hand and that one clung to his throat. But their
jaws and teeth wouldn’t obey them, and the man
didn’t suffer the least harm.</p>

<p>“Now the man wished to go farther, to get
what he needed. But the sheep lay back to
back and so close to one another that he couldn’t
pass them. Then the man stepped upon their
backs and walked over them and up to the fire.
And not one of the animals awoke or moved.”</p>

<p>Thus far, grandmother had been allowed to
narrate without interruption. But at this point
I couldn’t help breaking in. “Why didn’t they
do it, grandma?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That you shall hear in a moment,” said
grandmother—and went on with her story.</p>

<p>“When the man had almost reached the fire,
the shepherd looked up. He was a surly old
man, who was unfriendly and harsh toward human
beings. And when he saw the strange man
coming, he seized the long spiked staff, which
he always held in his hand when he tended his
flock, and threw it at him. The staff came right
toward the man, but, before it reached him, it
turned off to one side and whizzed past him,
far out in the meadow.”</p>

<p>When grandmother had got this far, I interrupted
her again. “Grandma, why wouldn’t
the stick hurt the man?” Grandmother did not
bother about answering me, but continued her
story.</p>

<p>“Now the man came up to the shepherd and
said to him: ‘Good man, help me, and lend me
a little fire! My wife has just given birth to
a child, and I must make a fire to warm her
and the little one.’</p>

<p>“The shepherd would rather have said no,
but when he pondered that the dogs couldn’t
hurt the man, and the sheep had not run from
him, and that the staff had not wished to strike
him, he was a little afraid, and dared not deny
the man that which he asked.</p>

<p>“‘Take as much as you need!’ he said to
the man.</p>

<p>“But then the fire was nearly burnt out.
There were no logs or branches left, only a big
heap of live coals; and the stranger had neither
spade nor shovel, wherein he could carry the
red-hot coals.</p>

<p>“When the shepherd saw this, he said again:
‘Take as much as you need!’ And he was glad
that the man wouldn’t be able to take away any
coals.</p>

<p>“But the man stooped and picked coals from
the ashes with his bare hands, and laid them in
his mantle. And he didn’t burn his hands when
he touched them, nor did the coals scorch his
mantle; but he carried them away as if they
had been nuts or apples.”</p>

<p>But here the story-teller was interrupted for
the third time. “Grandma, why wouldn’t the
coals burn the man?”</p>

<p>“That you shall hear,” said grandmother,
and went on:</p>

<p>“And when the shepherd, who was such a
cruel and hard-hearted man, saw all this, he
began to wonder to himself: ‘What kind of a
night is this, when the dogs do not bite, the
sheep are not scared, the staff does not kill, or
the fire scorch?’ He called the stranger back,
and said to him: ‘What kind of a night is this?
And how does it happen that all things show
you compassion?’</p>

<p>“Then said the man: ‘I cannot tell you if
you yourself do not see it.’ And he wished to
go his way, that he might soon make a fire
and warm his wife and child.</p>

<p>“But the shepherd did not wish to lose sight
of the man before he had found out what all
this might portend. He got up and followed
the man till they came to the place where he
lived.</p>

<p>“Then the shepherd saw that the man didn’t
have so much as a hut to dwell in, but that his
wife and babe were lying in a mountain grotto,
where there was nothing except the cold and
naked stone walls.</p>

<p>“But the shepherd thought that perhaps the
poor innocent child might freeze to death there
in the grotto; and, although he was a hard man,
he was touched, and thought he would like to
help it. And he loosened his knapsack from
his shoulder, took from it a soft white sheepskin,
gave it to the strange man, and said that he
should let the child sleep on it.</p>

<p>“But just as soon as he showed that he, too,
could be merciful, his eyes were opened, and he
saw what he had not been able to see before
and heard what he could not have heard before.</p>

<p>“He saw that all around him stood a ring of
little silver-winged angels, and each held a
stringed instrument, and all sang in loud tones
that to-night the Saviour was born who should
redeem the world from its sins.</p>

<p>“Then he understood how all things were so
happy this night that they didn’t want to do
anything wrong.</p>

<p>“And it was not only around the shepherd
that there were angels, but he saw them everywhere.
They sat inside the grotto, they sat outside
on the mountain, and they flew under the
heavens. They came marching in great companies,
and, as they passed, they paused and
cast a glance at the child.</p>

<p>“There were such jubilation and such gladness
and songs and play! And all this he saw
in the dark night, whereas before he could not
have made out anything. He was so happy because
his eyes had been opened that he fell upon
his knees and thanked God.”</p>

<p>Here grandmother sighed and said: “What
that shepherd saw we might also see, for the
angels fly down from heaven every Christmas
Eve, if we could only see them.”</p>

<p>Then grandmother laid her hand on my head,
and said: “You must remember this, for it is
as true, as true as that I see you and you see
me. It is not revealed by the light of lamps
or candles, and it does not depend upon sun and
moon; but that which is needful is, that we have
such eyes as can see God’s glory.”</p>

<h2 id='story2' class='c003'>THE EMPEROR’S VISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It happened at the time when Augustus was
Emperor in Rome and Herod was King in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It was then that a very great and holy night
sank down over the earth. It was the darkest
night that any one had ever seen. One could
have believed that the whole earth had fallen
into a cellar-vault. It was impossible to distinguish
water from land, and one could not find
one’s way on the most familiar road. And
it couldn’t be otherwise, for not a ray of light
came from heaven. All the stars stayed at home
in their own houses, and the fair moon held her
face averted.</p>

<p>The silence and the stillness were as profound
as the darkness. The rivers stood still in their
courses, the wind did not stir, and even the
aspen leaves had ceased to quiver. Had any
one walked along the seashore, he would have
found that the waves no longer dashed upon
the sands; and had one wandered in the desert,
the sand would not have crunched under one’s
feet. Everything was as motionless as if turned
to stone, so as not to disturb the holy night.
The grass was afraid to grow, the dew could
not fall, and the flowers dared not exhale their
perfume.</p>

<p>On this night the wild beasts did not seek
their prey, the serpents did not sting, and the
dogs did not bark. And what was even more
glorious, inanimate things would have been unwilling
to disturb the night’s sanctity, by lending
themselves to an evil deed. No false key could
have picked a lock, and no knife could possibly
have drawn a drop of blood.</p>

<p>In Rome, during this very night, a small company
of people came from the Emperor’s palace
at the Palatine and took the path across the
Forum which led to the Capitol. During the
day just ended the Senators had asked the Emperor
if he had any objections to their erecting
a temple to him on Rome’s sacred hill. But
Augustus had not immediately given his consent.
He did not know if it would be agreeable to
the gods that he should own a temple next to
theirs, and he had replied that first he wished
to ascertain their will in the matter by offering
a nocturnal sacrifice to his genius. It was he
who, accompanied by a few trusted friends, was
on his way to perform this sacrifice.</p>

<p>Augustus let them carry him in his litter, for
he was old, and it was an effort for him to
climb the long stairs leading to the Capitol. He
himself held the cage with the doves for the
sacrifice. No priests or soldiers or senators
accompanied him, only his nearest friends.
Torch-bearers walked in front of him in order
to light the way in the night darkness and behind
him followed the slaves, who carried the
tripod, the knives, the charcoal, the sacred fire,
and all the other things needed for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>On the way the Emperor chatted gaily with
his faithful followers, and therefore none of
them noticed the infinite silence and stillness of
the night. Only when they had reached the
highest point of the Capitol Hill and the vacant
spot upon which they contemplated erecting the
temple, did it dawn upon them that something
unusual was taking place.</p>

<p>It could not be a night like all others, for
up on the very edge of the cliff they saw the
most remarkable being! At first they thought
it was an old, distorted olive-trunk; later they
imagined that an ancient stone figure from the
temple of Jupiter had wandered out on the cliff.
Finally it was apparent to them that it could
be only the old sibyl.</p>

<p>Anything so aged, so weather-beaten, and so
giant-like in stature they had never seen. This
old woman was awe-inspiring! If the Emperor
had not been present, they would all have fled
to their homes.</p>

<p>“It is she,” they whispered to each other,
“who has lived as many years as there are sand-grains
on her native shores. Why has she come
out from her cave just to-night? What does
she foretell for the Emperor and the Empire—she,
who writes her prophecies on the leaves of
the trees and knows that the wind will carry
the words of the oracle to the person for whom
they are intended?”</p>

<p>They were so terrified that they would have
dropped on their knees with their foreheads
pressed against the earth, had the sibyl stirred.
But she sat as still as though she were lifeless.
Crouching upon the outermost edge of the cliff,
and shading her eyes with her hand, she peered
out into the night. She sat there as if she had
gone up on the hill that she might see more
clearly something that was happening far away.
<em>She</em> could see things on a night like this!</p>

<p>At that moment the Emperor and all his
retinue marked how profound the darkness was.
None of them could see a hand’s breadth in
front of him. And what stillness! What silence!
Not even the Tiber’s hollow murmur
could they hear. The air seemed to suffocate
them, cold sweat broke out on their foreheads,
and their hands were numb and powerless.
They feared that some dreadful disaster was
impending.</p>

<p>But no one cared to show that he was afraid,
and everyone told the Emperor that this was
a good omen. All Nature held its breath to
greet a new god.</p>

<p>They counseled Augustus to hurry with the
sacrifice, and said that the old sibyl had
evidently come out of her cave to greet his
genius.</p>

<p>But the truth was that the old sibyl was so
absorbed in a vision that she did not even know
that Augustus had come up to the Capitol. She
was transported in spirit to a far-distant land,
where she imagined that she was wandering
over a great plain. In the darkness she stubbed
her foot continually against something, which
she believed to be grass-tufts. She stooped down
and felt with her hand. No, it was not grass,
but sheep. She was walking between great
sleeping flocks of sheep.</p>

<p>Then she noticed the shepherds’ fire. It
burned in the middle of the field, and she groped
her way to it. The shepherds lay asleep by the
fire, and beside them were the long, spiked
staves with which they defended their flocks
from wild beasts. But the little animals with
the glittering eyes and the bushy tails that stole
up to the fire, were they not jackals? And yet
the shepherds did not fling their staves at them,
the dogs continued to sleep, the sheep did not
flee, and the wild animals lay down to rest beside
the human beings.</p>

<p>This the sibyl saw, but she knew nothing of
what was being enacted on the hill back of her.
She did not know that there they were raising
an altar, lighting charcoal and strewing incense,
and that the Emperor took one of the doves
from the cage to sacrifice it. But his hands were
so benumbed that he could not hold the bird.
With one stroke of the wing, it freed itself and
disappeared in the night darkness.</p>

<p>When this happened, the courtiers glanced
suspiciously at the old sibyl. They believed that
it was she who caused the misfortune.</p>

<p>Could they know that all the while the sibyl
thought herself standing beside the shepherds’
fire, and that she listened to a faint sound which
came trembling through the dead-still night?
She heard it long before she marked that it
did not come from the earth, but from the sky.
At last she raised her head; then she saw light,
shimmering forms glide forward in the darkness.
They were little flocks of angels, who,
singing joyously, and apparently searching, flew
back and forth above the wide plain.</p>

<p>While the sibyl was listening to the angel-song,
the Emperor was making preparations for
a new sacrifice. He washed his hands, cleansed
the altar, and took up the other dove. And,
although he exerted his full strength to hold
it fast, the dove’s slippery body slid from his
hand, and the bird swung itself up into the
impenetrable night.</p>

<p>The Emperor was appalled! He fell upon
his knees and prayed to his genius. He implored
him for strength to avert the disasters
which this night seemed to foreshadow.</p>

<p>Nor did the sibyl hear any of this either. She
was listening with her whole soul to the angel-song,
which grew louder and louder. At last
it became so powerful that it wakened the shepherds.
They raised themselves on their elbows
and saw shining hosts of silver-white angels
move in the darkness in long, swaying lines, like
migratory birds. Some held lutes and cymbals
in their hands; others held zithers and harps,
and their song rang out as merry as child-laughter,
and as care-free as the lark’s trill.
When the shepherds heard this, they rose up
to go to the mountain city, where they lived, to
tell of the miracle.</p>

<p>They groped their way forward on a narrow,
winding path, and the sibyl followed them. Suddenly
it grew light up there on the mountain:
a big, clear star kindled right over it, and the
city on the mountain summit glittered like silver
in the starlight. All the fluttering angel throngs
hastened thither, shouting for joy, and the shepherds
hurried so that they almost ran. When
they reached the city, they found that the angels
had assembled over a low stable near the city
gate. It was a wretched structure, with a roof
of straw and the naked cliff for a back wall.
Over it hung the Star, and hither flocked more
and more angels. Some seated themselves on
the straw roof or alighted upon the steep mountain-wall
back of the house; others, again, held
themselves in the air on outspread wings, and
hovered over it. High, high up, the air was
illuminated by the shining wings.</p>

<p>The instant the Star kindled over the mountain
city, all Nature awoke, and the men who
stood upon Capitol Hill could not help seeing
it. They felt fresh, but caressing winds which
traveled through space; delicious perfumes
streamed up about them; trees swayed; the
Tiber began to murmur; the stars twinkled, and
suddenly the moon stood out in the sky and lit
up the world. And out of the clouds the two
doves came circling down and lighted upon the
Emperor’s shoulders.</p>

<p>When this miracle happened, Augustus rose,
proud and happy, but his friends and his slaves
fell on their knees.</p>

<p>“Hail, Cæsar!” they cried. “Thy genius
hath answered thee. Thou art the god who
shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!”</p>

<p>And this cry of homage, which the men in
their transport gave as a tribute to the Emperor,
was so loud that the old sibyl heard it. It waked
her from her visions. She rose from her place
on the edge of the cliff, and came down among
the people. It was as if a dark cloud had
arisen from the abyss and rushed down the
mountain height. She was terrifying in her
extreme age! Coarse hair hung in matted
tangles around her head, her joints were
enlarged, and the dark skin, hard as the bark
of a tree, covered her body with furrow upon
furrow.</p>

<p>Potent and awe-inspiring, she advanced toward
the Emperor. With one hand she clutched
his wrist, with the other she pointed toward
the distant East.</p>

<p>“Look!” she commanded, and the Emperor
raised his eyes and saw. The vaulted heavens
opened before his eyes, and his glance traveled
to the distant Orient. He saw a lowly stable
behind a steep rock wall, and in the open doorway
a few shepherds kneeling. Within the
stable he saw a young mother on her knees
before a little child, who lay upon a bundle of
straw on the floor.</p>

<p>And the sibyl’s big, knotty fingers pointed toward
the poor babe. “Hail, Cæsar!” cried the
sibyl, in a burst of scornful laughter. “There
is the god who shall be worshiped on Capitol
Hill!”</p>

<p>Then Augustus shrank back from her, as
from a maniac. But upon the sibyl fell the
mighty spirit of prophecy. Her dim eyes began
to burn, her hands were stretched toward
heaven, her voice was so changed that it seemed
not to be her own, but rang out with such
resonance and power that it could have been
heard over the whole world. And she uttered
words which she appeared to be reading among
the stars.</p>

<p>“Upon Capitol Hill shall the Redeemer of
the world be worshiped,—<em>Christ</em>—but not
frail mortals.”</p>

<p>When she had said this, she strode past the
terror-stricken men, walked slowly down the
mountain, and disappeared.</p>

<p>But, on the following day, Augustus strictly
forbade the people to raise any temple to him
on Capitol Hill. In place of it he built a sanctuary
to the new-born God-Child, and called it
<span class='sc'>Heaven’s Altar</span>—<em>Ara Cœli</em>.</p>

<h2 id='story3' class='c003'>THE WISE MEN’S WELL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In old Judea the Drought crept, gaunt and
hollow-eyed, between shrunken thistles and
yellowed grass.</p>

<p>It was summertime. The sun beat down upon
the backs of unshaded hills, and the slightest
breath of wind tore up thick clouds of lime dust
from the grayish-white ground. The herds
stood huddled together in the valleys, by the
dried-up streams.</p>

<p>The Drought walked about and viewed the
water supplies. He wandered over to Solomon’s
Pools, and sighed as he saw that they still held
a small quantity of water from their mountain
sources. Then he journeyed down to the famous
David’s Well, near Bethlehem, and found
water even there. Finally, he tramped with
shuffling gait toward the great highway which
leads from Bethlehem to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>When he had arrived about half-way, he saw
the Wise Men’s Well, where it stands close by
the roadside. He saw at a glance that it was
almost dry. He seated himself on the curb,
which consists of a single stone hollowed out,
and looked into the well. The shining water-mirror,
which usually was seen very near the
opening, had sunk deep down, and the dirt and
slime at the bottom of the well made it muddy
and impure.</p>

<p>When the Well beheld the Drought’s bronzed
visage reflected in her clouded mirror, she shook
with anguish.</p>

<p>“I wonder when you will be exhausted,” said
the Drought. “Surely, you do not expect to
find any fresh water source, down there in the
deep, to come and give you new life; and as for
rain—God be praised! there can be no question
of that for the next two or three months.”</p>

<p>“You may rest content,” sighed the Well,
“for nothing can help me now. It would take
no less than a well-spring from Paradise to save
me!”</p>

<p>“Then I will not forsake you until every drop
has been drained,” said the Drought. He saw
that the old Well was nearing its end, and now
he wanted to have the pleasure of seeing it die
out drop by drop.</p>

<p>He seated himself comfortably on the edge of
the curb, and rejoiced as he heard how the
Well sighed down there in the deep. He also
took a keen delight in watching the thirsty wayfarers
come up to the well-curb, let down the
bucket, and draw it up again, with only a few
drops of muddy water.</p>

<p>Thus the whole day passed; and when darkness
descended, the Drought looked again into
the Well. A little water still shimmered down
there. “I’ll stay here all night,” cried he, “so
do not hurry yourself! When it grows so light
that I can look into you once more, I am certain
that all will be over with you.”</p>

<p>The Drought curled himself up on the edge
of the well-curb, while the hot night, which was
even more cruel, and more full of torment than
the day had been, descended over Judea. Dogs
and jackals howled incessantly, and thirsty cows
and asses answered them from their stuffy stalls.</p>

<p>When the breeze stirred a little now and then,
it brought with it no relief, but was as hot and
suffocating as a great sleeping monster’s panting
breath. The stars shone with the most resplendent
brilliancy, and a little silvery new moon cast
a pretty blue-green light over the gray hills.
And in this light the Drought saw a great caravan
come marching toward the hill where the
Wise Men’s Well was situated.</p>

<p>The Drought sat and gazed at the long procession,
and rejoiced again at the thought of
all the thirst which was coming to the well, and
would not find one drop of water with which
to slake itself. There were so many animals
and drivers they could easily have emptied the
Well, even if it had been quite full. Suddenly
he began to think there was something unusual,
something ghost-like, about this caravan which
came marching forward in the night. First, all
the camels came within sight on a hill, which
loomed up, high and distinct, against the horizon;
it was as though they had stepped straight
down from heaven. They also appeared to be
larger than ordinary camels, and bore—all too
lightly—the enormous burdens which weighted
them.</p>

<p>Still he could not understand anything but
that they were absolutely real, for to him they
were just as plain as plain could be. He could
even see that the three foremost animals were
dromedaries, with gray, shiny skins; and that
they were richly bridled and saddled, with
fringed coverings, and were ridden by handsome,
noble-looking knights.</p>

<p>The whole procession stopped at the well.
With three sharp jerks, the dromedaries lay
down on the ground, and their riders dismounted.
The pack-camels remained standing,
and as they assembled they seemed to form a
long line of necks and humps and peculiarly
piled-up packs.</p>

<p>Immediately, the riders came up to the
Drought and greeted him by laying their hands
upon their foreheads and breasts. He saw that
they wore dazzling white robes and huge
turbans, on the front of each of which there was a
clear, glittering star, which shone as if it had
been taken direct from the skies.</p>

<p>“We come from a far-off land,” said one of
the strangers, “and we bid thee tell us if this
is in truth the Wise Men’s Well?”</p>

<p>“It is called so to-day,” said the Drought,
“but by to-morrow there will be no well here.
It shall die to-night.”</p>

<p>“I can understand this, as I see thee here,”
said the man. “But is not this one of the
sacred wells, which never run dry? or whence
hath it derived its name?”</p>

<p>“I know it is sacred,” said the Drought, “but
what good will that do? The three wise men
are in Paradise.”</p>

<p>The three travelers exchanged glances.
“Dost thou really know the history of this
ancient well?” asked they.</p>

<p>“I know the history of all wells and fountains
and brooks and rivers,” said the Drought, with
pride.</p>

<p>“Then grant us a pleasure, and tell us the
story!” begged the strangers; and they seated
themselves around the old enemy to everything
growing, and listened.</p>

<p>The Drought shook himself and crawled up
on the well-curb, like a story-teller upon his
improvised throne, and began his tale.</p>

<p>“In Gebas, in Media, a city which lies near
the border of the desert—and, therefore, it has
often been a free and well-beloved city to me,—there
lived, many, many years ago, three men
who were famed for their wisdom.</p>

<p>“They were also very poor, which was a most
uncommon state of affairs; for, in Gebas, knowledge
was held in high esteem, and was well
recompensed. With these men, however, it
could hardly have been otherwise, for one of
them was very old, one was afflicted with leprosy,
and the third was a black, thick-lipped
negro. People regarded the first as much too
old to teach them anything; the second they
avoided for fear of contagion; and the third
they would not listen to, because they thought
they knew that no wisdom had ever come from
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the three wise ones became
united through their common misery. They
begged during the day at the same temple gate,
and at night they slept on the same roof. In
this way they at least had an opportunity to
while away the hours, by meditating upon all
the wonderful things which they observed in
Nature and in the human race.</p>

<p>“One night, as they slept side by side on a
roof, which was overgrown with stupefying red
poppies, the eldest among them awoke; and
hardly had he cast a glance around him, before
he wakened the other two.</p>

<p>“‘Praised be our poverty, which compels us
to sleep in the open!’ he said to them. ‘Awake!
and raise your eyes to heaven!’</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Drought, in a somewhat
milder tone, “this was a night which no one
who witnessed it can ever forget! The skies
were so bright that the heavens, which usually
resemble an arched vault, looked deep and transparent
and full of waves, like a sea. The light
surged backwards and forwards and the stars
swam in their varying depths: some in among
the light-waves; others upon the surface.</p>

<p>“But farthest away and highest up, the three
men saw a faint shadow appear. This shadow
traveled through space like a ball, and came
nearer and nearer, and, as the ball approached,
it began to brighten. But it brightened as roses
do—may God let them all wither!—when they
burst from their buds. It grew bigger and
bigger, the dark cover about it turned back by
degrees, and light broke forth on its sides into
four distinct leaves. Finally, when it had descended
to the nearest of the stars, it came to a
standstill. Then the dark lobes curled themselves
back and unfolded leaf upon leaf of beautiful,
shimmering, rose-colored light, until it
was perfect, and shone like a star among stars.</p>

<p>“When the poor men beheld this, their wisdom
told them that at this moment a mighty
king was born on earth: one, whose majesty
and power should rise higher than that of Cyrus
or of Alexander; and they said to one another:
‘Let us go to the father and mother of the
new-born babe and tell them what we have seen!
Mayhap they will reward us with a purse of coin
or a bracelet of gold.’</p>

<p>“They grasped their long traveling staves
and went forth. They wandered through the
city and out from the city gate; but there they
felt doubtful for a moment as they saw before
them the great stretch of dry, smooth desert,
which human beings dread. Then they saw the
new star cast a narrow stream of light across
the desert sand, and they wandered confidently
forward with the star as their guide.</p>

<p>“All night long they tramped over the wide
sand-plain, and throughout the entire journey
they talked about the young, new-born king,
whom they should find reposing in a cradle of
gold, playing with precious stones. They whiled
away the hours by talking over how they should
approach his father, the king, and his mother,
the queen, and tell them that the heavens augured
for their son power and beauty and joy,
greater than Solomon’s. They prided themselves
upon the fact that God had called <em>them</em>
to see the Star. They said to themselves that
the parents of the new-born babe would not
reward them with less than twenty purses of
gold; perhaps they would give them so much
gold that they no longer need suffer the pangs
of poverty.</p>

<p>“I lay in wait on the desert like a lion,” said
the Drought, “and intended to throw myself
upon these wanderers with all the agonies of
thirst, but they eluded me. All night the Star
had led them, and on the morrow, when the
heavens brightened and all the other stars grew
pale, it remained steady and illumined the desert,
and then guided them to an oasis where they
found a spring and a ripe, fruit-bearing tree.
There they rested all that day. And toward
night, as they saw the Star’s rays border the
sands, they went on.</p>

<p>“From the human way of looking at things,”
continued the Drought, “it was a delightful
journey. The Star led them in such a way that
they did not have to suffer either hunger or
thirst. It led them past the sharp thistles, it
avoided the thick, loose, flying sand; they
escaped the burning sunshine and the hot
desert storms. The three wise men said repeatedly
to one another: ‘God is protecting
us and blessing our journey. We are His
messengers.’</p>

<p>“Then, by degrees, they fell into my power,”
said the Drought. “These star-wanderers’
hearts became transformed into as dry a desert
as the one which they traveled through. They
were filled with impotent pride and destructive
greed.</p>

<p>“‘We are God’s messengers!’ repeated the
three wise ones. ‘The father of the new-born
king will not reward us too well, even if he
gives us a caravan laden with gold.’</p>

<p>“By and by, the Star led them over the far-famed
River Jordan, and up among the hills
of Judea. One night it stood still over the little
city of Bethlehem, which lay upon a hill-top, and
shone among the olive trees.</p>

<p>“But the three wise ones looked around for
castles and fortified towers and walls, and all
the other things that belong to a royal city; but
of such they saw nothing. And what was still
worse, the Star’s light did not even lead them
into the city, but remained over a grotto near
the wayside. There, the soft light stole in
through the opening and revealed to the three
wanderers a little Child, who was being lulled
to sleep in its mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Although the three men saw how the Star’s
light encircled the Child’s head, like a crown,
they remained standing outside the grotto. They
did not enter to prophesy honors and kingdoms
for this little One. They turned away without
betraying their presence. They fled from the
Child, and wandered down the hill again.</p>

<p>“‘Have we come in search of beggars as
poor as ourselves?’ said they. ‘Has God
brought us hither that we might mock Him,
and predict honors for a shepherd’s son? This
Child will never attain any higher distinction
than to tend sheep here in the valleys.’”</p>

<p>The Drought chuckled to himself and nodded
to his hearers, as much as to say: “Am
I not right? There are things which are drier
than the desert sands, but there is nothing more
barren than the human heart.”</p>

<p>“The three wise ones had not wandered very
far before they thought they had gone astray
and had not followed the Star rightly,” continued
the Drought. “They turned their gaze
upward to find again the Star, and the right
road; but then the Star which they had followed
all the way from the Orient had vanished from
the heavens.”</p>

<p>The three strangers made a quick movement,
and their faces expressed deep suffering.</p>

<p>“That which now happened,” continued the
Drought, “is in accord with the usual manner
of mankind in judging of what is, perhaps, a
blessing.</p>

<p>“To be sure, when the three wise men no
longer saw the Star, they understood at once
that they had sinned against God.</p>

<p>“And it happened with them,” continued the
Drought furiously, “just as it happens with the
ground in the autumn, when the heavy rains
begin to fall. They shook with terror, as one
shakes when it thunders and lightens; their
whole being softened, and humility, like green
grass, sprang up in their souls.</p>

<p>“For three nights and days they wandered
about the country, in quest of the Child whom
they would worship; but the Star did not appear
to them. They grew more and more bewildered,
and suffered the most overwhelming
anguish and despair. On the third day they
came to this well to drink. Then God had pardoned
their sin. And, as they bent over the
water, they saw in its depths the reflection of the
Star which had brought them from the Orient.
Instantly they saw it also in the heavens and it
led them again to the grotto in Bethlehem,
where they fell upon their knees before the
Child and said: ‘We bring thee golden vessels
filled with incense and costly spices. Thou shalt
be the greatest king that ever lived upon earth,
from its creation even unto its destruction.’</p>

<p>“Then the Child laid his hand upon their
lowered heads, and when they rose, lo! the Child
had given them gifts greater than a king could
have granted; for the old beggar had grown
young, the leper was made whole, and the negro
was transformed into a beautiful white man.
And it is said of them that they were glorious!
and that they departed and became kings—each
in his own kingdom.”</p>

<p>The Drought paused in his story, and the
three strangers praised it. “Thou hast spoken
well,” said they. “But it surprises me,” said
one of them, “that the three wise men do nothing
for the well which showed them the Star.
Shall they entirely forget such a great blessing?”</p>

<p>“Should not this well remain perpetually,”
said the second stranger, “to remind mankind
that happiness, which is lost on the heights of
pride and vainglory, will let itself be found
again in the depths of humility?”</p>

<p>“Are the departed worse than the living?”
asked the third. “Does gratitude die with those
who live in Paradise?”</p>

<p>But as he heard this, the Drought sprang up
with a wild cry. He had recognized the
strangers! He understood who the strangers
were, and fled from them like a madman, that
he might not witness how The Three Wise Men
called their servants and led their camels, laden
with water-sacks, to the Well and filled the poor
dying Well with water, which they had brought
with them from Paradise.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='story4' class='c003'>BETHLEHEM’S CHILDREN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Just outside the Bethlehem gate stood a
Roman soldier, on guard. He was arrayed
in full armor, with helmet. At his side he wore
a short sword, and held in his hand a long
spear. He stood there all day almost motionless,
so that one could readily have believed
him to be a man made of iron. The city people
went in and out of the gate and beggars lolled
in the shade under the archway, fruit venders
and wine dealers set their baskets and jugs down
on the ground beside the soldier, but he scarcely
took the trouble to turn his head to look at
them.</p>

<p>It seemed as though he wanted to say: This
is nothing to see. What do I care about you
who labor and barter and come driving with
oil casks and wine sacks! Let me see an army
prepare to meet the enemy! Let me see the
excitement and the hot struggle, when horsemen
charge down upon a troop of foot-soldiers!
Let me see the brave men who rush forward
to scale the walls of a beleaguered city! Nothing
is pleasing to my sight but war. I long
to see the Roman Eagles glisten in the air! I
long for the trumpets’ blast, for shining weapons,
for the splash of red blood!</p>

<p>Just beyond the city gate lay a fine meadow,
overgrown with lilies. Day by day the soldier
stood with his eyes turned toward this meadow,
but never for a moment did he think of admiring
the extraordinary beauty of the flowers. Sometimes
he noticed that the passers-by stopped to
admire the lilies, and it amazed him to think
that people would delay their travels to look
at anything so trivial. These people do not
know what is beautiful, thought he.</p>

<p>And as he thought thus, he saw no more the
green fields and olive groves round about Bethlehem;
but dreamed himself away in a burning-hot
desert in sunny Libya. He saw a legion of
soldiers march forward in a long, straight line
over the yellow, trackless sand. There was no
protection against the sun’s piercing rays, no
cooling stream, no apparent boundaries to the
desert, and no goal in sight, no end to their
wanderings. He saw soldiers, exhausted by
hunger and thirst, march forward with faltering
step; he saw one after another drop to the
ground, overcome by the scorching heat. Nevertheless,
they marched onward without a murmur,
without a thought of deserting their leader
and turning back.</p>

<p>Now, <em>there</em> is something beautiful! thought
the soldier, something that is worth the glance
of a valiant man!</p>

<p>Since the soldier stood on guard at the same
post day after day, he had the best opportunity
to watch the pretty children who played
about him. But it was with the children as
with the flowers: he didn’t understand that it
could be worth his while to notice them. What
is this to rejoice over? thought he, when he saw
people smile as they watched the children’s
games. It is strange that any one can find pleasure
in a mere nothing.</p>

<p>One day when the soldier was standing at his
accustomed post, he saw a little boy about three
years old come out on the meadow to play. He
was a poor lad, who was dressed in a scanty
sheepskin, and who played quite by himself.
The soldier stood and regarded the newcomer
almost without being aware of it himself. The
first thing that attracted him was that the little
one ran so lightly over the field that he seemed
scarcely to touch the tips of the grass-blades.
Later, as he followed the child’s play, he was
even more astonished. “By my sword!” he
exclaimed, “this child does not play like the
others. What can it be that occupies him?”</p>

<p>As the child played only a few paces away, he
could see well enough what the little one was
doing. He saw how he reached out his hand
to capture a bee that sat upon the edge of a
flower and was so heavily laden with pollen
that it could hardly lift its wings for flight. He
saw, to his great surprise, that the bee let itself
be taken without trying to escape, and without
using its sting. When the little one held the
bee secure between his fingers, he ran over to a
crack in the city wall, where a swarm of bees
had their home, and set the bee down. As soon
as he had helped one bee in this way, he hastened
back to help another. All day long the soldier
saw him catch bees and carry them to their
home.</p>

<p>“That boy is certainly more foolish than
any I’ve seen hitherto,” thought the soldier.
“What put it into his head to try and help
these bees, who can take such good care of
themselves without him, and who can sting him
at that? What kind of a man will he become
if he lives, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The little one came back day after day and
played in the meadow, and the soldier couldn’t
help marveling at him and his games.</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” thought he. “Here I
have stood on guard for fully three years, and
thus far I have seen nothing that could interest
me, except this infant.”</p>

<p>But the soldier was in nowise pleased with
the child; quite the reverse! For this child
reminded him of a dreadful prediction made by
an old Hebrew seer, who had prophesied that
a time of peace should come to this world some
day; during a period of a thousand years no
blood would be shed, no wars waged, but human
beings would love one another like brethren.
When the soldier thought that anything so
dreadful might really come to pass, a shudder
passed through his body, and he gripped his
spear hard, as if he sought support.</p>

<p>And now, the more the soldier saw of the
little one and his play, the more he thought of
the Thousand-year Reign of Peace. He did not
fear that it had come already, but he did not
like to be reminded of anything so hateful!</p>

<p>One day, when the little one was playing
among the flowers on the pretty meadow, a very
heavy shower came bursting through the clouds.
When he noticed how big and heavy the drops
were that beat down upon the sensitive lilies,
he seemed anxious for his pretty friends. He
hurried away to the biggest and loveliest among
them, and bent towards the ground the stiff
stalk which held up the lily, so that the raindrops
caught the chalices on their under side.
As soon as he had treated one flower like this,
he ran to another and bent its stem in the same
way, so that the flower-cups were turned toward
the ground. And then to a third and a
fourth, until all the flowers in the meadow were
protected against the rainfall.</p>

<p>The soldier smiled to himself when he saw
the boy’s work. “I’m afraid the lilies won’t
thank him for this,” said he. “Naturally, every
stalk is broken. It will never do to bend such
stiff growths in that way!”</p>

<p>But when the shower was over, the soldier
saw the little lad hurry over to the lilies and
raise them up. To his utter astonishment, the
boy straightened the stiff stalks without the least
difficulty. It was apparent that not one of them
was either broken or bruised. He ran from
flower to flower, and soon all the rescued lilies
shone in their full splendor in the meadow.</p>

<p>When the soldier saw this, he was seized with
a singular rage. “What a queer child!” thought
he. “It is incredible that he can undertake anything
so idiotic. What kind of a man will he
make, who cannot even bear to see a lily destroyed?
How would it turn out if such a one
had to go to war? What would he do if they
ordered him to burn a house filled with women
and children, or to sink a ship with all souls
on board?”</p>

<p>Again he thought of the old prophecy, and he
began to fear that the time had actually come
for its fulfilment. “Since a child like this is
here,” thought he, “perhaps this awful time is
very close at hand. Already, peace prevails over
the whole earth; and surely the day of war will
nevermore dawn. From this time forth, all peoples
will be of the same mind as this child: they
will be afraid to injure one another, yea, they
will not have the heart even to crush a bee or a
flower! No great deeds will be done, no glorious
battles won, and no brilliant triumvirate will
march up to the Capitol. Nothing more will
happen that a brave man could long for.”</p>

<p>And the soldier—who all the while hoped he
would soon live through new wars and longed,
through daring feats, to raise himself to power
and riches—felt so exasperated with the little
three-year-old that he raised his spear threateningly
the next time the child ran past.</p>

<p>Another day it was neither the bees nor the
lilies the little one sought to protect, but he
undertook something which struck the soldier
as being much more needless and thankless.</p>

<p>It was a fearfully hot day, and the sunrays
fell upon the soldier’s helmet and armor and
heated them until he felt as if he wore a suit
of fire. To the passers-by it looked as if he
must suffer tortures from the heat. His bloodshot
eyes were ready to burst from their sockets,
and his lips were dry and shriveled. But as he
was inured to the burning heat of African deserts,
he thought this a mere trifle, and it didn’t
occur to him to move from his accustomed place.
On the contrary, he took pleasure in showing
the passers-by that he was so strong and hardy
and did not need to seek shelter from the sun.</p>

<p>While he stood thus, and let himself be nearly
broiled alive, the little boy who was wont to
play in the meadow came suddenly up to him.
He knew very well that the soldier was not one
of his friends and so he was always careful not
to come within reach of his spear; but now he
ran up to him, and regarded him long and
carefully; then he hurried as fast as he could
towards the road. When he came back, he
held both hands like a bowl, and carried in this
way a few drops of water.</p>

<p>“Mayhap this infant has taken it upon himself
to run and fetch water for me,” thought the
soldier. “He is certainly wanting in common
sense. Should not a Roman soldier be able to
stand a little heat! What need for that youngster
to run around and help those who require
no help! I don’t want his compassion. I wish
he and all like him were out of the world!”</p>

<p>The little one came walking very slowly. He
held his fingers close together, so that nothing
should be spilled or wasted. All the while, as
he was nearing the soldier, he kept his eyes
anxiously fixed upon the little water which he
brought with him, and did not see that the man
stood there frowning, with a forbidding look
in his eye. Then the child came up to the
soldier and offered him the water.</p>

<p>On the way his heavy blond curls had tumbled
down over his forehead and eyes. He
shook his head several times to get the hair out
of his eyes, so that he could look up. When
he succeeded at last, and became conscious of
the hard expression on the soldier’s face, he was
not frightened, but stood still and begged him,
with a bewitching smile, to taste of the water
which he had brought with him. But the soldier
felt no desire to accept a kindness from the
child, whom he regarded as his enemy. He did
not look down into his pretty face, but stood
rigid and immovable, and showed no sign
that he understood what the child wished to do
for him.</p>

<p>Nor could the child understand that the man
wished to repel him. He smiled all the while
just as confidently, raised himself on the tips of
his toes, and stretched his hands as high as he
could that the big soldier might more easily get
at the water.</p>

<p>The soldier felt so insulted because a mere
child wished to help him that he gripped his
spear to drive the little one away.</p>

<p>But just at that moment the extreme heat
and sunshine beat down upon the soldier with
such intensity that he saw red flames dance before
his eyes and felt his brains melt within
his head. He feared the sun would kill him, if
he could not find instant relief.</p>

<p>Beside himself with terror at the danger hovering
over him, the soldier threw his spear on
the ground, seized the child with both hands,
lifted him up, and absorbed as much as he could
of the water which the little one held in his
hands.</p>

<p>Only a few drops touched his tongue, but
more was not needed. As soon as he had
tasted of the water, a delicious coolness surged
through his body, and he felt no more that the
helmet and armor burnt and oppressed him.
The sunrays had lost their deadly power.
His dry lips became soft and moist again,
and red flames no longer danced before his
eyes.</p>

<p>Before he had time to realize all this, he
had already put down the child, who ran back
to the meadow to play. Astonished, the soldier
began to say to himself: “What kind of water
was this that the child gave me? It was a
glorious drink! I must really show him my
gratitude.”</p>

<p>But inasmuch as he hated the little one, he
soon dismissed this idea. “It is only a child,”
thought he, “and does not know why he acts in
this way or that way. He plays only the play
that pleases him best. Does he perhaps receive
any gratitude from the bees or the lilies? On
that youngster’s account I need give myself no
trouble. He doesn’t even know that he has succored
me.”</p>

<p>The soldier felt, if possible, even more exasperated
with the child a moment later, when
he saw the commander of the Roman soldiers,
who were encamped in Bethlehem, come out
through the gate. “Just see what a risk I have
run through that little one’s rash behavior!”
thought he. “If by chance Voltigius had come
a moment earlier, he would have seen me standing
with a child in my arms.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Commander walked straight
up to the soldier and asked him if they might
speak together there without danger of being
overheard. He had a secret to impart to him.
“If we move ten paces from the gate,” replied
the soldier, “no one can hear us.”</p>

<p>“You know,” said the Commander, “that
King Herod, time and again, has tried to get
possession of a child that is growing up here
in Bethlehem. His soothsayers and priests have
told him that this child shall ascend his throne.
Moreover, they have predicted that the new
King will inaugurate a thousand-year reign of
peace and holiness. You understand, of course,
that Herod would willingly make him—<span class='sc'>Harmless</span>!”</p>

<p>“I understand!” said the soldier eagerly.
“But that ought to be the easiest thing in the
world.”</p>

<p>“It would certainly be very easy,” said the
Commander, “if the King only knew which
one of all the children here in Bethlehem is
<span class='sc'>The One</span>.”</p>

<p>The soldier knit his brows. “It is a pity
his soothsayers can not enlighten him about
this,” said he.</p>

<p>“But now Herod has hit upon a ruse, whereby
he believes he can make the young Peace-Prince
harmless,” continued the Commander. “He
promises a handsome gift to each and all who
will help him.”</p>

<p>“Whatsoever Voltigius commands shall be
carried out, even without money or gifts,” said
the soldier.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” replied the Commander.
“Listen, now, to the King’s plan! He intends
to celebrate the birthday of his youngest son by
arranging a festival, to which all male children
in Bethlehem, who are between the ages of two
and three years, shall be bidden, together with
their mothers. And during this festival——”
He checked himself suddenly, and laughed when
he saw the look of disgust on the soldier’s face.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he continued, “you need not
fear that Herod thinks of using us as child-nurses.
Now bend your ear to my mouth, and
I’ll confide to you his design.”</p>

<p>The Commander whispered long with the soldier,
and when he had disclosed all, he said:</p>

<p>“I need hardly tell you that absolute silence
is imperative, lest the whole undertaking
miscarry.”</p>

<p>“You know, Voltigius, that you can rely on
me,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>When the Commander had gone and the soldier
once more stood alone at his post, he looked
around for the child. The little one played all
the while among the flowers, and the soldier
caught himself thinking that the boy swayed
above them as light and attractive as a butterfly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he began to laugh. “True,” said
he, “I shall not have to vex myself very long
over this child. He shall be bidden to the feast
of Herod this evening.”</p>

<p>He remained at his post all that day, until
the even was come, and it was time to close
the city gate for the night.</p>

<p>When this was done, he wandered through
narrow and dark streets, to a splendid palace
which Herod owned in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>In the center of this immense palace was a
large stone-paved court encircled by buildings,
around which ran three open galleries, one above
the other. The King had ordered that the festival
for the Bethlehem children should be held
on the uppermost of these galleries.</p>

<p>This gallery, by the King’s express command,
was transformed so that it looked like a covered
walk in a beautiful flower-garden. The ceiling
was hidden by creeping vines hung with thick
clusters of luscious grapes, and alongside the
walls, and against the pillars stood small pomegranate
trees, laden with ripe fruit. The floors
were strewn with rose-leaves, lying thick and
soft like a carpet. And all along the balustrades,
the cornices, the tables, and the low
divans, ran garlands of lustrous white lilies.</p>

<p>Here and there in this flower garden stood
great marble basins where glittering gold and
silver fish played in the transparent water.
Multi-colored birds from distant lands sat in
the trees, and in a cage sat an old raven that
chattered incessantly.</p>

<p>When the festival began children and mothers
filed into the gallery. Immediately after they
had entered the palace, the children were arrayed
in white dresses with purple borders and
were given wreaths of roses for their dark,
curly heads. The women came in, regal, in
their crimson and blue robes, and their white
veils, which hung in long, loose folds from high-peaked
head-dresses, adorned with gold coins
and chains. Some carried their children mounted
upon their shoulders; others led their sons by
the hand; some, again, whose children were
afraid or shy, had taken them up in their arms.</p>

<p>The women seated themselves on the floor of
the gallery. As soon as they had taken their
places, slaves came in and placed before them
low tables, which they spread with the choicest
of foods and wines—as befitting a King’s feast—and
all these happy mothers began to eat and
drink, maintaining all the while that proud,
graceful dignity, which is the greatest ornament
of the Bethlehem women.</p>

<p>Along the farthest wall of the gallery, and
almost hidden by flower-garlands and fruit trees,
was stationed a double line of soldiers in full
armor. They stood, perfectly immovable, as if
they had no concern with that which went on
around them. The women could not refrain
from casting a questioning glance, now and then,
at this troop of iron-clad men. “For what are
they needed here?” they whispered. “Does
Herod think we women do not know how to
conduct ourselves? Does he believe it is necessary
for so many soldiers to guard us?”</p>

<p>But others whispered that this was as it should
be in a King’s home. Herod himself never gave
a banquet without having his house filled with
soldiers. It was to honor them that the heavily
armored warriors stood there on guard.</p>

<p>During the first few moments of the feast,
the children felt timid and uncertain, and sat
quietly beside their mothers. But soon they
began to move about and take possession of all
the good things which Herod offered them.</p>

<p>It was an enchanted land that the King had
created for his little guests. When they wandered
through the gallery, they found bee-hives
whose honey they could pillage without the interference
of a single crotchety bee. They found
trees which, bending, lowered their fruit-laden
branches down to them. In a corner they found
magicians who, on the instant, conjured their
pockets full of toys; and in another corner they
discovered a wild-beast tamer who showed them
a pair of tigers, so tame that they could ride
them.</p>

<p>But in this paradise with all its joys there was
nothing which so attracted the attention of these
little ones as the long line of soldiers who stood
immovable at the extreme end of the gallery.
Their eyes were captivated by their shining
helmets, their stern, haughty faces, and their
short swords, which reposed in richly jeweled
sheaths.</p>

<p>All the while, as they played and romped with
one another, they thought continually about the
soldiers. They still held themselves at a distance,
but they longed to get near the men to
see if they were alive and really could move
themselves.</p>

<p>The play and festivities increased every moment,
but the soldiers stood all the while immovable.
It seemed incredible to the little ones
that people could stand so near the clusters of
grapes and all the other dainties, without reaching
out a hand to take them.</p>

<p>Finally, there was one boy who couldn’t restrain
his curiosity any longer. Slowly, but prepared
for hasty retreat, he approached one of
the armored men; and when he remained just
as rigid and motionless, the child came nearer
and nearer. At last he was so close to him that
he could touch his shoe latchets and his shins.</p>

<p>Then—as though this had been an unheard-of
crime—all at once these iron-men set themselves
in motion. With indescribable fury they threw
themselves upon the children, and seized them!
Some swung them over their heads, like missiles,
and flung them between lamps and garlands over
the balustrade and down to the court, where
they were killed the instant they struck the
stone pavement. Others drew their swords and
pierced the children’s hearts; others, again,
crushed their heads against the walls before they
threw them down into the dark courtyard.</p>

<p>The first moment after the onslaught, there
was an ominous stillness. While the tiny bodies
still swayed in the air, the women were petrified
with amazement! But simultaneously all these
unhappy mothers awoke to understand what
had happened, and with one great cry they
rushed toward the soldiers. There were still
a few children left up in the gallery who had
not been captured during the first attack. The
soldiers pursued them and their mothers threw
themselves in front of them and clutched with
bare hands the naked swords, to avert the death-blow.
Several women, whose children were
already dead, threw themselves upon the soldiers,
clutched them by the throat, and sought
to avenge the death of their little ones by
strangling their murderers.</p>

<p>During this wild confusion, while fearful
shrieks rang through the palace, and the most
inhuman death cruelties were being enacted, the
soldier who was wont to stand on guard at the
city gate stood motionless at the head of the
stairs which led down from the gallery. He
took no part in the strife and the murder: only
against the women who had succeeded in snatching
their children and tried to fly down the
stairs with them did he lift his sword. And
just the sight of him, where he stood, grim and
inflexible, was so terrifying that the fleeing ones
chose rather to cast themselves over the balustrade
or turn back into the heat of the struggle,
than risk the danger of crowding past
him.</p>

<p>“Voltigius certainly did the right thing when
he gave <em>me</em> this post,” thought the soldier. “A
young and thoughtless warrior would have left
his place and rushed into the confusion. If I
had let myself be tempted away from here, ten
children at least would have escaped.”</p>

<p>While he was thinking of this, a young
woman, who had snatched up her child, came
rushing towards him in hurried flight. None
of the warriors whom she had to pass could stop
her, because they were in the midst of the struggle
with other women, and in this way she had
reached the end of the gallery.</p>

<p>“Ah, there’s one who is about to escape!”
thought the soldier. “Neither she nor the child
is wounded.”</p>

<p>The woman came toward the soldier with
such speed that she appeared to be flying, and
he didn’t have time to distinguish the features
of either the woman or her child. He only
pointed his sword at them, and the woman, with
the child in her arms, dashed against it. He
expected that the next second both she and
the child would fall to the ground pierced
through and through.</p>

<p>But just then the soldier heard an angry buzzing
over his head, and the next instant he felt
a sharp pain in one eye. It was so intense that
he was stunned, bewildered, and the sword
dropped from his hand. He raised his hand
to his eye and caught hold of a bee, and understood
that that which caused this awful suffering
was only the sting of the tiny creature.
Quick as a flash, he stooped down and picked
up his sword, in the hope that as yet it was
not too late to intercept the runaways.</p>

<p>But the little bee had done its work very
well.</p>

<p>During the short time that the soldier was
blinded, the young mother had succeeded in
rushing past him and down the stairs; and although
he hurried after her with all haste, he
could not find her. She had vanished; and in
all that great palace there was no one who could
discover any trace of her.</p>

<p>The following morning, the soldier, together
with several of his comrades, stood on guard,
just within the city gate. The hour was early,
and the city gates had only just been opened.
But it appeared as though no one had expected
that they would be opened that morning; for no
throngs of field laborers streamed out of the
city, as they usually did of a morning. All the
Bethlehem inhabitants were so filled with terror
over the night’s bloodshed that no one dared to
leave his home.</p>

<p>“By my sword!” said the soldier, as he stood
and stared down the narrow street which led
toward the gate, “I believe Voltigius has made
a stupid blunder. It would have been better
had he kept the gates closed and ordered a
thorough search of every house in the city, until
he had found the boy who managed to escape
from the feast. Voltigius expects that his
parents will try to get him away from here as
soon as they learn that the gates are open. I
fear this is not a wise calculation. How easily
they could conceal a child!”</p>

<p>He wondered if they would try to hide the
child in a fruit basket or in some huge oil cask,
or amongst the grain-bales of a caravan.</p>

<p>While he stood there on the watch for any
attempt to deceive him in this way, he saw a man
and a woman who came hurriedly down the
street and were nearing the gate. They walked
rapidly and cast anxious looks behind them, as
though they were fleeing from some danger.
The man held an ax in his hand with a firm
grip, as if determined to fight should any one
bar his way. But the soldier did not look at
the man as much as he did at the woman. He
thought that she was just as tall as the young
mother who got away from him the night
before. He observed also that she had thrown
her skirt over her head. “Perhaps she wears
it like this,” thought he, “to conceal the fact
that she holds a child on her arm.”</p>

<p>The nearer they approached, the plainer he
saw the child which the woman bore on her
arm outlined under the raised robe. “I’m positive
it is the one who got away last night. I
didn’t see her face, but I recognize the tall
figure. And here she comes now, with the child
on her arm, and without even trying to keep
it concealed. I had not dared to hope for such
a lucky chance,” said the soldier to himself.</p>

<p>The man and woman continued their rapid
pace all the way to the city gate. Evidently,
they had not anticipated being intercepted here.
They trembled with fright when the soldier
leveled his spear at them, and barred their
passage.</p>

<p>“Why do you refuse to let us go out in the
fields to our work?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“You may go presently,” said the soldier,
“but first I must see what your wife has hidden
behind her robe.”</p>

<p>“What is there to see?” said the man. “It
is only bread and wine, which we must live
upon to-day.”</p>

<p>“You speak the truth, perchance,” said the
soldier, “but if it is as you say, why does she
turn away? Why does she not willingly let me
see what she carries?”</p>

<p>“I do not wish that you shall see it,” said
the man, “and I command you to let us pass!”</p>

<p>With this he raised his ax, but the woman laid
her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Enter thou not into strife!” she pleaded.
“I will try some other way. I shall let him
see what I bear, and I know that he can not harm
it.” With a proud and confident smile she
turned toward the soldier, and threw back a fold
of her robe.</p>

<p>Instantly the soldier staggered back and
closed his eyes, as if dazed by a strong light.
That which the woman held concealed under
her robe reflected such a dazzling white light
that at first he did not know what he saw.</p>

<p>“I thought you held a child on your arm,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You see what I hold,” the woman answered.</p>

<p>Then the soldier finally saw that that which
dazzled and shone was only a cluster of white
lilies, the same kind that grew in the meadow;
but their luster was much richer and more radiant.
He could hardly bear to look at them.</p>

<p>He stuck his hand in among the flowers. He
couldn’t help thinking that it must be a child
the woman carried, but he felt only the cool
flower-petals.</p>

<p>He was bitterly deceived, and in his wrath
he would gladly have taken both the man and
the woman prisoners, but he knew that he could
give no reason for such a proceeding.</p>

<p>When the woman saw his confusion, she said:
“Will you not let us go now?”</p>

<p>The soldier quietly lowered the spear and
stepped aside.</p>

<p>The woman drew her robe over the flowers
once more, and at the same time she looked
with a sweet smile upon that which she bore
on her arm. “I knew that you could not
harm it, did you but see it,” she said to the
soldier.</p>

<p>With this, they hastened away; and the soldier
stood and stared after them as long as they
were within sight.</p>

<p>While he followed them with his eyes, he almost
felt sure that the woman did not carry
on her arm a cluster of lilies, but an actual,
living child.</p>

<p>While he still stood and stared after the
wanderers, he heard loud shouts from the street.
It was Voltigius, with several of his men, who
came running.</p>

<p>“Stop them!” they cried. “Close the gates
on them! Don’t let them escape!”</p>

<p>And when they came up to the soldier, they
said that they had tracked the runaway boy.
They had sought him in his home, but then
he had escaped again. They had seen his parents
hasten away with him. The father was a
strong, gray-bearded man who carried an ax; the
mother was a tall woman who held a child concealed
under a raised robe.</p>

<p>The same moment that Voltigius related this,
there came a Bedouin riding in through the
gate on a good horse. Without a word, the
soldier rushed up to the rider, jerked him down
off the horse and threw him to the ground, and,
with one bound, jumped into the saddle and
dashed away toward the road.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Two days later, the soldier rode forward
through the dreary mountain-desert, which is
the whole southern part of Judea. All the while
he was pursuing the three fugitives from Bethlehem,
and he was beside himself because the
fruitless hunt never came to an end.</p>

<p>“It looks, forsooth, as though these creatures
had the power to sink into the earth,” he grumbled.
“How many times during these days
have I not been so close to them that I’ve been
on the point of throwing my spear at the child,
and yet they have escaped me! I begin to think
that I shall never catch up with them.”</p>

<p>He felt despondent, like one who believes he
is struggling against some superior power. He
asked himself if it might not be possible that
the gods protected these people against him.</p>

<p>“This trouble is in vain. Let me turn back before
I perish from hunger and thirst in this barren
land!” he said to himself, again and again.
Then he was seized with fear of that which
awaited him on his home-coming, should he turn
back without having accomplished his mission.</p>

<p>Twice he had permitted the child to escape,
and neither Voltigius nor Herod would pardon
him for anything of the kind.</p>

<p>“As long as Herod knows that one of the
Bethlehem children still lives, he will always
be haunted by the same anxiety and dread,” said
the soldier. “Most likely he will try to ease
his worries by nailing me to a cross.”</p>

<p>It was a hot noonday hour, and he suffered
tortures from the ride through this mountain
district on a road which wound around steep
cliffs where no breeze stirred. Both horse and
rider were ready to drop.</p>

<p>Several hours before he had lost every trace
of the fugitives, and he felt more disheartened
than ever.</p>

<p>“I must give it up,” thought he. “I verily
believe it is time wasted to pursue them
further. They must perish anyway in this awful
wilderness.”</p>

<p>As he thought this, he discovered, in a
mountain-wall near the roadside, the vaulted entrance
to a grotto.</p>

<p>Immediately he rode up to the opening. “I
will rest a while in this cool mountain cave,”
thought he. “Then, mayhap, I can continue the
pursuit with renewed strength.”</p>

<p>As he was about to enter, he was struck with
amazement! On each side of the opening grew
a beautiful lily. The two stalks stood there
tall and erect and full of blossoms. They sent
forth an intoxicating odor of honey, and many
bees buzzed around them.</p>

<p>It was such an uncommon sight in this wilderness
that the soldier did something extraordinary.
He broke off a large white flower and
took it with him into the cave.</p>

<p>The cave was neither deep nor dark, and as
soon as he entered he saw that there were already
three travelers within: a man, a woman,
and a child, who lay stretched out upon the
ground, lost in deep slumber.</p>

<p>The soldier had never before felt his heart
beat as it did at this vision. They were the
three runaways whom he had hunted so long.
He recognized them instantly. And here they
lay sleeping, unable to defend themselves and
wholly in his power.</p>

<p>He drew his sword quickly and bent over the
sleeping child.</p>

<p>Cautiously he lowered the sword toward the
infant’s heart, and measured carefully, in order
to kill with a single thrust.</p>

<p>He paused an instant to look at the child’s
countenance. Now, when he was certain of
victory, he felt a grim pleasure in beholding his
victim.</p>

<p>But when he saw the child his joy increased,
for he recognized the little boy whom he had
seen play with bees and lilies in the meadow beyond
the city gate.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I should have understood
this all the time!” thought he. “This is why
I have always hated the child. This is the
pretended Prince of Peace.”</p>

<p>He lowered his sword again while he thought:
“When I lay this child’s head at Herod’s feet,
he will make me Commander of his Life
Guard.”</p>

<p>As he brought the point of the sword nearer
and nearer the heart of the sleeping child, he
reveled in the thought: “This time, at least,
no one shall come between us and snatch him
from my power.”</p>

<p>But the soldier still held in his hand the lily
which he had broken off at the grotto entrance;
and while he was thinking of his good fortune,
a bee that had been hidden in its chalice flew
towards him and buzzed around his head.</p>

<p>He staggered back. Suddenly he remembered
the bees which the boy had carried to their
home, and he remembered that it was a bee that
had helped the child escape from Herod’s feast.
This thought struck him with surprise. He held
the sword suspended, and stood still and listened
for the bee.</p>

<p>Now he did not hear the tiny creature’s
buzzing. As he stood there, perfectly still, he
became conscious of the strong, delicious perfume
which came from the lily that he held in
his hand.</p>

<p>Then he began to think of the lilies that the
little one had saved; he remembered that it was
a cluster of lilies that had hidden the child from
his view and made possible the escape through
the city gate.</p>

<p>He became more and more thoughtful, and
he drew back the sword.</p>

<p>“The bees and the lilies have requited his
good deeds,” he whispered to himself. Then
he was struck by the thought that the little one
had once shown even him a kindness, and a
deep crimson flush mounted to his brow.</p>

<p>“Can a Roman soldier forget to requite an
accepted service?” he whispered.</p>

<p>He fought a short battle with himself. He
thought of Herod, and of his own desire to
destroy the young Peace-Prince.</p>

<p>“It does not become me to murder this child
who has saved my life,” he said, at last.</p>

<p>And he bent down and laid his sword beside
the child, that the fugitives on awakening should
understand the danger they had escaped.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the child was awake. He
lay and regarded the soldier with the beautiful
eyes which shone like stars.</p>

<p>And the warrior bent a knee before the child.</p>

<p>“Lord, <em>thou</em> art the Mighty One!” said he.
“Thou art the strong Conqueror! Thou art
He whom the gods love! Thou art He who
shall tread upon adders and scorpions!”</p>

<p>He kissed his feet and stole softly out from
the grotto, while the little one smiled and smiled
after him with great, astonished child-eyes.</p>

<h2 id='story5' class='c003'>THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Far away in one of the Eastern deserts many,
many years ago grew a palm tree, which
was both exceedingly old and exceedingly tall.</p>

<p>All who passed through the desert had to stop
and gaze at it, for it was much larger than other
palms; and they used to say of it, that some
day it would certainly be taller than the obelisks
and pyramids.</p>

<p>Where the huge palm tree stood in its solitude
and looked out over the desert, it saw something
one day which made its mighty leaf-crown sway
back and forth on its slender trunk with astonishment.
Over by the desert borders walked
two human beings. They were still at the distance
at which camels appear to be as tiny as
moths; but they were certainly two human beings—two
who were strangers in the desert; for
the palm knew the desert-folk. They were a
man and a woman who had neither guide nor
pack-camels; neither tent nor water-sack.</p>

<p>“Verily,” said the palm to itself, “these two
have come hither only to meet certain death.”</p>

<p>The palm cast a quick, apprehensive glance
around.</p>

<p>“It surprises me,” it said, “that the lions
are not already out to hunt this prey, but I do
not see a single one astir; nor do I see any of the
desert robbers, but they’ll probably soon come.”</p>

<p>“A seven-fold death awaits these travelers,”
thought the palm. “The lions will devour
them, thirst will parch them, the sand-storm will
bury them, robbers will trap them, sunstroke will
blight them, and fear will destroy them.”</p>

<p>And the palm tried to think of something else.
The fate of these people made it sad at heart.</p>

<p>But on the whole desert plain, which lay
spread out beneath the palm, there was nothing
which it had not known and looked upon
these thousand years. Nothing in particular
could arrest its attention. Again it had to think
of the two wanderers.</p>

<p>“By the drought and the storm!” said the
palm, calling upon Life’s most dangerous enemies.
“What is that that the woman carries
on her arm? I believe these fools also bring
a little child with them!”</p>

<p>The palm, who was far-sighted—as the old
usually are,—actually saw aright. The woman
bore on her arm a child, that leaned against her
shoulder and slept.</p>

<p>“The child hasn’t even sufficient clothing on,”
said the palm. “I see that the mother has
tucked up her skirt and thrown it over the child.
She must have snatched him from his bed in
great haste and rushed off with him. I understand
now: these people are runaways.</p>

<p>“But they are fools, nevertheless,” continued
the palm. “Unless an angel protects them, they
would have done better to have let their enemies
do their worst, than to venture into this
wilderness.</p>

<p>“I can imagine how the whole thing came
about. The man stood at his work; the child
slept in his crib; the woman had gone out to
fetch water. When she was a few steps from
the door, she saw enemies coming. She rushed
back to the house, snatched up her child, and
fled.</p>

<p>“Since then, they have been fleeing for several
days. It is very certain that they have not
rested a moment. Yes, everything has happened
in this way, but still I say that unless
an angel protects them——</p>

<p>“They are so frightened that, as yet, they
feel neither fatigue nor suffering. But I see
their thirst by the strange gleam in their eyes.
Surely I ought to know a thirsty person’s face!”</p>

<p>And when the palm began to think of thirst,
a shudder passed through its tall trunk, and the
long leaves’ numberless lobes rolled up, as
though they had been held over a fire.</p>

<p>“Were I a human being,” it said, “I should
never venture into the desert. He is pretty
brave who dares come here without having roots
that reach down to the never-dying water veins.
Here it can be dangerous even for palms; yea,
even for a palm such as I.</p>

<p>“If I could counsel them, I should beg them
to turn back. Their enemies could never be as
cruel toward them as the desert. Perhaps they
think it is easy to live in the desert! But I
know that, now and then, even I have found it
hard to keep alive. I recollect one time in my
youth when a hurricane threw a whole mountain
of sand over me. I came near choking. If I
could have died that would have been my last
moment.”</p>

<p>The palm continued to think aloud, as the
aged and solitary habitually do.</p>

<p>“I hear a wondrously beautiful melody rush
through my leaves,” it said. “All the lobes
on my leaves are quivering. I know not what
it is that takes possession of me at the sight
of these poor strangers. But this unfortunate
woman is so beautiful! She carries me back, in
memory, to the most wonderful thing that I ever
experienced.”</p>

<p>And while the leaves continued to move in a
soft melody, the palm was reminded how once,
very long ago, two illustrious personages had
visited the oasis. They were the Queen of Sheba
and Solomon the Wise. The beautiful Queen
was to return to her own country; the King had
accompanied her on the journey, and now they
were going to part. “In remembrance of this
hour,” said the Queen then, “I now plant a date
seed in the earth, and I wish that from it shall
spring a palm which shall grow and live until
a King shall arise in Judea, greater than Solomon.”
And when she had said this, she planted
the seed in the earth and watered it with her
tears.</p>

<p>“How does it happen that I am thinking of
this just to-day?” said the palm. “Can this
woman be so beautiful that she reminds me of
the most glorious of queens, of her by whose
word I have lived and flourished until this
day?</p>

<p>“I hear my leaves rustle louder and louder,”
said the palm, “and it sounds as melancholy as
a dirge. It is as though they prophesied that
some one would soon leave this life. It is well
to know that it does not apply to me, since I
can not die.”</p>

<p>The palm assumed that the death-rustle in
its leaves must apply to the two lone wanderers.
It is certain that they too believed that their
last hour was nearing. One saw it from their
expression as they walked past the skeleton of
a camel which lay in their path. One saw it
from the glances they cast back at a pair of
passing vultures. It couldn’t be otherwise; they
must perish!</p>

<p>They had caught sight of the palm and oasis
and hastened thither to find water. But when
they arrived at last, they collapsed from despair,
for the well was dry. The woman, worn out,
laid the child down and seated herself beside
the well-curb, and wept. The man flung himself
down beside her and beat upon the dry earth
with his fists. The palm heard how they talked
with each other about their inevitable death. It
also gleaned from their conversation that King
Herod had ordered the slaughter of all male
children from two to three years old, because
he feared that the long-looked-for King of the
Jews had been born.</p>

<p>“It rustles louder and louder in my leaves,”
said the palm. “These poor fugitives will soon
see their last moment.”</p>

<p>It perceived also that they dreaded the desert.
The man said it would have been better if they
had stayed at home and fought with the soldiers,
than to fly hither. He said that they
would have met an easier death.</p>

<p>“God will help us,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“We are alone among beasts of prey and
serpents,” said the man. “We have no food
and no water. How should God be able to
help us?” In despair he rent his garments and
pressed his face against the dry earth. He was
hopeless—like a man with a death-wound in his
heart.</p>

<p>The woman sat erect, with her hands clasped
over her knees. But the looks she cast towards
the desert spoke of a hopelessness beyond
bounds.</p>

<p>The palm heard the melancholy rustle in its
leaves growing louder and louder. The woman
must have heard it also, for she turned her gaze
upward toward the palm-crown. And instantly
she involuntarily raised her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, dates, dates!” she cried. There was
such intense agony in her voice that the old palm
wished itself no taller than a broom and that
the dates were as easy to reach as the buds on
a brier bush. It probably knew that its crown
was full of date clusters, but how should a
human being reach such a height?</p>

<p>The man had already seen how beyond all
reach the date clusters hung. He did not even
raise his head. He begged his wife not to
long for the impossible.</p>

<p>But the child, who had toddled about by himself
and played with sticks and straws, had heard
the mother’s outcry.</p>

<p>Of course the little one could not imagine that
his mother should not get everything she wished
for. The instant she said dates, he began to
stare at the tree. He pondered and pondered
how he should bring down the dates. His forehead
was almost drawn into wrinkles under the
golden curls. At last a smile stole over his
face. He had found the way. He went up
to the palm and stroked it with his little hand,
and said, in a sweet, childish voice:</p>

<p>“Palm, bend thee! Palm, bend thee!”</p>

<p>But what was that, what was that? The
palm leaves rustled as if a hurricane had passed
through them, and up and down the long trunk
traveled shudder upon shudder. And the tree
felt that the little one was its superior. It could
not resist him.</p>

<p>And it bowed its long trunk before the child,
as people bow before princes. In a great bow it
bent itself towards the ground, and finally it
came down so far that the big crown with the
trembling leaves swept the desert sand.</p>

<p>The child appeared to be neither frightened
nor surprised; with a joyous cry he loosened
cluster after cluster from the old palm’s crown.
When he had plucked enough dates, and the
tree still lay on the ground, the child came
back again and caressed it and said, in the
gentlest voice:</p>

<p>“Palm, raise thee! Palm, raise thee!”</p>

<p>Slowly and reverently the big tree raised
itself on its slender trunk, while the leaves played
like harps.</p>

<p>“Now I know for whom they are playing the
death melody,” said the palm to itself when it
stood erect once more. “It is not for any of
these people.”</p>

<p>The man and the woman sank upon their
knees and thanked God.</p>

<p>“Thou hast seen our agony and removed it.
Thou art the Powerful One who bendest the
palm-trunk like a reed. What enemy should
we fear when Thy strength protects us?”</p>

<p>The next time a caravan passed through the
desert, the travelers saw that the great palm’s
leaf-crown had withered.</p>

<p>“How can this be?” said a traveler. “This
palm was not to die before it had seen a King
greater than Solomon.”</p>

<p>“Mayhap it hath seen him,” answered another
of the desert travelers.</p>

<h2 id='story6' class='c003'>IN NAZARETH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Once, when Jesus was only five years old,
he sat on the doorstep outside his father’s
workshop, in Nazareth, and made clay cuckoos
from a lump of clay which the potter across
the way had given him. He was happier than
usual. All the children in the quarter had told
Jesus that the potter was a disobliging man, who
wouldn’t let himself be coaxed, either by soft
glances or honeyed words, and he had never
dared ask aught of him. But, you see, he hardly
knew how it had come about. He had only
stood on his doorstep and, with yearning eyes,
looked upon the neighbor working at his molds,
and then that neighbor had come over from his
stall and given him so much clay that it would
have been enough to finish a whole wine jug.</p>

<p>On the stoop of the next house sat Judas, his
face covered with bruises and his clothes full
of rents, which he had acquired during his continual
fights with street urchins. For the moment
he was quiet, he neither quarreled nor
fought, but worked with a bit of clay, just as
Jesus did. But this clay he had not been able
to procure for himself. He hardly dared
venture within sight of the potter, who complained
that he was in the habit of throwing stones at
his fragile wares, and would have driven him
away with a good beating. It was Jesus who
had divided his portion with him.</p>

<p>When the two children had finished their clay
cuckoos, they stood the birds up in a ring in
front of them. These looked just as clay
cuckoos have always looked. They had big,
round lumps to stand on in place of feet, short
tails, no necks, and almost imperceptible wings.</p>

<p>But, at all events, one saw at once a difference
in the work of the little playmates. Judas’ birds
were so crooked that they tumbled over continually;
and no matter how hard he worked
with his clumsy little fingers, he couldn’t get their
bodies neat and well formed. Now and then
he glanced slyly at Jesus, to see how he managed
to make his birds as smooth and even as
the oak-leaves in the forests on Mount Tabor.</p>

<p>As bird after bird was finished, Jesus became
happier and happier. Each looked more beautiful
to him than the last, and he regarded
them all with pride and affection. They were
to be his playmates, his little brothers; they
should sleep in his bed, keep him company, and
sing to him when his mother left him. Never
before had he thought himself so rich; never
again could he feel alone or forsaken.</p>

<p>The big brawny water-carrier came walking
along, and right after him came the huckster,
who sat joggingly on his donkey between the
large empty willow baskets. The water-carrier
laid his hand on Jesus’ curly head and asked
him about his birds; and Jesus told him that
they had names and that they could sing.
All the little birds were come to him from
foreign lands, and told him things which only
he and they knew. And Jesus spoke in such
a way that both the water-carrier and the
huckster forgot about their tasks for a full
hour, to listen to him.</p>

<p>But when they wished to go farther, Jesus
pointed to Judas. “See what pretty birds Judas
makes!” he said.</p>

<p>Then the huckster good-naturedly stopped
his donkey and asked Judas if his birds also
had names and could sing. But Judas knew
nothing of this. He was stubbornly silent and
did not raise his eyes from his work, and the
huckster angrily kicked one of his birds and
rode on.</p>

<p>In this manner the afternoon passed, and the
sun sank so far down that its beams could come
in through the low city gate, which stood at
the end of the street and was decorated with
a Roman Eagle. This sunshine, which came
at the close of the day, was perfectly
rose-red—as if it had become mixed with blood—and
it colored everything which came in its path,
as it filtered through the narrow street. It
painted the potter’s vessels as well as the log
which creaked under the woodman’s saw, and
the white veil that covered Mary’s face.</p>

<p>But the loveliest of all was the sun’s reflection
as it shone on the little water-puddles which
had gathered in the big, uneven cracks in the
stones that covered the street. Suddenly Jesus
stuck his hand in the puddle nearest him. He
had conceived the idea that he would paint his
gray birds with the sparkling sunbeams which
had given such pretty color to the water, the
house-walls, and everything around him.</p>

<p>The sunshine took pleasure in letting itself
be captured by him, like paint in a paint pot;
and when Jesus spread it over the little clay
birds, it lay still and bedecked them from head
to feet with a diamond-like luster.</p>

<p>Judas, who every now and then looked at
Jesus to see if he made more and prettier birds
than his, gave a shriek of delight when he saw
how Jesus painted his clay cuckoos with the
sunshine, which he caught from the water pools.
Judas also dipped his hand in the shining water
and tried to catch the sunshine.</p>

<p>But the sunshine wouldn’t be caught by him.
It slipped through his fingers; and no matter
how fast he tried to move his hands to get
hold of it, it got away, and he couldn’t procure
a pinch of color for his poor birds.</p>

<p>“Wait, Judas!” said Jesus. “I’ll come and
paint your birds.”</p>

<p>“No, you shan’t touch them!” cried Judas.
“They’re good enough as they are.”</p>

<p>He rose, his eyebrows contracted into an ugly
frown, his lips compressed. And he put his
broad foot on the birds and transformed them,
one after another, into little flat pieces of clay.</p>

<p>When all his birds were destroyed, he walked
over to Jesus, who sat and caressed his birds—that
glittered like jewels. Judas regarded them
for a moment in silence, then he raised his
foot and crushed one of them.</p>

<p>When Judas took his foot away and saw
the entire little bird changed into a cake of
clay, he felt so relieved that he began to laugh,
and raised his foot to crush another.</p>

<p>“Judas,” said Jesus, “what are you doing?
Don’t you see that they are alive and can sing?”</p>

<p>But Judas laughed and crushed still another
bird.</p>

<p>Jesus looked around for help. Judas was
heavily built and Jesus had not the strength to
hold him back. He glanced around for his
mother. She was not far away, but before she
could have gone there, Judas would have had
ample time to destroy the birds. The tears
sprang to Jesus’ eyes. Judas had already
crushed four of his birds. There were only
three left.</p>

<p>He was annoyed with his birds, who stood
so calmly and let themselves be trampled upon
without paying the slightest attention to the
danger. Jesus clapped his hands to awaken
them; then he shouted: “Fly, fly!”</p>

<p>Then the three birds began to move their
tiny wings, and, fluttering anxiously, they succeeded
in swinging themselves up to the eaves
of the house, where they were safe.</p>

<p>But when Judas saw that the birds took to
their wings and flew at Jesus’ command, he began
to weep. He tore his hair, as he had seen
his elders do when they were in great trouble,
and he threw himself at Jesus’ feet.</p>

<p>Judas lay there and rolled in the dust before
Jesus like a dog, and kissed his feet and begged
that he would raise his foot and crush him, as
he had done with the clay cuckoos. For Judas
loved Jesus and admired and worshiped him,
and at the same time hated him.</p>

<p>Mary, who sat all the while and watched
the children’s play, came up and lifted Judas in
her arms and seated him on her lap, and
caressed him.</p>

<p>“You poor child!” she said to him, “you
do not know that you have attempted something
which no mortal can accomplish. Don’t
engage in anything of this kind again, if you do
not wish to become the unhappiest of mortals!
What would happen to any one of us who
undertook to compete with one who paints with
sunbeams and blows the breath of life into dead
clay?”</p>

<h2 id='story7' class='c003'>IN THE TEMPLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Once there was a poor family—a man,
his wife, and their little son—who walked
about in the big Temple at Jerusalem. The son
was such a pretty child! He had hair which
fell in long, even curls, and eyes that shone
like stars.</p>

<p>The son had not been in the Temple since
he was big enough to comprehend what he saw;
and now his parents showed him all its glories.
There were long rows of pillars and gilded
altars; there were holy men who sat and instructed
their pupils; there was the high priest
with his breastplate of precious stones. There
were the curtains from Babylon, interwoven
with gold roses; there were the great copper
gates, which were so heavy that it was hard
work for thirty men to swing them back and
forth on their hinges.</p>

<p>But the little boy, who was only twelve years
old, did not care very much about seeing all
this. His mother told him that that which she
showed him was the most marvelous in all the
world. She told him that it would probably
be a long time before he should see anything
like it again. In the poor town of Nazareth,
where they lived, there was nothing to be seen
but gray streets.</p>

<p>Her exhortations did not help matters much.
The little boy looked as though he would willingly
have run away from the magnificent Temple,
if instead he could have got out and played
on the narrow street in Nazareth.</p>

<p>But it was singular that the more indifferent
the boy appeared, the more pleased and happy
were the parents. They nodded to each other
over his head, and were thoroughly satisfied.</p>

<p>At last, the little one looked so tired and
bored that the mother felt sorry for him.
“Now we have walked too far with you,” said
she. “Come, you shall rest a while.”</p>

<p>She sat down beside a pillar and told him to
lie down on the ground and rest his head on
her knee. He did so, and fell asleep instantly.</p>

<p>He had barely closed his eyes when the wife
said to the husband: “I have never feared anything
so much as the moment when he should
come here to Jerusalem’s Temple. I believed
that when he saw this house of God, he would
wish to stay here forever.”</p>

<p>“I, too, have been afraid of this journey,”
said the man. “At the time of his birth, many
signs and wonders appeared which betokened
that he would become a great ruler. But what
could royal honors bring him except worries
and dangers? I have always said that it would
be best, both for him and for us, if he never
became anything but a carpenter in Nazareth.”</p>

<p>“Since his fifth year,” said the mother reflectively,
“no miracles have happened around
him. And he does not recall any of the wonders
which occurred during his early childhood.
Now he is exactly like a child among other children.
God’s will be done above all else! But
I have almost begun to hope that our Lord in
His mercy will choose another for the great
destinies, and let me keep my son with me.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said the man, “I am certain
that if he learns nothing of the signs and wonders
which occurred during his first years, then
all will go well.”</p>

<p>“I never speak with him about any of these
marvels,” said the wife. “But I fear all the
while that, without my having aught to do
with it, something will happen which will make
him understand who he is. I feared most of
all to bring him to this Temple.”</p>

<p>“You may be glad that the danger is over
now,” said the man. “We shall soon have him
back home in Nazareth.”</p>

<p>“I have feared the wise men in the Temple,”
said the woman. “I have dreaded the soothsayers
who sit here on their rugs. I believed
that when he should come to their notice, they
would stand up and bow before the child, and
greet him as Judea’s King. It is singular that
they do not notice his beauty. Such a child
has never before come under their eyes.” She
sat in silence a moment and regarded the child.
“I can hardly understand it,” said she. “I
believed that when he should see these judges,
who sit in the house of the Holy One and settle
the people’s disputes, and these teachers who
talk with their pupils, and these priests who
serve the Lord, he would wake up and say: ‘It
is here, among these judges, these teachers, these
priests, that I am born to live.’”</p>

<p>“What happiness would there be for him to
sit shut in between these pillar-aisles?” interposed
the man. “It is better for him to roam
on the hills and mountains round about
Nazareth.”</p>

<p>The mother sighed a little. “He is so happy
at home with us!” said she. “How contented
he seems when he can follow the shepherds
on their lonely wanderings, or when he can
go out in the fields and see the husbandmen
labor. I can not believe that we are treating
him wrongly, when we seek to keep him for
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We only spare him the greatest suffering,”
said the man.</p>

<p>They continued talking together in this strain
until the child awoke from his slumber.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the mother, “have you had a
good rest? Stand up now, for it is drawing
on toward evening, and we must return to the
camp.”</p>

<p>They were in the most remote part of the
building and so began the walk towards the
entrance.</p>

<p>They had to go through an old arch which
had been there ever since the time when the
first Temple was erected on this spot; and near
the arch, propped against a wall, stood an
old copper trumpet, enormous in length and
weight, almost like a pillar to raise to the mouth
and play upon. It stood there dented and battered,
full of dust and spiders’ webs, inside and
outside, and covered with an almost invisible
tracing of ancient letters. Probably a thousand
years had gone by since any one had tried to
coax a tone out of it.</p>

<p>But when the little boy saw the huge trumpet,
he stopped—astonished! “What is that?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“That is the great trumpet called the Voice
of the Prince of this World,” replied the
mother. “With this, Moses called together the
Children of Israel, when they were scattered
over the wilderness. Since his time no one has
been able to coax a single tone from it. But
he who can do this, shall gather all the peoples
of earth under his dominion.”</p>

<p>She smiled at this, which she believed to be
an old myth; but the little boy remained standing
beside the big trumpet until she called him.
This trumpet was the first thing he had seen
in the Temple that he liked.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they came to a
big, wide Temple-court. Here, in the mountain-foundation
itself, was a chasm, deep and wide—just
as it had been from time immemorial. This
chasm King Solomon had not wished to fill in
when he built the Temple. No bridge had been
laid over it; no inclosure had he built around
the steep abyss. But instead, he had stretched
across it a sword of steel, several feet long,
sharpened, and with the blade up. And after
ages and ages and many changes, the sword
still lay across the chasm. Now it had almost
rusted away. It was no longer securely fastened
at the ends, but trembled and rocked as soon as
any one walked with heavy steps in the Temple
Court.</p>

<p>When the mother took the boy in a roundabout
way past the chasm, he asked: “What
bridge is this?”</p>

<p>“It was placed there by King Solomon,”
answered the mother, “and we call it Paradise
Bridge. If you can cross the chasm on this
trembling bridge, whose surface is thinner than
a sunbeam, then you can be sure of getting to
Paradise.”</p>

<p>She smiled and moved away; but the boy
stood still and looked at the narrow, trembling
steel blade until she called him.</p>

<p>When he obeyed her, she sighed because she
had not shown him these two remarkable things
sooner, so that he might have had sufficient time
to view them.</p>

<p>Now they walked on without being detained,
till they came to the great entrance portico with
its columns, five-deep. Here, in a corner, were
two black marble pillars erected on the same
foundation, and so close to each other that hardly
a straw could be squeezed in between them.
They were tall and majestic, with richly ornamented
capitals around which ran a row of
peculiarly formed beasts’ heads. And there
was not an inch on these beautiful pillars that
did not bear marks and scratches. They were
worn and damaged like nothing else in the
Temple. Even the floor around them was worn
smooth, and was somewhat hollowed out from
the wear of many feet.</p>

<p>Once more the boy stopped his mother and
asked: “What pillars are these?”</p>

<p>“They are pillars which our father Abraham
brought with him to Palestine from far-away
Chaldea, and which he called Righteousness’
Gate. He who can squeeze between them is
righteous before God and has never committed
a sin.”</p>

<p>The boy stood still and regarded these pillars
with great, open eyes.</p>

<p>“You, surely, do not think of trying to
squeeze yourself in between them?” laughed
the mother. “You see how the floor around
them is worn away by the many who have
attempted to force their way through the
narrow space; but, believe me, no one has
succeeded. Make haste! I hear the
clanging of the copper gates; the thirty
Temple servants have put their shoulders to
them.”</p>

<p>But all night the little boy lay awake in the
tent, and he saw before him nothing but Righteousness’
Gate and Paradise Bridge and the
Voice of the Prince of this World. Never before
had he heard of such wonderful things, and
he couldn’t get them out of his head.</p>

<p>And on the morning of the next day it was
the same thing: he couldn’t think of anything
else. That morning they were to leave for
home. The parents had much to do before they
took the tent down and loaded it upon a big
camel, and before everything else was in order.
They were not going to travel alone, but in
company with many relatives and neighbors.
And since there were so many, the packing naturally
went on very slowly.</p>

<p>The little boy did not assist in the work,
but in the midst of the hurry and confusion he
sat still and thought about the three wonderful
things.</p>

<p>Suddenly he concluded that he would have
time enough to go back to the Temple and take
another look at them. There was still much
to be packed away. He could probably manage
to get back from the Temple before the
departure.</p>

<p>He hastened away without telling any one
where he was going to. He didn’t think it was
necessary. He would soon return, of course.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before he reached the Temple
and entered the portico where the two pillars
stood.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw them, his eyes danced with
joy. He sat down on the floor beside them, and
gazed up at them. As he thought that he who
could squeeze between these two pillars was accounted
righteous before God and had never
committed sin, he fancied he had never seen
anything so wonderful.</p>

<p>He thought how glorious it would be to be
able to squeeze in between the two pillars, but
they stood so close together that it was impossible
even to try it. In this way, he sat motionless
before the pillars for well-nigh an hour;
but this he did not know. He thought he had
looked at them only a few moments.</p>

<p>But it happened that, in the portico where
the little boy sat, the judges of the high
court were assembled to help folks settle their
differences.</p>

<p>The whole portico was filled with people, who
complained about boundary lines that had been
moved, about sheep which had been carried
away from the flocks and branded with false
marks, about debtors who wouldn’t pay.</p>

<p>Among them came a rich man dressed in a
trailing purple robe, who brought before the
court a poor widow who was supposed to owe
him a few silver shekels. The poor widow cried
and said that the rich man dealt unjustly with
her; she had already paid her debt to him once,
and now he tried to force her to pay it again,
but this she could not afford to do; she was so
poor that should the judges condemn her to
pay, she must give her daughters to the rich
man as slaves.</p>

<p>Then he who sat in the place of honor on
the judges’ bench, turned to the rich man and
said: “Do you dare to swear on oath that this
poor woman has not already paid you?”</p>

<p>Then the rich man answered: “Lord, I am
a rich man. Would I take the trouble to demand
my money from this poor widow, if I
did not have the right to it? I swear to you
that as certain as that no one shall ever walk
through Righteousness’ Gate does this woman
owe me the sum which I demand.”</p>

<p>When the judges heard this oath they believed
him, and doomed the poor widow to
leave him her daughters as slaves.</p>

<p>But the little boy sat close by and heard
all this. He thought to himself: What a good
thing it would be if some one could squeeze
through Righteousness’ Gate! That rich man
certainly did not speak the truth. It is a great
pity about the poor old woman, who will be
compelled to send her daughters away to become
slaves!</p>

<p>He jumped upon the platform where the two
pillars towered into the heights, and looked
through the crack.</p>

<p>“Ah, that it were not altogether impossible!”
thought he.</p>

<p>He was deeply distressed because of the poor
woman. Now he didn’t think at all about the
saying that he who could squeeze through
Righteousness’ Gate was holy, and without sin.
He wanted to get through only for the sake
of the poor woman.</p>

<p>He put his shoulder in the groove between
the two pillars, as if to make a way.</p>

<p>That instant all the people who stood under
the portico, looked over toward Righteousness’
Gate. For it rumbled in the vaults, and it sang
in the old pillars, and they glided apart—one
to the right, and one to the left—and made a
space wide enough for the boy’s slender body
to pass between them!</p>

<p>Then there arose the greatest wonder and
excitement! At first no one knew what to say.
The people stood and stared at the little boy
who had worked so great a miracle.</p>

<p>The oldest among the judges was the first one
who came to his senses. He called out that
they should lay hold on the rich merchant, and
bring him before the judgment seat. And he
sentenced him to leave all his goods to the poor
widow, because he had sworn falsely in God’s
Temple.</p>

<p>When this was settled, the judge asked after
the boy who had passed through Righteousness’
Gate; but when the people looked around for
him, he had disappeared. For the very moment
the pillars glided apart, he was awakened, as
from a dream, and remembered the home-journey
and his parents. “Now I must hasten away
from here, so that my parents will not have to
wait for me,” thought he.</p>

<p>He knew not that he had sat a whole hour
before Righteousness’ Gate, but believed he had
lingered there only a few minutes; therefore, he
thought that he would even have time to take
a look at Paradise Bridge before he left the
Temple.</p>

<p>And he slipped through the throng of people
and came to Paradise Bridge, which was situated
in another part of the big temple.</p>

<p>But when he saw the sharp steel sword which
was drawn across the chasm, he thought how the
person who could walk across that bridge was
sure of reaching Paradise. He believed that
this was the most marvelous thing he had ever
beheld; and he seated himself on the edge of
the chasm to look at the steel sword.</p>

<p>There he sat down and thought how delightful
it would be to reach Paradise, and how
much he would like to walk across the bridge;
but at the same time he saw that it would be
simply impossible even to attempt it.</p>

<p>Thus he sat and mused for two hours, but
he did not know how the time had flown. He
sat there and thought only of Paradise.</p>

<p>But it seems that in the court where the
deep chasm was, a large altar had been erected,
and all around it walked white-robed priests,
who tended the altar fire and received sacrifices.
In the court there were many with offerings,
and a big crowd who only watched the
service.</p>

<p>Then there came a poor old man who brought
a lamb which was very small and thin, and
which had been bitten by a dog and had a large
wound.</p>

<p>The man went up to the priests with the lamb
and begged that he might offer it, but they
refused to accept it. They told him that such
a miserable gift he could not offer to our Lord.
The old man implored them to accept the lamb
out of compassion, for his son lay at the point
of death, and he possessed nothing else that
he could offer to God for his restoration. “You
must let me offer it,” said he, “else my prayers
will not come before God’s face, and my son
will die!”</p>

<p>“You must not believe but that I have the
greatest sympathy with you,” said the priest,
“but in the law it is forbidden to sacrifice a
damaged animal. It is just as impossible to
grant your prayers, as it is to cross Paradise
Bridge.”</p>

<p>The little boy did not sit very far away, so
he heard all this. Instantly he thought what
a pity it was that no one could cross the bridge.
Perhaps the poor man might keep his son if
the lamb were sacrificed.</p>

<p>The old man left the Temple Court disconsolate,
but the boy got up, walked over to the
trembling bridge, and put his foot on it.</p>

<p>He didn’t think at all about wanting to cross
it to be certain of Paradise. His thoughts were
with the poor man, whom he desired to help.</p>

<p>But he drew back his foot, for he thought:
“This is impossible. It is much too old and
rusty, and would not hold even me!”</p>

<p>But once again his thoughts went out to the
old man whose son lay at death’s door. Again
he put his foot down upon the blade.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that it ceased to tremble,
and that beneath his foot it felt broad and
secure.</p>

<p>And when he took the next step upon it, he
felt that the air around him supported him, so
that he could not fall. It bore him as though
he were a bird, and had wings.</p>

<p>But from the suspended sword a sweet tone
trembled when the boy walked upon it, and one
of those who stood in the court turned around
when he heard the tone. He gave a cry, and
then the others turned and saw the little boy
tripping across the sword.</p>

<p>There was great consternation among all who
stood there. The first who came to their senses
were the priests. They immediately sent a messenger
after the poor man, and when he came
back they said to him: “God has performed a
miracle to show us that He will accept your
offering. Give us your lamb and we will sacrifice
it.”</p>

<p>When this was done they asked for the little
boy who had walked across the chasm; but
when they looked around for him they could
not find him.</p>

<p>For just after the boy had crossed the chasm,
he happened to think of the journey home, and
of his parents. He did not know that the morning
and the whole forenoon were gone, but
thought: “I must make haste and get back, so
that they will not have to wait. But first I want
to run over and take a look at the Voice of the
Prince of this World.”</p>

<p>And he stole away through the crowd and
ran over to the damp pillar-aisle where the copper
trumpet stood leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>When he saw it, and thought about the prediction
that he who could coax a tone from it
should one day gather all the peoples of earth
under his dominion, he fancied that never had
he seen anything so wonderful! and he sat
down beside it and regarded it.</p>

<p>He thought how great it would be to win
all the peoples of earth, and how much he
wished that he could blow in the old trumpet.
But he understood that it was impossible, so
he didn’t even dare try.</p>

<p>He sat like this for several hours, but he did
not know how the time passed. He thought
only how marvelous it would be to gather all
the peoples of earth under his dominion.</p>

<p>But it happened that in this cool passageway
sat a holy man who instructed his pupils, that
sat at his feet.</p>

<p>And now this holy man turned toward one
of his pupils and told him that he was an impostor.
He said the spirit had revealed to him
that this youth was a stranger, and not an
Israelite. And he demanded why he had
sneaked in among his pupils under a false name.</p>

<p>Then the strange youth rose and said that
he had wandered through deserts and sailed
over great seas that he might hear wisdom and
the doctrine of the only true God expounded.
“My soul was faint with longing,” he said to
the holy man. “But I knew that you would
not teach me if I did not say that I was an
Israelite. Therefore, I lied to you, that my
longing should be satisfied. And I pray that
you will let me remain here with you.”</p>

<p>But the holy man stood up and raised his
arms toward heaven. “It is just as impossible
to let you remain here with me, as it is that
some one shall arise and blow in the huge copper
trumpet, which we call the Voice of the
Prince of this World! You are not even
permitted to enter this part of the Temple. Leave
this place at once, or my pupils will throw themselves
upon you and tear you in pieces, for your
presence desecrates the Temple.”</p>

<p>But the youth stood still, and said: “I do not
wish to go elsewhere, where my soul can find
no nourishment. I would rather die here at
your feet.”</p>

<p>Hardly was this said when the holy man’s
pupils jumped to their feet, to drive him away,
and when he made resistance, they threw him
down and wished to kill him.</p>

<p>But the boy sat very near, so he heard and
saw all this, and he thought: “This is a great
injustice. Oh! if I could only blow in the big
copper trumpet, he would be helped.”</p>

<p>He rose and laid his hand on the trumpet.
At this moment he no longer wished that he
could raise it to his lips because he who could
do so should be a great ruler, but because he
hoped that he might help one whose life was
in danger.</p>

<p>And he grasped the copper trumpet with his
tiny hands, to try and lift it.</p>

<p>Then he felt that the huge trumpet raised
itself to his lips. And when he only breathed,
a strong, resonant tone came forth from the
trumpet, and reverberated all through the great
Temple.</p>

<p>Then they all turned their eyes and saw that
it was a little boy who stood with the trumpet
to his lips and coaxed from it tones which made
foundations and pillars tremble.</p>

<p>Instantly, all the hands which had been lifted
to strike the strange youth fell, and the holy
teacher said to him:</p>

<p>“Come and sit thee here at my feet, as thou
didst sit before! God hath performed a miracle
to show me that it is His wish that thou shouldst
be consecrated to His service.”</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>As it drew on toward the close of day, a man
and a woman came hurrying toward Jerusalem.
They looked frightened and anxious, and called
out to each and every one whom they met:
“We have lost our son! We thought he had
followed our relatives, but none of them have
seen him. Has any one of you passed a child
alone?”</p>

<p>Those who came from Jerusalem answered
them: “Indeed, we have not seen your son, but
in the Temple we saw a most beautiful child!
He was like an angel from heaven, and he has
passed through Righteousness’ Gate.”</p>

<p>They would gladly have related, very minutely,
all about this, but the parents had no
time to listen.</p>

<p>When they had walked on a little farther,
they met other persons and questioned them.</p>

<p>But those who came from Jerusalem wished
to talk only about a most beautiful child who
looked as though he had come down from
heaven, and who had crossed Paradise
Bridge.</p>

<p>They would gladly have stopped and talked
about this until late at night, but the man and
woman had no time to listen to them, and hurried
into the city.</p>

<p>They walked up one street and down another
without finding the child. At last they reached
the Temple. As they came up to it, the woman
said: “Since we are here, let us go in and see
what the child is like, which they say has come
down from heaven!” They went in and asked
where they should find the child.</p>

<p>“Go straight on to where the holy teachers
sit with their students. There you will find the
child. The old men have seated him in their
midst. They question him and he questions
them, and they are all amazed at him. But all
the people stand below in the Temple court,
to catch a glimpse of the one who has raised
the Voice of the Prince of this World to his
lips.”</p>

<p>The man and the woman made their way
through the throng of people, and saw that
the child who sat among the wise teachers was
their son.</p>

<p>But as soon as the woman recognized the
child she began to weep.</p>

<p>And the boy who sat among the wise men
heard that some one wept, and he knew that
it was his mother. Then he rose and came
over to her, and the father and mother took
him between them and went from the Temple
with him.</p>

<p>But as the mother continued to weep, the
child asked: “Why weepest thou? I came to
thee as soon as I heard thy voice.”</p>

<p>“Should I not weep?” said the mother. “I
believed that thou wert lost to me.”</p>

<p>They went out from the city and darkness
came on, and all the while the mother wept.</p>

<p>“Why weepest thou?” asked the child. “I
did not know that the day was spent. I thought
it was still morning, and I came to thee as soon
as I heard thy voice.”</p>

<p>“Should I not weep?” said the mother. “I
have sought for thee all day long. I believed
that thou wert lost to me.”</p>

<p>They walked the whole night, and the mother
wept all the while.</p>

<p>When day began to dawn, the child said:
“Why dost thou weep? I have not sought
mine own glory, but God has let me perform
miracles because He wanted to help the three
poor creatures. As soon as I heard thy voice,
I came to thee.”</p>

<p>“My son,” replied the mother. “I weep
because thou art none the less lost to me. Thou
wilt never more belong to me. Henceforth thy
life ambition shall be righteousness; thy longing,
Paradise; and thy love shall embrace all
the poor human beings who people this earth.”</p>

<p>During one of the latter years of Emperor
Tiberius’ reign, a poor vine-dresser
and his wife came and settled in a solitary
hut among the Sabine mountains. They were
strangers, and lived in absolute solitude without
ever receiving a visit from a human being.
But one morning when the laborer opened his
door, he found, to his astonishment, that an
old woman sat huddled up on the threshold. She
was wrapped in a plain gray mantle, and looked
very poor. Nevertheless, she impressed him as
being so respect-compelling, as she rose and
came to meet him, that it made him think of
what the legends had to say about goddesses
who, in the form of old women, had visited
mortals.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the old woman to the vine-dresser,
“you must not wonder that I have slept
this night on your threshold. My parents lived
in this hut, and here I was born nearly ninety
years ago. I expected to find it empty and
deserted. I did not know that people still occupied
it.”</p>

<p>“I do not wonder that you thought a hut
which lies so high up among these desolate hills
should stand empty and deserted,” said the vine-dresser.
“But my wife and I come from a
foreign land, and as poor strangers we have
not been able to find a better dwelling-place.
But to you, who must be tired and hungry after
the long journey, which you at your extreme age
have undertaken, it is perhaps more welcome
that the hut is occupied by people than by Sabine
mountain wolves. You will at least find a bed
within to rest on, and a bowl of goats’ milk, and
a bread-cake, if you will accept them.”</p>

<p>The old woman smiled a little, but this smile
was so fleeting that it could not dispel the expression
of deep sorrow which rested upon her
countenance.</p>

<p>“I spent my entire youth up here among these
mountains,” she said. “I have not yet forgotten
the trick of driving a wolf from his lair.”</p>

<p>And she actually looked so strong and vigorous
that the laborer didn’t doubt that she still
possessed strength enough, despite her great
age, to fight with the wild beasts of the forest.</p>

<p>He repeated his invitation, and the old
woman stepped into the cottage. She sat down
to the frugal meal, and partook of it without
hesitancy. Although she seemed to be well satisfied
with the fare of coarse bread soaked in
goats’ milk, both the man and his wife thought:
“Where can this old wanderer come from?
She has certainly eaten pheasants served on silver
plates oftener than she has drunk goats’
milk from earthen bowls.”</p>

<p>Now and then she raised her eyes from the
food and looked around,—as if to try and
realize that she was back in the hut. The poor
old home with its bare clay walls and its earth
floor was certainly not much changed. She
pointed out to her hosts that on the walls there
were still visible some traces of dogs and deer
which her father had sketched there to amuse
his little children. And on a shelf, high up, she
thought she saw fragments of an earthen dish
which she herself had used to measure milk in.</p>

<p>The man and his wife thought to themselves:
“It must be true that she was born in this hut,
but she has surely had much more to attend to
in this life than milking goats and making butter
and cheese.”</p>

<p>They observed also that her thoughts were
often far away, and that she sighed heavily and
anxiously every time she came back to herself.</p>

<p>Finally she rose from the table. She thanked
them graciously for the hospitality she had enjoyed,
and walked toward the door.</p>

<p>But then it seemed to the vine-dresser that
she was pitifully poor and lonely, and he exclaimed:
“If I am not mistaken, it was not
your intention, when you dragged yourself up
here last night, to leave this hut so soon. If
you are actually as poor as you seem, it must
have been your intention to remain here for
the rest of your life. But now you wish to
leave because my wife and I have taken possession
of the hut.”</p>

<p>The old woman did not deny that he had
guessed rightly. “But this hut, which for many
years has been deserted, belongs to you as much
as to me,” she said. “I have no right to drive
you from it.”</p>

<p>“It is still your parents’ hut,” said the laborer,
“and you surely have a better right to
it than we have. Besides, we are young and
you are old; therefore, you shall remain and
we will go.”</p>

<p>When the old woman heard this, she was
greatly astonished. She turned around on the
threshold and stared at the man, as though she
had not understood what he meant by his words.</p>

<p>But now the young wife joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>“If I might suggest,” said she to her husband,
“I should beg you to ask this old woman
if she won’t look upon us as her own children,
and permit us to stay with her and take care
of her. What service would we render her if we
gave her this miserable hut and then left her?
It would be terrible for her to live here in this
wilderness alone! And what would she live
on? It would be just like letting her starve
to death.”</p>

<p>The old woman went up to the man and his
wife and regarded them carefully. “Why do
you speak thus?” she asked. “Why are you
so merciful to me? You are strangers.”</p>

<p>Then the young wife answered: “It is because
we ourselves once met with great mercy.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <span class='larger'>II</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is how the old woman came to live in
the vine-dresser’s hut. And she conceived a
great friendship for the young people. But for
all that she never told them whence she had
come, or who she was, and they understood
that she would not have taken it in good part
had they questioned her.</p>

<p>But one evening, when the day’s work was
done, and all three sat on the big, flat rock
which lay before the entrance, and partook of
their evening meal, they saw an old man coming
up the path.</p>

<p>He was a tall and powerfully built man, with
shoulders as broad as a gladiator’s. His face
wore a cheerless and stern expression. The
brows jutted far out over the deep-set eyes, and
the lines around the mouth expressed bitterness
and contempt. He walked with erect bearing
and quick movements.</p>

<p>The man wore a simple dress, and the instant
the vine-dresser saw him, he said: “He is an
old soldier, one who has been discharged from
service and is now on his way home.”</p>

<p>When the stranger came directly before them
he paused, as if in doubt. The laborer, who
knew that the road terminated a short distance
beyond the hut, laid down his spoon and called
out to him: “Have you gone astray, stranger,
since you come hither? Usually, no one takes
the trouble to climb up here, unless he has an
errand to one of us who live here.”</p>

<p>When he questioned in this manner, the
stranger came nearer. “It is as you say,” said
he. “I have taken the wrong road, and now
I know not whither I shall direct my steps. If
you will let me rest here a while, and then tell
me which path I shall follow to get to some
farm, I shall be grateful to you.”</p>

<p>As he spake he sat down upon one of the
stones which lay before the hut. The young
woman asked him if he wouldn’t share their
supper, but this he declined with a smile. On
the other hand it was very evident that he was
inclined to talk with them, while they ate. He
asked the young folks about their manner of
living, and their work, and they answered him
frankly and cheerfully.</p>

<p>Suddenly the laborer turned toward the
stranger and began to question him. “You see
in what a lonely and isolated way we live,”
said he. “It must be a year at least since I
have talked with any one except shepherds and
vineyard laborers. Can not you, who must come
from some camp, tell us something about Rome
and the Emperor?”</p>

<p>Hardly had the man said this than the young
wife noticed that the old woman gave him a
warning glance, and made with her hand the
sign which means—Have a care what you say.</p>

<p>The stranger, meanwhile, answered very
affably: “I understand that you take me for
a soldier, which is not untrue, although I have
long since left the service. During Tiberius’
reign there has not been much work for us
soldiers. Yet he was once a great commander.
Those were the days of his good fortune. Now
he thinks of nothing except to guard himself
against conspiracies. In Rome, every one is
talking about how, last week, he let Senator
Titius be seized and executed on the merest
suspicion.”</p>

<p>“The poor Emperor no longer knows what
he does!” exclaimed the young woman; and
shook her head in pity and surprise.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right,” said the stranger,
as an expression of the deepest melancholy
crossed his countenance. “Tiberius knows that
every one hates him, and this is driving him
insane.”</p>

<p>“What say you?” the woman retorted.
“Why should we hate him? We only deplore
the fact that he is no longer the great Emperor
he was in the beginning of his reign.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said the stranger.
“Every one hates and detests Tiberius. Why
should they do otherwise? He is nothing but
a cruel and merciless tyrant. In Rome they
think that from now on he will become even
more unreasonable than he has been.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened, then, which will
turn him into a worse beast than he is already?”
queried the vine-dresser.</p>

<p>When he said this, the wife noticed that
the old woman gave him a new warning signal,
but so stealthily that he could not see it.</p>

<p>The stranger answered him in a kindly manner,
but at the same time a singular smile played
about his lips.</p>

<p>“You have heard, perhaps, that until now
Tiberius has had a friend in his household on
whom he could rely, and who has always told
him the truth. All the rest who live in his
palace are fortune-hunters and hypocrites, who
praise the Emperor’s wicked and cunning acts
just as much as his good and admirable ones.
But there was, as we have said, one alone who
never feared to let him know how his conduct
was actually regarded. This person, who was
more courageous than senators and generals,
was the Emperor’s old nurse, Faustina.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of her,” said the laborer.
“I’ve been told that the Emperor has always
shown her great friendship.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tiberius knew how to prize her affection
and loyalty. He treated this poor peasant
woman, who came from a miserable hut
in the Sabine mountains, as his second mother.
As long as he stayed in Rome, he let her live
in a mansion on the Palatine, that he might
always have her near him. None of Rome’s
noble matrons has fared better than she. She
was borne through the streets in a litter, and
her dress was that of an empress. When the
Emperor moved to Capri, she had to accompany
him, and he bought a country estate for
her there, and filled it with slaves and costly
furnishings.”</p>

<p>“She has certainly fared well,” said the
husband.</p>

<p>Now it was he who kept up the conversation
with the stranger. The wife sat silent and
observed with surprise the change which had
come over the old woman. Since the stranger
arrived, she had not spoken a word. She had
lost her mild and friendly expression. She had
pushed her food aside, and sat erect and rigid
against the door-post, and stared straight ahead,
with a severe and stony countenance.</p>

<p>“It was the Emperor’s intention that she
should have a happy life,” said the stranger.
“But, despite all his kindly acts, she too has
deserted him.”</p>

<p>The old woman gave a start at these words,
but the young one laid her hand quietingly on
her arm. Then she began to speak in her soft,
sympathetic voice. “I can not believe that
Faustina has been as happy at court as you
say,” she said, as she turned toward the
stranger. “I am sure that she has loved
Tiberius as if he had been her own son. I can
understand how proud she has been of his noble
youth, and I can even understand how it must
have grieved her to see him abandon himself in
his old age to suspicion and cruelty. She has
certainly warned and admonished him every day.
It has been terrible for her always to plead in
vain. At last she could no longer bear to see
him sink lower and lower.”</p>

<p>The stranger, astonished, leaned forward a
bit when he heard this; but the young woman
did not glance up at him. She kept her eyes
lowered, and spoke very calmly and gently.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right in what you say of
the old woman,” he replied. “Faustina has
really not been happy at court. It seems strange,
nevertheless, that she has left the Emperor in
his old age, when she had endured him the span
of a lifetime.”</p>

<p>“What say you?” asked the husband. “Has
old Faustina left the Emperor?”</p>

<p>“She has stolen away from Capri without
any one’s knowledge,” said the stranger. “She
left just as poor as she came. She has not
taken one of her treasures with her.”</p>

<p>“And doesn’t the Emperor really know
where she has gone?” asked the wife.</p>

<p>“No! No one knows for certain what road
the old woman has taken. Still, one takes it
for granted that she has sought refuge among
her native mountains.”</p>

<p>“And the Emperor does not know, either,
why she has gone away?” asked the young
woman.</p>

<p>“No, the Emperor knows nothing of this.
He can not believe she left him because he
once told her that she served him for money
and gifts only, like all the rest. She knows,
however, that he has never doubted her unselfishness.
He has hoped all along that she
would return to him voluntarily, for no one
knows better than she that he is absolutely without
friends.”</p>

<p>“I do not know her,” said the young woman,
“but I think I can tell you why she has left
the Emperor. The old woman was brought up
among these mountains in simplicity and piety,
and she has always longed to come back here
again. Surely she never would have abandoned
the Emperor if he had not insulted her. But
I understand that, after this, she feels she has
the right to think of herself, since her days are
numbered. If I were a poor woman of the
mountains, I certainly would have acted as
she did. I would have thought that I had done
enough when I had served my master during
a whole lifetime. I would at last have abandoned
luxury and royal favors to give my soul
a taste of honor and integrity before it left me
for the long journey.”</p>

<p>The stranger glanced with a deep and tender
sadness at the young woman. “You do not
consider that the Emperor’s propensities will
become worse than ever. Now there is no one
who can calm him when suspicion and misanthropy
take possession of him. Think of this,”
he continued, as his melancholy gaze penetrated
deeply into the eyes of the young woman, “in
all the world there is no one now whom he does
not hate; no one whom he does not despise—no
one!”</p>

<p>As he uttered these words of bitter despair,
the old woman made a sudden movement and
turned toward him, but the young woman looked
him straight in the eyes and answered: “Tiberius
knows that Faustina will come back to
him whenever he wishes it. But first she must
know that her old eyes need never more behold
vice and infamy at his court.”</p>

<p>They had all risen during this speech; but the
vine-dresser and his wife placed themselves in
front of the old woman, as if to shield her.</p>

<p>The stranger did not utter another syllable,
but regarded the old woman with a questioning
glance. Is this <em>your</em> last word also? he seemed
to want to say. The old woman’s lips quivered,
but words would not pass them.</p>

<p>“If the Emperor has loved his old servant,
then he can also let her live her last days in
peace,” said the young woman.</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated still, but suddenly his
dark countenance brightened. “My friends,”
said he, “whatever one may say of Tiberius,
there is one thing which he has learned better
than others; and that is—renunciation. I have
only one thing more to say to you: If this old
woman, of whom we have spoken, should come
to this hut, receive her well! The Emperor’s
favor rests upon any one who succors her.”</p>

<p>He wrapped his mantle about him and departed
the same way that he had come.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <span class='larger'>III</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After this, the vine-dresser and his wife never
again spoke to the old woman about the Emperor.
Between themselves they marveled that
she, at her great age, had had the strength
to renounce all the wealth and power to which
she had become accustomed. “I wonder if she
will not soon go back to Tiberius?” they asked
themselves. “It is certain that she still loves
him. It is in the hope that it will awaken him
to reason and enable him to repent of his low
conduct, that she has left him.”</p>

<p>“A man as old as the Emperor will never
begin a new life,” said the laborer. “How are
you going to rid him of his great contempt for
mankind? Who could go to him and teach him
to love his fellow man? Until this happens, he
can not be cured of suspicion and cruelty.”</p>

<p>“You know that there is one who could
actually do it,” said the wife. “I often think
of how it would turn out, if the two should
meet. But God’s ways are not our ways.”</p>

<p>The old woman did not seem to miss her
former life at all. After a time the young wife
gave birth to a child. The old woman had the
care of it; she seemed so content in consequence
that one could have thought she had forgotten
all her sorrows.</p>

<p>Once every half-year she used to wrap her
long, gray mantle around her, and wander down
to Rome. There she did not seek a soul, but
went straight to the Forum. Here she stopped
outside a little temple, which was erected on
one side of the superbly decorated square.</p>

<p>All there was of this temple was an uncommonly
large altar, which stood in a marble-paved
court under the open sky. On the top
of the altar, Fortuna, the goddess of happiness,
was enthroned, and at its foot was a statue of
Tiberius. Encircling the court were buildings
for the priests, storerooms for fuel, and stalls
for the beasts of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Old Faustina’s journeys never extended beyond
this temple, where those who would pray
for the welfare of Tiberius were wont to come.
When she cast a glance in there and saw that
both the goddess’ and the Emperor’s statue
were wreathed in flowers; that the sacrificial fire
burned; that throngs of reverent worshipers
were assembled before the altar, and heard the
priests’ low chants sounding thereabouts, she
turned around and went back to the mountains.</p>

<p>In this way she learned, without having to
question a human being, that Tiberius was still
among the living, and that all was well with
him.</p>

<p>The third time she undertook this journey,
she met with a surprise. When she reached the
little temple, she found it empty and deserted.
No fire burned before the statue, and not a
worshiper was seen. A couple of dried garlands
still hung on one side of the altar, but this
was all that testified to its former glory. The
priests were gone, and the Emperor’s statue,
which stood there unguarded, was damaged and
mud-bespattered.</p>

<p>The old woman turned to the first passer-by.
“What does this mean?” she asked. “Is Tiberius
dead? Have we another Emperor?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the Roman, “Tiberius is still
Emperor, but we have ceased to pray for him.
Our prayers can no longer benefit him.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the old woman, “I live
far away among the mountains, where one learns
nothing of what happens out in the world.
Won’t you tell me what dreadful misfortune
has overtaken the Emperor?”</p>

<p>“The most dreadful of all misfortunes! He
has been stricken with a disease which has never
before been known in Italy, but which seems to
be common in the Orient. Since this evil has
befallen the Emperor, his features are changed,
his voice has become like an animal’s grunt, and
his toes and fingers are rotting away. And for
this illness there appears to be no remedy. They
believe that he will die within a few weeks. But
if he does not die, he will be dethroned, for
such an ill and wretched man can no longer conduct
the affairs of State. You understand, of
course, that his fate is a foregone conclusion.
It is useless to invoke the gods for his success,
and it is not worth while,” he added, with a
faint smile. “No one has anything more
either to fear or hope from him. Why,
then, should we trouble ourselves on his
account?”</p>

<p>He nodded and walked away; but the old
woman stood there as if stunned.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life she collapsed, and
looked like one whom age has subdued. She
stood with bent back and trembling head, and
with hands that groped feebly in the air.</p>

<p>She longed to get away from the place, but
she moved her feet slowly. She looked around
to find something which she could use as a staff.</p>

<p>But after a few moments, by a tremendous
effort of the will, she succeeded in conquering
the faintness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>

  </div>
</div>

<p>A week later, old Faustina wandered up the
steep inclines on the Island of Capri. It was
a warm day and the dread consciousness of old
age and feebleness came over her as she labored
up the winding roads and the hewn-out steps
in the mountain, which led to Tiberius’ villa.</p>

<p>This feeling increased when she observed how
changed everything had become during the time
she had been away. In truth, on and alongside
these steps there had always before been throngs
of people. Here it used fairly to swarm with
senators, borne by giant Libyans; with messengers
from the provinces attended by long
processions of slaves; with office-seekers; with
noblemen invited to participate in the Emperor’s
feasts.</p>

<p>But to-day the steps and passages were entirely
deserted. Gray-greenish lizards were the
only living things which the old woman saw in
her path.</p>

<p>She was amazed to see that already everything
appeared to be going to ruin. At most, the
Emperor’s illness could not have progressed
more than two months, and yet the grass had
already taken root in the cracks between the
marble stones. Rare growths, planted in beautiful
vases, were already withered and here and
there mischievous spoilers, whom no one had
taken the trouble to stop, had broken down the
balustrade.</p>

<p>But to her the most singular thing of all
was the entire absence of people. Even if
strangers were forbidden to appear on the
island, attendants at least should still be found
there: the endless crowds of soldiers and slaves;
of dancers and musicians; of cooks and stewards;
of palace-sentinels and gardeners, who belonged
to the Emperor’s household.</p>

<p>When Faustina reached the upper terrace, she
caught sight of two slaves, who sat on the steps
in front of the villa. As she approached, they
rose and bowed to her.</p>

<p>“Be greeted, Faustina!” said one of them.
“It is a god who sends thee to lighten our
sorrows.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Milo?” asked Faustina.
“Why is it so deserted here? Yet they
have told me that Tiberius still lives at Capri.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor has driven away all his slaves
because he suspects that one of us has given
him poisoned wine to drink, and that this has
brought on the illness. He would have driven
even Tito and myself away, if we had not refused
to obey him; yet, as you know, we have all
our lives served the Emperor and his mother.”</p>

<p>“I do not ask after slaves only,” said
Faustina. “Where are the senators and field marshals?
Where are the Emperor’s intimate
friends, and all the fawning fortune-hunters?”</p>

<p>“Tiberius does not wish to show himself
before strangers,” said the slave. “Senator
Lucius and Marco, Commander of the Life
Guard, come here every day and receive orders.
No one else may approach him.”</p>

<p>Faustina had gone up the steps to enter the
villa. The slave went before her, and on the
way she asked: “What say the physicians of
Tiberius’ illness?”</p>

<p>“None of them understands how to treat this
illness. They do not even know if it kills quickly
or slowly. But this I can tell you, Faustina,
Tiberius must die if he continues to refuse all
food for fear it may be poisoned. And I know
that a sick man can not stay awake night and
day, as the Emperor does, for fear he may be
murdered in his sleep. If he will trust you as in
former days, you might succeed in making him
eat and sleep. Thereby you can prolong his
life for many days.”</p>

<p>The slave conducted Faustina through several
passages and courts to a terrace which Tiberius
used to frequent to enjoy the view of the beautiful
bays and proud Vesuvius.</p>

<p>When Faustina stepped out upon the terrace,
she saw a hideous creature with a swollen face
and animal-like features. His hands and feet
were swathed in white bandages, but through
the bandages protruded half-rotted fingers and
toes. And this being’s clothes were soiled and
dusty. It was evident he could not walk erect,
but had been obliged to crawl out upon the
terrace. He lay with closed eyes near the balustrade
at the farthest end, and did not move
when the slave and Faustina came.</p>

<p>Faustina whispered to the slave, who walked
before her: “But, Milo, how can such a creature
be found here on the Emperor’s private terrace?
Make haste, and take him away!”</p>

<p>But she had scarcely said this when she saw
the slave bow to the ground before the miserable
creature who lay there.</p>

<p>“Cæsar Tiberius,” said he, “at last I have
glad tidings to bring thee.”</p>

<p>At the same time the slave turned toward
Faustina, but he shrank back, aghast! and could
not speak another word.</p>

<p>He did not behold the proud matron who had
looked so strong that one might have expected
that she would live to the age of a sibyl. In
this moment, she had drooped into impotent
age, and the slave saw before him a bent old
woman with misty eyes and fumbling hands.</p>

<p>Faustina had certainly heard that the Emperor
was terribly changed, yet never for a
moment had she ceased to think of him as
the strong man he was when she last saw him.
She had also heard some one say that this
illness progressed slowly, and that it took years
to transform a human being. But here it had
advanced with such virulence that it had made
the Emperor unrecognizable in just two months.</p>

<p>She tottered up to the Emperor. She could
not speak, but stood silent beside him, and
wept.</p>

<p>“Are you come now, Faustina?” he said,
without opening his eyes. “I lay and fancied
that you stood here and wept over me. I dare
not look up for fear I will find that it was only
an illusion.”</p>

<p>Then the old woman sat down beside him.
She raised his head and placed it on her
knee.</p>

<p>But Tiberius lay still, without looking at her.
A sense of sweet repose enfolded him, and the
next moment he sank into a peaceful slumber.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <span class='larger'>V</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A few weeks later, one of the Emperor’s
slaves came to the lonely hut in the Sabine mountains.
It drew on toward evening, and the vine-dresser
and his wife stood in the doorway and
saw the sun set in the distant west. The slave
turned out of the path, and came up and greeted
them. Thereupon he took a heavy purse, which
he carried in his girdle, and laid it in the husband’s
hand.</p>

<p>“This, Faustina, the old woman to whom
you have shown compassion, sends you,” said
the slave. “She begs that with this money
you will purchase a vineyard of your own, and
build you a house that does not lie as high in
the air as the eagles’ nests.”</p>

<p>“Old Faustina still lives, then?” said the
husband. “We have searched for her in cleft
and morass. When she did not come back
to us, I thought that she had met her death in
these wretched mountains.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember,” the wife interposed,
“that I would not believe that she was dead?
Did I not say to you that she had gone back
to the Emperor?”</p>

<p>This the husband admitted. “And I am
glad,” he added, “that you were right, not
only because Faustina has become rich enough
to help us out of our poverty, but also on
the poor Emperor’s account.”</p>

<p>The slave wanted to say farewell at once, in
order to reach densely settled quarters before
dark, but this the couple would not permit.
“You must stop with us until morning,” said
they. “We can not let you go before you
have told us all that has happened to Faustina.
Why has she returned to the Emperor? What
was their meeting like? Are they glad to be
together again?”</p>

<p>The slave yielded to these solicitations. He
followed them into the hut, and during the
evening meal he told them all about the Emperor’s
illness and Faustina’s return.</p>

<p>When the slave had finished his narrative,
he saw that both the man and the woman sat
motionless—dumb with amazement. Their gaze
was fixed on the ground, as though not to betray
the emotion which affected them.</p>

<p>Finally the man looked up and said to his
wife: “Don’t you believe God has decreed
this?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the wife, “surely it was for this
that our Lord sent us across the sea to this lonely
hut. Surely this was His purpose when He
sent the old woman to our door.”</p>

<p>As soon as the wife had spoken these words,
the vine-dresser turned again to the slave.</p>

<p>“Friend!” he said to him, “you shall carry
a message from me to Faustina. Tell her this
word for word! Thus your friend the vineyard
laborer from the Sabine mountains greets you.
You have seen the young woman, my wife. Did
she not appear fair to you, and blooming with
health? And yet this young woman once
suffered from the same disease which now has
stricken Tiberius.”</p>

<p>The slave made a gesture of surprise, but the
vine-dresser continued with greater emphasis on
his words.</p>

<p>“If Faustina refuses to believe my word, tell
her that my wife and I came from Palestine,
in Asia, a land where this disease is common.
There the law is such that the lepers are driven
from the cities and towns, and must live in tombs
and mountain grottoes. Tell Faustina that my
wife was born of diseased parents in a mountain
grotto. As long as she was a child she was
healthy, but when she grew up into young
maidenhood she was stricken with the disease.”</p>

<p>The slave bowed, smiled pleasantly, and said:
“How can you expect that Faustina will believe
this? She has seen your wife in her beauty
and health. And she must know that there is
no remedy for this illness.”</p>

<p>The man replied: “It were best for her that
she believed me. But I am not without witnesses.
She can send inquiries over to Nazareth,
in Galilee. There every one will confirm my
statement.”</p>

<p>“Is it perchance through a miracle of some
god that your wife has been cured?” asked the
slave.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is as you say,” answered the laborer.
“One day a rumor reached the sick who lived
in the wilderness: ‘Behold, a great Prophet has
arisen in Nazareth of Galilee. He is filled with
the power of God’s spirit, and he can cure your
illness just by laying his hand upon your forehead!’
But the sick, who lay in their misery,
would not believe that this rumor was the truth.
‘No one can heal us,’ they said. ‘Since the
days of the great prophets no one has been able
to save one of us from this misfortune.’</p>

<p>“But there was one amongst them who believed,
and that was a young maiden. She left
the others to seek her way to the city of Nazareth,
where the Prophet lived. One day, when
she wandered over wide plains, she met a man
tall of stature, with a pale face and hair which
lay in even, black curls. His dark eyes shone
like stars and drew her toward him. But before
they met, she called out to him: ‘Come
not near me, for I am unclean, but tell me where
I can find the Prophet from Nazareth!’ But
the man continued to walk towards her, and
when he stood directly in front of her, he said:
‘Why seekest thou the Prophet of Nazareth?’—‘I
seek him that he may lay his hand on my
forehead and heal me of my illness.’ Then
the man went up and laid his hand upon her
brow. But she said to him: ‘What doth it avail
me that you lay your hand upon my forehead?
You surely are no prophet?’ Then he smiled
on her and said: ‘Go now into the city which
lies yonder at the foot of the mountain, and
show thyself before the priests!’</p>

<p>“The sick maiden thought to herself: ‘He
mocks me because I believe I can be healed.
From him I can not learn what I would know.’
And she went farther. Soon thereafter she saw
a man, who was going out to hunt, riding across
the wide field. When he came so near that
he could hear her, she called to him: ‘Come
not close to me, I am unclean! But tell me
where I can find the Prophet of Nazareth!’
‘What do you want of the Prophet?’ asked the
man, riding slowly toward her. ‘I wish only
that he might lay his hand on my forehead and
heal me of my illness.’ The man rode still
nearer. ‘Of what illness do you wish to be
healed?’ said he. ‘Surely you need no physician!’
‘Can’t you see that I am a leper?’
said she. ‘I was born of diseased parents in a
mountain grotto.’ But the man continued to
approach, for she was beautiful and fair, like
a new-blown rose. ‘You are the most beautiful
maiden in Judea!’ he exclaimed. ‘Ah,
taunt me not—you, too!’ said she. ‘I know
that my features are destroyed, and that my
voice is like a wild beast’s growl.’</p>

<p>“He looked deep into her eyes and said to
her: ‘Your voice is as resonant as the spring
brook’s when it ripples over pebbles, and your
face is as smooth as a coverlet of soft satin.’</p>

<p>“That moment he rode so close to her that
she could see her face in the shining mountings
which decorated his saddle. ‘You shall look
at yourself here,’ said he. She did so, and saw
a face smooth and soft as a newly-formed butterfly
wing. ‘What is this that I see?’ she said.
‘This is not my face!’ ‘Yes, it is your face,’
said the rider. ‘But my voice, is it not rough?
Does it not sound as when wagons are drawn
over a stony road?’ ‘No! It sounds like a
zither player’s sweetest songs,’ said the rider.</p>

<p>“She turned and pointed toward the road.
‘Do you know who that man is just disappearing
behind the two oaks?’ she asked.</p>

<p>“‘It is he whom you lately asked after; it is
the Prophet from Nazareth,’ said the man.
Then she clasped her hands in astonishment,
and tears filled her eyes. ‘Oh, thou Holy One!
Oh, thou Messenger of God’s power!’ she
cried. Thou hast healed me!’</p>

<p>“Then the rider lifted her into the saddle
and bore her to the city at the foot of the
mountain and went with her to the priests and
elders, and told them how he had found her.
They questioned her carefully; but when they
heard that the maiden was born in the wilderness
of diseased parents, they would not believe
that she was healed. ‘Go back thither whence
you came!’ said they. ‘If you have been ill,
you must remain so as long as you live. You
must not come here to the city, to infect the
rest of us with your disease.’</p>

<p>“She said to them: ‘I know that I am well,
for the Prophet from Nazareth hath laid his
hand upon my forehead.’</p>

<p>“When they heard this they exclaimed:
‘Who is he, that he should be able to make
clean the unclean? All this is but a delusion
of the evil spirits. Go back to your own, that
you may not bring destruction upon all of us!’</p>

<p>“They would not declare her healed, and
they forbade her to remain in the city. They
decreed that each and every one who gave her
shelter should also be adjudged unclean.</p>

<p>“When the priests had pronounced this judgment,
the young maiden turned to the man who
had found her in the field: ‘Whither shall I
go now? Must I go back again to the lepers
in the wilderness?’</p>

<p>“But the man lifted her once more upon his
horse, and said to her: ‘No, under no conditions
shall you go out to the lepers in their
mountain caves, but we two shall travel across
the sea to another land, where there are no
laws for clean and unclean.’ And they——”</p>

<p>But when the vineyard laborer had got thus
far in his narrative, the slave arose and interrupted
him. “You need not tell any more,”
said he. “Stand up rather and follow me on
the way, you who know the mountains, so that
I can begin my home journey to-night, and not
wait until morning. The Emperor and Faustina
can not hear your tidings a moment too soon.”</p>

<p>When the vine-dresser had accompanied the
slave, and come home again to the hut, he found
his wife still awake.</p>

<p>“I can not sleep,” said she. “I am thinking
that these two will meet: he who loves all
mankind, and he who hates them. Such a
meeting would be enough to sweep the earth out
of existence!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <span class='larger'>VI</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Old Faustina was in distant Palestine, on her
way to Jerusalem. She had not desired that
the mission to seek the Prophet and bring him
to the Emperor should be intrusted to any one
but herself. She said to herself: “That which
we demand of this stranger, is something which
we can not coax from him either by force
or bribes. But perhaps he will grant it us if
some one falls at his feet and tells him in
what dire need the Emperor is. Who can make
an honest plea for Tiberius, but the one who
suffers from his misfortune as much as he
does?”</p>

<p>The hope of possibly saving Tiberius had
renewed the old woman’s youth. She withstood
without difficulty the long sea trip to
Joppa, and on the journey to Jerusalem she
made no use of a litter, but rode a horse. She
appeared to stand the difficult ride as easily
as the Roman nobles, the soldiers, and the slaves
who made up her retinue.</p>

<p>The journey from Joppa to Jerusalem filled
the old woman’s heart with joy and bright
hopes. It was springtime, and Sharon’s plain,
over which they had ridden during the first
day’s travel, had been a brilliant carpet of
flowers. Even during the second day’s journey,
when they came to the hills of Judea, they were
not abandoned by the flowers. All the multiformed
hills between which the road wound
were planted with fruit trees, which stood in full
bloom. And when the travelers wearied of
looking at the white and red blossoms of the
apricots and persimmons, they could rest their
eyes by observing the young vine-leaves, which
pushed their way through the dark brown
branches, and their growth was so rapid that
one could almost follow it with the eye.</p>

<p>It was not only flowers and spring green that
made the journey pleasant, but the pleasure was
enhanced by watching the throngs of people
who were on their way to Jerusalem this morning.
From all the roads and by-paths, from
lonely heights, and from the most remote corners
of the plain came travelers. When they
had reached the road to Jerusalem, those who
traveled alone formed themselves into companies
and marched forward with glad shouts.
Round an elderly man, who rode on a jogging
camel, walked his sons and daughters, his sons-in-law
and daughters-in-law, and all his grandchildren.
It was such a large family that it
made up an entire little village. An old grandmother
who was too feeble to walk her sons
had taken in their arms, and with pride she
let herself be borne among the crowds, who
respectfully stepped aside.</p>

<p>In truth, it was a morning to inspire joy even
in the most disconsolate. To be sure the sky
was not clear, but was o’ercast with a thin
grayish-white mist, but none of the wayfarers
thought of grumbling because the sun’s piercing
brilliancy was dampened. Under this veiled sky
the perfume of the budding leaves and blossoms
did not penetrate the air as usual, but lingered
over roads and fields. And this beautiful day,
with its faint mist and hushed winds, which
reminded one of Night’s rest and calm, seemed
to communicate to the hastening crowds somewhat
of itself, so that they went forward happy—yet
with solemnity—singing in subdued voices
ancient hymns, or playing upon peculiar old-fashioned
instruments, from which came tones
like the buzzing of gnats, or grasshoppers’
piping.</p>

<p>When old Faustina rode forward among all
the people, she became infected with their joy
and excitement. She prodded her horse to
quicker speed, as she said to a young Roman
who rode beside her: “I dreamt last night that
I saw Tiberius, and he implored me not to
postpone the journey, but to ride to Jerusalem
to-day. It appears as if the gods had wished to
send me a warning not to neglect to go there
this beautiful morning.”</p>

<p>Just as she said this, she came to the top
of a long mountain ridge, and there she was
obliged to halt. Before her lay a large, deep
valley-basin, surrounded by pretty hills, and
from the dark, shadowy depths of the vale rose
the massive mountain which held on its head
the city of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But the narrow mountain city, with its walls
and towers, which lay like a jeweled coronet
upon the cliff’s smooth height, was this day magnified
a thousand-fold. All the hills which
encircled the valley were bedecked with gay
tents, and with a swarm of human beings.</p>

<p>It was evident to Faustina that all the inhabitants
were on their way to Jerusalem to
celebrate some great holiday. Those from a
distance had already come, and had managed
to put their tents in order. On the other hand,
those who lived near the city were still on
their way. Along all the shining rock-heights
one saw them come streaming in like an unbroken
sea of white robes, of songs, of holiday
cheer.</p>

<p>For some time the old woman surveyed these
seething throngs of people and the long rows
of tent-poles. Thereupon she said to the young
Roman who rode beside her:</p>

<p>“Verily, Sulpicius, the whole nation must
have come to Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“It really appears like it,” replied the
Roman, who had been chosen by Tiberius to
accompany Faustina because he had, during a
number of years, lived in Judea. “They celebrate
now the great Spring Festival, and at this
time all the people, both old and young, come
to Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>Faustina reflected a moment. “I am glad
that we came to this city on the day that the
people celebrate their festival,” said she. “It
can not signify anything else than that the gods
protect our journey. Do you think it likely
that he whom we seek, the Prophet of Nazareth,
has also come to Jerusalem to participate in the
festivities?”</p>

<p>“You are surely right, Faustina,” said the
Roman. “He must be here in Jerusalem. This
is indeed a decree of the gods. Strong and vigorous
though you be, you may consider yourself
fortunate if you escape making the long
and troublesome journey up to Galilee.”</p>

<p>At once he rode over to a couple of wayfarers
and asked them if they thought the
Prophet of Nazareth was in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“We have seen him here every day at this
season,” answered one. “Surely he must be
here even this year, for he is a holy and righteous
man.”</p>

<p>A woman stretched forth her hand and
pointed towards a hill, which lay east of the
city. “Do you see the foot of that mountain,
which is covered with olive trees?” she
said. “It is there that the Galileans usually
raise their tents, and there you will get the
most reliable information about him whom you
seek.”</p>

<p>They journeyed farther, and traveled on a
winding path all the way down to the bottom
of the valley, and then they began to ride
up toward Zion’s hill, to reach the city on
its heights. The woman who had spoken went
along the same way.</p>

<p>The steep ascending road was encompassed
here by low walls, and upon these countless
beggars and cripples sat or lolled. “Look,”
said the woman who had spoken, pointing to
one of the beggars who sat on the wall, “there
is a Galilean! I recollect that I have seen him
among the Prophet’s disciples. He can tell you
where you will find him you seek.”</p>

<p>Faustina and Sulpicius rode up to the man
who had been pointed out to her. He was a
poor old man with a heavy iron-gray beard.
His face was bronzed by heat and sunshine. He
asked no alms; on the contrary, he was so
engrossed in anxious thought that he did not
even glance at the passers-by.</p>

<p>Nor did he hear that Sulpicius addressed him,
and the latter had to repeat his question several
times.</p>

<p>“My friend, I’ve been told that you are a
Galilean. I beg you, therefore, to tell me where
I shall find the Prophet from Nazareth!”</p>

<p>The Galilean gave a sudden start and looked
around him, confused. But when he finally comprehended
what was wanted of him, he was
seized with rage mixed with terror. “What are
you talking about?” he burst out. “Why do
you ask me about that man? I know nothing
of him. I’m not a Galilean.”</p>

<p>The Hebrew woman now joined in the
conversation. “Still I have seen you in his company,”
she protested. “Do not fear, but tell
this noble Roman lady, who is the Emperor’s
friend, where she is most likely to find him.”</p>

<p>But the terrified disciple grew more and more
irascible. “Have all the people gone mad to-day?”
said he. “Are they possessed by an
evil spirit, since they come again and again
and ask me about that man? Why will no one
believe me when I say that I do not know the
Prophet? I do not come from his country. I
have never seen him.”</p>

<p>His irritability attracted attention, and a
couple of beggars who sat on the wall beside
him also began to dispute his word.</p>

<p>“Certainly you were among his disciples,”
said one. “We all know that you came with
him from Galilee.”</p>

<p>Then the man raised his arms toward heaven
and cried: “I could not endure it in Jerusalem
to-day on that man’s account, and now they will
not even leave me in peace out here among
the beggars! Why don’t you believe me when
I say to you that I have never seen him?”</p>

<p>Faustina turned away with a shrug. “Let
us go farther!” said she. “The man is mad.
From him we will learn nothing.”</p>

<p>They went farther up the mountain. Faustina
was not more than two steps from the
city gate, when the Hebrew woman who had
wished to help her find the Prophet called to
her to be careful. She pulled in her reins and
saw that a man lay in the road, just in front
of the horse’s feet, where the crush was
greatest. It was a miracle that he had not
already been trampled to death by animals or
people.</p>

<p>The man lay upon his back and stared upward
with lusterless eyes. He did not move,
although the camels placed their heavy feet
close beside him. He was poorly clad, and
besides he was covered with dust and dirt. In
fact, he had thrown so much gravel over himself
that it looked as if he tried to hide himself,
to be more easily over-ridden and trampled
down.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Why does this man
lie here on the road?” asked Faustina.</p>

<p>Instantly the man began shouting to the
passers-by:</p>

<p>“In mercy, brothers and sisters, drive your
horses and camels over me! Do not turn aside
for me! Trample me to dust! I have betrayed
innocent blood. Trample me to dust!”</p>

<p>Sulpicius caught Faustina’s horse by the
bridle and turned it to one side. “It is a sinner
who wants to do penance,” said he. “Do
not let this delay your journey. These people
are peculiar and one must let them follow their
own bent.”</p>

<p>The man in the road continued to shout: “Set
your heels on my heart! Let the camels crush
my breast and the asses dig their hoofs into
my eyes!”</p>

<p>But Faustina seemed loath to ride past the
miserable man without trying to make him rise.
She remained all the while beside him.</p>

<p>The Hebrew woman who had wished to serve
her once before, pushed her way forward again.
“This man also belonged to the Prophet’s disciples,”
said she. “Do you wish me to ask him
about his Master?”</p>

<p>Faustina nodded affirmatively, and the woman
bent down over the man.</p>

<p>“What have you Galileans done this day
with your Master?” she asked. “I meet you
scattered on highways and byways, but him I
see nowhere.”</p>

<p>But when she questioned in this manner, the
man who lay in the dust rose to his knees.
“What evil spirit hath possessed you to ask me
about him?” he said, in a voice that was filled
with despair. “You see, surely, that I have lain
down in the road to be trampled to death. Is
not that enough for you? Shall you come also
and ask me what I have done with him?”</p>

<p>When she repeated the question, the man
staggered to his feet and put both hands to
his ears.</p>

<p>“Woe unto you, that you can not let me die
in peace!” he cried. He forced his way
through the crowds that thronged in front of
the gate, and rushed away shrieking with terror,
while his torn robe fluttered around him like
dark wings.</p>

<p>“It appears to me as though we had come
to a nation of madmen,” said Faustina, when she
saw the man flee. She had become depressed by
seeing these disciples of the Prophet. Could
the man who numbered such fools among his
followers do anything for the Emperor?</p>

<p>Even the Hebrew woman looked distressed,
and she said very earnestly to Faustina: “Mistress,
delay not in your search for him whom
you would find! I fear some evil has befallen
him, since his disciples are beside themselves
and can not bear to hear him spoken of.”</p>

<p>Faustina and her retinue finally rode through
the gate archway and came in on the narrow
and dark streets, which were alive with people.
It seemed well-nigh impossible to get through
the city. The riders time and again had to stand
still. Slaves and soldiers tried in vain to clear
the way. The people continued to rush on in
a compact, irresistible stream.</p>

<p>“Verily,” said the old woman, “the streets
of Rome are peaceful pleasure gardens compared
with these!”</p>

<p>Sulpicius soon saw that almost insurmountable
difficulties awaited them.</p>

<p>“On these overcrowded streets it is easier to
walk than to ride,” said he. “If you are not
too fatigued, I should advise you to walk to
the Governor’s palace. It is a good distance
away, but if we ride we certainly will not get
there until after midnight.”</p>

<p>Faustina accepted the suggestion at once. She
dismounted, and left her horse with one of the
slaves. Thereupon the Roman travelers began
to walk through the city.</p>

<p>This was much better. They pushed their
way quickly toward the heart of the city, and
Sulpicius showed Faustina a rather wide street,
which they were nearing.</p>

<p>“Look, Faustina,” he said, “if we take this
street, we will soon be there. It leads directly
down to our quarters.”</p>

<p>But just as they were about to turn into
the street, the worst obstacle met them.</p>

<p>It happened that the very moment when
Faustina reached the street which extended from
the Governor’s palace to Righteousness’ Gate
and Golgotha, they brought through it a prisoner,
who was to be taken out and crucified.
Before him ran a crowd of wild youths who
wanted to witness the execution. They raced
up the street, waved their arms in rapture towards
the hill, and emitted unintelligible howls—in
their delight at being allowed to view something
which they did not see every day.</p>

<p>Behind them came companies of men in silken
robes, who appeared to belong to the city’s
élite and foremost. Then came women, many
of whom had tear-stained faces. A gathering
of poor and maimed staggered forward, uttering
shrieks that pierced the ears.</p>

<p>“O God!” they cried, “save him! Send
Thine angel and save him! Send a deliverer
in his direst need!”</p>

<p>Finally there came a few Roman soldiers on
great horses. They kept guard so that none
of the people could dash up to the prisoner
and try to rescue him.</p>

<p>Directly behind them followed the executioners,
whose task it was to lead forward the
man that was to be crucified. They had laid
a heavy wooden cross over his shoulder, but
he was too weak for this burden. It weighed
him down so that his body was almost bent
to the ground. He held his head down so far
that no one could see his face.</p>

<p>Faustina stood at the opening of the little bystreet
and saw the doomed man’s heavy tread.
She noticed, with surprise, that he wore a
purple mantle, and that a crown of thorns was
pressed down upon his head.</p>

<p>“Who is this man?” she asked.</p>

<p>One of the bystanders answered her: “It
is one who wished to make himself Emperor.”</p>

<p>“And must he suffer death for a thing which
is scarcely worth striving after?” said the old
woman sadly.</p>

<p>The doomed man staggered under the cross.
He dragged himself forward more and more
slowly. The executioners had tied a rope
around his waist, and they began to pull on
it to hasten the speed. But as they pulled the
rope the man fell, and lay there with the cross
over him.</p>

<p>There was a terrible uproar. The Roman
soldiers had all they could do to hold the crowds
back. They drew their swords on a couple of
women who tried to rush forward to help the
fallen man. The executioners attempted to
force him up with cuffs and lashes, but he could
not move because of the cross. Finally two of
them took hold of the cross to remove it.</p>

<p>Then he raised his head, and old Faustina
could see his face. The cheeks were streaked
by lashes from a whip, and from his brow, which
was wounded by the thorn-crown, trickled some
drops of blood. His hair hung in knotted
tangles, clotted with sweat and blood. His jaw
was firm set, but his lips trembled, as if they
struggled to suppress a cry. His eyes, tear-filled
and almost blinded from torture and
fatigue, stared straight ahead.</p>

<p>But back of this half-dead person’s face, the
old woman saw—as in a vision—a pale and beautiful
One with glorious, majestic eyes and gentle
features, and she was seized with sudden grief—touched
by the unknown man’s misfortune
and degradation.</p>

<p>“Oh, what have they done with you, you
poor soul!” she burst out, and moved a step
nearer him, while her eyes filled with tears.
She forgot her own sorrow and anxiety for this
tortured man’s distress. She thought her heart
would burst from pity. She, like the other
women, wanted to rush forward and tear him
away from the executioners!</p>

<p>The fallen man saw how she came toward
him, and he crept closer to her. It was as
though he had expected to find protection with
her against all those who persecuted and tortured
him. He embraced her knees. He
pressed himself against her, like a child who
clings close to his mother for safety.</p>

<p>The old woman bent over him, and as the
tears streamed down her cheeks, she felt the
most blissful joy because he had come and
sought protection with her. She placed one arm
around his neck, and as a mother first of all
wipes away the tears from her child’s eyes, she
laid her kerchief of sheer fine linen over his face,
to wipe away the tears and the blood.</p>

<p>But now the executioners were ready with the
cross. They came now and snatched away the
prisoner. Impatient over the delay, they
dragged him off in wild haste. The condemned
man uttered a groan when he was led away
from the refuge he had found, but he made no
resistance.</p>

<p>Faustina embraced him to hold him back,
and when her feeble old hands were powerless
and she saw him borne away, she felt as if
some one had torn from her her own child,
and she cried: “No, no! Do not take him
from me! He must not die! He shall not
die!”</p>

<p>She felt the most intense grief and indignation
because he was being led away. She wanted
to rush after him. She wanted to fight with
the executioners and tear him from them.</p>

<p>But with the first step she took, she was
seized with weakness and dizziness. Sulpicius
made haste to place his arm around her, to
prevent her from falling.</p>

<p>On one side of the street he saw a little shop,
and carried her in. There was neither bench
nor chair inside, but the shopkeeper was a
kindly man. He helped her over to a rug, and
arranged a bed for her on the stone floor.</p>

<p>She was not unconscious, but such a great
dizziness had seized her that she could not sit
up, but was forced to lie down.</p>

<p>“She has made a long journey to-day, and
the noise and crush in the city have been too
much for her,” said Sulpicius to the merchant.
“She is very old, and no one is so strong as
not to be conquered by age.”</p>

<p>“This is a trying day, even for one who is
not old,” said the merchant. “The air is almost
too heavy to breathe. It would not surprise me
if a severe storm were in store for us.”</p>

<p>Sulpicius bent over the old woman. She had
fallen asleep, and she slept with calm, regular
respirations after all the excitement and fatigue.</p>

<p>He walked over to the shop door, stood there,
and looked at the crowds while he awaited her
waking.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The Roman governor at Jerusalem had a
young wife, and she had had a dream during
the night preceding the day when Faustina entered
the city.</p>

<p>She dreamed that she stood on the roof of
her house and looked down upon the beautiful
court, which, according to the Oriental custom,
was paved with marble, and planted with rare
growths.</p>

<p>But in the court she saw assembled all the
sick and blind and halt there were in the world.
She saw before her the pest-ridden, with bodies
swollen with boils; lepers with disfigured faces;
the paralytics, who could not move, but lay
helpless upon the ground, and all the wretched
creatures who writhed in torment and pain.</p>

<p>They all crowded up towards the entrance,
to get into the house; and a number of those
who walked foremost pounded on the palace
door.</p>

<p>At last she saw that a slave opened the door
and came out on the threshold, and she heard
him ask what they wanted.</p>

<p>Then they answered him, saying: “We seek
the great Prophet whom God hath sent to the
world. Where is the Prophet of Nazareth,
he who is master of all suffering? Where is he
who can deliver us from all our torment?”</p>

<p>Then the slave answered them in an arrogant
and indifferent tone—as palace servants do when
they turn away the poor stranger:</p>

<p>“It will profit you nothing to seek the great
Prophet. Pilate has killed him.”</p>

<p>Then there arose among all the sick a grief
and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth which
she could not bear to hear. Her heart was
wrung with compassion, and tears streamed
from her eyes. But when she had begun to
weep, she awakened.</p>

<p>Again she fell asleep; and again she dreamed
that she stood on the roof of her house and
looked down upon the big court, which was as
broad as a square.</p>

<p>And behold! the court was filled with all the
insane and soul-sick and those possessed of evil
spirits. And she saw those who were naked
and those who were covered with their long
hair, and those who had braided themselves
crowns of straw and mantles of grass and believed
they were kings, and those who crawled
on the ground and thought themselves beasts,
and those who came dragging heavy stones,
which they believed to be gold, and those who
thought that the evil spirits spoke through their
mouths.</p>

<p>She saw all these crowd up toward the palace
gate. And the ones who stood nearest to it
knocked and pounded to get in.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and a slave stepped
out on the threshold and asked: “What do
you want?”</p>

<p>Then all began to cry aloud, saying: “Where
is the great Prophet of Nazareth, he who was
sent of God, and who shall restore to us our
souls and our wits?”</p>

<p>She heard the slave answer them in the most
indifferent tone: “It is useless for you to seek
the great Prophet, Pilate has killed him.”</p>

<p>When this was said, they uttered a shriek as
wild as a beast’s howl, and in their despair they
began to lacerate themselves until the blood ran
down on the stones. And when she that dreamed
saw their distress, she wrung her hands and
moaned. And her own moans awakened
her.</p>

<p>But again she fell asleep, and again, in her
dream, she was on the roof of her house.
Round about her sat her slaves, who played
for her upon cymbals and zithers, and the almond
trees shook their white blossoms over
her, and clambering rose-vines exhaled their
perfume.</p>

<p>As she sat there, a voice spoke to her: “Go
over to the balustrade which incloses the roof,
and see who they are that stand and wait in
your court!”</p>

<p>But in the dream she declined, and said: “I
do not care to see any more of those who throng
my court to-night.”</p>

<p>Just then she heard a clanking of chains and
a pounding of heavy hammers, and the pounding
of wood against wood. Her slaves ceased
their singing and playing and hurried over to
the railing and looked down. Nor could she
herself remain seated, but walked thither and
looked down on the court.</p>

<p>Then she saw that the court was filled with
all the poor prisoners in the world. She saw
those who must lie in dark prison dungeons,
fettered with heavy chains; she saw those who
labored in the dark mines come dragging their
heavy planks, and those who were rowers on
war galleys come with their heavy iron-bound
oars. And those who were condemned to be
crucified came dragging their crosses, and those
who were to be beheaded came with their broadaxes.
She saw those who were sent into slavery
to foreign lands and whose eyes burned with
homesickness. She saw those who must serve
as beasts of burden, and whose backs were bleeding
from lashes.</p>

<p>All these unfortunates cried as with one voice:
“Open, open!”</p>

<p>Then the slave who guarded the entrance
stepped to the door and asked: “What is it
that you wish?”</p>

<p>And these answered like the others: “We
seek the great Prophet of Nazareth, who has
come to the world to give the prisoners their
freedom and the slaves their lost happiness.”</p>

<p>The slave answered them in a tired and indifferent
tone: “You can not find him here.
Pilate has killed him.”</p>

<p>When this was said, she who dreamed
thought that among all the unhappy there arose
such an outburst of scorn and blasphemy that
heaven and earth trembled. She was ice-cold
with fright, and her body shook so that she
awaked.</p>

<p>When she was thoroughly awake, she sat
up in bed and thought to herself: “I would not
dream more. Now I want to remain awake
all night, that I may escape seeing more of this
horror.”</p>

<p>And even whilst she was thinking thus, drowsiness
crept in upon her anew, and she laid her
head on the pillow and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Again she dreamed that she sat on the roof
of her house, and now her little son ran back and
forth up there, and played with a ball.</p>

<p>Then she heard a voice that said to her:
“Go over to the balustrade, which incloses
the roof, and see who they are that stand and
wait in your court!” But she who dreamed
said to herself: “I have seen enough misery this
night. I can not endure any more. I would
remain where I am.”</p>

<p>At that moment her son threw his ball so
that it dropped outside the balustrade, and the
child ran forward and clambered up on the railing.
Then she was frightened. She rushed
over and seized hold of the child.</p>

<p>But with that she happened to cast her eyes
downward, and once more she saw that the
court was full of people.</p>

<p>In the court were all the peoples of earth who
had been wounded in battle. They came with
severed bodies, with cut-off limbs, and with big
open wounds from which the blood oozed, so
that the whole court was drenched with it.</p>

<p>And beside these, came all the people in the
world who had lost their loved ones on the
battlefield. They were the fatherless who
mourned their protectors, and the young maidens
who cried for their lovers, and the aged who
sighed for their sons.</p>

<p>The foremost among them pushed against
the door, and the watchman came out as before,
and opened it.</p>

<p>He asked all these, who had been wounded in
battles and skirmishes: “What seek ye in this
house?”</p>

<p>And they answered: “We seek the great
Prophet of Nazareth, who shall prohibit wars
and rumors of wars and bring peace to the
earth. We seek him who shall convert spears
into scythes and swords into pruning hooks.”</p>

<p>Then answered the slave somewhat impatiently:
“Let no more come to pester me! I
have already said it often enough. The great
Prophet is not here. Pilate has killed him.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he closed the gate. But she who
dreamed thought of all the lamentation which
would come now. “I do not wish to hear it,”
said she, and rushed away from the balustrade.
That instant she awoke. Then she discovered
that in her terror she had jumped out of her
bed and down on the cold stone floor.</p>

<p>Again she thought she did not want to sleep
more that night, and again sleep overpowered
her, and she closed her eyes and began to dream.</p>

<p>She sat once more on the roof of her house,
and beside her stood her husband. She told
him of her dreams, and he ridiculed her.</p>

<p>Again she heard a voice, which said to her:
“Go see the people who wait in your court!”</p>

<p>But she thought: “I would not see them. I
have seen enough misery to-night.”</p>

<p>Just then she heard three loud raps on the
gate, and her husband walked over to the balustrade
to see who it was that asked admittance
to his house.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he leaned over the railing,
than he beckoned to his wife to come over to
him.</p>

<p>“Know you not this man?” said he, and
pointed down.</p>

<p>When she looked down on the court, she
found that it was filled with horses and riders,
slaves were busy unloading asses and camels.
It looked as though a distinguished traveler
might have landed.</p>

<p>At the entrance gate stood the traveler. He
was a large elderly man with broad shoulders
and a heavy and gloomy appearance.</p>

<p>The dreamer recognized the stranger instantly,
and whispered to her husband: “It is
Cæsar Tiberius, who is here in Jerusalem. It
can not be any one else.”</p>

<p>“I also seem to recognize him,” said her husband;
at the same time he placed his finger on
his mouth, as a signal that they should be quiet
and listen to what was said down in the court.</p>

<p>They saw that the doorkeeper came out and
asked the stranger: “Whom seek you?”</p>

<p>And the traveler answered: “I seek the great
Prophet of Nazareth, who is endowed with
God’s power to perform miracles. It is Emperor
Tiberius who calls him, that he may liberate
him from a terrible disease, which no
other physician can cure.”</p>

<p>When he had spoken, the slave bowed very
humbly and said: “My lord, be not wroth! but
your wish can not be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>Then the Emperor turned toward his slaves,
who waited below in the court, and gave them
a command.</p>

<p>Then the slaves hastened forward—some
with handfuls of ornaments, others carried goblets
studded with pearls, other again dragged
sacks filled with gold coin.</p>

<p>The Emperor turned to the slave who
guarded the gate, and said: “All this shall
be his, if he helps Tiberius. With this he can
give riches to all the world’s poor.”</p>

<p>But the doorkeeper bowed still lower and
said: “Master, be not wroth with thy servant,
but thy request can not be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>Then the Emperor beckoned again to his
slaves, and a pair of them hurried forward with
a richly embroidered robe, upon which glittered
a breastpiece of jewels.</p>

<p>And the Emperor said to the slave: “See!
This which I offer him is the power over Judea.
He shall rule his people like the highest judge,
if he will only come and heal Tiberius!”</p>

<p>The slave bowed still nearer the earth, and
said: “Master, it is not within my power to
help you.”</p>

<p>Then the Emperor beckoned once again, and
his slaves rushed up with a golden coronet and
a purple mantle.</p>

<p>“See,” he said, “this is the Emperor’s will:
He promises to appoint the Prophet his successor,
and give him dominion over the world.
He shall have power to rule the world according
to his God’s will, if he will only stretch forth
his hand and heal Tiberius!”</p>

<p>Then the slave fell at the Emperor’s feet and
said in an imploring tone: “Master, it does
not lie in my power to attend to thy command.
He whom thou seekest is no longer here. Pilate
hath killed him.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>When the young woman awoke, it was already
full, clear day, and her female slaves stood
and waited that they might help her dress.</p>

<p>She was very silent while she dressed, but
finally she asked the slave who arranged her
hair, if her husband was up. She learned that
he had been called out to pass judgment on a
criminal. “I should have liked to talk with
him,” said the young woman.</p>

<p>“Mistress,” said the slave, “it will be difficult
to do so during the trial. We will let you
know as soon as it is over.”</p>

<p>She sat silent now until her toilet was completed.
Then she asked: “Has any among you
heard of the Prophet of Nazareth?”</p>

<p>“The Prophet of Nazareth is a Jewish miracle
performer,” answered one of the slaves
instantly.</p>

<p>“It is strange, Mistress, that you should ask
after him to-day,” said another slave. “It is
just he whom the Jews have brought here
to the palace, to let him be tried by the
Governor.”</p>

<p>She bade them go at once and ascertain for
what cause he was arraigned, and one of the
slaves withdrew. When she returned she said:
“They accuse him of wanting to make himself
King over this land, and they entreat the Governor
to let him be crucified.”</p>

<p>When the Governor’s wife heard this, she
grew terrified and said: “I must speak with my
husband, otherwise a terrible calamity will happen
here this day.”</p>

<p>When the slaves said once again that this
was impossible, she began to weep and shudder.
And one among them was touched, so she said:
“If you will send a written message to the
Governor, I will try and take it to him.”</p>

<p>Immediately she took a stylus and wrote a
few words on a wax tablet, and this was given to
Pilate.</p>

<p>But him she did not meet alone the whole
day; for when he had dismissed the Jews, and
the condemned man was taken to the place of
execution, the hour for repast was come, and to
this Pilate had invited a few of the Romans
who visited Jerusalem at this season. They
were the commander of the troops and a
young instructor in oratory, and several others
besides.</p>

<p>This repast was not very gay, for the Governor’s
wife sat all the while silent and dejected,
and took no part in the conversation.</p>

<p>When the guests asked if she was ill or distraught,
the Governor laughingly related about
the message she had sent him in the morning.
He chaffed her because she had believed that
a Roman governor would let himself be guided
in his judgments by a woman’s dreams.</p>

<p>She answered gently and sadly: “In truth,
it was no dream, but a warning sent by the
gods. You should at least have let the man
live through this one day.”</p>

<p>They saw that she was seriously distressed.
She would not be comforted, no matter how
much the guests exerted themselves, by keeping
up the conversation to make her forget these
empty fancies.</p>

<p>But after a while one of them raised his head
and exclaimed: “What is this? Have we sat so
long at table that the day is already gone?”</p>

<p>All looked up now, and they observed that
a dim twilight settled down over nature. Above
all, it was remarkable to see how the whole
variegated play of color which it spread over
all creatures and objects, faded away slowly,
so that all looked a uniform gray.</p>

<p>Like everything else, even their own faces
lost their color. “We actually look like the
dead,” said the young orator with a shudder.
“Our cheeks are gray and our lips black.”</p>

<p>As this darkness grew more intense, the
woman’s fear increased. “Oh, my friend!” she
burst out at last. “Can’t you perceive even
now that the Immortals would warn you? They
are incensed because you condemned a holy and
innocent man. I am thinking that although he
may already be on the cross, he is surely not
dead yet. Let him be taken down from the
cross! I would with mine own hands nurse his
wounds. Only grant that he be called back
to life!”</p>

<p>But Pilate answered laughingly: “You are
surely right in that this is a sign from the gods.
But they do not let the sun lose its luster because
a Jewish heretic has been condemned to the
cross. On the contrary, we may expect that
important matters shall appear, which concern
the whole kingdom. Who can tell how long
old Tiberius——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for the darkness
had become so profound he could not see
even the wine goblet standing in front of him.
He broke off, therefore, to order the slaves to
fetch some lamps instantly.</p>

<p>When it had become so light that he could
see the faces of his guests, it was impossible for
him not to notice the depression which had
come over them. “Mark you!” he said half-angrily
to his wife. “Now it is apparent to me
that you have succeeded with your dreams in
driving away the joys of the table. But if it
must needs be that you can not think of anything
else to-day, then let us hear what you have
dreamed. Tell it us and we will try to interpret
its meaning!”</p>

<p>For this the young wife was ready at once.
And while she related vision after vision, the
guests grew more and more serious. They
ceased emptying their goblets, and they sat with
brows knit. The only one who continued to
laugh and to call the whole thing madness, was
the Governor himself.</p>

<p>When the narrative was ended, the young
rhetorician said: “Truly, this is something more
than a dream, for I have seen this day not
the Emperor, but his old friend Faustina,
march into the city. Only it surprises me that
she has not already appeared in the Governor’s
palace.”</p>

<p>“There is actually a rumor abroad to the
effect that the Emperor has been stricken with
a terrible illness,” observed the leader of the
troops. “It also seems very possible to me that
your wife’s dream may be a god-sent warning.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing incredible in this, that
Tiberius has sent messengers after the Prophet
to summon him to his sick-bed,” agreed the
young rhetorician.</p>

<p>The Commander turned with profound seriousness
toward Pilate. “If the Emperor has
actually taken it into his head to let this miracle-worker
be summoned, it were better for you
and for all of us that he found him alive.”</p>

<p>Pilate answered irritably: “Is it the darkness
that has turned you into children? One would
think that you had all been transformed into
dream-interpreters and prophets.”</p>

<p>But the courtier continued his argument: “It
may not be impossible, perhaps, to save the
man’s life, if you sent a swift messenger.”</p>

<p>“You want to make a laughing-stock of me,”
answered the Governor. “Tell me, what would
become of law and order in this land, if they
learned that the Governor pardoned a criminal
because his wife has dreamed a bad dream?”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, however, and not a dream,
that I have seen Faustina in Jerusalem,” said
the young orator.</p>

<p>“I shall take the responsibility of defending
my actions before the Emperor,” said Pilate.
“He will understand that this visionary, who
let himself be misused by my soldiers without
resistance, would not have had the power to
help him.”</p>

<p>As he was speaking, the house was shaken
by a noise like a powerful rolling thunder, and
an earthquake shook the ground. The Governor’s
palace stood intact, but during some
minutes just after the earthquake, a terrific crash
of crumbling houses and falling pillars was
heard.</p>

<p>As soon as a human voice could make itself
heard, the Governor called a slave.</p>

<p>“Run out to the place of execution and command
in my name that the Prophet of Nazareth
shall be taken down from the cross!”</p>

<p>The slave hurried away. The guests filed
from the dining-hall out on the peristyle, to be
under the open sky in case the earthquake should
be repeated. No one dared to utter a word,
while they awaited the slave’s return.</p>

<p>He came back very shortly. He stopped before
the Governor.</p>

<p>“You found him alive?” said he.</p>

<p>“Master, he was dead, and on the very second
that he gave up the ghost, the earthquake
occurred.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken when two loud
knocks sounded against the outer gate. When
these knocks were heard, they all staggered back
and leaped up, as though it had been a new
earthquake.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards a slave came up.</p>

<p>“It is the noble Faustina and the Emperor’s
kinsman Sulpicius. They are come to beg you
help them find the Prophet from Nazareth.”</p>

<p>A low murmur passed through the peristyle,
and soft footfalls were heard. When the Governor
looked around, he noticed that his friends
had withdrawn from him, as from one upon
whom misfortune has fallen.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Old Faustina had returned to Capri and had
sought out the Emperor. She told him her
story, and while she spoke she hardly dared look
at him. During her absence the illness had
made frightful ravages, and she thought to
herself: “If there had been any pity among
the Celestials, they would have let me die before
being forced to tell this poor, tortured man
that all hope is gone.”</p>

<p>To her astonishment, Tiberius listened to her
with the utmost indifference. When she related
how the great miracle performer had been crucified
the same day that she had arrived in Jerusalem,
and how near she had been to saving
him, she began to weep under the weight of
her failure. But Tiberius only remarked: “You
actually grieve over this? Ah, Faustina! A
whole lifetime in Rome has not weaned you
then of faith in sorcerers and miracle workers,
which you imbibed during your childhood in
the Sabine mountains!”</p>

<p>Then the old woman perceived that Tiberius
had never expected any help from the Prophet
of Nazareth.</p>

<p>“Why did you let me make the journey to
that distant land, if you believed all the while
that it was useless?”</p>

<p>“You are the only friend I have,” said the
Emperor. “Why should I deny your prayer,
so long as I still have the power to grant it.”</p>

<p>But the old woman did not like it that the
Emperor had taken her for a fool.</p>

<p>“Ah! this is your usual cunning,” she burst
out. “This is just what I can tolerate least
in you.”</p>

<p>“You should not have come back to me,” said
Tiberius. “You should have remained in the
mountains.”</p>

<p>It looked for a moment as if these two, who
had clashed so often, would again fall into a
war of words, but the old woman’s anger subsided
immediately. The times were past when
she could quarrel in earnest with the Emperor.
She lowered her voice again; but she could not
altogether relinquish every effort to obtain
justice.</p>

<p>“But this man was really a prophet,” she
said. “I have seen him. When his eyes met
mine, I thought he was a god. I was mad to
allow him to go to his death.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you let him die,” said Tiberius.
“He was a traitor and a dangerous agitator.”</p>

<p>Faustina was about to burst into another
passion—then checked herself.</p>

<p>“I have spoken with many of his friends in
Jerusalem about him,” said she. “He had
not committed the crimes for which he was
arraigned.”</p>

<p>“Even if he had not committed just these
crimes, he was surely no better than any one
else,” said the Emperor wearily. “Where will
you find the person who during his lifetime has
not a thousand times deserved death?”</p>

<p>But these remarks of the Emperor decided
Faustina to undertake something which she had
until now hesitated about. “I will show you
a proof of his power,” said she. “I said to
you just now that I laid my kerchief over
his face. It is the same kerchief which I
hold in my hand. Will you look at it a
moment?”</p>

<p>She spread the kerchief out before the Emperor,
and he saw delineated thereon the shadowy
likeness of a human face.</p>

<p>The old woman’s voice shook with emotion
as she continued: “This man saw that I loved
him. I know not by what power he was
enabled to leave me his portrait. But mine eyes
fill up with tears when I see it.”</p>

<p>The Emperor leaned forward and regarded
the picture, which appeared to be made up of
blood and tears and the dark shadows of grief.
Gradually the whole face stood out before him,
exactly as it had been imprinted upon the kerchief.
He saw the blood-drops on the forehead,
the piercing thorn-crown, the hair, which was
matted with blood, and the mouth whose lips
seemed to quiver with agony.</p>

<p>He bent down closer and closer to the picture.
The face stood out clearer and clearer.
From out the shadow-like outlines, all at once,
he saw the eyes sparkle as with hidden life.
And while they spoke to him of the most terrible
suffering, they also revealed a purity and
sublimity which he had never seen before.</p>

<p>He lay upon his couch and drank in the picture
with his eyes. “Is this a mortal?” he said
softly and slowly. “Is this a mortal?”</p>

<p>Again he lay still and regarded the picture.
The tears began to stream down his cheeks. “I
mourn over thy death, thou Unknown!” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“Faustina!” he cried out at last. “Why
did you let this man die? He would have healed
me.”</p>

<p>And again he was lost in the picture.</p>

<p>“O Man!” he said, after a moment, “if I
can not gain my health from thee, I can still
avenge thy murder. My hand shall rest heavily
upon those who have robbed me of thee!”</p>

<p>Again he lay still a long time; then he let
himself glide down to the floor—and he knelt
before the picture:</p>

<p>“Thou art Man!” said he. “Thou art that
which I never dreamed I should see.” And he
pointed to his disfigured face and destroyed
hands. “I and all others are wild beasts and
monsters, but thou art Man.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head so low before the picture
that it touched the floor. “Have pity on me,
thou Unknown!” he sobbed, and his tears
watered the stones.</p>

<p>“If thou hadst lived, thy glance alone would
have healed me,” he said.</p>

<p>The poor old woman was terror-stricken over
what she had done. It would have been wiser
not to show the Emperor the picture, thought
she. From the start she had been afraid that
if he should see it his grief would be too overwhelming.</p>

<p>And in her despair over the Emperor’s grief,
she snatched the picture away, as if to remove
it from his sight.</p>

<p>Then the Emperor looked up. And, lo! his
features were transformed, and he was as he
had been before the illness. It was as if the
illness had had its root and sustenance in the
contempt and hatred of mankind which had
lived in his heart; and it had been forced to
flee the very moment he had felt love and
compassion.</p>

<p>The following day Tiberius despatched three
messengers.</p>

<p>The first messenger traveled to Rome with
the command that the Senate should institute
investigations as to how the governor of Palestine
administered his official duties and punish
him, should it appear that he oppressed the
people and condemned the innocent to death.</p>

<p>The second messenger went to the vineyard-laborer
and his wife, to thank them and reward
them for the counsel they had given the Emperor,
and also to tell them how everything
had turned out. When they had heard all, they
wept silently, and the man said: “I know that
all my life I shall ponder what would have happened
if these two had met.” But the woman
answered: “It could not happen in any other
way. It was too great a thought that these
two should meet. God knew that the world
could not support it.”</p>

<p>The third messenger traveled to Palestine and
brought back with him to Capri some of Jesus’
disciples, and these began to teach there the
doctrine that had been preached by the Crucified
One.</p>

<p>When the disciples landed at Capri, old Faustina
lay upon her death-bed. Still they had time
before her death to make of her a follower
of the great Prophet, and to baptize her. And
in the baptism she was called Veronica, because
to her it had been granted to give to mankind
the true likeness of their Saviour.</p>

<h2 id='story9' class='c003'>ROBIN REDBREAST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It happened at the time when our Lord
created the world, when He not only made
heaven and earth, but all the animals and the
plants as well, at the same time giving them
their names.</p>

<p>There have been many histories concerning
that time, and if we knew them all, we should
have light upon everything in this world which
we can not now comprehend.</p>

<p>At that time it happened one day when our
Lord sat in His Paradise and painted the little
birds, that the colors in our Lord’s paint pot
gave out, and the goldfinch would have been
without color if our Lord had not wiped all
His paint brushes on its feathers.</p>

<p>It was then that the donkey got his long
ears, because he could not remember the name
that had been given him.</p>

<p>No sooner had he taken a few steps over
the meadows of Paradise than he forgot, and
three times he came back to ask his name. At
last our Lord grew somewhat impatient, took
him by his two ears, and said:</p>

<p>“Thy name is ass, ass, ass!” And while
He thus spake our Lord pulled both of his
ears that the ass might hear better, and remember
what was said to him. It was on the same
day, also, that the bee was punished.</p>

<p>Now, when the bee was created, she began
immediately to gather honey, and the animals
and human beings who caught the delicious odor
of the honey came and wanted to taste of it.
But the bee wanted to keep it all for herself and
with her poisonous sting pursued every living
creature that approached her hive. Our Lord
saw this and at once called the bee to Him and
punished her.</p>

<p>“I gave thee the gift of gathering honey,
which is the sweetest thing in all creation,” said
our Lord, “but I did not give thee the right
to be cruel to thy neighbor. Remember well
that every time thou stingest any creature who
desires to taste of thy honey, thou shalt surely
die!”</p>

<p>Ah, yes! It was at that time, too, that the
cricket became blind and the ant missed her
wings, so many strange things happened on that
day!</p>

<p>Our Lord sat there, big and gentle, and
planned and created all day long, and towards
evening He conceived the idea of making a
little gray bird. “Remember your name is
Robin Redbreast,” said our Lord to the bird,
as soon as it was finished. Then He held it
in the palm of His open hand and let it fly.</p>

<p>After the bird had been testing his wings
a while, and had seen something of the beautiful
world in which he was destined to live,
he became curious to see what he himself was
like. He noticed that he was entirely gray,
and that his breast was just as gray as all the
rest of him. Robin Redbreast twisted and
turned in all directions as he viewed himself
in the mirror of a clear lake, but he couldn’t
find a single red feather. Then he flew back
to our Lord.</p>

<p>Our Lord sat there on His throne, big and
gentle. Out of His hands came butterflies that
fluttered about His head; doves cooed on His
shoulders; and out of the earth beneath Him
grew the rose, the lily, and the daisy.</p>

<p>The little bird’s heart beat heavily with
fright, but with easy curves he flew nearer and
nearer our Lord, till at last he rested on our
Lord’s hand. Then our Lord asked what the
little bird wanted. “I only wish to ask you
about one thing,” said the little bird. “What is
it you wish to know?” said our Lord. “Why
should I be called Red Breast, when I am all
gray, from the bill to the very end of my
tail? Why am I called Red Breast when I do
not possess one single red feather?” The bird
looked beseechingly on our Lord with his tiny
black eyes—then turned his head. About him
he saw pheasants all red under a sprinkle of
gold dust, parrots with marvelous red neck-bands,
cocks with red combs, to say nothing
about the butterflies, the goldfinches, and the
roses! And naturally he thought how little
he needed—just one tiny drop of color on his
breast and he, too, would be a beautiful bird,
and his name would fit him. “Why should I
be called Red Breast when I am so entirely
gray?” asked the bird once again, and waited
for our Lord to say: “Ah, my friend, I see that
I have forgotten to paint your breast feathers
red, but wait a moment and it shall be done.”</p>

<p>But our Lord only smiled a little and said:
“I have called you Robin Redbreast, and Robin
Redbreast shall your name be, but you must
look to it that you yourself earn your red breast
feathers.” Then our Lord lifted His hand
and let the bird fly once more—out into the
world.</p>

<p>The bird flew down into Paradise, meditating
deeply.</p>

<p>What could a little bird like him do to earn
for himself red feathers? The only thing he
could think of was to make his nest in a brier
bush. He built it in among the thorns in the
close thicket. It looked as if he waited for
a rose leaf to cling to his throat and give him
color.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Countless years had come and gone since that
day, which was the happiest in all the world!
Human beings had already advanced so far
that they had learned to cultivate the earth
and sail the seas. They had procured clothes
and ornaments for themselves, and had long
since learned to build big temples and great
cities—such as Thebes, Rome, and Jerusalem.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Then there dawned a <em>new</em> day, one that will
long be remembered in the world’s history. On
the morning of this day Robin Redbreast sat
upon a little naked hillock outside of Jerusalem’s
walls, and sang to his young ones, who rested
in a tiny nest in a brier bush.</p>

<p>Robin Redbreast told the little ones all about
that wonderful day of creation, and how the
Lord had given names to everything, just as
each Redbreast had told it ever since the first
Redbreast had heard God’s word, and gone out
of God’s hand. “And mark you,” he ended
sorrowfully, “so many years have gone, so
many roses have bloomed, so many little birds
have come out of their eggs since Creation Day,
but Robin Redbreast is still a little gray bird.
He has not yet succeeded in gaining his red
feathers.”</p>

<p>The little young ones opened wide their tiny
bills, and asked if their forbears had never
tried to do any great thing to earn the priceless
red color.</p>

<p>“We have all done what we could,” said
the little bird, “but we have all gone amiss.
Even the first Robin Redbreast met one day
another bird exactly like himself, and he began
immediately to love it with such a mighty love
that he could feel his breast burn. ‘Ah!’ he
thought then, ‘now I understand! It was our
Lord’s meaning that I should love with so
much ardor that my breast should grow red in
color from the very warmth of the love that
lives in my heart.’ But he missed it, as all those
who came after him have missed it, and as
even you shall miss it.”</p>

<p>The little young ones twittered, utterly bewildered,
and already began to mourn because the
red color would not come to beautify their little,
downy gray breasts.</p>

<p>“We had also hoped that song would help
us,” said the grown-up bird, speaking in long-drawn-out
tones—“the first Robin Redbreast
sang until his heart swelled within him, he was
so carried away, and he dared to hope anew.
‘Ah!’ he thought, ‘it is the glow of the song
which lives in my soul that will color my breast
feathers red.’ But he missed it, as all the others
have missed it and as even you shall miss it.”
Again was heard a sad “peep” from the young
ones’ half-naked throats.</p>

<p>“We had also counted on our courage and
our valor,” said the bird. “The first Robin
Redbreast fought bravely with other birds, until
his breast flamed with the pride of conquest.
‘Ah!’ he thought, ‘my breast feathers shall
become red from the love of battle which burns
in my heart.’ He, too, missed it, as all those
who came after him have missed it, and as even
you shall miss it.” The little young ones peeped
courageously that they still wished to try and
win the much-sought-for prize, but the bird
answered them sorrowfully that it would be impossible.
What could they do when so many
splendid ancestors had missed the mark? What
could they do more than love, sing, and fight?
What could—the little bird stopped short, for
out of one of the gates of Jerusalem came a
crowd of people marching, and the whole procession
rushed toward the hillock, where the
bird had its nest. There were riders on proud
horses, soldiers with long spears, executioners
with nails and hammers. There were judges
and priests in the procession, weeping women,
and above all a mob of mad, loose people
running about—a filthy, howling mob of
loiterers.</p>

<p>The little gray bird sat trembling on the
edge of his nest. He feared each instant that
the little brier bush would be trampled down
and his young ones killed!</p>

<p>“Be careful!” he cried to the little defenseless
young ones, “creep together and remain
quiet. Here comes a horse that will ride right
over us! Here comes a warrior with iron-shod
sandals! Here comes the whole wild, storming
mob!” Immediately the bird ceased his cry
of warning and grew calm and quiet. He almost
forgot the danger hovering over him.
Finally he hopped down into the nest and spread
his wings over the young ones.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is too terrible,” said he. “I don’t
wish you to witness this awful sight! There
are three miscreants who are going to be crucified!”
And he spread his wings so that the
little ones could see nothing.</p>

<p>They caught only the sound of hammers, the
cries of anguish, and the wild shrieks of the
mob.</p>

<p>Robin Redbreast followed the whole spectacle
with his eyes, which grew big with terror. He
could not take his glance from the three
unfortunates.</p>

<p>“How terrible human beings are!” said the
bird after a little while. “It isn’t enough that
they nail these poor creatures to a cross, but
they must needs place a crown of piercing thorns
upon the head of one of them. I see that the
thorns have wounded his brow so that the blood
flows,” he continued. “And this man is so
beautiful, and looks about him with such mild
glances that every one ought to love him. I
feel as if an arrow were shooting through my
heart, when I see him suffer!”</p>

<p>The little bird began to feel a stronger and
stronger pity for the thorn-crowned sufferer.
“Oh! if I were only my brother the eagle,”
thought he, “I would draw the nails from his
hands, and with my strong claws I would drive
away all those who torture him!” He saw
how the blood trickled down from the brow of
the Crucified One, and he could no longer remain
quiet in his nest. “Even if I am little
and weak, I can still do something for this
poor tortured one,” thought the bird. Then he
left his nest and flew out into the air, striking
wide circles around the Crucified One. He flew
around him several times without daring to
approach, for he was a shy little bird, who had
never dared to go near a human being. But
little by little he gained courage, flew close to
him, and drew with his little bill a thorn that
had become imbedded in the brow of the Crucified
One. And as he did this there fell on his
breast a drop of blood from the face of the
Crucified One;—it spread quickly and floated
out and colored all the little fine breast feathers.</p>

<p>Then the Crucified One opened his lips and
whispered to the bird: “Because of thy compassion,
thou hast won all that thy kind have
been striving after, ever since the world was
created.”</p>

<p>As soon as the bird had returned to his nest
his young ones cried to him: “Thy breast is
red! Thy breast feathers are redder than the
roses!”</p>

<p>“It is only a drop of blood from the poor
man’s forehead,” said the bird; “it will vanish
as soon as I bathe in a pool or a clear well.”</p>

<p>But no matter how much the little bird
bathed, the red color did not vanish—and when
his little young ones grew up, the blood-red
color shone also on their breast feathers, just
as it shines on every Robin Redbreast’s throat
and breast until this very day.</p>

<h2 id='story10' class='c003'>OUR LORD AND SAINT PETER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It happened at the time when our Lord and
Saint Peter were newly arrived in Paradise,
after having wandered on earth and suffered
hardships during many sorrowful years.</p>

<p>One can imagine that the change was a joy
to Saint Peter! One can picture to oneself that
it was quite another matter to sit upon Paradise
Mountain and look out over the world, instead
of wandering from door to door, like a
beggar. It was another matter to walk about
in the beautiful gardens of Paradise, instead of
roaming around on earth, not knowing if one
would be given house-room on a stormy night,
or if one would be forced to tramp the highway
in the chill and darkness.</p>

<p>One can imagine what a joy it must have
been to get to the right place at last after such
a journey. Saint Peter, to be sure, had not
always been certain that all would end well.
He couldn’t very well help feeling doubtful and
troubled at times, for it had been almost impossible
for poor Saint Peter to understand why
there was any earthly need for them to have
such a hard time of it, if our Lord was lord of
all the world.</p>

<p>Now, no yearning could come to torment
him any more. That he was glad of this one
can well believe.</p>

<p>Now, he could actually laugh at all the misery
which he and our Lord had been forced to
endure, and at the little that they had been
obliged to content themselves with.</p>

<p>Once, when things had turned out so badly
for them that Saint Peter thought he couldn’t
stand it any longer, our Lord had taken him
to a high mountain, and had begun the ascent
without telling him what they were there for.</p>

<p>They had wandered past the cities at the
foot of the mountain, and the castles higher
up. They had gone past the farms and cabins,
and had left behind them the last wood-chopper’s
cave.</p>

<p>They had come at last to the part where the
mountain stood naked, without verdure and
trees, and where a hermit had built him a hut,
wherein he might shelter needy travelers.</p>

<p>Afterward, they had walked over the snowfields,
where the mountain-rats sleep, and come
to the piled-up ice masses, which stood on edge
and a-tilt, and where scarcely a chamois could
pass.</p>

<p>Up there our Lord had found a little
red-breasted bird, that lay frozen to death on the
ice, and He had picked up the bullfinch and
tucked it in His bosom. And Saint Peter remembered
he had wondered if this was to be
their dinner.</p>

<p>They had wandered a long while on the slippery
ice-blocks, and it had seemed to Saint
Peter that he had never been so near perdition;
for a deadly cold wind and a deadly dark mist
enveloped them, and as far as he could discover,
there wasn’t a living thing to be found.
And, still, they were only half-way up the
mountain.</p>

<p>Then he begged our Lord to let him turn
back.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said our Lord, “for I want to
show you something which will give you courage
to meet all sorrows.”</p>

<p>For this they had gone on through mist and
cold until they had reached an interminably
high wall, which prevented them from going
farther.</p>

<p>“This wall extends all around the mountain,”
said our Lord, “and you can’t step over
it at any point. Nor can any living creature see
anything of that which lies behind it, for it is
here that Paradise begins; and all the way up
to the mountain’s summit live the blessed
dead.”</p>

<p>But Saint Peter couldn’t help looking doubtful.
“In there is neither darkness nor cold,”
said our Lord, “but there it is always summer,
with the bright light of suns and stars.”</p>

<p>But Saint Peter was not able to persuade himself
to believe this.</p>

<p>Then our Lord took the little bird which He
had just found on the ice, and, bending backwards,
threw it over the wall, so that it fell
down into Paradise.</p>

<p>And immediately thereafter Saint Peter
heard a loud, joyous trill, and recognized a bullfinch’s
song, and was greatly astonished.</p>

<p>He turned toward our Lord and said: “Let
us return to the earth and suffer all that must
be suffered, for now I see that you speak the
truth, and that there is a place where Life overcomes
death.”</p>

<p>And they descended from the mountain and
began their wanderings again.</p>

<p>And it was years before Saint Peter saw any
more than this one glimpse of Paradise; but
he had always longed for the land beyond the
wall. And now at last he was there, and did
not have to strive and yearn any more. Now
he could drink bliss in full measure all day long
from never-dying streams.</p>

<p>But Saint Peter had not been in Paradise a
fortnight before it happened that an angel
came to our Lord where He sat upon His
throne, bowed seven times before Him, and
told Him that a great sorrow must have come
upon Saint Peter. He would neither eat nor
drink, and his eyelids were red, as though he
had not slept for several nights.</p>

<p>As soon as our Lord heard this, He rose and
went to seek Saint Peter.</p>

<p>He found him far away, on one of the outskirts
of Paradise, where he lay upon the
ground, as if he were too exhausted to stand,
and he had rent his garments and strewn his
hair with ashes.</p>

<p>When our Lord saw him so distressed, He
sat down on the ground beside him, and talked
to him, just as He would have done had they
still been wandering around in this world of
trouble.</p>

<p>“What is it that makes you so sad, Saint
Peter?” said our Lord.</p>

<p>But grief had overpowered Saint Peter, so
that he could not answer.</p>

<p>“What is it that makes you so sad?” asked
our Lord once again.</p>

<p>When our Lord repeated the question, Saint
Peter took the gold crown from his head and
threw it at our Lord’s feet, as much as to say
he wanted no further share in His honor and
glory.</p>

<p>But our Lord understood, of course, that
Saint Peter was so disconsolate that he knew not
what he did. He showed no anger at him.</p>

<p>“You must tell me what troubles you,” said
He, just as gently as before, and with an even
greater love in His voice.</p>

<p>But now Saint Peter jumped up; and then
our Lord knew that he was not only disconsolate,
but downright angry. He came toward
our Lord with clenched fists and snapping eyes.</p>

<p>“Now I want a dismissal from your service!”
said Saint Peter. “I can not remain
another day in Paradise.”</p>

<p>Our Lord tried to calm him, just as He had
been obliged to do many times before, when
Saint Peter had flared up.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly you can go,” said He, “but
you must first tell me what it is that displeases
you.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you that I awaited a better reward
than this when we two endured all sorts
of misery down on earth,” said Saint Peter.</p>

<p>Our Lord saw that Saint Peter’s soul was
filled with bitterness, and He felt no anger at
him.</p>

<p>“I tell you that you are free to go whither
you will,” said He, “if you will only let me
know what is troubling you.”</p>

<p>Then, at last, Saint Peter told our Lord why
he was so unhappy. “I had an old mother,”
said he, “and she died a few days ago.”</p>

<p>“Now I know what distresses you,” said our
Lord. “You suffer because your mother has
not come into Paradise.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Saint Peter, and at the
same time his grief became so overwhelming
that he began to sob and moan.</p>

<p>“I think I deserved at least that she should
be permitted to come here,” said he.</p>

<p>But when our Lord learned what it was that
Saint Peter was grieving over, He, in turn, became
distressed. Saint Peter’s mother had not
been such that she could enter the Heavenly
Kingdom. She had never thought of anything
except to hoard money, and to the poor who
had knocked at her door she had never given
so much as a copper or a crust of bread. But
our Lord understood that it was impossible for
Saint Peter to grasp the fact that his mother
had been so greedy that she was not entitled
to bliss.</p>

<p>“Saint Peter,” said He, “how can you be
so sure that your mother would feel at home
here with us?”</p>

<p>“You say such things only that you may not
have to listen to my prayers,” said Saint Peter.
“Who wouldn’t be happy in Paradise?”</p>

<p>“One who does not feel joy over the happiness
of others can not rest content here,” said
our Lord.</p>

<p>“Then there are others than my mother who
do not belong here,” said Saint Peter, and our
Lord observed that he was thinking of Him.</p>

<p>And He felt deeply grieved because Saint
Peter had been stricken with such a heavy sorrow
that he no longer knew what he said. He
stood a moment and expected that Saint Peter
would repent, and understand that his mother
was not fit for Paradise. But the Saint would
not give in.</p>

<p>Then our Lord called an angel and commanded
that he should fly down into hell and
bring Saint Peter’s mother to Paradise.</p>

<p>“Let me see how he carries her,” said Saint
Peter.</p>

<p>Our Lord took Saint Peter by the hand and
led him out to a steep precipice which leaned
slantingly to one side. And He showed him
that he only had to lean over the precipice very,
very little to be able to look down into hell.</p>

<p>When Saint Peter glanced down, he could
not at first see anything more than if he had
looked into a deep well. It was as though an
endless chasm opened under him.</p>

<p>The first thing which he could faintly distinguish
was the angel, who had already started
on his way to the nether regions. Saint Peter
saw how the angel dived down into the great
darkness, without the least fear, and spread his
wings just a little, so as not to descend too
rapidly.</p>

<p>But when Saint Peter’s eyes had become a
little more used to the darkness he began to
see more and more. In the first place, he saw
that Paradise lay on a ring-mountain, which
encircled a wide chasm, and it was at the bottom
of this chasm that the souls of the sinful
had their abode. He saw how the angel sank
and sank a long while without reaching the
depths. He became absolutely terrified because
it was such a long distance down there.</p>

<p>“May he only come up again with my
mother!” said he.</p>

<p>Our Lord only looked at Saint Peter with
great sorrowful eyes. “There is no weight too
heavy for my angel to carry,” said He.</p>

<p>It was so far down to the nether regions that
no ray of sunlight could penetrate thither: there
darkness reigned. But it was as if the angel in
his flight must have brought with him a little
clearness and light, so that it was possible for
Saint Peter to see how it looked down there.</p>

<p>It was an endless, black rock-desert. Sharp,
pointed rocks covered the entire foundation.
There was not a green blade, not a tree, not a
sign of life.</p>

<p>But all over, on the sharp rocks, were condemned
souls. They hung over the edges,
whither they had clambered that they might
swing themselves up from the ravine; and when
they saw that they could get nowhere, they remained
up there, petrified with anguish.</p>

<p>Saint Peter saw some of them sit or lie with
arms extended in ceaseless longing, and with
eyes fixedly turned upwards. Others had covered
their faces with their hands, as if they
would shut out the hopeless horror around
them. They were all rigid; there was not one
among them who had the power to move.
Some lay in the water-pools, perfectly still,
without trying to rise from them.</p>

<p>But the most dreadful thing of all was—there
was such a great throng of the lost. It
was as though the bottom of the ravine were
made up of nothing but bodies and heads.</p>

<p>And Saint Peter was struck with a new fear.
“You shall see that he will not find her,” said
he to our Lord.</p>

<p>Once more our Lord looked at him with the
same grieved expression. He knew of course
that Saint Peter did not need to be uneasy about
the angel.</p>

<p>But to Saint Peter it looked all the while as
if the angel could not find his mother in that
great company of lost souls. He spread his
wings and flew back and forth over the nether
regions, while he sought her.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the poor lost creatures
caught a glimpse of the angel, and he sprang
up and stretched his arms towards him and
cried: “Take me with you! Take me with
you!”</p>

<p>Then, all at once, the whole throng was
alive. All the millions upon millions who languished
in hell, roused themselves that instant,
and raised their arms and cried to the angel
that he should take them with him to the
blessed Paradise.</p>

<p>Their shrieks were heard all the way up to
our Lord and Saint Peter, whose hearts
throbbed with anguish as they heard.</p>

<p>The angel swayed high above the condemned;
but as he traveled back and forth, to
find the one whom he sought, they all rushed
after him, so that it looked as though they had
been swept on by a whirlwind.</p>

<p>At last the angel caught sight of the one he
was to take with him. He folded his wings
over his back and shot down like a streak of
lightning, and the astonished Saint Peter gave
a cry of joy when he saw the angel place an
arm around his mother and lift her up.</p>

<p>“Blessed be thou that bringest my mother to
me!” said he.</p>

<p>Our Lord laid His hand gently on Saint
Peter’s shoulder, as if He would warn him not
to abandon himself to joy too soon.</p>

<p>But Saint Peter was ready to weep for joy,
because his mother was saved. He could not
understand that anything further would have
the power to part them. And his joy increased
when he saw that, quick as the angel had been
when he had lifted her up, still several of the
lost souls had succeeded in attaching themselves
to her who was to be saved, in order that they,
too, might be borne to Paradise with her.</p>

<p>There must have been a dozen who clung to
the old woman, and Saint Peter thought it was
a great honor for his mother to help so many
poor unfortunate beings out of perdition.</p>

<p>Nor did the angel do aught to hinder them.
He seemed not at all troubled with his burden,
but rose and rose, and moved his wings with no
more effort than if he were carrying a little
dead birdling to heaven.</p>

<p>But then Saint Peter saw that his mother began
to free herself from the lost souls that had
clung to her. She gripped their hands and
loosened their hold, so that one after another
tumbled down into hell.</p>

<p>Saint Peter could hear how they begged and
implored her; but the old woman did not desire
that any one but herself should be saved. She
freed herself from more and more of them, and
let them fall down into misery. And as they
fell, all space was filled with their lamentations
and curses.</p>

<p>Then Saint Peter begged and implored his
mother to show some compassion, but she
would not listen, and kept right on as before.</p>

<p>And Saint Peter saw how the angel flew
slower and slower, the lighter his burden became.
Such fear took hold of Saint Peter that
his legs shook, and he was forced to drop on his
knees.</p>

<p>Finally, there was only one condemned soul
who still clung to St. Peter’s mother. This was
a young woman who hung on her neck and
begged and cried in her ear that she would let
her go along with her to the blessed Paradise.</p>

<p>The angel with his burden had already come
so far that Saint Peter stretched out his arms to
receive his mother. He thought that the angel
had to make only two or three wing-strokes
more to reach the mountain.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, the angel held his
wings perfectly still, and his countenance became
dark as night.</p>

<p>For now the old woman had stretched her
hands back of her and gripped the arms of the
young woman who hung about her neck, and
she clutched and tore until she succeeded in
separating the clasped hands, so that she was free
from this last one also.</p>

<p>When the condemned one fell the angel sank
several fathoms lower, and it appeared as
though he had not the strength to lift his wings
again.</p>

<p>He looked down upon the old woman with
a deep, sorrowful glance; his hold around her
waist loosened, and he let her fall, as if she
were too heavy a burden for him, now that she
was alone.</p>

<p>Thereupon he swung himself with a single
stroke up into Paradise.</p>

<p>But Saint Peter lay for a long while in the
same place, and sobbed, and our Lord stood
silent beside him.</p>

<p>“Saint Peter,” said our Lord at last, “I
never thought that you would weep like this
after you had reached Paradise.”</p>

<p>Then God’s old servant raised his head and
answered: “What kind of a Paradise is this,
where I can hear the moans of my dearest
ones, and see the sufferings of my fellow
men!”</p>

<p>The face of our Lord became o’ercast by the
deepest sorrow. “What did I desire more than
to prepare a Paradise for all, of nothing but
light and happiness?” He said. “Do you not
understand that it was because of this I went
down among men and taught them to love their
neighbors as themselves? For as long as they
do this not, there will be no refuge in heaven
or on earth where pain and sorrow cannot reach
them.”</p>

<p>A great many years ago, when the city
of Florence had only just been made a
republic, a man lived there named Raniero di
Raniero. He was the son of an armorer, and
had learned his father’s trade, but he did not
care much to pursue it.</p>

<p>This Raniero was the strongest of men. It
was said of him that he bore a heavy iron
armor as lightly as others wear a silk shirt.
He was still a young man, but already he had
given many proofs of his strength. Once he
was in a house where grain was stored in the
loft. Too much grain had been heaped there;
and while Raniero was in the house one of the
loft beams broke down, and the whole roof was
about to fall in. He raised his arms and held
the roof up until the people managed to fetch
beams and poles to prop it.</p>

<p>It was also said of Raniero that he was the
bravest man that had ever lived in Florence,
and that he could never get enough of fighting.
As soon as he heard any noise in the street, he
rushed out from the workshop, in hopes that a
fight had arisen in which he might participate.
If he could only distinguish himself, he fought
just as readily with humble peasants as with
armored horsemen. He rushed into a fight
like a lunatic, without counting his opponents.</p>

<p>Florence was not very powerful in his time.
The people were mostly wool spinners and
cloth weavers, and these asked nothing better
than to be allowed to perform their tasks in
peace. Sturdy men were plentiful, but they
were not quarrelsome, and they were proud of
the fact that in their city better order prevailed
than elsewhere. Raniero often grumbled because
he was not born in a country where there
was a king who gathered around him valiant
men, and declared that in such an event he
would have attained great honor and renown.</p>

<p>Raniero was loud-mouthed and boastful;
cruel to animals, harsh toward his wife, and not
good for any one to live with. He would have
been handsome if he had not had several deep
scars across his face which disfigured him. He
was quick to jump at conclusions, and quick to
act, though his way was often violent.</p>

<p>Raniero was married to Francesca, who was
the daughter of Jacopo degli Uberti, a wise
and influential man. Jacopo had not been very
anxious to give his daughter to such a bully as
Raniero, but had opposed the marriage until
the very last. Francesca forced him to relent,
by declaring that she would never marry any
one else. When Jacopo finally gave his consent,
he said to Raniero: “I have observed
that men like you can more easily win a
woman’s love than keep it; therefore I shall
exact this promise from you: If my daughter
finds life with you so hard that she wishes to
come back to me, you will not prevent her.”
Francesca said it was needless to exact such a
promise, since she was so fond of Raniero that
nothing could separate her from him. But
Raniero gave his promise promptly. “Of one
thing you can be assured, Jacopo,” said he—“I
will not try to hold any woman who wishes to
flee from me.”</p>

<p>Then Francesca went to live with Raniero,
and all was well between them for a time.
When they had been married a few weeks,
Raniero took it into his head that he would
practice marksmanship. For several days he
aimed at a painting which hung upon a wall.
He soon became skilled, and hit the mark every
time. At last he thought he would like to try
and shoot at a more difficult mark. He looked
around for something suitable, but discovered
nothing except a quail that sat in a cage above
the courtyard gate. The bird belonged to
Francesca, and she was very fond of it; but,
despite this, Raniero sent a page to open the
cage, and shot the quail as it swung itself into
the air.</p>

<p>This seemed to him a very good shot, and he
boasted of it to any one who would listen to
him.</p>

<p>When Francesca learned that Raniero had
shot her bird, she grew pale and looked hard at
him. She marveled that he had wished to do a
thing which must bring grief to her; but she
forgave him promptly and loved him as
before.</p>

<p>Then all went well again for a time.</p>

<p>Raniero’s father-in-law, Jacopo, was a flax
weaver. He had a large establishment, where
much work was done. Raniero thought he had
discovered that hemp was mixed with the flax
in Jacopo’s workshop, and he did not keep
silent about it, but talked of it here and there in
the city. At last Jacopo also heard this chatter,
and tried at once to put a stop to it. He let
several other flax weavers examine his yarn and
cloth, and they found all of it to be of the very
finest flax. Only in one pack, which was designed
to be sold outside of Florence, was there
any mixture. Then Jacopo said that the deception
had been practised without his knowledge
or consent, by some one among his journeymen.
He apprehended at once that he would find it
difficult to convince people of this. He had
always been famed for honesty, and he felt very
keenly that his honor had been smirched.</p>

<p>Raniero, on the other hand, plumed himself
upon having succeeded in exposing a fraud,
and he bragged about it even in Francesca’s
hearing.</p>

<p>She felt deeply grieved; at the same time she
was as astonished as when he shot the bird. As
she thought of this, she seemed suddenly to see
her love before her; and it was like a great
piece of shimmery gold cloth. She could see
how big it was, and how it shimmered. But
from one corner a piece had been cut away, so
that it was not as big and as beautiful as it had
been in the beginning.</p>

<p>Still, it was as yet damaged so very little that
she thought: “It will probably last as long as
I live. It is so great that it can never come to
an end.”</p>

<p>Again, there was a period during which she
and Raniero were just as happy as they had
been at first.</p>

<p>Francesca had a brother named Taddeo. He
had been in Venice on a business trip, and,
while there, had purchased garments of silk and
velvet. When he came home he paraded
around in them. Now, in Florence it was not
the custom to go about expensively clad, so
there were many who made fun of him.</p>

<p>One night Taddeo and Raniero were out in
the wine shops. Taddeo was dressed in a green
cloak with sable linings, and a violet jacket.
Raniero tempted him to drink so much wine
that he fell asleep, and then he took his cloak
off him and hung it upon a scarecrow that was
set up in a cabbage patch.</p>

<p>When Francesca heard of this she was vexed
again with Raniero. That moment she saw
before her the big piece of gold cloth—which
was her love—and she seemed to see how it
diminished, as Raniero cut away piece after
piece.</p>

<p>After this, things were patched up between
them for a time, but Francesca was no longer
so happy as in former days, because she always
feared that Raniero would commit some misdemeanor
that would hurt her love.</p>

<p>This was not long in coming, either, for
Raniero could never be tranquil. He wished
that people should always speak of him and
praise his courage and daring.</p>

<p>At that time the cathedral in Florence was
much smaller than the present one, and there
hung at the top of one of its towers a big, heavy
shield, which had been placed there by one of
Francesca’s ancestors. It was the heaviest
shield any man in Florence had been able to lift,
and all the Uberti family were proud because
it was one of their own who had climbed up in
the tower and hung it there.</p>

<p>But Raniero climbed up to the shield one day,
hung it on his back, and came down with it.</p>

<p>When Francesca heard of this for the first
time she spoke to Raniero of what troubled
her, and begged him not to humiliate her family
in this way. Raniero, who had expected that
she would commend him for his feat, became
very angry. He retorted that he had long observed
that she did not rejoice in his success,
but thought only of her own kin. “It’s something
else I am thinking of,” said Francesca,
“and that is my love. I know not what will
become of it if you keep on in this way.”</p>

<p>After this they frequently exchanged harsh
words, for Raniero happened nearly always to
do the very thing that was most distasteful to
Francesca.</p>

<p>There was a workman in Raniero’s shop who
was little and lame. This man had loved Francesca
before she was married, and continued to
love her even after her marriage. Raniero, who
knew this, undertook to joke with him before
all who sat at a table. It went so far that
finally the man could no longer bear to be held
up to ridicule in Francesca’s hearing, so he
rushed upon Raniero and wanted to fight with
him. But Raniero only smiled derisively and
kicked him aside. Then the poor fellow
thought he did not care to live any longer, and
went off and hanged himself.</p>

<p>When this happened, Francesca and Raniero
had been married about a year. Francesca
thought continually that she saw her love before
her as a shimmery piece of cloth, but on
all sides large pieces were cut away, so that it
was scarcely half as big as it had been in the
beginning.</p>

<p>She became very much alarmed when she saw
this, and thought: “If I stay with Raniero another
year, he will destroy my love. I shall
become just as poor as I have hitherto been
rich.”</p>

<p>Then she concluded to leave Raniero’s house
and go to live with her father, that the day
might not come when she should hate Raniero
as much as she now loved him.</p>

<p>Jacopo degli Uberti was sitting at the loom
with all his workmen busy around him when he
saw her coming. He said that now the thing
had come to pass which he had long expected,
and bade her be welcome. Instantly he ordered
all the people to leave off their work and arm
themselves and close the house.</p>

<p>Then Jacopo went over to Raniero. He met
him in the workshop. “My daughter has this
day returned to me and begged that she may
live again under my roof,” he said to his son-in-law.
“And now I expect that you will not
compel her to return to you, after the promise
you have given me.”</p>

<p>Raniero did not seem to take this very seriously,
but answered calmly: “Even if I had
not given you my word, I would not demand
the return of a woman who does not wish to be
mine.”</p>

<p>He knew how much Francesca loved him,
and said to himself: “She will be back with
me before evening.”</p>

<p>Yet she did not appear either that day or the
next.</p>

<p>The third day Raniero went out and pursued
a couple of robbers who had long disturbed
the Florentine merchants. He succeeded
in catching them, and took them captives to
Florence.</p>

<p>He remained quiet a couple of days, until
he was positive that this feat was known
throughout the city. But it did not turn out as
he had expected—that it would bring Francesca
back to him.</p>

<p>Raniero had the greatest desire to appeal to
the courts, to force her return to him, but he
felt himself unable to do this because of his
promise. It seemed impossible for him to live
in the same city with a wife who had abandoned
him, so he moved away from Florence.</p>

<p>He first became a soldier, and very soon he
made himself commander of a volunteer company.
He was always in a fight, and served
many masters.</p>

<p>He won much renown as a warrior, as he had
always said he would. He was made a knight
by the Emperor, and was accounted a great
man.</p>

<p>Before he left Florence, he had made a vow
at a sacred image of the Madonna in the Cathedral
to present to the Blessed Virgin the best
and rarest that he won in every battle. Before
this image one always saw costly gifts, which
were presented by Raniero.</p>

<p>Raniero was aware that all his deeds were
known in his native city. He marveled much
that Francesca degli Uberti did not come back
to him, when she knew all about his success.</p>

<p>At that time sermons were preached to start
the Crusades for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre
from the Saracens, and Raniero took the
cross and departed for the Orient. He not only
hoped to win castles and lands to rule over, but
also to succeed in performing such brilliant
feats that his wife would again be fond of him,
and return to him.</p>

<p>The night succeeding the day on which Jerusalem
had been captured, there was great rejoicing
in the Crusaders’ camp, outside the city.
In almost every tent they celebrated with drinking
bouts, and noise and roystering were heard
in every direction.</p>

<p>Raniero di Raniero sat and drank with some
comrades; and in his tent it was even more hilarious
than elsewhere. The servants barely had
time to fill the goblets before they were empty
again.</p>

<p>Raniero had the best of reasons for celebrating,
because during the day he had won greater
glory than ever before. In the morning, when
the city was besieged, he had been the first to
scale the walls after Godfrey of Boulogne; and
in the evening he had been honored for his
bravery in the presence of the whole corps.</p>

<p>When the plunder and murder were ended,
and the Crusaders in penitents’ cloaks and with
lighted candles marched into the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, it had been announced to Raniero
by Godfrey that he should be the first who
might light his candle from the sacred candles
which burn before Christ’s tomb. It appeared
to Raniero that Godfrey wished in this manner
to show that he considered him the bravest man
in the whole corps; and he was very happy over
the way in which he had been rewarded for his
achievements.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, Raniero and his guests
were in the best of spirits; a fool and a couple
of musicians who had wandered all over the
camp and amused the people with their pranks,
came into Raniero’s tent, and the fool asked
permission to narrate a comic story.</p>

<p>Raniero knew that this particular fool was
in great demand for his drollery, and he promised
to listen to his narrative.</p>

<p>“It happened once,” said the fool, “that our
Lord and Saint Peter sat a whole day upon the
highest tower in Paradise Stronghold, and
looked down upon the earth. They had so
much to look at, that they scarcely found time
to exchange a word. Our Lord kept perfectly
still the whole time, but Saint Peter sometimes
clapped his hands for joy, and again turned his
head away in disgust. Sometimes he applauded
and smiled, and anon he wept and commiserated.
Finally, as it drew toward the close
of day, and twilight sank down over Paradise,
our Lord turned to Saint Peter and
said that now he must surely be satisfied
and content. ‘What is it that I should be content
with?’ Saint Peter asked, in an impetuous
tone. ‘Why,’ said our Lord slowly, ‘I thought
that you would be pleased with what you have
seen to-day.’ But Saint Peter did not care to
be conciliated. ‘It is true,’ said he, ‘that for
many years I have bemoaned the fact that Jerusalem
should be in the power of unbelievers,
but after all that has happened to-day, I think it
might just as well have remained as it was.’”</p>

<p>Raniero understood now that the fool spoke
of what had taken place during the day. Both
he and the other knights began to listen with
greater interest than in the beginning.</p>

<p>“When Saint Peter had said this,” continued
the fool, as he cast a furtive glance at the
knights, “he leaned over the pinnacle of the
tower and pointed toward the earth. He
showed our Lord a city which lay upon a great
solitary rock that shot up from a mountain valley.
‘Do you see those mounds of corpses?’
he said. ‘And do you see the naked and
wretched prisoners who moan in the night chill?
And do you see all the smoking ruins of the conflagration?’
It appeared as if our Lord did
not wish to answer him, but Saint Peter went on
with his lamentations. He said that he had certainly
been vexed with that city many times, but
he had not wished it so ill as that it should
come to look like this. Then, at last, our Lord
answered, and tried an objection: ‘Still, you
can not deny that the Christian knights have
risked their lives with the utmost fearlessness,’
said He.”</p>

<p>Then the fool was interrupted by bravos, but
he made haste to continue.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t interrupt me!” he said. “Now
I don’t remember where I left off—ah! to be
sure, I was just going to say that Saint Peter
wiped away a tear or two which sprang to his
eyes and prevented him from seeing. ‘I never
would have thought they could be such beasts,’
said he. ‘They have murdered and plundered
the whole day. Why you went to all the trouble
of letting yourself be crucified in order to
gain such devotees, I can’t in the least comprehend.’”</p>

<p>The knights took up the fun good-naturedly.
They began to laugh loud and merrily.
“What, fool! Is Saint Peter so wroth with
us?” shrieked one of them.</p>

<p>“Be silent now, and let us hear if our Lord
spoke in our defense!” interposed another.</p>

<p>“No, our Lord was silent. He knew of old
that when Saint Peter had once got a-going, it
wasn’t worth while to argue with him. He
went on in his way, and said that our Lord
needn’t trouble to tell him that finally they remembered
to which city they had come, and
went to church barefooted and in penitents’
garb. That spirit had, of course, not lasted
long enough to be worth mentioning. And
thereupon he leaned once more over the tower
and pointed downward toward Jerusalem. He
pointed out the Christians’ camp outside the
city. ‘Do you see how your knights celebrate
their victories?’ he asked. And our Lord saw
that there was revelry everywhere in the camp.
Knights and soldiers sat and looked upon
Syrian dancers. Filled goblets went the rounds
while they threw dice for the spoils of war
and——”</p>

<p>“They listened to fools who told vile
stories,” interpolated Raniero. “Was not this
also a great sin?”</p>

<p>The fool laughed and shook his head at Raniero,
as much as to say, “Wait! I will pay you
back.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t interrupt me!” he begged once
again. “A poor fool forgets so easily what he
would say. Ah! it was this: Saint Peter asked
our Lord if He thought these people were much
of a credit to Him. To this, of course, our
Lord had to reply that He didn’t think they
were.</p>

<p>“‘They were robbers and murderers before
they left home, and robbers and murderers they
are even to-day. This undertaking you could
just as well have left undone. No good will
come of it,’ said Saint Peter.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, fool!” said Raniero in a
threatening tone. But the fool seemed to consider
it an honor to test how far he could go
without some one jumping up and throwing him
out, and he continued fearlessly.</p>

<p>“Our Lord only bowed His head, like one
who acknowledges that he is being justly rebuked.
But almost at the same instant He
leaned forward eagerly and peered down with
closer scrutiny than before. Saint Peter also
glanced down. ‘What are you looking for?’
he wondered.”</p>

<p>The fool delivered this speech with much
animated facial play. All the knights saw our
Lord and Saint Peter before their eyes, and
they wondered what it was our Lord had
caught sight of.</p>

<p>“Our Lord answered that it was nothing in
particular,” said the fool. “Saint Peter gazed
in the direction of our Lord’s glance, but he
could discover nothing except that our Lord sat
and looked down into a big tent, outside of
which a couple of Saracen heads were set up on
long lances, and where a lot of fine rugs, golden
vessels, and costly weapons, captured in the
Holy City, were piled up. In that tent they
carried on as they did everywhere else in the
camp. A company of knights sat and emptied
their goblets. The only difference might be
that here there were more drinking and roystering
than elsewhere. Saint Peter could not
comprehend why our Lord was so pleased when
He looked down there, that His eyes fairly
sparkled with delight. So many hard and cruel
faces he had rarely before seen gathered around
a drinking table. And he who was host at the
board and sat at the head of the table was
the most dreadful of all. He was a man of
thirty-five, frightfully big and coarse, with a
blowsy countenance covered with scars and
scratches, calloused hands, and a loud, bellowing
voice.”</p>

<p>Here the fool paused a moment, as if he
feared to go on, but both Raniero and the
others liked to hear him talk of themselves, and
only laughed at his audacity. “You’re a daring
fellow,” said Raniero, “so let us see what
you are driving at!”</p>

<p>“Finally, our Lord said a few words,” continued
the fool, “which made Saint Peter understand
what He rejoiced over. He asked
Saint Peter if He saw wrongly, or if it could
actually be true that one of the knights had a
burning candle beside him.”</p>

<p>Raniero gave a start at these words. Now,
at last, he was angry with the fool, and reached
out his hand for a heavy wine pitcher to throw
at his face, but he controlled himself that he
might hear whether the fellow wished to speak
to his credit or discredit.</p>

<p>“Saint Peter saw now,” narrated the fool,
“that, although the tent was lighted mostly by
torches, one of the knights really had a burning
wax candle beside him. It was a long, thick
candle, one of the sort made to burn twenty-four
hours. The knight, who had no candlestick
to set it in, had gathered together some
stones and piled them around it, to make it
stand.”</p>

<p>The company burst into shrieks of laughter
at this. All pointed at a candle which stood on
the table beside Raniero, and was exactly like
the one the fool had described. The blood
mounted to Raniero’s head; for this was the
candle which he had a few hours before been
permitted to light at the Holy Sepulchre. He
had been unable to make up his mind to let it
die out.</p>

<p>“When Saint Peter saw that candle,” said
the fool, “it dawned upon him what it was that
our Lord was so happy over, but at the same
time he could not help feeling just a little sorry
for Him. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘it was the same
knight that leaped upon the wall this morning
immediately after the gentleman of Boulogne,
and who this evening was permitted to light his
candle at the Holy Sepulchre ahead of all the
others. ‘True!’ said our Lord. ‘And, as you
see, his candle is still burning.’”</p>

<p>The fool talked very fast now, casting an
occasional sly glance at Raniero. “Saint Peter
could not help pitying our Lord. ‘Can’t you
understand why he keeps that candle burning?’
said he. ‘You must believe that he thinks of
your sufferings and death whenever he looks at
it. But he thinks only of the glory which he
won when he was acknowledged to be the
bravest man in the troop after Godfrey.’”</p>

<p>At this all Raniero’s guests laughed. Raniero
was very angry, but he, too, forced himself
to laugh. He knew they would have found
it still more amusing if he hadn’t been able to
take a little fun.</p>

<p>“But our Lord contradicted Saint Peter,”
said the fool. “‘Don’t you see how careful he
is with the light?’ asked He. ‘He puts his
hand before the flame as soon as any one raises
the tent-flap, for fear the draught will blow it
out. And he is constantly occupied in chasing
away the moths which fly around it and threaten
to extinguish it.’”</p>

<p>The laughter grew merrier and merrier, for
what the fool said was the truth. Raniero
found it more and more difficult to control himself.
He felt he could not endure that any one
should jest about the sacred candle.</p>

<p>“Still, Saint Peter was dubious,” continued
the fool. “He asked our Lord if He knew that
knight. ‘He’s not one who goes often to Mass
or wears out the prie-dieu,’ said he. But our
Lord could not be swerved from His opinion.</p>

<p>“‘Saint Peter, Saint Peter,’ He said earnestly.
‘Remember that henceforth this knight shall
become more pious than Godfrey. Whence do
piety and gentleness spring, if not from my sepulchre?
You shall see Raniero di Raniero help
widows and distressed prisoners. You shall see
him care for the sick and despairing as he now
cares for the sacred candle flame.’”</p>

<p>At this they laughed inordinately. It struck
them all as very ludicrous, for they knew Raniero’s
disposition and mode of living. But he
himself found both the jokes and laughter intolerable.
He sprang to his feet and wanted to
reprove the fool. As he did this, he bumped so
hard against the table—which was only a door
set up on loose boxes—that it wabbled, and the
candle fell down. It was evident now how
careful Raniero was to keep the candle burning.
He controlled his anger and gave himself time
to pick it up and brighten the flame, before he
rushed upon the fool. But when he had
trimmed the light the fool had already darted
out of the tent, and Raniero knew it would be
useless to pursue him in the darkness. “I shall
probably run across him another time,” he
thought, and sat down.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guests had laughed mockingly,
and one of them turned to Raniero and
wanted to continue the jesting. He said:
“There is one thing, however, which is certain,
Raniero, and that is—this time you can’t send
to the Madonna in Florence the most precious
thing you have won in the battle.”</p>

<p>Raniero asked why he thought that he should
not follow his old habit this time.</p>

<p>“For no other reason,” said the knight,
“than that the most precious thing you have
won is that sacred candle flame, which you were
permitted to light at the church of the Holy
Sepulchre in presence of the whole corps.
Surely you can’t send that to Florence!”</p>

<p>Again the other knights laughed, but Raniero
was now in the mood to undertake the
wildest projects, just to put an end to their
laughter. He came to a conclusion quickly,
called to an old squire, and said to him: “Make
ready, Giovanni, for a long journey. To-morrow
you shall travel to Florence with this sacred
candle flame.”</p>

<p>But the squire said a blunt no to this command.
“This is something which I don’t care
to undertake,” he said. “How should it be
possible to travel to Florence with a candle
flame? It would be extinguished before I had
left the camp.”</p>

<p>Raniero asked one after another of his men.
He received the same reply from all. They
scarcely seemed to take his command seriously.</p>

<p>It was a foregone conclusion that the foreign
knights who were his guests should laugh
even louder and more merrily, as it became apparent
that none of Raniero’s men wished to
carry out his order.</p>

<p>Raniero grew more and more excited.
Finally he lost his patience and shouted: “This
candle flame shall nevertheless be borne to Florence;
and since no one else will ride there with
it, I will do so myself!”</p>

<p>“Consider before you promise anything of
the kind!” said a knight. “You ride away
from a principality.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you that I will carry this sacred
flame to Florence!” exclaimed Raniero. “I
shall do what no one else has cared to undertake.”</p>

<p>The old squire defended himself. “Master,
it’s another matter for you. You can take
with you a large retinue but me you would send
alone.”</p>

<p>But Raniero was clean out of himself, and
did not consider his words. “I, too, shall
travel alone,” said he.</p>

<p>But with this declaration Raniero had carried
his point. Every one in the tent had
ceased laughing. Terrified, they sat and stared
at him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you laugh any more?” asked
Raniero. “This undertaking surely can’t be
anything but a child’s game for a brave man.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The next morning at dawn Raniero mounted
his horse. He was in full armor, but over
it he had thrown a coarse pilgrim cloak,
so that the iron dress should not become
overheated by exposure to the sun’s rays.
He was armed with a sword and battle-club,
and rode a good horse. He held in his
hand a burning candle, and to the saddle he had
tied a couple of bundles of long wax candles,
so the flame should not die out for lack of
nourishment.</p>

<p>Raniero rode slowly through the long, encumbered
tent street, and thus far all went well.
It was still so early that the mists which had
arisen from the deep dales surrounding Jerusalem
were not dispersed, and Raniero rode forward
as in a white night. The whole troop
slept, and Raniero passed the guards easily.
None of them called out his name, for the mist
prevented their seeing him, and the roads were
covered with a dust-like soil a foot high, which
made the horse’s tramp inaudible.</p>

<p>Raniero was soon outside the camp and
started on the road which led to Joppa. Here
it was smoother, but he rode very slowly now,
because of the candle, which burned feebly in
the thick mist. Big insects kept dashing against
the flame. Raniero had all he could do guarding
it, but he was in the best of spirits and
thought all the while that the mission which he
had undertaken was so easy that a child could
manage it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the horse grew weary of the
slow pace, and began to trot. The flame began
to flicker in the wind. It didn’t help that Raniero
tried to shield it with his hand and with
the cloak. He saw that it was about to be extinguished.</p>

<p>But he had no desire to abandon the project
so soon. He stopped the horse, sat still a moment,
and pondered. Then he dismounted and
tried sitting backwards, so that his body
shielded the flame from the wind. In this way
he succeeded in keeping it burning; but he realized
now that the journey would be more difficult
than he had thought at the beginning.</p>

<p>When he had passed the mountains which
surround Jerusalem, the fog lifted. He rode
forward now in the greatest solitude. There
were no people, houses, green trees, nor plants—only
bare rocks.</p>

<p>Here Raniero was attacked by robbers.
They were idle folk, who followed the camp
without permission, and lived by theft and
plunder. They had lain in hiding behind a hill,
and Raniero—who rode backwards—had not
seen them until they had surrounded him and
brandished their swords at him.</p>

<p>There were about twelve men. They looked
wretched, and rode poor horses. Raniero saw
at once that it would not be difficult for him to
break through this company and ride on. And
after his proud boast of the night before, he
was unwilling to abandon his undertaking
easily.</p>

<p>He saw no other means of escape than to
compromise with the robbers. He told them
that, since he was armed and rode a good horse,
it might be difficult to overpower him if he defended
himself. And as he was bound by a
vow, he did not wish to offer resistance, but they
could take whatever they wanted, without a
struggle, if only they promised not to put out
his light.</p>

<p>The robbers had expected a hard struggle,
and were very happy over Raniero’s proposal,
and began immediately to plunder him. They
took from him armor and steed, weapons and
money. The only thing they let him keep was
the coarse cloak and the two bundles of wax
candles. They sacredly kept their promise,
also, not to put out the candle flame.</p>

<p>One of them mounted Raniero’s horse.
When he noticed what a fine animal he was, he
felt a little sorry for the rider. He called out
to him: “Come, come, we must not be too cruel
toward a Christian. You shall have my old
horse to ride.”</p>

<p>It was a miserable old screw of a horse. It
moved as stiffly, and with as much difficulty, as
if it were made of wood.</p>

<p>When the robbers had gone at last, and
Raniero had mounted the wretched horse, he
said to himself: “I must have become bewitched
by this candle flame. For its sake I
must now travel along the roads like a crazy
beggar.”</p>

<p>He knew it would be wise for him to turn
back, because the undertaking was really impracticable.
But such an intense yearning to
accomplish it had come over him that he could
not resist the desire to go on. Therefore, he
went farther. He saw all around him the same
bare, yellowish hills.</p>

<p>After a while he came across a goatherd, who
tended four goats. When Raniero saw the animals
grazing on the barren ground, he wondered
if they ate earth.</p>

<p>This goatherd had owned a larger flock,
which had been stolen from him by the Crusaders.
When he noticed a solitary Christian
come riding toward him, he tried to do him all
the harm he could. He rushed up to him and
struck at his light with his staff. Raniero was
so taken up by the flame that he could not defend
himself even against a goatherd. He only
drew the candle close to him to protect it. The
goatherd struck at it several times more, then
he paused, astonished, and ceased striking. He
noticed that Raniero’s cloak had caught fire,
but Raniero did nothing to smother the blaze,
so long as the sacred flame was in danger. The
goatherd looked as though he felt ashamed.
For a long time he followed Raniero, and in
one place, where the road was very narrow,
with a deep chasm on each side of it, he came
up and led the horse for him.</p>

<p>Raniero smiled and thought the goatherd
surely regarded him as a holy man who had
undertaken a voluntary penance.</p>

<p>Toward evening Raniero began to meet people.
Rumors of the fall of Jerusalem had already
spread to the coast, and a throng of people
had immediately prepared to go up there.
There were pilgrims who for years had awaited
an opportunity to get into Jerusalem, also some
newly-arrived troops; but they were mostly
merchants who were hastening with provisions.</p>

<p>When these throngs met Raniero, who came
riding backwards with a burning candle in his
hand, they cried: “A madman, a madman!”</p>

<p>The majority were Italians; and Raniero
heard how they shouted in his own tongue,
“Pazzo, pazzo!” which means “a madman,
a madman.”</p>

<p>Raniero, who had been able to keep himself
well in check all day, became intensely irritated
by these ever-recurring shouts. Instantly he
dismounted and began to chastise the offenders
with his hard fists. When they saw how heavy
the blows were, they took to their heels, and
Raniero soon stood alone on the road.</p>

<p>Now Raniero was himself again. “In truth
they were right to call me a madman,” he said,
as he looked around for the light. He did not
know what he had done with it. At last he saw
that it had rolled down into a hollow. The
flame was extinguished, but he saw fire gleam
from a dry grass-tuft close beside it, and understood
that luck was with him, for the flame had
ignited the grass before it had gone out.</p>

<p>“This might have been an inglorious end of
a deal of trouble,” he thought, as he lit the candle
and stepped into the saddle. He was rather
mortified. It did not seem to him very probable
that his journey would be a success.</p>

<p>In the evening Raniero reached Ramle, and
rode up to a place where caravans usually had
night harbor. It was a large covered yard.
All around it were little stalls where travelers
could put up their horses. There were no
rooms, but folk could sleep beside the animals.</p>

<p>The place was overcrowded with people, yet
the host found room for Raniero and his horse.
He also gave fodder to the horse and food to
the rider.</p>

<p>When Raniero perceived that he was well
treated, he thought: “I almost believe the robbers
did me a service when they took from me
my armor and my horse. I shall certainly
get out of the country more easily with my light
burden, if they mistake me for a lunatic.”</p>

<p>When he had led the horse into the stall, he
sat down on a sheaf of straw and held the candle
in his hands. It was his intention not to
fall asleep, but to remain awake all night.</p>

<p>But he had hardly seated himself when he
fell asleep. He was fearfully exhausted, and
in his sleep he stretched out full length and did
not wake till morning.</p>

<p>When he awoke he saw neither flame nor candle.
He searched in the straw for the candle,
but did not find it anywhere.</p>

<p>“Some one has taken it from me and extinguished
it,” he said. He tried to persuade himself
that he was glad that all was over, and that
he need not pursue an impossible undertaking.</p>

<p>But as he pondered, he felt a sense of emptiness
and loss. He thought that never before
had he so longed to succeed in anything on
which he had set his mind.</p>

<p>He led the horse out and groomed and saddled
it.</p>

<p>When he was ready to set out, the host who
owned the caravansary came up to him with a
burning candle. He said in Frankish: “When
you fell asleep last night, I had to take your
light from you, but here you have it again.”</p>

<p>Raniero betrayed nothing, but said very
calmly: “It was wise of you to extinguish it.”</p>

<p>“I have not extinguished it,” said the man.
“I noticed that it was burning when you arrived,
and I thought it was of importance to
you that it should continue to burn. If you see
how much it has decreased, you will understand
that it has been burning all night.”</p>

<p>Raniero beamed with happiness. He commended
the host heartily, and rode away in the
best of spirits.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <span class='larger'>IV</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Raniero broke away from the camp
at Jerusalem, he intended to travel from Joppa
to Italy by sea, but changed his mind after he
had been robbed of his money, and concluded
to make the journey by land.</p>

<p>It was a long journey. From Joppa he went
northward along the Syrian coast. Then he
rode westward along the peninsula of Asia
Minor, then northward again, all the way to
Constantinople. From there he still had a monotonously
long distance to travel to reach
Florence. During the whole journey Raniero
had lived upon the contributions of the pious.
They that shared their bread with him mostly
were pilgrims who at this time traveled <em>en
masse</em> to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Regardless of the fact that he nearly always
rode alone, his days were neither long nor monotonous.
He must always guard the candle
flame, and on its account he never could feel at
ease. It needed only a puff of breeze—a rain-drop—and
there would have been an end to it.</p>

<p>As Raniero rode over lonely roads, and
thought only about keeping the flame alive, it
occurred to him that once before he had been
concerned with something similar. Once
before he had seen a person watch over something
which was just as sensitive as a candle
flame.</p>

<p>This recollection was so vague to him at first
that he wondered if it was something he had
dreamed.</p>

<p>But as he rode on alone through the country,
it kept recurring to him that he had participated
in something similar once before.</p>

<p>“It is as if all my life long I had heard tell
of nothing else,” said he.</p>

<p>One evening he rode into a city. It was after
sundown, and the housewives stood in their
doorways and watched for their husbands.
Then he noticed one who was tall and slender,
and had earnest eyes. She reminded him of
Francesca degli Uberti.</p>

<p>Instantly it became clear to him what he had
been pondering over. It came to him that for
Francesca her love must have been as a sacred
flame which she had always wished to keep
burning, and which she had constantly feared
that Raniero would quench. He was astonished
at this thought, but grew more and more
certain that the matter stood thus. For the first
time he began to understand why Francesca had
left him, and that it was not with feats of arms
he should win her back.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>The journey which Raniero made was of
long duration. This was in part due to the fact
that he could not venture out when the weather
was bad. Then he sat in some caravansary,
and guarded the candle flame. These were
very trying days.</p>

<p>One day, when he rode over Mount Lebanon,
he saw that a storm was brewing. He was
riding high up among awful precipices, and a
frightful distance from any human abode.
Finally he saw on the summit of a rock the
tomb of a Saracen saint. It was a little square
stone structure with a vaulted roof. He thought
it best to seek shelter there.</p>

<p>He had barely entered when a snowstorm
came up, which raged for two days and nights.
At the same time it grew so cold that he came
near freezing to death.</p>

<p>Raniero knew that there were heaps of
branches and twigs out on the mountain, and it
would not have been difficult for him to gather
fuel for a fire. But he considered the candle
flame which he carried very sacred, and did not
wish to light anything from it, except the candles
before the Blessed Virgin’s Altar.</p>

<p>The storm increased, and at last he heard
thunder and saw gleams of lightning.</p>

<p>Then came a flash which struck the mountain,
just in front of the tomb, and set fire to a tree.
And in this way he was enabled to light his
fire without having to borrow of the sacred
flame.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>As Raniero was riding on through a desolate
portion of the Cilician mountain district, his
candles were all used up. The candles which
he had brought with him from Jerusalem had
long since been consumed; but still he had been
able to manage because he had found Christian
communities all along the way, of whom he had
begged fresh candles.</p>

<p>But now his resources were exhausted, and
he thought that this would be the end of his
journey.</p>

<p>When the candle was so nearly burned out
that the flame scorched his hand, he jumped
from his horse and gathered branches and dry
leaves and lit these with the last of the flame.
But up on the mountain there was very little
that would ignite, and the fire would soon burn
out.</p>

<p>While he sat and grieved because the sacred
flame must die, he heard singing down the road,
and a procession of pilgrims came marching up
the steep path, bearing candles in their hands.
They were on their way to a grotto where a
holy man had lived, and Raniero followed
them. Among them was a woman who was
very old and had difficulty in walking, and Raniero
carried her up the mountain.</p>

<p>When she thanked him afterwards, he made
a sign to her that she should give him her candle.
She did so, and several others also presented
him with the candles which they carried.
He extinguished the candles, hurried down the
steep path, and lit one of them with the last
spark from the fire lighted by the sacred flame.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>One day at the noon hour it was very warm,
and Raniero had lain down to sleep in a thicket.
He slept soundly, and the candle stood beside
him between a couple of stones. When he had
been asleep a while, it began to rain, and this
continued for some time, without his waking.
When at last he was startled out of his sleep,
the ground around him was wet, and he hardly
dared glance toward the light, for fear it might
be quenched.</p>

<p>But the light burned calmly and steadily in
the rain, and Raniero saw that this was because
two little birds flew and fluttered just above the
flame. They caressed it with their bills, and
held their wings outspread, and in this way they
protected the sacred flame from the rain.</p>

<p>He took off his hood immediately, and hung
it over the candle. Thereupon he reached out
his hand for the two little birds, for he had
been seized with a desire to pet them. Neither
of them flew away because of him, and he could
catch them.</p>

<p>He was very much astonished that the birds
were not afraid of him. “It is because they
know I have no thought except to protect that
which is the most sensitive of all, that they do
not fear me,” thought he.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Raniero rode in the vicinity of Nicæa, in
Bithynia. Here he met some western gentlemen
who were conducting a party of recruits to
the Holy Land. In this company was Robert
Taillefer, who was a wandering knight and a
troubadour.</p>

<p>Raniero, in his torn cloak, came riding along
with the candle in his hand, and the warriors
began as usual to shout, “A madman, a madman!”
But Robert silenced them, and addressed
the rider.</p>

<p>“Have you journeyed far in this manner?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I have ridden like this all the way from
Jerusalem,” answered Raniero.</p>

<p>“Has your light been extinguished many
times during the journey?”</p>

<p>“Still burns the flame that lighted the candle
with which I rode away from Jerusalem,”
responded Raniero.</p>

<p>Then Robert Taillefer said to him: “I am
also one of those who carry a light, and I would
that it burned always. But perchance you,
who have brought your light burning all the
way from Jerusalem, can tell me what I shall
do that it may not become extinguished?”</p>

<p>Then Raniero answered: “Master, it is a
difficult task, although it appears to be of slight
importance. This little flame demands of you
that you shall entirely cease to think of anything
else. It will not allow you to have any sweet-heart—in
case you should desire anything of
the sort—neither would you dare on account of
this flame to sit down at a revel. You can not
have aught else in your thoughts than just this
flame, and must possess no other happiness.
But my chief reason for advising you against
making the journey which I have weathered is
that you can not for an instant feel secure. It
matters not through how many perils you may
have guarded the flame, you can not for an instant
think yourself secure, but must ever expect
that the very next moment it may fail
you.”</p>

<p>But Robert Taillefer raised his head proudly
and answered: “What you have done for your
sacred flame I may do for mine.”</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Raniero arrived in Italy. One day he rode
through lonely roads up among the mountains.
A woman came running after him and begged
him to give her a light from his candle. “The
fire in my hut is out,” said she. “My children
are hungry. Give me a light that I may heat
my oven and bake bread for them!”</p>

<p>She reached for the burning candle, but Raniero
held it back because he did not wish that
anything should be lighted by that flame but the
candles before the image of the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p>Then the woman said to him: “Pilgrim,
give me a light, for the life of my children is
the flame which I am in duty bound to keep
burning!” And because of these words he permitted
her to light the wick of her lamp from
his flame.</p>

<p>Several hours later he rode into a town. It
lay far up on the mountain, where it was very
cold. A peasant stood in the road and saw the
poor wretch who came riding in his torn cloak.
Instantly he stripped off the short mantle which
he wore, and flung it to him. But the mantle
fell directly over the candle and extinguished
the flame.</p>

<p>Then Raniero remembered the woman who
had borrowed a light of him. He turned back
to her and had his candle lighted anew with
sacred fire.</p>

<p>When he was ready to ride farther, he said
to her: “You say that the sacred flame which
you must guard is the life of your children. Can
you tell me what name this candle’s flame bears,
which I have carried over long roads?”</p>

<p>“Where was your candle lighted?” asked
the woman.</p>

<p>“It was lighted at Christ’s sepulchre,” said
Raniero.</p>

<p>“Then it can only be called Gentleness and
Love of Humanity,” said she.</p>

<p>Raniero laughed at the answer. He thought
himself a singular apostle of virtues such as
these.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p>Raniero rode forward between beautiful blue
hills. He saw he was near Florence. He was
thinking that he must soon part with his light.
He thought of his tent in Jerusalem, which he
had left filled with trophies, and the brave soldiers
who were still in Palestine, and who would
be glad to have him take up the business of war
once more, and bear them on to new conquests
and honors.</p>

<p>Then he perceived that he experienced no
pleasure in thinking of this, but that his
thoughts were drawn in another direction.</p>

<p>Then he realized for the first time that he
was no longer the same man that had gone from
Jerusalem. The ride with the sacred flame had
compelled him to rejoice with all who were
peaceable and wise and compassionate, and to
abhor the savage and warlike.</p>

<p>He was happy every time he thought of people
who labored peacefully in their homes, and
it occurred to him that he would willingly move
into his old workshop in Florence and do beautiful
and artistic work.</p>

<p>“Verily this flame has recreated me,” he
thought. “I believe it has made a new man
of me.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c'>

  </div>
</div>

<p>It was Eastertide when Raniero rode into
Florence.</p>

<p>He had scarcely come in through the city
gate—riding backwards, with his hood drawn
down over his face and the burning candle in
his hand—when a beggar arose and shouted
the customary “Pazzo, pazzo!”</p>

<p>At this cry a street gamin darted out of a
doorway, and a loafer, who had had nothing
else to do for a long time than to lie and gaze
at the clouds, jumped to his feet. Both began
shouting the same thing: “Pazzo, pazzo!”</p>

<p>Now that there were three who shrieked,
they made a good deal of noise and so woke up
all the street urchins. They came rushing out
from nooks and corners. As soon as they saw
Raniero, in his torn coat, on the wretched horse,
they shouted: “Pazzo, pazzo!”</p>

<p>But this was only what Raniero was accustomed
to. He rode quietly up the street, seeming:
not to notice the shouters.</p>

<p>Then they were not content with merely
shouting, but one of them jumped up and tried
to blow out the light. Raniero raised the candle
on high, trying at the same time to prod his
horse, to escape the boys.</p>

<p>They kept even pace with him, and did
everything they could to put out the light.</p>

<p>The more he exerted himself to protect the
flame the more excited they became. They
leaped upon one another’s backs, puffed their
cheeks out, and blew. They flung their caps at
the candle. It was only because they were so
numerous and crowded on one another that
they did not succeed in quenching the flame.</p>

<p>This was the largest procession on the street.
People stood at the windows and laughed. No
one felt any sympathy with a madman, who
wanted to defend his candle flame. It was
church hour, and many worshipers were on
their way to Mass. They, too, stopped and
laughed at the sport.</p>

<p>But now Raniero stood upright in the saddle,
so that he could shield the candle. He looked
wild. The hood had fallen back and they saw
his face, which was wasted and pale, like a martyr’s.
The candle he held uplifted as high as
he could.</p>

<p>The entire street was one great swarm of
people. Even the older ones began to take part
in the play. The women waved their head-shawls
and the men swung their caps. Every
one worked to extinguish the light.</p>

<p>Raniero rode under the vine-covered balcony
of a house. Upon this stood a woman. She
leaned over the lattice-work, snatched the candle,
and ran in with it. The woman was Francesca
degli Uberti.</p>

<p>The whole populace burst into shrieks of
laughter and shouts, but Raniero swayed in his
saddle and fell to the street.</p>

<p>As soon as he lay there stricken and unconscious,
the street was emptied of people.</p>

<p>No one wished to take charge of the fallen
man. His horse was the only creature that
stopped beside him.</p>

<p>As soon as the crowds had got away from the
street, Francesca degli Uberti came out from
her house, with the burning candle in her hand.
She was still pretty; her features were gentle,
and her eyes were deep and earnest.</p>

<p>She went up to Raniero and bent over him.
He lay senseless, but the instant the candle light
fell upon his face, he moved and roused himself.
It was apparent that the candle flame had
complete power over him. When Francesca
saw that he had regained his senses, she said:
“Here is your candle. I snatched it from you,
as I saw how anxious you were to keep it
burning. I knew of no other way to help
you.”</p>

<p>Raniero had had a bad fall, and was hurt.
But now nothing could hold him back. He
began to raise himself slowly. He wanted to
walk, but wavered, and was about to fall. Then
he tried to mount his horse. Francesca helped
him. “Where do you wish to go?” she asked
when he sat in the saddle again. “I want to
go to the cathedral,” he answered. “Then I
shall accompany you,” she said, “for I’m going
to Mass.” And she led the horse for him.</p>

<p>Francesca had recognized Raniero the very
moment she saw him, but he did not see who
she was, for he did not take time to notice her.
He kept his gaze fixed upon the candle flame
alone.</p>

<p>They were absolutely silent all the way. Raniero
thought only of the flame, and of guarding
it well these last moments. Francesca could
not speak, for she felt she did not wish to be
certain of that which she feared. She could not
believe but that Raniero had come home insane.
Although she was almost certain of this, she
would rather not speak with him, in order to
avoid any positive assurance.</p>

<p>After a while Raniero heard some one weep
near him. He looked around and saw that it
was Francesca degli Uberti, who walked beside
him; and she wept. But Raniero saw her only
for an instant, and said nothing to her. He
wanted to think only of the sacred flame.</p>

<p>Raniero let her conduct him to the sacristy.
There he dismounted. He thanked Francesca
for her help, but looked all the while not upon
her, but on the light. He walked alone up to
the priests in the sacristy.</p>

<p>Francesca went into the church. It was Easter
Eve, and all the candles stood unlighted
upon the altars, as a symbol of mourning.
Francesca thought that every flame of hope
which had ever burned within her was now
extinguished.</p>

<p>In the church there was profound solemnity.
There were many priests at the altar. The
canons sat in a body in the chancel, with the
bishop among them.</p>

<p>By and by Francesca noticed there was commotion
among the priests. Nearly all who were
not needed to serve at Mass arose and went
out into the sacristy. Finally the bishop went,
too.</p>

<p>When Mass was over, a priest stepped up to
the chancel railing and began to speak to the
people. He related that Raniero di Raniero
had arrived in Florence with sacred fire from
Jerusalem. He narrated what the rider had
endured and suffered on the way. And he
praised him exceeding much.</p>

<p>The people sat spellbound and listened to
this. Francesca had never before experienced
such a blissful moment. “O God!” she sighed,
“this is greater happiness than I can bear.”
Her tears fell as she listened.</p>

<p>The priest talked long and well. Finally he
said in a strong, thrilling voice: “It may perchance
appear like a trivial thing now, that a
candle flame has been brought to Florence.
But I say to you: Pray God that He will send
Florence many bearers of Eternal Light; then
she will become a great power, and be extolled
as a city among cities!”</p>

<p>When the priest had finished speaking, the
entrance doors of the church were thrown open,
and a procession of canons and monks and
priests marched up the center aisle toward the
altar. The bishop came last, and by his side
walked Raniero, in the same cloak that he had
worn during the entire journey.</p>

<p>But when Raniero had crossed the threshold
of the cathedral, an old man arose and walked
toward him. It was Oddo, the father of the
journeyman who had once worked for Raniero,
and had hanged himself because of him.</p>

<p>When this man had come up to the bishop
and Raniero, he bowed to them. Thereupon
he said in such a loud voice that all in the
church heard him: “It is a great thing for
Florence that Raniero has come with sacred fire
from Jerusalem. Such a thing has never before
been heard of or conceived. For that reason
perhaps there may be many who will say that it
is not possible. Therefore, I beg that all the
people may know what proofs and witnesses
Raniero has brought with him, to assure us that
this is actually fire which was lighted in Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>When Raniero heard this he said: “God
help me! how can I produce witnesses? I have
made the journey alone. Deserts and mountain
wastes must come and testify for me.”</p>

<p>“Raniero is an honest knight,” said the
bishop, “and we believe him on his word.”</p>

<p>“Raniero must know himself that doubts
will arise as to this,” said Oddo. “Surely, he
can not have ridden entirely alone. His little
pages could certainly testify for him.”</p>

<p>Then Francesca degli Uberti rushed up to
Raniero. “Why need we witnesses?” said
she. “All the women in Florence would swear
on oath that Raniero speaks the truth!”</p>

<p>Then Raniero smiled, and his countenance
brightened for a moment. Thereupon he
turned his thoughts and his gaze once more
upon the candle flame.</p>

<p>There was great commotion in the church.
Some said that Raniero should not be allowed
to light the candles on the altar until his claim
was substantiated. With this many of his old
enemies sided.</p>

<p>Then Jacopo degli Uberti rose and spoke in
Raniero’s behalf. “I believe every one here
knows that no very great friendship has existed
between my son-in-law and me,” he said; “but
now both my sons and I will answer for him.
We believe he has performed this task, and we
know that one who has been disposed to carry
out such an undertaking is a wise, discreet, and
noble-minded man, whom we are glad to receive
among us.”</p>

<p>But Oddo and many others were not disposed
to let him taste of the bliss he was yearning for.
They got together in a close group and it was
easy to see that they did not care to withdraw
their demand.</p>

<p>Raniero apprehended that if this should develop
into a fight, they would immediately try
to get at the candle. As he kept his eyes steadily
fixed upon his opponents, he raised the candle
as high as he could.</p>

<p>He looked exhausted in the extreme, and distraught.
One could see that, although he
wished to hold out to the very last, he expected
defeat. What mattered it to him now if he
were permitted to light the candles? Oddo’s
word had been a death-blow. When doubt was
once awakened, it would spread and increase.
He fancied that Oddo had already extinguished
the sacred flame forever.</p>

<p>A little bird came fluttering through the
great open doors into the church. It flew
straight into Raniero’s light. He hadn’t time
to snatch it aside, and the bird dashed against
it and put out the flame.</p>

<p>Raniero’s arm dropped, and tears sprang to
his eyes. The first moment he felt this as a sort
of relief. It was better thus than if human beings
had killed it.</p>

<p>The little bird continued its flight into
the church, fluttering confusedly hither and
thither, as birds do when they come into a
room.</p>

<p>Simultaneously a loud cry resounded
throughout the church: “The bird is on fire!
The sacred candle flame has set its wings on
fire!”</p>

<p>The little bird chirped anxiously. For a few
moments it fluttered about, like a flickering
flame, under the high chancel arches. Then it
sank suddenly and dropped dead upon the Madonna’s
Altar.</p>

<p>But the moment the bird fell upon the Altar,
Raniero was standing there. He had forced
his way through the church, no one had been
able to stop him. From the sparks which destroyed
the bird’s wings he lit the candles before
the Madonna’s Altar.</p>

<p>Then the bishop raised his staff and proclaimed:
“God willed it! God hath testified
for him!”</p>

<p>And all the people in the church, both his
friends and opponents, abandoned their doubts
and conjectures. They cried as with one voice,
transported by God’s miracle: “God willed it!
God hath testified for him!”</p>

<p>Of Raniero there is now only a legend, which
says he enjoyed great good fortune for the remainder
of his days, and was wise, and prudent,
and compassionate. But the people of Florence
always called him Pazzo degli Ranieri, in remembrance
of the fact that they had believed
him insane. And this became his honorary
title. He founded a dynasty, which was named
Pazzi, and is called so even to this day.</p>

<p>It might also be worth mentioning that it
became a custom in Florence, each year at Easter
Eve, to celebrate a festival in memory of
Raniero’s home-coming with the sacred flame,
and that, on this occasion, they always let an
artificial bird fly with fire through the church.
This festival would most likely have been celebrated
even in our day had not some changes
taken place recently.</p>

<p>But if it be true, as many hold, that the bearers
of sacred fire who have lived in Florence and
have made the city one of the most glorious on
earth, have taken Raniero as their model, and
have thereby been encouraged to sacrifice, to
suffer and endure, this may here be left untold.</p>

<p>For what has been done by this light, which
in dark times has gone out from Jerusalem, can
neither be measured nor counted.</p>

</div>

<p>Not a rambling, hap-hazard collection but a vade-mecum
for youth from the ages of six or seven to sixteen or seventeen.
It opens with Nursery Rhymes and lullabies, progresses
through child rhymes and jingles to more mature
nonsense verse; then come fairy verses and Christmas
poems; then nature verse and favorite rhymed stories; then
through the trumpet and drum period (where an attempt
is made to teach true patriotism) to the final appeal of
“Life Lessons” and “A Garland of Gold” (the great
poems for all ages).</p>

<p>This arrangement secures sequence of sentiment and a
sort of cumulative appeal. Nearly all the children’s
classics are included, and along with them a body of verse
not so well known but almost equally deserving. There
are many real “finds,” most of which have never before
appeared in any anthology.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson has banished doleful and pessimistic
verse, and has dwelt on hope, courage, cheerfulness and
helpfulness. The book should serve, too, as an introduction
to the greater poems, informing taste for them and
appreciation of them, against the time when the boy or
girl, grown into youth and maiden, is ready to swim out
into the full current of English poetry.</p>

<p>An out-of-door story for girls which tells how Dorothea
Marden went, under protest, from the city to spend the
summer at a farm in the New Hampshire mountains; how she
met Jo Gifford from South Tuxboro, who had red hair, and
knew she shouldn’t like her, but did; how Dorothea and Jo, at
the farm, fell out with the young folks close by at Camp Comfort;
how they carried on the war, with varying success, and
how they were sorry that they did so, and how they were glad
in the end to make peace.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
