  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />OUR INJUSTICE TO DEATH</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>It has been well said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Death and death alone is what we
must consult about life; and not some
vague future or survival, where we shall
not be. It is our own end; and everything
happens in the interval between death
and now. Do not talk to me of those
imaginary prolongations which wield over
us the childish spell of number; do not
talk to me—to me who am to die outright—of
societies and peoples! There is no
reality, there is no true duration, save that
between the cradle and the grave. The
rest is mere bombast, show, delusion! They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>call me a master because of some magic
in my speech and thoughts; but I am a
frightened child in the presence of death!”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>That is where we stand. For us, death is
the one event that counts in our life and in
our universe. It is the point whereat all
that escapes our vigilance unites and conspires
against our happiness. The more our
thoughts struggle to turn away from it, the
closer do they press around it. The more we
dread it, the more dreadful it becomes, for
it but thrives on our fears. He who seeks
to forget it has his memory filled with it;
he who tries to shun it meets naught else.
It clouds everything with its shadow. But
though we think of death incessantly, we do
so unconsciously, without learning to know
death. We compel our attention to turn
its back upon it, instead of going to it with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>uplifted head. All the forces which might
avail to face death we exhaust in averting
our will from it. We deliver death into the
groping hands of instinct and we grant it
not one hour of our intelligence. Is it surprising
that the idea of death, which should
be the most perfect and the most luminous
of ideas—being the most persistent and the
most inevitable—remains the flimsiest and
the only one that is a laggard? How should
we know the one power which we never look
in the face? How could it have profited
by gleams kindled only to help us escape it?
To fathom its abysses, we wait until the most
enfeebled, the most disordered moments of
our life arrive. We do not think of death
until we have no longer the strength, I will
not say, to think, but even to breathe. A
man returning among us from another
century would have difficulty in recognizing,
in the depths of a present-day soul, the image
of his gods, of his duty, of his love or of his
universe; but the figure of death, when
everything has changed around it and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>even that which composes it and upon which
it depends has vanished, he would find
almost untouched, rough-drawn as it was by
our fathers, hundreds, nay, thousands of
years ago. Our intelligence, grown so bold
and active, has not worked upon this figure,
has not, so to speak, retouched it in any way.
Though we may no longer believe in the
tortures of the damned, all the vital cells of
the most sceptical among us are still steeped
in the appalling mystery of the Hebrew
Sheol, the pagan Hades, or the Christian
Hell. Though it may no longer be lighted
by very definite flames, the gulf still opens
at the end of life and, if less known, is all
the more formidable. And, therefore, when
the impending hour strikes to which we
dared not raise our eyes, everything fails us
at the same time. Those two or three uncertain
ideas whereon, without examining
them, we had meant to lean give way like
rushes beneath the weight of the last
minutes. In vain we seek a refuge among
reflexions that are illusive or are strange to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>us and do not know the roads to our heart.
No one awaits us on the last shore where all
is unprepared, where naught remains afoot
save terror.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>Bossuet, the great poet of the tomb, says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not worthy of a Christian”—and I
would add, of a man—“to postpone his
struggle with death until the moment when
it arrives to carry him off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It were a salutary thing for each of us to
work out his idea of death in the light of his
days and the strength of his intelligence and
stand by it. He would say to death:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know not who you are, or I would be
your master; but, in days when my eyes
saw clearer than to-day, I learnt what you
were not: that is enough to prevent you
from becoming mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He would thus bear, graven on his memory,
a tried image against which the last
agony would not prevail and from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the phantom-stricken eyes would draw fresh
comfort. Instead of the terrible prayer of
the dying, which is the prayer of the depths,
he would say his own prayer, that of the peaks
of his existence, where would be gathered,
like angels of peace, the most lucid, the most
rarefied thoughts of his life. Is not that the
prayer of prayers? After all, what is a true
and worthy prayer, if not the most ardent and
disinterested effort to reach and grasp the
unknown?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>

<p class='c008'>“The doctors and the priests,” said
Napoleon, “have long been making death
grievous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Bacon wrote:</p>
<p class='c011'>“<i>Pompa mortis magis terret quam mors
ipsa.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us, then, learn to look upon death as
it is in itself, free from the horrors of matter
and stripped of the terrors of the imagination.
Let us first get rid of all that goes before and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>does not belong to it. Thus, we impute to
it the tortures of the last illness; and that is
not just. Illnesses have nothing in common
with that which ends them. They form part
of life and not of death. We readily forget
the most cruel sufferings that restore us to
health; and the first sun of convalescence
destroys the most unbearable memories
of the chamber of pain. But let death
come; and at once we overwhelm it with
all the evil done before it. Not a tear but
is remembered and used as a reproach, not a
cry of pain but becomes a cry of accusation.
Death alone bears the weight of the errors of
nature or the ignorance of science that have
uselessly prolonged torments in whose name
we curse death because it puts a term to them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>In point of fact, whereas sicknesses belong
to nature or to life, the agony, which seems
peculiar to death, is wholly in the hands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>men. Now what we most dread is the awful
struggle at the end and especially the last,
terrible second of rupture which we shall
perhaps see approaching during long hours
of helplessness and which suddenly hurls us,
naked, disarmed, abandoned by all and
stripped of everything, into an unknown that
is the home of the only invincible terrors
which the soul of man has ever felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is doubly unjust to impute the torments
of that second to death. We shall see
presently in what manner a man of to-day, if
he would remain faithful to his ideas, should
picture to himself the unknown into which
death flings us. Let us confine ourselves
here to the last struggle. As science progresses,
it prolongs the agony which is the
most dreadful moment and the sharpest peak
of human pain and horror, for the watchers,
at least; for very often the consciousness of
him whom death, in Bossuet’s phrase, has
“brought to bay” is already greatly dulled
and perceives no more than the distant
murmur of the sufferings which it seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>be enduring. All doctors consider it their
first duty to prolong to the uttermost even
the cruellest pangs of the most hopeless
agony. Who has not, at the bedside of a
dying man, twenty times wished and not
once dared to throw himself at their feet and
implore them to show mercy? They are
filled with so great a certainty and the duty
which they obey leaves so little room for the
least doubt that pity and reason, blinded by
tears, curb their revolt and recoil before a
law which all recognize and revere as the
highest law of man’s conscience.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>6</h3>

<p class='c008'>One day, this prejudice will strike us as
barbarous. Its roots go down to the unacknowledged
fears left in the heart by
religions that have long since died out in the
intelligence of men. That is why the doctors
act as though they were convinced that there
is no known torture but is preferable to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>awaiting us in the unknown. They seem
persuaded that every minute gained amid the
most intolerable sufferings is snatched from
the incomparably more dreadful sufferings
which the mysteries of the hereafter reserve
for men; and, of two evils, to avoid that
which they know to be imaginary, they
choose the only real one. Besides, in thus
postponing the end of a torture, which,
as old Seneca says, is the best part of
that torture, they are but yielding to the
unanimous error which makes its enclosing
circle more iron-bound every day: the prolongation
of the agony increasing the horror
of death; and the horror of death demanding
the prolongation of the agony.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>

<p class='c008'>The doctors, on their side, say or might
say that, in the present stage of science, two
or three cases excepted, there is never a
certainty of death. Not to support life to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>its last limits, even at the cost of insupportable
torments, might be murder. Doubtless
there is not one chance in a hundred
thousand that the patient escape. No
matter. If that chance exist which, in the
majority of cases, will give but a few days, or,
at the utmost, a few months of a life that will
not be the real life, but much rather, as the
Romans called it, “an extended death,”
those hundred thousand useless torments
will not have been in vain. A single hour
snatched from death outweighs a whole
existence of tortures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here are, face to face, two values that
cannot be compared; and, if we mean to
weigh them in the same balance, we must
heap the scale which we see with all that
remains to us, that is to say, with every
imaginable pain, for at the decisive hour
this is the only weight which counts and which
is heavy enough to raise by a hair’s-breadth
the other scale that dips into what we do not
see and is loaded with the thick darkness of
another world.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
<h3 class='c007'>8</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Swollen by so many adventitious horrors,
the horror of death becomes such that,
without reasoning, we accept the doctors’
reasons. And yet there is one point on
which they are beginning to yield and to
agree. They are slowly consenting, when
there is no hope left, if not to deaden, at
least to dull the last agonies. Formerly,
none of them would have dared to do so;
and, even to-day, many of them hesitate and,
like misers, measure out miserly drops of
the clemency and peace which they ought to
lavish and which they grudge in their dread
of weakening the last resistance, that is to say,
the most useless and painful quiverings of
reluctant life refusing to give place to oncoming
rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not for me to decide whether their
pity might show greater daring. It is
enough to state once more that all this has
no concern with death. It happens before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>it and beneath it. It is not the arrival of
death, but the departure of life that is
appalling. It is not death, but life that we
must act upon. It is not death that attacks
life; it is life that wrongfully resists death.
Evils hasten up from every side at the approach
of death, but not at its call; and,
though they gather round it, they did not
come with it. Do you accuse sleep of the
fatigue that oppresses you if you do not
yield to it? All those strugglings, those
waitings, those tossings, those tragic cursings
are on the side of the slope to which we cling
and not on the other side. They are, for
that matter, accidental and temporary and
emanate only from our ignorance. All our
knowledge merely helps us to die a more
painful death than the animals that know
nothing. A day will come when science will
turn upon its error and no longer hesitate
to shorten our woes. A day will come when
it will dare and act with certainty; when
life, grown wiser, will depart silently at its
hour, knowing that it has reached its term,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>even as it withdraws silently every evening,
knowing that its task is done. Once the
doctor and the sick man have learnt what
they have to learn, there will be no physical
nor metaphysical reason why the advent of
death should not be as salutary as that of
sleep. Perhaps even, as there will be nothing
else to take into consideration, it will be
possible to surround death with profounder
ecstasies and fairer dreams. In any case and
from this day, with death once acquitted of
that which goes before, it will be easier to
look upon it without fear and to lighten that
which comes after.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>9</h3>

<p class='c008'>Death, as we usually picture it, has two
terrors looming behind it. The first has
neither face nor form and permeates the
whole region of our mind; the other is
more definite, more explicit, but almost as
powerful. The latter strikes all our senses.
Let us examine it first.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Even as we impute to death all the evils
that precede it, so do we add to the dread
which it inspires all that happens beyond it,
thus doing it the same injustice at its going
as at its coming. Is it death that digs our
graves and orders us to keep there that which
is made to disappear? If we cannot think
without horror of what befalls the beloved
in the grave, is it death or we that placed him
there? Because death carries the spirit to
some place unknown, shall we reproach it
with our bestowal of the body which it
leaves with us? Death descends into our
midst to change the place of a life or change
its form: let us judge it by what it does and
not by what we do before it comes and after
it is gone. For it is already far away when
we begin the frightful work which we try
hard to prolong to the very utmost, as though
we were persuaded that it is our only security
against forgetfulness. I am well aware that,
from any other than the human point of
view, this proceeding is very innocent; and
that, looked upon from a sufficient height,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>decomposing flesh is no more repulsive than
a fading flower or a crumbling stone. But,
when all is said, it offends our senses, shocks
our memory, daunts our courage, whereas it
would be so easy for us to avoid the foul
ordeal. Purified by fire, the remembrance
lives enthroned as a beautiful idea; and
death is naught but an immortal birth
cradled in flames. This has been well
understood by the wisest and happiest
nations in history. What happens in our
graves poisons our thoughts together with
our bodies. The figure of death, in the
imagination of men, depends before all upon
the form of burial; and the funeral rites
govern not only the fate of those who depart,
but also the happiness of those who stay,
for they raise in the ultimate background of
life the great image upon which men’s eyes
linger in consolation or despair.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
<h3 class='c007'>10</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There is, therefore, but one terror particular
to death: that of the unknown into
which it hurls us. In facing it, let us lose
no time in putting from our minds all that
the positive religions have left there. Let us
remember only that it is not for us to prove
that they are not proved, but for them to
establish that they are true. Now not one
of them brings us a proof before which an
honest intelligence can bow. Nor would it
suffice if that intelligence were able to bow;
for man lawfully to believe and thus to limit
his endless seeking, the proof would need to
be irresistible. The God offered to us by
the best and strongest of them has given us
our reason to employ loyally and fully, that
is to say, to try to attain, before all and in
all things, that which appears to be the
truth. Can He exact that we should accept,
in spite of it, a belief whose doubtfulness,
from the human point of view, is not denied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>by its wisest and most ardent defenders?
He only offers us a very uncertain story,
which, even if scientifically substantiated,
would be merely a beautiful lesson in
morality and which is buttressed by prophecies
and miracles no less doubtful. Must we
here call to mind that Pascal, to defend that
creed which was already tottering at a time
when it seemed at its zenith, vainly attempted
a demonstration the mere aspect of which
would be enough to destroy the last remnant
of faith in a wavering mind? Better than
any other, he knew the stock proofs of the
theologians, for they had been the sole study
of the last years of his life. If but one of
these proofs could have resisted examination,
his genius, one of the three or four most
profound and lucid geniuses ever known to
humanity, must have given it an irresistible
force. But he does not linger over these
arguments, whose weakness he feels too well;
he pushes them scornfully aside, he glories
and, in a manner, rejoices in their futility:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who then will blame Christians for not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>being able to give a reason for their faith,
those who profess a religion for which they
cannot give a reason? They declare, in
presenting it to the world, that it is a
foolishness, <i>stultitiam</i>; and then you complain
that they do not prove it! If they
proved it, they would not be keeping their
word; it is in being destitute of proofs that
they are not destitute of sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His solitary argument, the one to which he
clings desperately and devotes all the power
of his genius, is the very condition of man in
the universe, that incomprehensible medley
of greatness and wretchedness, for which
there is no accounting save by the mystery of
the first fall:</p>

<p class='c009'>“For man is more incomprehensible
without that mystery than the mystery itself
is incomprehensible to man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He is therefore reduced to establishing the
truth of the Scriptures by an argument
drawn from the very Scriptures in question;
and—what is more serious—to explain a
wide and great and indisputable mystery by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>another, small, narrow and crude mystery
that rests only upon the legend which it is
his business to prove. And, let us observe in
passing, it is a fatal thing to replace one
mystery by another and lesser mystery. In
the hierarchy of the unknown, mankind
always ascends from the smaller to the
greater. On the other hand, to descend
from the greater to the smaller is to relapse
into the condition of primitive man, who
carries his barbarism to the point of replacing
the infinite by a fetish or an amulet. The
measure of man’s greatness is the greatness of
the mysteries which he cultivates or on which
he dwells.</p>

<p class='c009'>To return to Pascal, he feels that everything
is crumbling around him; and so, in
the collapse of human reason, he at last offers
us the monstrous wager that is the supreme
avowal of the bankruptcy and despair of his
faith. God, he says, meaning his God and
the Christian religion with all its precepts
and all its consequences, exists or does not
exist. We are unable, by human arguments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to prove that He exists or that He does not
exist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible,
because, having neither
divisions nor bounds, He has no relation to
us. We are therefore incapable of knowing
either what He is or if He is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>God is or is not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But to which side shall we lean?
Reason can determine nothing about it.
There is an infinite gulf that separates us.
A game is played at the uttermost part of
this infinite distance, in which heads may
turn up or tails. Which will you wager?
There is no reason for betting on either one
or the other; you cannot reasonably defend
either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The correct course would be not to wager
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but you must wager: this is not a
matter for your will; you are launched in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not to wager that God exists means
wagering that He does not exist, for which He
will punish you eternally. What then do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>you risk by wagering, at all hazards, that He
exists? If He does not, you lose a few small
pleasures, a few wretched comforts of this
life, because your little sacrifice will not have
been rewarded; if He exists, you gain an
eternity of unspeakable happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘It is true, but, in spite of all, I am so
made that I cannot believe.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, follow the way in which
they began who believe and who at first
did not believe either, taking holy water,
having masses said, etc. That in itself will
make you believe and will reduce you to the
level of the beasts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But that is just what I am afraid of.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why? What have you to lose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly three centuries of apologetics have
not added one useful argument to that
terrible and despairing page of Pascal.
And this is all that human intelligence has
found to compel our life. If the God who
demands our faith will not have us decide
by our reason, by what then must our choice
be made? By usage? By the accidents of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>race or birth, by some æsthetic or sentimental
pitch-and-toss? Or has He set within us
another higher and surer faculty before
which the understanding must yield? If
so, where is it? What is its name? If this
God punishes us for not having blindly
followed a faith that does not force itself
irresistibly upon the intelligence which He
gave us; if He chastises us for not having
made, in the presence of the great enigma
with which He confronts us, a choice which
is rejected by that best and most divine part
which He has implanted in us, we have
nothing left to reply: we are the dupes of
a cruel and incomprehensible sport, we are
the victims of a terrible snare and an immense
injustice; and, whatever the torments wherewith
that injustice may load us, they will be
less intolerable than the eternal presence of
its Author.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />ANNIHILATION</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>And now we stand before the abyss. It
is void of all the dreams with which our
fathers peopled it. They thought that they
knew what was there; we know only what
is not there. It is the vaster by all that we
have learnt to know nothing of. While
waiting for a scientific certainty to break
through its darkness—for man has the
right to hope for that which he does
not yet conceive—the only point that
interests us, because it is situated in the
little circle which our actual intelligence
traces in the thickest blackness of the
night, is to know whether the unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>for which we are bound will be dreadful
or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside the religions, there are four
imaginable solutions and no more: total
annihilation; survival with our consciousness
of to-day; survival without any sort of
consciousness; lastly, survival in the universal
consciousness, or with a consciousness
different from that which we possess in this
world.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>Total annihilation is impossible. We are
the prisoners of an infinity without outlet,
wherein nothing perishes, wherein everything
is dispersed, but nothing lost. Neither
a body nor a thought can drop out of the
universe, out of time and space. Not an
atom of our flesh, not a quiver of our nerves
will go where they will cease to be, for there
is no place where anything ceases to be. The
brightness of a star extinguished millions of
years ago still wanders in the ether where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>our eyes will perhaps behold it this very night,
pursuing its endless road. It is the same
with all that we see, as with all that we do
not see. To be able to do away with a thing,
that is to say, to fling it into nothingness,
nothingness would have to exist; and, if it
exists, under whatever form, it is no longer
nothingness. As soon as we try to analyze
it, to define it, or to understand it, thoughts
and expressions fail us, or create that which
they are struggling to deny. It is as contrary
to the nature of our reason and probably of all
imaginable reason to conceive nothingness
as to conceive limits to infinity. Nothingness,
besides, is but a negative infinity, a
sort of infinity of darkness opposed to that
which our intelligence strives to illumine, or
rather it is but a child-name or nickname
which our mind has bestowed upon that
which it has not attempted to embrace,
for we call nothingness all that escapes
our senses or our reason and exists without
our knowledge.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But, it will perhaps be said, though the
annihilation of every world and every thing
be impossible, it is not so certain that their
death is impossible; and, to us, what is the
difference between nothingness and everlasting
death? Here again we are led astray
by our imagination and by words. We can
no more conceive death than we can conceive
nothingness. We use the word death to cover
those fragments of nothingness which we believe
that we understand; but, on closer examination,
we are bound to recognize that
our idea of death is much too puerile for it to
contain the least truth. It reaches no higher
than our own bodies and cannot measure
the destinies of the universe. We give the
name of death to anything that has a life a
little different from ours. Even so do we act
towards a world that appears to us motionless
and frozen, the moon, for instance,
because we are persuaded that any form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>existence, animal or vegetable, is extinguished
upon it for ever. But it is now some years
since we learnt that the most inert matter,
to outward seeming, is animated by movements
so powerful and furious that all animal
or vegetable life is no more than sleep and
immobility by the side of the swirling eddies
and immeasurable energy locked up in a
wayside stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no room for death!” cried
Emily Brontë.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, even if, in the infinite series of the
centuries, all matter should really become
inert and motionless, it would none the less
persist under one form or another; and
persistence, though it were in total immobility,
would, after all, be but a form of life
stable and silent at last. All that dies falls
into life; and all that is born is of the same
age as that which dies. If death carried us
to nothingness, did birth then draw us out
of that same nothingness? Why should
the second be more impossible than the first?
The higher human thought rises and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>wider it expands, the less comprehensible
do nothingness and death become. In any
case—and this is what matters here—if
nothingness were possible, since it could not
be anything whatever, it could not be
dreadful.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE SURVIVAL OF OUR<br />CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>Next comes survival with our consciousness
of to-day. I have broached
this question in an essay on <i>Immortality</i>,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
of which I will only reproduce a few essential
passages, restricting myself to supporting
them with new considerations.</p>

<p class='c009'>What composes this sense of the ego which
turns each of us into the centre of the
universe, the only point that matters in
space and time? Is it formed of sensations
of our body, or of thoughts independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of our body? Would our body be conscious
of itself without our mind? And, on the
other hand, what would our mind be without
our body? We know bodies without mind,
but no mind without a body. It is almost
certain that an intelligence devoid of senses,
devoid of organs to create and nourish it,
exists; but it is impossible to imagine that
ours could thus exist and yet remain similar
to that which has derived all that inspires it
from our sensibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>This ego, as we conceive it when we reflect
upon the consequences of its destruction,
this ego, therefore, is neither our mind nor
our body, since we recognize that both are
waves that roll by and are incessantly renewed.
Is it an immovable point, which
could not be form or substance, for these are
always in evolution, nor yet life, which is the
cause or effect of form and substance? In
truth, it is impossible for us either to apprehend
or define it, or even to say where it
dwells. When we try to go back to its last
source, we find little more than a succession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of memories, a mass of ideas, confused, for
that matter, and unsettled, all connected
with the same instinct, the instinct of
living: a mass of habits of our sensibility
and of conscious or unconscious reactions
against the surrounding phenomena. When
all is said, the most steadfast point of that
nebula is our memory, which seems, on the
other hand, to be a somewhat external, a
somewhat accessory faculty and, in any case,
one of the frailest faculties of our brain, one
of those which disappear the most promptly
at the least disturbance of our health. As
an English poet has very truly said, “that
which cries aloud for eternity is the very
part of me that will perish.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>It matters not: that uncertain, indiscernible,
fleeting and precarious ego is so
much the centre of our being, interests us
so exclusively, that every reality disappears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>before this phantom. It is utterly indifferent
to us that, throughout eternity, our body or
its substance should know every joy and
every glory, undergo the most splendid and
delightful transformations, become flower,
perfume, beauty, light, air, star—and it is
certain that it does so become and that we
must look for our dead not in our graveyards,
but in space and light and life—it is
likewise indifferent to us that our intelligence
should expand until it takes part in the life
of the worlds, until it understands and governs
it. We are persuaded that all this will not
affect us, will give us no pleasure, will not
happen to ourselves, unless that memory of a
few almost always insignificant facts accompany
us and witness those unimaginable joys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I care not,” says this narrow ego, in its
firm resolve to understand nothing, “I care
not if the loftiest, the freest, the fairest
portions of my mind be eternally living and
radiant in the supreme gladnesses: they are
no longer mine; I do not know them.
Death has cut the network of nerves or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>memories that connected them with I know
not what centres wherein lies the point which
I feel to be my very self. They are thus set
loose, floating in space and time; and their
fate is as alien to me as that of the most
distant stars. All that befalls has no existence
for me unless I can recall it within that
mysterious being which is I know not where
and precisely nowhere and which I turn like
a mirror about this world whose phenomena
take shape only in so far as they are reflected
in it.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>Thus our longing for immortality destroys
itself while expressing itself, since it is on
one of the accessory and most transient parts
of our whole life that we base all the interest
of our after-life. It seems to us that, if our
existence be not continued with the greater
part of its drawbacks, of the pettiness and
blemishes that characterize it, nothing will
distinguish it from that of other beings;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>that it will become a drop of ignorance
in the ocean of the unknown; and that,
thenceforth, all that may come to pass will
no longer concern us.</p>

<p class='c009'>What immortality can one promise to men
who almost necessarily conceive it in this
guise? What is the use of it? asks a puerile
but profound instinct. Any immortality
that does not drag with it through eternity,
like the fetters of the convict that we were,
the strange consciousness formed during a
few years of movement, any immortality
that does not bear that indelible mark of our
identity is for us as though it were not. Most
of the religions have been well aware of this
and have reckoned with that instinct which
desires and at the same time destroys the
after-life. It is thus that the Catholic
Church, going back to the most primitive
hopes, promises us not only the integral
preservation of our earthly ego, but even
the resurrection of our own flesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>There lies the crux of the riddle. When
we demand that this small consciousness, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>this sense of a special ego—almost childish
and, in any case, extraordinarily limited;
probably an infirmity of our actual intelligence—should
accompany us into the
infinity of time in order that we may
understand and enjoy it, are we not wishing
to perceive an object with the aid of an organ
which is not intended for that purpose?
Are we not asking that our hand should
discover the light or that our eye should
appreciate perfumes? Are we not, rather,
acting like a sick man who, in order to
recognize himself, to be quite sure that he is
himself, should think it necessary to continue
his sickness in health and in the unending
sequence of his days? The comparison, indeed,
is more accurate than is the habit of
comparisons. Picture a blind man who is
also paralyzed and deaf. He has been in this
condition from his birth and has just attained
his thirtieth year. What can the hours have
embroidered on the imageless web of this
poor life? The unhappy man must have
gathered at the back of his memory, for lack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of other recollections, a few halting sensations
of heat and cold, of weariness and
rest, of more or less active physical sufferings,
of hunger and thirst. It is probable that all
human joys, all our hopes and ideals, all our
dreams of paradise will be reduced for him
to the vague sense of well-being that follows
the alleviation of a pain. There you
have the only possible equipment of that
consciousness and that ego. The intellect,
having never been invoked from without,
will sleep soundly, all-ignorant of itself.
Nevertheless, the poor wretch will have his
little life, to which he will cling as closely
and eagerly as though he were the happiest
of men. He will dread death; and the idea
of entering into eternity without carrying
with him the emotions and the memories
of his dark and silent sick-bed will plunge
him into the same despair into which we
are plunged by the thought of abandoning
a glorious life of light and love for the icy
darkness of the tomb.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Let us now suppose that a miracle
suddenly quicken his eyes and ears and
reveal to him, through the open window
by his bedside, the dawn rising over
the plain, the song of the birds in the
trees, the murmur of the wind among
the leaves and of the water lapping its
banks, the echoing of human voices among
the morning hills. Let us suppose also that
the same miracle, completing its work,
restore the use of his limbs. He rises,
stretches his arms to that prodigy which as
yet for him possesses neither reality nor
name: the light! He opens the door,
staggers out amidst the effulgence; and his
whole body is merged in the wonder of it
all. He enters into an ineffable life, into a
sky whereof no dream could have given him
a foretaste; and, by a freak which is readily
admissible in this sort of cure, health, introducing
him to this inconceivable and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>unintelligible existence, wipes out in him all
memory of days past.</p>

<p class='c009'>What will be the state of this ego, of this
central focus, the receptacle of all our sensations,
the spot in which converges all that
belongs in its own right to our life, the
supreme point, the “egotic” point of our
being, if I may venture to coin a word?
Memory being abolished, will that ego recover
within itself a few traces of the man
that was? A new force, the intellect,
awaking and suddenly displaying unprecedented
activity, what relation will that
intellect keep up with the inert, dull germ
whence it has sprung? Where, in his past,
shall the man fix his moorings so that his identity
may endure? And yet will there not
survive within him some sense or instinct,
independent of his memory, his intellect and
I know not what other faculties, that will
make him recognize that it is indeed in him
that the liberating miracle has been wrought,
that it is indeed his life and not his neighbour’s,
transformed, irrecognizable, but substantially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the same, that has issued from the
silence and the darkness to prolong itself in
harmony and light? Can we picture the
disorder, the wandering hither and thither
of that bewildered consciousness? Have we
any idea in what manner the ego of yesterday
will unite with the ego of to-day and how
the “egotic” point, the only point which we
are anxious to preserve intact, will behave
in that delirium and that upheaval?</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us first endeavour to reply with
sufficient precision to this question which
comes within the province of our actual and
visible life; for, if we are unable to do this,
how can we hope to solve the other problem
that stares every man in the face at the
hour of death?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>This sensitive point, in which the whole
problem is summed up—for it is the only one
in question; and, except in so far as it
is concerned, immortality is certain—this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>mysterious point, to which, in the presence
of death, we attach so high a value, we lose,
strange to say, at any moment in life without
feeling the least anxiety. Not only is it
destroyed nightly in our sleep, but even in
waking it is at the mercy of a host of accidents.
A wound, a shock, an illness, a little alcohol,
a little opium, a little smoke are enough to
affect it. Even when nothing impairs it, it
is not uniformly perceptible. An effort is
often necessary, a deliberate looking into
ourselves, before we can recover it and
become aware of some particular event. At
the least distraction, a joy passes by us
without touching us, without giving up the
pleasure which it contains. One would say
that the functions of that organ by which we
taste and know life are intermittent and that
the presence of our ego, except in pain, is
but a rapid and perpetual sequence of
departures and returns. What reassures us
is that we think ourselves certain to find it
intact on awaking, after the wound, the
shock or the distraction, whereas we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>persuaded, so fragile do we feel it to be,
that it is bound to disappear for ever in the
awful impact between life and death.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>6</h3>

<p class='c008'>One foremost truth, pending others which
the future will no doubt reveal, is that,
in these questions of life and death, our
imagination has remained very childish.
Almost every elsewhere, it is ahead of
reason; but here it still loiters over the
games of infancy. It surrounds itself with
the barbaric dreams and longings wherewith
it cradled the hopes and fears of cave-dwelling
man. It asks for things that are
impossible because they are too small. It
clamours for privileges which, if obtained,
were more to be dreaded than the most
enormous disasters with which nihility
threatens us. Can we think without shuddering
of an eternity contained wholly
within our paltry present-day consciousness?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>And behold how, in all this, we obey the
illogical whims of fancy, which men in the
olden time called <i>la folle du logis</i>. Which of
us, if he were to go to sleep to-night in the
scientific certainty of awaking in a hundred
years exactly as he is to-day, with his body intact,
even on condition that he lost all memory
of his previous life—would such memories not
be useless?—which of us would not welcome
that age-long sleep with the same confidence
as the brief, gentle slumbers of his every
night? And yet between real death and this
sleep there would be only the difference
of that awakening deferred for a century,
an awakening as alien to the sleeper
as the birth of a posthumous child would
be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or else, to say very much what Schopenhauer
said to one who was unwilling to
admit an immortality into which he would
not carry his consciousness:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose that, to snatch you from some
intolerable suffering, you were promised an
awakening and a return to consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>after a wholly unconscious sleep of three
months?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I would accept it gladly.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose that, at the end of the three
months, they forgot you and did not wake
you until ten thousand years had passed,
how much the wiser would you be? And,
sleep once begun, what difference does it make
to you whether it last for three months or for
ever?”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>

<p class='c008'>Let us then consider that all that composes
our consciousness comes first of all
from our body. Our mind does but organize
that which is supplied by our senses;
and even the images and the words—which
in reality are but images—by the aid of
which it strives to sever itself from those
senses and deny their sway are borrowed
from them. How could that mind remain
what it was, when it has nothing left of that
which formed it? When our mind no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>longer has a body, what shall it carry with
it into infinity whereby to recognize itself,
seeing that it knows itself only by favour
of that body? A few memories of their
common life? Will those memories, which
were already fading in this world, suffice to
separate it for ever from the rest of the
universe, in boundless space and in unlimited
time?</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” I shall be told, “there is more in us
than our intelligence discovers. We have
many things within us which our senses have
not placed there; we contain a greater being
than the one we know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That is probable, nay, certain: the share
occupied by the inconscient, that is to say,
by that which represents the universe, is
enormous and preponderant. But how shall
the ego which we know and whose destiny
alone concerns us recognize all those things
and that greater being neither of which it
has ever known? What will it do in the
presence of that stranger? If I be told that
the stranger is myself, I will readily agree;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>but was that which upon earth felt and
weighed my joys and sorrows and gave birth
to the few memories and thoughts that
remain to me, was that this impassive,
unseen stranger who existed in me all unsuspected,
even as I am probably about to
live in him without his concerning himself
with a presence that will bring him but the
sorry recollection of a thing that has ceased to
be? Now that he has taken my place, while
destroying, in order to acquire a larger
consciousness, all that formed my small
consciousness here below, is it not another
life commencing, a life whose joys and
sorrows will pass above my head, not even
brushing with their new-born wings the
being which I am conscious of to-day?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>8</h3>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, how shall we explain that, in that
consciousness which ought to survive us, the
infinity that precedes our birth has left no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>trace? Had we no consciousness in that
infinity, or did we perchance lose it on
coming into the world and did the catastrophe
that produces the whole terror of
death take place at the moment of our
birth? None can deny that this infinity
has the same rights over us as that which
follows our decease. We are as much the
children of the first as of the second; and
we must of necessity have a part in both.
If you maintain that you will always exist,
you are bound to admit that you have always
existed; we cannot imagine the one without
having to imagine the other. If nothing
ends, nothing begins, for any such beginning
would be the end of something. Now,
although I have existed since all time, I
have no consciousness whatever of my
previous existence, whereas I shall have to
carry to the boundless horizon of the endless
ages the tiny consciousness acquired during
the instant that elapses between my birth
and my death. Can my true ego, then,
which is about to become eternal, date only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>from my short sojourn on this earth? And
all the preceding eternity, which is of exactly
the same value as that which follows, since
it is the same, shall it not count? Will it
be flung into nihility? Why is a strange
privilege accorded to a few meaningless days
spent on an unimportant planet? Is it
because in that previous eternity we had no
consciousness? What do we know about it?
It seems very unlikely. Why should the
acquisition of consciousness be a phenomenon
unrepeated in an eternity that had at its
disposal innumerable billions of chances,
among which—unless we set a limit to the
infinity of the ages—it is impossible to
conceive that the thousands of coincidences
which went to form my present consciousness
did not occur over and over again? The
moment we turn our gaze upon the mysteries
of that eternity wherein all that happens
must already have happened, it seems much
more credible, on the contrary, that we have
had consciousness upon consciousness which
our life of to-day hides from our view. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>they have existed and if, at our death, one
consciousness must survive, the others must
survive as well, for there is no reason to
bestow so disproportionate a favour upon
that consciousness which we have acquired
here below. And, if all of them survive and
awaken at the same time, what will become
of the petty consciousness of a few terrestrial
moments, when it is submerged in those
eternal existences? Besides, even if it were
to forget all its previous existences, what
would become of it amid the perpetual
buffeting, the endless wash of its posthumous
eternity? For it is but as a poor sand-drift
of an island in the unrelenting jaws of
two boundless oceans. It would hold its
own there, puny and so precarious, only on
condition that it acquired nothing more,
that it remained for ever closed, isolated and
confined, impenetrable and insensible to all
things, in the midst of the astounding
mysteries, the fabulous treasures and visions
which it would have eternally to pass
through without ever seeing or hearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>anything; and that surely would be the
worst death and the worst destiny that
could befall us. We are, therefore, driven
on all sides towards the theories of an
universal consciousness or of a modified consciousness,
both of which we shall examine
presently.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE THEOSOPHICAL HYPOTHESIS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>But, before broaching those questions,
it were perhaps well to study two
interesting solutions of the problem of
personal survival, solutions which, although
not new, have at least been lately renewed.
I refer to the neotheosophical and neospiritualistic
theories, which are, I think,
the only ones that can be seriously discussed.
The first is almost as old as man himself; but
a popular movement, of some magnitude in
certain countries, has rejuvenated the doctrine
of reincarnation, or the transmigration
of souls, and brought it once more into
prominence. It cannot be denied that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>all the religious theories, reincarnation is the
most plausible and the least repellent to our
reason. Nor must we overlook that it has
on its side the authority of the most ancient
and widespread religions, those which have
incontestably furnished humanity with the
greatest aggregate of wisdom and which we
have not yet exhausted of their truths and
mysteries. In reality, the whole of Asia,
whence we derive almost everything which
we know, has always believed and still
believes in the transmigration of souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Mrs. Annie Besant, the remarkable
apostle of the new theosophy, very rightly
says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no philosophical doctrine which
has behind it so magnificent an intellectual
ancestry as the doctrine of reincarnation;
none for which there is such a weight of the
opinion of the wisest of men; none, as Max
Müller declared, on which the greatest
philosophers of humanity have been so
thoroughly in accord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is all quite true. But it would need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>other proofs to win our distrustful faith
to-day. I have sought in vain for a single
one in the leading works of our modern
theosophists. They confine themselves to a
mere reiteration of dogmatic statements,
which are of the vaguest. Their great
argument—the chief and, when all is said,
the only argument which they adduce—is
but a sentimental argument. Their doctrine
that the soul, in its successive existences, is
purified and exalted with more or less rapidity
according to its efforts and deserts is, they
maintain, the only one that satisfies the
irresistible instinct of justice which we bear
within us. They are right; and, from this
point of view, their posthumous justice is
immeasurably superior to that of the barbaric
Heaven and the monstrous Hell of the
Christians, where rewards and punishments
are for ever meted out to virtues and vices
which are for the most part puerile, unavoidable
or accidental. But this, I repeat,
is only a sentimental argument, which has but
an infinitesimal value in the scale of evidence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We may admit that certain of their theories
are rather ingenious; and what they say of the
part played by the “shells,” for instance, or
the “elementals,” in the spiritualistic phenomena,
is worth about as much as our clumsy
explanations of fluidic and supersensible
bodies. Perhaps, or even no doubt, they
are right when they insist that everything
around us is full of living, sentient forms, of
diverse and innumerous types, “as different
from one another as a blade of grass and a
tiger, or a tiger and a man,” which are
incessantly brushing against us and through
which we pass unawares. If all the religions
have overpopulated the world with invisible
beings, we have perhaps depopulated it too
completely; and it is extremely possible that
we shall find one day that the mistake was not
on the side which one imagines. As Sir
William Crookes so well puts it, in a remarkable
passage:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“It is not improbable that other sentient
beings have organs of sense which do not
respond to some or any of the rays to which
our eyes are sensitive, but are able to appreciate
other vibrations to which we are
blind. Such beings would practically be
living in a different world to our own.
Imagine, for instance, what idea we should
form of surrounding objects were we endowed
with eyes not sensitive to the ordinary
rays of light but sensitive to the vibrations
concerned in electric and magnetic phenomena.
Glass and crystal would be among
the most opaque of bodies. Metals would
be more or less transparent, and a telegraph
wire through the air would look
like a long narrow hole drilled through
an impervious solid body. A dynamo in
active work would resemble a conflagration,
whilst a permanent magnet would realise
the dream of mediaeval mystics and become
an everlasting lamp with no
expenditure of energy or consumption
of fuel.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>All this, with so many other things which
they assert, would be, if not admissible, at
least worthy of attention, if those suppositions
were offered for what they are, that
is to say, very ancient hypotheses that go
back to the early ages of human theology
and metaphysics; but, when they are
transformed into categorical and dogmatic
assertions, they at once become untenable.
Their exponents promise us, on the other
hand, that, by exercising our minds, by
refining our senses, by etherealizing our
bodies, we shall be able to live with those
whom we call dead and with the higher
beings that surround us. It all seems to lead
to nothing very much and rests on very frail
bases, on very vague proofs derived from
hypnotic sleep, presentiments, mediumism,
phantasms and so forth. It is rather surprising
that those who call themselves
“clairvoyants,” who pretend to be in
communication with this world of discarnate
spirits and with other worlds still nearer to
the divine, bring us no evidential proofs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>We want something more than arbitrary
theories about the “immortal triad,” the
“three worlds,” the “astral body,” the
“permanent atom,” or the “Karma-Loka.”
As their sensibility is keener, their perception
subtler, their spiritual intuition more penetrating
than ours, why do they not choose as
a field for investigation the phenomena of
prenatal memory, for instance, to take one
subject at random from a multitude of
others, phenomena which, although sporadic
and open to question, are still admissible?
We are only too eager to allow ourselves to
be convinced, for all that adds anything to
man’s importance, range or duration must
needs be gladly welcomed.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />THE NEOSPIRITUALISTIC<br />HYPOTHESIS: APPARITIONS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>Outside theosophy, investigations of a
purely scientific nature have been made
in the baffling regions of survival and reincarnation.
Neospiritualism, or psychicism
or experimental spiritualism, had its origin
in America in 1870. In the following year,
the first strictly scientific experiments were
organized by Sir William Crookes, the man
of genius who opened up most of the roads
at the end of which men were astounded to
discover unknown properties and conditions
of matter; and, as early as 1873 or 1874, he
obtained, with the aid of the medium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Florence Cook, phenomena of materialization
that have hardly been surpassed. But the
real inauguration of the new science dates
from the foundation of the Society of
Psychical Research, familiarly known as the
S.P.R. This society was formed in London,
twenty-eight years ago, under the auspices
of the most distinguished men of science
in England and has, as we know, made
a methodical and strict study of every case
of supernormal psychology and sensibility.
This study or investigation, originally conducted
by Edmund Gurney, F. W. H.
Myers and Frank Podmore and continued by
their successors, is a masterpiece of scientific
patience and conscientiousness. Not an
incident is admitted that is not supported by
unimpeachable testimony, by definite written
records and convincing corroboration; in a
word, it is hardly possible to contest the
essential veracity of the majority of them,
unless we begin by making up our minds to
deny any positive value to human evidence
and by making any conviction, any certainty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>impossible that derives its source therefrom.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Among those supernormal manifestations,
telepathy, telergy, previsions and so forth,
we will take cognizance only of those which
relate to life beyond the grave. They can
be divided into two categories: (1) real,
objective and spontaneous apparitions, or
direct manifestations; (2) manifestations obtained
by the agency of mediums, whether
induced apparitions, which we will put aside
for the moment because of their frequently
questionable character,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> or communications
with the dead by word of mouth or automatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>writing. We will stop for a moment
to consider those extraordinary communications.
They have been studied at length
by such men as F. W. H. Myers, Richard
Hodgson, Sir Oliver Lodge and the philosopher
William James, the father of the new
pragmatism; they profoundly impressed
and almost convinced these men and
they therefore deserve to arrest our
attention.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>As concerns the manifestations of the first
category, it is, of course, impossible to give
even a summary account of the most striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of them in these pages; and I refer the reader
to the volumes of the <i>Proceedings</i>. It is
enough to remember that numerous apparitions
of deceased persons have been investigated
and studied by men of science like
Sir William Crookes, Alfred Russel Wallace,
Robert Dale Owen, Professor Aksakof, Paul
Gibier and others. Gurney, who is one of
the classics of this new science, gives two
hundred and thirty instances of this sort;
and, since then, the <i>Journal</i> of the S.P.R.
and the spiritualistic reviews have never
ceased to record new ones. It appears
therefore to be as well established as a fact
can be that a spiritual or nervous shape, an
image, a belated reflexion of life is capable
of subsisting for some time, of releasing
itself from the body, of surviving it, of
traversing enormous distances in the
twinkling of an eye, of manifesting itself to
the living and, sometimes, of communicating
with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the rest, we have to recognize that
these apparitions are very brief. They only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>take place at the precise moment of death
or follow very shortly after. They do not
seem to have the least consciousness of a
new or superterrestrial life differing from
that of the body whence they issue. On the
contrary, their spiritual energy, at a time
when it ought to be absolutely pure, because
it is rid of matter, seems greatly inferior to
what it was when matter surrounded it.
These more or less uneasy phantasms, often
tormented with trivial cares, have never,
although they come from another world,
brought us one single revelation of topical
interest concerning that world whose prodigious
threshold they have crossed. Soon,
they fade away and disappear for ever. Are
they the first glimmers of a new existence or
the final glimmers of the old? Do the dead
thus use, for want of a better, the last link
that binds them and makes them perceptible
to our senses? Do they afterwards go on
living around us, without again succeeding,
in spite of their endeavours, in making themselves
known or giving us an idea of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>presence, because we have not the organ
that is necessary to perceive them, even as
all our endeavours would not succeed in
giving a man who was blind from birth the
least notion of light and colour? We do
not know at all; nor can we tell whether it
be permissible to draw any conclusion from
all these incontestable phenomena. They
would really assume importance only if it
were possible to verify or to induce apparitions
of beings whose death dated back a
certain number of years. We should then
at last have the positive proof, which has
always escaped us hitherto, that the spirit is
independent of the body, that it is cause,
not effect, that it can thrive, find sustenance
and perform its functions without organs.
The greatest question that humanity has
ever set itself would thus be, if not solved, at
least rid of some of its obscurity; and, forthwith,
personal survival, while continuing to
be wrapped in the mysteries of the beginning
and the end, would become defensible. But
we have not yet reached that stage. Meanwhile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>it is interesting to observe that there
really are ghosts, spectres and phantoms.
Once again, science steps in to confirm a
general belief of mankind and to teach us
that a belief of this sort, however absurd
it may at first seem, still deserves careful
examination.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE DEAD</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c009'>The spiritualists communicate or think
that they communicate with the dead
by means of what they call automatic speech
and writing. These are obtained by the
agency of a medium<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> in a state of ecstasy or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>rather of “trance,” to employ the vocabulary
of the new science. This condition
is not one of hypnotic sleep, nor does it seem
to be an hysterical manifestation; it is often
associated, as in the case of the medium
Mrs. Piper, with perfect health and complete
intellectual and physical balance. It is
rather the more or less voluntary emergence
of a second or subliminal personality or
consciousness of the medium; or, if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>admit the spiritualistic hypothesis, his occupation,
his “psychic invasion,” as Myers
calls it, by forces from another world.
In the “entranced” subject, the normal
consciousness and personality are entirely
done away with; and he replies “automatically,”
sometimes by word of mouth,
more often in writing, to the questions put
to him. It has happened that he speaks and
writes simultaneously, his voice being occupied
by one spirit and his hand by another,
who thus carry on two independent conversations.
More rarely, the voice and the
two hands are “possessed” at one and the
same time; and we receive three different
communications. Obviously, manifestations
of this sort lend themselves to frauds and
impostures of every kind; and the distrust
aroused is at first invincible. But there are
some that make their appearance encompassed
with such guarantees of good faith
and sincerity, so often, so long and so
rigorously checked by scientific men of
unimpeachable character and authority and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of originally inflexible scepticism that it
becomes difficult to maintain a suspicion at
the finish.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Unfortunately, I am not able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to enter here into the details of some of
these purely scientific sittings, those for
instance of Mrs. Piper, the famous medium
with whom F. W. H. Myers, Richard
Hodgson, Professor Newbold, of the University
of Pennsylvania, Sir Oliver Lodge
and William James worked during a number
of years. On the other hand, it is precisely
the accumulation and coincidences of these
abnormal details which gradually produce
and confirm the conviction that we are in
the presence of an entirely new, improbable,
but genuine phenomenon, which is sometimes
difficult of classification among exclusively
terrestrial phenomena. I should have to
devote to these “communications” a special
study which would exceed the limits of this
essay; and I will therefore content myself
with referring those who care to know more
of the subject to Sir Oliver Lodge’s book,
<i>The Survival of Man</i>, recently translated
into French under the title of <i>La Survivance
humaine</i>; and, above all, to the twenty-five
bulky volumes of the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>S.P.R., notably to the report and comments
of William James on the Piper-Hodgson sittings
in Vol. XXIII. and to Vol. XIII., where
Hodgson examines the facts and arguments
that may be adduced for or against the
agency of the dead; and, lastly, to Myers’
great work, <i>Human Personality and its
Survival after Bodily Death</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>The “entranced” mediums are invaded or
possessed by different familiar spirits to
whom the new science gives the somewhat
inappropriate and ambiguous name of
“controls.” Thus, Mrs. Piper is visited in
succession by Phinuit, George Pelham, or
“G.P.,” Imperator, Doctor and Rector.
Mrs. Thompson, another very celebrated
medium, has Nelly for her usual tenant,
while graver and more illustrious personages
would take possession of Stainton Moses the
clergyman. Each of these spirits retains a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>sharply defined character, which is consistent
throughout and which, moreover, for the
most part bears no relation to that of the
medium. Amongst these, Phinuit and Nelly
are undoubtedly the most attractive, the
most original, the most living, the most
active and, above all, the most talkative.
They centralize the communications after a
fashion; they come and go officiously; and,
should any one of those present wish to
be brought into touch with the soul of a
deceased relative or friend, they fly in search
of it, find it amid the invisible throng, usher
it in, announce its presence, speak in its name,
transmit and, so to speak, translate the
questions and replies; for it seems that it is
very difficult for the dead to communicate
with the living and that they need special
aptitudes and a concurrence of extraordinary
circumstances. We will not yet examine
what they have to reveal to us; but to see
them thus fluttering to and fro amid the
multitude of their discarnate brothers and
sisters gives us a first impression of the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>world which is none too reassuring; and we
say to ourselves that the dead of to-day are
strangely like those whom Ulysses conjured
up out the Cimmerian darkness three
thousand years ago: pale and empty shades,
bewildered, incoherent, puerile and terror-stricken,
like unto dreams, more numerous
than the leaves that fall in autumn and, like
them, trembling in the unknown winds from
the vast plains of the other world. They no
longer even have enough life to be unhappy
and seem to drag out, we know not where,
a precarious and idle existence, to wander
aimlessly, to hover round us, slumbering or
chattering among one another of the minor
matters of the world; and, when a gap is
made in their darkness, to come up in haste
from all sides, like flocks of famished birds,
hungering for light and the sound of a human
voice. And, in spite of ourselves, we think
of the <i>Odyssey</i> and the sinister words of the
shade of Achilles as it issued from Erebus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not, O illustrious Ulysses, speak to
me of death; I would wish, being on earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>to serve for hire with another man of no
estate, who had not much livelihood, rather
than rule over all the departed dead.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>What have these latter-day dead to tell us?
To begin with, it is a remarkable thing that
they appear to be much more interested in
events here below than in those of the world
wherein they move. They seem, above all,
jealous to establish their identity, to prove
that they still exist, that they recognize us,
that they know everything; and, to convince
us of this, they enter into the most minute
and forgotten details with extraordinary
precision, perspicacity and prolixity. They
are also extremely clever at unravelling the
intricate family connexions of the person
actually questioning them, of any of the
sitters, or even of a stranger entering the
room. They recall this one’s little infirmities,
that one’s maladies, the eccentricities
or tendencies of a third. They have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>cognizance of events taking place at a distance:
they see, for instance, and describe to their
hearers in London an insignificant episode in
Canada. In a word, they say and do almost
all the disconcerting and inexplicable things
that are sometimes obtained from a first-rate
medium; perhaps they even go a little further;
but there comes from it all no breath,
no glimmer of the hereafter, not even the
something vaguely promised and vaguely
waited for.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall be told that the mediums are
visited only by inferior spirits, incapable of
tearing themselves from earthly cares and
soaring towards greater and loftier ideas.
It is possible; and no doubt we are wrong to
believe that a spirit stripped of its body can
suddenly be transformed and reach, in a
moment, the level of our imaginings; but
could they not at least inform us where they
are, what they feel and what they do?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And now it seems that death itself has
elected to answer these objections. Frederic
Myers, Richard Hodgson and William James,
who so often, for long and ardent hours,
questioned Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson
and obliged the departed to speak by their
mouths, are now themselves among the
shades, on the other side of the curtain of
darkness. They at least knew exactly what
to do in order to reach us, what to reveal in
order to allay men’s uneasy curiosity. Myers
in particular, the most ardent, the most
convinced, the most impatient of the veil
that parted him from the eternal realities,
formally promised those who were continuing
his work that he would make every
imaginable effort out yonder, in the unknown,
to come to their aid in a decisive
fashion. He kept his word. A month after
his death, when Sir Oliver Lodge was
questioning Mrs. Thompson in her trance,
Nelly, the medium’s familiar spirit, suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>declared that she had seen Myers, that he
was not yet fully awake, but that he hoped
to come, at nine o’clock in the evening, and
“communicate” with his old friend of the
Psychical Society.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sitting was suspended and resumed at
half past eight; and Myers’ “communication”
was at last obtained. He was
recognized by the first few words he spoke;
it was really he; he had not changed.
Faithful to his idiosyncracy when on earth,
he at once insisted on the necessity for
taking notes. But he seemed dazed. They
spoke to him of the Society for Psychical
Research, the sole interest of his life. He
had lost all recollection of it. Then memory
gradually revived; and there followed a
quantity of post-mortem gossip on the
subject of the society’s next president, the
obituary article in the <i>Times</i>, the letters
that should be published and so on. He
complained that people would not let
him rest, that there was not a place in
England where they did not ask for him:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Call Myers! Bring Myers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ought to be given time to collect himself,
to reflect. He also complained of the
difficulty of conveying his ideas through the
mediums: “they were translating like a
schoolboy does his first lines of Virgil.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> As
for his present condition, “he groped his
way as if through passages, before he knew he
was dead. He thought he had lost his way
in a strange town ... and, even when he
saw people that he knew were dead, he
thought they were only visions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This, together with more chatter of a no
less trivial nature, is about all that we obtained
from Myers’ “control” or “impersonation,”
of which better things had
been expected. The “communication” and
many others which, it appears, recall in
a striking fashion Myers’ habits, character
and ways of thinking and speaking, would
possess some value if none of those by whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>or to whom they were made had been
acquainted with him at the time when he
was still numbered among the living. As
they stand, they are most probably but reminiscences
of a secondary personality of
the medium or unconscious suggestions of
the questioner or the sitters.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>A more important communication and a
more perplexing, because of the names
connected with it, is that which is known
as “Mrs. Piper’s Hodgson-Control.” Professor
William James devotes an account of
over a hundred and twenty pages to it in Vol.
XXIII. of the <i>Proceedings</i>. Dr. Hodgson,
in his lifetime, was secretary of the American
branch of the S.P.R., of which William James
was vice-president. For many years, he
devoted himself to the medium Mrs. Piper,
working with her twice a week and thus
accumulating an enormous mass of documents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>on the subject of posthumous manifestations,
a mass whose wealth has not yet been exhausted.
Like Myers, he had promised to
come back after his death; and, in his jovial
way, he had more than once declared to Mrs.
Piper that, when he came to visit her in his
turn, as he had more experience than the
other spirits, the sittings would take a more
decisive shape and that “he would make it
hot for them.” He did come back, a week
after his death, and manifested himself by
automatic writing (which, with Mrs. Piper as
medium, was the most usual method of communication)
during several sittings at which
William James was present. I should like to
give an idea of these manifestations. But,
as the celebrated Harvard professor very
truly observes, the shorthand report of a
sitting of this kind at once alters its aspect
from start to finish. We seek in vain for the
emotion experienced on thus finding one’s
self in the presence of an invisible but living
being, who not only answers your questions,
but anticipates your thoughts, understands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>before you have finished speaking, grasps an
allusion and caps it with another allusion,
grave or smiling. The life of the dead man,
which, during a strange hour, had, so to speak,
surrounded and penetrated you, seems to be
extinguished for the second time. Stenography,
which is devoid of all emotion, no
doubt supplies the best elements for arriving
at a logical conclusion; but it is not certain
that here, as in many other cases where the
unknown predominates, logic is the only
road that leads to the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I first undertook,” says William
James, “to collate this series of sittings and
make the present report, I supposed that my
verdict would be determined by pure logic.
Certain minute incidents, I thought, ought
to make for spirit-return or against it in a
‘crucial’ way. But watching my mind
work as it goes over the data, convinces me
that exact logic plays only a preparatory
part in shaping our conclusions here; and
that the decisive vote, if there be one, has to
be cast by what I may call one’s general sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of dramatic probability, which sense ebbs
and flows from one hypothesis to another—it
does so in the present writer at least—in a
rather illogical manner. If one sticks to the
detail, one may draw an anti-spiritist conclusion;
if one thinks more of what the whole
mass may signify, one may well incline to
spiritist interpretations.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>And, at the end of his article, he sums up in
the following words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I myself feel as if an external will to
communicate were probably there</i>, that is, I
find myself doubting, in consequence of my
whole acquaintance with that sphere of
phenomena, that Mrs. Piper’s dream-life,
even equipped with ‘telepathic’ powers,
accounts for all the results found. But if
asked whether the will to communicate be
Hodgson’s, or be some mere spirit-counterfeit
of Hodgson, I remain uncertain and await
more facts, facts which may not point clearly
to a conclusion for fifty or a hundred years.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>As we see, William James is inclined to
waver; and at certain points in his account
he appears to waver still more and indeed to
say deliberately that the spirits “have a
finger in the pie.” These hesitations on the
part of a man who has revolutionized our
psychological ideas and who possessed a
brain as wonderfully organized and well-balanced
as that of our own Taine, for
instance, are very significant. As a doctor
of medicine and a professor of philosophy,
sceptical by nature and scrupulously faithful
to experimental methods, he was thrice
qualified to conduct investigations of this
kind to a successful conclusion. It is not a
question of allowing ourselves, in our turn,
to be unduly influenced by those hesitations;
but, in any case, they show that the problem
is a serious one, the gravest, perhaps, if the
facts were beyond dispute, which we have had
to solve since the coming of Christ; and that
we must not expect to dismiss it with a
shrug or a laugh.</p>

those who wish to form an opinion of their
own on the “Piper-Hodgson” case to the
text of the <i>Proceedings</i>. The case, at the
same time, is far from being one of the most
striking; it should rather be classed, were
it not for the importance of the sitters
concerned, among the minor successes of the
Piper series. Hodgson, according to the invariable
custom of the spirits, is, first of all,
bent on making himself recognized; and
the inevitable and tedious string of trifling
reminiscences begins twenty times over again
and fills page after page. As usual in such
instances, the recollections common to both
the questioner and the spirit who is supposed
to reply are brought out in their most circumstantial,
their most insignificant and also
their most private details with astonishing
eagerness, precision and vivacity. And observe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>that, for all these details, which he
discloses with such extraordinary facility, the
dead man speaking goes by preference, one
would say, to the most hidden and forgotten
treasures of the living listener’s memory. He
spares him nothing; he harps on everything
with childish satisfaction and apprehensive
solicitude, not so much to persuade others as
to prove to himself that he still exists. And
the obstinacy of this poor invisible being, in
striving to manifest himself through the
hitherto uncrannied doors that separate us
from our eternal destinies, is at once ridiculous
and tragic:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember, William, when we
were in the country at So-and-so’s, that
game we played with the children; do you
remember my saying such-and-such a thing
when I was in that room where there was
such-and-such a chair or table?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, Hodgson, I do remember
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good test, that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First-rate, Hodgson!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>And so on, indefinitely. Sometimes, there
is a more significant incident that seems to
surpass the mere transmission of subliminal
thought. They are talking, for instance, of
a frustrated marriage which was always
surrounded with great mystery, even to
Hodgson’s most intimate friends:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember a lady-doctor in New
York, a member of our society?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but what about her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her husband’s name was Blair ... I
think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean Dr. Blair Thaw?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. Ask Mrs. Thaw if I did not at
a dinner-party mention something about the
lady. I may have done so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James writes to Mrs. Thaw, who declares
that, as a matter of fact, fifteen years before,
Hodgson had said to her that he had just
proposed to a girl and been refused. Mrs.
Thaw and Dr. Newbold were the only people
in the world who knew the particulars.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to come to the further sittings.
Among other points discussed is the financial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>position of the American branch of the
S.P.R., a position which, at the death of the
secretary, or rather factotum, Hodgson, was
anything but brilliant. And behold the
somewhat strange spectacle of different
members of the society debating its affairs
with their defunct secretary. Shall they
dissolve? Shall they amalgamate? Shall
they send the materials collected, most of
which are Hodgson’s, to England? They
consult the dead man; he replies, gives good
advice, seems fully aware of all the complications,
all the difficulties. One day, in
Hodgson’s life-time, when the society was
found to be short of funds, an anonymous
donor had sent the sum necessary to relieve
it from embarrassment. Hodgson alive did
not know who the donor was; Hodgson dead
picks him out among those present, addresses
him by name and thanks him publicly. On
another occasion, Hodgson, like all the spirits,
complains of the extreme difficulty which he
finds in conveying his thought through the
alien organism of the medium:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I find now difficulties such as a blind
man would experience in trying to find his
hat,” he says.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, when, after so much idle chatter,
William James at last puts the essential
questions that burn our lips—“Hodgson,
what have you to tell us about the other
life?”—the dead man becomes shifty and
does nothing but seek evasions:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not a vague fantasy but a reality,”
he replies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” Mrs. William James insists, “do
you live as we do, as men do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does she say?” asks the spirit,
pretending not to understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you live as men do?” repeats
William James.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you wear clothing and live in
houses?” adds his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, houses, but not clothing. No,
that is absurd. Just wait a moment, I am
going to get out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will come back again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“He has got to go out and get his breath,”
remarks another spirit, named Rector, suddenly
intervening.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has not been waste of time, perhaps, to
reproduce the general features of one of these
sittings which may be regarded as typical.
I will add, in order to give an idea of the
farthest point which it is possible to attain,
the following instance of an experiment
made by Sir Oliver Lodge and related by
him. He handed Mrs. Piper, in her “trance,”
a gold watch which had just been sent him
by one of his uncles and which belonged to
that uncle’s twin brother, who had died
twenty years before. When the watch was
in her possession, Mrs. Piper, or rather
Phinuit, one of her familiar spirits, began
to relate a host of details concerning the
childhood of this twin brother, facts dating
back for more than sixty-six years and of
course unknown to Sir Oliver Lodge. Soon
after, the surviving uncle, who lived in
another town, wrote and confirmed the
accuracy of most of these details, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>had quite forgotten and of which he was
only now reminded by the medium’s
revelations; while those which he could
not recollect at all were subsequently
declared to be in accordance with fact by
a third uncle, an old sea-captain, who lived
in Cornwall and who had not the least
notion why such strange questions were put
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I quote this instance not because it has
any exceptional or decisive value, but simply,
I repeat, by way of an example; for, like the
case connected with Mrs. Thaw, mentioned
above, it marks pretty exactly the extreme
points to which people have up to now,
thanks to spirit agency, penetrated the
mysteries of the unknown. It is well
to add that cases in which the supposed
limits of the most far-reaching telepathy
are so manifestly exceeded are fairly uncommon.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now what are we to think of all this?
Must we, with Myers, Newbold, Hyslop,
Hodgson and so many others, who studied
this problem at length, conclude in favour
of the incontestable agency of forces and
intelligences returning from the farther
bank of the great river which it was deemed
that none might cross? Must we acknowledge
with them that there are cases
ever more numerous which make it impossible
for us to hesitate any longer between
the telepathic hypothesis and the spiritualistic
hypothesis? I do not think so. I have no
prejudices—what were the use of having
any, in these mysteries?—no reluctance to
admit the survival and the intervention of
the dead; but it is wise and necessary,
before leaving the terrestrial plane, to
exhaust all the suppositions, all the explanations
there to be discovered. We have
to make our choice between two manifestations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the unknown, two miracles, if
you prefer, whereof one is situated in the
world which we inhabit and the other in a
region which, rightly or wrongly, we believe
to be separated from us by nameless spaces
which no human being, alive or dead, has
crossed to this day. It is natural, therefore,
that we should stay in our own world, as
long as it gives us a foothold, as long as we
are not pitilessly expelled from it by a series
of irresistible and irrefutable facts issuing
from the adjoining abyss. The survival of a
spirit is no more improbable than the prodigious
faculties which we are obliged to
attribute to the mediums if we deny them
to the dead; but the existence of the medium,
contrary to that of the spirit, is unquestionable;
and therefore it is for the spirit, or
for those who make use of its name, first to
prove that it exists.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do the extraordinary phenomena of which
we have spoken—transmission of thought
from one subconscious mind to another,
perception of events at a distance, subliminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>clairvoyance—occur when the dead are not
in evidence, when the experiments are being
made exclusively between living persons?
This cannot be honestly contested. Certainly
no one has ever obtained among living
people series of communications or revelations
similar to those of the great spiritualistic
mediums, Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Thompson
and Stainton Moses, nor anything that can
be compared with these so far as continuity
or lucidity is concerned. But, though
the quality of the phenomena will not bear
comparison, it cannot be denied that their
inner nature is identical. It is logical to
infer from this that the real cause lies not in
the source of inspiration, but in the personal
value, the sensitiveness, the power of the
medium. For the rest, Mr. J. G. Piddington,
who devoted an exceedingly detailed study
to Mrs. Thompson, plainly perceived in her,
when she was not “entranced” and when
there were no spirits whatever in question,
manifestations inferior, it is true, but absolutely
analogous to those involving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>dead.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> These mediums are pleased, in all
good faith and probably unconsciously, to
give to their subliminal faculties, to their
secondary personalities, or to accept, on
their behalf, names which were borne by
beings who have crossed to the farther side
of the mystery: this is a matter of vocabulary
or nomenclature which neither lessens nor
increases the intrinsic significance of the
facts. Well, in examining these facts, however
strange and really unparalleled some of
them may be, I never find one which proceeds
frankly from this world or which comes
indisputably from the other. They are, if
you wish, phenomenal border incidents; but
it cannot be said that the border has been
violated. In the story of Sir Oliver Lodge’s
watch, for instance, which is one of the most
characteristic and one which carries us</p>
<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>farther than most, we must attribute to
the medium faculties that have ceased to
be human. She must have put herself in
touch, whether by perception of events at a
distance, or by transmission of thought from
one subconscious mind to another, or again
by subliminal clairvoyance, with the two
surviving brothers of the deceased owner of
the watch; and, in the past subconsciousness
of those two brothers, distant from each
other, she had to rediscover a host of circumstances
which they themselves had forgotten
and which lay hidden beneath the
heaped-up dust and darkness of six-and-sixty
years. It is certain that a phenomenon
of this kind passes the bounds of the imagination
and that we should refuse to credit it
if, first of all, the experiment had not been
controlled and certified by a man of the
standing of Sir Oliver Lodge and if, moreover,
it did not form one of a group of
equally significant facts which clearly show
that we are not here concerned with an
absolutely unique miracle or with an unhoped-for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and unprecedented concourse of
coincidences. It is simply a matter of distant
perception, subliminal clairvoyance and telepathy
raised to the highest power; and
these three manifestations of the unexplored
depths of man are to-day recognized and
classified by science, which is not saying that
they are explained: that is another question.
When, in connexion with electricity, we
use such terms as positive, negative, induction,
potential and resistance, we are also applying
conventional words to facts and phenomena
of whose inward essence we are utterly
ignorant; and we must needs be content
with these, pending better. There is, I
insist, between these extraordinary manifestations
and those given to us by a medium
who is not speaking in the name of the dead,
but a difference of the greater and the lesser,
a difference of extent or degree and in no
wise a difference in kind.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
<h3 class='c007'>8</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For the proof to be more decisive, it
would be necessary that no one, neither the
medium nor the witnesses, should ever have
known of the existence of him whose past is
revealed by the dead man, in other words,
that every living link should be eliminated.
I do not believe that this has actually occurred
up to the present, nor even that it is possible;
in any case, it would be very difficult to
control such an experiment. Be this as it
may, Dr. Hodgson, who devoted part of his
life to the quest of specific phenomena
wherein the boundaries of mediumistic power
should be plainly overstepped, believes that
he found them in certain cases, of which—as
the others were of very much the same
nature—I will merely mention one of the
most striking.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> In a course of excellent
sittings with Mrs. Piper the medium, he
communicated with various dead friends</p>
<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>who reminded him of a large number
of common memories. The medium, the
spirits and he himself seemed in a wonderfully
accommodating mood; and the revelations
were plentiful, exact and easy. In
this extremely favourable atmosphere, he
was placed in communication with the soul
of one of his best friends, who had died a
year before and whom he simply calls “A.”
This A, whom he had known more intimately
than most of the spirits with whom
he had communicated previously, behaved
quite differently and, while establishing his
identity beyond dispute, vouchsafed only
incoherent replies. Now A “had been
troubled much, for years before his death,
by headaches and occasionally mental exhaustion,
though not amounting to positive
mental disturbance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The same phenomenon appears to recur
whenever similar troubles have come before
death, as in cases of suicide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the telepathic explanation is held to
be the only one,” says Dr. Hodgson (I give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the gist of his observations), “if it is claimed
that all the communications of these discarnate
minds are only suggestions from my
subconscious self, it is unintelligible that,
after having obtained satisfactory results
from others whom I had known far less
intimately than A and with whom I had
consequently far fewer recollections in
common, I should get from him, in the same
sittings, nothing but incoherencies. I am
thus driven to believe that my subliminal
self is not the only thing in evidence, that it
is in the presence of a real, living personality,
whose mental state is the same as it was at
the hour of death, a personality which remains
independent of my subliminal consciousness
and absolutely unaffected by it, which is
deaf to its suggestions and draws from its
own resources the revelations which it
makes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The argument is not without value, but
its full force would be obtained only if it
were certain that none of those present knew
of A’s madness; otherwise it can be contended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>that, the notion of madness having
penetrated the subconscious intelligence of
one of them, it worked upon it and gave to
the replies induced a form in keeping with
the state of mind presupposed in the dead
man.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>9</h3>

<p class='c008'>Of a truth, by extending the possibilities
of the medium to these extremes, we furnish
ourselves with explanations which forestall
nearly everything, bar every road and all
but deny to the spirits any power of manifesting
themselves in the manner which they
appear to have chosen. But why do they
choose that manner? Why do they thus
restrict themselves? Why do they jealously
hug the narrow strip of territory which
memory occupies on the confines of both
worlds and from which none but indecisive
or questionable evidence can reach us?
Are there then no other outlets, no other
horizons? Why do they tarry around us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>stagnant in their little pasts, when, in their
freedom from the flesh, they ought to be
able to wander at ease over the virgin
stretches of space and time? Do they not
yet know that the sign which will prove to us
that they survive is to be found not with us,
but with them, on the other side of the
grave? Why do they come back with
empty hands and empty words? Is that
what one finds when one is steeped in
infinity? Beyond our last hour is it all
bare and shapeless and dim? If it be so,
let them tell us; and the evidence of the
darkness will at least possess a grandeur that
is all too absent from these cross-examining
methods. Of what use is it to die, if all life’s
trivialities continue? Is it really worth
while to have passed through the terrifying
gorges which open on the eternal fields, in
order to remember that we had a great-uncle
called Peter and that our Cousin Paul
was afflicted with varicose veins and a gastric
complaint? At that rate, I should choose
for those whom I love the august and frozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>solitudes of the everlasting nothing. Though
it be difficult for them, as they complain,
to make themselves understood through a
strange and sleep-bound organism, they tell
us enough categorical details about the past
to show that they could disclose similar
details, if not about the future, which they
perhaps do not yet know, at least about the
lesser mysteries which surround us on every
side and which our body alone prevents us
from approaching. There are a thousand
things, large or small, alike unknown to us,
which we must perceive when feeble eyes
no longer arrest our vision. It is in those
regions from which a shadow separates us
and not in foolish tittle-tattle of the past
that they would at last find the clear and
genuine proof which they seem to seek with
such enthusiasm. Without demanding a
great miracle, one would nevertheless think
that we had the right to expect from a
mind which nothing now enthrals some other
discourse than that which it avoided when
it was still subject to matter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />CROSS CORRESPONDENCE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>This is where things stood when, of late
years, the mediums, the spiritualists, or,
rather, it appears, the spirits themselves—for
one cannot tell exactly with whom we
have to do—perhaps dissatisfied at not being
more definitely recognized and understood,
invented, for a more effectual proof of their
existence, what has been called “cross
correspondence.” Here, the position is
reversed: it is no longer a question of
various and more or less numerous spirits
revealing themselves through the agency of
one and the same medium, but of a single
spirit manifesting itself almost simultaneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>through several mediums often at great
distances from one another and without
any preliminary understanding among themselves.
Each of these messages, taken alone,
is usually unintelligible and yields a meaning
only when laboriously combined with all the
others.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Sir Oliver Lodge says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The object of this ingenious and complicated
effort clearly is to prove that there
is some definite intelligence underlying the
phenomena, distinct from that of any of
the automatists, by sending fragments of a
message or literary reference which shall be
unintelligible to each separately—so that no
effective mutual telepathy is possible between
them—thus eliminating or trying to eliminate
what had long been recognized by all
members of the Society for Psychical
Research as the most troublesome and indestructible
of the semi-normal hypotheses.
And the further object is evidently to prove
as far as possible, by the substance and
quality of the message, that it is characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of the one particular personality
who is ostensibly communicating, and of no
other.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The experiments are still in their early
stages; and the most recent volumes of the
<i>Proceedings</i> are devoted to them. Although
the accumulated mass of evidence is already
considerable, there is no conclusion to be
drawn from it as yet; and, in any case, whatever
the spiritualists may say, the suspicion
of telepathy seems to me to be in no way
removed. The experiments form a rather
fantastic literary exercise, one much superior,
intellectually, to the ordinary manifestations
of the mediums; but, up to the present,
there is no reason for placing their mystery
in the other world rather than in this. Men
have tried to see in them a proof that somewhere,
in time or space, or else beyond both,
there is a sort of immense cosmic reserve of
knowledge upon which the spirits go and
draw freely. But, if the reserve exist,
which is very possible, nothing tells us that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>it is not the living rather than the dead who
repair to it. It is very strange that the
dead, if they really have access to the
immeasurable treasure, should bring back
nothing from it but a kind of ingenious
child’s puzzle, although it ought to contain
myriads of lost or forgotten notions and
acquirements, heaped up during thousands
and thousands of years in abysses which our
mind, weighed down by the body, can no
longer penetrate, but which nothing seems
to close against the investigations of freer
and more subtle activities. They are evidently
surrounded by innumerable mysteries,
by unsuspected and formidable truths that
loom large on every side. The smallest
astronomical or biological revelation, the
least secret of olden time, such as that of the
temper of copper, possessed by the ancients,
an archæological detail, a poem, a statue, a
recovered remedy, a shred of one of those
unknown sciences which flourished in Egypt
or Atlantis: any of these would form a much
more decisive argument than hundreds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>more or less literary reminiscences. Why do
they speak to us so seldom of the future?
And for what reason, when they do venture
upon it, are they mistaken with such disheartening
regularity? One would think,
rather, that, in the sight of a being delivered
from the trammels of the body and
of time, the years, whether past or future,
ought all to lie outspread on one and
the same plane.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> We may, therefore, say
that the ingenuity of the proof turns
against it.</p>

<p class='c009'>All things considered, as in the other
attempts and notably those of the famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>medium Stainton Moses, there is the same
characteristic inability to bring us the veriest
particle of truth or knowledge of which no
vestige could be found in a living brain or in a
book written on this earth. And yet it is inconceivable
that there should not somewhere
exist a knowledge that is not as ours and
truths other than those which we possess
here below.</p>

<p class='c009'>The case of Stainton Moses, whose name
we have just mentioned, is a very striking
one in this respect. This Stainton Moses
was a dogmatic, hard-working clergyman,
whose learning, Myers tells us, in the
normal state, did not exceed that of an
ordinary schoolmaster. But he was no
sooner “entranced” before certain spirits
of antiquity or of the middle ages, who
are hardly known save to profound scholars,
among others St. Hippolytus, Bishop of
Ostia, Plotinus, Athenodorus, the tutor of
Augustus, and, more particularly, Grocyn,
the friend of Erasmus, took possession of his
person and manifested themselves through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>his agency. Now Grocyn, for instance,
furnished certain information about Erasmus
which was at first thought to have been
gathered in the other world, but which was
subsequently discovered in forgotten, but
nevertheless accessible books. On the other
hand, Stainton Moses’ integrity was never
questioned for an instant by those who
knew him; and we may therefore take his
word for it when he declares that he had not
read the books in question. Here again, the
mystery, inexplicable though it be, seems
really to lie hidden in the midst of ourselves.
It is unconscious reminiscence, if you will,
suggestion at a distance, subliminal reading,
but, no more than in cross correspondence,
is it indispensable to have recourse to the dead
and to drag them by main force into the
riddle, which, seen from our side of the
grave, is dark and impassioned enough as it is.
Furthermore, we must not insist unduly
on this cross correspondence. We must
remember that the whole thing is in its
earliest stages and that the dead appear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>have no small difficulty in grasping the
requirements of the living.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>In regard to this subject, as to the others,
the spiritualists are fond of saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you refuse to admit the agency of
spirits, the majority of these phenomena are
absolutely inexplicable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Agreed; nor do we pretend to explain
them, for hardly anything is to be explained
upon this earth. We are content simply to
ascribe them to the incomprehensible power
of the mediums, which is no more improbable
than the survival of the dead and
has the advantage of not going outside the
sphere which we occupy and of bearing
relation to a large number of similar facts that
occur among living people. Those singular
faculties are baffling only because they are
still sporadic and because but a very short
time has elapsed since they received scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>recognition. Properly speaking, they are no
more marvellous than those which we use
daily without marvelling at them: our
memory, for instance, our understanding,
our imagination and so forth. They form
part of the great miracle that we are; and,
having once admitted the miracle, we should
be surprised not so much at its extent as at
its limits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, to close this chapter, I am
not at all of opinion that we must definitely
reject the spiritualistic theory: that would
be both unjust and premature. Hitherto,
everything remains in suspense. We may
say that things are still very little removed
from the point marked by Sir William
Crookes, in 1874, in an article which he
contributed to the <i>Quarterly Journal of
Science</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The difference between the advocates of
Psychic Force and the Spiritualists consists in
this—that we contend that there is as yet
insufficient proof of any other directing agent
than the Intelligence of the Medium, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>no proof whatever of the agency of Spirits
of the Dead; while the Spiritualists hold
it as a faith, not demanding further proof,
that Spirits of the Dead are the sole agents
in the production of all the phenomena.
Thus the controversy resolves itself into a
pure question of <i>fact</i>, only to be determined
by a laborious and long-continued series of
experiments and an extensive collection of
psychological <i>facts</i>, which should be the
first duty of the Psychological Society, the
formation of which is now in progress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, it is saying a good deal that
rigorous scientific investigations have not
utterly shattered a theory which so radically
confounds the idea which we were wont to
form of death. We shall see presently why,
in considering our destinies beyond the
grave, we need have no reason to linger too
long over these apparitions or these revelations,
even though they should really be
incontestable and to the point. They would
seem, all told, to be but the incoherent and
precarious manifestations of a transitory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>state. They would at best prove, if we were
bound to admit them, that a reflexion of
ourselves, an after-vibration of the nerves,
a bundle of emotions, a spiritual silhouette,
a grotesque and forlorn image, or, more
correctly, a sort of truncated and uprooted
memory can, after our death, linger and float
in a space where nothing remains to feed it,
where it gradually becomes wan and lifeless,
but where a special fluid, emanating from
an exceptional medium, succeeds, at moments,
in galvanizing it. Perhaps it exists objectively,
perhaps it subsists and revives only in the
recollection of certain sympathies. It would,
after all, be not unlikely that the memory
which represents us during our life should
continue to do so for a few weeks or even a
few years after our decease. This would
explain the evasive and deceptive character
of those spirits which, possessing but a
mnemonic existence, are naturally able to
interest themselves only in matters within
their reach. Hence their irritating and
maniacal energy in clinging to the slightest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>facts, their sleepy dulness, their incomprehensible
indifference and ignorance and all
the wretched absurdities which we have
noticed more than once.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, I repeat, it is much simpler to attribute
these absurdities to the special character
and the as yet imperfectly-recognized difficulties
of telepathic communication. The
unconscious suggestions of the most intelligent
among those who take part in the experiment
are impaired, disjointed and stripped
of their main virtues in passing through the
obscure intermediary of the medium. It
may be that they stray, make their way
into certain forgotten corners which the
intelligence no longer visits and thence bring
back more or less surprising discoveries;
but the intellectual quality of the aggregate
will always be inferior to that which a
conscious mind would yield. Besides, once
more, it is not yet time to draw conclusions.
We must not lose sight of the fact that we
have to do with a science which was born
but yesterday and which is groping for its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>implements, its paths, its methods and its aim
in a darkness denser than the earth’s. The
boldest bridge that men have yet undertaken
to throw across the river of death is not to
be built in thirty years. Most sciences have
centuries of thankless efforts and barren uncertainties
behind them; and there are,
I imagine, few among the younger of them
that can show from the earliest hour, as this
one does, promises of a harvest which may
not be the harvest of their conscious sowing,
but which already bids fair to yield much
unknown and wondrous fruit.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />REINCARNATION</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>So much for survival proper. But certain
spiritualists go farther and attempt
the scientific proof of palingenesis and the
transmigration of souls. I pass over their
merely moral or scientific arguments, as well
as those which they discover in the prenatal
reminiscences of illustrious men and others.
These reminiscences, though often disturbing,
are still too rare, too sporadic, so to speak;
and the supervision has not always been sufficiently
close for us to be able to rely upon
them with safety. Nor do I propose to
pay attention to the proofs based upon the
inborn aptitudes of genius or of certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>infant prodigies, aptitudes which are difficult
to explain, but which may nevertheless be
attributed to unknown laws of heredity.
I shall be content to recall briefly the results
of some of Colonel de Rochas’ experiments,
which leave one at a loss for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>First of all, it is only right to say that
Colonel de Rochas is a savant who seeks
nothing but objective truth and does so
with a scientific strictness and integrity that
have never been questioned. He puts certain
exceptional subjects into an hypnotic sleep
and, by means of downward passes, makes
them trace back the whole course of their
existence. He thus takes them successively
to their youth, their adolescence and down
to the extreme limits of their childhood. At
each of these hypnotic stages, the subject
reassumes the consciousness, the character
and the state of mind which he possessed at
the corresponding stage in his life. He goes
over the same events, with their joys and
sorrows. If he has been ill, he once more
passes through his illness, his convalescence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and his recovery. If, for instance, the subject
is a woman who has been a mother, she
again becomes pregnant and again suffers
the pains of child-birth. Carried back to an
age when she was learning to write, she writes
like a child and her writing can be placed
side by side with the copy-books which she
filled at school.</p>

<p class='c009'>This in itself is very extraordinary; but,
as Colonel de Rochas says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Up to the present, we have walked on
firm ground; we have been observing a physiological
phenomenon which is difficult of explanation,
but which numerous experiments and
verifications allow us to look upon as certain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We now enter a region where still more
surprising enigmas await us. Let us, to
come to details, take one of the simplest
cases. The subject is a girl of eighteen,
called Joséphine. She lives at Voiron, in
the department of the Isère. By means of
downward passes, she is brought back to the
condition of a baby at its mother’s breast.
The passes continue and the wonder-tale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>runs its course. Joséphine can no longer
speak; and we have the great silence of
infancy, which seems to be followed by a
silence more mysterious still. Joséphine no
longer answers except by signs; <i>she is not
yet born</i>, “she is floating in darkness.”
They persist; the sleep becomes heavier;
and suddenly, from the depths of that sleep,
rises the voice of another being, a voice
unexpected and unknown, the voice of a
churlish, distrustful and discontented old
man. They question him. At first, he
refuses to answer, saying that “of course he’s
there, as he’s speaking;” that “he sees
nothing;” and that “he’s in the dark.”
They increase the number of passes and
gradually gain his confidence. His name is
Jean Claude Bourdon; he is an old man; he
has long been ailing and bed-ridden. He
tells the story of his life. He was born at
Champvent, in the parish of Polliat, in 1812.
He went to school until he was eighteen and
served his time in the army with the 7th
Artillery at Besançon; and he describes his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>gay times there, while the sleeping girl
makes the gesture of twirling an imaginary
moustache. When he goes back to his
native place, he does not marry, but he has a
mistress. He leads a solitary life (I omit all
but the essential facts) and dies at the age of
seventy, after a long illness.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now hear the dead man speak; and
his posthumous revelations are not sensational,
which, however, is not an adequate
reason for doubting their genuineness. He
“feels himself growing out of his body;”
but he remains attached to it for a fairly long
time. His fluidic body, which is at first
diffused, takes a more concentrated form.
He lives in darkness, which he finds disagreeable;
but he does not suffer. At
last, the night in which he is plunged is
streaked with a few flashes of light. The
idea comes to him to reincarnate himself and
he draws near to her who is to be his mother
(that is to say, the mother of Joséphine). He
encircles her until the child is born, whereupon
he gradually enters the child’s body.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Until about the seventh year, this body was
surrounded by a sort of floating mist in which
he used to see many things which he has not
seen since.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next thing to be done is to go back
beyond Jean Claude. A mesmerization
lasting nearly three quarters of an hour,
without lingering at any intermediate stage,
brings the old man back to babyhood. A
fresh silence, a new limbo; and then, suddenly,
another voice and an unexpected
individual. This time, it is an old woman
who has been very wicked; and so she is
in great torment (she is dead, at the actual
instant; for, in this inverted world, lives
go backwards and of course begin at the
end). She is in deep darkness, surrounded by
evil spirits. She speaks in a faint voice, but
always gives definite replies to the questions
put to her, instead of cavilling at every
moment, as Jean Claude did. Her name is
Philomène Carteron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By intensifying the sleep,” adds Colonel
de Rochas, whom I will now quote, “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>induce the manifestations of a living Philomène.
She no longer suffers, seems very
calm and always answers very coldly and
distinctly. She knows that she is unpopular
in the neighbourhood, but no one is a penny
the worse and she will be even with them
yet. She was born in 1702; her maiden
name was Philomène Charpigny; her grandfather
on the mother’s side was called Pierre
Machon and lived at Ozan. In 1732, she
married, at Chevroux, a man named Carteron,
by whom she had two children, both of
whom she lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before her incarnation, Philomène had
been a little girl, who died in infancy.
Previous to that, she was a man who had
committed murder; and it was to expiate
this crime that she endured much suffering
in the darkness, even after her life as a little
girl, when she had had no time to do wrong.
I did not think it necessary to carry the
hypnosis further, because the subject appeared
exhausted and her paroxysms were
painful to watch.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“But, on the other hand, I noticed one
thing which would tend to show that the
revelations of these mediums rest on an
objective reality. At Voiron, one of the
regular attendants at my demonstrations is
a young girl, Louise ——. She possesses a
very sedate and thoughtful cast of mind, not
at all open to hypnotic suggestion; and she
has in a very high degree the capacity
(which is comparatively common in a lesser
degree) of perceiving the magnetic effluvia
of human beings and, consequently, the
fluidic body. When Joséphine revives the
memory of her past, a luminous aura is
observed around her and is perceived by
Louise. Now, to the eyes of Louise, this
aura becomes dark when Joséphine is in the
phase separating two existences. In every
instance, there is a strong reaction in
Joséphine when I touch points where Louise
tells me that she perceives the aura, whether
it be dark or light.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I thought it well to give the report of
one of these experiments almost <i>in extenso</i>,
because those who maintain the palingenesic
theory find in these the only appreciable
argument which they possess. Colonel de
Rochas renewed them more than once with
different subjects. Among these, I will
mention only one, a girl called Marie Mayo,
whose history is more complicated than
Joséphine’s and whose successive reincarnations
take us back to the seventeenth century
and carry us suddenly to Versailles,
among the historical personages moving
around Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us add that Colonel de Rochas is not
the only mesmerizer who has obtained
revelations of this kind, which may be
henceforth classed among the incontestable
facts of hypnotism. I have mentioned his
alone, because they offer the most substantial
guarantees from every point of view.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>What do they prove? We must begin, as
in all questions of this kind, by entertaining
a certain distrust of the medium. It goes
without saying that all mediums, by the
very nature of their faculties, are inclined to
imposture, to trickery. I know that Colonel
de Rochas, like Dr. Richet and like Professor
Lombroso, was occasionally hoaxed. That is
the inherent defect of the machinery which
we must perforce employ; and experiments
of this sort will never possess the scientific
value of those made in a physical or chemical
laboratory. But this is not an <i>a priori</i>
reason for denying them any sort of interest.
As a question of fact, are imposture and
trickery possible here? Obviously, even
though the experiments be conducted under
the strictest supervision. However complicated
it may be, the subject can have learnt
his lesson and can cleverly avoid the traps
laid for him. The best guarantee, when all
is said, lies in his good faith and his moral
sense, which the experimenters alone are in
a position to test and to know; and for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>we must trust to them. Besides, they
neglect no precaution necessary to make
imposture extremely difficult. After taking
the subject, by means of transverse passes,
up the stream of his life, they make him come
down the same stream; and the same events
pass in the reverse order. Repeated tests and
counter-tests always yield identical results;
and the medium never hesitates or goes
astray in the labyrinth of names, dates and
incidents.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Moreover, it would be requisite for these
mediums, who are generally people of merely
average intelligence, suddenly to become
great poets in order thus to create, down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>every detail, a series of characters, differing
entirely one from the other, in which everything
is in keeping—gestures, voice, temper,
mind, thoughts, feeling—and ever ready
to reply, in harmony with their inmost
nature, to the most unexpected questions.
It has been said that every man is a
Shakspeare in his dreams; but have we
not here to do with dreams which, in their
uniformity, bear a singular resemblance to
fact?</p>

<p class='c009'>I think, therefore, that we may be allowed,
until we receive evidence to the contrary,
to leave fraud out of the question. Another
objection that might be raised, as was done
with respect to the Myers phantoms, is the
insignificance of their revelations from beyond
the grave. I would rather look on this as
an argument in behalf of their good faith.
Those whose imagination is rich enough to
create the wonderful persons whom we see
living in their sleep would doubtless find no
great difficulty in inventing a few fantastic
but plausible details on the subject of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>next world. Not one of them thinks of it.
They are Christians and therefore carry
deep down in themselves the traditional
terror of hell, the fear of purgatory and the
vision of a paradise full of angels and palms.
They never allude to any of it. Although
they are most often ignorant of all the theories
of reincarnation, they conform strictly to
the theosophical or neospiritualistic hypothesis
and are unconsciously faithful to it in
their very indefiniteness: they speak vaguely
of “the dark” in which they find themselves.
They tell nothing, because they know
nothing. It is impossible apparently for
them to give any account of a state that is
still illumined. In fact, it is very likely, if
we admit the hypothesis of reincarnation
and of evolution after death, that nature,
here as elsewhere, does not proceed by bounds.
There is no special reason why she should
take a prodigious and inconceivable leap between
life and death.</p>

<p class='c009'>We did not find the dramatic change
which, at first thought, we are rather inclined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>to expect. The spirit is first of all confused
at losing its body and every one of its familiar
ways; it only recovers itself by degrees. It
resumes consciousness slowly. This consciousness
is subsequently purified, exalted
and extended, gradually and indefinitely,
until, reaching other spheres, the principle
of life that animates it ceases to reincarnate
itself and loses all contact with
us. This would explain why we never
have any but minor and elementary
revelations.</p>

<p class='c009'>All that concerns this first phase of the
survival is fairly probable, even to those who
do not admit the theory of reincarnation.
For the rest, we shall see presently that the
solutions which man’s imagination finds there
merely change the question and are inadequate
and provisional.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We now come to the most serious objection,
that of suggestion. Colonel de
Rochas declares that he and all the other
experimenters who have given themselves
up to this study “have not only avoided
everything that could put the subject on a
definite tack, but have often tried in vain
to lead him astray by different suggestions.”
I am convinced of it: there can be no
question of voluntary suggestion. But do
we not know that, in these regions, unconscious
and involuntary suggestion is often
more powerful and effective than the other?
In the hackneyed and rather childish experiment
of table-turning, for instance,
which, after all, is only a crude and elementary
form of telepathy, the replies are
nearly always dictated by the unconscious
suggestion of a participant or a mere on-looker.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
We should therefore first of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>have to make sure that neither the hypnotizer
nor the onlookers, nor yet the subject himself,
have ever heard of the reincarnated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>persons. It will be enough, I shall be told,
to employ for the counter-tests another
operator and different onlookers who are
ignorant of the previous revelations. Yes,
but the subject is not ignorant of them;
and it is possible that the first suggestion has
been so profound that it will remain for
ever stamped upon the unconsciousness and
that it will reproduce the same incarnations
indefinitely, in the same order.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this does not mean that the phenomena
of suggestion are not themselves laden with
mysteries; but that is another question.
For the moment, as we see, the problem is
almost insoluble and control impracticable.
Meanwhile, since we have to choose between
reincarnation and suggestion, it is right
that we should confine ourselves, in the first
instance, to the latter, in accordance with
the principles which we have observed in the
case of automatic speech and writing. Between
two unknowns, common sense and
prudence decree that we should turn first to
the one on whose frontiers lie certain facts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>more frequently recorded, the one which
shows a few familiar glimmers. Let us
exhaust the mystery of our life before
forsaking it for the mystery of our death.
Throughout this vast expanse of treacherous
ground, it is important that, until fresh
evidence arrives, we should keep to one
inflexible rule, namely, that thought-transference
exists as long as it is not absolutely
and physically impossible for the subject or
some person in the room to have cognizance
of the incident in question, whether the
cognizance be conscious or not, forgotten or
actual. Even this guarantee is not sufficient,
for it is still possible, as we saw in the case
of Sir Oliver Lodge’s watch, for some one
taking no part in the sitting and even very
far away from it to be placed in communication
with the medium by some unknown
means and to influence the medium at a
distance and unwittingly. Lastly, to provide
for every contingency, before letting
death come upon the boards, it would be
necessary to make certain that atavistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>memory does not play an unforeseen part.
Cannot a man, for instance, carry hidden in
the depths of his being the recollection of
events connected with the childhood of an
ancestor whom he has never seen and communicate
it to the medium by unconscious
suggestion? It is not impossible. We
carry in ourselves all the past, all the experience
of our ancestors. If, by some magic,
we could illumine the prodigious treasures of
the subconscious memory, why should we
not there discover the events and facts that
form the sources of that experience? Before
turning towards yonder unknown, we must
utterly exhaust the possibilities of this
terrestrial unknown. It is moreover remarkable
but undeniable that, despite the
strictness of a law which seems to shut out
every other explanation, despite the almost
unlimited and probably excessive scope
allotted to the domain of suggestion, there
nevertheless remain some facts which perhaps
call for another interpretation.</p>

<p class='c009'>But let us return to reincarnation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>recognize, in passing, that it is very regrettable
that the arguments of the theosophists
and neospiritualists are not compelling, for
there never was a more beautiful, a juster,
a purer, a more moral, fruitful and consoling,
nor, to a certain point, a more probable
creed than theirs. It alone, with its doctrine
of successive expiations and purifications,
accounts for all the physical and intellectual
inequalities, all the social iniquities, all the
hideous injustices of fate. But the quality
of a creed is no evidence of its truth. Even
though it is the religion of six hundred
millions of mankind, the nearest to the
mysterious origins, the only one that is not
odious and the least absurd of all, it will have
to do what the others have not done, to
bring unimpeachable testimony; and what
it has given us hitherto is but the first shadow
of a proof begun.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And even that would not put an end to the
riddle. In principle, reincarnation, sooner
or later, is inevitable, since nothing can
be lost nor remain stationary. What has
not been demonstrated in any way and
will perhaps remain indemonstrable is the
reincarnation of the whole identical individual,
notwithstanding the abolition of
memory. But what matters to him that
reincarnation, if he be unaware that he is still
himself? All the problems of the conscious
survival of man start up anew; and we have
to begin all over again. Even if scientifically
established, the doctrine of reincarnation,
just like that of a survival, would not set
a term to our questions. It replies to
neither the first nor the last, those of the
beginning and the end, the only ones that
are essential. It simply shifts them, pushes
them a few hundreds, a few thousands of
years back, in the hope perhaps of losing or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>forgetting them in silence and space. But
they have come from the depths of the
most prodigious infinities and are not
content with a tardy solution. I am
most certainly interested in learning what
is in store for me, what will happen to
me immediately after my death. You tell
me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Man, in his successive incarnations, will
make atonement by suffering, will be purified,
in order that he may ascend from sphere to
sphere until he returns to the divine essence
whence he sprang.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I am willing to believe it, notwithstanding
that all this still bears the somewhat questionable
stamp of our little earth and its
old religions; I am willing to believe it, but
even then? What matters to me is not
what will be for some time, but what will be
for always; and your divine principle appears
to me not at all infinite nor definite. It even
seems to me greatly inferior to that which
I conceive without your help. Now, if it
were based on thousands of facts, a religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>that belittles the God conceived by my
loftiest thought could never dominate
my conscience. Your infinity or your
God, while even more unintelligible than
mine, is nevertheless smaller. If I be
again immerged in Him, it means that
I emerged from Him; if it be possible
for me to have emerged from Him, then
He is not infinite; and, if He be not
infinite, what is He? We must accept one
thing or the other: either He purifies me
because I am outside Him and He is not
infinite; or, being infinite, if He purify me,
then there was something impure in Him,
because it is a part of Himself which He is
purifying in me. Moreover, how can we
admit that this God who has existed for all
time, who has the same infinity of millenaries
behind Him as in front of Him, should not
yet have found time to purify Himself and
put a period to His trials? What He was
not able to do in the eternity previous to the
moment of my existence He will not be able
to do in the subsequent eternity, for the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>are equal. And the same question presents
itself where I am concerned. My principle
of life, like His, exists from all eternity,
for my emergence out of nothing would be
more difficult of explanation than my existence
without a beginning. I have necessarily
had innumerable opportunities of incarnating
myself; and I have probably done so, seeing
that it is hardly likely that the idea only
came to me yesterday. All the chances of
reaching my goal have therefore been offered
to me in the past; and all those which I shall
find in the future will add nothing to the
number, which was already infinite. There
is not much to say in answer to these interrogations
which spring up everywhence
the moment our thought glances upon them.
Meanwhile, I had rather know that I know
nothing than feed myself on illusory and
irreconcilable assertions. I had rather keep
to an infinity whose incomprehensibility has
no bounds than restrict myself to a God
whose incomprehensibility is limited on
every side. Nothing compels you to speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>your God; but, if you take upon yourself to
do so, it is necessary that your explanations
should be superior to the silence which they
break.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is true that the scientific spiritualists do
not venture as far as this God; but then,
tight-pressed between the two riddles of the
beginning and the end, they have almost
nothing to tell us. They follow the tracks
of our dead for a few seconds, in a world
where seconds no longer count; and then
they abandon them in the darkness. I do
not reproach them, because we have here to
do with things which, in all probability, we
shall not know in the day when we shall
think that we know everything. I do not
ask that they shall reveal to me the secret of
the universe, for I do not believe, like a
child, that this secret can be expressed in
three words or that it can enter my brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>without bursting it. I am even persuaded
that beings who might be millions of times
more intelligent than the most intelligent
among us would not yet possess it, for this
secret must be as infinite, as unfathomable,
as inexhaustible as the universe itself. The
fact none the less remains that this inability
to go even a few years beyond the life after
death detracts greatly from the interest of
their experiments and revelations; at best,
it is but a short space gained; and it is not
by this juggling on the threshold that our
fate is decided. I am ready to pass over
what may befall me in the short interval
filled by those revelations, as I am even now
passing over what befalls me in my life.
My destiny does not lie there, nor my
home. I do not doubt that the facts reported
are genuine and proved; but what
is even much more certain is that the dead,
if they survive, have not a great deal to teach
us, whether because, at the moment when
they can speak to us, they have nothing
yet to tell us, or because, at the moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>when they might have something to
reveal to us, they are no longer able to
do so, but withdraw for ever and lose sight
of us in the immensity which they are
exploring.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />THE FATE OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>Let us dispense with their uncertain aid
and endeavour to make our way to the
other side alone. To return then to the
theories which we were examining before
these necessary digressions, it would seem
that survival with our present consciousness
is nearly as impossible and as incomprehensible
as total annihilation. Moreover, even
if it were admissible, it could not be dreadful.
It is certain that, when the body disappears,
all physical sufferings will disappear at the
same time; for we cannot imagine a spirit
suffering in a body which it no longer
possesses. With them will vanish simultaneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>all that we call mental or moral
sufferings, seeing that all of them, if we
examine them well, spring from the ties and
habits of our senses. Our spirit feels the
reaction of the sufferings of our body, or
of the bodies that surround it; it cannot
suffer in itself or through itself. Slighted
affection, shattered love, disappointments,
failures, despair, betrayal, personal humiliations,
as well as the sorrows and the loss of
those whom it loves, acquire their potent
sting only by passing through the body which
it animates. Outside its own pain, which
is the pain of not knowing, the spirit, once
delivered from its flesh, could suffer only in
the recollection of the flesh. It is possible
that it still grieves over the troubles of those
whom it has left behind on earth. But to
its eyes, since it no longer reckons the days,
these troubles will seem so brief that it will
not grasp their duration; and, knowing
what they are and knowing whither they
lead, it will not behold their severity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spirit is insensible to all that is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>happiness. It is made only for infinite joy,
which is the joy of knowing and understanding.
It can grieve only at perceiving
its own limits; but to perceive those limits,
when there are no more bonds to space and
time, is already to transcend them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is now a question of knowing whether
that spirit, sheltered from all sorrow, will
remain itself, will perceive and recognize
itself in the bosom of infinity; and up to
what point it is important that it should
recognize itself. This brings us to the
problems of survival without consciousness,
or survival with a consciousness different
from that of to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Survival without consciousness seems at
first sight the more probable. From the
point of view of the good or ill awaiting us
on the other side of the grave, it amounts
to annihilation. It is lawful, therefore, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>those who prefer the easiest solution and that
most consistent with the present state of
human thought, to limit their anxiety to
that. They have nothing to dread; for,
on close inspection, every fear, if any remained,
should deck itself with hopes. The
body disintegrates and can no longer suffer;
the mind, separated from the source of
pleasure and pain, is extinguished, scattered
and lost in a boundless darkness; and what
comes is the great peace so often prayed for,
the sleep without measure, without dreams
and without awakening.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this is only a solution that fosters
indolence. If we press those who speak of
survival without consciousness, we perceive
that they mean only their present consciousness,
for man conceives no other; and we
have just seen that it is almost impossible
for that manner of consciousness to persist in
infinity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unless, indeed, they would deny every
sort of consciousness, even that cosmic
consciousness into which their own will fall.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>But this were to solve very quickly and very
blindly, with a stroke of the sword in the
night, the greatest and most mysterious
question that can arise in a man’s brain.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that, in the depths of our
thought limited on every side, we shall never
be able to form the least idea of an infinite
consciousness. There is even an essential
antinomy between the words consciousness
and infinity. To speak of consciousness is
to mean the most definite thing conceivable
in the finite; consciousness, properly
speaking, is the finite huddled into itself in
order to discover and feel its closest limits,
to the end that it may enjoy them as closely
as possible. On the other hand, it is impossible
for us to separate the idea of intelligence
from the idea of consciousness. Any intelligence
that does not seem capable of
transforming itself into consciousness becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>for us a mysterious phenomenon to
which we give names more mysterious still,
lest we should have to admit that we understand
nothing of it at all. Now, on this
little earth of ours, which is but a dot in
space, we see expended in every scale of life
(remember, for instance, the wonderful
combinations and organisms of the insect
world) a mass of intelligence so vast that our
human intelligence cannot even dream of
assessing it. Everything that exists—and
man first of all—is incessantly drawing upon
that inexhaustible reserve. We are therefore
irresistibly driven to ask ourselves if
that cosmic intelligence is not the emanation
of an infinite consciousness, or if it must not,
sooner or later, elaborate one. And this
sets us tossing between two irreducible
impossibilities. What is most probable is
that here again we are judging everything
from the lowlands of our anthropomorphism.
At the summit of our infinitesimal life, we
see only intelligence and consciousness, the
extreme point of thought; and from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>we infer that, at the summits of all lives,
there could be naught but intelligence and
consciousness, whereas these perhaps occupy
only an inferior place in the hierarchy of
spiritual or other possibilities.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>

<p class='c008'>Survival absolutely denuded of consciousness
would, therefore, be possible only if
we denied a cosmic consciousness. As soon
as we admit this consciousness, under whatsoever
form, we are bound to share in it;
and, up to a certain point, the question
is indistinguishable from that of the
continuance of a more or less modified consciousness.
There is, for the moment, no
hope of solving it; but we are free to grope
in its darkness, which is not perhaps equally
dense at all points.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here begins the open sea. Here begins
the glorious adventure, the only one abreast
with human curiosity, the only one that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>soars as high as its highest longing. Let us
accustom ourselves to regard death as a form
of life which we do not yet understand; let
us learn to look upon it with the same eye
that looks upon birth; and soon our mind
will be accompanied to the steps of the tomb
with the same glad expectation that greets a
birth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suppose that a child in its mother’s womb
were endowed with a certain consciousness;
that unborn twins, for instance, could, in
some obscure fashion, exchange their impressions
and communicate their hopes and
fears to each other. Having known naught
but the warm maternal shades, they would
not feel straitened nor unhappy there. They
would probably have no other idea than to
prolong as long as possible that life of abundance
free from cares and of sleep free from
alarms. But, if, even as we are aware that
we must die, they too knew that they must be
born, that is to say, suddenly leave the shelter
of that gentle darkness and abandon for ever
that captive but peaceful existence, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>precipitated into an absolutely different,
unimaginable and boundless world, how
great would be their anxieties and their
fears! And yet there is no reason why our
own anxieties and fears should be more
justified and less ridiculous. The character,
the spirit, the intentions, the benevolence
or the indifference of the unknown to which
we are subject do not alter between our birth
and our death. We remain always in the
same infinity, in the same universe. It is
perfectly reasonable and legitimate to persuade
ourselves that the tomb is no more
dreadful than the cradle. It would even be
legitimate and reasonable to accept the
cradle only on account of the tomb. If,
before being born, we were permitted to
choose between the great peace of non-existence
and a life that should not be completed
by the glorious hour of death, which
of us, knowing what he ought to know,
would accept the disquieting problem of an
existence that would not lead to the reassuring
mystery of its end? Which of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>would wish to come into a world where we
can learn so little, if he did not know that he
must enter it if he would leave it and learn
more? The best thing about life is that it
prepares this hour for us, that it is the one
and only road leading to the magic gateway
and into that incomparable mystery where
misfortunes and sufferings will no longer be
possible, because we shall have lost the body
that produced them; where the worst that
can befall us is the dreamless sleep which we
number among the greatest boons on earth;
where, lastly, it is almost unimaginable
that a thought should not survive to
mingle with the substance of the universe,
that is to say, with infinity, which, if it
be not a waste of indifference, can be
nothing but a sea of joy.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>Before fathoming that sea, let us remark
to those who aspire to maintain their ego
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>that they are calling for the sufferings which
they dread. The ego implies limits. The
ego cannot subsist except in so far as it is
separated from that which surrounds it.
The stronger the ego, the narrower its limits
and the clearer the separation. The more
painful too; for the mind, if it remain as
we know it—and we are not able to imagine
it different—will no sooner have seen its
limits than it will wish to overstep them;
and, the more separated it feels, the greater
will be its longing to unite with that which
lies outside. There will therefore be an
eternal struggle between its being and its
aspirations. And really it would have served
no object to be born and die only to arrive
at these interminable contests. Have we
not here yet one more proof that our ego, as
we conceive it, could never subsist in the
infinity where it must needs go, since it
cannot go elsewhere? It behoves us therefore
to clear away conceptions that emanate
only from our body, even as the mists that
veil the daylight from our sight emanate only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>from the lowlands. Pascal has said, once and
for all:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The narrow limits of our being conceal
infinity from our view.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>6</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand—for we must keep
nothing back, nor turn from the adverse
darkness should it seem nearest to the truth,
nor show any bias—on the other hand, we
can grant to those who yearn to remain as
they are that the survival of an atom of
themselves would suffice for a new entrance
into an infinity from which their body no
longer separates them.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it seems impossible that anything—a
movement, a vibration, a radiation—should
stop or disappear, why then should thought
be lost? There will, no doubt, subsist more
than one idea powerful enough to allure the
new ego, which will nourish itself and thrive
on all that it will find in that boundless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>environment, just as the other ego, on this
earth, nourished itself and throve on all
that it met there. Since we have been able
to acquire our present consciousness, why
should it be impossible for us to acquire
another? For that ego which is so dear to us
and which we believe ourselves to possess
was not made in a day; it is not at present
what it was at the hour of our birth. Much
more chance than purpose has entered into
it; and much more foreign substance than
any inborn substance which it contained.
It is but a long series of acquisitions and
transformations, of which we do not become
aware until the awakening of our memory;
and its kernel, of which we do not know the
nature, is perhaps more immaterial and less
concrete than a thought. If the new
environment which we enter on leaving our
mother’s womb transforms us to such a
point that there is, so to speak, no connexion
between the embryo that we were and the
man that we have become, is it not right to
think that the far newer, stranger, wider and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>richer environment which we enter on
quitting life will transform us even more?
We can see in what happens to us here a
figure of what awaits us elsewhere and can
readily admit that our spiritual being,
liberated from its body, if it does not mingle
at the first onset with the infinite, will
develop itself there gradually, will choose
itself a substance and, no longer trammelled
by space and time, will go on for ever
growing. It is very possible that our loftiest
wishes of to-day will become the law of our
future development. It is very possible that
our best thoughts will welcome us on the
farther shore and that the quality of our
intellect will determine that of the infinite
which crystallizes around it. Every hypothesis
is permissible and every question,
provided it be addressed to happiness; for
unhappiness is no longer able to answer us.
It finds no place in the human imagination
that methodically explores the future. And,
whatever be the force that survives us and
presides over our existence in the other world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>this existence, to presume the worst, could be
no less great, no less happy than that of
to-day. It will have no other career than
infinity; and infinity is nothing if it be not
felicity. In any case, it seems fairly certain
that we spend in this world the only narrow,
grudging, obscure and sorrowful moment of
our destiny.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>

<p class='c008'>We have said that the peculiar sorrow of
the mind is the sorrow of not knowing or
not understanding, which includes the sorrow
of being powerless; for he who knows the
supreme causes, being no longer paralyzed
by matter, becomes one with them and acts
with them; and he who understands ends by
approving, or else the universe would be a
mistake, which is not possible, an infinite
mistake being inconceivable. I do not
believe that another sorrow of the sheer
mind can be imagined. The only one sorrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>which, at first thought, might seem admissible—and
which, in any case, could be but
ephemeral—would arise from the sight of
the pain and misery remaining on the earth
which we have left. But this sorrow, after
all, would be but one aspect and an insignificant
phase of the sorrow of being
powerless and of not understanding. As for
the latter, though it is not only beyond the
domain of our intelligence, but even at an
insuperable distance from our imagination,
we may say that it would be intolerable only
if it were without hope. But, for that, the
universe would have to abandon any attempt
to understand itself, or else admit within
itself an object that remained for ever foreign
to it. Either the mind will not perceive its
limits and, consequently, will not suffer
from them, or else it will overstep them as it
perceives them; for how could the universe
have parts eternally condemned to form no
part of itself and of its knowledge? Hence
we cannot understand that the torture of
not understanding, supposing it to exist for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>a moment, should not end by absorption in
the state of infinity, which, if it be not
happiness as we comprehend it, could be
naught but an indifference higher and
purer than joy.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE TWO ASPECTS OF INFINITY</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>Let us turn our thoughts towards it.
The problem goes beyond humanity
and embraces all things. It is possible, I
think, to view infinity under two distinct
aspects. Let us contemplate the first of
them. We are plunged in a universe that
has no limits in space or time. It can neither
go forward nor go back. It has no origin.
It never began, nor will it ever end. The
myriads of years behind it are even as the
myriads which it has yet to unroll. From
all time it has been at the boundless centre
of the days. It could have no aim, for, if it
had one, it would have attained it in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>infinity of the years that lie behind us;
besides, that aim would be outside itself and,
if there were anything outside it, it would be
bounded by that thing and would cease to
be infinity. It is not making for anywhere,
for it would have arrived there; consequently,
all that the worlds within its pale,
all that we ourselves do can have no influence
upon it. All that it will do it has done.
All that it has not done remains undone
because it can never do it. If it have no
mind, it will never have one. If it have one,
that mind has been at its climax from all
time and will remain there, changeless and
immovable. It is as young as it has ever
been and as old as it will ever be. It has
made in the past all the efforts and all the
trials which it will make in the future; and,
as all the possible combinations have been
exhausted since what we cannot even call
the beginning, it does not seem as if that
which has not taken place in the eternity
that stretches before our birth can happen
in the eternity that will follow our death.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>If it have not become conscious, it will never
become conscious; if it know not what it
wishes, it will continue in ignorance, hopelessly,
knowing all or knowing nothing and
remaining as near its end as its beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the gloomiest thought to which
man can attain. So far, I do not think that
its depths have been sufficiently sounded.
If it were really irrefutable—and some may
contend that it is—if it actually contained
the last word of the great riddle, it would
be almost impossible to live in its shadow.
Naught save the certainty that our conceptions
of time and space are illusive and
absurd can lighten the abyss wherein our
last hope would perish.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>This universe thus conceived would be, if
not intelligible, at least admissible by our
reason; but in that universe float billions of
worlds limited by space and time. They are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>born, they die and they are born again.
They form part of the whole; and we see,
therefore, that parts of that which has
neither beginning nor end themselves begin
and end. We, in fact, know only those parts;
and they are of a number so infinite that in
our eyes they fill all infinity. That which
is going nowhere teems with that which
appears to be going somewhere. That
which has always known what it wants,
or will never learn, seems to be eternally
experimenting with more or less ill-success.
At what goal is it aiming, since it is already
there? Everything that we discover in
that which could not possibly have an object
looks as though it were pursuing one with
inconceivable ardour; and the mind that
animates what we see in that which should
know everything and possess itself seems to
know nothing and to seek itself without intermission.
Thus all that is apparent to our
senses in infinity gainsays that which our
reason is compelled to ascribe to it. According
as we fathom it, we come to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>how deep is our want of understanding; and,
the more we strive to penetrate the two incomprehensible
problems that stand face to
face, the more they contradict each other.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>What will become of us amid all this
confusion? Shall we leave the finite wherein
we dwell to be swallowed up in this or the
other infinite? In other words, shall we
end by absorption in the infinite which our
reason conceives, or shall we remain eternally
in that which our eyes behold, that is to
say, in numberless changing and ephemeral
worlds? Shall we never leave those worlds
which seem doomed to die and to be reborn
eternally, to enter at last into that which,
from all eternity, can neither have been born
nor have died and which exists without
either future or past? Shall we one day
escape, with all that surrounds us, from this
unhappy speculation, to find our way at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>last into peace, wisdom, changeless and
boundless consciousness, or into hopeless
unconsciousness? Shall we have the fate
which our senses foretell, or that which our
intelligence demands? Or are both senses
and intelligence only illusions, puny implements,
vain weapons of an hour, which we
never intended to examine or defy the universe?
If there really be a contradiction, is
it wise to accept it and to deem impossible
that which we do not understand, seeing that
we understand almost nothing? Is truth
not at an immeasurable distance from these
inconsistencies which appear to us enormous
and irreducible and which, doubtless, are of
no more importance than the rain that falls
upon the sea?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>

<p class='c008'>But, even to our poor understanding
to-day, the discrepancy between the infinity
conceived by our reason and that perceived
by our senses is perhaps more apparent than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>real. When we say that, in a universe that
has existed since all eternity, every experiment,
every possible combination has been made;
when we declare that there is no chance that
what has not taken place in the uncountable
past can take place in the uncountable
future, our imagination perhaps attributes
to the infinity of time a preponderance which
it cannot possess. In truth, all that infinity
contains must be as infinite as the time at its
disposal; and the chances, encounters and
combinations that lie therein have not been
exhausted in the eternity that has gone
before us any more than they could be in
the eternity that will come after us. The
infinity of time is no vaster than the infinity
of the substance of the universe. Events,
forces, chances, causes, effects, phenomena,
fusions, combinations, coincidences, harmonies,
unions, possibilities, lives are represented
in it by innumerous numbers that
entirely fill a bottomless and vergeless abyss
where they have been shaken together from
what we call the beginning of the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that had no beginning and where they will
be stirred up until the end of a world that
will have no end. There is, therefore, no
climax, no changelessness, no immovability.
It is probable that the universe is seeking and
finding itself every day, that it has not become
entirely conscious and does not yet
know what it wants. It is possible that its
ideal is still veiled by the shadow of its
immensity; it is also possible that experiments
and chances are following one upon
the other in unimaginable worlds, compared
wherewith all those which we see on starry
nights are no more than a pinch of gold-dust
in the ocean depths. Lastly, if either be
true, it is also true that we ourselves, or what
remains of us—it matters not—will profit
one day by those experiments and those
chances. That which has not yet happened
may suddenly supervene; and the next state,
with the supreme wisdom which will recognize
and be able to establish that state, is
perhaps ready to arise from the clash of
circumstances. It would not be at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>astonishing if the consciousness of the
universe, in the endeavour to form itself,
had not yet encountered the combination
of necessary chances and if human thought
were actually supporting one of those decisive
chances. Here there is a hope. Small
as man and his brain may appear, they have
exactly the value of the most enormous
forces that they are able to conceive, since
there is neither great nor small in the immeasurable;
and, if our body equalled the
dimensions of all the worlds which our
eyes can see, it would have exactly the same
weight and the same importance as compared
with the universe that it has to-day.
The mind alone perhaps occupies in infinity
a space which comparisons do not reduce to
nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>For the rest, if everything must be said,
at the cost of constantly and shamelessly
contradicting one’s self in the dark, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>return to the first supposition, the idea of
possible progress, it is extremely probable
that this again is one of those childish disorders
of our brain which prevent us from
seeing the thing that is. It is quite as
probable, as we have seen above, that there
never was, that there never will be any
progress, because there could not be a goal.
At most there may occur a few ephemeral
combinations which, to our poor eyes, will
seem happier or more beautiful than others.
Even so we think gold more beautiful than
the mud in the street, or the flower in a
splendid garden happier than the stone
at the bottom of a drain; but all this,
obviously, is of no importance, has no
corresponding reality and proves nothing
in particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more we reflect upon it, the more
pronounced is the infirmity of our intelligence
which cannot succeed in reconciling
the idea of progress and even the idea of
experiment with the supreme idea of infinity.
Although nature has been incessantly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>indefatigably repeating herself before our
eyes for thousands of years, reproducing the
same trees and the same animals, we cannot
contrive to understand why the universe
indefinitely recommences experiments that
have been made billions of times. It is
inevitable that, in the innumerable combinations
that have been and are being made
in termless time and boundless space, there
have been and still are millions of planets
and consequently millions of human races
exactly similar to our own, side by side with
myriads of others more or less different from
it. Let us not say to ourselves that it would
require an unimaginable concourse of circumstances
to reproduce a globe like to our
earth in every respect. We must remember
that we are in the infinite and that this
unimaginable concourse must necessarily take
place in the innumerousness which we are
unable to imagine. Though it need billions
and billions of cases for two features to
coincide, those billions and billions will
encumber infinity no more than would a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>single case. Place an infinite number of
worlds in an infinite number of infinitely
diverse circumstances: there will always be
an infinite number for which those circumstances
will be alike; if not, we should be
setting bounds to our idea of the universe,
which would forthwith become more incomprehensible
still. From the moment that
we insist sufficiently upon that thought, we
necessarily arrive at these conclusions. If
they have not struck us hitherto, it is because
we never go to the farthest point of our
imagination. Now the farthest point of our
imagination is but the beginning of reality
and gives us only a small, purely human
universe, which, vast as it may seem, dances
in the real universe like an apple on the sea.
I repeat, if we do not admit that thousands
of worlds, similar in all points to our own,
in spite of the billions of adverse chances,
have always existed and still exist to-day,
we are sapping the foundations of the only
possible conception of the universe or of
infinity.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
<h3 class='c007'>6</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now how is it that those millions of
exactly similar human races, which from all
time suffer what we have suffered and are
still suffering, profit us nothing, that all their
experiences and all their schools have had
no influence upon our first efforts and that
everything has to be done again and begun
again incessantly?</p>

<p class='c009'>As we see, the two theories balance each
other. It is well to acquire by degrees the
habit of understanding nothing. There
remains to us the faculty of choosing the less
gloomy of the two or persuading ourselves
that the mists of the other exist only in our
brain. As that strange visionary, William
Blake, said:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nor is it possible to thought</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A greater than itself to know.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let us add that it is not possible for it to
know anything other than itself. What we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>do not know would be enough to create the
world afresh; and what we do know cannot
add one moment to the life of a fly. Who
can tell but that our chief mistake lies in
believing that an intelligence, were it an
intelligence thousands of times as great as
ours, directs the universe? It may be a
force of quite another nature, a force that
differs as widely from that on which our
brain prides itself as electricity, for instance,
differs from the wind that blows. That is
why it is fairly probable that our mind,
however powerful it become, will always
grope in mystery. If it be certain that everything
in us must also be in nature, because
everything comes to us from her, if the
mind and all the logic which it has placed
at the culminating point of our being direct
or seem to direct all the actions of our life,
it by no means follows that there is not in
the universe a force greatly superior to
thought, a force having no imaginable relation
to the mind, a force which animates and
governs all things according to other laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and of which nothing is found in us
but almost imperceptible traces, even
as almost imperceptible traces of thought
are all that can be found in plants and
minerals.</p>

<p class='c009'>In any case, there is nothing here to make
us lose courage. It is necessarily the human
illusion of evil, ugliness, uselessness and
impossibility that is to blame. We must
wait not for the universe to be transformed,
but for our intelligence to expand or to take
part in the other force; and we must maintain
our confidence in a world which knows
nothing of our conceptions of purpose and
progress, because it doubtless has ideas
whereof we have no idea, a world, moreover,
which could scarcely wish itself harm.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>

<p class='c008'>“These are but vain speculations,” it
will be said. “What matters, after all, the
idea which we form of those things which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>belong to the unknowable, seeing that the
unknowable, were we a thousand times as
intelligent as we are, is closed to us for ever
and that the idea which we form of it will
never have any value?”</p>

<p class='c009'>That is true; but there are degrees in our
ignorance of the unknowable; and each of
those degrees marks a triumph of the intelligence.
To estimate more and more
completely the extent of what it does not
know is all that man’s knowledge can hope
for. Our idea of the unknowable was and
always will be valueless, I admit; but it
nevertheless is and will remain the most
important idea of mankind. All our
morality, all that is in the highest degree
noble and profound in our existence has
always been based on this idea devoid of real
value. To-day, as yesterday, even though
it be possible to recognize more clearly that
it is too incomplete and relative ever to have
any actual value, it is necessary to carry it
as high and as far as we can. It alone creates
the only atmosphere wherein the best part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>of ourselves can live. Yes, it is the
unknowable into which we shall not
enter; but that is no reason for saying to
ourselves:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am closing all the doors and all the
windows; henceforth, I shall interest myself
only in things which my everyday intelligence
can compass. Those things alone
have the right to influence my actions and
my thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Where should we arrive at that rate?
What things can my intelligence compass?
Is there a thing in this world that can be
separated from the inconceivable? Since
there is no means of eliminating that inconceivable,
it is reasonable and salutary to
make the best of it and therefore to imagine
it as stupendously vast as we are able. The
gravest reproach that can be brought against
the positive religions and notably against
Christianity is that they have too often, if
not in theory, at least in practice, encouraged
such a narrowing of the mystery of
the universe. By broadening it, we broaden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the space wherein our mind will move. It
is for us what we make it: let us then form
it of all that we can reach on the horizon of
ourselves. As for the mystery itself, we
shall, of course, never reach it; but we have
a much greater chance of approaching it by
facing it and going whither it draws us than
by turning our backs upon it and returning
to that place where we well know that it no
longer is. Not by diminishing our thoughts
shall we diminish the distance that separates
us from the ultimate truths; but by enlarging
them as much as possible we are sure
of deceiving ourselves as little as possible.
And the loftier our idea of the infinite, the
more buoyant and the purer becomes the
spiritual atmosphere wherein we live and
the wider and deeper the horizon against
which our thoughts and feelings stand out,
the horizon which is all their life and which
they inspire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perpetually to construct ideas requiring
the utmost stretch of our faculties,” wrote
Herbert Spencer, “and perpetually to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>that such ideas must be abandoned as futile
imaginations, may realize to us more fully
than any other course, the greatness of that
which we vainly strive to grasp.... By
continually seeking to know and being continually
thrown back with a deepened conviction
of the impossibility of knowing, we
may keep alive the consciousness that it is
alike our highest wisdom and our highest
duty to regard that through which all things
exist as the Unknowable.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>8</h3>

<p class='c008'>Whatever the ultimate truth may be,
whether we admit the abstract, absolute and
perfect infinity—the changeless, immovable
infinity which has attained perfection and
which knows everything, to which our reason
tends—or whether we prefer that offered
to us by the evidence, undeniable here
below, of our senses—the infinity which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>seeks itself, which is still evolving and not
yet established—it behoves us above all to
foresee in it our fate, which, for that matter,
must, in either case, end by absorption in
that very infinity.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />OUR FATE IN THOSE INFINITIES</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>The first infinity, the ideal infinity,
corresponds most nearly with the requirements
of our reason, which is not a
reason for giving it the preference. It is
impossible for us to foresee what we shall
become in it, because it seems to exclude
any becoming. It therefore but remains
for us to address ourselves to the second,
to that which we see and imagine
in time and space. Furthermore, it is
possible that it may precede the other.
However absolute our conception of the
universe, we have seen that we can always
admit that what has not taken place in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>eternity before us will happen in the eternity
after us and that there is nothing save an
untold number of chances to prevent the
universe from acquiring in the end that
perfect consciousness which will establish it
at its zenith.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>

<p class='c008'>Behold us, then, in the infinity of those
worlds, the stellar infinity, the infinity of
the heavens, which assuredly veils other
things from our eyes, but which cannot be a
total illusion. It seems to us to be peopled
only with objects—planets, suns, stars,
nebulæ, atoms, imponderous fluids—which
move, unite and separate, repel and attract
one another, which shrink and expand, are
for ever shifting and never arrive, which
measure space in that which has no confines
and number the hours in that which
has no term. In a word, we are in an
infinity that seems to have almost the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>character and the same habits as that
power in the midst of which we breathe
and which, upon our earth, we call nature
or life.</p>

<p class='c009'>What will be our fate in that infinity?
We are asking ourselves no idle question,
even if we should unite with it after losing
all consciousness, all notion of the ego,
even if we should exist there as no more
than a little nameless substance—soul or
matter, we cannot tell—suspended in the
equally nameless abyss that replaces time
and space. It is not an idle question, for
it concerns the history of the worlds or of
the universe; and this history, far more
than that of our petty existence, is our own
great history, in which perhaps something
of ourselves or something incomparably
better and vaster will end by meeting us
again some day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>
<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Shall we be unhappy there? It is hardly
reassuring when we consider the ways of
nature and remember that we form part of
a universe that has not yet gathered its
wisdom. We have seen, it is true, that good
and bad fortune exist only in so far as regards
our body and that, when we have lost
the organ of suffering, we shall not meet
any of the earthly sorrows again. But our
anxiety does not end here; and will not our
mind, lingering upon our erstwhile sorrows,
drifting derelict from world to world, unknown
to itself in an unknowable that seeks
itself hopelessly, will not our mind know
here the frightful torture of which we
have already spoken and which is doubtless
the last that imagination can touch with
its wing? Finally, if there were nothing
left of our body and our mind, there would
still remain the matter and the spirit (or,
at least, the obviously single force to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>we give that double name) which composed
them and whose fate must be no more
indifferent to us than our own fate; for, let
us repeat, from our death onwards, the
adventure of the universe becomes our own
adventure. Let us not, therefore, say to
ourselves:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can it matter? We shall not be
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall be there always, because everything
will be there.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>

<p class='c008'>And will this everything wherein we shall
be included, in a world ever seeking itself,
continue a prey to new and perpetual and
perhaps painful experiences? Since the
part that we were was unhappy, why should
the part that we shall be enjoy a better
fortune? Who can assure us that yonder
unending combinations and endeavours will
not be more sorrowful, more stupid and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>baneful than those which we are leaving;
and how shall we explain that these have
come about after so many millions of others
which ought to have opened the eyes of the
genius of infinity? It is idle to persuade
ourselves, as Hindu wisdom would, that our
sorrows are but illusions and appearances:
it is none the less true that they make us very
really unhappy. Has the universe elsewhere
a more complete consciousness, a more just
and serene understanding than on this earth
and in the worlds which we discern? And,
if it be true that it has somewhere attained
that better understanding, why does the
mind that presides over the destinies of our
earth not profit by it? Is no communication
possible between worlds which must
have been born of the same idea and which
lie in its depths? What would be the
mystery of that isolation? Are we to
believe that the earth marks the farthest
stage and the most successful experiment?
What, then, can the mind of the universe
have done and against what darkness must it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>have struggled, to have come only to this?
But, on the other hand, that darkness and
those barriers which can have come only
from itself, since they could have arisen no
elsewhere, have they the power to stay its
progress? Who then could have set those
insoluble problems to infinity and from what
more remote and profound region than itself
could they have issued? Some one, after all,
must know the answer to them; and, as
behind infinity there can be none that is
not infinity itself, it is impossible to imagine
a malignant will in a will that leaves no point
around it which is not wholly covered. Or
are the experiments begun in the stars continued
mechanically, by virtue of the force
acquired, without regard to their uselessness
and their pitiful consequences, according to
the custom of nature, who knows nothing
of our parsimony and squanders the suns in
space as she does the seed on earth, knowing
that nothing can be lost? Or, again, is the
whole question of our peace and happiness,
like that of the fate of the worlds, reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to knowing whether or not the infinity of
endeavours and combinations be equal to
that of eternity? Or, lastly, to come to
what is most likely, is it we who deceive
ourselves, who know nothing, who see nothing
and who consider imperfect that which is
perhaps faultless, we, who are but an infinitesimal
fragment of the intelligence which
we judge by the aid of the little shreds of
understanding which it has vouchsafed to
lend us?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>How could we reply, how could our
thoughts and glances penetrate the infinite
and the invisible, we who do not understand
nor even see the thing by which we see and
which is the source of all our thoughts? In
fact, as has been very justly observed, man
does not see light itself. He sees only
matter, or rather the small part of the great
worlds which he knows by the name of
matter, touched by light. He does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>perceive the immense rays that cross the
heavens save at the moment when they are
stopped by an object akin to those with which
his eye is familiar upon this earth: were it
otherwise, the whole space filled with innumerable
suns and boundless forces, instead
of being an abyss of absolute darkness,
absorbing and extinguishing pencils of light
that shoot across it from every side, would be
but a monstrous and unbearable ocean of
flashes. And, if we do not see the light, at
least we think we know a few of its rays or
its reflexions; but we are absolutely ignorant
of that which is unquestionably the essential
law of the universe, namely, gravitation.
What is that force, the most powerful of all
and the least visible, imperceptible to our
senses, without form, without colour, without
temperature, without substance, without
savour and without voice, but so awful that
it suspends and moves in space all the worlds
which we see and all those which we shall
never know? More rapid, more subtle,
more incorporeal than thought, it wields
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>such sway over everything that exists, from
the infinitely great to the infinitely small,
that there is not a grain of sand upon our
earth nor a drop of blood in our veins but
are penetrated, wrought upon and quickened
by it until they act at every moment upon the
farthest planet of the last solar system that
we struggle to imagine beyond the bounds
of our imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shakspeare’s famous lines,</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>have long since become utterly inadequate.
There are no longer more things than our
philosophy can dream of or imagine: there
is none but things which it cannot dream of,
there is nothing but the unimaginable; and,
if we do not even see the light, which is the
one thing that we believed we saw, it may
be said that there is nothing all around us
but the invisible.</p>

<p class='c009'>We move in the illusion of seeing and
knowing that which is strictly indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>to our little lives. As for all the rest, which
is well-nigh everything, our organs not only
debar us from reaching, seeing or feeling it,
but even restrain us from suspecting what it
is, just as they would prevent us from understanding
it, if an intelligence of a different
order were to bethink itself of revealing
or explaining it to us. The number and
volume of those mysteries is as boundless as
the universe itself. If mankind were one
day to draw near to those which to-day it
deems the greatest and the most inaccessible,
such as the origin and the aim of life, it
would at once behold rising up behind them,
like eternal mountains, others quite as great
and quite as unfathomable; and so on,
without end. In relation to that which it
would have to know in order to hold the key
to this world, it would always find itself at the
same point of central ignorance. It would be
just the same if we possessed an intelligence
several million times greater and more penetrating
than ours. All that its miraculously increased
power could discover would encounter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>limits no less impassable than at present.
All is boundless in that which has no bounds.
We shall be the eternal prisoners of the
universe. It is therefore impossible for us
to appreciate in any degree whatsoever, in
the smallest conceivable respect, the present
state of the universe and to say, as long as
we are men, whether it follows a straight
line or describes an immense circle, whether
it is growing wiser or madder, whether it is
advancing towards the eternity which has
no end or retracing its steps towards that
which had no beginning. Our sole privilege
within our tiny confines is to struggle towards
that which appears to us the best and to
remain heroically persuaded that no part of
what we do within those confines can ever
be wholly lost.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>6</h3>

<p class='c008'>But let not all these insoluble questions
drive us towards fear. From the point of
view of our future beyond the grave, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>in no way necessary that we should have
an answer to everything. Whether the universe
have already found its consciousness,
whether it find it one day or seek it everlastingly,
it could not exist for the purpose
of being unhappy and of suffering, neither
in its entirety, nor in any one of its parts;
and it matters little if the latter be invisible
or incommensurable, considering that the
smallest is as great as the greatest in what has
neither limit nor measure. To torture a
point is the same thing as to torture the
worlds; and, if it torture the worlds, it is
its own substance that it tortures. Its very
fate, wherein we have our part, protects us;
for we are simply morsels of infinity. It is
inseparable from us as we are inseparable
from it. Its breath is our breath, its aim
is our aim and we bear within us all its
mysteries. We participate in it everywhere.
There is naught in us that escapes it; there
is naught in it but belongs to us. It extends
us, fills us, traverses us on every side. In
space and time and in that which, beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>space and time, has as yet no name, we
represent it and summarize it completely,
with all its properties and all its future; and,
if its immensity terrifies us, we are as terrifying
as itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, therefore, we had to suffer in it, our
sufferings could be but ephemeral; and
nothing matters that is not eternal. It is
possible, although somewhat incomprehensible,
that parts should err and go astray;
but it is impossible that sorrow should be
one of its lasting and necessary laws; for it
would have brought that law to bear against
itself. In like manner, the universe is and
must be its own law and its sole master: if
not, the law or the master whom it must
obey would be the universe alone; and the
centre of a word which we pronounce without
being able to grasp its scope would be simply
shifted. If it be unhappy, that means that
it wills its own unhappiness; if it will its
unhappiness, it is mad; and, if it appear to
us mad, that means that our reason works
contrary to everything and to the only laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>possible, seeing that they are eternal, or, to
speak more humbly, that it judges what it
wholly fails to understand.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>7</h3>

<p class='c008'>Everything, therefore, must end, or perhaps
already be, if not in a state of happiness,
at least in a state exempt from all suffering,
all anxiety, all lasting unhappiness; and
what, after all, is our happiness upon this
earth, if it be not the absence of sorrow,
anxiety and unhappiness?</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is childish to talk of happiness and
unhappiness where infinity is in question.
The idea which we entertain of happiness
and unhappiness is something so special, so
human, so fragile that it does not exceed our
stature and falls to dust as soon as we take
it out of its little sphere. It proceeds
entirely from a few contingencies of our
nerves, which are made to appreciate very
slight happenings, but which could as easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>have felt everything the opposite way and
taken pleasure in that which is now pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not know if my readers remember
the striking passage in which Sir William
Crookes shows how well-nigh all that we
consider as essential laws of nature would be
falsified in the eyes of a microscopic man,
while forces of which we are almost wholly
ignorant, such as surface-tension, capillarity,
the Brownian movements, would preponderate.
Walking on a cabbage-leaf, for instance,
after the dew had fallen, and seeing it studded
with huge crystal globes, he would infer
that water was a solid body which assumes
spherical form and rises in the air. At no
great distance, he might come to a pond,
when he would observe that this same
matter, instead of rising upwards, now seems
to slope downwards in a vast curve from the
brink. If he managed, with the aid of his
friends, to throw into the water one of those
enormous steel bars which we call needles,
he would see that it made a sort of concave
trough on the surface and floated tranquilly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>From these experiments and a thousand
others which he might make, he would naturally
deduce theories diametrically opposed to
those upon which our entire existence is
based. It would be the same if the changes
were made in the direction of time, to take
an hypothesis imagined by the philosopher
William James:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose we were able, within the length
of a second, to note distinctly ten thousand
events instead of barely ten, as now; if our
life were then destined to hold the same
number of impressions it might be a thousand
times as short. We should live less than a
month, and personally know nothing of the
change of seasons. If born in winter, we
should believe in summer as we now believe
in the heats of the carboniferous era. The
motions of organic beings would be so slow
to our senses as to be inferred, not seen.
The sun would stand still in the sky, the
moon be almost free from change and so
on. But now reverse the hypothesis, and suppose
a being to get only one thousandth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>part of the sensations that we get in a
given time, and consequently to live a
thousand times as long. Winters and
summers will be to him like quarters
of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter
growing plants will shoot into being so
rapidly as to appear instantaneous creations;
annual shrubs will rise and fall
from the earth like restlessly boiling water-springs;
the motions of animals will be as
invisible as are to us the movements of
bullets and cannon-balls; the sun will scour
through the sky like a meteor, leaving a
fiery trail behind him, &amp;c. That such
imaginary cases (barring the super-human
longevity) may be realized somewhere in
the animal kingdom, it would be rash to
deny.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>
<h3 class='c007'>8</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We believe that we see nothing hanging
over us but catastrophes, deaths, torments
and disasters; we shiver at the mere thought
of the great interplanetary spaces, with their
intense cold and their awful and gloomy
solitudes; and we imagine that the worlds
that revolve through space are as unhappy as
ourselves because they freeze, or disaggregate,
or clash together, or are consumed in unutterable
flames. We infer from this that
the genius of the universe is an abominable
tyrant, seized with a monstrous madness,
delighting only in the torture of itself and
all that it contains. To millions of stars,
each many thousand times larger than our
sun, to nebulæ whose nature and dimensions
no figure, no word in our language is able to
express, we attribute our momentary sensibility,
the little ephemeral play of our nerves;
and we are convinced that life there must be
impossible or appalling, because we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>feel too hot or too cold. It were much
wiser to say to ourselves that it would need
but a trifle, a few papillæ more or less to our
skin, the slightest modification of our eyes
and ears, to turn the temperature of space,
its silence and its darkness into a delicious
spring-time, an incomparable music, a divine
light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing is too wonderful to be true,”
said Faraday.</p>

<p class='c009'>It were much more reasonable to persuade
ourselves that the catastrophes our imagination
sees there are life itself, the joy and one
or other of those immense festivals of mind
and matter in which death, thrusting aside
at last our two enemies, time and space, will
soon permit us to take part. Each world
dissolving, extinguished, crumbling, burnt
or colliding with another world and pulverized
means the commencement of a magnificent
experiment, the dawn of a marvellous
hope and perhaps an unexpected happiness
drawn direct from the inexhaustible unknown.
What though they freeze or flame,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>collect or disperse, pursue or flee one
another: mind and matter, no longer
united by the same pitiful hazard that joined
them in us, must rejoice at all that happens;
for all is but birth and rebirth, a departure
into an unknown filled with wonderful
promises and maybe an anticipation of some
ineffable event.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />CONCLUSIONS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>1</h3>

<p class='c008'>In order to retain a livelier image of all
this and a more exact memory, let us give
a last glance at the road which we have
travelled. We have put aside, for reasons
which we have stated, the religious solutions
and total annihilation. Annihilation is physically
impossible; the religious solutions
occupy a citadel without doors or windows
into which human reason does not penetrate.
Next comes the hypothesis of the survival of
our ego, released from its body, but retaining
a full and unimpaired consciousness of its
identity. We have seen that this hypothesis,
strictly defined, has very little likelihood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>is not greatly to be desired, although, with
the surrender of the body, the source of all
our ills, it seems less to be feared than our
actual existence. On the other hand, as
soon as we try to extend or to exalt it, so
that it may appear less barbarous or less crude,
we come back to the hypothesis of a cosmic
consciousness or of a modified consciousness,
which, together with that of survival without
any sort of consciousness, closes the field to
every supposition and exhausts every forecast
of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>Survival without any sort of consciousness
would be tantamount for us to annihilation
pure and simple and consequently would be
no more dreadful than the latter, that is to
say, than a sleep with no dreams and with
no awakening. The hypothesis is unquestionably
more acceptable than that of annihilation;
but it prejudges very rashly the
questions of a cosmic consciousness and of a
modified consciousness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>
<h3 class='c007'>2</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before replying to these, we must choose
our universe, for we have the choice. It is a
matter of knowing how we propose to look
at infinity. Is it the moveless, immovable
infinity, from all eternity perfect and at its
zenith, and the purposeless universe that our
reason will conceive at the farthest point of
our thoughts? Do we believe that, at our
death, the illusion of movement and progress
which we see from the depths of this
life will suddenly fade away? If so, it is
inevitable that, at our last breath, we shall
be absorbed in what, for lack of a better term,
we call the cosmic consciousness. Are we,
on the other hand, persuaded that death will
reveal to us that the illusion lies not in our
senses, but in our reason and that, in a world
incontestably alive, despite the eternity preceding
our birth, all the experiments have
not been made, that is to say that movement
and evolution continue and will never and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>nowhere stop? In that case, we must at
once accept the hypothesis of a modified or
progressive consciousness. The two aspects,
after all, are equally unintelligible, but defensible;
and, although really irreconcilable,
they agree on one point, namely, that unending
pain and unredeemed misery are alike
excluded from them both for ever.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>3</h3>

<p class='c008'>The hypothesis of a modified consciousness
does not necessitate the loss of the tiny
consciousness acquired in our body; but it
makes it almost negligible, flings, drowns
and dissolves it in infinity. It is of course
impossible to support this hypothesis with
satisfactory proofs; but it is not easy to
shatter it like the others. Were it permissible
to speak of likeness to truth in this connexion,
when our only truth is that we do not see
the truth, it is the most likely of the interim
hypotheses and gives a magnificent opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>for the most plausible, the most varied and
the most alluring dreams. Will our ego, our
soul, our spirit, or whatever we call that
which will survive us in order to continue us as
we are, will it find again, on leaving the body,
the innumerable lives which it must have
lived since the thousands of years that had
no beginning? Will it continue to increase
by assimilating all that it meets in infinity
during the thousands of years that will have
no end? Will it linger for a time around
our earth, leading, in regions invisible to our
eyes, an ever higher and happier existence,
as the theosophists and spiritualists contend?
Will it move towards other planetary systems,
will it emigrate to other worlds whose existence
is not even suspected by our senses?
Everything seems permissible in this great
dream, save that which might arrest its
flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, so soon as it ventures too far
in the ultramondane spaces, it crashes into
strange obstacles and breaks its wings against
them. If we admit that our ego does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>remain eternally what it was at the moment
of our death, we can no longer imagine that,
at a given second, it stops, ceases to expand
and rise, attains its perfection and its fulness,
to become no more than a sort of motionless
wreck suspended in eternity and a finished
thing in the midst of that which will never
finish. That would indeed be the only real
death and the more fearful inasmuch as it
would set a limit to an unparalleled life and
intelligence, beside which those which we
possess here below would not even weigh
what a drop of water weighs when compared
with the ocean, or a grain of sand when
placed in the scales with a mountain-chain.
In a word, either we believe that our evolution
will one day stop, implying thereby
an incomprehensible end and a sort of inconceivable
death; or we admit that it
has no limit, whereupon, being infinite, it
assumes all the properties of infinity and
must needs be lost in infinity and united with
it. This, withal, is the latter end of theosophy,
spiritualism and all the religions in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>which man, in his ultimate happiness, is
absorbed by God. And this again is an
incomprehensible end, but at least it is life.
And then, taking one incomprehensibility
with another, after doing all that is humanly
possible to understand one or the other
riddle, let us by preference leap into the
greatest and therefore the most probable,
the one which contains all the others and
after which nothing more remains. If not,
the questions reappear at every stage and
the answers are always conflicting. And
questions and answers lead us to the same
inevitable abyss. As we shall have to face it
sooner or later, why not make for it straightway?
All that happens to us in the interval
interests us beyond a doubt, but does not
detain us, because it is not eternal.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>4</h3>

<p class='c008'>Behold us then before the mystery of
the cosmic consciousness. Although we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>incapable of understanding the act of an
infinity that would have to fold itself up in
order to feel itself and consequently to define
itself and separate itself from other things,
this is not an adequate reason for declaring it
impossible; for, if we were to reject all the
realities and impossibilities that we do not
understand, there would be nothing left for
us to live upon. If this consciousness exist
under the form which we have conceived, it
is evident that we shall be there and take part
in it. If there be a consciousness somewhere,
or some thing that takes the place of consciousness,
we shall be in that consciousness or
that thing, because we cannot be elsewhere.
And, as this consciousness or this thing cannot
be unhappy, because it is impossible
that infinity should exist for its own
unhappiness, neither shall we be unhappy
when we are in it. Lastly, if the infinity
into which we shall be projected have
no sort of consciousness nor anything that
stands for it, the reason will be that
consciousness or anything that might replace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>it is not indispensable to eternal
happiness.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>5</h3>

<p class='c008'>That, I think, is about as much as we may
be permitted to declare, for the moment, to
the spirit anxiously facing the unfathomable
space wherein death will shortly hurl it. It
can still hope to find there the fulfilment of
its dreams; it will perhaps find less to dread
than it had feared. If it prefer to remain
expectant and to accept none of the hypotheses
which I have expounded to the best
of my power and without prejudice, it nevertheless
seems difficult not to welcome, at
least, this great assurance which we find at
the bottom of every one of them, namely,
that infinity could not be malevolent, seeing
that, if it eternally tortured the least among
us, it would be torturing something which it
cannot tear out of itself and that it would
therefore be torturing its very self.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have added nothing to what was already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>known. I have simply tried to separate
what may be true from that which is assuredly
not true; for, if we do not know where truth
is, we nevertheless learn to know where it is
not. And, perhaps, in seeking for that undiscoverable
truth, we shall have accustomed
our eyes to pierce the terror of the last hour
by looking it full in the face. Many things,
beyond a doubt, remain to be said which
others will say with greater force and
brilliancy. But we need have no hope that
any one will utter on this earth the word
that shall put an end to our uncertainties.
It is very probable, on the contrary, that no
one in this world, nor perhaps in the next,
will discover the great secret of the universe.
And, if we reflect upon this even for a
moment, it is most fortunate that it should
be so. We have not only to resign ourselves
to living in the incomprehensible, but to
rejoice that we cannot go out of it. If there
were no more insoluble questions nor impenetrable
riddles, infinity would not be
infinite; and then we should have for ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to curse the fate that placed us in a universe
proportionate to our intelligence. All that
exists would be but a gateless prison, an
irreparable evil and mistake. The unknown
and the unknowable are necessary and will
perhaps always be necessary to our happiness.
In any case, I would not wish my worst
enemy, were his understanding a thousandfold
loftier and a thousandfold mightier
than mine, to be condemned eternally to
inhabit a world of which he had surprised an
essential secret and of which, as a man, he had
begun to grasp the least tittle.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.  To learn the precise truth about the neotheosophical
movement and its first manifestations, the reader should
study the striking report drawn up, after an impartial,
but strict enquiry, by Dr. Hodgson, who was sent to India
for this special purpose by the Society for Psychical
Research. In it he unveils, in a masterly fashion, the
obvious and often clumsy impositions of the famous
Mme. Blavatsky and the whole neotheosophical organization
(<i>Proceedings</i>, Vol. III, pp. 201-400: <i>Hodgson’s
Report on Phenomena connected with Theosophy</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. How strict these investigations are is shown by the
perpetual attacks on the S.P.R. in the spiritualistic press,
which constantly refers to it as the Society “for the
suppression of facts,” “for the wholesale imputation of
imposture,” “for the discouragement of the sensitive and
for the repudiation of every revelation of the kind which
was said to be pressing itself upon humanity from the
regions of light and knowledge.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. It would, however, be unjust to assert that all these
apparitions are open to question. For instance, it is
impossible to deny the reality of the celebrated Katie
King, the double of Florence Cook, whose actions and
movements were rigorously investigated and controlled
by a man like Sir William Crookes for a period of three
years. But, looked upon as a proof of survival—notwithstanding
that Katie King professed to be a dead
person who had returned to earth to expiate certain sins—her
manifestations are not so valuable as the communications
obtained since her time. In any case, they bring
us no revelation concerning existence beyond the grave;
and Katie, who was so young, so much alive, whose
pulsations could be counted, whose heart was heard beating,
who was photographed, who distributed locks of her
hair to those present, who replied to every question put
to her, Katie herself never uttered a word on the subject
of the secrets of the next world.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Those who take up the study of these supernormal
manifestations usually ask themselves:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why mediums? Why make use of these often
questionable and always inadequate intermediaries?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The reason is that, hitherto, no way has been discovered
of doing without them. If we admit the spiritualistic
theory, the discarnate spirits which surround us on
every side and which are separated from us by the impenetrable
and mysterious wall of death seek, in order
to communicate with us, the line of least resistance
between the two worlds and find it in the medium, without
our knowing why, even as we do not know why an electric
current passes along copper wire and is stopped by glass
or porcelain. If, on the other hand, we admit the telepathic
hypothesis, which is the more probable, we observe
that the thoughts, intentions or suggestions transmitted
are, in the majority of cases, not conveyed from one subconscious
intelligence to another. There is need of an
organism that is, at the same time, a receiver and a transmitter;
and this organism is found in the medium.
Why? Once more, we know absolutely nothing about it,
even as we do not know why one body or combination of
bodies is sensitive to concentric waves in wireless telegraphy,
while another is not affected by it. We here
grope, as, for that matter, we grope almost everywhere,
in the obscure domain of undisputed, but inexplicable
facts. Those who care to possess more precise notions
on the theory of mediumism will do well to read
the admirable address delivered by Sir William Crookes,
as president of the S.P.R., on the 29th of January
1897.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. These questions of fraud and imposture are naturally
the first that suggest themselves when we begin to study
these phenomena. But the slightest acquaintance with
the life, habits and proceedings of the three or four great
mediums of whom we are going to speak is enough to
remove even the faintest shadow of suspicion. Of all
the explanations conceivable, that one which attributes
everything to imposture and trickery is unquestionably
the most extraordinary and the least probable. Moreover,
by reading Richard Hodgson’s report entitled,
<i>Observations of certain Phenomena of Trance</i> (<i>Proceedings</i>,
Vols. VIII. and XIII.; and also J. H. Hyslop’s
report, Vol. XVI.), we can observe the precautions taken,
even to the extent of employing special detectives, to
make certain that Mrs. Piper, for instance, was unable,
normally and humanly speaking, to have any knowledge
of the facts which she revealed. I repeat, from the
moment that one enters upon this study, all suspicions
are dispelled without leaving a trace behind them; and we
are soon convinced that the key to the riddle must not be
sought in imposture. All the manifestations of the dumb,
mysterious and oppressed personality that lies concealed
in every one of us have to undergo the same ordeal in
their turn; and those which relate to the divining-rod,
to name no others, are at this moment passing through
the same crisis of incredulity. Less than fifty years ago,
the majority of the hypnotic phenomena which are now
scientifically classified were likewise looked upon as
fraudulent. It seems that man is loth to admit that there
lie within him many more things than he imagined.</p>

us too far from our subject, see Mr. J. G. Piddington’s
paper, <i>Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson’s Trance</i> (<i>Proceedings</i>,

A. C. Pigou’s article in Vol. XXIII (pp. 286 <i>et seq.</i>), which

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. In this connexion, however, we find two or three
rather perturbing facts, a remarkable one being, at a
spiritualistic meeting held by the late W. T. Stead, the
prediction of the murder of King Alexander and Queen
Draga, described with the most circumstantial details.
A verbatim report of this prediction was drawn up and
signed by some thirty witnesses; and Stead went next
day to beg the Servian minister in London to warn the
king of the danger that threatened him. The event
took place, as announced, a few months later. But
“precognition” does not necessarily require the intervention
of the dead; moreover, every case of this kind,
before being definitely accepted, would call for prolonged
investigation in every particular.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. To exhaust this question of survival and of communications
with the dead, I ought to speak of Dr.
Hyslop’s recent investigations, made with the assistance
of the mediums Smead and Chenoweth (communications
with William James). I ought also to mention Julia’s
famous “bureau” and, above all, the extraordinary
sittings of Mrs. Wriedt, the trumpet medium, who not
only obtains communications in which the dead speak
languages of which she herself is completely ignorant,
but raises apparitions said to be extremely disturbing. I
ought, lastly, to examine the facts set forth by Professor
Porro, Dr. Venzano and M. Rozanne and many other
things besides, for spiritualistic investigation and literature
are already piling volume upon volume. But it was not
my intention nor my pretension to make a complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>study of scientific spiritualism. I wished merely to omit
no essential point and to give a general, but accurate idea
of this posthumous atmosphere which no really new and
decisive fact has come to unsettle since the manifestations
of which we have spoken.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. In order to hide nothing and to bring all the documents
into court, we may point out that Colonel de Rochas
ascertained upon enquiry that the subjects’ revelations
concerning their former existences were inaccurate in
several particulars:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Their narratives were also full of anachronisms which
disclosed the presence of normal recollections among the
suggestions that came from an unknown source. Nevertheless,
one perfectly indubitable fact remains, which is
that of the existence of certain visions recurring with the
same characteristics in the case of a considerable number
of persons unknown to one another.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. In this connexion may I be permitted to quote a
personal experience? One evening, at the Abbaye de
Saint-Wandrille, where I am wont to spend my summers,
some newly-arrived guests were amusing themselves by
making a small table spin on its foot. I was quietly
smoking in a corner of the drawing-room, at some distance
from the little table, taking no interest in what was
happening around it and thinking of something quite
different. After due entreaty, the table replied that it
held the spirit of a seventeenth-century monk, who was
buried in the east gallery of the cloisters, under a flagstone
dated 1693. After the departure of the monk, who
suddenly, for no apparent reason, refused to continue
the interview, we thought that we would go, with a lamp,
and look for the grave. We ended by discovering, in
the far cloister on the eastern side, a tombstone in very
bad condition, broken, worn down, trodden into the ground
and crumbling, on which, by examining it very closely,
we were able, with great difficulty, to decipher the inscription,
“<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1693.” Now, at the moment of the monk’s
reply, there was no one in the drawing-room except my
guests and myself. None of them knew the abbey;
they had arrived that very evening, a few minutes before
dinner, after which, as it was quite dark, they had put off
their visit to the cloisters and the ruins until the following
day. Therefore, short of a belief in the “shells” or the
“elementals” of the theosophists, the revelation could
only have come from me. Nevertheless, I believed myself
to be absolutely ignorant of the existence of that particular
tombstone, one of the least legible among a score of
others, all belonging to the seventeenth century, which
pave this part of the cloisters.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
