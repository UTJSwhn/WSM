<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HIRTY odd years have come and gone since the curious <i>litterateurs</i> of
Paris were excited and charmed by the apparition of Frédéric Mistral’s
“Mirèio.” A pastoral poem in twelve cantos, composed in the dialect of
the <i>Bouches du Rhône</i>, and first issued by an obscure bookseller at
Avignon, it was produced before the great literary world with a parallel
French version of the author’s own, very singular and rather <i>sauvage</i>
as French, but exceedingly bold, picturesque, and poetic, and the poem
had the further advantage of a most eloquent and sympathetic
introduction in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, of September 15, 1859, by
Saint-René Taillandier.</p>

<p>The employment of a rustic southern dialect for the purposes of poetic
narrative was by no means so unheard-of a thing, even to the men of that
generation, as was indirectly assumed by the first reviewer of “Mirèio.”
Had not Jacques Jasmin, the immortal barber of Agen, written, in his own
local <i>patois</i>, “Françonette,” and “The Blind Girl of Castel Cuillé,”
and the inimitable “Papillotes”? But the work of Mistral, along with
that of the school which he claimed to represent, and of which he was
easily chief, was heralded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>{8}</span> certain <i>fanfare</i>&mdash;it came with a
specific and impressive claim of ancient Provençal traditions to be
revived, and a vast future inaugurated: pretensions which would have
seemed almost droll to the Gascon Jasmin, with his exquisite humour and
his adorable simplicity.</p>

<p>I can do no more than glance in this place at the history of the
self-styled Provençal Revival, the most ambitious and by far the most
romantic literary adventure of our day. It is an inviting subject, and
will one day form an interesting chapter in the long annals of poesy;
but the time is not yet fully come for estimating its results, and still
less, with its greatest champion yet living, for writing its obituary.</p>

<p>Joseph Roumanille, a schoolmaster of St. Remy, near Tarascon, was the
father of the movement. He first wrote poems in modern Provençal, so the
pleasant legend says, because his old mother could not understand him
when he essayed to read her those which he had written in French.
Delighted, and, as it would seem, a little amazed at his own success, he
came forward as the rightful heir to the long-lapsed inheritance of the
Troubadours, assumed that the language, whose literary capacities he had
re-discovered, was essentially the same as theirs, and contrived
thoroughly to imbue with his own faith in its future a band of clever
and ardent pupils, among whom, by the will of Heaven, there was one rare
genius&mdash;Frédéric Mistral, and one wild enthusiast, who was, at the same
time, an affluent and pathetic versifier&mdash;Théodore Aubanel. Animated by
a mystical assurance, hardly less profound than that of Loyola and his
companions upon Montmartre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>{9}</span> these knights of song bound themselves by a
sort of vow, to write in the effete language of the French Academy no
more. They constituted themselves a poetic order, and proceeded to adopt
an elaborate and somewhat fantastic organization. The almost religious
earnestness which animated them may be judged by the fact that when one
of the original band, Eugène Garcin&mdash;formally saluted by name, along
with some half-dozen others, in the sixth canto of “Mirèio”&mdash;cooled in
his ardour a little, and attempted to point out the factitious and
impracticable side of the movement, he was solemnly denounced by Mistral
as “the Judas of our little church.” It was a defection of no serious
moment, and the revival went its fervid way without Garcin.</p>

<p>The Provençal poets agreed to call themselves <i>felibre</i>, nobody knows to
this day exactly why. There are those who say that the word means <i>homme
de foi libre</i>, that is, emancipated from all slavish literary
tradition&mdash;as Mistral and his first associates undoubtedly were; there
are sticklers for antiquity and a direct descent from the Latin, who
maintain the derivation <i>qui facit libros</i>. Howbeit the <i>felibre</i> began
to publish at Avignon in the speech of the district, a periodical, which
still, I think, appears at irregular intervals. They constructed a small
grammar on the lines of the existing grammars of the ancient “Langue
d’oc,” especially of Raynouard’s “Résumé de la Grammaire Romaine,” and
they began the compilation of an extensive dictionary, which has never
even approached completion. They also revived the institution of an
annual poetic tournament with floral prizes&mdash;a silver lily, a golden
violet&mdash;where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span> native bards recited their verses, and received their
rewards, after the supposed manner of the olden time. These jousts were
usually held in the late summer or the early autumn. There were others
appointed for the yet more appropriate month of May, which received the
name of the feast of the <i>Santo Estello</i>, or Holy Star,&mdash;<i>memourativo de
la reneissenço dou Gai-Sabe</i>&mdash;to commemorate the renascence of the Gay
Science. Once in seven years this feast was to be celebrated with
extraordinary splendour, “in honour” (I continue to quote from the
address of Mistral at the Floral Games held at Hyères in 1885) “of the
seven rays of that mysterious star which leads, whithersoever God will,
our bark with its orange-freight.” That is to say, which determines,
after the manner of the Star of Bethlehem, the place where our society
shall assemble and listen to the pieces entered for competition.</p>

<p>Were it possible for a new language to be created, or a decaying one
revived, of determinate purpose, by native genius, fiery enthusiasm and
unstinted devotion to the cause, that miracle would surely have been
wrought by the <i>felibre</i> of the <i>Bouches du Rhône</i>. But the triumph of a
language, like that of the kingdom of heaven, is among the things which
do not come by observation. It is determined by causes as vast as those
which shape the continents, and quite as independent of the theories of
individual men. The order of the Holy Star, was after all only a kind of
idealized mutual admiration society, and of all its members during a
full quarter of a century, three names only have advanced from local
renown to anything like general recognition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span> They are the three names
already cited of Roumanille, Aubanel, and Mistral.</p>

<p>The two former have already passed away, leaving behind them many
charming lyrics, but no work of universal and lasting interest. Mistral
is gloriously young at sixty, able, and let us hope willing, to give us
in that rich and flowing idiom, which no one else has ever managed with
such mastery as he, many more historical and narrative poems, vivid with
local colour, and teeming with local tradition, like “Calendau”&mdash;a
romance of the last century, which appeared in 1873 and “Nerto”&mdash;a tale
of the time of the Popes at Avignon, published in 1884. But it is safe
to prophesy that neither Mistral nor any other <i>felibre</i> will ever give
us another “Mirèio”&mdash;so spontaneous, artless, and impassioned, so dewy
with the memories of the poet’s own childhood on a Provençal farm, or
<i>mas</i>, so gay with the laughter and moving with the tears of simple
folk, reflecting in so flawless a mirror every change of the seasons,
every aspect of the free, primitive, bucolic life of the Mediterranean
shore.</p>

<p>The success of Aubanel was perhaps frustrated by the very extravagance
of his own aims. When we find him at the <i>fêtes</i> of Forcalquier in 1875
apostrophizing the arbiters of literary renown in France in terms like
these: “Sachez que nous sommes un grand peuple, et qu’il n’est plus
temps de nous mépriser. Trente départements parlent notre langue, d’une
mer à l’autre mer, des Pyrénées jusqu’aux Alpes, de Crau à Limousin; le
même amour fait battre notre poitrine, l’amour de la terre natale et de
la langue maternelle.... Sachez que vous serez tombés longtemps alors<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span>
que le Provençal, toujours jeune, parlera encore de vous avec pitié”&mdash;we
can then understand that Saint-René Tallandier, the original sponsor of
Mirèio, should have made haste to express his grave apprehensions for
the sanity of the revivalist movement, and to repudiate in the name of
the great Review all countenance of so vast a pretension on behalf of an
“idiom which had vanished for six hundred years from the battlefield of
ideas.”</p>

<p>One is reminded of the lament of the late William Barnes that the
dialect of Dorset had not prevailed in England over the tongue of
Shakespeare. Yet William Barnes, like the <i>felibre</i>, wrote poems in the
local <i>patois</i>, far more beautiful and pathetic than any which he ever
produced in proper English.</p>

<p>Mistral himself, with the profounder instincts and wiser judgment of a
really large mind, has grown more modest from year to year in his hopes
concerning the final harvest of that generous enterprise to which his
life and powers have been consecrated. He was not quite able to extend a
hearty welcome to Alphonse Daudet, when that most humane and sympathetic
of realists appeared upon the scene with “Numa Roumestan” and the
“Lettres de mon Moulin,” describing in the most pellucid French and with
a fidelity equal to his own, the prose aspect of the life of the South,
and all the rustic scenes which Mistral had so affectionately poetized.
All the <i>felibre</i>, indeed, looked askance at Daudet as an intruder, and
this is one more sign, if not of the limitations of their leader’s
genius, at least of the narrow and ephemeral character of their
collective ideal. However, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span> address delivered before the
previously-mentioned assembly at Hyères in 1885&mdash;ten years after Aubanel
had hurled his fierce defiance at the French Academy&mdash;Mistral might have
been heard pleading, with much earnestness and good sense, that French
and Provençal should be kept resolutely distinct, both in the teaching
of the schools, and in the talk of the people, and that, by way of
preserving the purity of <i>both forms of speech</i>.</p>

<p>His remarks had an especial appropriateness then and there, because the
prose work crowned upon that occasion was a series of naïve and highly
dramatic dialogues, entitled “Scènes de la Vie Provençale,” by M. C.
Sénès, of Toulon, officially known as La Sinse. French of the most
barbaric, and Provençal of the most pliant, are mixed up in these
delightfully comic dialogues exactly as they are upon the lips of the
common folk. It is the most amusing, perhaps the only distinctly amusing
work which the school of the <i>felibre</i> has ever produced, and anybody
who reads French may read and have a hearty laugh over it. And I may
add, from my own experience, that a very short residence in the ancient
Provincia is enough to show that the local idiom is much more
intelligible phonetically than it looks at first sight upon paper.</p>

<p>I may be mistaken, but I take the truth to be that modern Provençal is,
after all, a dialect only, and not, as was so long and passionately
claimed by the confederate poets, a language. As a matter of fact, it
resembles the plastic idiom of the ancient Troubadours very little more
than it resembles modern French, and certainly no more than it resembles
Gascon, Catalan, or the Italian of the Western Riviera. All the Romance
dialects, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span>however fallen from literary honour, or untamed by literary
law, are closely akin, and bear marks, even in their utmost degradation,
of the same illustrious pedigree. They are like certain wild flowers,
the pimpernel, the anemone, whose species can never be mistaken, but
whose colours present, and that spontaneously, an almost infinite
variety.</p>

<p>The poem of “Mirèio,” in parallel French and Provençal, first fell in my
way in the summer of 1871; and I admire my own audacity in immediately
attempting to turn it into English verse,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> almost as much as I do that
of the men who first preached the Provençal crusade against the language
of Racine and Molière. Of course I knew no more of the idiom in which it
was originally composed than could be gathered from a close comparison
of the same with Mistral’s own French, aided by a smattering of old
Provençal. I may plead in extenuation of my effrontery that there was
virtually no more to be known at that time, for even the grammar already
mentioned had not then been published. There is not very much more to be
known even now.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Boston, U.S.A., Roberts Bros., 1872.</p></div>

<p>The scheme of the Provençal verse, though elaborate, and seemingly very
artificial, was easily enough intelligible to an English ear; more so, I
should fancy, than to a Parisian one, on account of its obvious
<i>jingle</i>&mdash;or, to speak by the book, the exuberance of its rhymes, and
the strength of its tonic accents. The same remark, as is well known,
applies in a general way to the songs of the Troubadours. Mistral’s
stanza consists of five eight-syllabled iambic lines with feminine
rhymes, in groups of two and three, and two twelve-syllabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span> iambic
lines, with masculine rhymes. The Quaker poet Whittier had fallen upon a
somewhat similar verse, in one of the finest of his earlier
poems&mdash;“Lines written at Hampton Beach”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“So when Time’s veil shall fall asunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The soul may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sudden change, no curious wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sink the weight of mystery under,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But with the upward rise, and with the vastness grow.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But this is far simpler than Mistral’s.</p>

<p>I did actually make an attempt to transfer this florid measure to our
own sober English tongue, and that eminent American poet and very
distinguished connoisseur in poetic metres, the late Mr. Longfellow,
once told me that he greatly wished I had persevered, and that he
thought it would have been quite possible to render the whole poem in
the same way. Perhaps it would have been, to a master of versification,
like himself; and for his sake, and out of respect for his opinion, I
subjoin the opening stanzas of the poem in Provençal, and my own attempt
to imitate their metre, premising, for the benefit of the unskilled,
that in Provençal every letter sounds, the vowels as in French, while of
the consonants <i>g</i> and <i>j</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> are pronounced like <i>ds</i>,
and <i>ch</i> always like <i>ts</i>. A final vowel is elided, in scanning, before
another vowel; and the tonic accent is strongly marked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>To me the thought of keeping this up for twelve cantos was simply
appalling. Even in my trial stanzas, as will be seen, I had sacrificed
many of the feminine rhymes; and I am now inclined to think, though I
speak under correction, that Mistral himself and his followers availed
themselves pretty liberally of the license which the classic Troubadours
are well known to have employed, of manipulating their final syllables
more or less in order to make them rhyme.</p>

<p>The measure finally adopted&mdash;ten-syllabled iambic lines with consecutive
rhymes, usually masculine but sometimes feminine&mdash;was essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>{17}</span> the
same as that employed by William Morris in the “Earthly Paradise.” That
beautiful work was then new, and very popular in America, and it seemed,
and I own that to me it seems still, to present almost the ideal of
English narrative poetry. But I broke my version into stanzas of six
lines, by way, I suppose, of making it look more like the original.</p>

<p>In those comparatively early days, I also held, and rather doated on, a
theory of my own about what are called imperfect rhymes. I was persuaded
that rhymes where the consonant sounds correspond while the vowel sounds
merely approximate&mdash;like <i>wreck</i> and <i>make</i>, <i>gone</i> and <i>son</i>&mdash;are the
counterpart on the one hand of assonances upon the other, in which the
vowels correspond but not the consonants; that their relation to perfect
rhymes is exactly that of minor to major harmonies, and that they
relieve the ear in a long-rhymed poem, no less than the latter in a
musical composition. Though very naturally censured for the freedom with
which I exercised this caprice in my version of “Mirèio,” I still clung
to it tenaciously as late as 1880, when I made a version of the Georgics
of Vergil. I am by no means certain even now that there is not sound
musical justification for the idea, but I have grown conservative with
years, as we are all apt to do, and I cherish an ever-increasing respect
for <i>law</i>&mdash;literary and other. In the present edition of my “Mirèio,” I
have therefore reformed and, so to speak, <i>ranged</i> some scores of these
licentious rhymes, aiming always, at the same time, at coming closer to
the meaning of the original, as I now understand it, even if need be, at
the sacrifice of some picturesqueness in the English line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>{18}</span></p>

<p>I had always beside me when I first made my version, the English prose
translation of “Mirèio,” by Mr. C. H. Grant, to which I feel myself to
have been not a little indebted. In artlessness of narrative, in vigour
and felicity of expression, I have never hoped to surpass this unrhymed
and unmeasured version, which needed, as it seemed to me, only a
rhythmic form to render it worthy of the essentially <i>musical</i> original.</p>

<p>A second English translation, by H. Crichton, with which I became
acquainted subsequently, had been published by Macmillan and Co.,
London, in 1868. This version was a metrical one, and fairly close, but
it failed, I think, in catching, not the music merely, but the rural
freshness and fragrance, the genuinely bucolic spirit of the Provençal.
It is because, I venture to hope, that my version, with all its faults,
does reflect something of all this, that a new edition of it is offered
to the public after so long a time.</p>

<span class="i0">Once, then, beside the poplar-bordered Rhone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lived a basket-weaver and his son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a poor hut set round with willow-trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For all their humble wares were made from these);<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so one evening, as they trudged their round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With osier bundles on their shoulders bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Father,” young Vincen said, “the clouds look wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About old Magalouno’s tower up-piled.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Nay, nay!” the old man said, “no rain to-night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis the sea-breeze that shakes the trees. All right!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A western gale were different.” Vincen mused:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Are many ploughs at Lotus farmstead used?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Six ploughs!” the basket-weaver answered slow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It is the finest freehold in La Crau.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Look! There’s their olive-orchard, intermixt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rows of vines and almond-trees betwixt.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Nay: for ’tis almost Hallowmas, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the girls come flocking in from Baux,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sheets and sacks, and call it only fun.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun was sinking, as old Ambroi said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On high were little clouds a-flush with red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sideways upon their yokèd cattle rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labourers slowly home, each with his goad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect. Night darkened on the distant moor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas supper-time, the day of toil was o’er.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And here we are!” the boy cried. “I can see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The straw-heaped threshing-floor, so hasten we!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But stay!” the other. “Now, as I’m alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lotus Farm’s the place for sheep to thrive,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pine-woods all the summer, and the sweep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yon lotus-grove a hundred swarms will gather.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And one thing more” cried Vincen, eagerly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The very best of all, it seems to me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean the maiden, father, who dwells here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not have forgotten how, last year,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So saying, they drew the farm-house door a-nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the dewy twilight, saw thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid herself. Distaff in hand she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching her silk-worms at their leafy food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then master Ambroi let his osiers fall,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Father, the same to you!” the damsel said.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Valabrègo?” Ambroi answered, “Yea.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whereat, with no more words, father and son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by upon a roller sat them down,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A half-made cradle chanced the same to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast through the nimble fingers of the two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The supple osier bent and crossed and flew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Certes, our Vincen was a comely lad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright face and a manly form he had,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Full well he knew the osier to prepare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wherewith the farmers use their beasts to lade,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And likewise brooms of millet-grass, and such,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And found a ready sale the farms among.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The labourers were trooping home at last.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mirèio leaned with her cheeks rosy red.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now, while the white hen gave three piercing crows,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Vincen received it, and, with fingers lithe<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of wind was the Rhone’s bosom agitated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves drove seaward like a herd belated;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And beavers gnawed their bitter bark in peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While yonder, through the deep of limpid water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darted at intervals the dark brown otter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following the silver-flashing fish. Among<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While others pluck the purple clusters rather?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lifting his hands, the old man sternly said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then to the rough stream Vincen fled away;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“For where I served the master had a daughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had a labourer, too, who loved and sought her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as our Vincen loves Mirèio.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was named Alis; he, Sivèstre: and so<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One morning master’s wife, as it befell,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So when at dinner all the men were sitting,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘Traitor!’ he cried, with his eyes all aglow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘You are discovered! Take your wage, and go!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We looked at one another in dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the good servant rose, and went his way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thereafter, for three weeks, when we were working,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And his face very pale and wild and worn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Ambroi, in gruff tones half-audible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A little child a little trouble gives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more and more for every year he lives.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His hobnailed shoes, and long red cap, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway set forth upon the road to Crau.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas harvest-time, the eve of St. John’s day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hedgerow paths were crowded all the way<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With troops of dusty, sunburnt mountaineers<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In fig-wood quivers were their sickles borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slung to a belt across the shoulder worn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By twos and twos they came, and every pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had its own sheaf-binder. And carts were there,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bearing the weary elders, and beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pipes and tambourines with ribbons tied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon by fields of beardless wheat they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashed into billows by the noisy blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And “Mon Dieu, but that is noble grain!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cried. “What tufts of ears! There shall we gain<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Right pleasant reaping! The wind bows them over;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But see you not how quickly they recover?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all the wheat-crop of Provence thus cheering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandfather?” asked a youth, old Ambroi nearing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The red is backward still,” he made reply;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Now, grandfather, may the good God thee hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy granary the same fulfil!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Ambroi and the reapers chatted still<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In friendly wise, under the willows wending;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these as well to Lotus Farm were tending.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It also chanced that Master Ramoun went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That eve to hearken for the wheat’s complaint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the wind, wild waster of the grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as he strode over the yellow plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From north to south, he heard the golden corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring, “See the ills that we have borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master, from this great gale. It spills our seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blurs our bloom!”&mdash;“Put on your gloves of reed,”<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When will the sickles come?” And Ramoun turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the trees, and even then discerned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reapers rising in the distance dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as they nearer drew, saluted him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waving sickles flashing in the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then roared the master, “Welcome, every one!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A very God-send!” cried he, loud and long;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What heaps of sheaves, good master, will this year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cumber your treading-floor!”&mdash;“Mayhap,” said he:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Till all is trod, the truth will not be known.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Eighty full bushels to the acre fairly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yielded in their stead a dozen barely.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He shook their hands all round in friendly style,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And gossiped with old Ambroi affably.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So entered all the homestead path, and he<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Prepare the chiccory and draw the wine!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she right lavishly the table spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Ramoun first him seated at its head,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Good-by! good-by! We are drifting out to sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves encompass us, and needs must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very avenue to Paradise,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Gently they rock us now. And overhead<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, by her smiling lips, you might have guessed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“See you not she is dead?” he loudly wailed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quite dead?” And therewith fiercely wrung his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he of old had wrung the osier-strands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He cried, “they will not weep for you alone:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tears rushed like rain, and sobs would not be stilled.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
