A table in front of steps at one side, with food
on it, and a bench by table. <span class="smcap">Seanchan</span> lying

    <div class="stanza">
<div class="speakerc">KING.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">I welcome</span> you that have the mastery</div>
<div class="verse">Of the two kinds of Music: the one kind</div>
<div class="verse">Being like a woman, the other like a man.</div>
<div class="verse">Both you that understand stringed instruments,</div>
<div class="verse">And how to mingle words and notes together</div>
<div class="verse">So artfully, that all the Art’s but Speech</div>
<div class="verse">Delighted with its own music; and you that carry</div>
<div class="verse">The long twisted horn, and understand</div>
<div class="verse">The heady notes that, being without words,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Can hurry beyond Time and Fate and Change.</div>
<div class="verse">For the high angels that drive the horse of Time—</div>
<div class="verse">The golden one by day, by night the silver—</div>
<div class="verse">Are not more welcome to one that loves the world</div>
<div class="verse">For some fair woman’s sake.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">I have called you hither</span></div>
<div class="verse">To save the life of your great master, Seanchan,</div>
<div class="verse">For all day long it has flamed up or flickered</div>
<div class="verse">To the fast cooling hearth.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 11em;">When did he sicken?</span></div>
<div class="verse">Is it a fever that is wasting him?</div>
<div class="speakerc">KING.</div>
<div class="verse">No fever or sickness. He has chosen death:</div>
<div class="verse">Refusing to eat or drink, that he may bring</div>
<div class="verse">Disgrace upon me; for there is a custom,</div>
<div class="verse">An old and foolish custom, that if a man</div>
<div class="verse">Be wronged, or think that he is wronged, and starve</div>
<div class="verse">Upon another’s threshold till he die,</div>
<div class="verse">The common people, for all time to come,</div>
<div class="verse">Will raise a heavy cry against that threshold,</div>
<div class="verse">Even though it be the King’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">My head whirls round;</span></div>
<div class="verse">I do not know what I am to think or say.</div>
<div class="verse">I owe you all obedience, and yet</div>
<div class="verse">How can I give it, when the man I have loved</div>
<div class="verse">More than all others, thinks that he is wronged</div>
<div class="verse">So bitterly, that he will starve and die</div>
<div class="verse">Rather than bear it? Is there any man</div>
<div class="verse">Will throw his life away for a light issue?</div>
<div class="speakerc">KING.</div>
<div class="verse">It is but fitting that you take his side</div>
<div class="verse">Until you understand how light an issue</div>
<div class="verse">Has put us by the ears. Three days ago</div>
<div class="verse">I yielded to the outcry of my courtiers—</div>
<div class="verse">Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law—</div>
<div class="verse">Who long had thought it against their dignity</div>
<div class="verse">For a mere man of words to sit amongst them</div>
<div class="verse">At my own table. When the meal was spread,</div>
<div class="verse">I ordered Seanchan to a lower table;</div>
<div class="verse">And when he pleaded for the poets’ right,</div>
<div class="verse">Established at the establishment of the world,</div>
<div class="verse">I said that I was King, and that all rights</div>
<div class="verse">Had their original fountain in some king,</div>
<div class="verse">And that it was the men who ruled the world,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>And not the men who sang to it, who should sit</div>
<div class="verse">Where there was the most honour. My courtiers—</div>
<div class="verse">Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law—</div>
<div class="verse">Shouted approval; and amid that noise</div>
<div class="verse">Seanchan went out, and from that hour to this,</div>
<div class="verse">Although there is good food and drink beside him,</div>
<div class="verse">Has eaten nothing.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">I can breathe again.</span></div>
<div class="verse">You have taken a great burden from my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">For that old custom’s not worth dying for.</div>
<div class="speakerc">KING.</div>
<div class="verse">Persuade him to eat or drink. Till yesterday</div>
<div class="verse">I thought that hunger and weakness had been enough;</div>
<div class="verse">But finding them too trifling and too light</div>
<div class="verse">To hold his mouth from biting at the grave,</div>
<div class="verse">I called you hither, and all my hope’s in you,</div>
<div class="verse">And certain of his neighbours and good friends</div>
<div class="verse">That I have sent for. While he is lying there</div>
<div class="verse">Perishing, my good name in the world</div>
<div class="verse">Is perishing also. I cannot give way,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Because I am King. Because if I gave way,</div>
<div class="verse">My Nobles would call me a weakling, and it may be</div>
<div class="verse">The very throne be shaken.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 11em;">I will persuade him.</span></div>
<div class="verse">Your words had been enough persuasion, King;</div>
<div class="verse">But being lost in sleep or reverie,</div>
<div class="verse">He cannot hear them.</div>
<div class="speakerc">KING.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Make him eat or drink.</span></div>
<div class="verse">Nor is it all because of my good name</div>
<div class="verse">I’d have him do it, for he is a man</div>
<div class="verse">That might well hit the fancy of a king,</div>
<div class="verse">Banished out of his country, or a woman’s,</div>
<div class="verse">Or any other’s that can judge a man</div>
<div class="verse">For what he is. But I that sit a throne,</div>
<div class="verse">And take my measure from the needs of the State,</div>
<div class="verse">Call his wild thought that overruns the measure,</div>
<div class="verse">Making words more than deeds, and his proud will</div>
<div class="verse">That would unsettle all, most mischievous,</div>
<div class="verse">And he himself a most mischievous man.</div>
<div class="right">[<i>He turns to go, and then returns again.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Promise a house with grass and tillage land,</div>
<div class="verse">An annual payment, jewels and silken ware,</div>
<div class="verse">Or anything but that old right of the poets.</div>
<div class="right">[<i>He goes into palace.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse">The King did wrong to abrogate our right;</div>
<div class="verse">But Seanchan, who talks of dying for it,</div>
<div class="verse">Talks foolishly. Look at us, Seanchan;</div>
<div class="verse">Waken out of your dream and look at us,</div>
<div class="verse">Who have ridden under the moon and all the day,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the moon has all but come again,</div>
<div class="verse">That we might be beside you.</div>
<div class="speakerc">SEANCHAN.<br />
[<i>Half turning round, leaning on his elbow, and<br />
speaking as if in a dream.</i>]</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">I was but now</span></div>
<div class="verse">In Almhuin, in a great high-raftered house,</div>
<div class="verse">With Finn and Osgar. Odours of roast flesh</div>
<div class="verse">Rose round me, and I saw the roasting-spits;</div>
<div class="verse">And then the dream was broken, and I saw</div>
<div class="verse">Grania dividing salmon by a stream.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse">Hunger has made you dream of roasting flesh;</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>And though I all but weep to think of it,</div>
<div class="verse">The hunger of the crane, that starves himself</div>
<div class="verse">At the full moon because he is afraid</div>
<div class="verse">Of his own shadow and the glittering water,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems to me little more fantastical</div>
<div class="verse">Than this of yours.</div>
<div class="speakerc">SEANCHAN.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Why, that’s the very truth.</span></div>
<div class="verse">It is as though the moon changed everything—</div>
<div class="verse">Myself and all that I can hear and see;</div>
<div class="verse">For when the heavy body has grown weak,</div>
<div class="verse">There’s nothing that can tether the wild mind</div>
<div class="verse">That, being moonstruck and fantastical,</div>
<div class="verse">Goes where it fancies. I had even thought</div>
<div class="verse">I knew your voice and face, but now the words</div>
<div class="verse">Are so unlikely that I needs must ask</div>
<div class="verse">Who is it that bids me put my hunger by.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse">I am your oldest pupil, Seanchan;</div>
<div class="verse">The one that has been with you many years—</div>
<div class="verse">So many, that you said at Candlemas</div>
<div class="verse">That I had almost done with school, and knew</div>
<div class="verse">All but all that poets understand.</div>
<div class="speakerc">SEANCHAN.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>My oldest pupil? No, that cannot be,</div>
<div class="verse">For it is some one of the courtly crowds</div>
<div class="verse">That have been round about me from sunrise,</div>
<div class="verse">And I am tricked by dreams; but I’ll refute them.</div>
<div class="verse">At Candlemas I bid that pupil tell me</div>
<div class="verse">Why poetry is honoured, wishing to know</div>
<div class="verse">If he had any weighty argument</div>
<div class="verse">For distant countries and strange, churlish kings.</div>
<div class="verse">What did he answer?</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">I said the poets hung</span></div>
<div class="verse">Images of the life that was in Eden</div>
<div class="verse">About the child-bed of the world, that it,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking upon those images, might bear</div>
<div class="verse">Triumphant children. But why must I stand here,</div>
<div class="verse">Repeating an old lesson, while you starve?</div>
<div class="speakerc">SEANCHAN.</div>
<div class="verse">Tell on, for I begin to know the voice.</div>
<div class="verse">What evil thing will come upon the world</div>
<div class="verse">If the Arts perish?</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">If the Arts should perish,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>The world that lacked them would be like a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">That looking on the cloven lips of a hare,</div>
<div class="verse">Brings forth a hare-lipped child.</div>
<div class="speakerc">SEANCHAN.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 13em;">But that’s not all:</span></div>
<div class="verse">For when I asked you how a man should guard</div>
<div class="verse">Those images, you had an answer also,</div>
<div class="verse">If you’re the man that you have claimed to be,</div>
<div class="verse">Comparing them to venerable things</div>
<div class="verse">God gave to men before he gave them wheat.</div>
<div class="speakerc">OLDEST PUPIL.</div>
<div class="verse">I answered—and the word was half your own—</div>
<div class="verse">That he should guard them as the Men of Dea</div>
<div class="verse">Guard their four treasures, as the Grail King guards</div>
<div class="verse">His holy cup, or the pale, righteous horse</div>
<div class="verse">The jewel that is underneath his horn,</div>
<div class="verse">Pouring out life for it as one pours out</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet heady wine.... But now I understand;</div>
<div class="verse">You would refute me out of my own mouth;</div>
<div class="verse">And yet a place at table, near the King,</div>
<div class="verse">Is nothing of great moment, Seanchan.</div>
<div class="verse">How does so light a thing touch poetry?</div>

<h2>ON BAILE’S STRAND</h2>


<div class="hang1">

<i>A great hall at Dundealgan, not ‘Cuchulain’s great
ancient house’ but an assembly house nearer to
the sea. A big door at the back, and through
the door misty light as of sea mist. There are
many chairs and one long bench. One of these
chairs, which is towards the front of the stage,
is bigger than the others. Somewhere at the back
there is a table with flagons of ale upon it and
drinking-horns. There is a small door at one
side of the hall. A <span class="small">FOOL</span> and <span class="small">BLIND MAN</span>, both
ragged, come in through the door at the back.
The <span class="small">BLIND MAN</span> leans upon a staff.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a clever man you are though you are
blind! There’s nobody with two eyes in his
head that is as clever as you are. Who but
you could have thought that the henwife sleeps
every day a little at noon? I would never be
able to steal anything if you didn’t tell me where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to look for it. And what a good cook you are!
You take the fowl out of my hands after I have
stolen it and plucked it, and you put it into the
big pot at the fire there, and I can go out and
run races with the witches at the edge of the
waves and get an appetite, and when I’ve got
it, there’s the hen waiting inside for me, done
to the turn.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.<br />
[<i>Who is feeling about with his stick.</i>]</div>

<p>Done to the turn.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.<br />
[<i>Putting his arm round</i> <span class="smcap">Blind Man’s</span> <i>neck.</i>]</div>

<p>Come now, I’ll have a leg and you’ll have a
leg, and we’ll draw lots for the wish-bone. I’ll
be praising you, I’ll be praising you, while
we’re eating it, for your good plans and for
your good cooking. There’s nobody in the
world like you, Blind Man. Come, come. Wait
a minute. I shouldn’t have closed the door.
There are some that look for me, and I wouldn’t
like them not to find me. Don’t tell it to anybody,
Blind Man. There are some that follow
me. Boann herself out of the river and Fand
out of the deep sea. Witches they are, and
they come by in the wind, and they cry, ‘Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a kiss, Fool, give a kiss,’ that’s what they cry.
That’s wide enough. All the witches can come
in now. I wouldn’t have them beat at the
door and say: ‘Where is the Fool? Why has
he put a lock on the door?’ Maybe they’ll
hear the bubbling of the pot and come in and
sit on the ground. But we won’t give them
any of the fowl. Let them go back to the sea,
let them go back to the sea.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.<br />
[<i>Feeling legs of big chair with his hands.</i>]</div>

<p>Ah! [<i>Then, in a louder voice as he feels the
back of it.</i>] Ah—ah—</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Why do you say ‘Ah-ah’?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>I know the big chair. It is to-day the
High King Conchubar is coming. They have
brought out his chair. He is going to be
Cuchulain’s master in earnest from this day
out. It is that he’s coming for.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>He must be a great man to be Cuchulain’s
master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>So he is. He is a great man. He is over all
the rest of the kings of Ireland.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Cuchulain’s master! I thought Cuchulain
could do anything he liked.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>So he did, so he did. But he ran too wild,
and Conchubar is coming to-day to put an oath
upon him that will stop his rambling and make
him as biddable as a house-dog and keep him
always at his hand. He will sit in this chair
and put the oath upon him.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>How will he do that?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>You have no wits to understand such things.
[<i>The <span class="small">BLIND MAN</span> has got into the chair.</i>] He
will sit up in this chair and he’ll say: ‘Take
the oath, Cuchulain. I bid you take the oath.
Do as I tell you. What are your wits compared
with mine, and what are your riches
compared with mine? And what sons have
you to pay your debts and to put a stone over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you when you die? Take the oath, I tell you.
Take a strong oath.’</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.<br />
[<i>Crumpling himself up and whining.</i>]</div>

<p>I will not. I’ll take no oath. I want my
dinner.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Hush, hush! It is not done yet.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>You said it was done to a turn.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Did I, now? Well, it might be done, and
not done. The wings might be white, but the
legs might be red. The flesh might stick hard
to the bones and not come away in the teeth.
But, believe me, Fool, it will be well done before
you put your teeth in it.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>My teeth are growing long with the hunger.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>I’ll tell you a story—the kings have story-tellers
while they are waiting for their dinner—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will tell you a story with a fight in it, a
story with a champion in it, and a ship and a
queen’s son that has his mind set on killing
somebody that you and I know.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Who is that? Who is he coming to kill?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Wait, now, till you hear. When you were
stealing the fowl, I was lying in a hole in the
sand, and I heard three men coming with a
shuffling sort of noise. They were wounded
and groaning.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Go on. Tell me about the fight.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>There had been a fight, a great fight, a tremendous
great fight. A young man had landed
on the shore, the guardians of the shore had
asked his name, and he had refused to tell it,
and he had killed one, and others had run away.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>That’s enough. Come on now to the fowl.
I wish it was bigger. I wish it was as big as
a goose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Hush! I haven’t told you all. I know who
that young man is. I heard the men who were
running away say he had red hair, that he had
come from Aoife’s country, that he was coming
to kill Cuchulain.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Nobody can do that.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Hush, I say!</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Does Cuchulain know that he is coming to
kill him?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>How would he know that with his head in
the clouds? He doesn’t care for common fighting.
Why would he put himself out, and nobody
in it but that young man? Now, if it
were a white fawn that might turn into a
queen before morning—</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Come to the fowl. I wish it was as big as a
pig; a fowl with goose grease and pig’s crackling.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>No hurry, no hurry. I know whose son it
is. I wouldn’t tell anybody else, but I will tell
you,—a secret is better to you than your dinner.
You like being told secrets.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Tell me the secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>That young man is Aoife’s son. I am sure it
is Aoife’s son, it flows in upon me that it is
Aoife’s son. You have often heard me talking
of Aoife, the great woman-fighter Cuchulain
got the mastery over in the north?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>I know, I know. She is one of those cross
queens that live in hungry Scotland.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>I am sure it is her son. I was in Aoife’s
country for a long time.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>That was before you were blinded for putting
a curse upon the wind.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>There was a boy in her house that had her
own red colour on him and everybody said he
was to be brought up to kill Cuchulain, that
she hated Cuchulain. She used to put a helmet
on a pillar-stone and call it Cuchulain and set
him casting at it. There is a step outside—Cuchulain’s
step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">[<i><span class="small">CUCHULAIN</span> passes by in the mist outside the

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Where is Cuchulain going?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>He is going to meet Conchubar that has
bidden him to take the oath.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Ah, an oath, Blind Man. How can I remember
so many things at once? Who is going
to take an oath?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Cuchulain is going to take an oath to Conchubar
who is High King.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>What a mix-up you make of everything,
Blind Man. You were telling me one story,
and now you are telling me another story....
How can I get the hang of it at the end if
you mix everything at the beginning? Wait till
I settle it out. There now, there’s Cuchulain
[<i>he points to one foot</i>], and there is the young
man [<i>he points to the other foot</i>] that is coming
to kill him, and Cuchulain doesn’t know. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
where’s Conchubar? [<i>Takes bag from side.</i>]
That’s Conchubar with all his riches—Cuchulain,
young man, Conchubar—And where’s
Aoife? [<i>Throws up cap.</i>] There is Aoife, high
up on the mountains in high hungry Scotland.
Maybe it is not true after all. Maybe it was
your own making up. It’s many a time you
cheated me before with your lies. Come to the
cooking-pot, my stomach is pinched and rusty.
Would you have it to be creaking like a gate?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>I tell you it’s true. And more than that is
true. If you listen to what I say, you’ll forget
your stomach.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>I won’t.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BLIND MAN.</div>

<p>Listen. I know who the young man’s father
is, but I won’t say. I would be afraid to say.
Ah, Fool, you would forget everything if you
could know who the young man’s father is.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FOOL.</div>

<p>Who is it? Tell me now quick, or I’ll shake
you. Come, out with it, or I’ll shake you.</p>

<p>Wait, wait. There’s somebody coming.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is Cuchulain is coming. He’s coming back
with the High King. Go and ask Cuchulain.
He’ll tell you. It’s little you’ll care about the

that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="right">[<i><span class="small">BLIND MAN</span> goes out by side door.</i></div>

<p>I’ll ask him. Cuchulain will know. He was
in Aoife’s country. [<i>Goes up stage.</i>] I’ll ask him.
[<i>Turns and goes down stage.</i>] But, no. I won’t
ask him, I would be afraid. [<i>Going up again.</i>]
Yes, I will ask him. What harm in asking?
The Blind Man said I was to ask him. [<i>Going
down.</i>] No, no. I’ll not ask him. He might kill
me. I have but killed hens and geese and pigs.
He has killed kings. [<i>Goes up again almost to big
door.</i>] Who says I’m afraid? I’m not afraid.
I’m no coward. I’ll ask him. No, no, Cuchulain,
I’m not going to ask you.</p>

<h2>DEIRDRE</h2>

<div class="hang1">

<i>A Guest-house in a wood. It is a rough house of
timber; through the doors and some of the windows
one can see the great spaces of the wood, the sky
dimming, night closing in. But a window to the
left shows the thick leaves of a coppice; the landscape
suggests silence and loneliness. There is
a door to right and left, and through the side
windows one can see anybody who approaches
either door, a moment before he enters. In the
centre, a part of the house is curtained off; the
curtains are drawn. There are unlighted torches
in brackets on the walls. There is, at one side,
a small table with a chessboard and chessmen
upon it, and a wine flagon and loaf of bread.
At the other side of the room there is a brazier
with a fire; two women, with musical instruments
beside them, crouch about the brazier: they are
comely women of about forty. Another woman,
who carries a stringed instrument, enters hurriedly;
she speaks, at first standing in the doorway.</i></div>

hiding a great deal of the sky and sea on that

a long oar coming through an opening in the
bulwark. The deck rises in a series of steps
behind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves
overhead. All the woodwork is of dark green;
and the sail is dark green, with a blue pattern
upon it, having a little copper colour here and
there. The sky and sea are dark blue. All
the persons of the play are dressed in various
tints of green and blue, the men with helmets
and swords of copper, the woman with copper
ornaments upon her dress. When the play opens
there are four persons upon the deck. <span class="small">AIBRIC</span>

<p class="unindent"><span class="small"><span class="smcap">The</span> scene is the same as in the text except that the sail is
dull copper colour. The poop rises several feet above the
stage, and from the overhanging stern hangs a lanthorn with
a greenish light. The sea or sky is represented by a semi-circular
cloth of which nothing can be seen except a dark
abyss, for the stage is lighted by arc-lights so placed upon a
bridge over the proscenium as to throw a perpendicular light
upon the stage. The light is dim, and there are deep shadows
which waver as if with the passage of clouds over the moon.
The persons are dressed in blue and green, and move but
little. Some sailors are discovered crouching by the sail.
Forgael is asleep and Aibric standing by the tiller on the
raised poop.</span></p>

make a prey of these eight weeks, or any shore or
island to plunder or to harry. It is a hard thing,
age to be coming on me, and I not to get the chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of doing a robbery that would enable me to live quiet
and honest to the end of my lifetime.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> We are out since the new moon.
What is worse again, it is the way we are in a ship,
the barrels empty and my throat shrivelled with
drought, and nothing to quench it but water only.</p>

<p><i>Forgael</i> [<i>in his sleep</i>]. Yes; there, there; that hair
that is the colour of burning.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Listen to him now, calling out in his
sleep.</p>

<p><i>Forgael</i> [<i>in his sleep</i>]. That pale forehead, that hair
the colour of burning.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Some crazy dream he is in, and believe
me it is no crazier than the thought he has waking.
He is not the first that has had the wits drawn out
from him through shadows and fantasies.</p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> That is what ails him. I have been
thinking it this good while.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Do you remember that galley we sank
at the time of the full moon?</p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> I do. We were becalmed the same
night, and he sat up there playing that old harp of
his until the moon had set.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> I was sleeping up there by the bulwark,
and when I woke in the sound of the harp a
change came over my eyes, and I could see very
strange things. The dead were floating upon the sea
yet, and it seemed as if the life that went out of every
one of them had turned to the shape of a man-headed
bird—grey they were, and they rose up of a sudden
and called out with voices like our own, and flew
away singing to the west. Words like this they were
singing: ‘Happiness beyond measure, happiness
where the sun dies.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> I understand well what they are
doing. My mother used to be talking of birds of
the sort. They are sent by the lasting watchers to
lead men away from this world and its women to
some place of shining women that cast no shadow,
having lived before the making of the earth. But I
have no mind to go following him to that place.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Let us creep up to him and kill him
in his sleep.</p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> I would have made an end of him
long ago, but that I was in dread of his harp. It is
said that when he plays upon it he has power over
all the listeners, with or without the body, seen or
unseen, and any man that listens grows to be as mad
as himself.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> What way can he play it, being in
his sleep?</p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> But who would be our captain then
to make out a course from the Bear and the Pole-star,
and to bring us back home?</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> I have that thought out. We must
have Aibric with us. He knows the constellations
as well as Forgael. He is a good hand with the
sword. Join with us; be our captain, Aibric. We
are agreed to put an end to Forgael, before he wakes.
There is no man but will be glad of it when it is done.
Join with us, and you will have the captain’s share
and profit.</p>

<p><i>Aibric.</i> Silence! for you have taken Forgael’s pay.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Little pay we have had this twelvemonth.
We would never have turned against him
if he had brought us, as he promised, into seas that
would be thick with ships. That was the bargain.
What is the use of knocking about and fighting as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
we do unless we get the chance to drink more wine
and kiss more women than lasting peaceable men
through their long lifetime? You will be as good a
leader as ever he was himself, if you will but join us.</p>

<p class="metric1">
<i>Aibric.</i> And do you think that I will join myself<br />
To men like you, and murder him who has been<br />
My master from my earliest childhood up?<br />
No! nor to a world of men like you<br />
When Forgael’s in the other scale. Come! come!<br />
I’ll answer to more purpose when you have drawn<br />
That sword out of its scabbard.<br />
</p>


<p><i>First Sailor.</i> You have awaked him. We had best
go, for we have missed this chance.</p>

<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i> Have the birds passed us? I could hear your voice.</div>
<div class="metric2">But there were others.</div>

<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">I have seen nothing pass.</span></div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i> You are certain of it? I never wake from sleep</div>
<div class="metric2">But that I am afraid they may have passed;</div>
<div class="metric2">For they’re my only pilots. I have not seen them</div>
<div class="metric2">For many days, and yet there must be many</div>
<div class="metric2">Dying at every moment in the world.</div>

<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i> They have all but driven you crazy, and already</div>
<div class="verse">The sailors have been plotting for your death,</div>
<div class="metric2">And all the birds have cried into your ears</div>
<div class="metric2">Has lured you on to death.</div>

<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">No; but they promised—</span></div>

<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i> I know their promises. You have told me all.</div>
<div class="metric2">They are to bring you to unheard-of passion,</div>
<div class="metric2">To some strange love the world knows nothing of,</div>
<div class="metric2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>Some ever-living woman as you think,</div>
<div class="metric2">One that can cast no shadow, being unearthly.</div>
<div class="metric2">But that’s all folly. Turn the ship about,</div>
<div class="metric2">Sail home again, be some fair woman’s friend;</div>
<div class="metric2">Be satisfied to live like other men,</div>
<div class="metric2">And drive impossible dreams away. The world</div>
<div class="metric2">Has beautiful women to please every man.</div>

<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i> But he that gets their love after the fashion</div>
<div class="metric2">Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope</div>
<div class="metric2">And bodily tenderness, and finds that even</div>
<div class="metric2">The bed of love, that in the imagination</div>
<div class="metric2">Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,</div>
<div class="metric2">Is no more than a wine cup in the tasting,</div>
<div class="metric2">And as soon finished.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i>             <span style="margin-left: 6em;">All that ever loved</span></div>
<div class="metric2">Have loved that way—there is no other way.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i> Yet never have two lovers kissed but they</div>
<div class="metric2">Believed there was some other near at hand,</div>
<div class="metric2">And almost wept because they could not find it.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i> When they have twenty years; in middle life</div>
<div class="metric2">They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,</div>
<div class="metric2">And let the dream go by.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i>               <span style="margin-left: 6em;">It’s not a dream,</span></div>
<div class="metric2">But the reality that makes our passion</div>
<div class="metric2">As a lamp shadow—no—no lamp, the sun.</div>
<div class="metric2">What the world’s million lips are thirsting for,</div>
<div class="metric2">Must be substantial somewhere.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i>                      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I have heard the Druids</span></div>
<div class="metric2">Mutter such things as they awake from trance.</div>
<div class="metric2">It may be that the dead have lit upon it,</div>
<div class="metric2">Or those that never lived; no mortal can.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i> I only of all living men shall find it.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Aibric.</i> Then seek it in the habitable world,</div>
<div class="metric2">Or leap into that sea and end a journey</div>
<div class="metric2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>That has no other end.</div>
<div class="metric1"><i>Forgael.</i>               <span style="margin-left: 6em;">I cannot answer.</span></div>
<div class="metric2">I can see nothing plain; all’s mystery.</div>
<div class="metric2">Yet, sometimes there’s a torch inside my head</div>
<div class="metric2">That makes all clear, but when the light is gone</div>
<div class="metric2">I have but images, analogies,</div>
<div class="metric2">The mystic bread, the sacramental wine,</div>
<div class="metric2">The red rose where the two shafts of the cross,</div>
<div class="metric2">Body and soul, waking and sleep, death, life,</div>
<div class="metric2">Whatever meaning ancient allegorists</div>
<div class="metric2">Have settled on, are mixed into one joy.</div>
<div class="metric2">For what’s the rose but that? miraculous cries,</div>
<div class="metric2">Old stories about mystic marriages,</div>
<div class="metric2">Impossible truths? But when the torch is lit</div>
<div class="metric2">All that is impossible is certain,</div>
<div class="metric2">I plunge in the abyss.</div>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> Look there! There in the mist! A

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> We would not have noticed her but
for the sweet smell through the air. Ambergris and

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> No; but opoponax and cinnamon.</p>

<p><i>Forgael</i> [<i>taking the tiller from <span class="small">AIBRIC</span></i>]. The ever-living

<p><i>Aibric.</i> Take up that rope to make her fast while

will be others.</p>

<p><i>Aibric.</i> Speak lower or they’ll hear.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> They cannot hear; they are too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>

down and kissed her on the lips.</p>

men aboard she may not be too sorry in the end.</p>

<p><i>First Sailor.</i> She will be as dangerous as a wild cat.
These queens think more of the riches and the great
name they get by marriage than of a ready hand and
a strong body.</p>

<p><i>Second Sailor.</i> There is nobody is natural but a

<h2>APPENDIX II.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>A different Version of Deirdre’s Entrance.</small></span></h2>


<p>After the first performance of this play in the autumn of
1906, I rewrote the play up to the opening of the scene
where Naisi and Deirdre play chess. The new version was
played in the spring of 1907, and after that I rewrote from
the entrance of Deirdre to her questioning the musicians,
but felt, though despairing of setting it right, that it was
still mere bones, mere dramatic logic. The principal difficulty
with the form of dramatic structure I have adopted is
that, unlike the loose Elizabethan form, it continually forces
one by its rigour of logic away from one’s capacities, experiences,
and desires, until, if one have not patience to
wait for the mood, or to rewrite again and again till it comes,
there is rhetoric and logic and dry circumstance where
there should be life. After the version printed in the text
of this book had gone to press, Mrs. Patrick Campbell came
to our Abbey Theatre and, liking what she saw there, offered
to come and play Deirdre among us next November, and
this so stirred my imagination that the scene came right in
a moment. It needs some changes in the stage directions at
the beginning of the play. There is no longer need for loaf
and flagon, but the women at the braziers should when the
curtain rises be arraying themselves—the one holding a
mirror for the other perhaps. The play then goes on unchanged
till the entrance of Deirdre, when the following
scene is substituted for that on pages 139-140. (Bodb is
pronounced Bove.)</p>

<h2>APPENDIX III.<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Legendary and Mythological Foundation of
the Plays.</span></small></h2>


<p>The greater number of the stories I have used, and
persons I have spoken of, are in Lady Gregory’s <i>Gods and
Fighting Men</i> and <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i>. If my small
Dublin audience for poetical drama grows to any size,
whether now or at some future time, I shall owe it to these
two books, masterpieces of prose, which can but make the
old stories as familiar to Irishmen at any rate as are the stories
of Arthur and his Knights to all readers of books. I cannot
believe that it is from friendship that I weigh these books
with Malory, and feel no discontent at the tally, or that it
is the wish to make the substantial origin of my own art
familiar, that would make me give them before all other
books to young men and girls in Ireland. I wrote for the
most part before they were written, but all, or all but all, is
there. I took the Aengus and Edain of <i>The Shadowy Waters</i>
from poor translations of the various Aengus stories, which,
new translated by Lady Gregory, make up so much of what
is most beautiful in both her books. They had, however, so
completely become a part of my own thought that in 1897,
when I was still working on an early version of <i>The Shadowy
Waters</i>, I saw one night with my bodily eyes, as it seemed,
two beautiful persons, who would, I believe, have answered
to their names. The plot of the play itself has, however,
no definite old story for its foundation, but was woven to
a very great extent out of certain visionary experiences.</p>

<p>The foundations of <i>Deirdre</i> and of <i>On Baile’s Strand</i> are
stories called respectively the ‘Fate of the Sons of Usnach’
and ‘The Son of Aoife’ in <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The King’s Threshold</i> is, however, founded upon a middle-Irish
story of the demands of the poets at the Court of King
Guaire of Gort, but I have twisted it about and revised its
moral that the poet might have the best of it. It owes something
to a play on the same subject by my old friend Edwin
Ellis, who heard the story from me and wrote of it long ago.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX IV.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Dates and Places of Performance of Plays.</small></span></h2>


<p><i>The King’s Threshold</i> was first played October 7th, 1903,
in the Molesworth Hall, Dublin, by the Irish National
Theatre Society, and with the following cast:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="cast">
<tr><td align="left">Seanchan</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Frank Fay</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">King Guaire</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">P. Kelly</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lord High Chamberlain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Seumus O’Sullivan</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Soldier</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">William Conroy</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Monk</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">S. Sheridan-Neill</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Mayor</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">William Fay</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A Cripple</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Patrick Colum</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A Court Lady</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Honor Lavelle</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Another Court Lady</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Dora Melville</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A Princess</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Sara Algood</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Another Princess</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Dora Gunning</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Fedelm</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Maire ni Shiubhlaigh</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A Servant</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">P. MacShiubhlaigh</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Another Servant</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">P. Josephs</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A Pupil</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">G. Roberts</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Another Pupil</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Cartia MacCormac</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It has been revised a good many times since then, and
although the play has not been changed in the radical structure,
the parts of the Mayor, Servant, and Cripple are
altogether new, and the rest is altered here and there. It
was written when our Society was beginning its fight for the
recognition of pure art in a community of which one half is
buried in the practical affairs of life, and the other half in
politics and a propagandist patriotism.</p>

<p><i>On Baile’s Strand</i> was first played, in a version considerably
different from the present, on December 27th, 1904, at
the opening of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and with the
following cast:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Cast">
<tr><td align="left">Cuchulain</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Frank Fay</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Conchubar</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">George Roberts</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Daire (<i>an old King not now in the play</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">G. MacDonald</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The Blind Man</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Seumus O’Sullivan</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The Fool</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">William Fay</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The Young Man</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">P. MacShiubhlaigh</span></td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The old and young kings were played by the following:
R. Nash, A. Power, U. Wright, E. Keegan, Emma Vernon,
Dora Gunning, Sara Algood. It was necessary to put women
into men’s parts owing to the smallness of our company at
that time.</p>

<p>The play was revived by the National Theatre Society,
Ltd., in a somewhat altered version at Oxford, Cambridge,
and London a few months later. I then entirely rewrote it
up to the entrance of the Young Man, and changed it a
good deal from that on to the end, and this new version
was played at the Abbey Theatre for the first time in
April, 1906.</p>

<p>The first version of <i>The Shadowy Waters</i> was first performed
on January 14th, 1904, in the Molesworth Hall,
Dublin, with the following players in the principal parts:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="cast">
<tr><td align="left">Forgael</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Frank Fay</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Aibric</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Seumus O’Sullivan</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dectora&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><span class="smcap">Maire ni Shiubhlaigh</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Its production was an accident, for in the first instance I
had given it to the company that they might have some
practice in the speaking of my sort of blank verse until I
had a better play finished. It played badly enough from the
point of view of any ordinary playgoer, but pleased many of
my friends; and as I had been in America when it was
played, I got it played again privately, and gave it to Miss
Farr for a Theosophical Convention, that I might discover
how to make a better play of it. I then completely rewrote
it in the form that it has in the text of this book, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
version had once again to be condensed and altered for its
production in Dublin, 1906. Mr. Sinclair took the part of
Aibric, and Miss Darragh that of Dectora, while Mr. Frank
Fay was Forgael as before. It owed a considerable portion
of what success it met with both in its new and old form to
a successful colour scheme and to dreamy movements and
intonations on the part of the players. The scenery for its
performance in 1906 was designed by Mr. Robert Gregory.</p>

<p><i>Deirdre</i> was first played at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin,
on November 27th, 1906, with Miss Darragh as Deirdre,
Mr. Frank Fay as Naisi, Mr. Sinclair as Fergus, Mr.
Kerrigan as Conchubar, and Miss Sara Algood, Miss
McNeill, and Miss O’Dempsey as the Musicians. The
scenery was by Mr. Robert Gregory.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
