<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book is, in part, a reprint of
<i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i>, printed a
year ago on my sister's hand-press
at Dundrum, Co. Dublin. I have
not, however, reprinted a play which
may be a part of a book of new
plays suggested by the dance plays of
Japan, and I have added a number
of new poems. Michael Robartes and
John Aherne, whose names occur in
one or other of these, are characters
in some stories I wrote years ago,
who have once again become a part
of the phantasmagoria through which
I can alone express my convictions
about the world. I have the fancy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
that I read the name John Aherne
among those of men prosecuted for
making a disturbance at the first
production of "The Play Boy," which
may account for his animosity to
myself.</p>

Under your old wind-beaten tower, where still<br />
A lamp burns on beside the open book<br />

Enthralled by the unconquerable delusion<br />
Magical shapes.<br />

The man that Lapo and that Guido knew?<br />
I think he fashioned from his opposite<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>An image that might have been a stony face,<br />
Staring upon a bedouin's horse-hair roof<br />
From doored and windowed cliff, or half upturned<br />
Among the coarse grass and the camel dung.<br />
He set his chisel to the hardest stone.<br />
Being mocked by Guido for his lecherous life,<br />
Derided and deriding, driven out<br />
To climb that stair and eat that bitter bread,<br />
He found the unpersuadable justice, he found<br />
The most exalted lady loved by a man.</p>

<h2>THE PHASES OF THE MOON</h2>

<i>An old man cocked his ear upon a bridge;<br />
He and his friend, their faces to the South,<br />
Had trod the uneven road. Their boots were soiled,<br />
Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;<br />
They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,<br />
Despite a dwindling and late risen moon,<br />
Were distant. An old man cocked his ear.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">A rat or water-hen</span><br />
Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.<br />
We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,<br />
And the light proves that he is reading still.<br />
He has found, after the manner of his kind,<br />
Mere images; chosen this place to live in<br />
Because, it may be, of the candle light<br />
From the far tower where Milton's platonist<br />
Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:<br />
The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,<br />
An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;<br />
And now he seeks in book or manuscript<br />
What he shall never find.<br />

And when you have spoken take the roads again?</p>

Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,<br />
The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,<br />
Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty<br />

Among whims not impossible, and though scarred<br />
As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind,<br />
His body moulded from within his body<br />
Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then<br />
Athenae takes Achilles by the hair,<br />
Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,<br />

Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.<br />

Because all dark, like those that are all light,<br />

What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph<br />
At the perfection of one's own obedience;<br />

Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,<br />
Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall<br />
Beside the castle door, where all is stark<br />
Austerity, a place set out for wisdom<br />
That he will never find; I'd play a part;<br />
He would never know me after all these years<br />
But take me for some drunken country man;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>I'd stand and mutter there until he caught<br />
'Hunchback and saint and fool,' and that they came<br />
Under the three last crescents of the moon,<br />
And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits<br />
Day after day, yet never find the meaning.<br />
<br />
<i>And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard<br />
Should be so simple&mdash;a bat rose from the hazels<br />
And circled round him with its squeaky cry,<br />
The light in the tower window was put out.</i><br />

<span class="i0">When two close kindred meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What better than call a dance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From moonlit place to place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred moon overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has taken a new phase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will pass from change to change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that from round to crescent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From crescent to round they range?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, important and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifts to the changing moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His changing eyes.<br /></span>

<p>When I was a child at Sligo I could see above
my grandfather's trees a little column of smoke
from "the pern mill," and was told that "pern"
was another name for the spool, as I was accustomed
to call it, on which thread was wound.
One could not see the chimney for the trees, and
the smoke looked as if it came from the mountain,
and one day a foreign sea-captain asked me if
that was a burning mountain.</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
