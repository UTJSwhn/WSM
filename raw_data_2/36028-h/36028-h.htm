<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_vii" title="vii"> </a>PRELUDE</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">The</span> scene is the Albrechtstrasse, the main artery of the
capital, which runs from Albrechtsplatz and the Old Schloss
to the barracks of the Fusiliers of the Guard. The time is
noon on an ordinary week-day; the season of the year does
not matter. The weather is fair to moderate. It is not
raining, but the sky is not clear; it is a uniform light grey,
uninteresting and sombre, and the street lies in a dull and
sober light which robs it of all mystery, all individuality.
There is a moderate amount of traffic, without much noise
and crowd, corresponding to the not over-busy character
of the town. Tram-cars glide past, a cab or two rolls by,
along the pavement stroll a few residents, colourless folk,
passers-by, the public&mdash;&ldquo;people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two officers, their hands in the slanting pockets of their
grey great-coats, approach each other; a general and a
lieutenant. The general is coming from the Schloss, the
lieutenant from the direction of the barracks. The lieutenant
is quite young, a mere stripling, little more than a
child. He has narrow shoulders, dark hair, and the wide
cheek-bones so common in this part of the world, blue
rather tired-looking eyes, and a boyish face with a kind but
reserved expression. The general has snow-white hair, is
tall and broad-shouldered, altogether a commanding figure.
His eyebrows look like cotton-wool, and his moustache hangs
right down over his mouth and chin. He walks with slow
deliberation, his sword rattles on the asphalt, his plume flutters
in the wind, and at every step he takes the big red
lapel of his coat flaps slowly up and down.</p>

<p>And so these two draw near each other. Can this rencontre
lead to any complication? Impossible. Every
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_viii" title="viii"> </a>
observer can foresee the course this meeting will naturally
take. We have on one side and the other age and youth,
authority and obedience, years of services and docile apprenticeship&mdash;a
mighty hierarchical gulf, rules and prescriptions,
separate the two. Natural organization, take thy
course! And, instead, what happens? Instead, the following
surprising, painful, delightful, and topsy-turvy scene occurs.</p>

<p>The general, noticing the young lieutenant's approach, alters
his bearing in a surprising manner. He draws himself up,
yet at the same time seems to get smaller. He tones down
with a jerk, so to speak, the splendour of his appearance,
stops the clatter of his sword, and, while his face assumes
a cross and embarrassed expression, he obviously cannot
make up his mind where to turn his eyes, and tries to conceal
the fact by staring from under his cotton-wool eyebrows
at the asphalt straight in front of him.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant too betrays to the careful observer
some slight embarrassment, which however, strange to say,
he seems to succeed, better than the grey-haired general,
in cloaking with a certain grace and self-command. The
tension of his mouth is relaxed into a smile at once modest
and genial, and his eyes are directed with a quiet and self-possessed
calm, seemingly without an effort, over the general's
shoulder and beyond.</p>

<p>By now they have come within three paces of each other.
And, instead of the prescribed salute, the young lieutenant
throws his head slightly back, at the same time draws his
right hand&mdash;only his right, mark you&mdash;out of his coat-pocket
and makes with this same white-gloved right hand
a little encouraging and condescending movement, just opening
the fingers with palm upwards, nothing more. But the
general, who has awaited this sign with his arms to his
sides, raises his hand to his helmet, steps aside, bows, making
a half-circle as if to leave the pavement free, and
deferentially greets the lieutenant with reddening cheeks and
honest modest eyes. Thereupon the lieutenant, his hand to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_ix" title="ix"> </a>
his cap, answers the respectful greeting of his superior officer&mdash;answers
it with a look of child-like friendliness;
answers it&mdash;and goes on his way.</p>

<p>A miracle! A freak of fancy! He goes on his way.
People look at him, but he looks at nobody, looks straight
ahead through the crowd, with something of the air of a
woman who knows that she is being looked at. People greet
him; he returns the greeting, heartily and yet distantly.
He seems not to walk very easily; it looks as if he were not
much accustomed to the use of his legs, or as if the general
attention he excites bothers him, so irregular and hesitating
is his gait; indeed, at times he seems to limp. A policeman
springs to attention, a smart woman, coming out of a shop,
smiles and curtseys. People turn round to look at him,
nudge each other, stare at him, and softly whisper his
name&hellip;.</p>

<p>It is Klaus Heinrich, the younger brother of Albrecht&nbsp;II,
and heir presumptive to the throne. There he goes, he is
still in view. Known and yet a stranger, he moves among
the crowd&mdash;people all around him, and yet as if alone. He
goes on his lonely way and carries on his narrow shoulders
the burden of his Highness!</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_1" title="1"> </a>I<br/>
<small>THE CONSTRICTION</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Artillery</span> salvos were fired when the various new-fangled
means of communication in the capital spread the news that
the Grand Duchess Dorothea had given birth to a prince for
the second time at Grimmburg. Seventy-two rounds resounded
through the town and surrounding country, fired by the military
in the walls of the &ldquo;Citadel.&rdquo; Directly afterwards the
fire brigade also, not to be outdone, fired with the town salute-guns;
but in their firing there were long pauses between each
round, which caused much merriment among the populace.</p>

<p>The Grimmburg looked down from the top of a woody hill
on the picturesque little town of the same name, which mirrored
its grey sloping roofs in the river which flowed past
it. It could be reached from the capital in half an hour by
a local railway which paid no dividends. There the castle
stood, the proud creation of the Margrave Klaus Grimmbart,
the founder of the reigning house in the dim mists of history,
since then several times rejuvenated and repaired, fitted with
the comforts of the changing times, always kept in a habitable
state and held in peculiar honour as the ancestral seat of the
ruling house, the cradle of the dynasty. For it was a rule
and tradition of the house that all direct descendants of the
Margrave, every child of the reigning couple, must be born
there.</p>

<p>This tradition could not be ignored. The country had had
sophisticated and unbelieving sovereigns, who had laughed
at it, and yet had complied with it with a shrug of the shoulders.
It was now much too late to break away from it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
whether it was reasonable and enlightened or not: why, without
any particular necessity, break with an honoured custom,
which had managed somehow to perpetuate itself? The people
were convinced that there was something in it. Twice in
the course of fifteen generations had children of reigning
sovereigns, owing to some chance or other, first seen the light
in other schlosses: each had come to an unnatural and disgraceful
end. But all the sovereigns of the land and their
brothers and sisters, from Henry the Confessor and John the
Headstrong, with their lovely and proud sisters, down to
Albrecht, the father of the Grand Duke, and the Grand Duke
himself, Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III, had been brought into the world
in the castle; and there, six years before, Dorothea had given
birth to her firstborn, the Heir Apparent.</p>

<p>The castle was also a retreat as dignified as it was peaceful.
The coolness of its rooms, the shady charms of its surroundings,
made it preferable as a summer residence to the stiff
Hollerbrunn. The ascent from the town, up a rather badly
paved street between shabby cottages and a scrubby wall,
through massive gates to the ancient ruin at the entrance to
the castle-yard, in the middle of which stood the statue of
Klaus Grimmbart, the founder, was picturesque but tiring.
But a noble park spread at the back of the castle hill, through
which easy paths led up into the wooded and gently-swelling
uplands, offering ideal opportunities for carriage drives and
quiet strolls.</p>

<p>As for the inside of the castle, it had been last subjected
at the beginning of the reign of Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III to a
thorough clean-up and redecoration&mdash;at a cost which had
evoked much comment. The furniture of the living-rooms
had been completed and renewed in a style at once baronial
and comfortable; the escutcheons in the &ldquo;Hall of Justice&rdquo; had
been carefully restored to their original pattern. The gilding
of the intricate patterns on the vaulted ceilings looked fresh
and cheerful, all the rooms had been fitted with parquet, and
both the larger and the smaller banqueting-halls had been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>
adorned with huge wall-paintings from the brush of Professor
von Lindemann, a distinguished Academician, representing
scenes from the history of the reigning House executed in a
clear and smooth style which was far removed from and quite
unaffected by the restless tendencies of modern schools.
Nothing was wanting. As the old chimneys of the castle and
its many-coloured stoves, reaching tier upon tier right up to
the ceiling, were no longer fit to use, anthracite stoves had
been installed in view of the possibility of the place being
used as a residence during the winter.</p>

<p>But the day of the seventy-two salvos fell in the best
time of the year, late spring, early summer, the beginning
of June, soon after Whitsuntide. Johann Albrecht, who
had been early informed by telegram that the labour had
begun just before dawn, reached Grimmburg Station by
the bankrupt local railway at eight o'clock, where he was
greeted with congratulations by three or four dignitaries,
the mayor, the judge, the rector, and the town physician.
He at once drove to the castle. The Grand Duke was
accompanied by Minister of State, Dr. Baron Knobelsdorff,
and Adjutant-General of Infantry, Count Schmettern.
Shortly afterwards two or three more ministers arrived at
the royal residence, the Court Chaplin Dom Wislezenus,
President of the High Consistory, one or two Court officials,
and a still younger Adjutant, Captain von Lichterloh. Although
the Grand Duke's Physician-in-Ordinary, Surgeon-General
Dr. Eschrich, was attending the mother, Johann
Albrecht had been seized with the whim of requiring the
young local doctor, a Doctor Sammet, who was of Jewish
extraction into the bargain, to accompany him to the castle.
The unassuming, hard-working, and earnest man, who had
as much as he could do and was not in the least expecting
any such distinction, stammered &ldquo;Quite delighted &hellip; quite
delighted&rdquo; several times over, thus provoking some amusement.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess's bedroom was the &ldquo;Bride-chamber,&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
a five-cornered, brightly painted room on the first floor,
through whose window a fine view could be obtained of
woods, hills, and the windings of the river. It was decorated
with a frieze of medallion-shaped portraits, likenesses
of royal brides who had slept there in the olden days of the
family history.</p>

<p>There lay Dorothea; a broad piece of webbing was tied
round the foot of her bed, to which she clung like a child
playing at horses, while convulsions shook her lovely frame.
Doctor Gnadebusch, the midwife, a gentle and learned woman
with small fine hands and brown eyes, which wore a look
of mystery behind her round, thick spectacles, was supporting
the Duchess, while she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, steady, your Royal Highness&hellip;. It will soon
be over. It's quite easy&hellip;. Just once more &hellip; that's
nothing&hellip;. Rest a bit: knees apart&hellip;. Keep your chin
down&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A nurse, dressed like her in white linen, helped too, and
moved lightly about with phials and bandages during the
pauses. The Physician-in-Ordinary, a gloomy man with a
greyish beard, whose left eyelid seemed to droop, superintended
the birth. He wore his operating-coat over his
surgeon-general's uniform. From time to time there peeped
into the room, to ascertain the progress of the confinement,
Dorothea's trusty Mistress of the Robes, Baroness von
Schulenburg-Tressen, a corpulent and asthmatic woman of
distinctly dragoon-like appearance, who nevertheless liked
to display a generous expanse of neck and shoulders at
the court balls. She kissed her mistress's hand and went
back to an adjoining room, in which a couple of thin ladies-in-waiting
were chatting with the Grand Duchess's Chamberlain-in-Waiting,
a Count Windisch. Dr. Sammet, who had
thrown his linen coat like a domino over his dress-coat, was
waiting modestly and attentively by the washstand.</p>

<p>Johann Albrecht sat in a neighbouring room used as a
study, which was separated from the &ldquo;Bride-chamber&rdquo; only
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
by a so-called powder closet and a passage-room. It was
called the library, in view of several manuscript folios, which
lay slanting in the massive book-shelves and contained
the history of the castle. The room was furnished as
a writing-room. Globes adorned the walls. The strong
wind from the hills blew through the open bow-window.
The Grand Duke had ordered tea, and the groom of the
chamber, Prahl, had himself brought the tray; but it was
standing forgotten on the leaf of the desk, and Johann
Albrecht was pacing the room from one corner to the other
in a restless, uncomfortable frame of mind. His top-boots
kept creaking as he walked. His aide-de-camp, von Lichterloh,
listened to the noise, as he waited patiently in the
almost bare passage-room.</p>

<p>The Minister, the Adjutant-General, the Court Chaplain,
and the Court officials, nine or ten in all, were waiting in
the state-room on the ground floor. They wandered through
the larger and the smaller banqueting-halls, where trophies
of banners and weapons hung between Lindemann's pictures.
They leaned against the slender pillars, which spread
into brightly coloured vaulting above their heads. They
stood before the narrow, ceiling-high windows, and looked
out through the leaded panes over river and town; they sat
on the stone benches which ran round the walls, or on seats
before the stoves, whose Gothic tops were supported by
ridiculous little stooping imps of stone. The bright sunlight
made the gold lace on the uniforms, the orders on
the padded chests, the broad gold stripes on the trousers
of the dignitaries glisten.</p>

<p>The conversation flagged. Three-cornered hats and white-gloved
hands were constantly being raised to mouths which
opened convulsively. Nearly everybody had tears in his
eyes. Several had not had time to get any breakfast. Some
sought entertainment in a timid examination of the operating-instruments
and the round leather-cased chloroform jar,
which Surgeon-General Eschrich had left there in case of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
emergency. After von Bühl zu Bühl, the Lord Marshal,
a powerful man with mincing manners, brown toupée, gold-rimmed
pince-nez, and long, yellow fingernails, had told
several anecdotes in his quick, jerky way, he dropped into
an armchair, in which he made use of his gift of being
able to sleep with his eyes open&mdash;of losing consciousness
of time and place while retaining a steady gaze and alert
attitude, and in no way imperilling the dignity of the situation.</p>

<p>Dr. von Schröder, Minister of Finance and Agriculture,
had had a conversation earlier in the day with the Minister
of State, Dr. Baron Knobelsdorff, Minister of Home Affairs,
Foreign Affairs, and the Grand Ducal Household. It was
a spasmodic chat, which began with a discussion on art,
went on to financial and economic questions, alluded, somewhat
disapprovingly, to a High Court official, and did not
leave even the most exalted personages out of account. It
began with the two men standing, with their hats in their
hands behind their backs, in front of one of the pictures
in the larger banqueting-hall, each of them thinking more
than he said. The Finance Minister said: &ldquo;And this?
What's this? What's happening? Your Excellency is so
well informed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely superficially. It is the investiture of two Grand
princes of the blood by their uncle, the Emperor. As your
Excellency can see, the two young men are kneeling and
taking the oath with great solemnity on the Emperor's sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, extraordinarily fine! What colouring! Dazzling.
What lovely golden hair the princes have! And the Emperor
&hellip; exactly as he is described in the books! Yes,
that Lindemann well deserves all the distinctions which have
been given him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. Those which have been given him; those
he quite deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. von Schröder, a tall man with a white beard, a pair
of thin gold spectacles on his white nose, a belly protruding
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
slightly underneath his stomach, and a bull-neck, which
lapped over the stiff collar of his coat, looked, without taking
his eyes off the picture, somewhat doubtfully at it, under
the influence of a diffidence which seized him from time
to time during conversations with the baron. This Knobelsdorff,
this favourite and exalted functionary, was so enigmatical.
At times his remarks, his retorts, had an indefinable
tinge of irony about them. He was a widely travelled man,
he had been all over the world, he had so much general
knowledge, and interests of such a strange and exotic kind.
And yet he was a model of correctness. Herr von Schröder
could not quite understand him. However much one agreed
with him, it was impossible to feel that one really understood
him. His opinions were full of a mysterious reserve,
his judgments of a tolerance which left one wondering
whether they implied approval or contempt.</p>

<p>But the most suspicious thing about him was his laugh,
a laugh of the eyes in which the mouth took no part, a laugh
which seemed to be produced by the wrinkles radiating from
the corners of his eyes, or vice versa to have produced those
same wrinkles in the course of years. Baron Knobelsdorff
was younger than the Finance Minister; he was then in the
prime of life, although his close-trimmed moustache and
hair smoothly parted in the middle were already beginning
to turn grey&mdash;for the rest a squat, short-necked man, obviously
pinched by the collar of his heavily-laced court dress. He
left Herr von Schröder to his perplexity for a minute, and
then went on: &ldquo;Only perhaps it might be to the interests
of a prudent administration of the Privy Purse if the distinguished
professor had rested content with stars and
titles &hellip; to speak bluntly, what may all these delightful
works of art have cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr von Schröder recovered his animation. The desire,
the hope of understanding the Baron, of getting on to intimate
and confidential terms with him, excited him. &ldquo;Just
what I was thinking!&rdquo; said he, turning round to resume his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
walk through the galleries. &ldquo;Your Excellency has taken the
question out of my mouth. I wonder what this &lsquo;Investiture&rsquo;
cost, and all the rest of these wall-pictures. For the restoration
of the castle six years ago cost a million altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A solid million! And that amount was audited and approved
by Lord Marshal von Bühl zu Bühl, who is sitting
yonder in a state of comfortable catalepsy&mdash;audited, approved,
and disbursed by the Keeper of the Privy Purse, Count
Trümmerhauff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disbursed, or owing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the two!&hellip; This total, I say, debited to a fund,
a fund&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a word, the fund of the Grand Ducal settled estates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency knows as well as I what that means.
No, it makes me run cold&hellip;. I swear I am neither a skin-flint
nor a hypochondriac, but it makes me run cold when
I think of a man, with present conditions staring him in
the face, coolly throwing a million away&mdash;on what? On a
nothing, a pretty whim, on the beautification of the family
schloss in which his babies have to be born&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff laughed. &ldquo;Yes, Heaven knows romance
is a luxury, and a mighty expensive one too! Excellency,
I agree with you&mdash;of course. But consider, after
all the whole trouble in the Grand Ducal finances is due
to this same romantic luxury. The root of the evil lies in
the fact that the ruling dynasty are farmers; their capital
consists in land and soil, their income in agricultural profits.
At the present day&hellip;. They have not been able up to
the present to make up their minds to turn into industrialists
and financiers. They allow themselves with regrettable
obstinacy to be swayed by certain obsolete and idealistic conceptions,
such as, for instance, the conceptions of trust and
dignity. The royal property is hampered by a trust entailed
in fact. Advantageous alienations are barred.
Mortgages, the raising of capital on credit for commercial
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
improvements, seem to them improper. The administration
is seriously hindered in the free exploitation of business
opportunities&mdash;by ideas of dignity. You'll forgive me, won't
you? I'm telling you the absolute truth. People who pay
so much attention to propriety as these of course cannot and
will not keep pace with the freer and less hampered initiative
of less obstinate and unpractical business people. Now then,
what, in comparison with this negative luxury, does the positive
million signify, which has been sacrificed to a pretty
whim, to borrow your Excellency's expression? If it only
stopped there! But we have the regular expenses of a fairly
dignified Court to meet. There are the schlosses and their
parks to keep up, Hollerbrunn, Monbrillant, Jägerpreis,
aren't there? The Hermitage, Delphinenort, the Pheasantry,
and the others&hellip;. I had forgotten Schloss Zegenhaus
and the Haderstein ruins &hellip; not to mention the Old
Schloss&hellip;. They are not well kept up, but they all cost
money&hellip;. There are the Court Theatre, the Picture Gallery,
the Library, to maintain. There are a hundred pensions
to pay,&mdash;no legal compulsion to pay them, but motives of
trust and dignity. And look at the princely way in which
the Grand Duke behaved at the time of the last floods&hellip;.
But I'm preaching you a regular sermon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sermon,&rdquo; said the Minister of Finance, &ldquo;which your
Excellency thought would shock me, while you really only
confirmed my own view. Dear Baron&rdquo;&mdash;here Herr von
Schröder laid his hand on his heart,&mdash;&ldquo;I am convinced that
there is no longer room for any misunderstanding as to my
opinion, my loyal opinion, between you and me. The King
can do no wrong&hellip;. The sovereign is beyond the reach
of reproaches. But here we have to do with a default &hellip; in
both senses of the word!&hellip; a default which I have no
hesitation in laying at the door of Count Trümmerhauff. His
predecessors may be pardoned for having concealed from
their sovereigns the true state of the Court finances; in those
days nothing else was expected of them. But Count Trümmerhauff's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
attitude now is not pardonable. In his position
as Keeper of the Privy Purse he ought to have felt it incumbent
on him to put a brake on his Highness's thoughtlessness,
to feel it incumbent on him now to open his Royal
Highness's eyes relentlessly to the facts&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Knobelsdorff knitted his brows and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So your Excellency is of the opinion
that that is what the Count was appointed for! I can picture
to myself the justifiable astonishment of his lordship,
if you lay before him your view of the position. No, no &hellip;
your Excellency need be under no delusion; that appointment
was a quite deliberate expression of his wishes on the part
of his Royal Highness, which the Count must be the first
to respect. It expressed not only an &lsquo;I don't know,&rsquo; but
also an &lsquo;I won't know.&rsquo; A man may be an exclusively decorative
personality and yet be acute enough to grasp this&hellip;.
Besides &hellip; honestly &hellip; we've all of us grasped it. And
the only grain of comfort for all of us is this: that there
isn't a prince alive to whom it would be more fatal to mention
his debts than to his Royal Highness. Our Prince has
a something about him which would stop any tactless remarks
of that sort before they were spoken&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true, quite true,&rdquo; said Herr von Schröder. He
sighed and stroked thoughtfully the swansdown trimming of
his hat. The two men were sitting, half turned towards
each other, on a raised window seat in a roomy niche, past
which a narrow stone corridor ran outside, a kind of gallery,
through the pointed arches of which peeps of the town could
be seen. Herr von Schröder went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You answer me, Baron; one would think you were contradicting
me, and yet your words show more incredulity
and bitterness than my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff said nothing, but made a vague gesture
of assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said the Finance Minister, and nodded
gloomily at his hat. &ldquo;Your Excellency may be quite right.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
Perhaps we are all blameworthy, we and our forefathers
too. But it ought to have been stopped. For consider, Baron;
ten years ago an opportunity offered itself of putting the
finances of the Court on a sound footing, on a better footing
anyhow, if you like. It was lost. We understand each
other. The Grand Duke, attractive man that he is, had it
then in his power to clear things up by a marriage which
from a sound point of view might have been called dazzling.
Instead of that &hellip; speaking not for myself, of course, but
I shall never forget the disgust on everybody's faces when
they mentioned the amount of the dowry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Grand Duchess,&rdquo; said Herr von Knobelsdorff, and
the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes disappeared almost
entirely, &ldquo;is one of the handsomest women I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an answer one would expect of your Excellency.
It's an æsthetic answer, an answer which would have held
quite as good if his Royal Highness's choice, like his brother
Lambert's, had fallen on a member of the royal ballet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was no danger of that. The Prince's taste is
a fastidious one, as he has shown. He has always shown
in his wants the antithesis to that want of taste which Prince
Lambert has shown all his life. It was a long time before
he made up his mind to marry. Everybody had given
up all hope of a direct heir to the throne. They were resigned
for better or worse to Prince Lambert, whose &hellip;
unsuitability to be heir to the throne we need not discuss.
Then, a few weeks after he had succeeded, Johann Albrecht
met Princess Dorothea, cried, &ldquo;This one or none!&rdquo; and the
Grand Duchy had its sovereign lady. Your Excellency mentioned
the thoughtful looks which were exchanged when the
figures of the dowry were published,&mdash;you did not mention
the jubilation which at the same time prevailed. A poor
princess, to be sure. But is beauty, such beauty, a power
of happiness or not? Never shall I forget her entry! Her
first smile, as it lighted on the gazing crowds, won their love.
Your Excellency must allow me to profess once more my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
belief in the idealism of the people. The people want to
see their best, their highest, their dream, what stands for
their soul, represented in their princes&mdash;not their money
bags. There are others to represent those&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what there are not; just what we have not
got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more's the pity, then. The main point is, Dorothea
has presented us with an Heir Apparent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom may Heaven grant some idea of figures!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point the conversation between the two Ministers
ceased. It was broken off by the announcement by aide-de-camp
von Lichterloh, of the happy issue of the confinement.
The smaller banqueting-hall was soon filled with officials.
One of the great carved doors was quickly thrown
open, and the aide-de-camp appeared in the hall. He had
a red face, blue soldier's eyes, a bristling flaxen moustache,
and silver lace on his collar. He looked somewhat excited,
like a man who had been released from deadly boredom
and was primed with good news. Conscious of the unusualness
of the occasion, he boldly ignored the rules of
decorum and etiquette. He saluted the company gaily,
and, spreading his elbows, raised the hilt of his sword
almost to his breast crying: &ldquo;Beg leave to announce: a
prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Adjutant-General Count Schmettern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful, quite delightful, I call that perfectly delightful!&rdquo;
said Lord Marshal von Bühl zu Bühl in his jerky
way; he had recovered consciousness at once.</p>

<p>The President of the High Consistory, Dom Wislezenus&mdash;a
clean-shaven, well-built man, who, as a son of a general, and
thanks to his personal distinction, had attained to his high
dignity at a comparatively early age, and on whose black
silk gown hung the star of an Order&mdash;folded his white hands
on his breast, and said in a melodious voice, &ldquo;God bless his
Grand Ducal Highness!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>&ldquo;You forget, Captain,&rdquo; said Herr von Knobelsdorff, laughing,
&ldquo;that in making your announcement you are encroaching
on my privileges and province. Until I have made the
most searching investigations into the state of affairs, the
question whether it is a prince or a princess remains undecided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others laughed, and Herr von Lichterloh replied:
&ldquo;As you wish, your Excellency! Then I have the honour
to beg your Excellency to assume this most important
charge&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This dialogue referred to the attributes of the Minister
of State, as registrar of the Grand Ducal house, in which
capacity he was required to satisfy himself with his own
eyes of the sex of the princely offspring and to make an
official declaration on the subject. Herr von Knobelsdorff
complied with this formality in the so-called powder-closet
in which the new-born babe was bathed. He stayed longer
there, however, than he had intended to, as he was puzzled
and arrested by a painful sight, which at first he mentioned
to nobody except the midwife.</p>

<p>Doctor Gnadebusch showed him the child, and her eyes,
gleaming mysteriously behind her thick spectacles, travelled
between the Minister of State and the little copper-coloured
creature, as it groped about with one&mdash;only one&mdash;little hand,
as if she was saying: &ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all right. Herr von Knobelsdorff was satisfied,
and the wise woman wrapped the child up again. But even
then she continued to look down at the Prince and then up
at the Baron, until she had drawn his eyes to the point to
which she wished to attract them. The wrinkles at the
corners of his eyes disappeared, he knit his brows, tried,
compared, felt, examined for two or three minutes, and at
last asked: &ldquo;Has the Grand Duke yet seen it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Grand Duke sees it,&rdquo; said Herr von Knobelsdorff,
&ldquo;tell him that he will grow out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>And to the others on the ground-floor he reported&mdash;&ldquo;A
splendid prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But ten or fifteen minutes after him the Grand Duke also
made the disagreeable discovery,&mdash;that was unavoidable,
and resulted for Surgeon-General Eschrich in a short, extremely
unpleasant scene, but for the Grimmburg Doctor
Sammet in an interview with the Grand Duke which raised
him considerably in the latter's estimation and was useful
to him in his subsequent career. What happened was briefly
as follows:</p>

<p>After the birth Johann Albrecht had again retired to the
library, and then returned to sit for some time at the bedside
with his wife's hand in his. Thereupon he went into
the &ldquo;powder-closet,&rdquo; where the infant now lay in his high,
richly gilded cradle, half covered with a blue silk curtain,
and sat down in an armchair by the side of his little son.
But while he sat and watched the sleeping infant it happened
that he noticed what it was hoped that he would not
notice yet. He drew the counterpane back, his face clouded
over, and then he did exactly what Herr von Knobelsdorff
had done before him, looked from Doctor Gnadebusch to
the nurse and back again, both of whom said nothing, cast
one glance at the half-open door into the bride-chamber,
and stalked excitedly back into the library.</p>

<p>Here he at once rang the silver eagle-topped bell which
stood on the writing-table, and said to Herr von Lichterloh,
who came in, very curtly and coldly: &ldquo;I require Herr
Eschrich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Grand Duke was angry with any member of
his suite, he was wont to strip the culprit for the moment
of all his titles and dignities, and to leave him nothing but
his bare name.</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp again clapped his spurs and heels together
and withdrew. Johann Albrecht strode once or twice
in a rage up and down the room, and then, hearing Herr
von Lichterloh bring the person he had summoned into the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
ante-room, adopted an audience attitude at his writing-table.</p>

<p>As he stood there, his head turned imperiously in half-profile,
his left hand planted on his hip, drawing back his
satin-fronted frock coat from his white waistcoat, he exactly
resembled his portrait by Professor von Lindemann, which
hung beside the big looking-glass over the mantelpiece in
the &ldquo;Hall of the Twelve Months&rdquo; in the Town Schloss, opposite
the portrait of Dorothea, and of which countless engravings,
photographs, and picture postcards had been
published. The only difference was that Johann Albrecht in
the portrait seemed to be of heroic stature, while he really
was scarcely of medium height. His forehead was high
where his hair had receded, and from under his grey eyebrows,
his blue eyes looked out, with dark rings round them,
giving them an expression of tired haughtiness. He had the
broad, rather too high cheek-bones which were a characteristic
of his people. His whiskers and the soft tuft on his
chin were grey, his moustache almost white. From the distended
nostrils of his small but well-arched nose, two
unusually deep furrows ran down to his chin. The lemon-coloured
ribbon of the Family Order always showed in the
opening of his waistcoat. In his buttonhole the Grand Duke
wore a carnation.</p>

<p>Surgeon-General Eschrich entered with a low bow. He
had taken off his operating-coat. His eyelid drooped more
heavily than usual over his eye. He looked apprehensive and
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke, his left hand on his hip, threw his head
back, stretched out his right hand and waved it, palm upwards,
several times up and down impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am awaiting an explanation, a justification, Surgeon-General,&rdquo;
said he, with a voice trembling with irritation.
&ldquo;You will have the goodness to answer my questions. What
is the matter with the child's arm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Physician-in-Ordinary raised his hand a little&mdash;a feeble
gesture of impotence and blamelessness. He said:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>&ldquo;An it please Your Royal Highness&hellip;. An unfortunate
occurrence. Unfavourable circumstances during the pregnancy
of her Royal Highness&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all nonsense!&rdquo; The Grand Duke was so much excited
that he did not wish for any justification, in fact he
would not allow one. &ldquo;I would remind you, sir, that I
am beside myself. Unfortunate occurrence! It was your
business to take precautions against unfortunate occurrences&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Surgeon-General stood with half-bowed head and,
sinking his voice to a submissive tone, addressed the ground
at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I humbly beg to be allowed to remind you that I, at
least, am not alone responsible. Privy Councillor Grasanger&mdash;an
authority on gynæcology&mdash;examined her Royal Highness.
But nobody can be held responsible in this case&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody &hellip; Really! I permit myself to make you
responsible&hellip;. You are answerable to me&hellip;. You were
in charge during the pregnancy, you superintended the confinement.
I have relied on the knowledge to be expected
from your rank, Surgeon-General, I have trusted to your
experience. I am bitterly disappointed, bitterly disappointed.
All that your skill can boast of is &hellip; that a crippled child
has been born&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would your Royal Highness graciously weigh&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have weighed. I have weighed and found wanting.
Thank you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surgeon-General Eschrich retired backwards, bowing. In
the ante-room he shrugged his shoulders, while his cheeks
glowed.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke again fell to pacing the library in his
princely wrath, unreasonable, misinformed, and foolish in
his loneliness. However, whether it was that he wished to
humiliate the Physician-in-Ordinary still further, or that he
regretted having robbed himself of any explanations&mdash;ten
minutes later the unexpected happened, and the Grand Duke
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
sent Herr von Lichterloh to summon young Doctor Sammet
to the library.</p>

<p>The doctor, when he received the message, again said:
&ldquo;Quite delighted &hellip; quite delighted,&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; and at first
changed colour a little, then composed himself admirably.
It is true that he was not a complete master of the prescribed
etiquette, and bowed too soon, while he was still in the door,
so that the aide-de-camp could not close it behind him, and
had to ask him in a whisper to move forward; but afterwards
he stood in an easy and unconstrained attitude, and gave
reassuring answers, although he showed that he was naturally
rather slow of speech, beginning his sentences with hesitating
noises and frequently interspersing them with a &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as if
to confirm what he was saying. He wore his dark yellow
hair cut <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en brosse</i> and his moustache untrimmed. His chin
and cheeks were clean-shaved, and rather sore from it. He
carried his head a little on one side, and the gaze of his grey
eyes told of shrewdness and practical goodness. His nose,
which was too broad at the bottom, pointed to his origin. He
wore a black tie, and his shiny boots were of a country cut.
He kept his elbows close to his side, with one hand on his silver
watch-chain. His whole appearance suggested candour
and professional skill; it inspired confidence.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke addressed him unusually graciously,
rather in the manner of a teacher who has been scolding
a naughty boy, and turns to another with a sudden assumption
of mildness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent for you, doctor&hellip;. I want information from
you about this peculiarity in the body of the new-born prince&hellip;.
I assume that it has not escaped your notice&hellip;.
I am confronted with a riddle &hellip; an extremely painful
riddle&hellip;. In a word, I desire your opinion.&rdquo; And the
Grand Duke, changing his position, ended with a gracious
motion of the hand, which encouraged the doctor to speak.</p>

<p>Dr. Sammet looked at him silently and attentively, as if
waiting till the Grand Duke had completely regained his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
princely composure. Then he said: &ldquo;Yes; we have here
to do with a case which is not of very common occurrence,
but which is well known and familiar to us. Yes. It is
actually a case of atrophy&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me &hellip; atrophy&nbsp;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Royal Highness. I mean stunted growth.
Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, stunted growth. Stunting. That's it. The left
hand is stunted. But it's unheard of! I cannot understand
it! Such a thing has never happened in my family! People
talk nowadays about heredity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the doctor looked silently and attentively at the
lonely and domineering man, to whom the news had only
just penetrated that people were talking lately about heredity.
He answered simply: &ldquo;Pardon me, Royal Highness, but in
this case there can be no question of heredity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! You're quite sure!&rdquo; said the Grand Duke rather
mockingly. &ldquo;That is one satisfaction. But will you be so
kind as to tell me what there can be a question of, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, Royal Highness. The cause of the malformation
is entirely a mechanical one. It has been caused
through a mechanical constriction during the development
of the embryo. We call such malformations constriction-formations,
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke listened with anxious disgust; he
obviously feared the effect of each succeeding word on his
sensitiveness. He kept his brows knit and his mouth open:
the two furrows running down to his beard seemed deeper
than ever. He said: &ldquo;Constriction-formations, &hellip; but
how in the world &hellip; I am quite sure every precaution
must have been taken&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Constriction-formations,&rdquo; answered Dr. Sammet, &ldquo;can
occur in various ways. But we can say with comparative
certainty that in our case &hellip; in this case it is the amnion
which is to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&hellip;. The amnion?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>&ldquo;That is one of the f&oelig;tal membranes, Royal Highness.
Yes. And in certain circumstances the removal of this membrane
from the embryo may be retarded and proceed so
slowly that threads and cords are left stretching from one
to the other &hellip; amniotic threads as we call them, yes.
These threads may be dangerous, for they can bind and
knot themselves round the whole of a child's limb; they can
entirely intercept, for instance, the life-ducts of a hand and
even amputate it. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens &hellip; amputate it. So we must be thankful
that it has not come to an amputation of the hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might have happened. Yes. But all that has happened
is an unfastening, resulting in an atrophy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that could not be discovered, foreseen, prevented?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Royal Highness. Absolutely not. It is quite certain
that no blame whatever attaches to anybody. Such constrictions
do their work in secret. We are powerless against them.
Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the malformation is incurable? The hand will remain
stunted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Sammet hesitated; he looked kindly at the Grand
Duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will never be quite normal, certainly not,&rdquo; he said
cautiously. &ldquo;But the stunted hand will grow a little larger
than it is at present, oh yes, it assuredly will&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he be able to use it? For instance &hellip; to hold
his reins or to make gestures, like any one else?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use it &hellip; a little&hellip;. Perhaps not much. And he's
got his right hand, that's all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it be very obvious?&rdquo; asked the Grand Duke, and
scanned Dr. Sammet's face earnestly. &ldquo;Very noticeable?
Will it detract much from his general appearance, think
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many people,&rdquo; answered Dr. Sammet evasively, &ldquo;live and
work under greater disadvantages. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke turned away, and walked once up and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
down the room. Dr. Sammet deferentially made way for
him, and withdrew towards the door. At last the Grand
Duke resumed his position at the writing-table and said: &ldquo;I
have now heard what I wanted to know, doctor; I thank you
for your report. You understand your business, no doubt
about that. Why do you live in Grimmburg? Why do you
not practise in the capital?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still young, Royal Highness, and before I devote myself
to practising as a specialist in the capital I should like
a few years of really varied practice, of general experience
and research. A country town like Grimmburg affords the
best opportunity of that. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sound, very admirable of you. In what do you
propose to specialise later on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the diseases of children, Royal Highness. I intend to
be a children's doctor, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a Jew?&rdquo; asked the Grand Duke, throwing back
his head and screwing up his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Royal Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;will you answer me one more question? Have you
ever found your origin to stand in your way, a drawback in
your professional career? I ask as a ruler, who is especially
concerned that the principle of &lsquo;equal chances for all&rsquo; shall
hold good unconditionally and privately, not only officially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody in the Grand Duchy,&rdquo; answered Dr. Sammet,
&ldquo;has the right to work.&rdquo; But he did not stop there: moving
his elbows like a pair of short wings, in an awkward, impassioned
way, he made a few hesitating noises, and then added
in a restrained but eager voice: &ldquo;No principle of equalization,
if I may be allowed to remark, will ever prevent the
incidence in the life of the community of exceptional and
abnormal men who are distinguished from the bourgeois by
their nobleness or infamy. It is the duty of the individual
not to concern himself as to the precise nature of the distinction
between him and the common herd, but to see what is the
essential in that distinction and to recognize that it imposes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
on him an exceptional obligation towards society. A man
is at an advantage, not at a disadvantage, compared with the
regular and therefore complacent majority, if he has one
motive more than they to extraordinary exertions. Yes, yes,&rdquo;
repeated Dr. Sammet. The double affirmative was meant to
confirm his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good &hellip; not bad; very remarkable, anyhow,&rdquo; said the
Grand Duke judicially. He found Dr. Sammet's words
suggestive, though somewhat off the point. He dismissed the
young man with the words: &ldquo;Well, doctor, my time is
limited. I thank you. This interview&mdash;apart from its painful
occasion&mdash;has much reassured me. I have the pleasure
of bestowing on you the Albrecht Cross of the Third Class
with Crown. I shall remember you. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was what passed between the Grimmburg doctor and
the Grand Duke. Shortly after Johann Albrecht left the
castle and returned by special train to the capital, chiefly to
show himself to the rejoicing populace, but also in order
to give several audiences in the palace. It was arranged
that he should return in the evening to the castle, and take
up his residence there for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>All those present at the confinement at Grimmburg who
did not belong to the Grand Duchess's suite were also accommodated
in the special train of the bankrupt local railway,
some of them travelling in the Sovereign's own saloon.
But the Grand Duke drove from the castle to the station alone
with von Knobelsdorff, the Minister of State, in an open
landau, one of the brown Court carriages with the little golden
crown on the door. The white feathers in the hats of the
chasseurs in front fluttered in the summer breeze. Johann
Albrecht was grave and silent on the journey; he seemed to
be worried and morose. And although Herr von Knobelsdorff
knew that the Grand Duke, even in private, disliked
anybody addressing him unasked and uninvited, yet at last
he made up his mind to break the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness,&rdquo; he said deprecatingly, &ldquo;seems to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
take so much to heart the little anomaly which has been discovered
in the Prince's body, &hellip; and yet one would think
that on a day like this the reasons for joy and proud thankfulness
so far outweigh&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Knobelsdorff,&rdquo; replied Johann Albrecht, with
some irritation and almost in tears, &ldquo;you must forgive my
ill-humour; you surely do not wish me to be in good spirits.
I can see no reason for being so. The Grand Duchess is
going on well&mdash;true enough, and the child is a boy&mdash;that's
a blessing too. But he has come into the world with an
atrophy, a constriction, caused by amniotic threads. Nobody
is to blame, it is a misfortune; but misfortunes for which
nobody is to blame are the most terrible of all misfortunes,
and the sight of their Sovereign ought to awaken in his people
other feelings than those of sympathy. The Heir Apparent
is delicate, needs constant care. It was a miracle that he
survived that attack of pleurisy two years ago, and it will
be nothing less than a miracle if he lives to attain his majority.
Now Heaven grants me a second son&mdash;he seems strong, but
he comes into the world with only one hand. The other is
stunted, useless, a deformity, he will have to hide it. What
a drawback! What an impediment! He will have to brave
it out before the world all his life. We must let it gradually
leak out, so that it may not cause too much of a shock on
his first appearance in public. No, I cannot yet get over it.
A prince with one hand&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With one hand,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Herr von Knobelsdorff. &ldquo;Did
your Royal Highness use that expression twice deliberately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deliberately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not, then?&hellip; For the Prince has two hands,
yet as one is stunted, one might if one liked also describe
him as a prince with one hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one must almost wish, not that your Royal Highness's
second son, but that the heir to the throne were the
victim of this small malformation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, your Royal Highness will laugh at me; but I am
thinking of the gipsy woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gipsy woman? Please go on, my dear Baron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the gipsy woman&mdash;forgive me!&mdash;who a hundred years
ago prophesied the birth of a Prince to your Royal Highness's
house&mdash;a prince &lsquo;with one hand&rsquo;&mdash;that is how tradition
puts it&mdash;and attached to the birth of that prince a certain
promise, couched in peculiar terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke turned on his seat and stared, without saying
a word, at Herr von Knobelsdorff, at the outer corner of
whose eyes the radiating wrinkles were playing. Then, &ldquo;Mighty
entertaining!&rdquo; he said, and resumed his former attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prophecies,&rdquo; continued Herr von Knobelsdorff, &ldquo;generally
come true to this extent, that circumstances arise which
one can interpret, if one has a mind to, in their sense. And
the broadness of the terms in which every proper prophecy
is couched makes this all the more easy. &lsquo;With one hand&rsquo;&mdash;that
is regular oracle-style. What has actually happened is
a moderate case of atrophy. But that much counts for a
good deal, for what is there to prevent me, what is there to
prevent the people, from assuming the whole by this partial
fulfilment, and declaring that the conditional part of the
prophecy has been fulfilled? The people will do so; if not
at once, at any rate if the rest of the prophecy, the actual
promise, is in any way realised, it will put two and two together,
as it always has done, in its wish to see what is written
turn out true. I don't see how it is going to come about&mdash;the
Prince is a younger son, he will not come to the throne,
the intentions of fate are obscure. But the one-handed prince
is there&mdash;and so may he bestow on us as much as he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke did not answer, secretly thrilled by dreams
of the future of his dynasty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Knobelsdorff, I will not be angry with you. You
want to comfort me, and you have not done it badly. But
I must do what is expected of me&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>The air resounded with the distant cheers of many voices.
The people of Grimmburg were crowded in black masses
behind the cordon at the station. Officials were standing
apart in front, waiting for the carriages. There was the
mayor, raising his top-hat, wiping his forehead with a
crumpled handkerchief, and poring over a paper whose contents
he was committing to memory. Johann Albrecht assumed
the expression appropriate to listening to the smoothly
worded address and to answering concisely and graciously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most excellent Mr. Mayor&hellip;.&rdquo; The town was dressed
with flags, and the bells were ringing.</p>

<p>In the capital all the bells were ringing. And in the
evening there were illuminations; not by formal request of
the authorities, but spontaneous&mdash;the whole city was a blaze
of light.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>II<br/>
<small>THE COUNTRY</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">The</span> country measured eight thousand square kilometres, and
numbered one million inhabitants.</p>

<p>A pretty, quiet, leisurely country. The tops of the trees
in its forests rustled dreamily; its broad acres showed signs
of honest care; its industries were undeveloped to the point
of indigence.</p>

<p>It possessed some brick-kilns, a few salt and silver-mines&mdash;that
was almost all. A certain amount of tourist-traffic must
also be mentioned, but he would be a bold man who described
it as a flourishing industry. The alkali springs, which rose
from the ground in the immediate neighbourhood of the
capital and formed the centre of an attractive bathing-establishment,
constituted the claims of the city to be considered
a health resort. But while the baths at the end of
the Middle Ages had been frequented by visitors from afar,
they had later lost their repute, and been put in the shade
by other baths and forgotten. The most valuable of the
springs, that called the Ditlinde spring, which was exceptionally
rich in lithium salts, had been opened up quite recently,
in the reign of Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III, and as energetic business
and advertising methods were not employed, its water had not
yet succeeded in winning world-recognition. A hundred
thousand bottles of it were sent away in the year&mdash;rather
less than more. And but few strangers came to drink it on
the spot&hellip;.</p>

<p>The Diet was the scene all the year round of speeches about
the &ldquo;barely&rdquo; satisfactory results of the trade returns, by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
which was really meant the entirely unsatisfactory results,
which nobody could dispute, that the local railways did not
cover their expenses and the main lines did not pay any
dividends&mdash;distressing but unalterable and inveterate facts,
which the Minister for Trade in luminous but monotonous
declarations explained by the peaceful commercial and
industrial circumstances of the country, as well as by the
inaccessibility of the home coal-deposits. Critics added something
about defective organization of the State industrial
administration. But the spirit of contradiction and negation
was not strong in the Diet; the prevailing frame of
mind among the representatives of the people was one of
dull and true-hearted loyalty.</p>

<p>So the railway revenues did not by any means rank first
among the public revenues of a private-investment nature;
the forest revenues had ranked first for years in this land
of woods and plough. The fall in them, their startling depreciation,
however sufficient reasons there were for it, was
a much more difficult matter to mend.</p>

<p>The people loved their woods. They were a fair and compact
type, with searching blue eyes and broad, rather high
cheek-bones, a sensible and honest, solid and backward stamp
of men. They clung to their country's forest with all the
strength of their nature; it lived in their bones, it was to
the artists which it bred the source and home of their inspirations,
and it was quite properly the object of popular
gratitude, not only in regard to the gifts of soul and intellect
of which it was the donor. The poor gathered their firewood
in the forest; it gave to them freely, they had it for nothing.
They went stooping and gathering all kinds of berries
and mushrooms among its trunks, and earned a little something
by doing so. That was not all. The people recognized
that their forest had a very distinctly favourable influence
on the weather and the healthy condition of the country;
they were well aware that without the lovely woods in the
neighbourhood of the capital the spa-garden outside would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
not attract foreigners with money to spend; in short, this
not over-industrious and up-to-date people could not help
knowing that the forest stood for the most important asset,
the most profitable heritage of the country.</p>

<p>And yet the forest had been sinned against, outraged for
ages and ages. The Grand Ducal Department of Woods
and Forests deserved all the reproaches that were laid against
it. That Department had not political insight enough to
see that the wood must be maintained and kept as inalienable
common property, if it was to be useful not only to
the present generation, but also to those to come; and that
it would surely avenge itself if it were exploited recklessly
and short-sightedly, without regard to the future, for the benefit
of the present.</p>

<p>That was what happened, and was still happening. In
the first place great stretches of the floor of the forest had
been impoverished by reckless and excessive spoliation of
its litter. Matters had repeatedly gone so far that not only
the most recent carpet of needles and leaves, but the greatest
part of the fall of years past had been removed and used in
the fields partly as litter, partly as mould. There were many
forests which had been completely stripped of mould; some
had been crippled by the raking away of the litter: instances
of this were to be found in the public woodlands as well as
in the State woodlands.</p>

<p>If the woods had been put to these uses in order to tide
over a sudden agricultural crisis, there would have been no
reason to complain. But although there were not wanting
those who declared that an agricultural system founded on
the appropriation of wood-litter was inexpedient, indeed
dangerous, the trade in litter went on without any particular
reason, on purely fiscal grounds, so it was put&mdash;that
is to say, on grounds which, examined closely, proved to
be only one ground and object, namely, the making of
money. For it was money which was wanted. But to get
this money, ceaseless inroads were made on the capital, until
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
one fine day it was realised with dismay that an unsuspected
depreciation in that capital had ensued.</p>

<p>The people were a peasant race, and thought that the way
to be up-to-date was to display a perverted, artificial, and
improper zeal and to employ reckless business methods.
A characteristic instance was the dairy-farming &hellip; one
word about that. Loud complaints were heard, principally
in the official medical annual, that a deterioration was noticeable
in the nourishment, and consequently in the development,
of the country people. What was the reason? The
owners of cows were bent on turning all the full-milk at
their disposal into money. The spread of the dairy industry,
the development and productiveness of the milk trade, tempted
them to disregard the claims of their own establishments.
A strength-giving milk diet became a rarity in the country,
and in its stead recourse was had to unsubstantial skimmed
milk, inferior substitutes, vegetable oils, and, unfortunately,
alcoholic drinks as well. The critics talked about under-feeding,
they even called it physical and moral debilitation
of the population; they brought the facts to the notice of
the Diet, and the Government promised to give the matter
their earnest attention.</p>

<p>But it was only too clear that the Government was at
bottom infected with the same perversity as the mistaken
dairy-farmers. Timber continued to be cut to excess in the
State forests; once cut it was gone, and meant a continual
shrinkage of public property. The clearings might have been
necessary occasionally, when the forests had been damaged
in one way or another, but often enough they had been due
simply to the fiscal reasons referred to: and instead of the
proceeds of the clearings being used for the purchase of
new tracts, instead of the cleared tracts being replanted as
quickly as possible&mdash;instead, in a word, of the damage to
the capital value of the State forests being balanced by an
addition to their capital value, the quickly earned profits
had been devoted to the payment of current expenses and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
the redemption of bonds. Of course there could be no doubt
that a reduction of the National Debt was only too desirable;
but the critics expressed the opinion that that was not the time
to devote extraordinary revenues to the building up of the
sinking-fund.</p>

<p>Anybody who had no interest in mincing matters must
have described the State finances as in a hopeless muddle.
The country carried a debt of thirty million pounds&mdash;it
struggled along under it with patience and devotion, but with
secret groans. For the burden, much too heavy in itself,
was made trebly heavy through a rise in the rate of interest
and through conditions of repayment such as are usually
imposed on a country whose credit is shaken, whose exchange
is low, and which has already almost come to be
reckoned as &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; in the world of financiers.</p>

<p>The succession of financial crises appeared to be never-ending.
The list of failures seemed without beginning or
end. And a maladministration, which was made no better
by frequent changes in its personnel, regarded borrowing
as the only cure for the creeping sickness in the State finances.
Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer, von Schröder, whose
probity and singleness of purpose were beyond all doubt,
had been given a peerage by the Grand Duke, because he
had succeeded in placing a loan at a high rate of interest
in the most difficult circumstances. His heart was set on
an improvement in the credit of the State: but as his resource
was to contract new debts while he paid off the old, his
policy proved to be no better than a well-meant but costly
blind. For a simultaneous sale and purchase of bonds meant
a higher purchase than selling price, involving the loss of
thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the country were incapable of producing a
man of any adequate financial gifts. Improper practices
and a policy of &ldquo;hushing-up&rdquo; were the fashion. The
budget was so drawn up that it was impossible to distinguish
between ordinary and extraordinary State requirements.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
Ordinary and extraordinary items were jumbled up
together, and those responsible for the budgets deceived themselves,
and everybody else, as to the real state of affairs,
by appropriating loans, which were supposed to be raised
for extraordinary purposes, to cover a deficit in the ordinary
exchequer&hellip;. The holder of the finance portfolio at one
time was actually an ex-court marshal.</p>

<p>Dr. Krippenreuther, who took the helm towards the end
of Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III's reign, was the Minister who, convinced
like Herr von Schröder of the necessity for a strenuous
reduction in the debt, induced the Diet to consent to a
final and extreme addition to the burden of taxation. But
the country, naturally poor as it was, was on the verge of
insolvency, and all Krippenreuther got was unpopularity.
His policy really meant merely a transfer from one hand
to the other, a transfer which itself involved a loss; for
the increase in taxation laid a burden on the national economy
which pressed more heavily and more directly than that
which was removed by the sinking of the National Debt.</p>

<p>Where, then, were help and a remedy to be found? A
miracle, so it seemed, was needed&mdash;and meanwhile the sternest
economy. The people were pious and loyal, they loved
their princes as themselves, they were permeated with the
sublimity of the monarchical idea, they saw in it a reflexion
of the Deity. But the economical pressure was too
painful, too generally felt. The most ignorant could read
in the thinned and crippled forests a tale of woe. The consequence
was that repeated appeals had been made in the
Diet for a curtailment of the Civil List, a cutting down of
the appanages and Crown endowments.</p>

<p>The Civil List amounted to twenty-five thousand pounds,
the revenues of the Crown demesnes to thirty-seven thousand
pounds. That was all. And the Crown was in debt&mdash;to
what extent was perhaps known to Count Trümmerhauff,
the Keeper of the Grand Ducal Purse, a regular
stickler, but a man of absolutely no business instincts. It
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
was not known to Johann Albrecht; at any rate he seemed not
to know it, and therein followed the example of his forefathers,
who had rarely deigned to give more than a passing
thought to their debts.</p>

<p>The people's attitude of veneration was reflected in their
princes' extraordinary sense of their own dignity, which had
sometimes assumed fanciful and even extravagant forms, and
had found its most obvious and most serious expression in
every period in a tendency to extravagance and to a reckless
ostentation as exaggerated as the dignity it represented. One
Grimmburger had been christened &ldquo;the luxurious&rdquo; in so
many words,&mdash;they had almost all deserved the nickname. So
that the state of indebtedness of the House was an historical
and hereditary state, reaching back to the times when all
loans were a private concern of the Sovereign, and when
John the Headstrong, wishing to raise a loan, pledged the
liberty of the most prominent of his subjects to do so.</p>

<p>Those times were past; and Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III, a true-born
Grimmburger in his instincts, was unfortunately no
longer in a position to give free rein to his instincts. His
fathers had played ducks and drakes with the family funds,
which were reduced to nothing or little better than nothing.
They had been spent on the building of country-seats with
French names and marble colonnades, on parks with fountains,
on splendid operas and all kinds of glittering shows.
Figures were figures, and, much against the inclination of the
Grand Duke, in fact without his consent, the Court was gradually
cut down.</p>

<p>The Princess Catherine, the sister of the Grand Duke, was
never spoken of in the capital without a touch of sympathy.
She had been married to a member of a neighbouring ruling
House, had been left a widow, and had come back to her
brother's capital, where she lived with her red-headed children
in what used to be the Heir Apparent's palace on the Albrechtstrasse,
before whose gates a gigantic doorkeeper stood all
day long in a pompous attitude with staff and shoulder-belt
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
complete, while life went on with peculiar moderation inside.</p>

<p>Prince Lambert, the Grand Duke's brother, did not come in
for much attention. There was a coolness between him and
his relations, who could not forgive him his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i>, and
he hardly ever came to Court. He lived in his villa overlooking
the public gardens with his wife, an ex-dancer from
the Court Theatre who bore the title of Baroness von Rohrdorf,
after one of the Prince's properties; and there he divided his
time between sport and theatre-going, and struggling with his
debts. He had dropped his dignities and lived just like a
private citizen; and if he was generally supposed to have a
struggle to make two ends meet, nobody gave him much
sympathy for it.</p>

<p>But alterations had been made in the old castle itself&mdash;reductions
of expenses, which were discussed in the city and
the country, and discussed usually in an apprehensive and
regretful sense, because the people at bottom wished to see
themselves represented with due pride and magnificence.
Several high posts at the Court had been amalgamated for economy's
sake, and for years past Herr von Bühl zu Bühl had
been Lord Marshal, Chief Master of the Ceremonies, and
Marshal of the Household at once. There had been many
discharges in the Board of Green Cloth and the servants' hall,
among the pike-staffs, yeomen of the guard, and grooms, the
master cooks and chief confectioners, the court and chamber
lackeys. The establishment of the royal stable had been reduced
to the barest minimum&hellip;. And what was the good
of it all? The Grand Duke's contempt for money showed
itself in sudden outbursts against the squeeze; and while the
catering at the Court functions reached the extreme limits of
permissible simplicity, while at the supper at the close of
the Thursday concerts in the Marble Hall nothing but continual
roast beef with sauce remoulade and ice-pudding were served
on the red velvet coverings of the gilt-legged tables, while the
daily fare at the Grand Duke's own candle-decked table was
no better than that of an ordinary middle-class family, he defiantly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
threw away a whole year's income on the repair of the
Grimmburg.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the rest of his seats were falling to pieces.
Herr von Bühl simply had not the means at his disposal for
their upkeep. And yet it was a pity in the case of many of
them. Those which lay at some little distance from the capital,
or right out in the country, those luxurious asylums
cradled in natural beauties whose dainty names spoke of rest,
solitude, content, pastime, and freedom from care, or recalled
a flower or a jewel, served as holiday resorts for the citizens
and strangers, and brought in a certain amount in entrance-money
which sometimes&mdash;not always&mdash;was devoted to their
upkeep. This was not the case, however, with those in the
immediate neighbourhood of the capital. There was the little
schloss in the Empire style, the Hermitage, standing silent
and graceful on the edge of the northern suburbs, but long
uninhabited and deserted in the middle of its over-grown park,
which joined on to the public gardens, and looked out on its
little, mud-stiff pond. There was Schloss Delphinenort which,
only a quarter of an hour's walk from the other, in the
northern part of the public gardens themselves, all of which
had once belonged to the Crown, mirrored its untidiness in a
huge square fountain-basin; both were in a sad state. That
Delphinenort in particular&mdash;that noble structure in the early
baroque style, with its stately entrance-colonnade, its high
windows divided into little white-framed panes, its carved festoons,
its Roman busts in the niches, its splendid approach-stairs,
its general magnificence&mdash;should be abandoned to decay
for ever, as it seemed, was the sorrow of all lovers of architectural
beauty; and when one day, as the result of unforeseen,
really strange circumstances, it was restored to honour and
youth, among them at any rate the satisfaction was general&hellip;.
For the rest, Delphinenort could be reached in fifteen or
twenty minutes from the spa-garden, which lay a little to the
north-west of the city, and was connected with its centre by a
direct line of trams.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>The only residences used by the Grand Ducal family were
Schloss Hollerbrunn, the summer residence, an expanse of
white buildings with Chinese roofs, on the farther side of the
chain of hills which surrounded the capital, coolly and
pleasantly situated on the river and famed for the elder-hedges
in its park; farther, Schloss Jägerpreis, the ivy-covered
hunting-box in the middle of the woods to westward; and
lastly, the Town Castle itself, called the &ldquo;Old&rdquo; Castle, although
no new one existed.</p>

<p>It was called thus, with no idea of comparison, simply because
of its age, and the critics declared that its redecoration
was more a matter of urgency than that of the Grimmburg.
Even the inner rooms, which were in daily use by the family,
were faded and cracked, not to mention the many uninhabited
and unused rooms in the oldest parts of the many-styled building,
which were all choked and flyblown. For some time past
the public had been refused admission to them,&mdash;a measure
which was obviously due to the shocking state of the castle.
But people who could get a peep, the tradesmen and the staff,
declared that there was stuffing peeping out of more than one
stiff, imposing piece of furniture.</p>

<p>The castle and the Court Church together made up a grey,
irregular, and commanding mass of turrets, galleries, and
gateways, half fortress, half palace. Various epochs had contributed
to its erection, and large parts of it were decaying,
weather-beaten, spoilt, and ready to fall into pieces. To the
west it dropped steeply down to the lower-lying city, and was
connected with it by battered steps clamped together with
rusty iron bars. But the huge main gate, guarded by lions
couchant, and surmounted by the pious, haughty motto:
&ldquo;Turris fortissima nomen Domini,&rdquo; in almost illegible carving,
faced the Albrechtsplatz. It had its sentries and sentry
boxes; it was the scene of the changing of the guard, with
drums and martial display; it was the playground of all the
urchins of the town.</p>

<p>The Old Castle had three courtyards, in the corners of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
which rose graceful stair-turrets and between whose paving
stones an unnecessary amount of weeds was generally growing.
But in the middle of one of the courtyards stood the
rose-bush,&mdash;it had stood there for ages in a bed, although
there was no other attempt at a garden to be seen. It was
just like any other rose-bush; it had a porter to tend it, it
stood there in snow, rain, and sunshine, and in due season
it bore roses. These were exceptionally fine roses, nobly
formed, with dark-red velvet petals, a pleasure to look at,
and real masterpieces of nature. But those roses had one
strange and dreadful peculiarity: they had no scent! Or
rather, they had a scent, but for some unknown reason it
was not the scent of roses, but of decay&mdash;a slight, but plainly
perceptible scent of decay. Everybody knew it; it was in the
guide-books, and strangers visited the courtyard to convince
themselves of it with their own noses. There was also a
popular idea that it was written somewhere that at some time
or other, on a day of rejoicings and public felicity, the blossoms
of the rose-bush would begin to give forth a natural
and lovely odour.</p>

<p>After all, it was only to be expected that the popular
imagination would be exercised by the wonderful rose-bush.
It was exercised in precisely the same way by the &ldquo;owl-chamber&rdquo;
in the Old Castle, which was used as a lumber
room. Its position was such that it could not be ignored,
not far from the &ldquo;Gala Rooms,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hall of the
Knights,&rdquo; where the Court officers used to assemble on Court
days, and thus in a comparatively modern part of the building.
But there was certainly something uncanny about it,
especially as from time to time noises and cries occurred
there, which could not be heard outside the room and whose
origin was unascertainable. People swore that it came from
ghosts, and many asserted that it was especially noticeable
when important and decisive events in the Grand Ducal family
were impending,&mdash;a more or less gratuitous rumour, which
deserved no more serious attention than other national products
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
of an historical and dynastic frame of mind, as for
instance a certain dark prophecy which had been handed
down for hundreds of years and may be mentioned in this
connexion. It came from an old gipsy-woman, and was to
the effect that a prince &ldquo;with one hand&rdquo; would bring the
greatest good fortune to the country. The old hag had said:
&ldquo;He will give to the country with one hand more than all
the rest could give it with two.&rdquo; That is how the prophecy
was recorded, and how it was quoted from time to time.</p>

<p>Round the Old Castle lay the capital, consisting of the
Old Town and the New Town, with their public buildings,
monuments, fountains, and parks, their streets and squares,
named after princes, artists, deserving statesmen, and distinguished
citizens, divided into two very unequal halves
by the many-bridged river, which flowed in a great loop round
the southern end of the public garden, and was lost in the
surrounding hills. The city was a university town, it possessed
an academy which was not in much request and whose
curricula were unpractical and rather old-fashioned; the Professor
of Mathematics, Privy Councillor Klinghammer, was
the only one of any particular repute in the scientific world.
The Court Theatre, though poorly endowed, maintained a
decent level of performances. There was a little musical,
literary, and artistic life; a certain number of foreigners came
to the capital, wishing to share in its well-regulated life and
such intellectual attractions as it offered, among them wealthy
invalids who settled down in the villas round the spa-gardens
and were held in honour by the State and the community
as doughty payers of taxes.</p>

<p>And now you know what the town was like, what the country
was like, and how matters stood.</p>

<small>HINNERKE THE SHOEMAKER</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">The</span> Grand Duke's second son made his first public appearance
on the occasion of his christening. This festivity aroused
the same interest in the country as always attached to happenings
within the Royal Family circle. It took place after
weeks of discussion and research as to the manner of its
arrangement, was held in the Court Church by the President
of the High Consistory, Dom Wislezenus, with all the due
ceremonial, and in public, to the extent that the Lord Marshal's
office, by the Prince's orders, had issued invitations to it
to every class of society.</p>

<p>Herr von Bühl zu Bühl, a courtly ritualist of the greatest
circumspection and accuracy, in his full-dress uniform
superintended, with the help of two masters of the ceremonies,
the whole of the intricate proceedings: the gathering
of the princely guests in the Gala Rooms, the solemn
procession in which they, attended by pages and squires,
walked up the staircase of Heinrich the Luxurious and through
a covered passage into the church, the entry of the spectators
from the highest to the lowest, the distribution of the seats,
the observance of due decorum during the religious service
itself, the order of precedence at the congratulations which
took place directly after the service was ended&hellip;. He
panted and puffed, smiled ingratiatingly, brandished his staff,
laughed in nervous bursts, and kept executing retreating
bows.</p>

<p>The Court Church was decorated with plants and draperies.
In addition to the representatives of the nobility,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
of the Court and country, and of the higher and lower Civil
Service, tradesmen, country folk, and common artisans, in
high good humour, filled the seats. But in a half-circle
of red-velvet arm-chairs in front of the altar sat the relations
of the infant, foreign princes as sponsors and the
trusty representatives of such as had not come in person.
The assemblage at the christening of the Heir Apparent six
years before had not been more distinguished. For in view
of Albrecht's delicacy, the advanced age of the Grand Duke,
and the dearth of Grimmburg relations, the person of the
second-born prince was at once recognized as an important
guarantee for the future of the dynasty. Little Albrecht took
no part in the ceremony; he was kept to his bed with an
indisposition which Surgeon-General Eschrich declared to be
of a nervous character.</p>

<p>Dom Wislezenus preached from a text of the Grand Duke's
own choosing. The <i>Courier</i>, a gossiping city newspaper, had
given a full account of how the Grand Duke had one day
fetched with his very own hands the large metal-clasped
family Bible out of the rarely visited library, had shut himself
up with it in his study, searched in it for a whole hour,
at last copied the text he had chosen on to a piece of paper
with his pocket-pencil, signed it &ldquo;Johann Albrecht,&rdquo; and sent
it to the Court preacher. Dom Wislezenus treated it in a
musical style, so as to speak, like a <i>leit motif</i>. He turned it inside
and out, dressed it in different shapes and squeezed it dry;
he announced it in a whisper, then with the whole power of
his lungs; and whereas, delivered lightly and reflectively at
the beginning of his discourse, it seemed a thin, almost unsubstantial
subject; at the close, when he for the last time
thundered it at the congregation, it appeared richly orchestrated,
heavily scored, and pregnant with emotion. Then he
passed on to the actual baptism, and carried it out at full
length so that all could see it, with due stress on every detail.</p>

<p>This, then, was the day of the prince's first public appearance,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
and that he was the chief actor in the drama was
clearly shown by the fact that he was the last to come on
the stage, and that his entry was distinct from that of the
rest of the company. Preceded by Herr von Bühl, he entered
slowly, in the arms of the Mistress of the Robes, Baroness
von Schulenburg-Tressen, and all eyes were fixed on him.
He was asleep in his laces, his veils, and his white silk robe.
One of his little hands happened to be hidden. His appearance
evoked unusual delight and emotion. The cynosure
and centre of attraction, he lay quietly there, bearing it all,
as may be supposed, patiently and unassumingly. It was
to his credit that he did not make any disturbance, did not
clutch or struggle; but, doubtless from innate trustfulness,
quietly resigned himself to the state which surrounded him,
bore it patiently, and even at that early date sank his own
emotions in it&hellip;.</p>

<p>The arms in which he reposed were frequently changed
at fixed points in the ceremony. Baroness Schulenburg
handed him with a curtsey to his aunt, Catherine, who, with
a stern look on her face, was dressed in a newly remade
lilac silk dress, and wore Crown jewels in her hair. She
laid him, when the moment came, solemnly in his mother
Dorothea's arms, who, in all her stately beauty, with a smile
on her proud and lovely mouth, held him out a while to
be blessed, and then passed him on. A cousin held him for
a minute or two, a child of eleven or twelve years with fair
hair, thin sticks of legs, cold bare arms, and a broad red
silk sash which stuck out in a huge knot behind her white
dress. Her peaked face was anxiously fixed on the Master
of the Ceremonies&hellip;.</p>

<p>Once the Prince woke up, but the flickering flames of the
altar-candles and a many-coloured shaft of sunlight dust
blinded him, and made him close his eyes again. And as
there were no thoughts, but only soft unsubstantial dreams
in his head, as moreover he was feeling no pain at the moment,
he at once fell asleep again.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>He received a number of names while he slept; but the
chief names were Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>And he slept on in his cot with its gilded cornice and
blue silk curtains, while the royal family feasted in the
Marble Hall, and the rest of the guests in the Hall of the
Knights, in his honour.</p>

<p>The newspapers reported his first appearance; they described
his looks and his dress, and emphasized his truly
princely behaviour, couching the moving and inspiring account
in words which had often done duty on similar
occasions. After that, the public for a long time heard little
of him, and he nothing of them.</p>

<p>He knew nothing as yet, understood nothing as yet,
guessed nothing as to the difficulty, danger, and sternness of
the life prescribed for him; nothing in his conduct suggested
that he felt any contrast between himself and the
great public. His little existence was an irresponsible, carefully
supervised dream, played on a stage remote from the
public stage; and this stage was peopled with countless
tinted phantoms, both stationary and active, some emerging
but transiently, some permanently at hand.</p>

<p>Of the permanent ones, the parents were far in the back-ground,
and not altogether distinguishable. They were his
parents, that was certain, and they were exalted, and friendly
too. When they approached there was a feeling as if everything
else slipped away to each side, and left a respectable
passage along which they advanced towards him to show
him a moment's tenderness. The nearest and clearest things
to him were two women with white caps and aprons, two
beings who were obviously all goodness, purity, and loving-kindness,
who tended his little body in every way, and were
much distressed when he cried&hellip;. A close partner in his
life, too, was Albrecht, his brother; but he was grave, distant,
and much more advanced.</p>

<p>When Klaus Heinrich was two years old, another birth
took place in the Grimmburg, and a princess came into the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
world. Thirty-six guns were allotted to her, because she
was of the female sex, and she was given the name of Ditlinde
at the font. She was Klaus Heinrich's sister, and it
was a good thing for him that she appeared. She was at
first surprisingly small and weak, but she soon grew like
him, caught him up, and the two became inseparable. They
shared each other's lives, each other's views, feelings, and
ideas: they communicated to each other their impressions of
the world outside them.</p>

<p>It was a world, they were impressions, calculated to produce
a reflective frame of mind. In winter they lived in the
old castle. In summer they lived in Hollerbrunn, the summer
schloss, on the river, in the cool, in the scent of the
violet hedges with white statues between them. On the way
thither, or if at any other time father or mother took them with
them in one of the brown carriages with the little golden
crown on the door, all the passers-by stopped, cheered,
and took their hats off; for father was Prince and Ruler
of the country, consequently they themselves were Prince
and Princess&mdash;undoubtedly in precisely the same sense as
were the princes and princesses in the French stories which
their Swiss governess told them. That was worth consideration,
it was at any rate a peculiar occurrence. When
other children heard the stories, they necessarily regarded
the princes which figured in them from a great distance, and
as solemn beings whose rank was a glorification of reality
and with whom to concern themselves was undoubtedly a
chastening of their thoughts, and an escape from the ordinary
existence. But Klaus Heinrich and Ditlinde regarded the
heroes of the stories as their own equals and fellows, they
breathed the same air as them, they lived in a schloss like them,
they stood on a fraternal footing with them, and were justified
in identifying themselves with them. Was it their lot, then,
to live always and continually on the height to which others
only climbed when stories were being told to them? The
Swiss governess, true to her general principles, would have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
found it impossible to deny it, if the children had asked the
question in so many words.</p>

<p>The Swiss governess was the widow of a <ins title="Calvanistic">Calvinistic</ins> minister
and was in charge of both children, each of whom had
two lady's maids as well. She was black and white throughout:
her cap was white and her dress black, her face was
white, with white warts on one cheek, and her smooth hair
had a mixed black-and-white metallic sheen. She was very
precise and easily put out. When things happened which,
though quite without danger, could not be allowed, she
clasped her white hands and turned her eyes up to heaven.
But her quietest and severest mode of punishment for serious
occasions was to &ldquo;look sadly&rdquo; at the children&mdash;implying that
they had lost their self-respect. On a fixed day she began,
on a hint from higher quarters, to address Klaus Heinrich
and Ditlinde as &ldquo;Grand Ducal Highness,&rdquo; and from that day
she was more easily put out than before&hellip;.</p>

<p>But Albrecht was called &ldquo;Royal Highness.&rdquo; Aunt Catherine's
children were members of the family only on the
distaff side, and so were of less importance. But Albrecht
was Crown Prince and Heir Apparent, so that it was not
at all unfitting that he should look so pale and distant and
keep so much to his bed. He wore Austrian coats with
flap pockets and cut long behind. His head had a big
bump at the back and narrow temples, and he had a long
face. While still quite young he had come through a serious
illness, which, in the opinion of Surgeon-General Eschrich,
was the reason for his heart having &ldquo;shifted over to the
right.&rdquo; However that might be, he had seen Death face to
face, a fact which had probably intensified the shy dignity
which was natural to him. He seemed to be extremely standoffish,
cold from embarrassment, and proud from lack of
graciousness. He lisped a little and then blushed at doing
so, because he was always criticizing himself. His shoulder-blades
were a little uneven. One of his eyes had some weakness
or other, so that he used glasses for writing his exercises,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
which helped to make him look old and wise&hellip;. Albrecht's
tutor, Doctor Veit, a man with hanging mud-coloured moustaches,
hollow cheeks, and wan eyes unnaturally far apart,
was always at his left hand. Doctor Veit was always dressed
in black, and carried a book dangling down his thigh, with
his index-finger thrust between its leaves.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich felt that Albrecht did not care much for
him, and he saw that it was not only because of his inferiority
in years. He himself was tender-hearted and prone to tears,
that was his nature. He cried, when anybody &ldquo;looked
sadly&rdquo; at him, and when he knocked his forehead against
a corner of the nursery table, so that it bled, he howled from
sympathy with his forehead. But Albrecht had faced Death,
yet never cried on any condition. He stuck his short,
rounded underlip a little forward, and sucked it lightly against
the upper one&mdash;that was all. He was most superior. The
Swiss governess referred in so many words to him in matters
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i> as a model. He had never allowed himself
to converse with the gorgeous creatures who belonged
to the court, not exactly men and human beings, but
lackeys&mdash;as Klaus Heinrich had sometimes done in unguarded
moments. For Albrecht was not curious. The look in his
eyes was that of a lonely boy, who had no wish to let the
world intrude upon him. Klaus Heinrich, on the contrary,
chatted with the lackeys from that same wish, and from
an urgent though perhaps dangerous and improper desire
to feel some contact with what lay outside the charmed
circle. But the lackeys, young and old, at the doors, in
the corridors and the passage-rooms, with their sand-coloured
gaiters and brown coats, on the red-gold lace of
which the same little crown as on the carriage doors was
repeated again and again&mdash;they straightened their knees when
Klaus Heinrich chatted to them, laid their great hands on
the seams of the thick velvet breeches, bent a little forward
towards him, so that the aiguillettes dangled from their
shoulders, and returned various, highly proper answers, the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
most important part of which was the address &ldquo;Grand Ducal
Highness,&rdquo; and smiled as they did so with an expression
of cautious sympathy, which recalled the words of the old
song, &ldquo;The lad that is born to be king.&rdquo; Sometimes when
he got the chance, Klaus Heinrich went on voyages of discovery
in uninhabited parts of the schloss, with Ditlinde, his
sister, when she was old enough.</p>

<p>At that time he was having lessons from Schulrat Dröge,
Rector of the city schools, who was chosen to be his first
tutor. Schulrat Dröge was a born pedagogue. His index-finger,
with its folds of dry skin and gold stoneless signet-ring,
followed the line of print when Klaus Heinrich read,
waiting before going on to the next word until the preceding
one had been read. He came in a frock-coat and white
waistcoat, with the ribbon of some inferior order in his
button-hole, and in broad shiny boots with brown upper-leathers.
He wore a pointed grey beard, and bushy grey
hair grew out of his big, broad ears. His brown hair was
brushed up into points on his temples, and so precisely parted
as to show clearly his yellow dry scalp, which was full of
holes like canvas. But thin grey hair was visible under the
strong brown hair behind and at the sides. He bowed slightly
to the lackeys who opened the door for him to the big
schoolroom at whose table Klaus Heinrich sat waiting for
him. But to Klaus Heinrich he did not confine himself
to a superficial bow as he entered the room, but made a pronounced
and deliberate bow before he came up to him,
and waited for his exalted pupil to offer him his hand. This
Klaus Heinrich did; and the fact that he did so twice, not
only when he greeted him, but also when he took his departure,
just in the graceful and winning way in which he
had seen his father give his hand to those who expected it,
seemed to him far more important and essential than all
the instruction which came between the two ceremonies.</p>

<p>After Schulrat Dröge had come and gone any number
of times, Klaus Heinrich had imperceptibly gained a knowledge
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
of all sorts of practical things: to everybody's surprise
he was quite at home in every kind of reading, writing, and
arithmetic, and could reel off to order the names of the
towns in the Grand Duchy pretty well without an omission.
But, as has been said, this was not what was in his opinion
really necessary and essential for him. From time to time,
when he was inattentive at his lessons, the Schulrat rebuked
him with a reference to his exalted calling. &ldquo;Your exalted
calling requires you&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; he would say or: &ldquo;You owe it
to your exalted calling&hellip;.&rdquo; What was his calling, and how
was it exalted? Why did the lackeys smile as if to say,
&ldquo;The lad that is born to be king,&rdquo; and why was his governess
so much put out when he let himself go a little in speech
or action? He looked round him, and at times, when he
looked steadily and long and forced himself to probe the
essence of the phenomena around him, a dim apprehension
arose in him of the &ldquo;aloofness&rdquo; of his position.</p>

<p>He was standing in one of the &ldquo;gala rooms,&rdquo; the Silver
Hall, in which, as he knew, his father the Grand Duke received
solemn deputations&mdash;he happened to have wandered
into it by himself and he took stock of his surroundings.</p>

<p>It was winter-time and cold, his little shoes were reflected
in the glass-clear yellow squares of the parquet which spread
like a sheet of ice before him. The ceiling, covered with
silvered arabesque-work, was so high that a long metal shaft
was necessary to allow the many-armed silver chandelier
with its forest of tall white candles to swing in the middle
of the great space. Below the ceiling came silver-framed
coats-of-arms in faded colours. The walls were edged with
silver, and hung with white silk with yellow spots, not to
mention a split here and there. A sort of monumental
baldachin, resting on two strong silver columns and decorated
in front with a silver garland, broken in two places, from
the top of which looked down a portrait of a deceased, powdered
ancestress draped in imitation ermine, formed the
chimney-piece. On each side of the fireplace were broad
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
silvered arm-chairs upholstered in torn white silk. On the
side walls opposite each other towered enormous silver-framed
mirrors, whose glass was covered with blind spots, and on
each side of whose broad white marble ledges stood two
candelabra which carried big white candles like the sconces
on the walls all round, and like the four silver candlesticks
which stood in the corners. Before the high windows to
the right, looking over the Albrechtsplatz, whose outer ledges
were covered with snow, white silk curtains, yellow spotted,
with silver cords and trimmed with lace, fell in rich, and
heavy folds to the floor. In the middle of the room, under
the chandelier, a moderate-sized table, with a pedestal made
like a knobby silver tree-stump and a top made of eight
triangles of opaque mother-of-pearl, stood useless, as there
were no chairs round it, and it could only serve, and be meant
to serve, at the very best, as a support for your Highness,
when the lackeys opened the doors and ushered in the solemn
figures in Court dress who came to present their respects to
you&hellip;.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked round the hall, and clearly saw
that there was nothing here which reminded him of the realities
which Schulrat Dröge, for all his bows, was always impressing
upon him. Here all was Sunday and solemnity,
just as in church, where also he would have felt the calls
made on him by his tutor out of place. Everything here
was severe and empty show and a formal symmetry, self-sufficient,
pointless, and uncomfortable&mdash;whose functions
were obviously to create an atmosphere of awe and tension,
not of freedom and ease, to inculcate an attitude of decorum
and discreet self-obliteration towards an unnamed object.
And it was cold in the silver hall&mdash;cold as in the halls of the
snow-king, where the children's hearts froze stiff.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich walked over the glassy floor and stood
at the table in the middle. He laid his right hand lightly
on the mother-of-pearl table, and placed the left hand on his
hip, so far behind that it rested almost in the small of his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
back, and was not visible from in front, for it was an ugly
sight, brown and wrinkled, and had not kept pace with the
right in its growth. He stood resting on one leg, with the
other a little advanced, and kept his eyes fixed on the silver
ornaments of the door. It was not the place nor the attitude
for dreaming, and yet he dreamed.</p>

<p>He saw his father, and looked at him as he looked at
the hall, to try to grasp his meaning. He saw the dull
haughtiness of his blue eyes, the furrows which, proudly
and morosely, ran from nostril down to his beard, and
were often deepened or accentuated by weariness and boredom&hellip;.
Nobody dared to address him or to go freely up
to him and speak to him unasked&mdash;not even the children:
it was forbidden, it was dangerous. He answered, it is true:
but he answered distantly and coldly, a look of helplessness,
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gêne</i>, passed over his face, which Klaus Heinrich was quite
able to understand.</p>

<p>Papa made a speech and sent his petitioners away; that
is what always happened. He gave an audience at the beginning
of the Court ball, and at the end of the dinner
with which the winter began. He went with mamma through
the rooms and halls, in which the members of the Court
were gathered, went through the Marble Hall and the Gala
Rooms, through the Picture Gallery, the Hall of the Knights,
the Hall of the Twelve Months, the Audience Chamber, and
the Ball-room&mdash;went not only in a fixed direction, but along
a fixed path which bustling Herr von Bühl kept free for him,
and addressed a few words to the assembled throng. Whoever
was addressed by him bowed low, left a space of parquet
between himself and papa, and answered soberly and
with signs of gratification. Thereupon papa greeted them over
the intervening space, from the stronghold of precise regulations
which prescribed the others' movements and warranted
his own attitude, greeted them smilingly and lightly and
passed on. Smilingly and lightly&hellip;. Of course, of course,
Klaus Heinrich quite understood it, the look of helplessness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
which passed for one moment over papa's face when anybody
was impetuous enough to address him unasked&mdash;understood
it, and shared his feeling of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gêne</i>! It wounded something,
some soft, virgin envelope of our existence which was so
essential to it that we stood helpless when anybody roughly
broke through it. And yet it was this same something which
made our eyes so dull, and gave us those deep furrows of
boredom&hellip;.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich stood and saw&mdash;he saw his mother and her
beauty, which was famed and extolled far and wide. He
saw her standing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en robe de ceremonie</i>, in front of her great
candle-lighted glass, for sometimes, on solemn occasions,
he was allowed to be present when the Court hairdresser
and the bed-chamber women put the last touches to her
toilette. Herr von Knobelsdorff also was present when
mamma put on jewels from the Crown regalia, watched and
noted down the stones which she decided to use. With all
the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes showing, he would
make mamma laugh with his droll remarks, so that her
soft cheeks filled with lovely little dimples. But her laugh
was full of art and grace, and she looked in the glass as she
laughed, as if she were practising it.</p>

<p>People said that Slav blood flowed in her veins, and
that it was that which gave the sweet radiance to her deep-blue
eyes and the night of her raven hair. Klaus Heinrich
was like her, so he heard people say, in that he too had
steel-blue eyes with dark hair, while Albrecht and Ditlinde
were fair, just as papa had been before his hair turned
grey. But he was far from handsome, owing to the breadth
of his cheek-bones, and especially to his left hand, which
mamma was always reminding him to hide adroitly, in the
side-pocket of his coat, behind his back, or under the breast
of his jacket&mdash;especially when his affectionate impulses
prompted him to throw both his arms round her. Her look
was cold when she bade him mind his hand.</p>

<p>He saw her as she was in the picture in the Marble Hall:
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
in a short silk dress with lace flounces and long gloves,
which showed only a glimpse of her ivory arm under her
puffed sleeves, a diadem in the night of her hair, her stately
form erect, a smile of cool perfection on her strangely hard
lips&mdash;and behind her the metallic-blue wheel of a peacock's
tail. Her face was soft, but its beauty made it stern, and
it was easy to see that her heart too was stern and absorbed
in her beauty. She slept far into the day when a ball or
party was in prospect, and ate only yolks of eggs, so as
not to overload herself. Then in the evening she was radiant
as she walked on papa's arm along the prescribed path through
the halls&mdash;grey-haired dignitaries blushed when they were
addressed by her, and the <i>Courier</i> reported that it was not
only because of her exalted rank that her Royal Highness
had been the queen of the ball. Yes, people felt happier
for the sight of her, whether it was at the Court or outside
in the streets, or in the afternoon driving or riding in the
park&mdash;and their cheeks kindled. Flowers and cheers met
her, all hearts went out to her, and it was clear that the people
in cheering her were cheering themselves, and that their
glad cries meant that they were cheered and elevated by the
sight of her. But Klaus Heinrich knew well that mamma
had spent long, anxious hours on her beauty, that there was
practice and method in her smiles and greetings, and that
her own pulse beat never the quicker for anything or anyone.</p>

<p>Did she love anyone&mdash;himself, Klaus Heinrich, for instance,
for all his likeness to her? Why, of course she did, when
she had time to, even when she coldly reminded him of
his hand. But it seemed as if she reserved any expression
or sign of her tender feelings for occasions when lookers-on
were present who were likely to be edified by them.
Klaus Heinrich and Ditlinde did not often come into contact
with their mother, chiefly because they, unlike Albrecht,
the Heir Apparent, for some time past, did not have their
meals at their parents' table, but apart with the Swiss
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
governess; and when they were summoned to mamma's
boudoir, which happened once a week, the interview consisted
in a few casual questions and polite answers&mdash;giving
no scope for displays of feeling, while its whole drift seemed
to be the proper way to sit in an arm-chair with a teacup full
of milk.</p>

<p>But at the concerts which took place in the Marble Hall
every other Thursday under the name of &ldquo;The Grand
Duchess's Thursdays,&rdquo; and were so arranged that the Court
sat at little gilt-legged velvet-covered tables, while the leading
tenor Schramm from the Court Theatre, accompanied by
an orchestra, sang so lustily that the veins swelled on his
bald temples&mdash;at the concerts Klaus Heinrich and Ditlinde,
in their best clothes, were sometimes allowed in the Hall
for one song and the succeeding pause, when mamma showed
how fond she was of them, showed it to them and to everybody
else in so heartfelt and expressive a way that nobody
could have any doubt about it. She summoned them to the
table at which she sat, and told them with a happy smile
to sit beside her, laid their cheeks on her shoulders or bosom,
looked at them with a soft, soulful look in her eyes and
kissed them both on forehead and mouth. Then the ladies
bent their heads and their eyelids quivered, while the men
slowly nodded and bit their lips in order, in manly wise,
to restrain their emotions&hellip;. Yes, it was beautiful, and
the children felt they had their share in the effect, which was
greater than anything Schramm the singer could procure
with his most inspired notes, and nestled close to mamma.
For Klaus Heinrich at last realized that it was in the nature
of things, no business of ours, to have a simple feeling and
to be made happy by it, but that it was our duty to make
our tenderness visible to the Hall and to exhibit it, that the
hearts of our guests might swell.</p>

<p>Occasionally the people outside in the town and park also
were allowed to see that mamma loved us. For while Albrecht
drove or rode&mdash;bad rider though he was&mdash;with the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
Grand Duke early in the morning, Klaus Heinrich and
Ditlinde had from time to time to take turns at accompanying
mamma on her drives, which took place in the spring
and autumn at the time of the afternoon promenade, with
Baroness von Schulenburg-Tressen in attendance. Klaus
Heinrich was a little excited and feverish before these drives,
to which unfortunately no enjoyment, but on the contrary
a great deal of trouble and effort attached. For, directly
the open carriage came out through the Lions Gate on to
the Albrechtsplatz, past the grenadiers at the &ldquo;present,&rdquo; there
were a lot of people collected, waiting for it&mdash;men, women,
and children, who shouted and stared full of curiosity; and
that meant pulling oneself together, sitting up erect, smiling,
hiding the left hand, and saluting in such a way as to make
the people happy. And so it went on right through the
city and the fields. Other vehicles were obliged to keep
away from ours; the police looked to that. But the foot-passengers
stood on the kerb, the women curtseyed, the men
took off their hats and looked with eyes full of devotion
and importunate curiosity,&mdash;and this was the impression
Klaus Heinrich got: that they all were there just to be there
and to stare, while he was there to show himself and to
be stared at; and his was far the harder part. He kept his
left hand in his coat-pocket and smiled as mamma wished
him to, while he felt that his cheeks were aglow. But the
<i>Courier</i> reported that the rosy redness of our little duke's
cheeks showed what a healthy boy he was.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was thirteen years old when he stood at
the solitary mother-of-pearl table in the middle of the cold
silver hall, and tried to probe the reality of things around
him. And as he scrutinized the various phenomena: the
empty, torn pride of the room, aimless and uncomfortable,
the symmetry of the white candles, which seemed to express
awe and tension and discreet self-obliteration, the passing
shadow on his father's face when anybody addressed him
unasked, the cool and calculated beauty of his mother, whose
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
one object was admiration, the devoted and importunately
curious gaze of the people outside&mdash;then a suspicion seized
him, a vague and approximate conception of his situation.
But simultaneously horror seized him, terror at such a destiny,
a dread of his &ldquo;exalted calling,&rdquo; so strong that he turned
round and covered his eyes with both his hands&mdash;both, the little
wrinkled left one too&mdash;and sank down at the lonely table and
cried, cried from sympathy with himself and his heart&mdash;till
they came, and wrung their hands and turned their eyes
up to heaven and questioned him, and led him away&hellip;.
He gave out that he had been frightened, and that was quite
true.</p>

<p>He had known nothing, understood nothing, suspected
nothing of the difficulty and sternness of the life prescribed
for him; he had been merry and careless, and had given
his guardians many a scare. But there was no resisting the
impressions which soon came thronging upon him and forcing
him to open his eyes to the real state of things. In
the northern suburbs, not far from the spa-gardens, a new
road had been opened: people told him that the City Council
had decided to call it &ldquo;Klaus Heinrich Strasse.&rdquo; Once when
driving out with his mother and he called at a picture-dealer's,
they wanted to buy something. The footman waited at the
carriage door, the public gathered round, the picture-dealer
bustled about&mdash;there was nothing new in all that. But Klaus
Heinrich for the first time noticed his photograph in the shop
window. It was hanging next those of artists and great men,
men with lofty brows, with a look of the loneliness of
fame in their eyes.</p>

<p>People were satisfied with him on the whole. He gained
dignity with years, and self-possession under the pressure
of his exalted calling. But the strange thing was that his
longing increased at the same time: that roving inquisitiveness
which Schulrat Dröge was not the man to satisfy, and
which had impelled him to chat with the lackeys. He had
given up doing that; it did not lead to anything. They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
smiled at him, confirming him by that very laugh in the
suspicion that his world of the symmetrically marshalled
candles presented an unconscious antithesis to the world
outside, but they were no manner of help to him. He looked
round about him on the expeditions, in the walks he took
through the town gardens with Ditlinde and the Swiss governess,
followed by a lackey. He felt that if they were all
of one mind to stare at him, while he was all alone and
made conspicuous just to be stared at, he also had no share
in their being and doing. He realized that they presumably
were not always as he saw them, when they stood and
greeted him with deferential looks; that it must be his birth
and upbringing which made their looks deferential, and that
it was with them as with the children when they heard about
fairy princes, and were thereby refined and elevated above
their work-a-day selves. But he did not know what they
looked like and were when they were not refined and elevated
above their work-a-day selves&mdash;his &ldquo;exalted calling&rdquo; concealed
this from him, and it was a dangerous and improper
wish to allow his heart to be moved by things which his
exaltedness concealed from him. And yet he wished it, he
wished it from a jealousy and that roving inquisitiveness
which sometimes drove him to undertake voyages of exploration
into unknown regions of the old Schloss, with Ditlinde
his sister, when the opportunity offered.</p>

<p>They called it &ldquo;rummaging,&rdquo; and great was the charm of
&ldquo;rummaging&rdquo;; for it was difficult to acquire familiarity with
the ground-plan and structure of the old Schloss, and every
time they penetrated far enough into the remoter parts they
found rooms, closets, and empty halls which they had not
yet trodden, or strange round-about ways to already-known
rooms. But once when thus wandering about they had a
rencontre, an adventure befell them, which made a great impression
on Klaus Heinrich, though he did not show it, and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The opportunity came. While the Swiss <ins title="governness">governess</ins> was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
absent on leave to attend the evening service, they had drunk
their milk from tea-cups with the Grand Duchess, accompanied
by the two ladies-in-waiting, had been dismissed and directed
to go back hand-in-hand to their ordinary occupations
in the nursery, which lay not far off. It was thought
that they needed nobody to go with them; Klaus Heinrich
was old enough to take care of Ditlinde, of course. He was;
and in the corridor he said: &ldquo;Yes, Ditlinde, we will certainly
go back to the nursery, but we need not go, you
know, the shortest, dullest way. We'll rummage a bit first.
If you go up one step and follow the corridor as far as
where the arches begin, you'll find a hall with pillars behind
them, and if you go out of one of the doors of the
hall with pillars&mdash;clamber up the corkscrew staircase, you
come to a room with a wooden roof; and there are lots of
funny things lying about there. But I don't know what
comes after the room, and that's what we've got to find out.
So let's go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let's,&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;but not too far, Klaus Heinrich,
and not where it's too dusty, for this dress shows <ins title="everything.">everything.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>She was wearing a dress of dark-red velvet, trimmed with
satin of the same colour. She had at that time dimples in
her elbows, and light golden hair, that curled round her
ears like ram's horns. In after years she was pale and
thin. She too had the broad, rather over-prominent cheek-bones
of her father and nation, but they were not accentuated,
so that they did not spoil the lines of her face. But
with Klaus Heinrich they were strong and emphatic, so
that they seemed somewhat to encroach upon, to narrow and
to lengthen his steel-coloured eyes. His dark hair was
smoothly parted, cut in a careful rectangle on the temples,
and brushed straight back from the forehead. He wore
an open jacket with a waistcoat buttoning at the throat and
a white turn-down collar. In his right hand he held Ditlinde's
little hand, but his left arm hung down, with its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>
brown, wrinkled, and undeveloped hand, thin and short from
the shoulder. He was glad that he could let it hang without
bothering to conceal it; for there was nobody there to
stare and to require to be elevated and inspired, and he
himself might stare and examine to his heart's content.</p>

<p>So they went and rummaged as they liked. Quiet reigned
in the corridors, and they saw hardly a lackey in the distance.
They climbed up a staircase and followed the passage
till they came to the arches, showing that they were
in the part of the Schloss which dated from the time of
John the Headstrong and Heinrich the Confessor, as Klaus
Heinrich knew and explained. They came to the hall of
the pillars, and Klaus Heinrich there whistled several notes
close after each other, for the first were still sounding when
the last came, and so a clear chord rang under the vaulted
ceiling. They scrambled groping and often on hands and
knees up the stone winding staircase which opened behind
one of the heavy doors, and reached the room with the
wooden ceiling, in which there were several strange objects.
There were some broken muskets of clumsy size with thickly
rusted locks, which had been too bad for the museum, and
a discarded throne with torn red velvet cushions, short wide-splayed
lion-legs, and cupids hovering over the chair-back,
bearing a crown. Then there was a wicked-looking, dusty,
cage-like, and horribly interesting thing, which intrigued
them much and long. If they were not quite mistaken, it
was a rat-trap, for they could see the iron spike to put the
bacon on, and it was dreadful to think how the trap-door
must fall down behind the great beast&hellip;. Yes, this took
time, and when they stood up after examining the rat-trap
their faces were hot, and their clothes stiff with rust and
dust. Klaus Heinrich brushed them both down, but that did
not do much good, for his hands were as filthy as his clothes.
And suddenly they saw that dusk had begun to fall. They
must return quickly, Ditlinde insisted anxiously on that; it
was too late to go any farther.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>&ldquo;That's an awful pity,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;Who knows
what else we mightn't have found, and when we shall get another
chance of rummaging, Ditlinde!&rdquo; But he followed his
sister and they hurried back down the turret-stairs, crossed
the hall of the pillars, and came out into the arcade, intending
to hurry home hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>Thus they wandered on for a time; but Klaus Heinrich
shook his head, for it seemed to him that this was not the
way he had come. They went still farther; but several signs
told them that they had mistaken their direction. This stone
seat with the griffin-heads was not standing here before.
That pointed window looked to the west over the low-lying
quarter of the town and not over the inner courtyard with
the rose-bush. They were going wrong, it was no use denying
it; perhaps they had left the hall of the pillars by a wrong
exit&mdash;anyhow they had absolutely lost their way.</p>

<p>They went back a little, but their disquietude would not
allow them to go very far back, so they turned right about
again, and decided to push on the way they had already come,
and to trust to luck. Their way lay through a damp, stuffy
atmosphere, and great undisturbed cobwebs stretched across
the corners; they went with heavy hearts, and Ditlinde especially
was full of repentance and on the brink of tears.
People would notice her absence, would &ldquo;look sadly&rdquo; at her,
perhaps even tell the Grand Duke; they would never find the
way, would be forgotten and die of hunger. And where there
was a rat-trap, Klaus Heinrich, there were also rats&hellip;. Klaus
Heinrich comforted her. They only had to find the
place where the armour and crossed standards hung; from
that point he was quite sure of the direction. And suddenly&mdash;they
had just passed a bend in the winding passage&mdash;suddenly
something happened. It startled them dreadfully.</p>

<p>What they had heard was more than the echo of their own
steps, they were other, strange steps, heavier than theirs; they
came towards them now quickly, now hesitatingly, and were
accompanied by a snorting and grumbling which made their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
blood run cold. Ditlinde made as if to run away from fright:
but Klaus Heinrich would not let go her hand, and they stood
with starting eyes waiting for what was coming.</p>

<p>It was a man who was just visible in the half-darkness,
and, calmly considered, his appearance was not horrifying.
He was squat in figure, and dressed like a veteran soldier.
He wore a frock-coat of old-fashioned cut, a woollen comforter
round his neck and a medal on his breast. He held in one
hand a curly top-hat and in the other the bone handle of his
clumsily rolled-up umbrella, which he tapped on the flags in
time with his steps. His thin grey hair was plastered up from
one ear in wisps over his skull. He had bow-shaped black
eyebrows, and a yellow-white beard, which grew like the
Grand Duke's, heavy upper-lids, and watery blue eyes with
pouches of withered skin under them; he had the usual high
cheek-bones, and the furrows of his sun-burnt face were like
crevasses. When he had come quite close he seemed to recognize
the children, for he placed himself against the outer wall
of the passage, at once fronted round and began to make a
number of bows, consisting of several short forward jerks of
his whole body from the feet upwards, while he imparted a
look of honesty to his mouth and held his top-hat crown-downwards
in front of him. Klaus Heinrich meant to pass
him by with a nod, but was surprised into halting, for the
veteran began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon!&rdquo; he suddenly grunted; then went on in a
more natural voice: &ldquo;I earnestly beg your young Highnesses'
pardon! But would your young Highnesses take it amiss if
I addressed to them the request that they would very kindly
acquaint me with the nearest way to the nearest exit? It
need not actually be the Albrechtstor&mdash;not in the least necessary
that it should be the Albrechtstor. But any exit from the
Schloss, if I dare be so free as to address this inquiry to
your young Highnesses&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich had laid his left hand on his hip, right behind,
so that it lay almost in his back, and looked at the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
ground. The man had simply spoken to him, had engaged
him directly and unavoidably in conversation; he thought of
his father and knitted his brows. He pondered feverishly over
the question how he ought to behave in this topsy-turvy and
incorrect situation. Albrecht would have pursed up his
mouth, sucked with his short, rounded under-lip lightly against
the upper, and passed on in silence&mdash;so much was certain.
But what was the use of rummaging if at the first serious
adventure one intended to pass on in dignity and dudgeon?
And the man was honest, and had nothing wicked about him:
that Klaus Heinrich could see when he forced himself to raise
his eyes. He simply said: &ldquo;You come with us, that's the
best way. I will willingly show you where you must turn off
to get to an exit.&rdquo; And they went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Ever so many thanks for your
kindness! Heaven knows I should never have thought that I
should live to walk about the Old Schloss one day with your
young Highnesses. But there it is, and after all my annoyance&mdash;for
I have been annoyed, terribly annoyed, that's true
and certain&mdash;after all my annoyance I have at any rate this
honour and this satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich longed to ask what might have been the
reason for so much annoyance; but the veteran went straight
on (and tapped his umbrella in regular time on the flags as
he went). &ldquo;&hellip;&nbsp;and I recognized your young Highnesses at
once, although it is a bit dark here in the passage, for I have
seen you many a time in the carriage, and was always delighted,
for I myself have just such a couple of brats at home&mdash;I
mean to say, mine are brats, mine are &hellip; and the boy
is called Klaus Heinrich too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like me?&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, overjoyed&hellip;.
&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no luck about it,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;considering he
was named expressly after you, for he is a couple of months
younger than you, and there are lots of children in the town
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>
and country who are called that, and all of them after you.
No, one can hardly call it luck&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich concealed his hand and remained silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, recognized you at once,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;And I
thought, thank Heaven, thought I, that's what I call fortune
in misfortune, and they'll help you out of the trap into which
you have stuck your nose, you old blockhead, and you've
good reason to laugh, thought I, for there's many a one has
trudged about here and been guyed by those popinjays, and
hasn't got out of it so well&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Popinjays? thought Klaus Heinrich &hellip; and guyed? He
looked straight in front of him, he did not dare to ask. A
fear, a hope struck him&hellip;. He said quite simply: &ldquo;They
&hellip; they guyed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I should think they did, the
ogres, and no mistake! But I don't mind telling your young
Highnesses, young though you are, but it'll do you good to
hear it, that these people here are a set of wasters. A man
comes and delivers his work as respectfully as possible&hellip;.
Yes, bless my soul!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, and tapped his forehead
with his hat. &ldquo;I haven't yet introduced myself to your
young Highnesses and told you who I am, have I?&mdash;Hinnerke!&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;Master-cobbler Hinnerke, Royal warrant-holder,
pensioner and medallist.&rdquo; And he pointed with the index-finger
of his great, rough, yellow-spotted hand to the medal
on his breast. &ldquo;The fact is, that his Royal Highness, your
father, has been graciously pleased to order a pair of boots
from me, top-boots, riding-boots, with spurs, and made of
the best quality patent-leather. They're my speciality, and
I made them myself and took a lot of trouble about them, and
they were ready to-day and ever so smart. &lsquo;You must go
yourself,&rsquo; says I to myself&hellip;. I have a boy who delivers,
but I says to myself: &lsquo;You must go yourself, they are for
the Grand Duke.&rsquo; So I rig myself out and take my boots and
go to the Schloss. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; say the lackeys down below,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
and want to take them from me, &lsquo;No!&rsquo; say I, for I don't
trust them. It's my reputation gets me my orders and my
warrant, let me tell your Highnesses, not because I tip the
lackeys. But the fellows are spoilt by tips from the warrant-holders,
and want to get something out of me for their trouble.
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; say I, for I'm not a one for bribing and underhand
dealings, &lsquo;I'll deliver them myself, and if I can't give them to
the Grand Duke himself, I'll give them to Valet Prahl.&rsquo; They
looked daggers, but they say: &lsquo;Then you must go up there!&rsquo;
And I go up there. There are some more of them up there,
and they say &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; and want to take charge of the boots,
but I ask for Prahl and stick to it. They say: &lsquo;He's having
his tea,&rsquo; but I'm determined and say, &lsquo;Then I'll wait till he's
finished.&rsquo; And just as I say it, who comes by in his buckled
shoes but Valet Prahl. And he sees me, and I give him the
boots with a few modest words, and he says &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; and
actually adds: &lsquo;They're fine!&rsquo; and nods and takes them off.
Now I'm satisfied, for Prahl, he's safe, so off I go. &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo;
cries somebody. &lsquo;Mr. Hinnerke! You're going wrong!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; says I, and right about, and go off in the other direction.
But that was the stupidest thing I could do, for they
had sent me to Jericho, and that's just where I don't want to
go. I walk on a bit and meet another one, and ask him the
way to the Albrechtstor. But he spots at once what's up,
and says: &lsquo;Go up the stairs, and then keep to the left and
then down again, and you'll cut off a large corner!&rsquo; And I
believe he means it kindly and do what he says, and get more
and more muddled and altogether lose my bearings. Then
I see that it's not my fault, but the rogues', and it strikes me
that I have heard that they often play that trick on Court
tradesmen who don't tip them, and let them wander about
till they sweat. And my fury makes me blind and stupid,
and I get to places where there's not a living soul, and don't
know where I am and get properly put about. And at last
I meet your young Highnesses. Yes, that's how it is with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>
me and my boots!&rdquo; ended Shoemaker Hinnerke, and wiped
his forehead with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich squeezed Ditlinde's hand. His heart beat
so loud that he absolutely forgot to hide his left hand. That
was it. That was a touch of it, an outline! No doubt about
it, that was the sort of thing his &ldquo;exalted calling&rdquo; shielded
him from, the sort of thing people did when they were in
the ordinary, work-a-day frame of mind. The lackeys&hellip;.
He said nothing, words failed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that your young Highnesses don't answer,&rdquo; said the
shoemaker. And his honest voice was filled with emotion.
&ldquo;I oughtn't to have told you, because it isn't your business
to get to know all the wickedness that goes on. But yet I
don't know,&rdquo; he said, laid his head on one side and snapped
his fingers, &ldquo;that it can do any harm, that it can do you any
harm for the future and later on&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lackeys&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, and took a plunge
&hellip; &ldquo;are they wicked? I can quite well fancy&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wicked?&rdquo; said the cobbler. &ldquo;Good-for-nothings they are.
That's the name for them. Do you know what they're good
for? They keep the goods back when no tip's forthcoming,
keep them back when the tradesman delivers them punctually
at the time ordered, and only hand them over days late, so
that the tradesman gets blamed, and is considered by the
Grand Duke to have failed in his duty and he loses his orders.
That's what they do without scruple, and the whole town
knows it&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's most annoying!&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. He listened,
listened. He hardly realized how much shocked he was.
&ldquo;Do they do anything else?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm quite sure they
must do other things of the same kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said the man, and laughed. &ldquo;No, they don't
miss a chance, let me tell your Highnesses, they have all sorts
of dodges. There's the door-opening joke, for instance&hellip;.
That's like this. Your father, our gracious Grand Duke,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
grants an audience to somebody, let's suppose he's a new hand
and it's his first time at Court. And he comes in a frock
coat all sweat and shivers, for it is of course no trifle to stand
before his Royal Highness for the first time. And the lackeys
laugh at him, because they're quite at home here, and tow
him into the ante-room, and he doesn't know where he is,
and absolutely forgets to tip the lackeys. But then comes
his moment, and the adjutant says his name, and the lackeys
throw open the double-doors and let him into the room in
which the Grand Duke is waiting. Then the new hand stands
there and bows and says what he has to say, and the Grand
Duke graciously gives him his hand, and so he is dismissed
and walks backwards, and thinks the folding-doors are going
to open behind him, as he has been definitely promised. But
they don't open, I tell your Highnesses, for the lackeys have
got their knife into him, because they haven't been tipped,
and don't stir a finger for him outside there. But he daren't
turn round, absolutely daren't, because he daren't show the
Grand Duke his back, that would be grossly bad manners and
an insult to his Highness. And then he feels behind him for
the door-handle and can't find it, and gets the jumps and
scrabbles around on the door, and when at last by the mercy
of Providence he finds the knob it's an old-fashioned lock,
and he doesn't understand it and fiddles and dislocates his
arm and tires himself out and keeps bowing all the time in
his agitation, until at last his Highness graciously lets him
out with his own hand. Yes, that's the door-opening joke!
But that's nothing to what I'm going to tell your Highness&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been so deep in conversation that they had
scarcely noticed where they were going, had gone down the
stairs and reached the ground-floor, close to the Albrechtstor.
Eiermann, one of the Grand Duchess's grooms-of-the-chamber,
came towards them. He wore a violet coat and side-whiskers.
He had been sent out to look for their Grand Ducal Highnesses.
He shook his head while still at a distance, in lively
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
concern, and pursed his mouth up like a funnel. But when
he noticed Shoemaker Hinnerke walking with the children and
tapping with his umbrella, all the muscles of his face relaxed
and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>There was scarcely time for thanks and farewells, Eiermann
was in such a hurry to part the children from the shoemaker.
And with many a gloomy prophecy he led their
Grand Ducal Highnesses up to their room to the Swiss
governess.</p>

<p>Eyes were turned to heaven, hands were wrung about their
absence and the state of their clothes. The worst of all happened,
they were &ldquo;looked at sadly.&rdquo; But Klaus Heinrich
confined his contrition to the bare minimum. He thought:
&ldquo;So the lackeys took money and let the tradesmen wander
about the corridors if they did not get any, kept the goods
back, that the tradesmen might get blamed, and did not open
the folding-doors, so that the suitor had to scrabble. That's
what happened in the Schloss, and what must it be outside?
Outside among the people who stared at him so respectfully
and so strangely, when he drove by with his hand to his
hat&nbsp;&hellip;? But how had the man dared to tell it him? Not
one single time had he called him Grand Ducal Highness;
he had forced himself on him and offended his birth and upbringing.
And yet, why was it so extraordinarily pleasant
to hear all that about the lackeys? Why did his heart beat
with such rapt pleasure, when moved by some of the wild
and bold things in which his Highness bore no part?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>IV<br/>
<small>DOCTOR UEBERBEIN</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Klaus Heinrich</span> spent three of his boyhood's years in the
company of boys of his own age of the Court and country
nobility of the monarchy in an institution, a kind of aristocratic
seminary, which von Knobelsdorff, the House Minister,
had founded and set in order on his behalf in the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo;
hunting-schloss.</p>

<p>A Crown property for centuries past, Schloss &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo;
gave its name to the first stopping-place of a State railway
running north-west from the capital, and itself took it from
a &ldquo;tame&rdquo; pheasant preserve, situated not far off among the
meadows and woods, which had been the hobby of a former
ruler. The Schloss, a one-storied box-like country house
with a shingle roof topped by lightning conductors, stood
with stables and coach-house on the skirts of extensive fir
plantations. With a row of aged lime trees in front, it looked
out over a broad expanse of meadowland fringed by a distant
bluish circle of woods and intersected by paths, with many
a bare patch of play-ground and hurdles for obstacle riding.
Opposite the corner of the Schloss was a refreshment pavilion,
a beer and coffee garden planted with high trees, which a
prudent man called Stavenüter had rented and which was
thronged on Sundays in summer by excursionists, especially
bicyclists, from the capital. The pupils of the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo;
were only allowed to visit the pavilion in charge of a tutor.</p>

<p>There were five of them, not counting Klaus Heinrich:
Trümmerhauff, Gumplach, Platow, Prenzlau, and Wehrzahn.
They were called &ldquo;the Pheasants&rdquo; in the country round. They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
had a landau from the Court stables which had seen its best
days, a dog-cart, a sledge, and a few hacks, and when in
winter some of the meadows were flooded and frozen over,
they had an opportunity of skating. There was one cook,
two chamber-maids, one coachman, and two lackeys at the
&ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo; one of whom could drive at a pinch.</p>

<p>Professor Kürtchen, a little suspicious and irritable bachelor
with the airs of a comic actor and the manners of an old
French chevalier, was head of the seminary. He wore a
stubby grey moustache, a pair of gold spectacles in front of
his restless brown eyes, and always out-of-doors a top hat on
the back of his head. He stuck his belly out as he walked
and held his little fists on each side of his stomach like a
long-distance runner. He treated Klaus Heinrich with self-satisfied
tact, but was full of suspicion of the noble arrogance
of his other pupils and fired up like a tom-cat when he
scented any signs of contempt for him as a commoner. He
loved when out for a walk, if there were people close by,
to stop and gather his pupils in a knot around him and explain
something to them, drawing diagrams in the sand with
his stick. He addressed Frau Amelung, the housekeeper, a
captain's widow who smelt strongly of drugs, as &ldquo;my lady&rdquo;
and showed thus that he knew what was what in the best
circles.</p>

<p>Professor Kürtchen was helped by a yet younger assistant
teacher with a doctor's degree&mdash;a good-humoured, energetic
man, bumptious but enthusiastic, who influenced Klaus Heinrich's
views and conscience perhaps more than was good
for him. A gymnastic instructor called Zotte had also been
appointed. The assistant teacher, it may be remarked in
passing, was called Ueberbein, Raoul Ueberbein. The rest
of the staff came every day by railway from the capital.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich remarked with appreciation that the demands
made on him from the point of view of learning
quickly abated. Schulrat Dröge's wrinkled fore-finger no
longer paused on the lines, he had done his work; and during
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
the lessons as well as while correcting his written work Professor
Kürtchen seized every opportunity of showing his tact.</p>

<p>One day, quite soon after the institution had started&mdash;it was
after luncheon in the high-windowed dining-room&mdash;he summoned
Klaus Heinrich into his study, and said in so many
words: &ldquo;It is contrary to the public interest that your Grand
Ducal Highness, during our scientific studies together, should
be compelled to answer questions which are at the moment
unwelcome to you. On the other hand, it is desirable that
your Grand Ducal Highness should continually announce your
readiness to answer by holding up your hand. I beg your
Grand Ducal Highness accordingly, for my own information,
in the case of unwelcome questions, to stretch out your arm to
its full length, but in the case of those an invitation to answer
which would be agreeable to you, to raise it only half way
and in a right angle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Doctor Ueberbein, he filled the schoolroom with a
noisy flow of words, whose cheerfulness disguised the teacher's
object without losing sight of it altogether. He had come to
no sort of understanding with Klaus Heinrich, but questioned
him when it occurred to him to do so, in a free and friendly
way without causing him any embarrassment. And Klaus
Heinrich's by no means apropos answers seemed to enchant
Doctor Ueberbein, to inspire him with warm enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; he would cry and throw his head back laughing.
&ldquo;Oh, Klaus Heinrich! Oh, scion of princes! Oh, your innocency!
The crude problems of life have caught you unprepared!
Now then, it is for me with my experience to put
you straight.&rdquo; And he gave the answer himself, asked nobody
else, when Klaus Heinrich had answered wrong. The
mode of instruction of the other teachers bore the character
of an unassuming lecture. And gymnastic-instructor Zotte
had received orders from high quarters to conduct the physical
exercises with every regard to Klaus Heinrich's left hand&mdash;so
strictly that the attention of the Prince himself or of
his companions should never be drawn unnecessarily to his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
little failing. So the exercises were limited to running games,
and during the riding lessons, which Herr Zotte also gave,
all feats of daring were rigorously excluded.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich's relations with his comrades were not what
one might call intimate, they did not extend to actual familiarity.
He stood for himself, was never one of them, by no
means counted amongst their number. They were five and
he was one; the Prince, the five, and the teachers, that was
the establishment. Several things stood in the way of a free
friendship. The five were there on Klaus Heinrich's account,
they were ordered to associate with him; when during the
lessons he answered wrong they were not asked to correct him,
they had to adjust themselves to his capacity when riding or
playing. They were too often reminded of the advantages
they gained by being allowed to share his life. Some of
them, the young von Gumplach, von Platow, and von Wehrzahn,
sons of country squires of moderate means, were oppressed
the whole time by the gratified pride their parents had shown
when the invitation from the House Minister reached them,
by the congratulations which had poured in from every side.</p>

<p>Count Prenzlau on the other hand, that thick-set, red-haired,
freckled youth with the breathless way of speaking and the
Christian name Bogumil, was a sprig of the richest and
noblest family of landowners in the land, spoilt and self-conscious.
He was well aware that his parents had not been
able to refuse Baron von Knobelsdorff's invitation, but that
it had not seemed to them by any means a blessing from the
clouds, and that he, Count Bogumil, could have lived much
better and more in accordance with his position on his father's
property than at the &ldquo;Pheasantry.&rdquo; He found the hacks bad,
the landau shabby, and the dog-cart old-fashioned; he grumbled
privately over the food.</p>

<p>Dagobert Count Trümmerhauff, a spare, greyhound-looking
youth, who spoke in a whisper, was inseparable from him.
They had a word among themselves which fully expressed
their critical and aristocratic bent, and which they constantly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
uttered in a biting tone of voice: &ldquo;hog-wash.&rdquo; It was hog-wash
to have loose collars buttoning on to one's shirt. It
was hog-wash to play lawn-tennis in one's ordinary clothes.</p>

<p>But Klaus Heinrich felt himself unequal to using the word.
He had not hitherto been aware that there were such things
as shirts with collars sewed on to them and that people could
possess so many changes of clothes at one time as Bogumil
Prenzlau. He would have liked to say &ldquo;hog-wash,&rdquo; but it
occurred to him that he was wearing at that very time darned
socks. He felt inelegant by the side of Prenzlau and coarse
compared with Trümmerhauff. <ins title="Trümmerhauf">Trümmerhauff</ins> had the nobility
of a wild beast. He had a long pointed nose with a sharp
bridge and broad, quivering, thin-walled nostrils, blue veins
on his delicate temples and small ears without lobes. He
wore broad coloured cuffs fastened with gold links, and his
hands were like those of a dainty woman, with filbert nails;
a gold bracelet adorned one of his wrists. He half closed
his eyes as he whispered&hellip;. No, it was obvious that Klaus
Heinrich could not compete with Trümmerhauff in elegance.
His right hand was rather broad, he had <ins title="cheek bones">cheek-bones</ins> like the
men in the street, and he looked quite stumpy by Dagobert's
side. It was quite possible that Albrecht might have been
better qualified to join the &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; in their use of &ldquo;hog-wash.&rdquo;
Klaus Heinrich for his part was no aristocrat, absolutely
none, unmistakable facts showed that. For consider
his name, Klaus Heinrich, that's what the shoemaker's sons
were called all over the place. Herr Stavenüter's children
over the road too, who blew their noses with their fingers,
bore the same names as himself, his parents, and his brother.
But the lordlings were called Bogumil and Dagobert&mdash;Klaus
Heinrich stood solitary and alone among the five.</p>

<p>However, he formed one friendship at the &ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo;
and it was with Doctor Ueberbein. The Usher Raoul Ueberbein
was not a handsome man. He had a red beard and a
greenish-white complexion with watery blue eyes, thin red
hair, and unusually ugly, protruding, sharp-pointed ears.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
But his hands were small and delicate. He wore white ties
exclusively, which gave him rather a distinguished appearance,
although his wardrobe was scanty. He wore a long
great-coat out-of-doors, and when riding&mdash;for Dr. Ueberbein
rode, and excellently well too&mdash;a worn-out frock-coat whose
skirts he fastened up with safety-pins, tight buttoned breeches,
and a high hat.</p>

<p>Where lay the attraction he exercised on Klaus Heinrich?
That attraction was very composite. The &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; had
not been long together before a report went about that the
usher had dragged a child a long time ago, in circumstances
of extreme peril, out of a swamp or bog, and was the possessor
of a medal for saving life. That was one impression.
Later other details of Doctor Ueberbein's life came to be
known, and Klaus Heinrich too heard of them. It was said
that his origin was obscure, that he had no father, his mother
had been an actress who had paid some poor people to adopt
him, and that he had once been starved, which accounted for
the greenish tint of his complexion. These were things which
did not bear being brought into the light or even being thought
of, wild, remote things, to which, however, Doctor Ueberbein
himself sometimes alluded&mdash;when, for instance, the lordlings,
who could not forget his obscure origin, behaved impudently
or unbecomingly towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suck-a-thumbs and mammy's darlings!&rdquo; he would say
then in loud dudgeon. &ldquo;I've knocked about long enough to
deserve some respect from you young gentlemen!&rdquo; This fact
too, that Doctor Ueberbein had &ldquo;knocked about,&rdquo; did not fail
of effect on Klaus Heinrich. But the especial charm of the
doctor's person lay in the directness of his attitude towards
Klaus Heinrich, the tone in which he addressed him from the
very beginning, and which distinguished him clearly from
everybody else. There was nothing about him which reminded
one of the stiff reticence of the lackeys, of the governess's
pale horror, of Schulrat Dröge's professional bows,
or of Professor Kürtchen's self-satisfied deference. There
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
was nothing about him to recall the strange, loyal, and yet
impertinent way in which people outside stared at Klaus
Heinrich.</p>

<p>During the first few days after the seminary assembled, he
kept silence and confined himself to observation, but then he
approached the Prince with a jovial and cheery frankness,
a fresh fatherly camaraderie such as Klaus Heinrich had
never before experienced. It disturbed him at first, he looked
in terror at the doctor's green face; but his confusion found
no echo in the doctor, and in no way discouraged him, it
confirmed him in his hearty bumptious ingenuousness, and it
was not long before Klaus Heinrich was warmed and won,
for there was nothing vulgar, nothing degrading, not even
anything designed and school-masterish in Doctor Ueberbein's
methods&mdash;all they showed was the superiority of a man who
had knocked about the world, and, at the same time, his
tender and open respect for Klaus Heinrich's different birth
and position; they showed affection and recognition, at the
same time as the cheerful offer of a league between their two
different kinds of existence. He called him &ldquo;Highness&rdquo; once
or twice, then simply &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; then quite simply &ldquo;Klaus
Heinrich.&rdquo; And he stuck to the last.</p>

<p>When the &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; went out for a ride, these two rode
at the head, the doctor on his stout piebald to the left of
Klaus Heinrich on his docile chestnut&mdash;trotted when snow or
leaves were falling, through springtime thaws or summer heat,
along the edge of the woodlands across country, or through
the villages, while Doctor Ueberbein related anecdotes of his
life. Raoul Ueberbein sounds funny, doesn't it? The very
reverse of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>. Yes, Ueberbein had been the name of his
adoptive parents, a poor, oldish couple of the inferior bank-clerk
class, and he had a quite legal right to it. But that
he should be called Raoul had been the decision and mandate
of his mother, when she handed over the sum agreed on,
together with his fateful little person, to the others&mdash;a sentimental
decision obviously, a decision prompted by piety.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
At least it was quite possible that his legal and real father
had been called Raoul, and it was to be hoped that his surname
had been something which harmonized with it.</p>

<p>For the rest, it had been rather a wild undertaking on the
part of his adoptive parents to adopt a child, for &ldquo;Barmecide
had been cook&rdquo; in the Ueberbein establishment, and it was
obvious that it had been only the most urgent necessity which
had made them jump at the money. The boy had been given
only the scantiest of school educations, but he had taken the
liberty of showing what he was made of, had distinguished
himself to some extent, and as he was keen to become a
teacher, he had been granted out of a public fund the means
of obtaining a college education. Well, he had finished his
college course not without distinction, as indeed it was expected
of him that he should, and he had then been appointed
a teacher in a public elementary school, with a good salary,
out of which he had managed to give occasional doles by
way of gratitude to his honest adoptive parents, until they
died almost simultaneously. And a happy release it was for
them!</p>

<p>And so he had been left alone in the world, his very birth
a misfortune, as poor as a sparrow and endowed by Providence
with a green face and dog's ears by way of personal
recommendations. Attractive qualifications, were they not?
But such qualifications were really favourable ones&mdash;once for
all, so they proved. A miserable boyhood, loneliness and
exclusion from good fortune and all that good fortune brings,
a never-ceasing, imperious call to be up and doing, no fear
of getting fat and lazy, one's moral fibre was braced, one
could never rest on one's oars, but must be always overhauling
and passing others. Could anything be more stimulating,
when the hard facts were brought home to one? What a
handicap over others who &ldquo;were not obliged to&rdquo; to the same
extent! People who could smoke cigars in the morning&hellip;.</p>

<p>At that time, by the bedside of one of his unwashed little
pupils, in a room which did not smell exactly of spring blossoms,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
Raoul Ueberbein had made friends with a young man&mdash;some
years older than he, but in a similar position and
like him ill-fated by birth in so far as he was a Jew. Klaus
Heinrich knew him&mdash;indeed, he might be said to have got to
know him on a very intimate occasion. Sammet was his
name, a doctor of medicine; he happened by chance to have
been in the Grimmburg when Klaus Heinrich was born, and
had set up a couple of years later in the capital as a children's
doctor. Well, he had been a friend of Ueberbein's, still was
one, and they had had many a good talk about fate and duty.
What is more, they had both knocked about the world.</p>

<p>Ueberbein, for his part, looked back with sincere pleasure
to the time when he had been an elementary teacher. His
activities had not been entirely confined to the class-room, he
had amused himself by showing also some personal and human
concern for his charges' welfare, by visiting them at home,
by sharing at times their not too idyllic family life, and in
doing so he did not fail to bring away impressions of a most
varied kind. In truth, if he had not already tasted the bitterness
of the cup of life, he would have had plenty of opportunity
then to do so. For the rest, he had not ceased to
work by himself, had given private lessons to plump tradesmen's
sons, and tightened his waist belt so as to save enough
to buy books with&mdash;had spent the long, still, and free nights
in study. And one day he had passed the State examination
with exceptional distinction, had soon received his promotion,
had been transferred to a grammar school. As a matter of
fact, it had been a sore grief to him to leave his little charges,
but so the fates willed. And then it had so happened that he
had been chosen to be usher at the &ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo; for all that
his very birth had been a misfortune.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>That was Doctor Ueberbein's story, and Klaus Heinrich, as
he listened to it, was filled with friendly feelings. He shared
his contempt for those who &ldquo;weren't obliged to&rdquo; and smoked
cigars in the morning, he felt a fearful joy when Ueberbein
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
talked in his jolly blustering way about &ldquo;knocking about,&rdquo;
&ldquo;impressions,&rdquo; and the bitterness of the cup of life, and he
felt as if he had been personally an actor in the scenes as he
followed his luckless and gallant career from his adoption
up to his appointment as grammar-schoolmaster. He felt as
if he were in some general sort of way qualified to take part
in a conversation about fate and duty. His attitude of reserve
relaxed, the experiences of his own fifteen years of life came
crowding in upon him, he felt a longing himself to retail
confidences, and he tried to tell Doctor Ueberbein all about
himself.</p>

<p>But the funny thing was that Doctor Ueberbein himself
checked him, opposed any such intention most decidedly.
&ldquo;No, no, Klaus Heinrich,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;full stop there! No
confidences, if you please! Not but that I know that you
have all sorts of things to tell me&hellip;. I need only watch
you for half a day to see that, but you quite misunderstand
me if you think I'm likely to encourage you to weep round
my neck. In the first place, sooner or later you'd repent it.
But in the second, the pleasures of a confidential intimacy are
not for the likes of you. You see, there's no harm in my
chattering. What am I? An usher. Not a common or
garden one, in my own opinion, but still no better than such.
Just a categorical unit. But you? What are you? That's
harder to say&hellip;. Let's say a conception, a kind of ideal.
A frame. An emblematical existence, Klaus Heinrich, and at
the same time a formal existence. But formality and intimacy&mdash;haven't
you yet learnt that the two are mutually exclusive?
Absolutely exclusive. You have no right to intimate
confidences, and if you attempted them you yourself would
discover that they did not suit you, would find them inadequate
and insipid. I must remind you of your duty, Klaus
Heinrich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich laughed and saluted with his crop, and on
they rode.</p>

<p>On another occasion Doctor Ueberbein said casually:
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
&ldquo;Popularity is a not very profound, but a grand and comprehensive
kind of familiarity.&rdquo; And that was all he said on
the subject.</p>

<p>Sometimes in summer, during the long intervals between
the morning lessons, they would sit together in the empty
pavilion, or stroll about the &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; playground, discussing
various topics, and breaking off to drink lemonade provided
by Herr Stavenüter. Herr Stavenüter beamed as he
wiped the rough table and brought the lemonade with his own
hands. The glass ball in the bottle-neck had to be pushed in.
&ldquo;Sound stuff!&rdquo; said Herr Stavenüter. &ldquo;The best that can be
got. No muck, Grand Ducal Highness, and you, doctor, but
just sweetened fruit-juice. I can honestly recommend it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he made his children sing in honour of the visit.
There were three of them, two girls and a boy, and they
could sing trios. They stood some way off with the green
leaves of the chestnut trees for roof, and sang folk-songs
while they blew their noses with their fingers. Once they sang
a song beginning: &ldquo;We are all but mortal men,&rdquo; and Doctor
Ueberbein took advantage of the pauses to express his disapproval
of this number on the programme. &ldquo;A paltry song,&rdquo;
he said, and leaned over towards Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;A really
commonplace song, a lazy song, Klaus Heinrich; you must
not let it appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, when the children had stopped singing, he returned
to the song and described it as &ldquo;sloppy.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are all but
mortal men,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;God bless us, yes, no doubt we
are. But on the other hand we ought perhaps to remember
that it is those of us who count for most who may be the
occasion for especially emphasizing this truth&hellip;. Look
you,&rdquo; he said, leaning back and crossing one leg over the
other, while he stroked his beard up from underneath his
chin, &ldquo;look you, Klaus Heinrich, a man who has my intellectual
aspirations will not be able to help searching for and
clinging to whatever is out of the ordinary in this drab world
of ours, wherever and however it appears&mdash;he cannot help
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
being put out by such a slovenly song, by such a sheepish
abjuration of the exceptional, of the lofty and of the miserable,
and of that which is both at once. You may well say:
&lsquo;That's talking for effect.&rsquo; I'm only an usher, but there's
something in my blood, Heaven knows what&mdash;I can't find
any pleasure in emphasizing the fact that we are all ushers
at bottom. I love the extraordinary in every form and in
every sense. I love those who are conscious of the dignity
of their exceptional station, the marked men, those one can
see are not as other men, all those whom the people stare
at open-mouthed&mdash;I hope they'll appreciate their destiny,
and I do not wish them to make themselves comfortable with
the slip-shod and luke-warm truth which we have just heard
set to music for three voices. Why have I become your tutor,
Klaus Heinrich? I am a gipsy, a hard-working one, maybe,
but still a born gipsy. My predestination to the rôle of
squire of princes is not particularly obvious. Why did I
gladly obey the call when it came to me, in view of my
energy, and although my very birth was a misfortune? Because,
Klaus Heinrich, I see in your existence the clearest,
most express, and best-preserved form of the extraordinary
in the world. I have become your tutor that I might keep
your destiny alive in you. Reserve, etiquette, obligation,
duty, demeanour, formality&mdash;has the man whose life is surrounded
by these no right to despise others? Ought he to
allow himself to be reminded of humanity and good nature?
No, come along, let's go, Klaus Heinrich, if you don't mind.
They're tactless brats, these little Stavenüters.&rdquo; Klaus Heinrich
laughed, he gave the children some of his pocket-money,
and they went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein in the course of an
ordinary walk in the woods to Klaus Heinrich&mdash;they had
drifted a little distance away from the five &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;nowadays
the soul's thirst for veneration has to be satisfied
with what it can get. Where will you find greatness? I
only hope you may! But quite apart from all actual greatness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
and high-calling, there is always what I call Highness,
select and sadly isolated forms of life, towards which an attitude
of the tenderest sympathy should be adopted. For the
rest, greatness is strong, it wears jack-boots, it has no need
of the knight-services of the mind. But Highness is affecting&mdash;damme
if it isn't the most affecting thing on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once or twice a year the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo; journeyed to the
capital to attend performances of classical operas and dramas
in the Grand Ducal Court Theatre; Klaus Heinrich's birthday
in particular was the signal for a visit to the theatre. He
would then sit quietly in his carved arm-chair, leaning against
the red plush ledge of the Court box, whose roof rested on
the heads of two female figures with crossed hands and empty
stern faces, and watched his colleagues, the princes, whose
destinies were played out on the stage, while he stood the fire
of the opera-glasses which from time to time, even during
the play, were directed at him from the audience. Professor
Kürtchen sat on his left hand and Doctor Ueberbein with
the &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; in an adjoining box.</p>

<p>Once they heard the &ldquo;Magic Flute,&rdquo; and on the way home
to &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo; station, in the first-class carriage, Doctor
Ueberbein made the whole collection of them laugh by imitating
the way in which singers talk when their rôles oblige
them to talk in prose. &ldquo;He is a prince!&rdquo; he said with pathos,
and answered himself in a drawly, sing-song parsonical
voice. &ldquo;He is more than that, he is a man!&rdquo; Even Professor
Kürtchen was so much amused that he bleated.</p>

<p>But next day, in the course of a private lesson in Klaus
Heinrich's study, with the round mahogany table, whitened
ceiling, and Greek bust on the stove, Doctor Ueberbein repeated
his parody, and said then: &ldquo;Great heavens, that was
something new in its time, it was a piece of news, a startling
truth! There are paradoxes which have stood so long on
their heads that one has to put them on their feet to make
anything even moderately daring out of them, &lsquo;He is a man.
He is more than that&rsquo;&mdash;that is getting gradually bolder, prettier,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
even truer. The converse is mere humanity, but I have
no hearty love for humanity, I'm quite content to leave it
out of account. One must, in a certain sense, be one of
those of whom the people say: &lsquo;They are, after all, mortal
men too&rsquo;&mdash;or one is as deadly dull as an usher. I cannot
honestly wish for the general comfortable obliteration of conflicts
and gulfs, that's the way I am made, for better or worse,
and the idea of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">principe uomo</i> is to me, to speak plainly,
an abomination. I am not anxious that it should particularly
appeal to you&hellip;. Look you, there have always been princes
and exceptional persons who live their life of exception
with a light heart, simply unconscious of their dignity or
denying it outright, and capable of playing skittles with the
townsfolk in their shirt-sleeves, without the slightest attempt
at an inward qualm. But they are not very important, just
as nothing is important which lacks mind. For mind, Klaus
Heinrich, mind is the tutor which insists inexorably on dignity,
indeed actually creates dignity, it is the arch-enemy and chief
antagonist of all human good nature. &lsquo;More than that?&rsquo;
No! to be a representative, to stand for a number when one
appears to be the exalted and refined expression of a multitude.
Representing is naturally something more and higher
than simply Being, Klaus Heinrich&mdash;and that's why people
call you Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So argued Doctor Ueberbein, in loud, hearty, and fluent
terms, and what he said influenced Klaus Heinrich's mind and
susceptibilities more, perhaps, than was desirable. The prince
was then about fifteen years old, and therefore quite competent,
if not properly to understand, yet to imbibe the essence
of ideas of that sort. The main point was that Doctor
Ueberbein's doctrines and apophthegms were so exceptionally
supported by his personality.</p>

<p>When Schulrat Dröge, the man who used to bow to the
lackeys, reminded Klaus Heinrich of his &ldquo;exalted calling,&rdquo;
that was nothing more than an exaggerated form of speech,
devoid of inner meaning and calculated mainly to add emphasis
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
to his professional claims. But when Doctor Ueberbein,
whose very birth had been a misfortune, as he said,
and who had a green complexion because he had been half
starved; when this man who had dragged a child out of a
bog, who had received &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; and &ldquo;knocked about&rdquo;
in all sorts of ways; when he who not only did not bow to
the lackeys, but who bawled at them in strident tones when
the fancy took him, and who had called Klaus Heinrich himself
straight out by his Christian names when he had known
him only three days, without asking leave to do so,&mdash;when he
with a paternal laugh declared that Klaus Heinrich's &ldquo;path
lay among the heights of mankind&rdquo; (a favourite expression
of his), the effect was a feeling of freedom and originality
which awoke an echo deep down in the prince's soul.</p>

<p>When Klaus Heinrich listened to the doctor's loud and jolly
anecdotes of his life, of the &ldquo;bitterness of the cup of life,&rdquo;
he felt as he used to when he went rummaging with Ditlinde
his sister, and that the man who could tell such anecdotes,
that this &ldquo;rolling stone,&rdquo; as he called himself, did not, like
the others, adopt a reserved and deferential attitude towards
him, but, without prejudice to a free and cheerful homage,
treated him as a comrade in fate and destiny, warmed Klaus
Heinrich's heart to inexpressible gratitude and completed the
charm which bound him to the usher for ever&hellip;.</p>

<p>Shortly after his sixteenth birthday (Albrecht, the Heir
Apparent, was at the time in the South for his health) the
Prince was confirmed, together with the five &ldquo;Pheasants,&rdquo; in
the Court Church. The <i>Courier</i> reported the fact without
making any sensation of it. Dom Wislezenus, the President
of the High Consistory, treated a Bible text in counterpoint,
this time to the choice of the Grand Duke, and Klaus Heinrich
was on this occasion gazetted a Lieutenant, although he
had not the foggiest notion of things military&hellip;. His existence
was becoming more and more barren of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">expertise</i>.
The ceremonial of the confirmation also lacked incisive significance,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
and the Prince returned immediately afterwards
quietly back to the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo; to continue his life amongst
his tutors and schoolfellows without any alteration.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It was not till one year later that he left his old-fashioned
homely schoolroom with the torso on the stove; the seminary
was broken up, and while his five noble comrades were transferred
to the Corps of Cadets, Klaus Heinrich again took up
his abode in the Old Schloss, intending, in accordance with
an agreement which Herr von Knobelsdorff had come to with
the Grand Duke, to spend a year at the upper gymnasium
classes in the capital. This was a well-calculated and popular
step, which however did not make much difference from the
point of view of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">expertise</i>. Professor Kürtchen had gone
back to his post at the public academy, he instructed Klaus
Heinrich as before in several branches of knowledge, and
showed even greater zeal than he had at the seminary, being
determined to let everybody see how tactful he was. It also
appeared that he had told the rest of the staff of the agreement
reached with regard to the two ways in which the Prince
should announce his feelings with regard to answering a
question.</p>

<p>As to Doctor Ueberbein, who had also returned to the
academy, he had not yet advanced so far in his unusual career
as to teach the highest class. But at Klaus Heinrich's lively,
even insistent request, preferred by him to the Grand Duke,
not by word of mouth but by official channels, so to speak,
through the benevolent Herr von Knobelsdorff, the usher
was appointed tutor and superintendent of home studies,
came daily to the Schloss, bawled at the lackeys, and had every
opportunity of working on the Prince with his intellectual and
enthusiastic talk. Perhaps it was partly the fault of this
influence that Klaus Heinrich's relations with the young
people with whom he shared the much-hacked school-benches
continued even looser and more distant than his connexion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>
with the five at the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo;; and if thus the popularity
which this year was intended to secure was not attained, the
intervals, which both in summer and in winter were spent by
all the scholars in the roomy paved courtyard, offered opportunities
for camaraderie.</p>

<p>But these intervals, intended to refresh the ordinary scholars,
brought with them for Klaus Heinrich the first actual effort
of the kind of which his life was to be full. He was naturally,
at least during the first term, the cynosure of every eye in
the play-ground&mdash;no easy matter for him, in view of the fact
that here the surroundings deprived him of every external
support and attribute of dignity, and he was obliged to play
on the same pavement as those whose common idea was to
stare at him. The little boys, full of childlike irresponsibility,
hung about close to him and gaped, while the bigger
ones hovered around with wide-open eyes and looked at him
out of the corners of them or from under their eyelids&hellip;.
The excitement dwindled in course of time, but even then&mdash;whether
the fault was Klaus Heinrich's or the others'&mdash;even
later the camaraderie somehow did not make much progress.
One might see the prince, on the right of the head master or
the usher-in-charge, followed and surrounded by the curious,
strolling up and down the courtyard. One could see him,
too, chatting with his schoolfellows.</p>

<p>What a charming sight it was! There he leaned, half-sitting
on the slope of the glazed-brick wall, with his feet
crossed, and his left hand thrust far behind on his hips, with
the fifteen members of the first class in a half-circle round
him. There were only fifteen this year, for the last promotions
had been made with the object in view that the select
should contain no elements which were unfitted by origin or
personality to be for a year on Christian-name terms with
Klaus Heinrich. For the use of Christian names was ordered.
Klaus Heinrich conversed with one of them, who had advanced
a little towards him out of the semicircle, and answered him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
with little short bows. Both laughed, everybody laughed
directly they began to talk to Klaus Heinrich. He asked
him for instance: &ldquo;Have you yet done your German essay for
next Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Prince Klaus Heinrich, not quite yet; I haven't yet
done the last part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a difficult subject. I haven't any idea yet what to
write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Highness will&hellip;. You'll soon think of something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it's difficult&hellip;. You got an alpha in arithmetic,
didn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Prince Klaus Heinrich, I was lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you deserved it. I shall never be able to make anything
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Murmurs of amusement and gratification in the semicircle.
Klaus Heinrich turned to another schoolfellow, and the first
stepped quickly back. Everybody felt that the really important
point was not the essay nor the arithmetic, but the
conversation as an event and an undertaking, one's attitude
and tone, the way one advanced or retired, the success with
which one assumed a sympathetic, self-collected, and refined
demeanour. Perhaps it was the consciousness of this which
brought the smile to everybody's lips.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he had the semicircle in front of him,
Klaus Heinrich would say some such words as &ldquo;Professor
Nicolovius looks an owl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great then was the merriment among the others. Such a
remark was the signal for general unbending, they kicked
over the traces, &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;&nbsp;'d in chorus in their newly
cracked voices, and one would declare Klaus Heinrich to be
a &ldquo;ripping chap.&rdquo; But Klaus Heinrich did not often say
such things, he only said them when he saw the smile on the
others' faces grow faint and wan, and signs of boredom or
even of impatience showing themselves; he said them by way
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
of cheering them up, and at the extravagant laughter by which
they were followed he wore a look half of curiosity, half of
dismay.</p>

<p>It was not Anselm Schickedanz who called him a &ldquo;ripping
chap,&rdquo; and yet it was directly on his account that Klaus Heinrich
had compared Professor Nicolovius to an owl. Anselm
Schickedanz had laughed like the others at the joke, but
not in quite the same approving way, but with an intonation
which implied, &ldquo;Gracious heavens!&rdquo; He was a dark boy,
with narrow hips, who enjoyed the reputation throughout the
school of being a devil of a chap. The tone of the top class
this year was admirable. The obligations which membership
of Klaus Heinrich's class entailed had been impressed on
every boy from various quarters, and Klaus Heinrich was
not the boy to tempt them to forget these obligations. But
that Anselm Schickedanz was a devil of a chap had often come
to his ears, and Klaus Heinrich, when he looked at him,
felt a kind of satisfaction in believing what he heard, although
it was an obscure problem to him how he could have come
by his reputation.</p>

<p>He made several inquiries privately, broached the subject
apparently by chance, and tried to find out from one or other
of his comrades something about Schickedanz's devilry. He
discovered nothing definite. But the answers, whether disparaging
or complimentary, filled him with the suspicion of
a mad amiability, an unlawful glorious humanity, which was
there for the eyes of all, save his own, to see&mdash;and this suspicion
was almost a sorrow. Everybody said at once, with
reference to Anselm Schickedanz, and in saying it dropped
into the forbidden form of address: &ldquo;Yes, Highness, you
ought to see him when you are not there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich would never see him when he was not there,
would never get near him, never get to know him. He stole
peeps at him when he stood with the others in a semicircle
before him, laughing and braced up like all the rest. Everybody
braced himself up in Klaus Heinrich's presence, his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
very existence was accountable for that, as he well knew, and
he would never see what Schickedanz was like, how he behaved
when he let himself go. At the thought he felt a twinge of
envy, a tiny spark of regret.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>At this juncture something painful, in fact revolting, occurred,
of which nothing came to the ears of the Grand
Ducal couple, because Doctor Ueberbein kept his mouth
closed and about which scarcely any rumour spread in the
capital because everybody who had had a share or any responsibility
in the matter, obviously from a kind of feeling of
shame, preserved strict silence about it. I refer to the improprieties
which occurred in connexion with Prince Klaus
Heinrich's presence at that year's citizens' ball, and in which
a Fräulein Unschlitt, daughter of the wealthy soap-boiler,
was especially concerned.</p>

<p>The citizens' ball was a chronic fixture in the social life
of the capital, an official and at the same time informal
festivity, which was given by the city every winter in the
&ldquo;Townpark Hotel,&rdquo; a big, recently enlarged and renovated
establishment in the southern suburbs, and provided the
bourgeois circles with an opportunity of establishing friendly
relations with the Court. It was known that Johann Albrecht&nbsp;III
had never cultivated a taste for this civil and rather free-and-easy
entertainment, at which he appeared in a black frock-coat
in order to lead off the polonaise with the Lady
Mayoress, and that he was wont to withdraw from it at the
earliest possible moment. This only heightened the general
satisfaction when his second son, although not yet bound to
do so, already made his appearance at the ball that year&mdash;indeed,
it became known that he did so at his own express
request. It was said that the Prince had employed Excellency
von Knobelsdorff to transmit his earnest wish to the Grand
Duchess, who in her turn had contrived to obtain her husband's
consent.</p>

<p>Outwardly the festivity pursued its wonted course. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
most distinguished guests, Princess Catherine, in a coloured
silk dress and cap, accompanied by her red-haired children,
Prince Lambert with his pretty wife, and last of all Johann
Albrecht and Dorothea with Prince Klaus Heinrich, made their
appearance in the &ldquo;Townpark Hotel,&rdquo; greeted by city officials,
with long-ribboned rosettes pinned on their coats. Several
Ministers, aides-de-camp in mufti, numbers of men and women
of the Court, the leaders of society, as well as landowners
from the surrounding country, were present. In the big
white hall the Grand Ducal pairs first received a string of
presentations, and then, to the strains of the band which
sat in the curved gallery up above, Johann Albrecht with the
Lady Mayoress, Dorothea with the Lord Mayor, opened the
ball by a procession round the room.</p>

<p>Then, while the polonaise gave place to a round dance,
contentment spread, cheeks glowed, the heat of the throng
kindled feelings of fondness, faintness, and foreboding among
the dancers, the distinguished guests stood as distinguished
guests are wont to stand on such occasions&mdash;apart and smiling
graciously on the platform, at the top of the hall under
the gallery. From time to time Johann Albrecht engaged
a distinguished man, and Dorothea engaged his wife, in conversation.
Those addressed stepped quickly and smartly forward
and back, kept their distance half-bowing with their
heads bent, nodded, shook their heads, laughed in this attitude
at the questions and remarks addressed to them&mdash;answered
eagerly on the spur of the moment, with sudden and
anticipatory changes from hearty amusement to the deepest
earnestness, with a passionateness which was doubtless unusual
to them, and obviously in a state of tension. Curious
guests, still panting from the dance, stood in a semicircle
round and stared at these purposely trivial conversations with
a peculiarly tense expression on their faces.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was the object of much attention. Together
with two red-headed cousins who were already in the army,
but were wearing mufti that evening, he kept a little behind
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
his parents, resting on one leg, his left hand placed far back
on his hip, his face turned with his right half-profile to the
public. A reporter of the <i>Courier</i> who had been bidden to
the ball made notes upon him in a corner. The Prince could
be seen to greet with his white-gloved right hand his tutor,
Doctor Ueberbein, who with his red beard and greenish tint
came along the fence of spectators; he was seen even to advance
some way into the hall to meet him.</p>

<p>The doctor, with big enamel studs in his shirt front, began
by bowing when Klaus Heinrich stretched out his hand to
him, but then at once spoke to him in his free and fatherly
way. The Prince seemed to be rejecting a proposal, and
laughed uneasily as he did so, but then a number of people
distinctly heard Doctor Ueberbein say: &ldquo;No&mdash;nonsense,
Klaus Heinrich, what was the good of learning? Why did the
Swiss governess teach you your steps in your tenderest years?
I can't understand why you go to balls if you won't dance?
One, two, three, we'll soon find you a partner!&rdquo; And with a
continual shower of witticisms he presented to the Prince four
or five young maidens, whom he dropped on without ceremony
and dragged forward. They ducked and shot up again,
one after the other, in the trailing fluctuations of the Court
curtsey, set their teeth and did their best. Klaus Heinrich
stood with his heels together and murmured, &ldquo;Delighted, quite
delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To one he went so far as to say: &ldquo;It's a jolly ball, isn't
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Grand Ducal Highness, we are having great fun,&rdquo; answered
she in a high chirping voice. She was a tall, rather
bony bourgeoise maiden, dressed in white muslin, with fair
wavy hair dressed over a pad, and a pretty face, a gold chain
round her bare neck, the collar-bones of which showed prominently,
and big white hands in mittens. She added: &ldquo;The
quadrille is coming next. Will your Grand Ducal Highness
dance it with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I really don't know&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>He looked round. The machinery of the ball was already
falling into geometrical order. Lines were being drawn,
squares were forming, couples came forward and called to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>. The music had not yet started.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich asked his cousins. Yes, they were taking
part in the lancers, they already had their lucky partners on
their arms.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was seen to go up behind his mother's red
damask chair and whisper something excitedly to her, whereupon
she turned her lovely neck and passed on the question to
her husband, and the Grand Duke nodded. And then some
laughter was caused by the youthful impetuosity with which
the Prince ran down, so as not to miss the beginning of the
square dance.</p>

<p>The reporter of the <i>Courier</i>, notebook in one hand and pencil
in the other, peered with neck thrust forward over the hall
out of his corner, so as to make sure whom the Prince was
going to engage. It was the fair, tall girl, with the collar-bones
and the big white hands, Fräulein Unschlitt, the soap-boiler's
daughter. She was still standing where Klaus Heinrich
had left her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still there?&rdquo; he said breathlessly&hellip;. &ldquo;May I
have the pleasure? Come along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sets were complete. They wandered about for a while
without finding a place. A man with a ribbon rosette hurried
up, seized a pair of young people by the shoulders and induced
them to leave their stand under the chandelier, that his
Grand Ducal Highness might occupy it with Fräulein Unschlitt.
The band had been hesitating, it now struck up, the
prescribed compliments were exchanged, and Klaus Heinrich
danced like the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The doors into the next room stood open. In one of them
was a buffet with flower vases, punch bowls, and dishes of
many-coloured cakes. The dance extended right into this
room, two sets were dancing in it. In the other room some
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
white-covered tables were arrayed, which were still standing
empty.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich stepped forwards and backwards, laughed
to the others, stretched out his hand and grasped theirs, and
then again seized his partner's big white hand, put his right
arm round the maiden's muslin-clad waist and revolved with
her on their particular patch, while he kept his left hand,
which also wore a little white glove, on his hip. They laughed
and talked as they danced. The Prince made mistakes, forgot
himself, upset figures, and lost his place. &ldquo;You must keep
me straight!&rdquo; he said in the confusion. &ldquo;I'm upsetting everything!
Nudge me in the ribs!&rdquo; and the others gradually
plucked up courage and set him right, ordered him laughingly
hither and thither, even laid their hands on him and
pushed him a little when necessary. The fair damsel with
the collar-bones was particularly zealous in pushing him
about.</p>

<p>The spirits of the dancers rose with every figure. Their
movements became freer, their calls bolder, they began to
stamp their feet and to prance as they advanced and retired,
while they held each other's hands and balanced themselves
with their arms. Klaus Heinrich too stamped, at first only
by way of signal, but soon more loudly; and as far as the
balancing with the arms was concerned, the fair maiden looked
after that when they advanced together. Also every time
she danced facing him she made an exaggerated scrape before
him which much increased the merriment.</p>

<p>The refreshment room was full of chatter and babble, which
attracted everybody's envious glances. Some one had left
his set in the middle of the dance, purloined a sandwich from
the buffet, and was now chewing away proudly as he swerved
and stamped, to the amusement of the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheek!&rdquo; said the fair maiden. &ldquo;They don't stand
on ceremony!&rdquo; and the idea gave her no peace. Before you
could look round, she was off, had dashed lightly and nimbly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
between the lines of dancers, had seized a sandwich from the
buffet and was back in her place.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was the one who applauded her most heartily.
His left hand was a difficulty, and so he managed without
it, while with his right he beat on the top of his head and
doubled up with laughter. Then he became quieter and rather
pale. He was struggling with himself&hellip;. The quadrille
was nearing its end. What he meant to do he must do quickly.
They had already got to the grand chain.</p>

<p>And as he was already almost too late, he did what he
had been struggling with himself about. He broke away, ran
swiftly through the dancers, with muttered apologies when he
collided with anybody, reached the buffet, seized a sandwich,
rushed back, and came sliding into his set; that was not all,
he put the sandwich&mdash;it was an egg and sardine one&mdash;to the
lips of his partner, the damsel with the big white hands; she
curtseyed a little, bit into it, bit almost half off without using
her hands, and throwing back his head he stuffed the rest
into his mouth!</p>

<p>The high spirits of the set found a vent in the grand
chain, which was just beginning. Right round the hall went
the dancers, winding zig-zag in and out and stretching out
their hands. Then it stopped, the tide turned, and once more
the stream went round, laughing and chattering, with mistakes
and entanglements and hurriedly rectified complications.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich pressed the hands he grasped without knowing
to whom they belonged. He laughed and his chest heaved.
His smoothly parted hair was ruffled, and a bit fell over his
forehead, his shirt-front bulged a little out of his waistcoat,
and in his face and sparkling eyes was that look of tender
emotion which is sometimes the expression of happiness. He
said several times during the chain, &ldquo;What awful fun! What
glorious fun!&rdquo; He met his cousins, and to them too he said,
&ldquo;We have had such fun&mdash;in our set over there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the clapping and au revoirs; the dance was
over. Klaus Heinrich again stood facing the fair maiden
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
with the collar-bones, and when the music changed time he
once more put his arm round her tender waist, and away they
danced.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich did not steer well and often knocked into
other couples, because he kept his left hand planted on his
hip, but he brought his partner somehow or other to the entrance
to the refreshment room, where they called a halt and
refreshed themselves with pineappleade which was handed to
them by the waiters. They sat just at the entrance on two
velvet stools, drank and chatted about the quadrille, the Citizens'
Ball, and other social functions in which the fair
maiden had already taken part that winter&hellip;.</p>

<p>It was then that one of the suite, Major von Platow, the
Grand Duke's aide-de-camp, came up to Klaus Heinrich,
bowed and begged leave to <ins title="annouce">announce</ins> that their Royal Highnesses
were now going. He had been charged &hellip; But
Klaus Heinrich gave him to understand that he wished to remain,
in so emphatic a fashion that the aide-de-camp did not
like to insist upon his errand.</p>

<p>The Prince uttered exclamations of an almost rebellious
regret and was obviously bitterly grieved at the idea of going
home at once. &ldquo;We are having such fun!&rdquo; he said, stood
up and gripped the Major's arm gently. &ldquo;Dear Major von
Platow, please do intercede for me! Talk to Excellency von
Knobelsdorff, do anything you like&mdash;but to go now, when
we are all having such fun together! I'm sure my cousins
are going to stay&hellip;.&rdquo; The Major looked at the fair
maiden with the big white hands, who smiled at him; he too
smiled and promised to do his best. This little scene was
enacted while the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess were
already taking leave of the city dignitaries at the entrance
into the town park. Immediately afterwards the dancing on
the first floor began again.</p>

<p>The ball was at its height. Everything official had gone,
and the king of revelry came into his own. The white-covered
tables in the adjoining rooms were occupied by families
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
drinking punch and eating supper. Youth streamed to
and fro, sitting excitedly and impatiently on the edges of the
chairs to eat a mouthful, drink a glass, and again plunge
into the merry throng. On the ground-floor there was an
old-German beer-cellar, which was crowded with the more
sedate men. The big dancing-hall and the buffet-room were
by now monopolized by the dancers. The buffet-room was
filled with fifteen or sixteen young people, sons and daughters
of the city, among them Klaus Heinrich. It was a kind of
private ball in there. They danced to the music which floated
in from the main hall.</p>

<p>Doctor Ueberbein, the Prince's tutor, was seen there for a
minute or two, having a short talk with his pupil. He was
heard to mention, watch in hand, Herr von Knobelsdorff's
name, and to say that he was down in the beer-cellar and was
coming back to take the Prince away. Then he went. The
time was half-past ten. And while he sat below and conversed
with his friends over a tankard of beer, only for an hour or
perhaps an hour and a half, not more, those dreadful things,
that simply incredible scandal, happened in the buffet-room,
to which it fell to him to put a stop, though unfortunately
too late.</p>

<p>The punch provided was weak, it contained more soda-water
than champagne, and if the young people lost their
equilibrium it was more the intoxication of the dance than of
the wine. But in view of the Prince's character and the solid
bourgeois origin of the rest of the company, that was not
enough to explain what happened. Another, a peculiar intoxication,
was a factor here on both sides. The peculiar thing
was that Klaus Heinrich was fully conscious of each separate
stage in this intoxication, and yet had not the power or the
will to shake it off.</p>

<p>He was happy. He felt on his cheeks the same glow burning
as he saw in the faces of the others, and as his eyes, dazed
by a soft mist, travelled about the room, and rested admiringly
on one fair form after another, his look seemed to say:
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
&ldquo;We!&rdquo; His mouth too said it&mdash;said, for the pure joy of saying
them, sentences in which a &ldquo;We&rdquo; occurred. &ldquo;Shall <em>we</em>
sit down? shall <em>we</em> have another turn? shall <em>we</em> have a drink?
shall <em>we</em> make up two sets?&rdquo; It was especially to the maiden
with the collar-bones that Klaus Heinrich made remarks with
a &ldquo;We&rdquo; in them. He had quite forgotten his left hand, it
hung down, he felt so happy that it did not worry him and
he never thought of hiding it. Many saw now for the first
time what really was the matter with it, and looked curiously
on with an unconscious grimace at the thin, short arm in the
sleeve, the little, by now rather dirty white kid glove which
covered the hand. But as Klaus Heinrich was so careless
about it, the others plucked up courage, the result being
that everybody took hold of the malformed hand quite unconcernedly
in the round or square dances.</p>

<p>He did not keep it back. He felt himself borne along, nay
rather whirled around by a feeling, a strong, wild feeling of
contentment, that grew, gathered heat from itself, possessed
itself of him more and more recklessly, overpowered him even
more vehemently and breathlessly, seemed to lift him triumphantly
from the floor. What was happening? It was difficult
to say, difficult to be quite sure. The air was full of words,
detached cries, not spoken but expressed on the dancers'
faces, in their attitudes, in all they were doing and saying.
&ldquo;He must just once! Bring him along, bring him
along&nbsp;&hellip;! Caught, caught!&rdquo; A young damsel with a
turned-up nose, who asked him for a gallop when the &ldquo;leap-year&rdquo;
dance came, said quite clearly without any obvious
connexion, &ldquo;Chucker up!&rdquo; as she got ready to start off with
him.</p>

<p>He saw pleasure in every eye, and saw that their pleasure
lay in drawing him out, in having him amongst them. In his
happiness, his dream, to be with them, amongst them, one of
them, there obtruded itself from time to time a cold, uncomfortable
feeling that he was deluding himself, that the warm,
glorious &ldquo;We&rdquo; was deceiving him, that he did not really
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
blend in with them, that he was all the time the centre and
object of the show, but in a different and more unsatisfactory
way than before. They were his enemies to a certain extent,
he saw it in the malice of their eyes. He heard as if at a
distance, with a peculiar dismay, how the fair damsel with
the big white hands called him simply by his names&mdash;and he
felt that she did so in quite a different spirit to that of Doctor
Ueberbein when he did the same. She had the right and the
permission to do so, in a certain manner, but was nobody here
then jealous for his dignity, if he himself was not? It
seemed to him that they plucked at his coat, and sometimes in
their excitement made wild, sneering remarks about him. A
tall, fair young man with pince-nez, with whom he collided
while dancing, said quite loud so that everybody could hear
it: &ldquo;Now then, clumsy!&rdquo; And there was malice in the way
in which the fair young maiden, her arm in his and a grin
on her lips, whirled round with him till he was ready to drop
with giddiness. While they whirled he gazed with swimming
eyes at the collar-bones showing under the white, rather rough
skin on her neck.</p>

<p>They fell; they had gone too hard at it and tumbled when
they tried to stop revolving, and over them stumbled a second
pair, not entirely by themselves, but rather at a push from
the tall young man with pince-nez. There was a scrimmage
on the floor, and Klaus Heinrich heard above him in the
room the chorus which came back to him from the school-playground
when he had ventured on a rather daring joke
by way of amusing his fellows&mdash;a &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; only it
sounded more wicked and bolder here&hellip;.</p>

<p>When shortly after midnight, unfortunately a little behind
time, Doctor Ueberbein appeared on the threshold of the
buffet-room, this is what he saw: His young pupil was sitting
alone on the green plush sofa by the left-hand wall, his
clothes all disarranged and himself decorated in an extraordinary
way. A quantity of flowers, which had previously
adorned the buffet in two Chinese vases, were stuck in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
opening of his waistcoat, between the studs of his shirtfront,
even in his collar; round his neck lay the gold chain which
belonged to the maiden with the collar-bones, and on his head
the flat metal cover of a punch-bowl was balanced like a
hat. He kept saying, &ldquo;What are you doing? What are you
doing&nbsp;&hellip;?&rdquo; while the dancers, hand-in-hand in a semicircle,
danced a round dance backwards and forwards in
front of him with half-suppressed giggles, whispers, smirks,
and ho, ho, ho's.</p>

<p>An unusual and unnatural flush mantled in Doctor Ueberbein's
face. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; he cried in his resonant
voice, and, in the silence, consternation, and dismay which
at once ensued, he walked with long strides up to the Prince,
tore away the flowers in two or three grasps, threw the chain
and the cover away, then bowed and said with a stern look,
&ldquo;May I beg your Grand Ducal Highness&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been an ass, an ass!&rdquo; he repeated when he got outside.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich left the Citizens' Ball in his company.</p>

<p>That was the painful event which happened during Klaus
Heinrich's year at school. As I have said, none of the participators
talked about it; even to the Prince, Doctor Ueberbein
did not mention the subject for years afterwards, and,
as nobody crystallized the event in words, it remained incorporeal
and promptly faded away, at least apparently,
into oblivion.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The Citizens' Ball had taken place in January. Shrove
Tuesday, with the Court Ball and the big Court in the Old
Schloss, which wound up the social year&mdash;regulation festivities,
to which Klaus Heinrich was not yet admitted&mdash;were
past and over. Then came Easter, and with it the close of the
school year. Klaus Heinrich's diploma examination, that
edifying formality, in the course of which the question, &ldquo;You
agree, do you not, Grand Ducal Highness?&rdquo; was constantly
recurring on the lips of the Professor, and at which the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
Prince acquitted himself admirably in his very conspicuous
position. This was not a very important phase in his life.
Klaus Heinrich continued to live in the capital, but after
Whitsuntide his eighteenth birthday drew near, and with it
a complex of festivities which marked a serious turning-point
in his life, and which taxed him severely for days
together.</p>

<p>He had attained his majority, had been pronounced to be
of age. For the first time again since his baptism, he was
the centre of attention and chief actor in a great ceremony,
but while he had then quietly, irresponsibly, and patiently
resigned himself to the formalities which surrounded and
protected him, it was incumbent on him on this day, in the
midst of binding prescriptions and stern regulations, hemmed
in by the drapery of weighty precedent, to inspire the spectators
and to please them by maintaining an attitude of dignity
and good-breeding, and at the same time to appear light-hearted.</p>

<p>It may be added that I use the word &ldquo;drapery&rdquo; not only
as a figure of speech. The Prince wore a crimson mantle on
this occasion, a sumptuous and theatrical article of raiment,
which his father and grandfather before him had worn at
their coming-of-age, and which notwithstanding days of airing,
still smelt of camphor. The crimson mantle had originally
belonged to the robes of the Knights of the Grimmburg
Griffin, but was now nothing more than a ceremonial garb
for the use of princes attaining their majority. Albrecht,
the Heir Apparent, had never worn the family one. As his
birthday fell in the winter, he always spent it in the South,
in a place with a warm and dry climate, whither he was
thinking of returning this autumn too, and as at the time of
his eighteenth birthday his health had not permitted him to
travel home, it had been decided to declare him officially of
age in his absence, and to dispense with the Court ceremony.</p>

<p>As to Klaus Heinrich, there was only one opinion, especially
among the representatives of the public, that the mantle
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
suited him admirably, and he himself, notwithstanding the
way in which it hampered his movements, found it a blessing,
as it made it easy for him to hide his left hand. Between
the canopied bed and the bellying chest of drawers in his
bedroom, that was situated on the second floor looking out
on the yard with the rose-bush, he made himself ready for
the show, carefully and precisely, with the help of his valet,
Neumann, a quiet and precise man who had been recently
attached to him as keeper of his wardrobe and personal
servant.</p>

<p>Neumann was an ex-barber, and was filled, especially in
the direction of his original calling, with that passionate conscientiousness,
that insatiable knowledge of the ideal, which
gives rise to the highest skill. He did not shave like any
ordinary shaver, he was not content to leave no stubble behind,
he shaved in such a way that every shadow of a beard,
every recollection of one, was removed, and without hurting
the skin he managed to restore to it all its softness and
smoothness. He cut Klaus Heinrich's hair exactly square
above the ears, and arranged it with all the assiduity required,
in his opinion, by this preparation for the Prince's
ceremonial appearance. He managed that the parting should
come over the left eye and run slanting back over the crown
of the head, so that no tufts or wisps should stick up on it;
he brushed the hair on the right side up from the forehead
into a prim crest on which no hat or helmet could make an impression.
Then Klaus Heinrich, with his help, squeezed
himself carefully into his uniform of lieutenant in the Grenadier
Guards, whose high-braided collar and tight fit favoured
a dignified bearing, put on the lemon-coloured silk band and
the flat gold chain of the House Order, and went down to the
picture gallery where the members of the family and the
foreign relations of the Grand Ducal pair were waiting.
The Court was waiting in the adjoining Hall of the Knights,
and it was there that Johann Albrecht himself invested his
son with the crimson mantle.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>Herr von Bühl zu Bühl had marshalled a procession, the
ceremonial procession from the Hall of the Knights to the
Throne-room. It had cost him no little worry. The composition
of the Court made it difficult to contrive an impressive
arrangement, and Herr von Bühl especially lamented
the lack of upper Court officials, which on such occasions
made itself most severely felt. The Royal Mews had recently
been put under Herr von Bühl, and he felt himself quite up
to his various functions, but he asked everybody how he
could be expected to make a good impression, when the most
important posts were filled simply by the master of the Buck-hounds,
von Stieglitz, and the director of the Grand Ducal
Theatre, a gouty general.</p>

<p>While he, in his capacity as Lord Marshal, Chief Master of
the Ceremonies, and House Marshal, in his embroidered
clothes and brown toupée, covered with orders and with his
golden pince-nez on his nose, came waddling and planting
his long staff in front of him behind the cadets, who, dressed
as pages, and their hair parted over the left eye, opened the
procession, he pondered deeply over what came behind him.
A few chamberlains&mdash;not many, for some were wanted for
the end of the procession&mdash;their plumed hats under their
arms and the Key on their coat-tails, followed close at his
heels, in silk stockings. Next came Herr von Stieglitz, and
the limping theatre-director in front of Klaus Heinrich, who,
in his mantle between the exalted couple, and followed by
his brother and sister, Albrecht and Ditlinde, formed the
actual nucleus of the procession.</p>

<p>Behind their Highnesses came von Knobelsdorff, the House
Minister and President of Council, his eye-wrinkles all at
work; a little knot of aides-de-camp and palace ladies came
next: General Count Schmettern and Major von Platow, a
Count Trümmerhauff, cousin of the Keeper of the Privy Purse,
as military aide-de-camp of the Heir Apparent, and the
Grand Duchess's women led by the short-winded Baroness
von Schulenburg-Tressen. Then followed, attended and followed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
by aides-de-camp, chamberlains, and Court ladies, Princess
Catherine, with her red-haired progeny, Prince Lambert
with his lovely wife, and the foreign relations or their representatives.
Pages brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Thus they went at a measured pace from the Hall of the
Knights through the Gala Halls, the Hall of the Twelve Months,
and the Marble Hall into the Throne-room. Lackeys, with
red-gold aiguillettes on their brown coats, stood theatrically
in couples at the open double doors. Through the broad
windows the June morning sun streamed gaily and recklessly
in.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked round him as he processed between
his parents through the dreary arabesques, the dilapidated
decorations of the show-rooms, now not favoured by
kindly artificial light. The bright daylight cheerfully and
soberly showed up their decay. From the big lustres with
their stiff-bound stems, stripped of their coverings in honour
of the day, rose thick forests of flameless candles, but everywhere
there were prisms missing, crystal festoons torn, so
that they gave a canker-bit and toothless impression. The
silk damask upholstery of the State furniture, which was arranged
stiffly and monotonously round the walls, was thread-bare,
the gilt of the frames chipped off, big blind patches
marred the surfaces of the tall candle-decked mirrors, and
daylight shone through the moth-holes in the faded and discoloured
curtains. The gold and silver borders of the tapestry
hangings had torn away in several places, and were
hanging disconsolately from the walls. Even in the Silver
Hall of the Gala Rooms, where the Grand Duke was wont to
receive solemn deputations, and in the centre of which stood
a mother-of-pearl table with stumpy silver feet, a piece of
the silver work had fallen from the ceiling leaving a gaping
patch of white plaster.</p>

<p>But why was it that it somehow seemed as if these rooms
defied the sober, mocking daylight, and proudly answered
its challenge? Klaus Heinrich looked sideways at his father&hellip;.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
The condition of the rooms did not seem to worry
him. Never of more than medium height, the Grand Duke
had become almost small in the course of years, but he
strode majestically on with head thrown back, the lemon-coloured
ribbon of the Order over his general's uniform,
which he had donned to-day, though he had no military
leanings. From under his high and bald forehead and grey
eyebrows, his blue eyes, with dull rings round them, were
fixed with weary dignity on the distance, and from his pointed
white moustaches the two deep furrows ran down his yellowish
skin to his beard, imparting to his face a look of contempt.
No, the bright daylight could not do any harm to the rooms;
the dilapidations did not in the least impair their dignity,
they rather increased it. They stood in their discomfort,
their theatrical symmetry, their strange musty play-house
or church atmosphere, cold and indifferent to the merry and
sun-bathed world outside&mdash;stern background of a pompous
cult, at which Klaus Heinrich this day for the first time
officiated.</p>

<p>The procession passed through the pairs of lackeys, who,
with an expression of relentlessness, pressed their lips together
and closed their eyes, into the white and gold expanse of
the Throne-room. A wave of acts of homage, scrapings,
bows, curtseys and salutes, swept through the hall as the
procession passed in front of the assembled guests. There
were diplomats with their wives, nobility of the Court and
the country, the corps of officers of the capital, the Ministers,
amongst whom could be descried the affected, confident face
of the new Finance Minister, Dr. Krippenreuther, the Knights
of the Great Order of the Grimmburg Griffin, the Presidents
of the Diet, dignitaries of all kinds. High up in the little
box above the big looking-glass by the entrance door could
be descried the press representatives peering over each other's
shoulders and busily writing in their notebooks&hellip;. In front
of the throne-baldachin, itself a torn velvet arrangement,
crowned with ostrich feathers and framed with gold fillets
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
which would have been all the better for a touch-up, the
procession divided as in a polonaise, and went through carefully
prescribed evolutions.</p>

<p>The pages and chamberlains fell aside to right and left.
Herr von Bühl, his face turned to the throne and his staff
uplifted, stepped backwards and stood still in the middle of
the hall. The Grand Ducal pair and their children walked
up the rounded, red-carpeted steps to the capacious gilded
chairs which stood at the top. The remaining members of
the House, with the foreign princes, ranged themselves on
both sides of the throne; behind them stood the suite, the
maids of honour and the grooms of the chambers, and the
pages stood on the steps. At a gesture from Johann Albrecht,
Herr von Knobelsdorff, who had previously taken up his
stand over against the throne, advanced straight to the velvet-covered
table, which stood by the side of the steps, and began
at once to read from various documents the official formalities.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was declared to be of age and fit and
entitled to wear the crown, should necessity require it&mdash;every
eye was turned on him at this place, and at his Royal Highness
Albrecht, his elder brother, who stood close to him.
The Heir Apparent was wearing the uniform of a captain in
the Hussar regiment which was called by his name. From
his silver-laced collar stretched an unmilitary width of civil
stand-up collar, and on it rested his fine, shrewd, and delicate
head, with its long skull and narrow temples, the straw-coloured
moustache on the upper lip, and the blue, lonely-looking
eyes which had seen death. He looked not in the
least like a cavalry officer, yet so slender and unapproachably
aristocratic that Klaus Heinrich, with his national cheek-bones,
looked almost coarse beside him. The Heir Apparent pursed
up his lips when everybody looked at him, protruded his
short rounded underlip, and sucked it lightly against the
upper one.</p>

<p>Several of the country's orders were bestowed on the Prince
who had just come of age, including the Albrecht Cross and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
the Great Order of the Grimmburg Griffin, not to mention that
he was confirmed in the House Order whose insignia he had
possessed since his tenth birthday. Afterwards came the
congratulations in the form of a processional Court, led by
the fawning Herr von Bühl, after which the gala-breakfast
began in the Marble Hall and in the hall of the Twelve
Months.</p>

<p>The foreign princes were entertained for the next few days.
A garden-party was given in Hollerbrunn, with fireworks and
dancing for the young people of the Court in the park. Festive
excursions with pages in attendance were made through
the sunny country-side to Monbrillant, Jägerpreis, and Haderstein
Ruins, and the people, that inferior order of creation
with the searching eyes and the high cheek-bones, stood on the
kerb and cheered themselves and their representatives. In the
capital Klaus Heinrich's photograph hung in the windows of
the art-dealers, and the <i>Courier</i> actually published a printed
likeness of him, a popular and strangely idealized representation,
showing the Prince in the crimson mantle. But then
came yet another great day&mdash;Klaus Heinrich's formal entry
into the Army, into the regiment of Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p>This is what happened. The regiment to which fell the
honour of having Klaus Heinrich as one of its officers was
drawn up on the Albrechtsplatz in open square. Many a
plume waved in the middle. The princes of the House and
the generals were all present. The public, a black mass
against the gay background, crowded behind the barriers.
Cameras were levelled in several places at the scene of action.
The Grand Duchess, with the princesses and their ladies,
watched the show from the windows of the Old Schloss.</p>

<p>First of all, Klaus Heinrich, dressed as a lieutenant, reported
himself formally to the Grand Duke. He advanced
sternly, without the shadow of a smile, towards his father,
clapped his heels together and humbly acquainted him with
his presence. The Grand Duke thanked him briefly, also
without a smile, and then in his turn, followed by his aides-de-camp,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
advanced in his dress uniform and plumed hat into the
square. Klaus Heinrich stood before the lowered colours, an
embroidered, golden, and half-tattered piece of silk cloth, and
took the oath. The Grand Duke made a speech in detached
sentences and the sharp voice of command which he reserved
for such occasions, in which he called his son &ldquo;Your Grand
Ducal Highness&rdquo; and publicly clasped the Prince's hand.
The Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, with crimson cheeks,
led a cheer for the Grand Duke in which the guests, the regiment,
and the public joined. A march past followed, and
the whole ended with a military luncheon in the castle.</p>

<p>This picturesque ceremony in the Albrechtsplatz was without
practical significance; its effect began and ended there. Klaus
Heinrich never dreamed of going into garrison, but went the
very same day with his parents and brother and sister to Hollerbrunn,
to pass the summer there in the cool old French
rooms on the river, between the wall-like hedges of the park,
and then, in the autumn, to go up to the university. For so
it was ordained in the programme of his life; in the autumn
he went up to the university for a year, not that of the capital,
but the second one of the country, accompanied by Doctor
Ueberbein, his tutor.</p>

<p>The appointment of this young savant as mentor was once
more attributable to an express, ardent wish of the Prince,
and indeed, as far as the choice of tutor and older companions
was concerned, whom Klaus Heinrich was to have at his side
during this year of student freedom, it was considered necessary
to give a reasonable amount of consideration to his expressed
wishes. Yet there was much to be said against this
choice; it was unpopular, or at least criticized aloud or in
whispers in many quarters.</p>

<p>Raoul Ueberbein was not loved in the capital. Due respect
was paid to his medal for life-saving and to all his feverish
energy, but the man was no genial fellow-citizen, no jolly comrade,
no blameless official. The most charitable saw in him
an oddity with a determined and uncomfortably reckless disposition,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
who recognized no Sunday, no holiday, no relaxation,
and did not understand being a man amongst men after work
was done. This natural son of an adventuress had worked his
way up from the depths of society, from an obscure and prospectless
youth without means, by dint of sheer strength of will,
to being, first school teacher, then academic professor, then
university lecturer, had lived to see his appointment&mdash;had
&ldquo;engineered&rdquo; it, as many said&mdash;to the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo; as teacher
of a Grand Ducal Prince, and yet he knew no rest, no contentment,
no comfortable enjoyment of life&hellip;. But life, as
every decent man, thinking of Doctor Ueberbein, truly observed,
life does not consist only of profession and performance,
it has its purely human claims and duties, the neglect of
which is a greater sin than the display of some measure of
joviality towards oneself and one's fellows in the sphere of
one's work, and only that personality can be considered a
harmonious one which succeeds in giving its due to each part,
profession and human feelings, life and performance.</p>

<p>Ueberbein's lack of any sense of camaraderie was bound
to tell against him. He avoided all social intercourse with
his colleagues, and his circle of friends was confined to the
person of one man of another scientific sphere, a surgeon and
children's specialist with the unsympathetic name of Sammet,
a very popular surgeon to boot, who shared certain characteristics
with Ueberbein. But it was only very rarely&mdash;and
then only as a sort of favour&mdash;that he turned up at the club
where the teachers gathered after the day's work and worry,
for a glass of beer, a rubber, or a free exchange of views on
public and personal questions&mdash;but he passed his evenings,
and, as his landlady reported, also a great part of the night,
working at science in his study, while his complexion grew
greener and greener, and his eyes showed more and more
clearly signs of overstrain.</p>

<p>The authorities had been moved, shortly after his return
from the &ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo; to promote him to head master.
Where was he going to stop? At Director? High-school
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
Professor? Minister for Education? Everybody agreed
that his immoderate and restless energy concealed imprudence
and defiance of public opinion&mdash;or rather did not conceal
them. His demeanour, his loud, blustering mode of speaking
annoyed, irritated, and exasperated people. His tone towards
members of the teaching profession who were older and in
higher positions than himself was not what it should be. He
treated everybody, from the Director down to the humblest
usher, in a fatherly way, and his habit of talking of himself
as of a man who had &ldquo;knocked about,&rdquo; of gassing about &ldquo;Fate
and Duty,&rdquo; and thereby displaying his benevolent contempt
for all those who &ldquo;weren't obliged to&rdquo; and &ldquo;smoked cigars in
the morning,&rdquo; showed conceit pure and simple. His pupils
adored him; he achieved remarkable results with them, that
was agreed. But on the whole the Doctor had many enemies
in the town, more than he ever guessed, and the misgiving that
his influence on the Prince might be an undesirable one was
put into words in at least one portion of the daily press&hellip;.</p>

<p>Anyhow Ueberbein obtained leave from the Latin school,
and went first of all alone, in the capacity of billeter, on a
visit to the famous student town, within whose walls Klaus
Heinrich was destined to pass the year of his apprenticeship,
and on his return he was received in audience by Excellency
von Knobelsdorff, the Minister of the Grand Ducal House, to
receive the usual instructions. Their tenour was that almost
the most important object of this year was to establish traditions
of comradeship on the common ground of academic
freedom between the Prince and the student corps, especially
in the interests of the dynasty&mdash;the regulation phrases, which
Herr von Knobelsdorff rattled off almost casually, and which
Doctor Ueberbein listened to with a silent bow, while he drew
his mouth, and with it his red beard, a little to one side. Then
followed Klaus Heinrich's departure with his mentor, a dogcart
and a servant or two, for the university.</p>

<p>A glorious year, full of the charm of artistic freedom, in
the public eye and in the mirror of public report&mdash;yet without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
technical importance of any kind. Misgivings which had
been felt in some quarters that Doctor Ueberbein, through
mistaking and misunderstanding the position, might worry the
Prince with excessive demands in the direction of objective
science, proved unfounded. On the contrary, it was obvious
that the doctor quite realized the difference between his own
earnest, and his pupil's exalted, sphere of existence. On the
other hand (whether it was the mentor's or the Prince's own
fault does not matter) the freedom and the unconstrained
camaraderie, like the instruction, were interpreted in a very
relative and symbolical sense so that neither the one nor the
other, neither the knowledge nor the freedom, could be said to
be the essence and peculiarity of the year. Its essence and
peculiarity were rather, as it appeared, the year in itself, as
the embodiment of custom and impressive ceremoniousness,
to which Klaus Heinrich deferred, just as he had deferred
to the theatrical rites on his last birthday&mdash;only now not
with a purple cloak, but occasionally wearing a coloured
student's cap, the so-called &ldquo;Stürmer,&rdquo; in which he was
portrayed in a photograph issued at once by the <i>Courier</i> to
its readers.</p>

<p>As to his studies, his matriculation was not marked by any
particular festivities, though some reference was made to the
honour which Klaus Heinrich's admission bestowed on the
university, and the lectures he attended began with the address:
&ldquo;Grand Ducal Highness!&rdquo; He drove in his dogcart with a
groom from the pretty green-clad villa, which the Marshal
of his father's household had leased for him in a select and
not too expensive square, amid the remarks and greetings of
the passers-by, to the lectures, and there he sat with the consciousness
that the whole thing was unessential and unnecessary
for his exalted calling, yet with a show of courteous
attention.</p>

<p>Charming anecdotes of the signs the Prince gave of interest
in the lectures went about and had their due effect. Towards
the end of one course on Nature Study (for Klaus Heinrich attended
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
these courses also &ldquo;for general information&rdquo;) the
Professor, by way of illustration, had filled a metal shell
with water and announced that the water, when frozen, would
burst the shell by expansion; he promised to show the class
the pieces next lecture. Now he had not kept his word on
this point at the next lecture, probably out of forgetfulness:
the broken shell had not been forthcoming&mdash;Klaus Heinrich
had therefore inquired as to the result of the experiment.
He had joined in asking questions of the professor at the
end of the lecture, just like any ordinary student, and had
modestly asked him: &ldquo;Has the bomb burst?&rdquo;&mdash;whereupon
the Professor, full of embarrassment at first, had then expressed
his thanks with glad surprise, and indeed emotion,
for the kind interest the Prince had expressed in his lectures.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was honorary member of a student's club&mdash;only
honorary, because he was not allowed to fight duels&mdash;and
once or twice attended their wines, his Stürmer on
his head. But since his guardians were well aware that the
results the influence of strong drink had on his highly strung
and delicate temperament were absolutely irreconcilable with
his exalted calling, he did not dare to drink seriously, and
his comrades were obliged on this point too to bear his Highness
in mind. Their rude customs were judiciously limited
to a casual one or two, the general tone was as exemplary
as it used to be in the upper form at school, the songs they
sang were old ones of real poetry, and the meetings were,
as a whole, gala and parade nights, refined editions of the
ordinary ones. The use of Christian names was the bond of
union between Klaus Heinrich and his corps brothers, as the
expression and basis of spontaneous comradeship. But it
was generally observed that this use sounded false and artificial,
however great the efforts to make it otherwise, and that
the students were always falling back unintentionally into
the form of address which took due notice of the Prince's
Highness.</p>

<p>Such was the effect of his presence, of his friendly, alert,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
and always uncompromising attitude which sometimes produced
strange, even comical phenomena in the demeanour
of the persons with whom the Prince came into contact.
One evening, at a soirée which one of his professors gave,
he engaged a guest in conversation&mdash;a fat man of some age,
a King's Counsel by his title, who, despite his social importance,
enjoyed the reputation of a great roué and a regular
old sinner. The conversation, whose subject is a matter of
no consequence and indeed would be difficult to specify,
lasted for a considerable time because no opportunity of
breaking it off presented itself. And suddenly, in the middle
of his talk with the Prince, the barrister whistled&mdash;whistled
with his thick lips one of those pointless sequences of notes
which one utters when one is embarrassed and wants to appear
at one's ease, and then tried to cover his comic breach
of manners by clearing his throat and coughing. Klaus
Heinrich was accustomed to experiences of that kind, and
tactfully passed on.</p>

<p>If at any time he wanted to make a purchase himself and
went into a shop, his entrance caused a kind of panic. He
would ask for what he wanted, a button perhaps, but the girl
would not understand him, would look dazed, and unable to
fix her attention on the button, but obviously absorbed by
something else&mdash;something outside and above her duties as a
shop-assistant&mdash;she would drop a few things, turn the boxes
upside down in obvious helplessness, and it was all Klaus
Heinrich could do to restore her composure by his friendly
manner.</p>

<p>Such, as I have said, was the effect of his attitude, and
in the city it was often described as arrogance and blameworthy
contempt for fellow-creatures&mdash;others roundly denied
the arrogance, and Doctor Ueberbein, when the subject was
broached to him at a social gathering, would put the question,
whether &ldquo;every inducement to contempt for his fellow-creatures
being readily conceded,&rdquo; any such contempt really was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
possible in a case like the present of complete detachment
from all the activities of ordinary men. Indeed, any remark
of that kind he met in his unanswerable blustering way by
the assertion that the Prince not only did not despise his
fellow-creatures, but respected even the most worthless of
them, only considered them all the more sound, serious, and
good for the way in which the poor over-taxed and over-strained
man in the street earned his living by the sweat of
his brow&hellip;.</p>

<p>The society of the university town had no time to reach
a definite verdict on the question. The year of student life
was over before one could turn round, and Klaus Heinrich
returned, as prescribed by the programme of his life, to his
father's palace, there, despite his left arm, to pass a full
year in serious military service. He was attached to the
Dragoons of the Guard for six months, and directed the
taking up of intervals of eight paces for lance-exercises as
well as the forming of squares, as if he were a serious soldier;
then changed his weapon and transferred to the Grenadier
Guards, so as to get an insight into infantry work also.
It fell to him to march to the Schloss and change the Guard&mdash;an
evolution which attracted large crowds. He came
swiftly out of the Guard-room, his star on his breast, placed
himself with drawn sword on the flank of the company and
gave not quite correct orders, which, however, did not matter,
as his stout soldiers executed the right movements all the
same.</p>

<p>On guest-nights, too, at head-quarters, he sat on the colonel's
right hand, and by his presence prevented the officers from
unhooking their uniform collars and playing cards after
dinner. After this, being now twenty years old, he started
on an &ldquo;educational tour&rdquo;&mdash;no longer in the company of
Doctor Ueberbein, but in that of a military attendant and
courier, Captain von Braunbart-Schellendorf of the Guards,
a fair-haired officer who was destined to be Klaus Heinrich's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
aide-de-camp, and to whom the tour gave an opportunity of
establishing himself on a footing of intimacy and influence
with him.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich did not see much in his educational tour,
which took him far afield, and was keenly followed by the
<i>Courier</i>. He visited the courts, introduced himself to the
sovereigns, attended gala dinners with Captain von Braunbart,
and on his departure received one of the country's superior
Orders. He took a look at such sights as Captain von
Braunbart (who also received several Orders) chose for him,
and the <i>Courier</i> reported from time to time that the Prince
had expressed his admiration of a picture, a museum, or a
building to the director or curator who happened to be his
cicerone. He travelled apart, protected and supported by
the chivalrous precautions of Captain von Braunbart, who
kept the purse, and to whose devoted zeal was due the fact
that not one of Klaus Heinrich's trunks was missing at the
end of the journey.</p>

<p>A couple of words, no more, may be devoted to an interlude,
which had for scene a big city in a neighbouring kingdom,
and was brought about by Captain von Braunbart with all
due circumspection. The Captain had a friend in this city,
a bachelor nobleman and a cavalry captain, who was on
terms of intimacy with a young lady member of the theatrical
world, an accommodating and at the same time trustworthy
young person. In pursuance of an agreement by letter between
Captain von Braunbart and his friend, Klaus Heinrich
was thrown in contact with the damsel at her home&mdash;suitably
arranged for the purpose&mdash;and the acquaintance allowed to
develop <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à deux</i>. Thus an expressly foreseen item in the
educational tour was conscientiously realized, without Klaus
Heinrich being involved in more than a casual acquaintance.
The damsel received a memento for her services, and Captain
von Braunbart's friend a decoration. So the incident closed.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich also visited the fair Southern lands, incognito,
under a romantic-sounding title. There he would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>
sit, alone, perhaps for a quarter of an hour, dressed in a
suit of irreproachable cut, among other foreigners on a white
restaurant terrace looking over a dark-blue sea, and it might
happen that somebody at another table would notice him,
and try, in the manner of tourists, to engage him in conversation.
What could he be, that quiet and self-possessed-looking
young man? People ran over the various spheres
of life, tried to fit him into the merchant, the military, the
student class. But they never felt that they had got it quite
right&mdash;they felt his Highness, but nobody guessed it.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>V<br/>
<small>ALBRECHT&nbsp;II</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Grand Duke Johann Albrecht</span> died of a terrible illness,
which had something naked and abstract about it, and to
which no other name but just that of death could be given.
It seemed as if death, sure of its prey, in this case disdained
any mask or gloss, and came on the scene as its very self,
as dissolution by and for itself. What actually happened
was a decomposition of the blood, caused by internal hæmorrhages;
and an exploratory operation, <ins title="whch">which</ins> was conducted
by the Director of the University Hospital, a famous surgeon,
could not arrest the corroding progress of the gangrene. The
end soon came, all the sooner that Johann Albrecht made little
resistance to the approach of death. He showed signs of an
unutterable weariness, and often remarked to his attendants,
as well as to the surgeons attending him, that he was &ldquo;dead
sick of the whole thing&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, of course, his princely
existence, his exalted life in the glare of publicity. His
cheek-furrows, those two lines of arrogance and boredom,
resolved in his last days into an exaggerated, grotesque grimace,
and continued thus until death smoothed them out.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke's illness fell in the winter. Albrecht, the
Heir Apparent, called away from his warm dry resort, arrived
in snowy wet weather, which was as bad for his health as it
could be. His brother, Klaus Heinrich, interrupted his educational
tour, which was anyhow nearing its close, and returned
with Captain von Braunbart-Schellendorf in all haste
from the fair land of the South to the capital. Besides the
two prince-sons, the Grand Duchess Dorothea, the Princesses
Catherine and Ditlinde, Prince Lambert without his lovely
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
wife&mdash;the surgeons in attendance and Prahl the valet-de-chambre
waited at the bedside, while the Court officials and
Ministers on duty were collected in the adjoining room. If
credence might be given to the assertions of the servants, the
ghostly noise in the &ldquo;Owl Chamber&rdquo; had been exceptionally
loud in the last weeks and days. According to them it was
a rattling and a shaking noise, which recurred periodically,
and whose meaning could not be distinguished outside the
room.</p>

<p>Johann Albrecht's last act of Highness consisted in giving
with his own hand to the professor, who had performed the
useless operation with the greatest skill, his patent of nomination
to the Privy Council. He was terribly exhausted, &ldquo;sick
of the whole thing,&rdquo; and his consciousness even in his more
lucid moments was not at all clear; but he carried out the
act with scrupulous care and made a ceremony of it. He had
himself propped up, made a few alterations, shading his eyes
with his wax-coloured hands, in the chance disposition of those
present, ordered his sons to place themselves on both sides
of his canopied bed&mdash;and while his soul was already tugging
at her moorings, and floating here and there on unknown
currents, he composed his features with mechanical skill into
his smile of graciousness for the handing of the diploma to
the Professor, who had left the room for a short time.</p>

<p>Quite towards the end, when the dissolution had already
attacked the brain, the Grand Duke made one wish clear,
which, though scarcely understood, was hastily complied with,
although its fulfilment could not do the slightest good to the
Grand Duke. Certain words, apparently disconnected, kept
recurring in the murmurings of the sick man. He named
several stuffs, silk, satin, and brocade, mentioned Prince Klaus
Heinrich, used a technical expression in medicine, and said
something about an Order, the Albrecht Cross of the Third
Class with Crown. Between whiles one caught quite ordinary
remarks, which apparently referred to the dying man's princely
calling, and sounded like &ldquo;extraordinary obligation&rdquo; and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
&ldquo;comfortable majority&rdquo;; then the descriptions of the stuffs
began again, to which was appended in a louder voice the
word &ldquo;Sammet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> At last it was realized that the Grand
Duke wanted Doctor Sammet to be called in, the doctor who
had happened to be present at the Grimmburg at the time of
Klaus Heinrich's birth, twenty years before, and had, for a
long time now, been practising in the capital.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">(1)</a>
<i>I.e.</i>, velvet.
</p>
</div>

<p>The doctor was really a children's doctor, but he was summoned
and came: already nearly grey on the temples, with a
drooping moustache, surmounted by a nose which was rather
too flat at the bottom, clean-shaven otherwise and with cheeks
rather sore from shaving. With head on one side, his hand
on his watch-chain, and elbows close to his sides, he examined
the situation, and began at once to busy himself in a practical,
gentle way about his exalted patient, whereat the latter expressed
his satisfaction in no uncertain fashion. Thus it was
that it fell to Doctor Sammet to administer the last injections
to the Grand Duke, with his supporting hand to ease the final
spasms, and to be, more than any of the other doctors, his
helper in death&mdash;a distinction which indeed provoked some
secret irritation amongst the others, but on the other hand
resulted in the doctor's appointment shortly afterwards to the
vacancy in the important post of Director and Chief Physician
of the &ldquo;Dorothea,&rdquo; a Children's Hospital, in which capacity
he was destined later to play some part in certain developments.</p>

<p>So died Johann Albrecht the Third, uttering his last sigh
on a winter's night. The old castle was brightly illuminated
while he was passing away. The stern furrows of boredom
were smoothed out in his face, and, relieved of any exertion
on his own part, he was subjected to formalities which surrounded
him for the last time, carried him along, and made
his wax-like shell just once more the focus and object of
theatrical rites&hellip;. Herr von Bühl zu Bühl showed his usual
energy in organizing the funeral, which was attended by many
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
princely guests. The gloomy ceremonies, the different exposures
and identifications, corpse-parades, blessings, and
memorial services at the catafalque took days to complete, and
Johann Albrecht's corpse was for eight hours exposed to public
view, surrounded by a guard of honour consisting of two
colonels, two first lieutenants, two cavalry sergeants, two infantry
sergeants, two corporals, and two chamberlains.</p>

<p>Then at last came the moment when the zinc shell was
brought by eight lackeys from the altar recess of the Court
Church, where it had been on show between crape-covered
candelabra and six-foot candles, to the entry-hall, placed by
eight foresters in the mahogany coffin, carried by eight
Grenadier Guardsmen to the six-horsed and black-draped
hearse, which set off for the mausoleum amidst cannon salvos
and the tolling of bells. The flags hung heavy with rain
from the middle of their poles. Although it was early morning,
the gas-lamps were burning in the streets along which the
funeral was to pass. Johann Albrecht's bust was displayed
amongst mourning decorations in the shop-windows, and postcards
with the portrait of the deceased ruler, which were everywhere
for sale, were in great demand. Behind the rows of
troops, the gymnastic clubs, and veteran associations which
kept the road, stood the people on tiptoe in the snow-brash
and gazed with bowed heads at the slowly passing coffin, preceded
by the wreath-bearing lackeys, the Court officials, the
bearers of the insignia and Dom Wislezenus, the Court preacher,
and covered with a silver-worked pall, whose corners were
held by Lord Marshal von Bühl, Master of the Royal Hunt
von Stieglitz, Adjutant-General Count Schmettern, and Minister
of the Household von Knobelsdorff.</p>

<p>By the side of his brother Klaus Heinrich, immediately
behind the charger which was led in rear of the hearse, and
at the head of the other mourners, walked Grand Duke
Albrecht&nbsp;II. His clothes, the tall stiff plume in the front of
his busby, the long boots under his gaudy, ample Hussar's
pelisse, with the crape band, did not become him. He walked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
as if embarrassed by the eyes of the crowd, and his shoulder-blades,
naturally rather crooked, were twisted in an awkward
nervous way as he walked. Repugnance at having to be chief
actor in this funeral pomp was clearly written on his pale face.
He did not raise his eyes as he walked, and he sucked his
short rounded lower lip against the upper&hellip;.</p>

<p>His demeanour remained the same during the Curialia accompanying
his accession, which were so arranged as to spare
him as much as possible. The Grand Duke signed the oath
in the Silver Hall of the Gala Rooms before the assembled
Ministers, and read aloud in the Throne-room, standing in
front of the rounded chair under the baldachin, the Speech from
the Throne, which Herr von Knobelsdorff had drawn up.
The economic condition of the country was touched upon in it
with earnestness and delicacy, while appreciative mention was
made of the unanimity which despite all troubles existed between
the princes and the country&mdash;at which place a prominent
functionary, who was apparently discontented about promotion,
was said to have whispered to his neighbour that the unanimity
consisted in the Prince being as deeply in debt as the country&mdash;a
caustic remark which was much repeated, and ended by
getting into hostile newspapers&hellip;. To end up, the President
of the Landtag called for a cheer for the Grand Duke, a service
was held in the Court Chapel, and that was all.</p>

<p>Further, Albrecht signed an edict, by virtue of which a
number of sentences of fines and imprisonment, which had
been imposed for the less serious misdemeanours, chiefly infringement
of the forest laws, were remitted. The solemn procession
through the city and the acclamation in the Town Hall
were omitted altogether, as the Grand Duke felt too tired for
them. Having been a captain hitherto, he was promoted on
the occasion of his accession at once to the colonelcy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la
suite</i> of his Hussar regiment, but scarcely ever put the uniform
on, and kept as far away as possible from his sphere as
a soldier. He made no change whatever in his staff, perhaps
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
out of respect to his father's memory, either among the Court
appointments or in the Ministry.</p>

<p>The public saw him but rarely. His proud and bashful
disinclination to show himself, to put himself forward, to
allow others to acclaim him, was so clearly shown from the
very beginning as to shock public opinion. He never appeared
in the large box at the Court Theatre. He never took
part in the park parade. When in residence at the Old Schloss,
he had himself driven in a closed carriage to a remote and
empty part of the suburbs, where he got out to take a little
exercise; and in the summer at Hollerbrunn he only left the
hedged walks of the parks on exceptional occasions.</p>

<p>Did the people catch a glimpse of him&mdash;at the Albrechtstor
it might be, when wrapped in his heavy fur coat, which his
father had worn before him, and on whose thick collar his
delicate head now rested, he stepped into his carriage&mdash;timid
glances were levelled at him, and the cheering was faint and
hesitating. For the lower classes felt that with a prince like
this there could be no question of cheering him and thereby
cheering themselves at the same time. They looked at him,
and did not recognize themselves in him; his refined superiority
made it clear that they were of different clay from his. And
they were not accustomed to that. Was there not a commissionaire
posted in the Albrechtsplatz that very day, who
with his high cheek-bones and grey whiskers looked a coarse
and homely replica of the late Grand Duke? And did one
not similarly meet with Prince Klaus Heinrich's features in
the lower classes?</p>

<p>It was not so with his brother. The people could not see
in him an idealized version of themselves, whom it could make
them happy to cheer&mdash;as it meant cheering themselves too!
the Grand Duke's Highness&mdash;his undoubted Highness!&mdash;was
a nobility of the usual kind, undomestic, and without the
stamp of the graciousness which inspires confidence. He
too knew that; and the consciousness of his Highness, together
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
with that of his want of popular graciousness, were quite
enough to account for his shyness and haughtiness. He began
already to delegate as far as possible his duties to Prince
Klaus Heinrich. He sent him to open the new spring at Immenstadt
and to the historical town-pageant at Butterburg.
Indeed, his contempt for any exhibition of his princely person
went so far that Herr von Knobelsdorff had the greatest difficulty
in persuading him to receive the Presidents of the two
Chambers in the Throne-room himself, and not, &ldquo;for reasons
of health,&rdquo; as he was minded, to give place to his brother
on this solemn occasion.</p>

<p>Albrecht&nbsp;II lived a lonely life in the Old Schloss; that
was unavoidable in the nature of things. In the first place,
Prince Klaus Heinrich, since Johann Albrecht's death, kept a
Court of his own. That was demanded by etiquette, and he
had been given the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; as a residence, that Empire
Schloss on the fringe of the northern suburbs, which, reposeful
and charming, but long uninhabited and neglected, in the
middle of its overgrown park next the Town Gardens, looked
down on its little mud-thick pond. Some time ago, when
Albrecht came of age, the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; had been freshened
up and for form's sake destined to be the Heir Apparent's
palace; but as Albrecht had always come in summer straight
from his warm, dry foreign resort to Hollerbrunn, he had
never used his palace&hellip;.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich lived there without unnecessary expense,
with one major-domo, who superintended the household, a
Baron von Schulenburg-Tressen, nephew of the Mistress of the
Robes. Besides his valet, Neumann, he had two other lackeys
for his daily needs; he borrowed the game-keeper when necessary
for ceremonial shoots, from the Grand Duke's Court.
One coachman and a couple of grooms in red waistcoats looked
after the carriages and horses, which consisted of one pony-cart,
one brougham, one dog-cart, two riding and two carriage
horses. One gardener, helped by two boys, looked after
the park and the garden; and one cook with her kitchen-maid,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
as well as two chambermaids, made up the female staff of the
&ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Court Marshal von Schulenburg's business to keep
his young master's establishment going on the apanage which
the Landtag, after Albrecht's accession, had voted the Grand
Duke's brother after a serious debate. It amounted to two
thousand five hundred pounds. For the sum of four thousand
pounds, which had been the original demand, had never
had any prospect of recommending itself to the Landtag, and
so a wise and magnanimous act of self-denial had been credited
to Klaus Heinrich, which had made an excellent impression
in the country. Every winter Herr von Schulenburg sold the
ice from the pond. He had the hay in the park mowed twice
every summer and sold. After the harvests the surface of the
fields looked almost like English turf.</p>

<p>Further, Dorothea, the Dowager Grand Duchess, no longer
lived in the Old Schloss, and the causes of her retirement were
both sad and uncomfortable. For she too, the Princess whom
the much-travelled Herr von Knobelsdorff had described more
than once as one of the most beautiful women he had ever
seen, the Princess whose radiant smiles had evoked joy, enthusiasm,
and cheers whenever she had shown herself to the
longing gaze of the toil-worn masses, she too had had to pay
her tribute to time. Dorothea had aged, her calm perfection,
the admiration and joy of everybody, had during recent years
withered so fast and steadily that the woman in her had been
unable to keep pace with the transformation. Nothing, no art,
no measures, even the painful and repulsive ones, with which
she tried to stave off decay, had availed to prevent the sweet
brightness of her deep blue eyes from fading, rings of loose
yellow skin from forming under them, the wonderful little
dimples in her cheeks from turning into furrows, and her
proud and hard mouth from looking drawn and bitter.</p>

<p>But since her heart had been hard as her beauty, and had
been absorbed in that beauty, since her beauty had been her
very soul and she had had no wish, no love, beyond the effect
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
of that beauty on the hearts of others, while her own heart
never beat the faster for anything or anyone, she was now disconsolate
and lost, could not accommodate herself to the change
and rebelled against it. Surgeon-General Eschrich said something
about mental disturbance resulting from an unusually
quick climacteric, and his opinion was undoubtedly correct in
a sense. The sad truth at any rate was that Dorothea during
the last years of her husband's life had already shown signs of
profound mental disturbance and trouble.</p>

<p>She became light-shy, gave orders that at the Thursday concerts
in the Marble Hall all the lights should be shaded red,
and flew into a passion because she could not have the same
thing done at all other festivities, the Court Ball, the Private
Ball, the Dinner Party, and the Great Court, as the kind of
twilight feeling in the Marble Hall had been enough by itself
to call forth many cutting remarks. She spent whole days
before her looking-glasses, and it was noticed that she fondled
with her hands those which for some reason or other reflected
her image in a more favourable light. Then again she had
all the looking-glasses removed from her rooms, and those
fixed in the wall draped, went to bed and prayed for death.</p>

<p>One day Baroness von Schulenburg found her quite distracted
and feverish with weeping in the Hall of the Twelve
Months before the big portrait which represented her at the
height of her beauty&hellip;. At the same time a diseased misanthropy
began to take possession of her, and both Court and
people were distressed to notice how the bearing of this erstwhile
goddess began to lose its assurance, her deportment became
strangely awkward, and a pitiful look came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>At last she shut herself up altogether, and, at the last Court
Ball he attended, Johann Albrecht had escorted his sister
Catherine instead of his &ldquo;indisposed Consort.&rdquo; His death was
from one point of view a release for Dorothea, as it relieved
her from all her duties as a sovereign. She chose as dower-house
Schloss Segenhaus, a monastic-looking old hunting-seat,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
which lay in a solemn park about one and a half hour's drive
from the capital, and had been decorated by some pious old
sportsman with religious and sporting emblems curiously intermixed.
There she lived, eclipsed and odd, and excursionists
could often watch her from afar, walking in the park with
Baroness von Schulenburg-Tressen, and bowing graciously to
the trees on each side of the path.</p>

<p>Lastly, Princess <ins title="Ditlande">Ditlinde</ins> had married at the age of twenty,
one year after her father's death. She bestowed her hand
on a prince of a mediatised house, Prince Philipp zu Ried-Hohenried,
a no longer young, but well-preserved, cultured
little man of advanced views, who paid her flattering attentions
for some considerable time, did all his courting at first-hand,
and offered the Princess his heart and hand in an honest
bourgeois way at a charity function.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to say that this alliance evoked wild
enthusiasm in the country. It was received with indifference;
it disappointed. It is true, more ambitious hopes had been
secretly entertained for Johann Albrecht's daughter, and all
the critics could say was that the marriage could not be called
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i> in so many words. It was a fact that Ditlinde,
in giving her hand to the Prince&mdash;which she did of her own
free will, and quite uninfluenced by others&mdash;had undoubtedly
descended out of her sphere of Highness into a more free and
human atmosphere. Her noble spouse was not only a lover and
collector of oil paintings, but also a business man and tradesman
on a large scale.</p>

<p>The dynasty had ceased to exercise any sovereign right hundreds
of years ago, but Philipp was the first of his house to
make up his mind to exploit his private means in a natural
way. After spending his youth in travelling, he had looked
around for a sphere of activity which would keep him busy
and contented, and at the same time (a matter of necessity)
would increase his income. So he launched out into various
enterprises, started farms, a brewery, a sugar factory, several
saw-mills on his property, and began to exploit his extensive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
peat deposits in a methodical way. As he brought expert
knowledge and sound business instincts to all his enterprises,
they soon began to pay, and returned profits which, if their
origin was not very princely, at any rate provided him with
the means of leading a princely existence which he would
otherwise not have had.</p>

<p>On the other hand the critics might have been asked what
sort of a match they could expect for their Princess, if they
viewed the matter soberly. Ditlinde, who brought her husband
scarcely anything except an inexhaustible store of linen,
including dozens of out-of-date and useless articles such as
night-caps and neckerchiefs, which however by hallowed
tradition formed part of her trousseau&mdash;she by this marriage
acquired a measure of riches and comfort such as she had
never been accustomed to at home: and no sacrifice of her
affections was necessary to pay for them. She took the step
into private life with obvious contentment and determination,
and retained, of the trappings of Highness, nothing but her
title. She remained on friendly terms with her ladies-in-waiting,
but divested her relations with them of everything
which suggested service, and avoided giving her household the
character of a Court.</p>

<p>That might evoke surprise, especially in a Grimmburg and
in Ditlinde in particular, but there was no doubt that it was
her own choice. The couple spent the summer on the princely
estates, the winter in the capital in the stately palace in the
Albrechtstrasse, which Philipp zu Ried had inherited; and it
was here, not in the Old Schloss, that the Grand Ducal family&mdash;Klaus
Heinrich and Ditlinde, occasionally Albrecht as well&mdash;met
now and again for a confidential talk.</p>

<p>So it happened that one day at the beginning of autumn,
not quite two years after the death of Johann Albrecht, the
<i>Courier</i>, well-informed as usual, published in its evening edition
the news that this afternoon his Royal Highness the
Grand Duke and his Grand Ducal Highness Prince Klaus
Heinrich had been to tea with her Grand Ducal Highness the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
Princess zu Ried-Hohenried. That was all. But on that afternoon
several topics of importance for the future were discussed
between the brothers and sister.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich left the Hermitage shortly before five
o'clock. As the weather was sunny, he had ordered the dogcart,
and the open brown-varnished vehicle, clean and shining,
if not over-new or smart to look at, came slowly up the broad
drive of the Schloss, at a quarter to five, from the stables,
which with their asphalt yard lay in the right wing of the
home farm. The home farm, yellow-painted, old-fashioned
buildings of one story, made one long line with, though at
some distance from, the plain white mansion, the front of
which, adorned with laurels at regular intervals, faced the
muddy pond and the public part of the park.</p>

<p>For the front portion of the estate, that which marched
with the town gardens, was open to pedestrians and light
traffic, and all that was enclosed was the gently rising flower-garden,
at the top of which lay the Schloss and the very unkempt
park behind, which was divided by hedges and fences
from the rubbish-encumbered waste ground at the edge of the
town suburbs. So the cart came up the drive between the
pond and the home farm, turned through the high garden
gates, adorned with lamps which had once been gilt, passed
on up the drive and waited in front of the stiff little laurel-planted
terrace which led to the garden-room.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich came out a few minutes before five. He
wore as usual the tight-fitting uniform of a lieutenant of the
Grenadier Guards, and his sword-hilt hung on his arm. Neumann,
in a violet coat whose arms were too short, ran in front
of him down the steps and with his red barber's hands packed
his master's folded grey over-coat into the cart. Then, while
the coachman, his hand to his cockaded hat, inclined a little
sideways on the box, the valet arranged the light carriage rug
over Klaus Heinrich's knees and stepped back with a silent
bow. The horses started off.</p>

<p>Outside the garden gates a few promenaders had collected.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
They greeted Klaus Heinrich, smiling with knitted brows and
hats lifted, and Klaus Heinrich thanked them by raising his
white-gloved right hand to the peak of his cap and making a
succession of lively nods.</p>

<p>They skirted a piece of waste ground along a birch avenue,
whose leaves were already turning, and then drove through
the suburb, between poverty-stricken houses, over unpaved
streets, where the ragged children left their hoops and tops for
a moment to gaze at the carriage with curious eyes. Some
cried, Hurrah! and ran for a while by the side of the carriage,
with heads turned towards Klaus Heinrich. The carriage
might have taken the road by the Spa-gardens; but that
through the suburb was shorter, and time pressed. Ditlinde
was particular on points of regularity, and easily put out if
anybody disturbed her household arrangements by unpunctuality.</p>

<p>Yonder was the Dorothea Children's Hospital of which Doctor
Sammet, Ueberbein's friend, was the Director; Klaus Heinrich
drove by it. And then the carriage left the squalid
neighbourhood and reached the Gartenstrasse, a stately tree-planted
avenue, in which lay the houses and villas of wealthy
citizens, and along which ran the tram-line from the Spa Gardens
to the centre of the city. The traffic here was fairly
heavy, and Klaus Heinrich was kept busy answering the greetings
which met him. Civilians took off their hats and looked
from under their eyebrows at him, officers on horse and on
foot saluted, policemen front-turned, and Klaus Heinrich in
his corner raised his hand to the peak of his cap and thanked
on both sides with the well-trained bow and smile which were
calculated to confirm the people in their feeling of participation
in his splendid personality&hellip;. His way of sitting in
his carriage was quite peculiar&mdash;he did not lean back indolently
and comfortably in the cushions, but he took just as active a
part in the motions of the carriage when driving as in those
of his horse when riding; with hands crossed on his sword
hilt and one foot a little advanced, he as it were &ldquo;took&rdquo; the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
unevennesses of the ground, and accommodated himself to the
motion of the badly hung carriage.</p>

<p>The carriage crossed the Albrechtsplatz, left the Old Schloss,
with the two sentries presenting arms, to the right, followed
the Albrechtstrasse in the direction of the barracks of the
Grenadier Guards and rolled to the left into the courtyard of
the palace of the Princess of Ried. It was a building of
regular proportions in the pedantic style, with a soaring gable
over the main door, festooned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&oelig;ils-de-b&oelig;uf</i> in the mezzanine
story, high French windows in the first story, and an elegant
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cour d'honneur</i>, which was formed by the two one-storied wings
and was separated from the street by a circular railing, on
whose pillars stone babies played. But the internal arrangements
of the Schloss were, in contradistinction to the historical
style of its exterior, conceived throughout in an up-to-date
and comfortable bourgeois taste.</p>

<p>Ditlinde received her brother in a large drawing-room on
the first floor with several curved sofas in pale green silk; the
back part of the room was separated from the front by slender
pillars, and filled with palms, plants in metal bowls, and tables
covered with brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Klaus Heinrich,&rdquo; said the Princess. She
was delicate and thin, and the only luxuriant thing about her
was her fair hair, which used to lie like ram's horns round her
ears and now was dressed in thick plaits above her face with its
high Grimmburg cheek-bones. She wore an indoor dress of
soft blue-grey stuff with a white lace collar, cut in a point like
a breast-plate and fastened at the waist with an old-fashioned
oval brooch. Blue veins and shadows showed here and there
through the delicate skin of her face, in the temples, the forehead,
at the corners of her soft and calm blue eyes. Signs of
approaching maternity were beginning to show themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Ditlinde, you and your flowers!&rdquo; answered
Klaus Heinrich, as, clapping his heels together, he bent over
her little, white, rather over-broad hand. &ldquo;How they do smell!
And the garden's full of them, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I love flowers. I have always longed to
be able to live among quantities of flowers, living, smelling
flowers, which I could watch growing&mdash;it was a kind of secret
wish of mine, Klaus Heinrich, and I might almost say that
I married for flowers, for in the Old Schloss, as you know,
there were no flowers&hellip;. The Old Schloss and flowers! We
should have had to rummage a lot to find them, I'm sure.
Rat-traps and such things, plenty of them. And really, when
one comes to think, the whole thing was like a disused rat-trap,
so dusty and horrid &hellip; ugh!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the rose-bush, Ditlinde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my goodness&mdash;one rose-bush. And that's in the guide-books,
because its roses smell of decay. And the books say
that it will one day smell quite natural and nice, just like any
other rose. But I can't believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon,&rdquo; he said, and looked at her laughingly,
&ldquo;have something better than your flowers to tend, little Ditlinde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said and blushed lightly and quickly, &ldquo;yes, Klaus
Heinrich, I can hardly believe it. And yet it will be so, if
God pleases. But come over here. We'll have a chat together
once more&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room, on whose threshold they had been talking, was
small in comparison with its height, with a grey-blue carpet,
and furnished with cheery-looking silver-grey furniture, the
chairs of which were upholstered in blue silk. A milk-white
china chandelier hung from the white-festooned centre of the
ceiling, and the walls were adorned with oil paintings of
various sizes, acquisitions of Prince Philipp's, light studies in
the new style, representing white goats in the sun, poultry in
the sun, sun-bathed meadows and peasants with blinking, sun-sprinkled
faces.</p>

<p>The spindle-legged secretaire in the white-curtained window
was covered with a hundred carefully arranged articles, knick-knacks,
writing materials, and several dainty note-blocks&mdash;for
the Princess was accustomed to make careful and comprehensive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
notes about all her duties and plans. In front
of the inkstand a housekeeper's book, in which Ditlinde had
apparently just been working, lay open, and by the table there
hung on the wall a little silk-trimmed block-calendar, under
the printed date of which could be seen the pencil note: &ldquo;5
o'clock: my brothers.&rdquo; Between the sofa and a semicircle of
chairs over against the white swing doors into the reception
room stood an oval table with a damask cloth and blue-silk
border; the flowered tea-service, a jam-pot, long dishes of sweet
cakes, and tiny pieces of bread and butter were arranged in
ordered disorder on it, and to one side steamed the silver
tea-kettle over its spirit-flame on a glass table. But there were
flowers everywhere&mdash;flowers in the vases on the writing-table,
on the tea-table, on the glass table, on the china-cabinet, on
the table next the white sofa, and a flower-table full of flower-pots
stood in the window.</p>

<p>This room, situated at the side and in a corner of the suite
of reception rooms, was Ditlinde's cabinet, her boudoir, the
room in which she used to entertain quite intimate friends and
to make tea with her own hands. Klaus Heinrich watched her
as she washed out the tea-pot with hot water and put the tea
in with a silver spoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Albrecht &hellip; is he coming?&rdquo; he asked with an involuntarily
restrained voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; she said, bending attentively over the crystal
tea-caddy, as if to avoid spilling any tea (and he too avoided
looking at her). &ldquo;I have of course asked him, Klaus Heinrich,
but you know he cannot bind himself. It depends on
his health whether he comes. I'm making our tea at once,
for Albrecht will drink his milk&hellip;. Possibly too Jettchen
may look in for a bit to-day. You will enjoy seeing her again.
She's so lively, and has always got such a lot to tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jettchen&rdquo; meant Fräulein von Isenschnibbe, the Princess's
friend and confidant. They had been on Christian-name terms
since they were children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In armour, too, as usual?&rdquo; said Ditlinde, placing the filled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
tea-pot on its stand and examining her brother. &ldquo;In uniform
as usual, Klaus Heinrich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood with heels together and rubbed his left hand,
which was cold, on his chest with his right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ditlinde, I like it, I'd rather. It fits so tight, you see,
and it braces me up. Besides, it is cheaper, for a proper
civil wardrobe runs into a terrible lot of money, I believe,
and Schulenburg is always going on about how dear things
are, without that. So I manage with two or three coats, and yet
can show myself in my rich relations' houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich relations!&rdquo; laughed Ditlinde. &ldquo;Still some way off
that, Klaus Heinrich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat down at the tea-table, Ditlinde on a sofa, Klaus
Heinrich on a chair opposite the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich relations!&rdquo; she repeated, and the subject obviously
excited her. &ldquo;No, far from it; how can we expect to be rich,
where cash is so short and everything is sunk in various
enterprises, Klaus Heinrich? And they are young and in the
making, they're all in the development stage, as dear Philipp
says, and won't bear full fruit till others have succeeded us.
But things are improving, that much is true, and I keep the
household straight&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ditlinde, you do keep it straight and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it straight, and write everything down and look after
the servants, and after all the payments which one's duty to
the world demands have been made, there is a nice little sum
to put by every year for the children. And dear Philipp&hellip;.
He sends his greetings, Klaus Heinrich&mdash;I forgot, he's very
sorry not to be able to be here to-day&hellip;. We've only just got
back from Hohenried, and there he is already under way, at
his office, on his properties&mdash;he's small and delicate naturally,
but when his peat or his saw-mills are in question he gets red
cheeks, and he says himself that he has been much better
since he has had so much to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he say so?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich, and a sad look
came into his eyes, as he looked straight beyond the flower-table
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
at the bright window&hellip;. &ldquo;Yes, I can quite believe
that it must be very stimulating to be so really splendidly
busy. In my park too the meadows have been mowed a second
time this year already, and I love seeing the hay built up in
steep heaps with a stick through the middle of each, looking
for all the world like a camp of little Indians' huts, and then
Schulenburg intends to sell it. But of course that cannot be
compared&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you!&rdquo; said Ditlinde, and drew her chin in. &ldquo;With
you it's quite different, Klaus Heinrich! The next to the
throne! You are called to other things, I imagine. My goodness,
yes! You enjoy your popularity with the people&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were silent for a while. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Ditlinde, if I'm not mistaken you're as happy
as, even happier than, before. I don't say that you have
got red cheeks, like Philipp from his peat; you always were
a bit transparent, and you are still. But you look flourishing.
I haven't yet asked, since you married, but I think there's nothing
to worry about in connexion with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat in an easy position, with her arm lightly folded
across her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm all right, Klaus Heinrich, your eyes
don't deceive you, and it would be ungrateful of me not to
acknowledge my good fortune. You see, I know quite well
that many people in the country are disappointed by my
marriage and say that I have ruined myself, and demeaned
myself, and so on. And such people are not far to seek, for
brother Albrecht, as you know as well as I do, in his heart
despises my dear Philipp and me into the bargain, and can't
abide him, and calls him privately a tradesman and shopkeeper.
But that doesn't bother me, for I meant it when I
accepted Philipp's hand&mdash;seized it, I would say, if it didn't
sound so wild&mdash;accepted it because it was warm and honest,
and offered to take me away from the Old Schloss. For when
I look back and think of the Old Schloss and life in it as I
should have gone on living if it had not been for dear Philipp,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
I shudder, Klaus Heinrich, and I feel that I could not have
borne it and should have become strange and queer like poor
mamma. I am a bit delicate naturally, as you know, I should
have simply gone under in so much desolation and sadness,
and when dear Philipp came, I thought: now's your chance.
And when people say that I am a bad Princess, because I have
in a way abdicated, and fled here where it is rather warmer
and more friendly, and when they say that I lack dignity or
consciousness of Highness, or whatever they call it, they are
stupid and ignorant, Klaus Heinrich, because I have too much,
I have on the contrary too much of it, that's a fact, otherwise
the Old Schloss would not have had such an effect upon me,
and Albrecht ought to see that, for he too, in his way, has too
much of it&mdash;all we Grimmburgers have too much of it, and
that's why it sometimes looks as if we had too little of it.
And sometimes, when Philipp is under way, as he is now, and
I sit here among my flowers and Philipp's pictures with all
their sun&mdash;it's lucky that it's painted sun, for bless me! otherwise
we should have to get sun-blinds&mdash;and everything is tidy
and clean, and I think of the blessing, as you call it, in store
for me, then I seem to myself like the little mermaid in the
fairy-tale which the Swiss governess read to us, if you remember&mdash;who
married a mortal and got legs instead of her fish's
tail&hellip;. I don't know if you understand me&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Ditlinde, of course, I understand you perfectly.
And I am really glad that everything has turned out so well
and happily for you. For it is dangerous, I may tell you,
in my experience it is difficult for us to be suitably happy.
It's so easy to go wrong and be misunderstood, for the nuisance
is that nobody protects our dignity for us if we don't
do it ourselves, and then blame and scandal so readily follow&hellip;.
But which is the right way? You have found it.
They have quite recently announced my engagement with
Cousin Griseldis in the newspapers. That was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ballon
d'essai</i>, as they call it, and they think it was a very happy
one. But Griseldis is a silly girl, and half-dead with anæmia,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
and never says anything but &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; so far as I know. I've
never given her a thought, nor has Knobelsdorff, thank goodness.
The news was at once announced to be unfounded&hellip;.
Here comes Albrecht!&rdquo; he said, and stood up.</p>

<p>A cough was heard outside. A footman in olive-green
livery threw open the swing doors with a quick, firm, and
noiseless movement of both arms, and announced in a subdued
voice: &ldquo;His Royal Highness the Grand Duke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he stepped aside with a bow. Albrecht advanced
through the room.</p>

<p>He had traversed the hundred yards from the Old Schloss
hither in a closed carriage, with his huntsman on the box.
He was in mufti, as almost always, wore a buttoned-up frock-coat
with little satin lapels, and patent-leather boots on his
small feet. Since his accession he had grown an imperial.
His short fair hair was brushed back on each of his narrow,
sunk temples. His gait was an awkward and yet indescribably
distinguished strut, which gave his shoulder-blades a
peculiar twist. He carried his head well back and stuck his
short round underlip out, sucking gently with it against the
upper one.</p>

<p>The Princess went to the threshold to meet him. He disliked
hand-kissing, so he simply held out his hand with a soft
almost whispered greeting&mdash;his thin, cold hand which looked
so sensitive and which he stretched out from his chest while
keeping his forearm close to his body. Then he greeted his
brother Klaus Heinrich in the same way, who had waited for
him standing with heels close together in front of his chair&mdash;and
said nothing further.</p>

<p>Ditlinde talked. &ldquo;It's very nice of you to come, Albrecht.
So you're feeling well? You look splendid. Philipp wishes
me to tell you how sorry he is to have to be out this afternoon.
Sit down, won't you, anywhere you like&mdash;here, for instance,
opposite me. That chair's a pretty comfortable one, you sat
in it last time. I've made tea for us in the meantime. You'll
have your milk directly&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I must beg pardon &hellip; I'm
late. You know, the shorter the road &hellip; And then I have
to lie down in the afternoon&hellip;. There's no one else coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one else, Albrecht. At the most, Jettchen Isenschnibbe
may look in for a bit, if you don't object&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can just as well say &lsquo;Not at home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, pray don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hot milk was brought. Albrecht clasped the tall, thick,
studded glass in both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, something warm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How cold it is already
in these parts! And I've been frozen the whole summer in
Hollerbrunn. Haven't you started fires yet? I have. But
then again the smell of the stoves upsets me. All stoves
smell. Von Bühl promises me central heating for the Old
Schloss every autumn. But it seems not to be feasible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Albrecht,&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;at this time of year you
used to be already in the South, so long as father was alive.
You must long for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sympathy does you credit, dear Ditlinde,&rdquo; answered
he, still in a low and slightly lisping voice. &ldquo;But we must
show that I am on the spot. I must rule the country, as you
know, that's what I'm here for. To-day I have been graciously
pleased to allow some worthy citizen&mdash;I'm sorry I can't remember
his name&mdash;to accept and wear a foreign order.
Further, I have had a telegram sent to the annual meeting
of the Horticultural Society, in which I assumed the honorary
Presidency of the Society and pledged my word to further its
efforts in every way&mdash;without really knowing what furthering
I could do beyond sending the telegram, for the members are
quite well able to take care of themselves. Further, I have
deigned to confirm the choice of a certain worthy fellow to
be mayor of my fair city of Siebenberge&mdash;in connection with
which I should like to know whether this my subject will be a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
better mayor for my confirmation than he would have been
without it&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Albrecht, those are trifles!&rdquo; said Ditlinde.
&ldquo;I'm convinced that you've had more serious business to
do&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I've had a talk with my Minister of
Finance and Agriculture. It was time I did. Doctor Krippenreuther
would have been bitterly disappointed with me if I
had not summoned him once more. He went ahead in summary
fashion and laid before me a conspectus of several
mutually related topics at once&mdash;the harvest, the new principles
for the drawing up of the budget, the reform of taxation, on
which he is busy. The harvest has been a bad one, it seems.
The peasants have been hit by blight and bad weather; not
only they, but Krippenreuther too, are much concerned about
it, because the tax-paying resources of the land, he says, have
once more suffered contraction. Besides, there have unfortunately
been disasters in more than one of the silver-mines.
The gear is at a standstill, says Krippenreuther, it is damaged
and will cost a lot of money to repair. I listened to the whole
recital with an appropriate expression on my face, and did
what I could to express my grief for such a series of misfortunes.
Next, I was consulted as to whether the cost of
the necessary new buildings for the Treasury and for the
Woods and Customs and Inland Revenue Offices ought to be
debited to the ordinary or the extraordinary estimates; I
learnt a lot about sliding scales, and income tax, and tax
on tourist traffic, and the removal of burdens from oppressed
agriculture and the imposition of burdens on the towns; and
on the whole I got the impression that Krippenreuther was
well up in his subject. I, of course, know practically nothing
about it&mdash;which Krippenreuther knows and approves; so I
just said &lsquo;yes, yes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;of course,&rsquo; and &lsquo;many thanks,&rsquo; and let
him run on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak so bitterly, Albrecht.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>&ldquo;No; I'll just tell you what struck me while Krippenreuther
was holding forth to me to-day. There's a man living in this
town, a man with small private means and a warty nose.
Every child knows him and shouts &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; when he sees him; he
is called &lsquo;the Hatter,&rsquo; for he is not quite all there; his surname
he has lost long ago. He is always on the spot when there
is anything going on, although his half-wittedness keeps him
from playing any serious part in anything; he wears a rose
in his buttonhole, and carries his hat about on the end of his
walking-stick. Twice a day, about the time when a train
starts, he goes to the station, taps the wheels, examines the
luggage, and fusses about. Then when the guard blows his
whistle, &lsquo;the Hatter&rsquo; waves to the engine-driver, and the train
starts. But &lsquo;the Hatter&rsquo; deludes himself into thinking that
his waving sends the train off. That's like me. I wave, and
the train starts. But it would start without me, and my waving
makes no difference, it's mere silly show. I'm sick of
it&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brother and sister were silent. Ditlinde looked at her
lap in an embarrassed way, and Klaus Heinrich gazed, as
he tugged at his little bow-shaped moustache, between her
and the Grand Duke at the bright window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can quite follow you, Albrecht,&rdquo; said he after a while,
&ldquo;though it is rather cruel of you to compare yourself and us
with &lsquo;the Hatter.&rsquo; You see, I too understand nothing about
sliding scales and taxation of tourist traffic and peat-cutting,
and there is such a lot about which I know nothing&mdash;everything
which is covered by the expression &lsquo;the misery in the
world&rsquo;&mdash;hunger and want, and the struggle for existence, as
it is called, and war and hospital horrors, and all that. I
have seen and studied not one of these, except death itself,
when father died, and that too was not death as it can be, but
rather it was edifying, and the whole Schloss was illuminated.
And at times I feel ashamed of myself because I have not
knocked about the world. But then I tell myself that mine
is not a comfortable life, not at all comfortable, although I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>
&lsquo;wander on the heights of mankind,&rsquo; as people express it, or
perhaps just because I do, and that I perhaps in my own way
know more about the strenuousness of life, its &lsquo;tight-lipped
countenance,&rsquo; if you will allow me the expression, than many
a one who knows all about the sliding scales or any other
single department of life. And the upshot of that is, Albrecht,
that my life is not a comfortable one&mdash;that's the upshot of
everything&mdash;if you will allow me this retort, and that is how
we justify ourselves. And if people cry &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; when they see
me, they must know why they do so, and my life must have
some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</i>, although I am prevented from playing any
serious part in anything, as you so admirably express it.
And you're quite justified too. You wave to order, because
the people wish you to wave, and if you do not really control
their wishes and aspirations, yet you express them and
give them substance, and may be that's no slight matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Albrecht sat upright at the table. He held his thin,
strangely sensitive-looking hands crossed on the table-edge
in front of the tall, half-empty glass of milk, and his eyelids
dropped, and he sucked his underlip against his upper. He
answered quietly: &ldquo;I'm not surprised that so popular a
prince as you should be contented with his lot. I for my
part decline to express somebody else in my own person&mdash;I
decline to, say, and you may think it's a case of sour grapes as
much as you like. The truth is that I care for the &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; of
the people just as little as any living soul possibly could care.
I say soul, not body. The flesh is weak&mdash;there's something
in one which expands at applause and contracts at cold
silence. But my reason rises superior to all considerations of
popularity or unpopularity. If I <em>did</em> succeed in being a true
national representative, I know what that would amount to.
A misconception of my personality. Besides, a few hand-claps
from people one does not know are not worth a shrug
of the shoulders. Others&mdash;you&mdash;may be inspired by the feeling
of the people behind you. You must forgive me for
being too matter-of-fact to feel any such mysterious feeling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
of happiness&mdash;and too keen on cleanliness also, if you will
allow me to put it thus. That kind of happiness stinks, to
my thinking. Anyhow, I'm a stranger to the people. I give
them nothing&mdash;what can they give me? With you &hellip; oh,
that's quite different. Hundreds of thousands, who are like
you, are grateful to you because they can recognize themselves
in you. You may laugh if you like. The chief danger you
run is that you submerge yourself in your popularity too
readily; and yet after all you feel no apprehensions, although
you are aware at this very moment&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Albrecht, I don't think so. I don't think I run any
such danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we shall understand each other all the better. I have
no penchant for strong expressions as a rule. But popularity
is hog-wash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's funny, Albrecht. Funny that you should use that word.
The &lsquo;Pheasants&rsquo; were always using it&mdash;my schoolmates, the
young sprigs, you know, at the &lsquo;Pheasantry.&rsquo; I know what you
are. You're an aristocrat, that's what's the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? You're wrong. I'm no aristocrat, I'm
the opposite, by taste and reason. You must allow that I
do not despise the &lsquo;Hi's&rsquo; of the crowd from arrogance, but
from a propensity to humanity and goodness. Human Highness
is a pitiable thing, and I'm convinced that mankind ought
to see that everyone behaves like a man, and a good man, to
his neighbour and does not humiliate him or cause him shame.
A man must have a thick skin to be able to carry off all the
flummery of Highness without any feeling of shame. I am
naturally rather sensitive, I cannot cope with the absurdity of
my situation. Every lackey who plants himself at the door,
and expects me to pass him without noticing, without heeding
him more than the door posts, fills me with embarrassment,
that's the way I feel towards the people&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Albrecht, quite true. It's often by no means easy to
keep one's countenance when one passes by a fellow like that.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
The lackeys! If one only did not know what frauds they
are! One hears fine stories about them&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What stories?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, one keeps one's ears open&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Ditlinde. &ldquo;Don't let's worry about
that. Here you are talking about ordinary things, and I had
two topics noted down which I thought we might discuss this
afternoon&hellip;. Would you be so kind, Klaus Heinrich, as
to reach me that notebook there in blue leather on the writing-table?
Many thanks. I note down in this everything I have
to remember, both household matters and other things.
What a blessing it is to be able to see everything down in
black and white! My head is terribly weak, it can't remember
things, and if I weren't tidy and didn't jot everything down,
I should be done for. First of all, Albrecht, before I forget
it, I wanted to remind you that you must escort Aunt Catherine
at the first Court on November 1st&mdash;you can't get out of it.
I withdraw; the honour fell to me at the last Court Ball,
and Aunt Catherine was terribly put out&hellip;. Do you consent?
Good, then I cross out item 1. Secondly, Klaus Heinrich,
I wanted to ask you to make a short appearance at the
Orphan Children's Bazaar on the 15th in the Town Hall. I
am patroness, and I take my duties seriously, as you see.
You needn't buy anything&mdash;a pocket comb&hellip;. In short,
all you need do is to show yourself for ten minutes. It's for
the orphans&hellip;. Will you come? You see, now I can
cross another off. Thirdly&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Princess was interrupted. Fräulein von Isenschnibbe,
the Court lady, was announced and tripped in at
once through the big drawing-room, her feather boa waving
in the draught, and the brim of her huge feather hat flapping
up and down. The smell of the fresh air from outside seemed
to cling to her clothes. She was small, very fair, with a
pointed nose, and so short-sighted that she could not see the
stars. On clear evenings she would stand on her balcony
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
and gaze at the starry heavens through opera-glasses, and
rave about them. She wore two strong pairs of glasses, one
behind the other, and screwed up her eyes and stuck her head
forward as she curtseyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, Grand Ducal Highness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn't
know; I'm disturbing you, I'm intruding. I most humbly beg
pardon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers had risen, and the visitor, as she curtseyed
to them, was filled with confusion. As Albrecht extended
his hand from his chest, keeping his forearm close to his
body, her arm was stretched out almost perpendicularly, when
the curtsey which she made him had reached its lowest point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Jettchen,&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;what nonsense! You are
expected and welcome, and my brothers know that we call
each other by our Christian names, so none of that Grand
Ducal Highness, if you please. We are not in the Old Schloss.
Sit down and make yourself comfortable. Will you have
some tea? It's still hot, and here are some candied fruits, I
know you like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a thousand thanks, Ditlinde, I adore them!&rdquo; And
Fräulein von Isenschnibbe took a chair on the narrow side
of the tea-table opposite Klaus Heinrich, with her back to
the window, drew a glove off and began peering forward, to
lay sweetmeats on her plate with the silver tongs. Her little
bosom heaved quickly and nervously with pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got some news,&rdquo; she said, unable any longer to contain
herself. &ldquo;News&hellip;. More than any reticule will hold!
That is to say it is really only one piece of news, only one&mdash;but
it's so weighty that it counts for dozens, and it is quite
certain, I have it on the best authority&mdash;you know that I am
reliable, Ditlinde; this very evening it will be in the <i>Courier</i>
and to-morrow the whole town will be talking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jettchen,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;it must be confessed
you never come with empty hands; but now we're excited,
do tell us your news.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>&ldquo;Very well. Let me get my breath. Do you know, Ditlinde,
does your Royal Highness know, does your Grand
Ducal Highness know who's coming, who is coming to the
spa, who is coming for six or eight weeks to the Spa Hotel
to drink the waters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;but do you know, dear Jettchen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoelmann,&rdquo; said Fräulein von Isenschnibbe. &ldquo;Spoelmann,&rdquo;
she said, leaned back and made as if to draw with
her fingers on the table-edge, but checked the movement of
her hand just over the blue silk border.</p>

<p>The brothers and sister looked doubtfully at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoelmann?&rdquo; asked Ditlinde&hellip;. &ldquo;Think a moment,
Jettchen, the real Spoelmann?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real one!&rdquo; Her voice cracked with suppressed jubilation.
&ldquo;The real one, Ditlinde! For there's only one, or
rather only one whom everybody knows, and he it is whom
they are expecting at the Spa Hotel&mdash;the great Spoelmann,
the giant Spoelmann, the colossus Samuel N. Spoelmann from
America!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, child, what's bringing him here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, forgive me for saying so, Ditlinde, but what a
question! His yacht or some big steamer is bringing him
over the sea of course, he's on his holidays making a tour of
Europe and has expressed his intention of drinking the Spa
waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is he ill, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Ditlinde; all people of his kind are ill, that's
part of the business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Grand Ducal Highness, it is remarkable. His kind
of existence must bring that with it. For there's no doubt
it's a trying existence, and not at all a comfortable one, and
must wear the body out quicker than an ordinary man's life
would. Most suffer in the stomach, but Spoelmann suffers
from stone as everybody knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stone, does he?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>&ldquo;Of course, Ditlinde, you must have heard it and forgotten
it. He has stone in the kidneys, if you will forgive me the
horrid expression&mdash;a serious, trying illness, and I'm sure he
can't get the slightest pleasure from his frantic wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how in the world has he pitched upon our waters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ditlinde, that's simple. The waters are good, they're
excellent; especially the Ditlinde spring, with its lithium or
whatever they call it, is admirable against gout and stone, and
only waiting to be properly known and valued throughout
the world. But a man like Spoelmann, you can imagine, a
man like that is above names and trade-puffs, and follows his
own kind. And so he has discovered our waters&mdash;or his
physician has recommended them to him, it may be that, and
bought it in the bottle, and it has done him good, and now
he may think that it must do him still more good if he drinks
it on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all kept silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, Albrecht,&rdquo; said Ditlinde at last, &ldquo;whatever
one thinks of Spoelmann and his kind&mdash;and I'm not going to
commit myself to an opinion, of that you may be sure&mdash;but
don't you think that the man's visit to the Spa may be
very useful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke turned his head with his stiff and refined
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Fräulein von Isenschnibbe,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She has
doubtless already considered the question from that point of
view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your Royal Highness asks me &hellip; enormously useful!
Immeasurably, incalculably useful&mdash;that's obvious! The
directors are in the seventh heaven, they're getting ready to
decorate and illuminate the Spa Hotel! What a recommendation,
what an attraction for strangers! Will your
Royal Highness just consider&mdash;the man is a curiosity! Your
Grand Ducal Highness spoke just now of &lsquo;his kind&rsquo;&mdash;but there
are none of &lsquo;his kind&rsquo;&mdash;at most, only a couple. He's a Leviathan,
a Cr&oelig;sus! People will come from miles away to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
see a being who has about half a million a day to spend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Ditlinde, taken aback. &ldquo;And there's dear
Philipp worrying about his peat beds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first scene,&rdquo; the Fräulein went on, &ldquo;begins with two
Americans hanging about the Exchange for the last couple
of days. Who are they? They are said to be journalists,
reporters, for two big New York papers. They have preceded
the Leviathan, and are telegraphing to their papers
preliminary descriptions of the scenery. When he has got
here they will telegraph every step he takes&mdash;just as the
<i>Courier</i> and the <i>Advertiser</i> report about your Royal Highness&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Albrecht bowed his thanks with eyes downcast and underlip
<ins title="protuded">protruded</ins>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has appropriated the Prince's suite in the Spa Hotel,&rdquo;
said Jettchen, <ins title="as">&ldquo;as</ins> provisional lodgings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For himself alone?&rdquo; asked Ditlinde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Ditlinde, do you suppose he'd be coming alone?
There isn't any precise information about his suite and staff,
but it's quite certain that his daughter and his physician-in-ordinary
are coming with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It annoys me, Jettchen, to hear you talking about a
&lsquo;physician-in-ordinary&rsquo; and the journalists, too, and the Prince's
suite to boot. He's not a king, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A railway king, so far as I know,&rdquo; remarked Albrecht
quietly with eyes downcast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only, nor even particularly, a railway king, Royal
Highness, according to what I hear. Over in America they
have those great business concerns called Trusts, as your
Royal Highness knows&mdash;the Steel Trust for instance, the Sugar
Trust, the Petroleum Trust, the Coal, Meat, and Tobacco
Trusts, and goodness knows how many more, and Samuel N.
Spoelmann has a finger in nearly all these trusts, and is chief
shareholder in them, and managing director&mdash;that's what I
believe they call them&mdash;so his business must be what is called
over here a &lsquo;Mixed Goods Business.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>&ldquo;A nice sort of business,&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;it must be a
nice sort of business! For you can't persuade me, dear Jettchen,
that honest work can make a man into a Leviathan and
a Cr&oelig;sus. I am convinced that his riches are steeped in the
blood of widows and orphans. What do you think, Albrecht?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Ditlinde, I hope so, for your own and your
husband's comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; explained Jettchen, &ldquo;yet Spoelmann&mdash;our
Samuel N. Spoelmann&mdash;is hardly responsible for it, for he
is really nothing but an heir, and may quite well not have
had any particular taste for his business. It was his father
who really made the pile, I've read all about it, and may say
that I really know the general facts. His father was a German&mdash;simply
an adventurer who crossed the seas and became
gold-digger. And he was lucky and made a little money
through gold-finds&mdash;or rather quite a decent amount of money&mdash;and
began to speculate in petroleum and steel and railways,
and then in every sort of thing, and kept growing richer and
richer, and when he died everything was already in full swing,
and his son Samuel, who inherited the Cr&oelig;sus' firm, really had
nothing to do but to collect the princely dividends and keep
growing richer and richer till he beat all records. That's the
way things have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has a daughter, has he, Jettchen? What's she
like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ditlinde, his wife is dead, but he has a daughter,
Miss Spoelmann, and he's bringing her with him. She's a
wonderful girl from all I've read about her. He himself is
a bit of a mixture, for his father married a wife from the
South&mdash;Creole blood, the daughter of a German father and
native mother. But Samuel in his turn married a German-American
of half-English blood, and their daughter is now
Miss Spoelmann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Jettchen, she's a creature of many colours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say so, Ditlinde, and she's clever, so I've
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
heard; she studies like a man&mdash;algebra, and puzzling things
of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm, that too doesn't attract me much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now comes the cream of the business, Ditlinde, for
Miss Spoelmann has a lady-companion, and that lady-companion
is a countess, a real genuine countess, who dances
attendance on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Ditlinde, &ldquo;she ought to be ashamed of
herself. No, Jettchen, my mind is made up. I'm not going
to bother myself about Spoelmann. I'm going to let him
drink his waters and go, with his countess and his algebraical
daughter, and am not going so much as to turn my head to
look at him. He and his riches make no impression on me.
What do you think, Klaus Heinrich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked past Jettchen's head at the bright
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impression?&rdquo; he said&hellip;. &ldquo;No, riches make no impression
on me, I think&mdash;I mean, riches in the ordinary way.
But it seems to me that it depends &hellip; it depends, I think,
on the standard. We too have one or two rich people in the
town here&mdash;Soap-boiler Unschlitt must be a millionaire&hellip;. I
often see him in his carriage. He's dreadfully fat and common.
But when a man is quite ill and lonely from mere
riches &hellip; Maybe&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An uncomfortable sort of man anyhow,&rdquo; said Ditlinde,
and the subject of the Spoelmanns gradually dropped.
The conversation turned on family matters, the &ldquo;Hohenried&rdquo;
property, and the approaching season. Shortly before
seven o'clock the Grand Duke sent for his carriage.
Prince Klaus Heinrich was going too, so they all got up
and said good-bye. But while the brothers were being
helped into their coats in the hall, Albrecht said: &ldquo;I should
be obliged, Klaus Heinrich, if you would send your coachman
home and would give me the pleasure of your company
for a quarter of an hour longer. I've got a matter of some
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
importance to discuss with you&mdash;I might come with you to
the Hermitage, but I can't bear the evening air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich clapped his heels together as he answered:
&ldquo;No, Albrecht, you mustn't think of it! I'll drive to the
Schloss with you if you like. I am of course at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the prelude to a remarkable conversation between
the young princes, the upshot of which was published a few
days later in the <i>Advertiser</i> and received with general approval.</p>

<p>The Prince accompanied the Grand Duke to the Schloss,
through the Albrechtstor, up broad stone steps, through corridors
where naked gas lamps were burning, and silent ante-rooms,
between lackeys into Albrecht's &ldquo;closet,&rdquo; where old
Prahl had lighted the two bronze oil-lamps on the mantelpiece.
Albrecht had taken over his father's work-room&mdash;it
had always been the work-room of the reigning sovereigns,
and lay on the first floor between an aide-de-camp's room
and the dining-room in daily use facing the Albrechtsplatz,
which the princes had always overlooked and watched from
their writing-table. It was an exceptionally unhomely and
repellent room, small, with cracked ceiling-paintings, red silk
and gold-bordered carpet, and three windows reaching to the
ground, through which the draught blew keenly and before
which the claret-coloured curtains with their elaborate fringes
were drawn. It had a false chimney-piece in French Empire
taste, in front of which a semicircle of little modern quilted
plush chairs without arms were arranged, and a hideously
decorated white stove, which gave out a great heat. Two big
quilted sofas stood opposite each other by the walls, and in
front of one stood a square book-table with a red plush cover.
Between the windows two narrow gold-framed mirrors with
marble ledges reached up to the ceiling, the right hand one
of which bore a fairly cheerful alabaster group, the other a
water bottle and medicine glasses. The writing-desk, an old
piece made of rose-wood with a roll-top and metal clasps, stood
clear in the middle of the room on the red carpet. An
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
antique stared down with its dead eyes from a pedestal in one
corner of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I have to suggest to you,&rdquo; said Albrecht&mdash;he was
standing at the writing-table, unconsciously toying with a
paper-knife, a silly thing like a cavalry-sabre with a grotesque
handle, &ldquo;is directly connected with our conversation this afternoon.
I may begin by saying that I discussed the matter
thoroughly with Knobelsdorff this summer at Hollerbrunn.
He agrees, and if you do too, as I don't doubt you will, I
can carry out my intention at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let's hear it, Albrecht,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, who
was standing at attention in a military attitude by the sofa
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My health,&rdquo; continued the Grand Duke, &ldquo;has been getting
worse and worse lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry, Albrecht&mdash;Hollerbrunn didn't agree with
you, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no, I'm in a bad way, and my health is showing
itself increasingly unequal to the demands made upon it.
When I say &lsquo;demands,&rsquo; I mean chiefly the duties of a ceremonial
and representative nature which are inseparable from my
position&mdash;and that's the bond of connexion with the conversation
we had just now at Ditlinde's. The performance
of these duties may be a happiness when a contact with the
people, a relationship, a beating of hearts in unison exists.
To me it is a torture, and the falseness of my rôle wearies me
to such a degree that I must consider what measures I can
take to counteract it. In this&mdash;so far as the bodily part of me
is concerned&mdash;I am at one with my doctors, who entirely agree
with my proposal&mdash;so listen to me. I'm unmarried. I have
no idea, I can assure you, of ever marrying; I shall have no
children. You are heir to the throne by right of birth, you
are still more so in the consciousness of the people, who love
you&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are, Albrecht, always talking about my being
beloved. I simply don't believe it. At a distance, perhaps&mdash;that's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
the way with us. It's always at a distance that we are
beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're too modest. Wait a bit. You've already been
kind enough to relieve me of some of my representative duties
now and then. I should like you to relieve me of all of them
absolutely, for always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're not thinking of abdicating, Albrecht?&rdquo; asked
Klaus Heinrich, aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daren't think of it. Believe me, I gladly would, but I
shouldn't be allowed to. What I'm thinking of is not a
regency, but only a substitution&mdash;perhaps you have some
recollection of the distinction in public law from your student's
days&mdash;a permanent and officially established substitution in
all representative functions, warranted by the need of indulgence
required by my state of health. What is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm at your orders, Albrecht. But I'm not quite clear yet.
How far does the substitution extend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, as far as possible. I should like it to extend to all
occasions on which a personal appearance in public is expected
of me. Knobelsdorff stipulates that I should only devolve
the opening and closure of Parliament on you when I'm
bedridden, only now and again. Let's grant that. But otherwise
you would be my substitute on all ceremonial occasions,
on journeys, visits to cities, opening of public festivities,
opening of the Citizens' Ball&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? We have also the weekly free audiences here&mdash;a
sensible custom without a doubt, but it tires me out.
You would hold the audiences in my place. I needn't go
on. Do you accept my proposal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am at your orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then listen to me while I finish. For every occasion on
which you act as my representative, I lend you my aides-de-camp.
It is further necessary that your military promotion
should be hastened&mdash;are you first lieutenant? You'll be made
a captain or a major straight away <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la suite</i> of your regiment&mdash;I'll
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>
see to that; but in the third place, I wish duly to emphasize
our arrangement, to make your position at my side
properly clear, by lending you the title of &lsquo;Royal Highness.&rsquo;
There were some formalities to attend to. Knobelsdorff has
already seen to them. I'm going to express my intentions in
the form of two missives to you and to my Minister of State.
Knobelsdorff has already drafted them. Do you accept?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to say, Albrecht? You are father's eldest son,
and I've always looked up to you because I've always felt
and known that you are the superior and higher of us two and
that I am only a plebeian compared with you. But if you
think me worthy to stand at your side and to bear your title
and to represent you before the people, although I don't
think myself anything like so presentable, and have this deformity
here, with my left hand, which I've always got to keep
covered&mdash;then I thank you and put myself at your orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll ask you to leave me now, please; I want to
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They advanced towards each other, the one from the writing-table,
the other from the book-table, over the carpet into the
middle of the room. The Grand Duke extended his hand to
his brother&mdash;his thin, cold hand which he stretched out from
his chest without moving his forearm away from his body.
Klaus Heinrich clapped his heels together and bowed as he
took the hand, and Albrecht nodded his narrow head with
its fair beard as a token of dismissal, while he sucked his
short, rounded lower lip against the upper. Klaus Heinrich
went back to the Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the <i>Advertiser</i> and the <i>Courier</i> published eight days
later the two missives, which contained decisions of the highest
importance, the one addressed to &ldquo;My dear Minister of State,
Baron von Knobelsdorff,&rdquo; and the other beginning with &ldquo;Most
Serene Highness and well-beloved brother,&rdquo; and signed &ldquo;Your
Royal Highness's most devoted brother Albrecht.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>VI<br/>
<small>THE LOFTY CALLING</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Here</span> follows a description of Klaus Heinrich's mode of life
and profession and their peculiarities.</p>

<p>On a typical occasion he stepped out of his carriage, walked
with cloak thrown back down a short passage through cheering
crowds over a pavement which was covered with red carpet,
through a laurel-decked house-door, over which an awning
had been erected, up a staircase flanked by pairs of candle-bearing
footmen&hellip;. He was on his way to a festival dinner,
covered to his hips with orders, the fringed epaulettes of a
major on his narrow shoulders, and was followed by his
suite along the Gothic corridor of the town hall. Two servants
hurried in front of him and quickly opened an old
window which rattled in its lead fastenings; for down below
in the market-place stood the people, wedged together head
to head, an oblique tract of upturned faces, dimly illuminated
by smoky torchlight. They cheered and sang, and he stood
at the open window and bowed, displayed himself to the general
enthusiasm for a while and nodded his thanks.</p>

<p>There was nothing really everyday, nor was there anything
really actual, about his life; it consisted of a succession of
moments of enthusiasm. Wherever he went there was holiday,
there the people were transfigured and glorified, there
the grey work-a-day world cleared up and became poetry.
The starveling became a sleek man, the hovel a homely cottage,
dirty gutter-children changed into chaste little maidens and
boys in Sunday clothes, their hair plastered with water, a
poem on their lips, and the perspiring citizen in frock-coat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
and top-hat was moved to emotion by the consciousness of
his own worth.</p>

<p>But not only he, Klaus Heinrich, saw the world in this
light, but it saw itself too, as long as his presence lasted.
A strange unreality and speciousness prevailed in places where
he exercised his calling; a symmetrical, transitory window-dressing,
an artificial and inspiring disguising of the reality
by pasteboard and gilded wood, by garlands, lamps, draperies,
and bunting, was conjured up for one fair hour, and he himself
stood in the centre of the show on a carpet, which covered
the bare ground, between masts painted in two colours, round
which garlands twined&mdash;stood with heels together in the odour
of varnish and fir-branches, and smiled with his left hand
planted on his hip.</p>

<p>He laid the foundation stone of a new town hall. The
citizens had, after juggling with the figures, got together the
necessary sum, and a learned architect from the <ins title="captital">capital</ins> had
been entrusted with the building. But Klaus Heinrich undertook
the laying of the foundation stone. Amid the cheers of
the population he drove up to the noble pavilion which had
been built on the site, stepped lightly and collectedly out of
the open carriage on to the ground, which had been rolled
and sprinkled with yellow sand, and walked all alone towards
the official personages in frock-coats and white ties who were
waiting for him at the entrance. He asked for the architect
to be presented to him, and, in full view of the public and with
the officials standing with fixed smiles round him, he conducted
a conversation with him for five full minutes, a conversation
of weighty commonplaces about the advantages of the different
styles of architecture, after which he made a decided movement,
which he had meditated to himself beforehand during
the conversation, and allowed himself to be conducted over
the carpet and plank steps to his seat on the edge of the
middle platform.</p>

<p>There, in his chain and stars, one foot advanced, his white-gloved
hands crossed on his sword hilt, his helmet on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
ground beside him, visible to the holiday crowd on every side,
he sat and listened with calm demeanour to the Lord Mayor's
speech. Thereupon, when they came to the request, he rose,
walked, without noticeable precaution and without looking at
his feet, down the steps to where the foundation stone lay, and
with a little hammer gave three slow taps to the block of sandstone,
at the same time repeating in the deep hush, with his
rather sharp voice, a sentence which Herr von Knobelsdorff
had previously impressed upon him. School children sang in
shrill chorus, and Klaus Heinrich drove away.</p>

<p>On the anniversary of the War of Independence he marched
in front of the veterans. A grey-haired officer shouted in a
voice which seemed hoarse with the smoke of gunpowder:
&ldquo;Halt! Off hats! Eyes right!&rdquo; And they stood, with
medals and crosses on their coats, the rough beavers in their
hands, and looked up at him with blood-shot eyes like those
of a hound as he walked by with a friendly look, and paused
by one or two to ask where they had served, where they had
been under fire&hellip;. He attended the gymnastic display,
graced the sports with his presence, and had the victors presented
to him for a short conversation. The lithe athletic
youths stood awkwardly before him, just after they had done
the most astonishing feats, and Klaus Heinrich quickly strung
together a few technical remarks, which he remembered from
Herr Zotte, and which he uttered with great fluency, the while
he hid his left hand.</p>

<p>He attended the Five Houses' Fishing festival, he was
present in his red-covered seat of honour at the Grimmburg
horse-races and distributed the prizes. He accepted, too, the
honorary Presidency and Patronage of the Associated Rifle
Competition; he attended the prize-meeting of the privileged
Grand Ducal Rifle Club. He &ldquo;responded cordially to the
toast of welcome,&rdquo; in the words of the <i>Courier</i>, by holding
the silver cup for one moment to his lips, and then with heels
clapped together, raising it towards the marksmen. Thereupon
he fired several shots at the target of honour, concerning
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>
which there was nothing said in the reports as to where
they hit; next ploughed through one and the same dialogue
with three successive men, about the advantages of rifle-firing,
which in the <i>Courier</i> was described as a &ldquo;general conversation,&rdquo;
and at last took leave with a hearty &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; which
evoked indescribable enthusiasm. This formula had been
whispered to him at the last moment by Adjutant-General von
Hühnemann, who had made inquiries on the subject; for of
course it would have had a bad effect, would have shattered
the fair illusion of technical knowledge and serious enthusiasm,
if Klaus Heinrich had wished the marksmen &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; and the
Alpine Club &ldquo;Bull's-eyes every time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a general rule he needed in the exercise of his calling
a certain amount of technical knowledge, which he acquired
for each succeeding occasion, with a view to applying it at
the right moment and in suitable form. It consisted preponderatingly
of the technical terms current in the different
departments of human activity as well as of historical dates,
and before setting out on an official expedition Klaus Heinrich
used to work up the necessary information at home in
the Hermitage with the help of pamphlets and oral instructions.
When he in the name of the Grand Duke, &ldquo;my most
gracious brother,&rdquo; unveiled the statue of Johann Albrecht at
Knüppelsdorf, he delivered on the scene of festivities, directly
after a performance by the massed choirs of the &ldquo;Wreath of
Harmony,&rdquo; a speech in which everything he had noted down
about Knüppelsdorf was dragged in, and which produced
the delightful impression everywhere that he had busied himself
all his life with nothing so much as the historical vicissitudes
of that hub of civilization.</p>

<p>In the first place, Knüppelsdorf was a city, and Klaus Heinrich
alluded to that three times, to the pride of the inhabitants.
He went on to say that the city of Knüppelsdorf, as her historical
past witnessed, had been connected by bonds of loyalty
to the House of Grimmburg for several centuries. As long
ago as the fourteenth century, he said, Langrave Heinrich&nbsp;XV,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
the Rutensteiner, had signalled out Knüppelsdorf for special
favour. He, the Rutensteiner, had lived in the Schloss built
on the neighbouring Rutensteine, whose girdle of proud towers
and strong walls had sent its greeting to the country for miles
round.</p>

<p>Then he reminded his hearers how through inheritance
and marriage Knüppelsdorf had at last come into the branch
of the family to which his brother and he himself belonged.
Heavy storms had in the course of years burst over Knüppelsdorf.
Years of war, conflagration, and pestilence had visited
it, yet it had always risen again and had always remained
loyal to the house of its hereditary princes. And this characteristic
the Knüppelsdorf of to-day proved that it possessed
by raising a memorial to his, Klaus Heinrich's, beloved father,
and it would be with unusual pleasure that he would report to
his gracious brother the dazzling and hearty reception which
he, as his representative, had here experienced&hellip;. The veil
fell, the massed choirs of the &ldquo;Wreath of Harmony&rdquo; again did
their best. And Klaus Heinrich stood smiling, under his
theatrical tent, with a feeling of having exhausted his store
of knowledge, happy in the certainty that nobody dare question
him further. For he couldn't have said one blessed word
more about Knüppelsdorf!</p>

<p>How tiring his life was, how strenuous! Sometimes he felt
as if he had constantly to keep upright, at a great strain to
his elasticity, something which it was quite impossible, or
possible only in favourable conditions, to keep upright.
Sometimes his calling seemed to him a wretched and paltry
one, although he liked it and gladly undertook every expedition
required of him in his representative capacity.</p>

<p>He travelled miles to an agricultural exhibition, travelled
in a badly hung cart from Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; to the station,
where the Premier, the Chief of Police, and the directors of
the railway company awaited him at the saloon carriage. He
travelled for an hour and a half, the while carrying on, not
without difficulty, a conversation with the Grand Ducal adjutants,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
who had been attached to him, and the Agricultural
Commissioner, Assistant Secretary Heckepfeng, a severe and
respectful man who also accompanied him. Then he reached
the station of the city which had organized the agricultural
exhibition. The Mayor, with a chain over his shoulders, was
awaiting him at the head of six or seven other official persons.
The station was decorated with a quantity of fir-branches and
festoons. In the back-ground stood the plaster busts of
Albrecht and Klaus Heinrich in a frame of greenery. The
public behind the barriers gave three cheers, and the bells
pealed.</p>

<p>The Mayor read an address of welcome to Klaus Heinrich.
He thanked him, he said, brandishing his top-hat in his hand,
he thanked him on behalf of the city for all the favour which
Klaus Heinrich's brother and he himself showed them, and
heartily wished him a long and blessed reign. He also begged
the Prince twice over graciously to crown the work which had
prospered so famously under his patronage, and to open the
agricultural exhibition.</p>

<p>This Mayor bore the title of Agricultural Councillor, a
fact of which Klaus Heinrich had been apprised, and on account
of which he addressed him thus three times in his
answer. He said that he was delighted that the work of the
agricultural exhibition had prospered so famously under his
patronage. (As a matter of fact he had forgotten that he was
patron of this exhibition.) He had come to put the finishing
touch that day to the great work, by opening the exhibition.
Then he inquired as to four things: as to the economical circumstances
of the city, the increase in the population in recent
years, as to the labour-market (although he had no very clear
idea what the labour-market was), and as to the price of
victuals. When he heard that the price of victuals was high,
he &ldquo;viewed the matter in a serious light,&rdquo; and that of course
was all he could do. Nobody expected anything more of
him, and it came as a comfort to everybody that he had viewed
the high prices in a serious light.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>Then the Mayor presented the city dignitaries to him: the
higher District Judge, a noble landed proprietor from the
neighbourhood, the rector, the two doctors, and a forwarding
agent, and Klaus Heinrich addressed a question to each, thinking
over, while the answer came, what he should say to the
next. The local veterinary surgeon and the local inspector
of stock-breeding were also present. Finally they climbed
into carriages, and drove, amid the cheers of the inhabitants,
between fences of school-children, firemen, the patriotic
societies, through the gaily decked city to the exhibition
ground&mdash;not without being stopped once more at the gate by
white-robed maidens with wreaths on their heads, one of
whom, the Mayor's daughter, handed to the prince in his
carriage a bouquet with white satin streamers, and in lasting
memory of the moment received one of those pretty and
valuable gew-gaws which Klaus Heinrich took with him on
his journeys, a breast-pin embedded, for a reason she could
not guess, in <em>velvet</em> (sammet), which figured in the <i>Courier</i>
as a jewel mounted in gold.</p>

<p>Tents, pavilions, and stands had been erected on the ground.
Gaudy pennons fluttered on long rows of poles strung together
with festoons. On a wooden platform hung with bunting,
between drapings, festoons, and parti-coloured flagstaffs,
Klaus Heinrich read the short opening speech. And then
began the tour of inspection.</p>

<p>There were cattle tethered to low crossbars, prize beasts of
the best blood with smooth round particoloured bodies and
numbered shields on their broad foreheads. There were
horses stamping and snuffing, heavy farm-horses with Roman
noses and bushes of hair round their pasterns, as well as
slender, restless saddle horses. There were naked short-legged
pigs, and a large selection of both ordinary and prize pigs.
With dangling bellies they grubbed up the ground with their
snouts, while great blocks of woolly sheep filled the air with
a confused chorus of bass and treble. There were ear-splitting
exhibits of poultry, cocks and hens of every kind,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>
from the big Brahmaputra to the copper-coloured bantam;
ducks and pigeons of all sorts, eggs and fodder, both fresh and
artificially preserved. There were exhibits of agricultural
produce, grain of all sorts, beets and clover, potatoes, peas,
and flax; vegetables, too, both fresh and dried; raw and preserved
fruit; berries, marmalade, and syrups.</p>

<p>Lastly there were exhibits of agricultural implements and
machines, displayed by several technical firms, provided with
everything of service to agriculture, from the hand-plough
to the great black-funnelled motors, looking like elephants in
their stall, from the simplest and most intelligible objects to
those which consisted of a maze of wheels, chains, rods, cylinders,
arms, and teeth&mdash;a world, an entire overpowering world
of ingenious utility.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked at everything; he walked, with his
sword-hilt on his forearm, down the rows of animals, cages,
sacks, tubs, glasses, and implements. The dignitary at his
side pointed with his white-gloved hand to this and that, venturing
on a remark from time to time, and Klaus Heinrich
acted up to his calling. He expressed in words his appreciation
of all he saw, stopped from time to time and engaged the
exhibitors of the animals in conversation, inquired in an
affable way into their circumstances, and put questions to the
country people whose answers entailed a scratching behind
their ears. And as he walked he bowed his thanks on both
sides for the homage of the population which lined his path.</p>

<p>The people had collected most thickly at the exit, where
the carriages were waiting, in order to watch him drive off.
A way was kept free for him, a straight passage to the step
of his landau, and he walked quickly down it, bowing continuously
with his hand to his helmet&mdash;alone and formally
separated from all those men who, in honouring him, were
cheering their own archetype, their standard, and of whose
lives, work, and ability he was the splendid representative,
though not participator.</p>

<p>With a light and free step he mounted the carriage, settled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>
himself artistically so that he at once assumed a perfectly graceful
and self-possessed pose, and drove, saluting as he went, to
the clubhouse, where luncheon was prepared. During luncheon&mdash;indeed,
directly after the second course&mdash;the District
Judge proposed the health of the Grand Duke and the Prince,
whereupon Klaus Heinrich at once rose to drink to the welfare
of the county, and city. After the luncheon, however, he
retired to the room which the Mayor had put at his disposal
in his official residence and lay down on the bed for an hour,
for the exercise of his calling exhausted him in a strange
degree, and that afternoon he was due not only to visit in that
city the church, the school, and various factories, especially
Behnke Brothers' cheese factory, and to express high satisfaction
with everything, but also to extend his journey and visit
a scene of disaster, a burnt-out village, in order to express
to the villagers his brother's and his own sympathy, and to
cheer the afflicted by his exalted presence.</p>

<p>When he got back to the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; to his soberly furnished
Empire room, he read the newspaper accounts of his
expeditions. Then Privy Councillor Schustermann of the
Press Bureau, which was under the Home Secretary, appeared
in the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; and brought the extracts from the papers,
cleanly pasted on white sheets, dated and labelled with the
name of the paper. And Klaus Heinrich read about the impression
he had produced, read about his personal graciousness
and Highness, read that he had acquitted himself nobly
and taken the hearts of young and old by storm&mdash;that he had
raised the minds of the people out of the ruck of everyday
and filled them with gladness and affection.</p>

<p>And then he gave free audiences in the Old Schloss, as it
had been arranged.</p>

<p>The custom of free audiences had been introduced by a
well-meaning ancestor of Albrecht&nbsp;II, and the people clung to
it. Once every week Albrecht, or Klaus in his place, was
accessible to everybody. Whether the petitioner was a man
of rank or not, whether the subject of his petitions were of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>
a public or personal nature&mdash;he had only to give in his name
to Herr von Bühl, or even the aide-de-camp on duty, and he
was given an opportunity of bringing his matter to notice in
the highest quarters.</p>

<p>Indeed an admirable custom! For it meant that the
petitioner did not have to go round by way of a written
application, with the dismal prospect of his petition disappearing
for ever into a pigeon-hole, but had the happy
assurance that his application would go straight to the most
exalted quarters. It must be admitted that the most exalted
quarters&mdash;Klaus Heinrich at this time&mdash;naturally were not in
a position to go into the matter, to scrutinize it seriously and
to come to a decision upon it, but that they handed the matter
on to the pigeon-holes, in which it &ldquo;disappeared.&rdquo; But the
custom was none the less helpful, though not in the sense of
matter-of-fact utility. The citizen, the petitioner, came to
Herr von Bühl with the request to be received, and a day and
hour were fixed for him. With glad embarrassment he saw
the day draw near, worked up in his own mind the sentences
in which he intended to explain his business, had his frock-coat
and his hat ironed, put on his best shirt, and generally
made himself ready.</p>

<p>But in reality these solemn interviews were well calculated to
turn the petitioner's thoughts away from the gross material end
in view, and to make the reception itself seem to him the
main point, the essential object of his excited anticipation.
The hour came, and the citizen took, what he never otherwise
took, a cab, in order not to dirty his clean boots. He drove
between the lions at the Albrechtstor, and the sentries as well
as the stalwart doorkeeper gave him free passage. He landed
in the courtyard at the colonnade in front of the weather-beaten
entrance, and was at once admitted by a lackey in a
brown coat and sand-coloured gaiters to an ante-room on the
ground floor to the left, in one corner of which was a stand
of colours, and where a number of other supplicants, talking
in low whispers, waited in a state of thoughtful tension for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>
their reception. The aide-de-camp, holding a list of those
with appointments, went backwards and forwards and took the
next on the list to one side, to instruct him in a low voice how
to behave.</p>

<p>In a neighbouring room, called the &ldquo;Free Audience Room,&rdquo;
Klaus Heinrich, in his tunic with silver collar and several
stars, stood at a round table with three golden legs, and
received. Major von Platow gave him some superficial information
about the identity of each petitioner, called the man
in, and came back in the pauses, to prompt the Prince in a
few words about the next comer. And the citizen walked in;
with the blood in his head and perspiring slightly he stood
before Klaus Heinrich. It had been impressed on him that
he was not to go too near his Royal Highness, but must keep
at a certain distance, that he must not speak without being
spoken to, and even then must not gabble off all he had to
say, but answer concisely, so as to leave the Prince material
for his questions; that he must at the conclusion withdraw
backwards and without showing the Prince his backside. The
result was that the citizen's whole attention was centred on
not breaking any of the rules given him, but for his part
contributing to the smooth and harmonious progress of the
interview.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich questioned him in the same way as he was
wont to question the veterans, the marksmen, the gymnasts, the
countrymen, and the victims of the fire, smiling, and with
his left hand planted well back on his hip; and the citizen
too smiled involuntarily&mdash;and was imbued with a feeling as
if that smile lifted him far above the troubles which had held
him prisoner. That common man, whose spirit otherwise
cleaved to the dust, who gave a thought to nothing, not even
to everyday politeness, beyond what was purely utilitarian, and
had come here too with a definite object in view&mdash;he felt in
his heart that there was something higher than business and his
business in particular, and he left the Schloss elevated, purified,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>
with eyes dim with emotion and the smile still on his flushed
face.</p>

<p>That was the way in which Klaus Heinrich gave free
audiences, that the way in which he exercised his exalted calling.
He lived at the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; in his little refuge, the
Empire room, which was furnished so stiffly and meagrely,
with cool indifference to comfort and intimacy. Faded silk
covered the walls above the white wainscot, glass chandeliers
hung from the ugly ceiling, straight-lined sofas, mostly without
tables, and thin-legged stands supporting marble clocks,
stood along the walls, pairs of white-lacquered chairs, with
oval backs and thin silk upholstery, flanked the white-lacquered
folding-doors, and in the corner stood white-lacquered
loo-tables, bearing vase-like candelabra. That was
how Klaus Heinrich's room looked, and its master harmonized
well with it.</p>

<p>He lived a detached and quiet life, feeling no enthusiasm
or zeal for questions on which the public differed. As
representative of his brother, he opened Parliament, but he
took no personal part in its proceedings and avoided the
yeas and nays of party divisions&mdash;with the disinterestedness
and want of convictions proper to one whose position was
above all parties. Everybody recognized that his station imposed
reserve upon him, but many were of opinion that want
of interest was rather repellently and insultingly visible in his
whole bearing. Many who came in contact with him described
him as &ldquo;cold&rdquo;; and when Doctor Ueberbein loudly
refuted this &ldquo;coldness,&rdquo; people wondered whether the one-sided
and morose man was qualified to form an opinion on the
point. Of course there were occasions when Klaus Heinrich's
glance met looks which refused to recognize him&mdash;bold, scornful,
invidious looks, which showed contempt for and ignorance
of all his actions and exertions. But even in the well-disposed,
loyal people, who showed themselves ready to esteem and
honour his life, he remarked at times after a short while a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>
certain exhaustion, indeed irritation, as if they could no longer
breathe in the atmosphere of his existence; and that worried
Klaus Heinrich, though he did not know how he could prevent
it.</p>

<p>He had no place in the everyday world; a greeting from
him, a gracious word, a winning and yet dignified wave of
the hand, were all weighty and decisive incidents. Once he
was returning in cap and greatcoat from a ride, was riding
slowly on his brown horse Florian, down the birch avenue
which skirted the waste-land and led to the park and the
&ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; and in front of him there walked a shabbily
dressed young man with a fur cap and a ridiculous tuft of hair
on his neck, sleeves and trousers that were too short for him,
and unusually large feet which he turned inwards as he walked.
He looked like the student of a technical institute or something
of that sort, for he carried a drawing-board under his arm,
on which was pinned a big drawing, a symmetrical maze of
lines in red and black ink, a projection or something of
the sort. Klaus Heinrich held his horse back behind the
young man for a good while, and examined the red and black
projection on the drawing-board. Sometimes he thought how
nice it must be to have a proper surname, to be called Doctor
Smith, and to have a serious calling.</p>

<p>He played his part at Court functions, the big and small
balls, the dinner, the concerts, and the Great Court. He joined
in autumn in the Court's shoots with his red-haired cousins
and his suite, for custom's sake and although his left arm made
shooting difficult for him. He was often seen in the evening
in the Court Theatre, in his red-ledged proscenium-box
between the two female sculptures with the crossed hands and
the stern, empty faces. For the theatre attracted him, he
loved it, loved to look at the players, to watch how they behaved,
walked off and on, and went through with their parts.
As a rule he thought them bad, rough in the means they
employed to please, and unpractised in the more subtle dissembling
of the natural and artless. For the rest, he was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>
disposed to prefer humble and popular scenes to the exalted
and ceremonious.</p>

<p>A soubrette called Mizzi Meyer was engaged at the
&ldquo;Vaudeville&rdquo; theatre in the capital, who in the newspapers
and on the lips of the public was never called anything but
&ldquo;our&rdquo; Meyer, because of her boundless popularity with high
and low. She was not beautiful, hardly pretty, her voice
was a screech, and, strictly speaking, she could lay claim to no
special gifts. And yet she had only to come on to the stage
to evoke storms of approbation, applause, and encouragement.
For this fair and compact person with her blue eyes,
her broad, high cheek-bones, her healthy, jolly, even a little uproarious
manner, was flesh of the people's flesh, and blood of
their blood. So long as she, dressed up, painted, and lighted
up from every side, faced the crowd from the boards, she was
in very deed the glorification of the people itself&mdash;indeed, the
people clapped itself when it clapped her, and in that alone
lay Mizzi Meyer's power over men's souls. Klaus Heinrich
was very fond of going with Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf
to the &ldquo;Vaudeville&rdquo; when Mizzi Meyer was playing, and
joined heartily in the applause.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One day he had a rencontre which on the one hand gave
him food for thought, on the other disillusioned him. It was
with Martini, Axel Martini, the compiler of the two books of
poetry which had been so much praised by the experts,
&ldquo;Evoë!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Holy Life.&rdquo; The meeting came about in
the following way.</p>

<p>In the capital lived a wealthy old man, a Privy Councillor,
who, since his retirement from the State Service, had devoted
his life to the advancement of the fine arts, especially poetry.
He was founder of what was known as the &ldquo;May-combat&rdquo;&mdash;a
poetical tournament which recurred every year in springtime,
to which the Privy Councillor invited poets and poetesses by
circulars and posters. Prizes were offered for the tenderest
love-song, the most fervent religious poem, the most ardent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
patriotic song, for the happiest lyrical effusions in praise of
music, the forest, the spring, the joy of life&mdash;and these prizes
consisted of sums of money, supplemented by judicious and
valuable souvenirs, such as golden pens, golden breast-pins
in the form of lyres or flowers, and more of the same kind.
The city authorities also had founded a prize, and the Grand
Duke gave a silver cup as a reward for the most absolutely
admirable of all poems sent in. The founder of the &ldquo;May-combat&rdquo;
himself, who was responsible for the first look-through
the always numerous entries, shared with two University
Professors and the editors of the literary supplements of
the <i>Courier</i> and the <i>People</i> the duties of prize-judges. The
prize-winners and the highly commended entries were printed
and published regularly in the form of an annual at the expense
of the Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>Now Axel Martini had taken part in the &ldquo;May-combat&rdquo; this
year, and had come off victorious. The poem which he had
sent in, an inspired hymn of praise to the joy of life, or
rather a highly tempestuous outbreak of the joy of life itself,
a ravishing hymn to the beauty and awfulness of life, was
conceived in the style of both his books and had given rise
to discord in the Board of Judges. The Privy Councillor himself
and the Professor of Philology had been for dismissing
it with a notice of commendation; for they considered it exaggerated
in expression, coarse in its passion, and in places
frankly repulsive. But the Professor of Literary History together
with the editors had out-voted them, not only in view
of the fact that Martini's contribution represented the best
poem to the joy of life, but also in consideration of its undeniable
pre-eminence, and in the end their two opponents
too had not been able to resist the appeal of its foaming and
stunning flow of words.</p>

<p>So Axel Martini had been awarded fifteen pounds, a gold
breast-pin in the form of a lyre, and the Grand Duke's silver
cup as well, and his poem had been printed first in the annual,
surrounded with an artistic frame from the hand of Professor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>
von Lindemann. What was more, the custom was for the
victor (or victrix) in the &ldquo;May-combat&rdquo; to be received in
audience by the Grand Duke; and as Albrecht was unwell,
this task fell to his brother.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was a little afraid of Herr Martini.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, Doctor Ueberbein,&rdquo; he said when he met his tutor
one day, &ldquo;what subject am I to tackle him on? He's sure
to be a wild, brazen-faced fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Doctor Ueberbein answered: &ldquo;Anything; but, Klaus
Heinrich, you need not worry! He's a very decent fellow. I
know him, I'm rather in with his set. You'll get on splendidly
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Klaus Heinrich received the poet of the &ldquo;Joy of Life,&rdquo;
received him at the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; so as to give the business as
private a character as possible. &ldquo;In the yellow room, Braunbart
if you please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's the most presentable one
for occasions like this.&rdquo; There were three handsome chairs
in this room, which indeed were the only valuable pieces of
furniture in the Schloss, heavy Empire arm-chairs of
mahogany, with spiral arms and yellow upholstery on which
blue-green lyres were embroidered. Klaus Heinrich on this
occasion did not dispose himself ready for an audience, but
waited in some anxiety near by, until Axel Martini on his side
had waited for seven or eight minutes in the yellow room.
Then he walked in hastily, almost hurriedly, and advanced towards
the poet, who made a low bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much pleased to make your acquaintance,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;dear sir &hellip; dear Doctor, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Royal Highness,&rdquo; answered Axel Martini in an
asthmatic voice, &ldquo;not doctor, I've no title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, forgive me &hellip; I assumed &hellip; Let's sit down, dear
Herr Martini. I am, as I have said, delighted to be able to
congratulate you on your great success&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini drew down the corners of his mouth. He
sat down on the edge of one of the mahogany arm-chairs,
at the uncovered table, round whose edge ran a gold border,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>
and crossed his feet, which were cased in cracked patent-leather
boots. He was in frock-coat and wore yellow gloves. His
collar was frayed at the edges. He had rather staring eyes,
thin cheeks and a dark yellow moustache, which was clipped
like a hedge. His hair was already quite grey on the temples,
although according to the &ldquo;May-combat&rdquo; Annual he was not
more than thirty years old, and under his eyes glowed patches
of red which did not suggest robust health. He answered to
Klaus Heinrich's congratulations: &ldquo;Your Royal Highness is
very kind. It was not a difficult victory. Perhaps it was
hardly tactful of me to compete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich did not understand this; but he said: &ldquo;I
have read your poem repeatedly with great pleasure. It seems
to me a complete success, as regards both metre and rhyme.
And it entirely expresses the &lsquo;Joy of Life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini bowed in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your skill,&rdquo; continued Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;must be a source
of great pleasure to you&mdash;an ideal recreation. What is your
calling, Herr Martini?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini showed that he did not understand, by describing
a note of interrogation with the upper half of his
body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean your main calling. Are you in the Civil Service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Royal Highness, I have no calling; I occupy myself
exclusively with poetry&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None at all&hellip;. Oh, I understand. So unusual a gift
deserves that a man's whole powers be devoted to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know about that, Royal Highness. Whether it
deserves it or not, I don't know. I must own that I had no
choice. I have always felt myself entirely unsuited to every
other branch of human activity. It seems to me that this
undoubted and unconditional unsuitability for everything
else is the sole proof and touchstone of the poetical calling&mdash;indeed,
that a man must not see in poetry any calling, but
only the expression and refuge of that unsuitability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity with Herr Martini that when he talked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
tears came into his eyes just like a man who comes out of the
cold into a warm room and lets the heat stream through and
melt his limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's a singular idea,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Royal Highness. I beg your pardon, no, not
singular at all. It's an idea which is very generally accepted.
What I say is nothing new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for how long have you been living only for poetry?
I suppose you were once a student?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Royal Highness; no, the unsuitability to which
I alluded before began to show itself in me at an early age.
I couldn't get on at school. I left it without passing my
&lsquo;final.&rsquo; I went up to the university with the full intention of
taking it later, but I never did. And when my first volume of
poems attracted a good deal of attention, it no longer suited
my dignity to do so, if I may say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not&hellip;. But did your parents then agree to
your choice of a career?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Royal Highness! I must say to my parents' credit
that they by no means agreed to it. I come of a good stock:
my father was Solicitor to the Treasury. He's dead now, but
he was Solicitor to the Treasury. He naturally disliked my
choice of a career so much that till his death he would never
give me a farthing. I lived at daggers drawn with him, although
I had the greatest respect for him because of his
strictness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you've had a hard time of it, Herr Martini, you've
had to struggle through. I can well believe that you must
have knocked about a good deal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, Royal Highness! No, that would have been horrid,
I couldn't have stood it. My health is delicate&mdash;I dare not
say &lsquo;unfortunately,&rsquo; for I am convinced that my talent is inseparably
connected with my bodily infirmity. Neither my
body nor my talent could have survived hunger and harsh
winds, and they have not had to survive them. My mother
was weak enough to provide me behind my father's back with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
the means of life, modest but adequate means. I owe it to
her that my talent has been able to develop under fairly
favourable conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The result has shown, Herr Martini, that they were the
right conditions&hellip;. Although it is difficult to say now what
actually are good conditions. Permit me to suppose that if
your mother had shown herself as strict as your father, and
you had been alone in the world, and left entirely to your own
resources &hellip; don't you think that it might have been to a
certain extent a good thing for you? That you might have
got a peep at things, so to speak, which have escaped you as
it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People like me, Royal Highness, get peeps enough without
having actually to know what hunger is; and the idea is
fairly generally accepted that it is not actual hunger, but rather
hunger for the actual &hellip; ha, ha!&hellip; which talent requires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini had been obliged to laugh a little at his play
upon words. He now quickly raised one yellow-gloved hand
to his mouth with the hedge-like moustache, and improved his
laugh into a cough. Klaus Heinrich watched him with a look
of princely expectancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your Royal Highness will allow me&hellip;. It is a well-known
fact that the want of actuality for such as me is the
seed-ground of all talent, the fountain of inspiration, indeed
our suggestive genius. Enjoyment of life is forbidden to us,
strictly forbidden, we have no illusions as to that&mdash;and by
enjoyment of life I mean not only happiness, but also sorrow,
passion, in short every serious tie with life. The representation
of life claims all our forces, especially when those forces
are not allotted to us in overabundant measure&rdquo;&mdash;and Herr
Martini coughed, drawing his shoulders repeatedly forward as
he did so. &ldquo;Renunciation,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is our compact with
the Muse, in it reposes our strength, our value; and life is our
forbidden garden, our great temptation, to which we yield
sometimes, but never to our profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>The flow of words had again brought tears to Herr Martini's
eyes. He tried to blink them away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one of us,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;knows what it is to make
mistakes, to run off the rails in that way, to make greedy
excursions of that kind into the festival halls of life. But
we return thence into our isolation humbled and sick at
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini stopped. His look, from under his knotted
brows, became fixed for a moment and lost in vacancy, while
his mouth assumed a sour expression and his cheeks, on which
the unhealthy redness glowed, seemed even thinner than before.
It was only for a second; then he changed his position,
and his eyes recovered their vivacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your poem,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, with some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</i>.
&ldquo;Your prize poem to the &lsquo;Joy of Life,&rsquo; Herr
Martini&hellip;. I am really grateful to you for your achievement.
But will you please tell me &hellip; your poem&mdash;I've
read it attentively. It deals on the one hand with misery and
horrors, with the wickedness and cruelty of life, if I remember
rightly, and on the other hand with the enjoyment of
wine and fair women, does it not?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Martini laughed; then rubbed the corners of his
mouth with his thumb and forefinger, so as to wipe the laugh
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it's all,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;conceived in the
form of &lsquo;I,&rsquo; in the first person, isn't it? And yet it is not
founded on personal knowledge? You have not really experienced
any of it yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little, Royal Highness. Only quite trifling suggestions
of it. No, the fact is the other way round&mdash;that, if I
were the man to experience all that, I should not only not
write such poems, but should also feel entire contempt for
my present existence. I have a friend, his name is Weber;
he's a rich young man; he lives, he enjoys his life. His
favourite amusement consists in scorching in his motor car
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
at a mad pace over the country and picking up village girls
from the roads and fields on the way, with whom he<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but
that's another story. In short, that young man laughs
when he catches sight of me, he finds something so comic in
me and my activities. But as for me, I can quite understand
his amusement, and envy him it. I dare say that I too despise
him a little, but not so much as I envy and admire
him&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You admire him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Royal Highness. I cannot help doing so. He
spends, he squanders, he lets himself go in a most unconcerned
and light-hearted way&mdash;while it is my lot to save, anxiously
and greedily, to keep together, and indeed to do so on hygienic
grounds. For hygiene is what I and such as I most need&mdash;it
is our whole ethics. But nothing is more unhygienic than
life&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means that you will never empty the Grand Duke's
cup, then, Herr Martini?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink wine out of it? No, Royal Highness. Although
it would be fine to do so. But I never touch wine. And I
go to bed at ten, and generally take care of myself. If I
didn't, I should never have won the cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well believe it, Herr Martini. People who are not
behind the scenes get strange ideas of what a poet's life must
be like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite conceivably, Royal Highness. But it is, taken all
round, by no means a very glorious life, I can assure you,
especially as we aren't poets every hour of the twenty-four.
In order that a poem of that sort may come into existence
from time to time&mdash;who would believe how much idleness
and boredom and peevish laziness is necessary? The motto
on a picture postcard is often a whole day's work. We sleep
a lot, we idle about with heads feeling like lead. Yes, it's
too often a dog's life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one knocked lightly on the white-lacquered door. It
was Neumann's signal that it was high time for Klaus Heinrich
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
to change his clothes and have himself freshened up. For
there was to be a club concert that evening in the Old Schloss.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich rose. &ldquo;I've been gossiping,&rdquo; he said; for
that was the expression he used at such moments. And then
he dismissed Herr Martini, wished him success in his poetical
career, and accompanied the poet's respectful withdrawal with
a laugh and that rather theatrical up and down movement of the
hand which was not always equally effective, but which he
had brought to a high pitch of perfection.</p>

<p>Such was the Prince's conversation with Axel Martini, the
author of &ldquo;Evoë!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Holy Life.&rdquo; It gave him food
for thought, it continued to occupy his mind after it had ended.
He continued to think over it while Neumann was reparting his
hair and helping him on with the dazzling full-dress coat
with the stars, during the club concert at Court, and for several
days afterwards, and he tried to reconcile the poet's statements
with the rest of the experiences which life had vouchsafed
to him.</p>

<p>This Herr Martini, who, while the unhealthy flush glowed
under his eyes, kept crying: &ldquo;How beautiful, how strong is
life!&rdquo; yet was careful to go to bed at ten, shut himself off
from life on hygienic grounds, as he said, and avoided every
serious tie with it&mdash;this poet with his frayed collar, his
watery eyes, and his envy of the young Weber who scorched
over the country with village girls: he left a mixed impression,
it was difficult to come to any certain conclusion about
him. Klaus Heinrich expressed it, when he told his sister of
the meeting, by saying: &ldquo;Things are none too comfortable
and easy for him, that's quite obvious, and that certainly
entitles him to our sympathy. But somehow, I'm not sure if
I'm glad to have met him, for he has something deterrent about
him, Ditlinde&mdash;yes, after all, he's certainly a little repulsive.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>VII<br/>
<small>IMMA</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Fräulein von Isenschnibbe</span> had been well informed. On the
very evening of the day on which she had brought the Princess
zu Reid the great news, the <i>Courier</i> published the announcement
of Samuel Spoelmann's, the world-renowned Spoelmann's,
impending arrival, and ten days later, at the beginning of
October (it was the October of the year in which Grand Duke
Albrecht had entered his thirty-second and Prince Klaus Heinrich
his twenty-sixth year), thus barely giving time for public
curiosity to reach a really high point, his arrival became a
fact, a plain actuality on an autumn-tinged, entirely ordinary
week-day, which was destined to impress itself on the future as
a date to be remembered for ever.</p>

<p>The Spoelmanns arrived by special train&mdash;that was the only
distinction about their debut to start with, for everybody knew
that the &ldquo;Prince's suite&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Spa Court&rdquo; Hotel was by no
means <ins title="dazzingly">dazzlingly</ins> magnificent. A few idlers, guarded by a
small detachment of policemen, had gathered behind the platform
barriers; some representatives of the press were present.
But whoever expected anything out of the ordinary was disappointed.
Spoelmann would almost have passed unrecognized,
he was so unimposing. For a long time people took
his family physician for him (Doctor Watercloose, people said
he was called), a tall American, who wore his hat on the back
of his head and kept his mouth distended in a perpetual smile
between his close-trimmed white whiskers, the while he half-closed
his eyes. It was not till the last moment that people
learned that it was the little clean-shaven man in the faded
overcoat, he who wore his hat pulled down over his eyes, who
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>
was the actual Spoelmann, and the spectators were agreed that
there was nothing striking about him. All sorts of stories
had been in circulation about him; some witty fellow had
spread the report that Spoelmann had front teeth of solid
gold and a diamond set in the middle of each. But although
the truth or untruth of this report could not be tested at once&mdash;for
Spoelmann did not show his teeth, he did not laugh, but
rather seemed angry and irritated by his infirmity&mdash;yet when
they saw him nobody was any longer inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>As for Miss Spoelmann, his daughter, she had turned up
the collar of her fur coat, and stuffed her hands in the pockets,
so that there was hardly anything to be seen of her except a
pair of disproportionately big brown-black eyes, which swept
the crowd with a serious look whose meaning it was hard to
interpret. By her side stood the person whom the onlookers
identified as her companion, the Countess Löwenjoul, a woman
of thirty-five, plainly dressed and taller than either of the
Spoelmanns, who carried her little head with its thin smooth
hair pensively on one side, and kept her eyes fixed in front of
her with a kind of rigid meekness. What without question
attracted most attention was a Scottish sheep-dog which was
led on a cord by a stolid-looking servant&mdash;an exceptionally
handsome, but, as it appeared, terribly excitable beast, that
leaped and danced and filled the station with its frenzied barking.</p>

<p>People said that a few of Spoelmann's servants, male and
female, had already arrived at the &ldquo;Spa Court&rdquo; some hours
before. At any rate it was left to the servant with the dog
to look after the luggage by himself; and while he was doing
so his masters drove in two ordinary flies&mdash;Mr. Spoelmann
with Doctor Watercloose, Miss Spoelmann with the Countess&mdash;to
the Spa-Garden. There they got out, and there for six
weeks they led a life the cost of which it did not need all their
money to meet.</p>

<p>They were lucky; the weather was fine, it was a blue autumn,
a long succession of sunny days from October into November,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>
and Miss Spoelmann rode daily&mdash;that was her only luxury&mdash;with
her companion, on horses which she hired by the week
from the livery stables. Mr. Spoelmann did not ride, although
the <i>Courier</i>, with obvious reference to him, published a
note by its medical colleague according to which riding had
a soothing effect in cases of stone, owing to its jolting, and
helped to disperse the stone. But the hotel staff knew that the
famous man practised artificial riding within the four walls
of his room, with the help of a machine, a stationary velocipede
to whose saddle a jolting motion was imparted by the
working of the pedals.</p>

<p>He was a zealous drinker of the healing waters, the Ditlinde
Spring, by which he seemed to set great store. He
appeared first thing every morning in the Füllhaus, accompanied
by his daughter, who for her part was quite healthy,
and only drank with him for company's sake, and then, in
his faded coat and with his hat pulled over his eyes, took his
exercise in the Spa-Garden and Wandelhalle, drinking the
water the while through a glass tube out of a blue tumbler&mdash;watched
at a distance by the two American newspaper correspondents,
whose duty it was to telegraph to their papers a
thousand words daily about Spoelmann's holiday resort, and
who were therefore bound to try to get something to telegraph
about.</p>

<p>Otherwise he was rarely visible. His illness&mdash;kidney colic,
so people said, extremely painful attacks&mdash;seemed to confine
him often to his room, if not to his bed, and while Miss
Spoelmann with Countess Löwenjoul appeared two or three
times at the Court Theatre (when, in a black velvet dress with
an Indian silk scarf of a wonderful gold-yellow colour round
her fresh young shoulders, she looked quite bewitching with
her pearl-white complexion and great black pleading eyes),
her father was never seen in the box with her. He took, it
is true, in her company one or two drives through the capital,
to do some shopping, get some idea of the town, and see a
few select sights; he went for a walk with her too, through
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
the park and twice inspected there the Schloss Delphinenort&mdash;the
second time alone, when he was so much interested as to
take measurements of the walls with an ordinary yellow rule,
which he took out of his faded coat&hellip;. But he was never
seen in the dining-room of the &ldquo;Spa Court,&rdquo; for whether because
he was on an almost meatless diet, or for some other
reason, he took his meals exclusively with his own party in
his own rooms, and the curiosity of the public had on the
whole remarkably little to feed on.</p>

<p>The result was that Spoelmann's arrival at the Spa at first
did not prove so beneficial as Fräulein von Isenschnibbe and
many others beside her had expected. The export of bottles
increased, that was certain; it quickly rose to half as many
again as its previous figure, and remained at that. But the
influx of foreigners did not increase noticeably; the guests
who came to feast their eyes on so abnormal an existence soon
went away again, satisfied or disappointed, besides it was for
the most part not the most desirable elements of society that
were attracted by the millionaire's presence. Strange creatures
appeared in the streets, unkempt and wild-eyed creatures&mdash;inventors,
projectors, would-be benefactors of mankind, who
hoped to enlist Spoelmann's sympathies for their hobbies.
But the millionaire made himself absolutely inaccessible to
these people; indeed, purple with rage, he howled at one of
them who made advances towards him in the park, in such a
way that the busybody quickly skedaddled, and it was often
said that the torrent of begging letters which daily flowed in
to him&mdash;letters which often bore stamps which the officials of
the Grand Ducal post-office had never seen before&mdash;was at once
discharged into a paper-basket of quite unusual capacity.</p>

<p>Spoelmann seemed to have forbidden all business letters
to be sent him, seemed determined to enjoy his holiday to
the utmost, and during his travels in Europe to live exclusively
for his health&mdash;or ill-health. The <i>Courier</i>, whose reporter had
lost no time in making friends with his American colleagues,
was in a position to announce that a reliable man, a so-called
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
chief manager, was Mr. Spoelmann's representative in America.
He went on to say that his yacht, a gorgeously decorated vessel,
was awaiting the great man at Venice, and that as soon as he
had finished his cure he intended to travel south with his
party.</p>

<p>It told also, in answer to importunate requests from its
readers&mdash;of the romantic origin of the Spoelmann millions,
from their beginning in Victoria, whither his father had drifted
from some German office stool or other, young, poor, and
armed only with a pick, a shovel, and a tin plate. There he
had begun by working as help to a gold-digger, as a day
labourer, in the sweat of his brow. And then luck had come
to him. A man, a claim-owner on a small scale, had fared
so badly that he could no longer buy himself his tomatoes
and dry bread for dinner, and in his extremity had been
obliged to dispose of his claim. Spoelmann senior had bought
it, had staked his one card, and, with his whole savings,
amounting to £5 sterling, had bought this piece of alluvial
land called &ldquo;Paradise Field,&rdquo; not more than forty feet square.
And the next day he had turned up, a foot under the surface, a
nugget of pure gold, the tenth biggest nugget in the world,
the &ldquo;Paradise nugget,&rdquo; weighing 980 ounces and worth £5,000.</p>

<p>That, related the <i>Courier</i>, had been the beginning. Spoelmann's
father had emigrated to South America with the proceeds
of his find, to Bolivia, and as gold-washer, amalgam-mill-owner,
and mine-owner had continued to extract the yellow
metal direct from the rivers and the womb of the mountains.
Then and there Spoelmann senior had married&mdash;and
the <i>Courier</i> went so far as to hint in this connexion that he had
done so defiantly and without regard to the prejudices generally
felt in those parts. However, he had doubled his capital and
succeeded in investing his money most profitably.</p>

<p>He had moved on northwards to Philadelphia, Pa. That
was in the fifties, the time of a great boom in railway construction,
and Spoelmann had begun with one investment in
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway. He had also leased a coal-mine
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
in the west of the State, the profits from which had
been enormous. Finally he had joined that group of fortunate
young men which bought the famous Blockhead Farm
for a few thousand pounds&mdash;the property which, with its
petroleum wells, in a short time increased in value to a hundred
times its purchase price&hellip;. This enterprise had made
a rich man of Spoelmann senior, but he had by no means rested
on his oars, but unceasingly practised the art of making money
into more money, and finally into superabundant money.</p>

<p>He had started steel works, had floated companies for
the turning of iron into steel on a large scale, and for
building railway bridges. He had bought up the major
part of the shares of four or five big railway companies, and
had been elected in the later years of his life president, vice-president,
manager, or director of the companies. When the
Steel Trust was formed, so the <i>Courier</i> said, he had joined it,
with a holding of shares which guaranteed him an income of
$12,000,000. But at the same time he had been chief shareholder
and expert adviser of the Petroleum Combine, and in
virtue of his holding had dominated three or four of the other
Trust Companies. And at his death his fortune, reckoned in
German currency, had amounted to a round thousand million
marks.</p>

<p>Samuel, his only son, the offspring of that early marriage,
contracted in defiance of public opinion, had been his sole
heir&mdash;and the <i>Courier</i>, with its usual delicacy, interpolated a
remark to the effect that there was something almost sad in
the idea of any one, without himself contributing, and through
no fault of his own, being born to such a situation. Samuel
had inherited the palace on Fifth Avenue at New York, the
country mansions, and all the shares, Trust bonds, and
profits of his father; he inherited also the strange position to
which his father had risen, his world-fame and the hatred
directed by his out-distanced competitors against the power of
his gold&mdash;all the hatred to allay which he yearly distributed his
huge donations to colleges, conservatories, libraries, benevolent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
institutions, and that University which his father had
founded and which bore his name.</p>

<p>Samuel Spoelmann did not deserve the hatred of the out-distanced
competitors; that the <i>Courier</i> was sure of. He had
gone early into the business, and had controlled the bewildering
possessions of his house all by himself during his father's
last years. But everybody knew that his heart had never been
really in the business. His real inclinations had been, strange
to say, all along much more towards music and especially
organ music&mdash;and the truth of this information on the part
of the <i>Courier</i> was certain, for Mr. Spoelmann actually kept
a small organ in the &ldquo;Spa Court,&rdquo; whose bellows he got a hotel
servant to blow, and he could be heard from the Spa-Garden
playing it for an hour every day.</p>

<p>He had married for love and not at all from social considerations,
according to the <i>Courier</i>&mdash;a poor and pretty girl,
half German, half Anglo-Saxon by descent. She had died,
but she had left him a daughter, that wonderful blood-mixture
of a girl, whom we now had as guest within our walls and who
was at the time nineteen years old. Her name was Imma&mdash;a
real German name, as the <i>Courier</i> added, nothing more than
an old form of &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; and it might be remarked that the
daily conversation in the Spoelmann household, though interlarded
with scraps of English, had remained German. And
how devoted father and daughter seemed to be to each other!
Every morning, by going to the Spa-Garden at the right time,
one could watch Fräulein Spoelmann, who usually entered the
Füllhause a little later than her father, take his head between
her hands and give him his morning kiss on mouth and cheeks,
while he patted her tenderly on the back. Then they went
arm-in-arm through the Wandelhalle and sucked their glass
tubes as they went&hellip;.</p>

<p>That is how the well-informed journal gossiped and fed the
public curiosity. It also reported carefully the visits which
Miss Imma kindly paid with her companion to several of the
charitable institutions of the town. Yesterday she had made a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
detailed inspection of the public kitchens. To-day she had
made a prolonged tour of the Trinity Almhouses for old
women, and she had recently twice attended Privy Councillor
Klinghammer's lectures on the theory of numbers at the university&mdash;had
sat on the bench, a student among students, and
scribbled away with her fountain-pen, for everybody knew
that she was a learned girl and devoted to the study of algebra.
Yes, all that was absorbing reading, and furnished ample food
for conversation. But the topics which made themselves talked
about without any help from the <i>Courier</i> were, firstly, the
dog, that noble black-and-white collie which the Spoelmanns
had brought with them, and secondly, in a different way, the
companion, Countess Löwenjoul.</p>

<p>As for the dog, whose name was Percival, generally
shortened to Percy, he was an animal of so excitable and
emotional a disposition as beggared description. Inside the
hotel he afforded no grounds for complaint, but lay in a
dignified attitude on a small carpet outside the Spoelmanns'
suite. But every time he went out he had an attack of light-headedness,
which caused general interest and surprise, indeed
more than once actual obstruction of traffic.</p>

<p>Followed at a distance by a swarm of native dogs, common
curs which, incited by his demeanour, assailed him with censorious
yaps, and which caused him no concern whatever, he
flew through the streets, his nose spattered with foam and barking
wildly, pirouetted madly in front of the tramcars, made
the cab-horses stumble, and twice knocked Widow Klaaszen's
cake stall at the Town Hall down so violently that the sugar
cakes rolled half over the Market-place. But as Mr. Spoelmann
or his daughter at once met such catastrophes with more
than adequate compensation, as too it was discovered that
Percival's attacks were really quite free from danger, that he
was anything but inclined to bite and steal, but on the contrary
kept to himself and would let nobody come near him,
public opinion quickly turned in his favour, and to the children
in particular his excursions were a constant source of pleasure.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>Countess Löwenjoul on her side supplied food for conversation
in a quieter but no less strange way. At first,
when her personality and position were not yet known in the
city, she had attracted the gibes of the street urchins, because,
while out walking alone, she talked to herself softly and
deliberately, and accompanied her words with lively and at
the same time graceful and elegant gestures. But she had
shown such mildness and goodness to the children who shouted
after her and tugged at her dress, she had spoken to them with
such affection and dignity, that her persecutors had slunk
away abashed and confused, and later, when she became known,
respect for her relations with the famous guests secured her
from molestation. However, some unintelligible anecdotes
were secretly circulated about her. One man told how the
Countess had given him a gold piece with instructions that he
should box the ears of a certain old woman who was understood
to have made some unseemly proposal or other to her.
The man had pocketed the gold piece, without, however, discharging
his commission.</p>

<p>Further, it was declared as a fact that the Countess had
accosted the sentry in front of the Fusiliers' Barracks and had
told him at once to arrest the wife of the sergeant of one of
the companies because of her moral shortcomings. She had
written too a letter to the Colonel of the regiment to the
effect that all sorts of secret and unspeakable abominations
went on inside the barracks. Whether she was right in her
facts, heaven only knew. But many people at once concluded
that she was wrong in her head. At any rate, there was no
time to investigate the matter, for six weeks were soon past,
and Samuel N. Spoelmann, the millionaire, went away.</p>

<p>He went away after having had his portrait painted by
Professor von Lindemann&mdash;an expensive portrait too, which he
gave to the proprietor of the &ldquo;Spa Court&rdquo; as a memento; he
went away with his daughter, the Countess, and Doctor Watercloose,
with Percival, the chamber-velocipede, and his servants;
went by special train to the South, with the view of spending
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
the winter on the Riviera, whither the two New York journalists
had hastened ahead of him, and of then crossing back home
again. It was all over. The <i>Courier</i> wished Mr. Spoelmann
a hearty farewell and expressed the hope that the cure would be
found to have done him good.</p>

<p>And with that the notable interlude seemed to be closed and
done with. Everyday life claimed its due, and Mr. Spoelmann
began to fade into oblivion. The winter passed. It was the
winter in which her Grand Ducal Highness the Princess zu
Ried-Hohenried was confined of a daughter. Spring came,
and his Royal Highness Grand Duke Albrecht repaired as
usual to Hollerbrunn. But then a rumour cropped up amongst
the people and in the press, which was received at first with
a shrug by the sober-minded, but became more concrete,
crystallized, took to itself quite precise details, and finally won
itself a dominant place in the solid and pithy news of the
day.</p>

<p>What was toward? A Grand Ducal Schloss was about
to be sold? Nonsense! Which Schloss?&mdash;Delphinenort.
Schloss Delphinenort in the North Park? Twaddle! Sold?
To whom?&mdash;To Spoelmann. Ridiculous! What could he do
with it?&mdash;Restore it, and live in it. That's all very well.
But perhaps our Parliament might have something to say to
that.&mdash;They don't care twopence. Had the State any responsibility
for keeping up Schloss Delphinenort?&mdash;If they had, it's
a pity they hadn't recognized it, dear old place. No, Parliament
had no say in the matter. Have the negotiations advanced
at all far?&mdash;Rather, they're completed. Goodness gracious,
then of course the exact price is known?&mdash;Naturally. Sold
for two millions, not a farthing less. Impossible! A Royal
Palace! Royal palace be blowed! We're not talking of the
Grimmburg or of the Old Schloss. We're talking of a
country house, an unused country house which is falling in
pieces for lack of funds to keep it up.</p>

<p>So Spoelmann intended to come back every year and spend
several weeks in Delphinenort?&mdash;No. For he intended rather
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
to come and settle among us altogether. He was sick of America,
wanted to turn his back on it, and his first stay amongst us
was merely to spy out the land. He was ill, he wanted to
retire from business. He had always remained a German at
heart. The father had emigrated, and the son wanted to come
back home. He wished to take his part in the modest life and
intellectual resources of our country, and to spend the rest
of his days in the immediate neighbourhood of the Ditlinde
Spa.</p>

<p>All was confusion and bustle, and discussions without end.
But public opinion, with the exception of the voices of a few
grumblers, trended after a short hesitation in favour of the
idea of sale; indeed without this general approval the matter
could never have gone very far. It was House Minister von
Knobelsdorff who first ventured on a cautious announcement
of Spoelmann's offer in the daily press. He had waited and
allowed the popular feeling to come to a decision. And after
the first confusion, solid reasons in favour of the project had
made themselves felt.</p>

<p>The business world was enchanted at the idea of having so
doughty a consumer at its doors. The æsthetes showed
themselves delighted at the prospect of seeing Schloss Delphinenort
restored and kept up&mdash;at seeing the noble old building
restored to honour and youth in so unforeseen, indeed so
romantic a way. But the economically-minded brought forward
figures which were calculated to cause grave misgivings
as to the financial position of the country. If Samuel N.
Spoelmann settled among us, he would become a tax-payer&mdash;he
would have to pay us his income-tax.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was worth while showing what that meant. Mr.
Spoelmann would be left to declare his own income, but, from
what one knew&mdash;and knew fairly accurately&mdash;his residence
would mean a yearly revenue of two and a half millions, in
taxes alone, not to mention what he paid in rates. Worth
thinking about, wasn't it? The question was put straight to
the Finance Minister, Dr. Krippenreuther. He would be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
wanting in his duty if he did not do all he could to recommend
the sale in the highest quarters. For patriotism demanded
that Spoelmann's offer should be accepted, and
patriotism was paramount above all other considerations.</p>

<p>So Excellency von Knobelsdorff had had an interview with
the Grand Duke. He had informed his master of the public
opinion, had added that the price offered, two millions, considerably
exceeded the real value of the Schloss in its present
condition, had remarked that such a sum meant a real windfall
for the Treasury, and had ended by slipping in a hint
about the central heating of the Old Schloss, which, if the sale
was carried through, would no longer be an impossibility.
In short, the single-minded old gentleman had brought his
whole influence to bear in favour of the sale, and had recommended
the Grand Duke to bring the matter before a family
moot. Albrecht had sucked his lower lip softly against the
upper, and summoned the family moot. It had met in the
Hall of the Knights over tea and biscuits. Only two feminine
members, the Princess Catherine and Ditlinde, had opposed
the sale, on the ground of loss of dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be misunderstood, Albrecht!&rdquo; said Ditlinde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will charge you with want of respect to your high
station, and that is not right, for you have on the contrary
too much; you are so proud, Albrecht, that everything is all
the same to you. But I say No. I do not wish to see a Cr&oelig;sus
living in one of your Schlosses, it is not right, and it was bad
enough that he should have a family physician and take the
Prince's suite in the Spa Court. The <i>Courier</i> harps on the
fact that he is a tax-paying subject, but in my eyes he is
simply a subject and nothing else. What do you think, Klaus
Heinrich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Klaus Heinrich voted for the sale. In the first place,
Albrecht got his central heating; secondly, Spoelmann was
not one of the common herd, he was not soap-boiler Unschlitt&mdash;he
was an exception, and there was no disgrace in letting him
have Delphinenort. Finally Albrecht had, with downcast
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
eyes, pronounced the whole family moot to be a farce. The
people had long ago made up their minds, his Ministers urged
the sale, and there was nothing left for him to do but to
&ldquo;wave to the engine-driver and start the train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The family moot had taken place in spring. From that
time onwards the negotiations for sale, which were carried
on between Spoelmann on the one hand and the Lord Marshal
von Bühl zu Bühl on the other, had proceeded apace, and the
summer was not far advanced before Schloss Delphinenort with
its park and out-buildings had become the lawful property of
Mr. Spoelmann.</p>

<p>Then began a scene of bustle and confusion round and in
the Schloss, which daily attracted crowds to the northern side
of the park. Delphinenort was improved and partly reconstructed
inside by a swarm of workmen. For quick, quick,
was the order of the day, that was Spoelmann's wish, and he
had only allowed five months' respite for everything to be ready
for him to enter into possession. So a wooden scaffold with
ladders and platforms shot up at lightning speed round the
dilapidated old building, foreign workmen swarmed all over
it, and an architect came with carte blanche over the seas to
superintend the work. But the greater part of the work fell
to our native manual workers to perform, and the stone-masons
and tilers, the joiners, gilders, upholsterers, glaziers,
and parquet-layers of the city, the landscape gardeners and
heating and lighting experts, had plenty of remunerative work
all through the summer and autumn.</p>

<p>When his Royal Highness Klaus Heinrich left his window
in the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; open, the noise of the work at Delphinenort
penetrated right through to the Empire room, and he
often drove past the Schloss amid the respectful greetings of
the public, in order to satisfy himself of the progress of the
restoration. The gardener's cottage was painted up, the sheds
and stables, which were destined to accommodate Spoelmann's
fleet of motors and carriages, were enlarged; and by October,
furniture and carpets, chests and cases full of stuffs and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
household utensils had been delivered at Schloss Delphinenort,
while it was whispered among the bystanders that inside
the walls skilled hands were at work fitting Spoelmann's
costly organ, which had been sent from over the sea, with
electric action.</p>

<p>There was much excitement to know whether the park belonging
to the Schloss, which had been so splendidly cleaned
up and trimmed, was to be fenced off from the public by a
wall or hedge. But nothing of the sort was done. It was
Spoelmann's wish that the property should continue to be
accessible, that no restraint should be placed on the citizens'
enjoyment of the park. The Sunday promenaders should have
access right up to the Schloss, up to the clipped hedge which
surrounded the big square pond&mdash;and this did not fail to make
an excellent impression on the population; indeed, the <i>Courier</i>
published a special article on the subject, in which it praised
Mr. Spoelmann for his philanthropy.</p>

<p>And behold! when the leaves again began to fall, exactly
one year after his first appearance, Samuel Spoelmann landed
a second time at our railway station. This time the general
interest in the event was much greater than in the preceding
year, and it is on record that, when Mr. Spoelmann, in his
well-known faded coat and with his hat over his eyes, left his
saloon, loud cheers were raised by the crowd of spectators&mdash;an
expression of feelings which Mr. Spoelmann seemed rather
inclined to resent, and which not he but Doctor Watercloose
acknowledged with blinking eyes and a broad smile. When
Miss Spoelmann too alighted, a cheer was raised, and one or
two urchins even shouted when Percy, the collie, appeared
springing, leaping, and altogether beside himself, on the platform.
In addition to the doctor and Countess Löwenjoul there
were two unknown persons in attendance, two clean-shaven
and decided-looking men in strangely roomy coats. They
were Mr. Spoelmann's secretaries, Messrs. Phlebs and Slippers,
as the <i>Courier</i> announced in its report.</p>

<p>At that time Delphinenort was far from ready, and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
Spoelmanns at once took possession of the first floor of the
chief hotel, where a big, haughty, paunch-bellied man in black,
the steward or butler of the Spoelmann establishment, who
had preceded them, had made preparations for them, and put
the chamber-velocipede together with his own hands. Every
day, while Miss Imma with her Countess and Percy went for
a ride or a visit to some charitable institution, Mr. Spoelmann
hung about his house, superintending the work and giving
orders, and when the end of the year approached, just after
the first snow had fallen, prospect became fact, and the
Spoelmanns took up their abode in Schloss Delphinenort.
Two motor cars (their arrival had been watched with interest&mdash;splendid
cars they were) bore the six members of the party&mdash;Messrs.
Phlebs and Slippers sat in the hinder one&mdash;driven
by the leather-clad chauffeurs, with servants in snow-white fur
coats and crossed arms beside them, in a few minutes from
the hotel through the City Gardens; and as the cars dashed
along the noble chestnut avenue which led to the drive, the
urchins climbed up the high lamp-posts which stood at all
four corners of the big spa-basin, and waved their caps and
cheered&hellip;.</p>

<p>So Spoelmann and his belongings settled down among us,
and we basked in the light of his presence. His white-and-gold
livery was seen and known in the city, just as the brown-and-gold
Grand Ducal livery was seen and known; the negro
in scarlet plush who was doorkeeper at Delphinenort soon
became a popular figure, and when passers-by heard the subdued
rumble of Mr. Spoelmann's organ from the interior of
the Schloss they lifted a finger and said: &ldquo;Hark, he's playing.
That means that he's not got colic for the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Imma was to be seen daily by the side of Countess
Löwenjoul, followed by a groom and with Percy capering
round, riding, or driving a smart four-in-hand through the
City Gardens&mdash;while the servant who sat on the back seat
stood up from time to time, drew a long silver horn from a
leather sheath and wound a shrill warning of their approach;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>
and by getting up early one could see father and daughter
every morning go in a dark-red brougham, or, in fine weather,
on foot through the park of Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; to the Spa-Garden,
in order to drink the waters. Imma for her part, as
already mentioned, again began a course of visits to the
benevolent institutions of the city, though she appeared not to
give up her studies for all that; for from the beginning of the
half-term she regularly attended the lectures of the Councillor
Klinghammer at the University&mdash;sat daily in a black dress
with white collar and cuffs among the young students in the
lecture-theatre, and drove her fountain-pen&mdash;with her fore-finger
raised in the air, a trick of hers when writing&mdash;over the
pages of her notebook.</p>

<p>The Spoelmanns lived in retirement, they did not mix in the
life of the town, as was natural in view both of Mr. Spoelmann's
ill-health and of his social loneliness. What social
group could he have attached himself to? Nobody even
suggested to him that he should consort with soap-boiler Unschlitt
or bank-director Wolfsmilch on confidential terms.
Yet he was soon approached with appeals to his generosity,
and the appeals were not in vain. For Mr. Spoelmann, who,
it was well known, before his departure from America had
given a large sum in dollars to the Board of Education in the
United States, and had also stated in so many words that he
had no intention of withdrawing his yearly contributions to
the Spoelmann University and his other educational foundations&mdash;he,
shortly after his arrival at &ldquo;Delphinenort,&rdquo; put his
name down for a subscription of ten thousand marks to the
Dorothea Children's Hospital, for which a collection was
just being made; an action the nobleness of which was immediately
recognized in fitting terms by the <i>Courier</i> and the
rest of the press.</p>

<p>In fact, although the Spoelmanns lived in seclusion in a
social sense, a certain amount of publicity attached to their
life among us from the earliest moments, and in the local
section of the daily newspapers at least their movements were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
followed with as much particularity as those of the members
of the Grand Ducal House. The public were informed when
Miss Imma had played a game of lawn tennis with the Countess
and Messrs. Phlebs and Slippers in the &ldquo;Delphinenort&rdquo; park;
it was noted when she had been at the Court Theatre, and
whether her father had gone with her for an act or two of
the Opera; and if Mr. Spoelmann shrank from curiosity, never
leaving his box during the intervals and scarcely ever showing
himself on foot in the streets, yet he was obviously not
insensible to the duties of a spectacular kind which were
inherent in an extraordinary existence like his own, and he
gave the love of gazing its due.</p>

<p>It has been said that the &ldquo;Delphinenort&rdquo; park was not
divided from the Town Gardens. No walls separated the
Schloss from the outer world. From the back one could
walk over the turf right up to the foot of the broad covered
terrace which had been built on that side, and, if bold enough,
look through the big glass door straight into the high white-and-gold
garden-room in which Mr. Spoelmann and his family
had five-o'clock tea. Indeed, when summer came, tea was laid
on the terrace outside, and Mr. and Miss Spoelmann, the
Countess and Doctor Watercloose sat in basket chairs of a
new-fangled shape, and took their tea as if on a public platform.</p>

<p>For on Sunday, at any rate, there was never wanting a
public to enjoy the spectacle at a respectful distance. They
called each other's attention to the silver tea-kettle, which was
heated by electricity&mdash;a quite novel idea&mdash;and to the wonderful
liveries of the two footmen who handed the tea and cakes,
white, high-buttoned, gold-laced coats with swan's-down on
the collars, cuffs, and seams. They listened to the English-German
conversation and followed with open mouths every
movement of the notable family on the terrace. They then
went round past the front door, in order to shout a few
witticisms in the local dialect to the red-plush negro, which
he answered with a dental grin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>Klaus Heinrich saw Imma Spoelmann for the first time
on a bright winter's day at noon. That does not mean that
he had not already caught sight of her often at the theatre,
in the street, and in the town park. But that's quite a different
thing. He saw her for the first time at this midday
hour in exciting circumstances.</p>

<p>He had been giving &ldquo;free audiences&rdquo; in the Old Schloss
till half-past eleven, and after they were finished had not
returned at once to Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; but had ordered his
coachman to keep the carriage waiting in one of the courts,
as he wished to smoke a cigarette with the Guards officers
on duty. As he wore the uniform of that regiment, to which
his personal aide-de-camp also belonged, he made an effort
to maintain the semblance of some sort of camaraderie with
the officers; he dined from time to time in their mess and
occasionally gave them half an hour of his company on guard,
although he had a dim suspicion that he was rather a nuisance
as he kept them from their cards and smoking-room stories.</p>

<p>So there he stood, the convex silver star of the Noble Order
of the Grimmburg Griffin on his breast, his left hand planted
well back on his hip, with Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf,
who had given due notice of the visit in the officers' mess,
which was situated on the ground floor of the Schloss near the
Albrechts Gate&mdash;engaged in a trivial conversation with two
or three officers in the middle of the room, while a further
group of officers chatted at the deep-set window. Owing to
the warmth of sun outside the window stood open, and from
the barracks along the Albrechtstrasse came the strains of the
drum and fife band of the approaching relief guard.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock struck from the Court Chapel tower. The
loud &ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; of the non-commissioned officer was heard
outside, and the rattle of grenadiers standing to arms. The
public collected on the square. The lieutenant on duty hastily
buckled on his sword belt, clapped his heels together in a
salute to Klaus Heinrich and went out. Then suddenly
Lieutenant von Sturmhahn, who had been looking out of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
window, cried with that rather poor imitation of familiarity
which was proper to the relations between Klaus Heinrich and
the officers: &ldquo;Great heavens, here's something for you to look
at, Royal Highness! There goes Miss Spoelmann, with her
algebra under her arm&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich walked to the window. Miss Imma was
walking by herself along the pavement. With both hands
thrust into her big flat muff, which was trimmed with pendent
tails, she carried her notebook pressed to her side with
her elbow. She was wearing a long coat of shiny black fox,
and a toque of the same fur on her dark foreign-looking hair.
She was obviously coming from &ldquo;Delphinenort&rdquo; and hurrying
towards the University. She reached the main guard-house
at the moment at which the relief guard marched up
the gutter, over against the guard on duty, which standing at
attention in two ranks occupied the pavement. She was
absolutely compelled to go round, outside the band and the
crowd of spectators&mdash;indeed, if she wished to avoid the open
square with its tram-lines, to make a fairly wide detour on the
footpath running round it&mdash;or to wait for the end of the military
ceremony.</p>

<p>She showed no intention of doing either. She made as if
to walk along the pavement in front of the Schloss right
down between the two ranks of soldiers. The sergeant with
the harsh voice stepped forward quickly. &ldquo;Not this way!&rdquo; he
cried and held the butt of his rifle in front of her. &ldquo;Not
this way! Right about! Wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Spoelmann fired up. &ldquo;What d'you mean?&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I'm in a hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her words were not so impressive as the expression of
honest, passionate, irresistible anger with which they were
uttered. How slight and lonely she was! The fair-haired
soldiers round her towered head and shoulders above her. Her
face was as pale as wax at this moment, her black eyebrows
were knitted in a hard and expressive wrinkle, her nostrils
distended, and her eyes, black with excitement and wide-opened,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
spoke so expressive and bewitching a language that no protest
seemed possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d'you mean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'm in a hurry!&rdquo; And
as she said it she pushed the rifle-butt, and the stupefied
sergeant with it, aside, and walked down between the lines,
went straight on her way, turned to the left into Universitätsstrasse
and vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm dammed!&rdquo; cried Lieutenant von Sturmhahn. &ldquo;That's
one for us!&rdquo; The officers at the window laughed. The spectators
outside, too, were much amused, and not unsympathetic.
Klaus Heinrich joined in the general hilarity. The changing
of the guard proceeded with loud words of command and
snatches of march tunes. Klaus Heinrich returned to the
&ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lunched all alone, went for a ride in the afternoon on
his brown horse Florian, and spent the evening at a big party
at Dr. Krippenreuther, the Finance Minister's house. He
related to several people with great animation the episode of
the guard, although the story had already gone the round and
become common property. Next day he had to go away, for
he had been told by his brother to represent him at the
inauguration of the new Town Hall in a neighbouring town.
For some reason or other, he went reluctantly, he disliked
leaving the capital. He had a feeling that he was missing an
important, pleasant, though rather disquieting opportunity,
which imperatively demanded his presence. And yet his
exalted calling must be more important. But while he sat
serene and gorgeously dressed on his seat of honour in the
Town Hall, and read his speech to the Mayor, Klaus Heinrich's
thoughts were not concentrated on the figure he
presented to the eyes of the crowd, but rather were busied with
this new and important topic. He also gave a passing thought
to a person whose casual acquaintance he had made long
years before, to Fräulein Unschlitt, the soap-boiler's daughter&mdash;a
memory which had a certain connexion with the importunate
topic&hellip;.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>Imma Spoelmann pushed the harsh-voiced sergeant aside in
her anger&mdash;walked all alone, her algebra under her arm, down
the ranks of the big fair-haired grenadiers. How pearly-white
her face was against her black hair under her fur toque,
and how her eyes spoke! There was nobody like her. Her
father was rich, surfeited with riches, and had bought one of
the Grand Ducal Schlosses. What was it that the <i>Courier</i> had
said about his undeserved reputation and the &ldquo;romantic isolation
of his life&rdquo;? He was the object of the hatred of aggrieved
rivals&mdash;that was the effect of the article. And her nostrils had
distended with anger. There was nobody like her, nobody
near or far. She was an exception. And suppose she had
been at the Citizens' Ball on that occasion? He would then
have had a companion, would not have made a fool of himself,
and would not have ended the evening in despair. &ldquo;Down,
down, down with him!&rdquo; Phew! Just think of how she looked
as she walked, dark and pale and wonderful, down the ranks
of fair-haired soldiers.</p>

<p>These were the thoughts which occupied Klaus Heinrich
during the next few days&mdash;just these three or four mental
pictures. And the strange thing is that they were amply sufficient
for him, and that he did not want any more. But all
things considered, it seemed to him more than desirable that he
should get another glimpse of the pearly-white face soon,
to-day if possible.</p>

<p>In the evening he went to the Court Theatre, where <i>The
Magic Flute</i> was being played. And when from his box he
descried Miss Spoelmann next to Countess Löwenjoul in the
front of the circle, a tremor went right through him. During
the opera he could watch her out of the darkness through his
opera-glasses, for the light from the stage fell on her. She
laid her head on her small, ringless hand, while she rested
her bare arm on the velvet braid, and she did not look angry
now. She wore a dress of glistening sea-green silk with a
light scarf on which bright flowers were embroidered, and
round her neck a long chain of sparkling diamonds. She
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
really was not so small as she looked, Klaus Heinrich decided,
when she stood up at the end of the act. No, the childish
shape of her head and the narrowness of her shoulders accounted
for her looking such a little thing. Her arms were
well developed, and one could see that she played games and
rode. But at the wrist her arm looked like a child's.</p>

<p>When the passage came: &ldquo;He is a prince. He is more than
that,&rdquo; Klaus Heinrich conceived the wish to have a talk with
Doctor Ueberbein. Doctor Ueberbein called by chance next
day at the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; in a black frock-coat and white tie,
as usual when he paid Klaus Heinrich a visit. Klaus Heinrich
asked him whether he had already heard the story of the
changing of the guard. Yes, answered Doctor Ueberbein,
several times. But would Klaus Heinrich like to relate it to
him again?&hellip; &ldquo;No, not if you know it,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich,
disappointed. Then Doctor Ueberbein jumped to quite
another topic. He began to talk about opera-glasses, and remarked
that opera-glasses were a wonderful invention. They
brought close what was unfortunately a long way off, did they
not? They formed a bridge to a longed-for goal. What did
Klaus Heinrich think? Klaus Heinrich was inclined to agree
to a certain extent. And it seemed that yesterday evening, so
people said, he had made a free use of this grand invention,
said the doctor. Klaus Heinrich could not see the point of
this remark.</p>

<p>Then Doctor Ueberbein said: &ldquo;No, look here, Klaus Heinrich,
that won't do. You are stared at, and little Imma is
stared at, and that's enough. If you add to it by staring at
little Imma, that's too much. You must see that, surely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, Doctor Ueberbein, I never thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in other cases you generally do think of that sort
of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've felt so funny for the last few days,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>Doctor Ueberbein leaned back, pulled at his red beard near
his throat, and nodded slowly with his head and neck.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>&ldquo;Really? Have you?&rdquo; he asked. And then went on nodding.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich said: &ldquo;You can't think how reluctant I
was to go the other day to the inauguration of the Town
Hall. And to-morrow I have to superintend the swearing-in
of the Grenadier recruits. And then comes the Chapter of
the Family Order. I don't feel a bit in the mood for that. I
find no pleasure in doing my duty as the representative of
my people. I've no inclination for my so-called lofty calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry to hear it!&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I might have known that you would be angry, Doctor
Ueberbein. Of course you'll call it sloppiness, and will read
me a sermon about &lsquo;destiny and discipline,&rsquo; if I know you.
But at the opera yesterday I thought of you at one point, and
asked myself whether you really were so right in several
particulars&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Klaus Heinrich, once already, if I'm not mistaken,
I've dragged your Royal Highness out of the mud, so
to speak&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was quite different, Doctor Ueberbein! How I wish
you could see that was absolutely different! That was at
the Citizens' Ball, but it was years ago, and I don't feel a
twinge in that direction. For she is &hellip; Look you, you have
often explained to me what you understand by &lsquo;Highness,&rsquo; and
that it is something affecting, and something to be approached
with tender sympathy. Don't you think that she of whom we
are speaking, that she is affecting and that one must feel
sympathy with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein. &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You often said that one must not disavow exceptions, that
to do so was sloppiness and slovenly and good-nature. Don't
you think that she too of whom we are speaking is an exception?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Ueberbein was silent. Then he said suddenly and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
decidedly, &ldquo;And now I, if possible, am to help to make two
exceptions into a rule?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he went out. He said that he must get back
to his work, emphasizing the word &ldquo;work,&rdquo; and begged leave
to withdraw. He took his departure in a strangely ceremonious
and unfatherly way.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich did not see him for ten or twelve days.
He asked him to lunch once, but Doctor Ueberbein begged
to be excused, his work at the moment was too pressing.
At last he came spontaneously. He was in high spirits and
looked greener than ever. He blustered about this and that,
and at last came to the subject of the Spoelmanns, looking at
the ceiling and pulling at his throat when he did so. To be
quite fair, he said, there was a striking amount of sympathy
felt with Samuel Spoelmann, one could see all over the town
how much beloved he was. Chiefly of course as an object
of taxation, but in other respects too. There was simply a
penchant for him, in every class, for his organ-playing and his
faded coat and his kidney-colic. Every errand boy was proud
of him, and if he were not so unapproachable and morose he
would already have been made to feel it.</p>

<p>The ten-thousand marks donation for the Dorothea Hospital
had naturally made an excellent impression. His friend
Sammet had told him (Ueberbein) that with the help of this
donation far-reaching improvements had been undertaken in
the Hospital. And for the rest, it had just occurred to him!
Little Imma was going to inspect the improvements to-morrow
morning, Sammet had told him. She had sent one of her
swan's-down flunkeys and asked whether she would be welcome
to-morrow. She and sick children were a devilish funny mixture,
opined Ueberbein, but perhaps she might learn something.
To-morrow morning at eleven, if his memory did not
mislead him.</p>

<p>Then he talked about other things. On leaving he added:
&ldquo;The Grand Duke ought to take some interest in the Dorothea
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
Hospital, Klaus Heinrich, it's expected of him. It's a blessed
institution. In short, somebody ought to show the way, give
signs of an interest in high quarters. No wish to intrude&hellip;.
And so good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he came back once more, and in his green face a flush
had appeared under the eyes which looked entirely out of
place there. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;I ever caught you
again with a soup tureen on your head, Klaus Heinrich, I
should leave it there.&rdquo; Then he pressed his lips together and
went out.</p>

<p>Next morning shortly before eleven Klaus Heinrich walked
with Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf, his aide-de-camp, from
Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; through the snow-covered birch avenue
over rough suburban streets between humble cottages, and
stopped before the neat white house over whose entrance
&ldquo;Dorothea Children's Hospital&rdquo; was painted in broad black
letters. His visit had been announced. The senior surgeon
of the institution, in a frock-coat with the Albrechts Cross of
the Third Class, was awaiting him with two younger surgeons
and the nursing staff in the hall. The Prince and his companion
were wearing helmets and fur coats. Klaus Heinrich
said: &ldquo;This is the renewal of an old acquaintance, my dear
doctor. You were present when I came into the world. You
are also a friend of my tutor Ueberbein's. I am delighted to
meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Sammet, who had grown grey in his life of active
philanthropy, bowed to one side, with one hand on his watch-chain
and his elbows close to his ribs. He presented the two
junior surgeons and the sister to the Prince, and then said:
&ldquo;I must explain to your Royal Highness that your Royal
Highness's gracious visit coincides with another visit. Yes.
We are expecting Miss Spoelmann. Her father has done such
a lot for our institution&hellip;. We could not very well upset
the arrangements. The sister will take Miss Spoelmann
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich received the news of this rencontre without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
displeasure. He first expressed his opinion of the nurses' uniform,
which he called becoming, and then his curiosity to inspect
the philanthropic institution. The tour began. The
sister and three nurses waited behind in the hall.</p>

<p>All the walls in the building were whitewashed and washable.
Yes. The water taps were huge, they were meant to
be worked with the elbows for reasons of cleanliness. And
rinsing apparatus had been installed for washing the milk-bottles.
One passed first through the reception room, which
was empty save for a couple of disused beds and the surgeons'
bicycles. In the adjoining preparation room there were, besides
the writing-table and the stand with the students' white
coats, a kind of folding table with oil-cloth cushions, an
operating-table, a cupboard of provisions, and a trough-shaped
perambulator. Klaus Heinrich paused at the provisions and
asked for the recipes for the preparations to be explained to
him. Doctor Sammet thought to himself that if the whole
tour was going to be made with such attention to details,
a terrible lot of time would be wasted.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise was heard in the street. An automobile
drove up tooting and stopped in front of the building.
Cheers were heard distinctly in the preparation room, for all
that it was only children that were shouting. Klaus Heinrich
did not pay any particular attention to the incident. He was
looking at a box of sugar of milk, which, by the way, had
nothing striking about it. &ldquo;A visitor apparently,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Oh, of course, you said somebody was coming. Let's go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party proceeded to the kitchen, the milk-kitchen, the
big boiler-fitted room for the preparing of milk, the place
where full milk, boiled milk, and buttermilk were kept. The
daily rations were set on clean white tables in little bottles
side by side. The place smelt sourish and sickly.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich gave his undivided attention to this room
also. He went so far as to taste the buttermilk, and pronounced
it excellent. How the children must thrive, he considered,
on buttermilk like that. During this inspection the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
door opened and Miss Spoelmann entered between the sister
and Countess Löwenjoul, followed by the three nurses.</p>

<p>The coat, toque, and muff which she was wearing to-day
were made of the costliest sable, and her muff was suspended
on a golden chain set with coloured stones. Her black hair
showed a tendency to fall in smooth locks over her forehead.
She took in the room at a glance; her eyes were really almost
unbecomingly big for her little face, they dominated it like
a cat's, save that they were black as anthracite and spoke a
pleading language of their own&hellip;. Countess Löwenjoul,
with a feather hat and dressed neatly and not without distinction,
as usual, smiled in a detached sort of way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The milk-kitchen,&rdquo; said the sister; &ldquo;this is where the milk
is cooked for the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So one would have supposed,&rdquo; answered Miss Spoelmann.
She said it quickly and lightly, with a pout of her lips and a
little haughty wag of her head. Her voice was a double one;
it consisted of a lower and a higher register, with a break in
the middle.</p>

<p>The sister was quite disconcerted. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's
obvious.&rdquo; And a little pained look of bewilderment was
visible in her face.</p>

<p>The position was a complicated one. Doctor Sammet looked
in Klaus Heinrich's face for orders, but as Klaus Heinrich
was accustomed to do what was put before him according to
prescribed forms, but not to grapple with novel and complex
situations, no solution of the difficulty was forthcoming.
Herr von Braunbart was on the point of intervening, and Miss
Spoelmann on the other side was making ready to leave the
milk-kitchen, when the Prince made a gesture with his right
hand which established a connexion between himself and the
young girl. This was the signal for Doctor Sammet to advance
towards Imma Spoelmann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Sammet. Yes.&rdquo; He desired the honour of presenting
Miss Spoelmann to his Royal Highness&hellip;. &ldquo;Miss
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>
Spoelmann, Royal Highness, the daughter of Mr. Spoelmann
to whom this hospital is so much indebted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich clapped his heels together and held out his
hand in its white gauntlet, and, laying her small brown-gloved
hand in it, she gave him a horizontal hand-shake, English
fashion, at the same time making a sort of shy curtsey, without
taking her big eyes off Klaus Heinrich's face. He could
think of nothing more original to say than: &ldquo;So you too
are paying a visit to the hospital, Miss Spoelmann?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she answered as quickly as before, with a pout and
the little haughty wag of her head. &ldquo;Nobody can deny that
everything points in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Braunbart involuntarily raised his hand, Doctor Sammet
looked down at his watch-chain in silence, and a short
snigger escaped through the nose of one of the young surgeons,
which was hardly opportune. The little pained look
of bewilderment now showed on Klaus Heinrich's face. He
said: &ldquo;Of course&hellip;. As you are here&hellip;. So I shall be
able to visit the institution in your company, Miss Spoelmann&hellip;.
Captain von Braunbart, my aide-de-camp&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; he added
quickly, recognizing that his remark laid him open to a
similar answer to the last. She responded by: &ldquo;Countess
Löwenjoul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess made a dignified bow&mdash;with an enigmatic
smile, a side glance into the unknown, which had something
seductive about it. When, however, she let her strangely
evasive gaze again dwell on Klaus Heinrich, who stood before
her in a composed and military attitude, the laugh vanished
from her face, an expression of sadness settled on her features,
and for a second a look of something like hatred for Klaus
Heinrich shone in her slightly swollen grey eyes. It was only
a passing look. Klaus Heinrich had no time to notice it,
and forgot it immediately. The two young surgeons were
presented to Imma Spoelmann, and then Klaus Heinrich suggested
that they should continue the tour all together.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>They went upstairs to the first story; Klaus Heinrich and
Imma Spoelmann in front, conducted by Doctor Sammet, then
Countess Löwenjoul with Herr von Braunbart, and the young
surgeons in the rear. Yes, the older children were here, up
to fourteen years of age. An ante-room with wash-basins
divided the girls' and the boys' rooms. In white bedsteads,
with a name-plate at the head and a frame at the foot enclosing
the <ins title="temperature-and">temperature- and</ins> weight-charts&mdash;tended by nurses in
white caps, and surrounded by cleanliness and tidiness&mdash;lay
the sick children, and coughs filled the room while Klaus
Heinrich and Imma Spoelmann walked down between the rows.</p>

<p>He walked at her left hand, out of courtesy, with the same
smile as when he visited exhibitions or inspected veterans,
gymnastic associations, or guards of honour. But every time
he turned his head to the right he found that Imma Spoelmann
was watching him&mdash;he met her great black eyes, which
were directed at him in a searching, questioning way. It was
so peculiar, he never remembered experiencing anything so
peculiar before, her way of looking at him with her great eyes,
without any respect for him or anyone else, absolutely unembarrassed
and free, quite unconcerned whether anybody noticed
it or not.</p>

<p>When Doctor Sammet stopped at a bed to describe the
case&mdash;the little girl's, for instance, whose broken white-bandaged
leg stuck straight out along the bed&mdash;Miss Spoelmann
listened attentively to him, that was quite clear; but
while she listened she did not look at the speaker, but her
eyes rested in turn on Klaus Heinrich and the pinched, quiet
child who, her hands folded on her breast, gazed up at them
from her back-rest&mdash;rested in turn on the Prince and the little
victim, the history of whose case she shared with the Prince, as
if she were watching Klaus Heinrich's sympathy, or were
trying to read in his face the effect of Dr. Sammet's words;
or maybe for some other reason.</p>

<p>Yes, this was especially noticeable in the case of the boy
with the bullet through his arm and the boy who had been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
picked out of the water&mdash;two sad cases, as Dr. Sammet remarked.
&ldquo;A severed artery, sister,&rdquo; he said, and showed them
the double wound in the boy's upper arm, the entry and exit
of the revolver bullet. &ldquo;The wound,&rdquo; said Doctor Sammet
in an undertone to his guests, turning his back to the bed,
&ldquo;the wound was caused by his own father. This one was the
lucky one. The man shot his wife, three of his children, and
himself with a revolver. He made a bad shot at this boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked at the double wound. &ldquo;What did
the man do it for?&rdquo; he asked hesitatingly, and Doctor Sammet
answered: &ldquo;In desperation, Royal Highness. It was shame
and want which brought him to it. Yes.&rdquo; He said no more,
just this commonplace&mdash;just as in the case of the boy, a
ten-year-old, who had been picked out of the water. &ldquo;He's
wheezing,&rdquo; said Doctor Sammet, &ldquo;he's still got some water in
his lung. He was picked out of the river early this morning&mdash;yes.
I may say that it is improbable that he <em>fell</em> into the
water. There are many indications to the contrary. He had
run away from home. Yes.&rdquo; He stopped.</p>

<p>And Klaus Heinrich again felt Miss Spoelmann looking
at him with her big, black, serious eyes&mdash;with her glance
which sought his own and seemed to challenge him insistently
to ponder with her the &ldquo;sad cases,&rdquo; to grasp the essential
meaning of Doctor Sammet's remarks, to penetrate to the
hideous truths which were incorporated and crystallized in
these two little invalid frames&hellip;. A little girl wept bitterly
when the steaming and hissing inhaler, together with a scrapbook
full of brightly coloured pictures, was planted at her
bedside.</p>

<p>Miss Spoelmann bent over the little one. &ldquo;It doesn't hurt,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;not a tiny bit. Don't cry.&rdquo; And as she straightened
herself again she added quickly, pursing up her lips, &ldquo;I guess
it's not so much the apparatus as the pictures she's crying
at.&rdquo; Everybody laughed. One of the young assistants picked
up the scrapbook and laughed still louder when he looked at
the pictures. The party passed on into the laboratory. Klaus
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
Heinrich thought, as he went, how dry Miss Spoelmann's
humour was. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she had said, and &ldquo;not so much.&rdquo;
She had seemed to find amusement not only in the pictures,
but also in the neat and incisive mode of expression she had
used. And that was indeed the very refinement of humour&hellip;.</p>

<p>The laboratory was the biggest room in the building.
Glasses, retorts, funnels, and chemicals stood on the tables,
as well as specimens in spirits which Doctor Sammet explained
to his guests in few quiet words. A child had choked in a
mysterious way: here was his larynx with mushroom-like
growths instead of the vocal chords. Yes. This, here in the
glass, was a case of pernicious enlargement of the kidney in a
child, and there were dislocated joints. Klaus Heinrich and
Miss Spoelmann looked at everything, they looked together
into the bottles which Doctor Sammet held up to the window,
and their eyes looked thoughtful while the same look of repulsion
hovered round their mouths.</p>

<p>They took turns too at the microscope, examined, with one
eye placed to the lens, a malignant secretion, a piece of blue-stained
tissue stuck on a slide, with tiny spots showing near
the big patch. The spots were bacilli. Klaus Heinrich
wanted Miss Spoelmann to take the first turn at the microscope,
but she declined, knitting her brows and pouting, as
much as to say: &ldquo;On no account whatever.&rdquo; So he took the
precedence, for it seemed to him that it really did not matter
who got the first look at such serious and fearful things as
bacilli. And after this they were conducted up to the second
story, to the infants.</p>

<p>They both laughed at the chorus of squalls which reached
their ears while they were still on the stairs. And then they
went with their party through the ward between the beds, bent,
side by side over the bald-headed little creatures, sleeping with
closed fists or screaming with all their might and showing their
naked gums&mdash;they stopped their ears and laughed again. In
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
a kind of oven, warmed to a moderate heat lay a new-born baby.</p>

<p>And Doctor Sammet showed his distinguished guests a
pauper baby with the grey look of a corpse and hideous big
hands, the sign of a miscarriage&hellip;. He lifted a squealing
baby out of its cot, and it at once stopped screaming. With
the touch of an expert he rested the limp head in the hollow
of his hand and showed the little red creature blinking and
twitching spasmodically to the two&mdash;Klaus Heinrich and Miss
Spoelmann, who stood side by side and looked down at the
infant. Klaus Heinrich stood watching with his heels together
as Doctor Sammet laid the baby back in its cot, and when he
turned round he met Miss Spoelmann's searching gaze, as
he had expected.</p>

<p>Finally they walked to one of the three windows of the
ward and looked out over the squalid suburb, down into the
street where, surrounded by children, the brown Court carriage
and Imma's smart dark-red motor car stood one behind
the other. The Spoelmanns' chauffeur, shapeless in his fur
coat, was leaning back in his seat with one hand on the
steering-wheel of the powerful car, and watched his companion,
the footman in white, trying to start a conversation, by the
carriage in front, with Klaus Heinrich's coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our neighbours,&rdquo; said Doctor Sammet, holding back the
white net curtain with one hand, &ldquo;are the parents of our
patients. Late in the evening the tipsy fathers roll shouting
by. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood and listened, but Doctor Sammet said nothing
further about the fathers and so they broke off, as they had
now seen everything.</p>

<p>The procession, with Klaus Heinrich and Imma at the head,
proceeded down the staircase and found the nurses again
assembled in the front hall. Leave was taken with compliments
and clapping together of heels, curtseys, and bows.
Klaus Heinrich, standing stiffly in front of Doctor Sammet,
who listened to him with his head on one side and his hand
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>
on his watch-chain, expressed himself, in his wonted form of
words, highly satisfied with what he had seen, while he felt
that Imma Spoelmann's great eyes were resting upon him.
He, with Herr von Braunbart, accompanied Miss Spoelmann to
her car when the leave-taking from the surgeons and nurses
was over. Klaus Heinrich and Miss Spoelmann, while they
crossed the pavement between children and women with
children in their arms, and for a short time by the broad step
of the motor car, exchanged the following remarks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a great pleasure to meet you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She answered nothing to this, but pouted and wagged her
head a little from side to side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an absorbing inspection,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;A regular
eye-opener.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with her big black eyes, then said quickly
and lightly in her broken voice: &ldquo;Yes, to a certain
extent&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ventured on the question: &ldquo;I hope you are pleased
with Schloss Delphinenort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which she answered with a pout: &ldquo;Oh, why not? It's
quite a convenient house&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like being there better than at New York?&rdquo; he
asked. And she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as much. It's much the same. Much the same everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all. Klaus Heinrich, and one pace behind him
Herr von Braunbart, stood with their hands to their helmets
as the chauffeur slipped his gear in and the motor car shivered
and started.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that this meeting did not long remain
the private property of the Dorothea Hospital; on the contrary,
it was the general topic of conversation before the
day was out. The <i>Courier</i> published, under a sentimental
poetical heading, a detailed description of the rencontre, which,
without too violent a departure from the exact truth, yet
succeeded in making such a powerful impression on the public
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>
mind, and evoked symptoms of such lively interest, that the
vigilant newspaper was induced to keep a watchful eye for
the future on any further rapprochements between the Spoelmann
and Grimmburg houses. It could not report much.</p>

<p>It remarked a couple of times that his Royal Highness
Prince Klaus Heinrich, when walking through the promenade
after a performance at the Court Theatre, had stopped for a
moment at the Spoelmanns' box to greet the ladies. And in
its report of the fancy-dress charity bazaar, which took place
in the middle of January in the Town Hall&mdash;a smart function,
in which Miss Spoelmann, at the urgent request of the Committee,
acted as seller&mdash;no small space was devoted to describing
how Prince Klaus Heinrich, when the Court was making
a round of the bazaar, had stopped before Miss Spoelmann's
stall, how he had bought a piece or two of fancy
glass (for Miss Spoelmann was selling porcelain and glass),
and had lingered a good eight or ten minutes at her stall.
It said nothing about the topic of the conversation. And yet
it had not been without importance.</p>

<p>The Court (with the exception of Albrecht) had appeared
in the Town Hall about noon. When Klaus Heinrich, with
his newly bought pieces of glass in tissue paper on his knee,
drove back to the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; he had announced his intention
of visiting Delphinenort and inspecting the Schloss in
its renovated state, on the same occasion viewing Mr. Spoelmann's
collection of glass. For three or four old pieces of
glass had been included in Miss Spoelmann's stock which her
father himself had given to the bazaar out of his collection,
and one of them Klaus Heinrich had bought.</p>

<p>He saw himself again in a semicircle of people, stared at,
alone, in front of Miss Spoelmann, and separated from her
by the stall-counter, with its vases, jugs, its white and coloured
groups of porcelain. He saw her in her red fancy dress,
which, made in one piece, clung close to her neat though
childish figure, while it exposed dark shoulders and arms,
which were round and firm and yet like those of a child
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>
just by the wrist. He saw the gold ornament, half garland
and half diadem, in the jet of her billowy hair, that showed
a tendency to fall in smooth wisps on her forehead, her big,
black, inquiring eyes in the pearly-white face, her full and
tender mouth, pouting with habitual scorn when she spoke&mdash;and
round about her in the great vaulted hall had been the
scent of firs and a babel of noise, music, the clash of gongs,
laughter, and the cries of sellers.</p>

<p>He had admired the piece of glass, the fine old beaker
with its ornament of silver foliage, which she proffered to
him, and she had said that it came from her father's collection.
&ldquo;Has your father, then, got many fine pieces like this?&rdquo;&mdash;Of
course. And presumably her father had not given the
best items to the bazaar. She could guarantee that he had
much finer pieces of glass. Klaus Heinrich would very
much like to see them! Well, that might easily be managed,
Miss Spoelmann had answered in her broken voice, while she
pouted and wagged her head slightly from side to side. Her
father, she meant, would certainly have no objection to showing
the fruits of his zeal as a collector to one more of a long
succession of intelligent visitors. The Spoelmanns were
always at home at tea-time.</p>

<p>She had gone straight to the point, taking the hint for
a definite offer, and speaking in an entirely off-hand way.
In conclusion, to Klaus Heinrich's question, what day would
suit best, she had answered: &ldquo;Whichever you like, Prince, we
shall be inexpressibly delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be inexpressibly delighted&rdquo;&mdash;those were her
words, so mocking and pointed in the exaggeration that they
almost hurt, and were difficult to listen to without wincing.
How she had rattled and hurt the poor sister in the Hospital
the other day! But all through there was something childish
in her manner of speech; indeed, some sounds she made were
just like those children make&mdash;not only on the occasion when
she was comforting the little girl about the inhaler. And
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
how large her eyes had seemed when they told her about the
children's fathers and the rest of the sad story!</p>

<p>Next day Klaus Heinrich went to tea at Schloss Delphinenort,
the very next. Miss Spoelmann had said he might come
when it suited him. But it suited him the very next day, and
as the matter seemed to him urgent, he saw no point in putting
it off.</p>

<p>Shortly before five o'clock&mdash;it was already dark&mdash;he drove
over the smooth roads of the Town Garden&mdash;bare and empty,
for this part of it belonged to Mr. Spoelmann. Arc-lamps lit
up the park, the big square spa-basin shimmered between the
trees; behind it rose the white Schloss with its pillared porch,
its spacious double staircase which led by gentle degrees
between the wings up to the first floor, its high leaded windows,
its Roman busts in the niches&mdash;and Klaus Heinrich, as
he drove along the approach avenue of mighty chestnuts, saw
the red-plush negro with his staff standing on guard at the
foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich crossed a brightly lighted stone hall, with
a floor of gilt mosaic and with white statues of gods round it,
passed straight over to the broad red-carpeted marble staircase,
down which the Spoelmanns' major-domo, clean shaven,
with shoulders squared and arms stiff, pot-bellied and haughty,
advanced to receive the guest. He escorted him up into the
tapestried and marble-chimneyed ante-room, where a couple
of white-and-gold swan's-down footmen took the Prince's cap
and cloak, while the steward went in person to announce him
to his master&hellip;. The footman held aside one of the tapestries
for Klaus Heinrich, who descended two or three steps.</p>

<p>The scent of flowers met him, and he heard the soft splash
of falling water; but just as the tapestry closed behind him,
so wild and harsh a barking was heard that Klaus Heinrich,
half deafened for a moment, stopped at the foot of the steps.
Percival, the collie, had dashed at him in a fury. He pranced,
he capered in uncontrollable passion, he pirouetted, beat his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>
sides with his tail, planted his forefeet on the floor, and
turned wildly round and round, and seemed like to burst with
noise. A voice&mdash;not Imma's&mdash;called him off, and Klaus Heinrich
found himself in a winter garden, a glass conservatory
with white marble columns and a floor of big square marble
flags. Palms of all kinds filled it, whose trunks and tops
often reached close up to the glass ceiling. A flower-bed,
consisting of countless pots arranged like the stones of a
mosaic, lay in the strong moonlight of the arc-lamp and
filled the air with its scent. Out of a beautifully carved
fountain, silver streams flowed into a marble pool, and ducks
with strange and fantastic plumage swam about on the illuminated
water. The background was filled by a stone walk
with columns and niches.</p>

<p>It was Countess Löwenjoul who advanced towards the guest,
and curtseyed with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness will not mind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;our Percy
is so uproarious. Besides, he's so unaccustomed to visitors.
But he never touches anybody. Your Royal Highness must
excuse Miss Spoelmann&hellip;. She'll be back soon. She was
here just now. She was called away, her father sent for her.
Mr. Spoelmann will be delighted&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she conducted Klaus Heinrich to an arrangement of
basket chairs with embroidered linen cushions which stood
in front of a group of palms. She spoke in a brisk and
emphatic tone, with her little head with its thin iron-grey
hair bent on one side and her white teeth showing as she
laughed. Her figure was distinctly graceful in the close-fitting
brown dress she was wearing, and she moved as
freshly and elegantly as an officer's wife. Only in her eyes,
whose lids she kept blinking, there was something of mistrust
or spite, something unintelligible. They sat down facing
each other at the round garden-table, on which lay a
few books. Percival, exhausted by his outburst, curled himself
up on the narrow pearl-grey carpet on which the furniture
stood. His black coat was like silk, with white paws,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>
chest, and muzzle. He had a white collar, yellow eyes, and a
parting along his back. Klaus Heinrich began a conversation
for conversation's sake, a formal dialogue about nothing in
particular, which was all he could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Countess, that I have not come at an inconvenient
time. Luckily I need not feel myself an unauthorized intruder.
I do not know whether Miss Spoelmann has told
you&hellip;. She was so kind as to suggest my calling. It was
about those lovely pieces of glass which Mr. Spoelmann so
generously gave to yesterday's bazaar. Miss Spoelmann
thought that her father would have no objection to letting
me see the rest of his collection. That's why I'm here&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess ignored the question whether Imma had told
her of the arrangement. She said: &ldquo;This is tea-time, Royal
Highness. Of course your visit is not inconvenient. Even
if, as I hope will not be the case, Mr. Spoelmann were too
unwell to appear&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is he ill?&rdquo; In reality Klaus Heinrich wished just a
little that Mr. Spoelmann might be too unwell. He anticipated
his meeting with him with vague anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was feeling ill to-day, Royal Highness. He had a
touch of fever, shivering, and a little faintness. Dr. Watercloose
was with him for a long time this morning. He was
given an injection of morphia. There's some question of an
operation being necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich quite honestly. &ldquo;An
operation? How dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which the Countess answered, letting her eyes wander:
&ldquo;Oh yes. But there are worse things in life&mdash;many much
worse things than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I can quite believe
it.&rdquo; He felt his imagination stirred in a vague and general way
by the Countess's allusion.</p>

<p>She looked at him with her head inclined to one side, and
an expression of contempt on her face. Then her slightly
distended grey eyes shifted, while she smiled the mysterious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
smile which Klaus Heinrich already knew and which had
something seductive about it.</p>

<p>He felt it was necessary to resume the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lived long with the Spoelmanns, Countess?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fairly long time,&rdquo; she answered, and appeared to calculate.
&ldquo;Fairly long. I have lived through so much, have
had so many experiences, that I naturally cannot reckon to
a day. But it was shortly after the blessing&mdash;soon after the
blessing was vouchsafed to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blessing?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said decidedly with some agitation. &ldquo;For
the blessing happened to me when the number of my experiences
had become too great, and the bow had reached
breaking point, to use a metaphor. You are so young,&rdquo; she
continued, forgetting to address him by his title, &ldquo;so ignorant
of all that makes the world so miserable and so depraved,
that you can form no conception of what I have had to suffer.
I brought an action in America which involved the appearance
of several generals. Things came to light which were more
than my temper could stand. I had to clear out several barracks
without succeeding in bringing to light every loose
woman. They hid themselves in the cupboards, some even
under the floors, and that's why they continue torturing me
beyond measure at nights. I should at once go back to my
Schloss in Burgundy if the rain did not come through the
roofs. The Spoelmanns knew that, and that is why it was so
obliging of them to let me live with them indefinitely, my
only duty being to put the innocent Imma on her guard against
the world. Only of course my health suffers from my having
the women sitting at nights on my chest and forcing me to
look at their disgusting faces. And that is why I ask you
to call me simply Frau Meier,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, leaning
forward and touching Klaus Heinrich's arm with her hand.
&ldquo;The walls have ears, and it is absolutely necessary for me
to keep up the incognito I was forced to assume in order to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>
protect myself against the persecution of the odious creatures.
You will do what I ask, will you not? Look on it as a joke
&hellip; a fad which hurts nobody&hellip;. Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich sat upright and braced up in his wicker
chair opposite her and looked at her. Before leaving his
rectilineal room, he had dressed himself with his valet Neumann's
help with all possible care, as his life in the public
eye required. His parting ran from over his left eye, straight
up to the crown of his head, without a hair sticking up, and
his hair was brushed up into a crest off the right side of his
forehead. There he sat in his undress uniform, whose high
collar and close fit helped him to maintain a composed attitude,
the silver epaulettes of a major on his narrow shoulders, leaning
slightly but not comfortably forward, collected, calm, with
one foot slightly advanced, and with his right hand above his
left on his sword-hilt. His young face looked slightly weary
from the unreality, the loneliness, strictness, and difficulty of
his life; he sat looking at the Countess with a friendly, clear,
but composed expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>She stopped. Disenchantment and disgust showed themselves
in her features, and, while something like hate towards
Klaus Heinrich flamed up in her tired grey eyes, she blushed
in the strangest of ways, for one half of her face turned red,
the other white. Dropping her eyelids she answered: &ldquo;I
have been living with the Spoelmanns for three years, Royal
Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Percival darted forward. Dancing, springing, and wagging
his tail he trotted towards his mistress&mdash;for Imma Spoelmann
had come in&mdash;raised himself in a dignified way on his hind
legs and laid his fore paws in greeting on her breast. His
jaws were wide open, and his red tongue hung out between his
ivory-white teeth. He looked like a heraldic supporter as he
stood there before her.</p>

<p>She wore a wonderful dress of brick-red silk with loose
hanging sleeves, and the breast covered with heavy gold embroidery.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>
A big egg-shaped jewel on a pearl necklace lay
on her bare neck, the skin of which was the colour of smoked
meerschaum. Her blue-black hair was parted on one side
and coiled, though a few smooth wisps tended to fall on her
forehead. Holding Percival's head in her two narrow, ringless
little hands, she looked into his face, saying, &ldquo;Well, well,
my friend. What a welcome! We are glad to see each other&mdash;we
hated being parted, didn't we? Now go back and lie
down.&rdquo; And she put his paws off the gold embroidery on
her breast, and set him on his four paws again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Prince,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Welcome to Delphinenort. You
hate breaking your promise, I can see. I'm coming to sit
next you. They'll tell us when tea is ready&hellip;. It's against
all the rules, I know, for me to have kept you waiting.
But my father sent for me&mdash;and besides you had somebody
to entertain you.&rdquo; Her bright eyes passed from Klaus Heinrich
to the Countess and back in a rather hesitating way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's quite true,&rdquo; he said. And then he asked how Mr.
Spoelmann was, and received a fairly reassuring answer. Mr.
Spoelmann would have the pleasure of making Klaus Heinrich's
acquaintance at tea-time, he begged to be excused till
then&hellip;. What a lovely pair of horses Klaus Heinrich had
in his brougham! And then they talked about their horses,
about Klaus Heinrich's good-tempered brown Florian from
the Hollerbrunn stud, about Miss Spoelmann's Arabian cream,
the mare Fatma which had been given to Mr. Spoelmann by
an oriental prince, about her fast Hungarian chestnuts, which
she drove four-in-hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the country round?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich.
&ldquo;Have you hunted with the Royal pack? Have you been to
the &lsquo;Pheasantry&rsquo;? There are lots of lovely excursions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, Miss Spoelmann was not at all clever in finding out
new roads, and the Countess&mdash;well, her whole nature was
unenterprising, so they always chose the same road, in the
Town Gardens, for their ride. It was boring, perhaps, but
Miss Spoelmann was not on the whole so blasé as to need
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
constant change and adventures. Then he said that they must
go together some time to a meet of the hounds or to the
&ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo; whereupon she pursed her lips and said that
that was an idea which might be discussed some time in the
future. Then the major-domo came in and gravely announced
that tea was ready.</p>

<p>They went through the tapestry hall with the marble fireplace,
conducted by the strutting butler, accompanied by the
dancing Percy, and followed by Countess Löwenjoul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the Countess been letting her tongue run away with
her?&rdquo; asked Imma <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>, without any particular lowering
of her voice.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich started and looked at the floor. &ldquo;But she
can hear us!&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn't hear us,&rdquo; answered Imma. &ldquo;I can read
her face. When she holds her head crooked like that and
blinks her eyes it means that she is wandering and deep in
her thoughts. Did she let her tongue run away with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a minute or two,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I got the
impression that the Countess &lsquo;let herself go&rsquo; every now and
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has had a lot of trouble.&rdquo; And Imma looked at
him with the same big searching dark eyes with which she
had scanned him in the Dorothea Hospital. &ldquo;I'll tell you
all about it another time. It's a long story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some other time. Next time. On our
ride perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On our ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on our ride to the meet, or to the &lsquo;Pheasantry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot your preciseness, Prince, in the matter of
appointments. Very well, on our ride. We go down here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found themselves at the back of the Schloss. Carpeted
steps led from a gallery hung with big pictures, down
into the white-and-gold garden room, behind the glass door
of which lay the terrace. Everything&mdash;the big crystal lustres,
which hung from the centre of the high, white-festooned
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>
ceiling, the regularly arranged arm-chairs with gilt frames
and fancy upholstering, the heavy white silk curtains, the
elaborate clock and the vases and gilt lamps on the white
marble chimneypiece in front of the tall looking-glass, the
massive, lion-footed gilt candelabra which towered on either
side of the entrance&mdash;everything reminded Klaus Heinrich of
the Old Schloss, of the Representation Chamber, in which he
had played his part from his youth up; only that the candles
here were shams, with yellow electric bulbs instead of wicks,
and that everything of the Spoelmanns' was new and smart
in Schloss Delphinenort. A swan's-down footman was putting
the last touch to the tea-table in a corner of the room; Klaus
Heinrich noticed the electric kettle about which he had read in
the <i>Courier</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Spoelmann been told?&rdquo; asked the daughter of
the house&hellip;. The butler bowed. &ldquo;Then there's nothing,&rdquo;
she said quickly and half mockingly, &ldquo;to prevent us from
taking our places and beginning without him. Come, Countess!
I advise you, Prince, to unbuckle your sword, unless
there are reasons unknown to me for your not doing so&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;no, there is no reason why
I shouldn't.&rdquo; And he was angry with himself for not being
smart enough to think of a more adroit answer.</p>

<p>The footman took his sword, and carried it off. They took
their seats at the tea-table with the help of the butler, who
held the backs and pushed the chairs under them. Then he
retired to the top of the steps, where he remained in an elegant
attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, Prince,&rdquo; said Miss Spoelmann, pouring the
water into the pot, &ldquo;that my father won't drink any tea which
I have not made with my own hands. He distrusts all tea
which is handed round ready-made in cups. That is barred
with us. You'll have to put up with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I like it much better like this,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich,
&ldquo;it's much more comfortable and free-and-easy at a family
tea like this&hellip;.&rdquo; He broke off, and wondered why as he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
spoke these words a side-glance of hatred lighted on him from
the eyes of Countess Löwenjoul. &ldquo;And your course of study?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;May I ask about it? It's mathematics, I know.
Don't you find it too much? Isn't it terribly brain-racking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's just splendid; it's like
playing in the breezes, so to speak, or rather out of the
breezes, in a dust-free atmosphere. It's as cool there as in
the Adirondacks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Adirondacks. That's geography, Prince. Mountains
over in the States, with lovely snowfields. We have a country
cottage there, where we go in May. In summer we used to go
to the sea-side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can testify to your zeal in your
studies. You do not like being prevented from arriving punctually
at your lectures. I haven't yet asked you whether
you reached that one the other day up to time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a week or two ago. After the contretemps with the
change of guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, Prince, now you are beginning that too.
That story seems to have reached from hut to palace. Had
I known what a bother was going to come of it, I would
rather have gone three times round the whole Schlossplatz.
It even got into the newspapers, I'm told. And now of course
the whole town thinks I am a regular fiend for temper and
rudeness. But I am the most peaceful creature in the world,
and only don't like being ordered about. Am I a fiend,
Countess? I demand a truthful answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you're an angel,&rdquo; said Countess Löwenjoul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm&mdash;angel, that's too much, that's too far the other way,
Countess&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;no, not too far. I entirely
believe the Countess&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm much honoured. But how did your Highness hear
about the adventure? Through the newspapers?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>&ldquo;I was an eye-witness of it,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An eye-witness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I happened to be standing at the window of the
officers' mess, and saw the whole thing from beginning to
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Spoelmann blushed. There was no doubt about it,
the pale skin of her face deepened in colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Prince,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I assume that you had nothing
better to do at the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But it was a splendid sight. I give
you my word that never in my life&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Percival, who was lying with his forepaws crossed, by
Miss Spoelmann, raised his head with a look of tense expectancy
and beat the carpet with his <ins title="tail,">tail.</ins> At the same moment
the butler began to run, as fast as his ponderous frame would
let him, down the steps to the lofty side-door over against the
tea-table, and swiftly pulled aside the whole silk portière,
sticking his double chin the while into the air with a majestic
expression. Samuel Spoelmann, the millionaire, walked in.</p>

<p>He was a man of neat build with a strange face. He was
clean shaven, with red cheeks and a prominent nose, his little
eyes were of a metallic blue-black, like those of little children
and animals, and had an absent and peevish look. The upper
part of his head was bald, but behind and on his temples
Mr. Spoelmann had a quantity of grey hair, dressed in a fashion
not often seen among us. He wore it neither short nor
long, but brushed up, sticking out, though cropped on the
nape and round his ears. His mouth was small and finely
chiselled. Dressed in a black frock-coat with a velvet waistcoat
on which lay a long, thin, old-fashioned watch-chain, and
soft slippers on his feet, he advanced quickly to the tea-table
with a cross and pre-occupied expression on his face; but his
face cleared up, it regained composure and tenderness when he
caught sight of his daughter. Imma had gone to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greeting, most excellent father,&rdquo; she said, and throwing
her brown little arms, in their loose brick-coloured hanging
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
sleeves, round his neck, she kissed him on the bald spot which
he offered her as he inclined his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you knew,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that Prince Klaus
Heinrich was coming to tea with us to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I'm delighted, delighted,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann no
less readily and in a grating voice. &ldquo;Please don't move!&rdquo;
he said at once. And while he shook hands (Mr. Spoelmann's
hand was thin and half-covered by his unstarched white cuff)
with the Prince, who was standing modestly by the table, he
nodded repeatedly to one side or the other. That was his
way of greeting Klaus Heinrich. He was an alien, an invalid,
and a man apart as regards wealth. He was forgiven and
nothing further was expected of him&mdash;Klaus Heinrich recognized
the fact, and took pains to recover his self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are at home here in a sense,&rdquo; added Mr. Spoelmann,
cutting the conversation short, and a passing gleam of malice
played round his clean-shaven mouth. Then he gave the
others an example by sitting down. It was the chair between
Imma and Klaus Heinrich, opposite the Countess and the
veranda door, which the butler pushed under him.</p>

<p>As Mr. Spoelmann showed no intention of apologizing
for his unpunctuality, Klaus Heinrich said: &ldquo;I am sorry
to hear that you are unwell this morning, Mr. Spoelmann. I
hope you are better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, better, not but all right,&rdquo; answered Mr. Spoelmann
crossly. &ldquo;How many spoonfuls did you put in?&rdquo; he asked
his daughter. He was alluding to the tea.</p>

<p>She had filled his cup, and she handed it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;One for each person. Nobody shall
say that I stint my grey-haired father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; answered Mr. Spoelmann. &ldquo;I'm not grey-haired.
You ought to have your tongue clipped.&rdquo; And he
took from a silver box a kind of rusk which seemed to be his
own special dainty, broke it and dipped it peevishly in the
golden tea, which he, like his daughter, drank without milk
or sugar.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>Klaus Heinrich began over again: &ldquo;I am much excited
at the prospect of seeing your collection, Mr. Spoelmann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Mr. Spoelmann. &ldquo;So you want to
see my glass? Are you an amateur? A collector perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;my love for glass has not extended
to my becoming a collector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No time?&rdquo; asked Mr. Spoelmann. &ldquo;Do your military
duties take so much time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich answered: &ldquo;I'm no longer on the active
list, Mr. Spoelmann. I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la suite</i> of my regiment. I wear
the uniform, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, make believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann harshly. &ldquo;What
do you do all day, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich had stopped drinking tea, had pushed his
things away in the course of the conversation which demanded
his undivided attention. He sat upright and defended himself,
feeling the while that Imma Spoelmann's big, black, searching
eyes were resting on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have duties at Court, with the ceremonies and big occasions.
I have also to represent the State in a military capacity,
at the swearing-in of recruits and the presentation of
colours. Then I have to hold levées as deputy for my brother,
the Grand Duke. And then there are little journeys on duty
to the provincial centres for unveilings and dedications and
other public solemnities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann. &ldquo;Ceremonies, solemnities,
food for spectators. No, that sort of thing's beyond me. I
tell you once for all, that I wouldn't give a farthing for your
calling. That's my standpoint, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I entirely understand,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. He sat up
stiffly in his uniform and smiled uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it needs practice like everything else,&rdquo; Mr. Spoelmann
went on in a little less bitter tone of voice&mdash;&ldquo;practice
and training, I can see. For myself I shall never as long as
I live cease feeling angry when I am obliged to play the prodigy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;that our people are
not wanting in respect&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, not so bad,&rdquo; answered Mr. Spoelmann. &ldquo;The people
are at least friendly here; one doesn't see murder written
in their eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Mr. Spoelmann,&rdquo; and Klaus Heinrich felt more
at his ease, now that the conversation had turned, and the
questioning lay with him, &ldquo;that, notwithstanding the unusual
circumstances, you continue to enjoy your stay amongst us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann, &ldquo;I'm quite comfortable,
and the water is the only thing which really does do me
some good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not find it a wrench to leave America?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich felt a look, a quick, suspicious, shy look,
which he could not interpret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann, sharply and crossly. That was
all his answer to the question whether he felt it a wrench
to leave America.</p>

<p>A pause ensued. Countess Löwenjoul held her smooth
little head inclined to one side, and smiled a distant Madonna-like
smile. Miss Spoelmann watched Klaus Heinrich fixedly
with her big black eyes, as if testing the effect of her
father's extraordinary boorishness on the guest,&mdash;indeed,
Klaus Heinrich felt that she was waiting with resignation and
sympathy for him to get up and take his departure for good
and all. He met her eyes, and remained. Mr. Spoelmann,
for his part, drew out a gold case and took out a fat
cigarette, which, when lighted, diffused a delicious fragrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; he asked&hellip;. And as Klaus Heinrich found
that there was no objection, he helped himself, after Mr.
Spoelmann, out of the proffered case.</p>

<p>They then discussed various topics before proceeding to
an inspection of the glass&mdash;chiefly Klaus Heinrich and Miss
Spoelmann, for the Countess's thoughts were wandering, and
Mr. Spoelmann only interpolated a cross remark now and
then: the local theatre, the huge ship in which the Spoelmanns
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
had crossed to Europe. No, they had not used their
yacht for the purpose. Its primary object was to take Mr.
Spoelmann to sea in the evening in the heat of summer,
when he was tied to his business and Imma and the Countess
were in Newport; he used to pass the night on deck. She was
now lying at Venice. But they had crossed in a huge steamer,
a floating hotel with concert rooms and gymnasia. &ldquo;She had
five storeys,&rdquo; said Miss Spoelmann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Counting from below?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich. And she
answered at once:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Six, counting from above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got muddled and lost his bearings and it was a long
time before he realized that she was making fun of him.
Then he tried to explain himself and to make his simple
question clear, explaining that he meant to ask whether she
included the under-water holds, the cellars so to speak, in
the five&mdash;in short, to prove that he was not lacking in common
sense, and at last he joined heartily in the merriment
which was the result of his efforts. As for the Court Theatre,
Miss Spoelmann gave it as her opinion, with a pout and a wag
of the head, that the actress who played the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénue</i> should
be strongly recommended to go through the cure at Marienbad,
coupled with a course of lessons in dancing and deportment,
while the hero should be warned that a voice as resonant as
his should be used most sparingly, even in private life&hellip;.
All the same, Miss Spoelmann expressed her warm admiration
for the theatre in question.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich laughed and wondered, a little oppressed
by so much smartness. How well she spoke, how pointed
and incisive were her words! They discussed the operas also
and the plays which had been produced during the winter,
and Imma Spoelmann contradicted Klaus Heinrich's judgments,
contradicted him in every case, just as if she thought
that not to contradict would show a mean spirit; the superior
wit of her tongue left him dazed, and the great black eyes
in her pearl-white face glittered from sheer joy in her dialectic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
skill, while Mr. Spoelmann leaned back in his chair,
holding the fat cigarette between his lips and blinking through
its smoke, and gazed at his daughter with fond satisfaction.</p>

<p>More than once Klaus Heinrich showed in his face the look
of pained bewilderment which he had noticed on a previous
occasion on the face of the good sister, and yet he felt convinced
that it was not Imma Spoelmann's intention to wound
his feelings, that she did not consider him humbled because
he was not successful in standing up to her, that she rather
let his poor answers pass, as if she considered that he had
no need of a sharp wit to defend him&mdash;it was only she who
had. But how was that, and why? He thought involuntarily
of Ueberbein at many of her sallies, of the nimble-tongued
blusterer Ueberbein, who was a natural misfortune, and had
grown up in conditions which he described as favourable. A
youth of misery, loneliness, and misfortune, shut out from
the blessings of fortune&mdash;such a man knew no luxury, no
comfort, he saw himself clearly and cruelly thrown on his
own resources, which assuredly gave him an advantage over
those who &ldquo;knew not necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Imma Spoelmann sat there in her red-gold dress at
the table, reclining indolently, with the mocking look of
a spoiled child; there she sat in confident ease, while her
tongue ran on sharply and freely, as befitted an atmosphere
of refinement and lively wit. But why did she give it play?
Klaus Heinrich pondered the question, the while they discussed
Atlantic steamers and plays. He sat bolt upright at the table,
in a dignified and uncomfortable attitude, while he concealed
his left hand, and more than once he felt a sidelong glance of
hatred from the eyes of Countess Löwenjoul.</p>

<p>A servant came in and handed Mr. Spoelmann a telegram
on a silver salver. Mr. Spoelmann tore it open crossly,
glanced through it, blinking and with the remains of his
cigarette in the corner of his mouth, and threw it back on
the salver, with the curt order: &ldquo;Mr. Phlebs.&rdquo; Thereupon
he lighted a new cigarette.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>Miss Spoelmann said: &ldquo;In spite of distinct medical orders,
that's the fifth cigarette you've had to-day. Let me tell you
that the unbridled passion with which you abandon yourself
to the vice little beseems your grey hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Spoelmann obviously tried to laugh, and as obviously
failed; the acid tone of his daughter's words was not to his
liking, and he flushed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You think you can say anything
in fun, but please spare me your saucy jokes, chatterbox!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich, appalled, looked at Imma, who turned her
big eyes on her father's angry face, and then sadly dropped
her head. Of course she had not meant any offence, she had
simply amused herself with the strange, swelling words which
she used to poke her fun; she had expected to raise a laugh,
and had failed dismally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, darling father!&rdquo; she said beseechingly, and crossed
over to stroke Mr. Spoelmann's flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he grumbled on, &ldquo;you've grown out of that sort
of thing by now.&rdquo; But then he yielded to her blandishments,
let her kiss the top of his head, and swallowed his
anger. Klaus Heinrich, when peace was restored, alluded to
the collection of glass, whereupon the party left the tea-table
and went into the adjoining museum, with the exception of
Countess Löwenjoul, who withdrew with a deep curtsey. Mr.
Spoelmann himself switched on the electric light in the
chandeliers.</p>

<p>Handsome cabinets in the style of the whole Schloss, with
swelling curves and rounded glass doors, alternated with rich
silk chairs all round the room. In these cabinets Mr. Spoelmann's
collection of glass was displayed. Yes, there could
be no doubt that it was the most complete collection in either
hemisphere, and the glass which Klaus Heinrich had acquired
was merely a most modest sample of it. It began in
one corner of the room with the earliest artistic productions
of the industry, with finds of heathenish designs from the
culture of the earliest times; then came the products of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>
East and West of every epoch; next, wreathed, flourished, and
imposing vases and beakers from Venetian blow-pipes and
costly pieces from Bohemian huts, German tankards, picturesque
Guild and Electorate bowls, mixed with grotesque
animals and comic figures, huge crystal cups, which reminded
one of the Luck of Edenhall in the song, and in whose facets
the light broke and sparkled; ruby-coloured glasses like the
Holy Grail; and finally the best samples of the latest development
of the art, fragile blossoms on impossibly brittle stems,
and fancy glasses in the latest fashionable shape, made iridescent
with the vapours of precious metals. The three, followed
by Percival, who also examined the collection, walked slowly
round the hall; and Mr. Spoelmann related in his harsh voice
the origin of particular pieces, taking them carefully off their
velvet stands with his thin, soft-cuffed hand, and holding
them up to the electric light.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich had had plenty of practice in visits of inspection,
in putting questions and making adroit remarks,
so that he was well able at the same time to ponder over
Imma Spoelmann's mode of expressing herself, that peculiar
mode which worried him not a little. What amazing freedom
she allowed herself! What extraordinary remarks she
allowed herself to make! &ldquo;Passion,&rdquo; &ldquo;vice,&rdquo; where did she
get the words from? where did she learn to use them so
glibly? Had not Countess Löwenjoul, who herself dealt with
the same topics in a confused sort of way, and had obviously
seen the seamy side of life, described her as quite innocent!</p>

<p>And the description was undoubtedly correct, for was she
not an exception by birth like himself, brought up like a
girl &ldquo;born to be queen,&rdquo; kept apart from the busy strife of
men and from all the turmoil to which those sinister words
corresponded in the life of reality? But she had uttered the
words glibly, and had treated them as a joke. Yes, that was
it, this dainty creature in her red-gold gown was merely a
wielder of words; she knew no more of life than those words,
she played with the most serious and most awful of them as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>
with coloured stones, and was puzzled when she made people
angry by their use. Klaus Heinrich's heart, as he thought
of this, filled with sympathy.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o'clock when he asked for his carriage
to be called&mdash;slightly uneasy about his long stay, in
view of the Court and the public. His departure evoked a
fresh and terrifying demonstration on the part of Percival,
the collie. Every alteration or interruption in a situation
seemed to throw the noble animal off his moral balance.
Quivering, yelping, and deaf to all blandishments, he stormed
through the rooms and the hall and up and down the steps,
drowning the words of leave-taking in his hubbub. The butler
did the Prince the honours as far as the floor with the
statues of gods. Mr. Spoelmann did not accompany him
any distance. Miss Spoelmann made the position clear: &ldquo;I
am convinced that your sojourn in the bosom of our family
has charmed you, Prince.&rdquo; And he was left wondering
whether the joke lay in the expression &ldquo;the bosom of our
family&rdquo; or in the actual fact. Anyhow, Klaus Heinrich was
at a loss for a reply.</p>

<p>Leaning back in the corner of his brougham, rather sore
and battered, and yet stimulated by the unusual treatment he
had experienced, he drove home, through the dark Town
Gardens to the Hermitage, returned to his sober Empire room,
where he dined with von Schulenburg-Tressen and Braunbart-Schellendorf.
Next day he read the comments of the <i>Courier</i>.
They amounted only to a statement that yesterday his Royal
Highness Prince Klaus Heinrich went to Schloss Delphinenort
for tea, and inspected Mr. Spoelmann's renowned collection
of fancy glass.</p>

<p>And Klaus Heinrich continued to live his unreal life, and
to carry out his exalted calling. He uttered his gracious
speeches, made his gestures, represented his people at the
Court and at the President of the Council's great ball, gave
free audiences, lunched in the officers' mess of the Grenadier
Guards, showed himself at the Court Theatre, and bestowed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
on this and that district of the country the privilege of his
presence. With a smile, and with heels together, he carried
out all due formalities and did his irksome duty with complete
self-possession, albeit he had at this time so much to
think of&mdash;about the peppery Mr. Spoelmann, the muddle-headed
Countess Löwenjoul, the harum-scarum Percy, and
especially about Imma, the daughter of the house. Many a
question to which his first visit to Delphinenort had given rise
he was not yet in a position to answer, but only succeeded in
solving as the result of further intercourse with the Spoelmanns,
which he maintained to the eager and at last feverish
interest of the public, and which advanced a step further
when the Prince in the early morning one day, to the astonishment
of his suite, his servants, and himself&mdash;indeed, partly
involuntarily, and as if carried along by destiny&mdash;appeared
alone and on horseback at Delphinenort, for the purpose of
taking Miss Spoelmann, whom he disturbed in her mathematical
studies at the top of the Schloss, for a ride.</p>

<p>The grip of winter had relaxed early in this ever-to-be-remembered
year. After a mild January, the middle of
February had seen the coming of a preliminary spring with
birds and sunshine and balmy breezes, and as Klaus Heinrich
lay on the first of these mornings at the Hermitage in his
roomy old mahogany bed, from one of whose posts the
spherical crown was missing, he felt himself, as it were, impelled
by a strange hand and irresistibly inspired to deeds of
boldness.</p>

<p>He rang the bell-pull for Neumann (they only had draw-bells
at the Hermitage), and ordered Florian to be ready
saddled in an hour's time. Should a horse be got ready for
the groom too? No, it was not necessary. Klaus Heinrich
said that he wanted to ride alone. Then he gave himself
into Neumann's skilful hands for his morning toilette, breakfasted
impatiently below in the garden room, and mounted
his horse at the foot of the terrace. With his spurred top-boots
in the stirrups, the yellow reins in his brown-gloved
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>
right hand, and the left planted on his hip under his open
cloak, he rode at a walking pace through the soft morning,
scanning the still bare branches for the birds whose twittering
he heard. He rode through the public part of his park,
through the Town Gardens and the grounds of Delphinenort.
He reached it at half-past nine. Great was the general surprise.</p>

<p>At the main gate he gave Florian over to an English groom.
The butler, who was crossing the mosaic hall busy on his
household duties, stood still, taken aback at the sight of Klaus
Heinrich. To the inquiry which the Prince addressed to him,
in a clear and almost haughty voice, about the ladies, he
did not even reply, but turned helplessly towards the marble
staircase, gazing dumbly at the top step, for there stood Mr.
Spoelmann.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had just finished breakfast, and was in
the best of tempers. His hands were plunged deep in his
pockets, his lounge coat drawn back from his velvet waistcoat,
and the blue smoke of his cigarette was making him
blink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young Prince?&rdquo; he said, and stared down at
him&hellip;.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich saluted and hurried up the red stair-carpet.
He felt that the situation could only be saved by swiftness
and, so to speak, by an attack by storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be astounded, Mr. Spoelmann,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at
this early hour&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; He was out of breath, and the fact
disturbed him greatly, he was so little used to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Spoelmann answered him by a look and a shrug of
the shoulders, as much as to say that he could control himself,
but desired an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, we have an appointment&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; said Klaus
Heinrich. He was standing two steps below the millionaire
and was speaking up at him. &ldquo;An appointment for a ride
between Miss Imma and myself&hellip;. I have promised to
show the ladies the &lsquo;Pheasantry&rsquo; and the Court Kennels&hellip;.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>
Miss Imma told me that she knew nothing about the surrounding
country. It was agreed that on the first fine
day&nbsp;&hellip; It's such a lovely day to-day&hellip;. It is of course
subject to your approval&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Spoelmann shrugged his shoulders, and made a face
as if to say: &ldquo;Approval&mdash;why so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter is grown up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't interfere.
If she rides, she rides. But I don't think she has time. You
must find that out for yourself. She's in there.&rdquo; And Mr.
Spoelmann pointed his chin towards the tapestry door,
through which Klaus Heinrich had already once passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I'll go and see for myself.&rdquo;
And he ran up the remaining steps, pushed the tapestry
hanging aside with a determined gesture, and went down the
steps into the sunlit, flower-scented winter garden.</p>

<p>In front of the splashing fountain and the basin with
fancy-feathered ducks sat Imma Spoelmann leaning over a
table, her back turned to the incomer. Her hair was down.
It hung black and glossy on each side of her head, covered
her shoulders, and allowed nothing to be seen but a shadow
of the childlike quarter profile of her face, which showed
white as ivory against the darkness of her hair. There she
sat absorbed in her studies, working at the figures in the notebook
before her, her lips pressed on the back of her left
hand, and her right grasping the pen.</p>

<p>The Countess too was there, also busy writing. She sat
some way off under the palms, where Klaus Heinrich had
first conversed with her, and wrote sitting upright with her
head on one side, a pile of closely scribbled note-paper lying
at her side. The clank of Klaus Heinrich's spurs made her
look up. She looked at him with half-closed eyes for two
seconds, the long pen poised in her hand, then rose and
curtseyed. &ldquo;Imma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;his Royal Highness Prince
Klaus Heinrich is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Spoelmann turned quickly round in her basket chair,
shook her hair back and gazed without speaking at the intruder
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>
with big, startled eyes, until Klaus Heinrich had bid the
ladies good-morning with a military salute. Then she said in
her broken voice: &ldquo;Good-morning to you too, Prince. But
you are too late for breakfast. We've finished long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's lucky,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that both parties have had breakfast,
for now we can start at once for a ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, as we agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agreed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don't say that you've forgotten!&rdquo; he said pleadingly.
&ldquo;Didn't I promise to show you the country round? Weren't
we going for a ride together when it was fine? Well, to-day
it's glorious. Just look out&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not a bad day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you go too fast,
Prince. I remember that there was some suggestion of a
ride at some future time&mdash;but surely not so soon as this?
Might I not at least have expected some sort of notification,
if your Highness will allow the word? You must allow that
I can't ride like this about here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she stood up to show her morning dress, which consisted
of a loose gown of many-coloured silk and an open
green-velvet jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unfortunately you cannot. But I'll wait
here while you both change. It's quite early&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncommonly early. But in the second place I am rather
busy with my innocent studies, as you saw. I've got a lecture
at eleven o'clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to-day you must not grind at algebra,
Miss Imma; you must not play in the vacuum, as you put it!
Look at the sun!&hellip; May I?&hellip;&rdquo; And he went to the
table and took up the notebook.</p>

<p>What he saw made his head swim. A fantastic hocus-pocus,
a witches' sabbath of abbreviated symbols, written in
a childish round hand which was the obvious result of Miss
Spoelmann's peculiar way of holding her pen, covered the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" title="225"> </a>
pages. There were Greek and Latin letters of various heights,
crossed and cancelled, arranged above and below cross lines,
covered by other lines, enclosed in round brackets, formulated
in square brackets. Single letters, pushed forward like
sentries, kept guard above the main bodies. Cabalistic signs,
quite unintelligible to the lay mind, cast their arms round
letters and ciphers, while fractions stood in front of them and
ciphers and letters hovered round their tops and bottoms.
Strange syllables, abbreviations of mysterious words, were
scattered everywhere, and between the columns were written
sentences and remarks in ordinary language, whose sense was
equally beyond the normal intelligence, and conveyed no
more to the reader than an incantation.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked at the slight form, which stood
by him in the shimmering frock, becurtained by her dark
hair, and in whose little head all this lived and meant something.
He said, &ldquo;Can you really waste a lovely morning
over all this God-forsaken stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glance of anger met him from her big eyes. Then she
answered with a pout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness seems to wish to excuse yourself for the
want of intelligence you recently displayed with regard to
your own exalted calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not so! I give you my word that I respect
your studies most highly. I grant that they bother me, I could
never understand anything of that sort. I also grant that to-day
I feel some resentment against them, as they seem likely
to prevent us from going for a ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not the only one to interfere with your wish
for exercise, Prince. There's the Countess too. She was
writing&mdash;chronicling the experiences of her life, not for the
world, but for private circulation, and I guarantee that the
result will be a work which will teach you as well as me a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure of it. But I am equally sure that the
Countess is incapable of refusing a request from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" title="226"> </a>&ldquo;And my father? There's the next stumbling-block. You
know his temper. Will he consent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has consented. If you ride, you ride. Those were
his words&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have made sure of him beforehand, then? I'm really
beginning to admire your circumspection. You have assumed
the rôle of a Field Marshal, although you are not really
a soldier, only a make-believe one, as you told us long ago.
But there's yet one more obstacle, and that is decisive. It's
going to rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that's a very weak one. The sun is shining&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's going to rain. The air is much too soft. I made
sure of it when we were in the Spa-Gardens before breakfast.
Come and look at the barometer if you don't believe me.
It's hanging in the hall&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went out into the tapestry hall, where a big weather-glass
hung near the marble fireplace. The Countess went with
them. Klaus Heinrich said: &ldquo;It's gone up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is pleased to deceive yourself,&rdquo; answered
Miss Spoelmann. &ldquo;The refraction misleads you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's beyond me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The refraction misleads you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what that is, Miss Spoelmann. It's the same
as with the Adirondacks. I've not had much schooling, that's
a necessary result of my kind of existence. You must make
allowances for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I humbly beg pardon. I ought to have remembered
that one must use ordinary words when talking to your Highness.
You are standing crooked to the hand and that makes
it look to you as if it had risen. If you would bring yourself
to stand straight in front of the glass, you would see
that the black has not risen above the gold hand, but has
actually dropped a little below it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really believe you are right,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The atmospheric pressure there is higher than I thought!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lower than you thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" title="227"> </a>&ldquo;But how about the falling quicksilver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The quicksilver falls at low pressure, not at high, Royal
Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I'm absolutely lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Prince, that you're exaggerating your ignorance
by way of a joke, so as to hide what its extent really is. But
as the atmospheric pressure is so high that the quicksilver
drops, thus showing an absolute disregard for the laws of
nature, let's go for a ride, Countess&mdash;shall we? I cannot
assume the responsibility of sending the Prince back home
again now that he has once come. He can wait in there till
we're ready&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Imma Spoelmann and the Countess came back to the
winter garden they were dressed for riding, Imma in a close-fitting
black habit with breast-pockets and a three-cornered
felt hat, the Countess in black cloth with a man's starched
shirt and high hat. They went together down the steps,
through the mosaic hall, and out into the open air, where
between the colonnade and the big basin two grooms were
waiting with the horses. But they had not yet mounted when
with a loud barking, which was the expression of his wild
excitement, Percival, the collie, prancing and leaping about,
tore out of the Schloss and began a frenzied dance round the
horses, who tossed their heads uneasily&hellip;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Imma, patting her favourite Fatma's
head, &ldquo;there was no hiding it from him. He found it all
out at the last moment. Now he intends to come with us and
make a fine to-do about it too. Shall we drop the whole
thing, Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But although Klaus Heinrich understood that he might just
as well have allowed the groom to ride in front with the
silver trumpet, so far as calling public attention to their
expedition was concerned, yet he said cheerfully that Percival
must come too; he was a member of the family and must
learn the neighbourhood like the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where shall we go?&rdquo; asked Imma as they rode at a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" title="228"> </a>
walk down the chestnut avenue. She rode between Klaus
Heinrich and the Countess. Percival barked in the van.
The English groom, in cockaded hat and yellow boot-tops,
rode at a respectful distance behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court Kennels are fine,&rdquo; answered Klaus Heinrich,
&ldquo;but it is a bit farther to the &lsquo;Pheasantry,&rsquo; and we have time
before lunch. I should like to show you the Schloss. I
spent three years there as a boy. It was a seminary, you
know, with tutors and other boys of my age. That's where
I got to know my friend Ueberbein, Doctor Ueberbein, my
favourite tutor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a friend?&rdquo; asked Miss Spoelmann, with some
surprise, and gazed at him. &ldquo;You must tell me about him
some time. And you were educated at the &lsquo;Pheasantry,&rsquo; were
you? Then we must see it, because you're obviously set on
it. Trot!&rdquo; she said as they turned into a loose riding-path.
&ldquo;There lies your hermitage, Prince. There's plenty for the
ducks to eat in your pond. Let's give a wide berth to the
Spa-Gardens, if that does not take us far out of our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich agreed, so they left the park and trotted
across country to reach the high-road which led to their goal
to the north-west. In the town gardens they were greeted
with surprise by a few promenaders, whose greetings Klaus
Heinrich acknowledged by raising his hand to his cap, Imma
Spoelmann with a grave and rather embarrassed inclination
of her dark head in the three-cornered hat. By now they had
reached the open country, and were no longer likely to meet
people. Now and then a peasant's cart rolled along the road,
or a crouching bicyclist ploughed his way along it. But they
turned aside from the road when they reached the meadow-land,
which provided better going for their horses. Percival danced
backwards in front of them, feverish and restless as ever,
turning, springing, and wagging his tail&mdash;his breath came
fast, his tongue hung far out of his foaming jaws, and he
vented his nervous exaltation in a succession of short, sobbing
yelps. Farther on he dashed off, following some scent with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" title="229"> </a>
pricked ears and short springs, while his wild barking echoed
through the air.</p>

<p>They discussed Fatma, which Klaus Heinrich had not yet
seen close, and which he admired immensely. Fatma had
a long, muscular neck and small, nodding head with fiery
eyes; she had the slender legs of the Arab type, and a bushy
tail. She was white as the moonlight, and saddled, girt, and
bridled with white leather. Florian, a rather sleepy brown,
with a short back, hogged mane, and yellow stockings, looked
as homely as a donkey by the side of the distinguished foreigner,
although he was carefully groomed. Countess Löwenjoul
rode a big cream called Isabeau. She had an excellent seat,
with her tall, straight figure, but she held her small head in its
huge hat on one side, and her lids were half closed and
twitched. Klaus Heinrich addressed some remarks to her
behind Miss Spoelmann's back, but she did not answer, and
went riding on with half-shut eyes, gazing in front of her
with a Madonna-like expression, and Imma said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't let's bother the Countess, Prince, her thoughts are
wandering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the Countess was not annoyed at
having to come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he was distinctly taken aback when Imma Spoelmann
answered casually: &ldquo;To tell the truth, she very likely was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of your sums?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the sums? They're not so urgent, only a way of passing
the time&mdash;although I hope to get a good lot of useful information
out of them. But I don't mind telling you, Prince,
that the Countess is not enthusiastic on the subject of yourself.
She has expressed herself to that effect to me. She said you
were hard and stern and affected her like a cold douche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich reddened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; he said quietly, looking down at his reins,
&ldquo;that I don't act as a cordial, Miss Spoelmann, or, at any
rate, only at a distance&hellip;. That, too, is inseparable from
my kind of existence, as I said. But I am not conscious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" title="230"> </a>
of having shown myself hard and stern to the Countess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not in words,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but you did not
allow her to let herself go, you did not do her the kindness
of letting her tongue run a little, that's why she's vexed with
you&mdash;and I know quite well what you did, how you embarrassed
the poor thing and gave her a cold douche&mdash;quite
well,&rdquo; she repeated, and turned her head away.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich did not answer. He kept his left hand
planted on his hip, and his eyes were tired. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know quite well? So I act like a cold douche on
you too, Miss Spoelmann, do I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; she answered at once in her broken voice,
and wagging her head from side to side, &ldquo;on no account to
overrate the effect you have upon me, Prince.&rdquo; And she
suddenly <ins title="sat">set</ins> Fatma off at a gallop and flew at such a pace
over the fields towards the dark mass of the distant pine-woods
that neither the Countess nor Klaus Heinrich could keep
up with her. Not till she reached the edge of the wood
through which the high-road ran did she halt and turn her
horse to look mockingly at her followers.</p>

<p>Countess Löwenjoul on her cream was the first to come
up with the runaway. Then came Florian, foaming and much
exhausted by his unusual exertion. They all laughed and
their breath came fast as they entered the echoing wood. The
Countess had awakened and chatted merrily, making lively,
graceful gestures and showing her white teeth. She poked fun
at Percival, whose temper had again been excited by the
gallop, and who was careering wildly among the trunks in
front of the horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Royal Highness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you ought to see him jump
and turn somersaults. He can take a ditch six yards broad,
and does it so lightly and gracefully, you'd be delighted.
But only of his own accord, mind you, of his free will, for
I believe he'd rather let himself be whipped to death than
submit to any training or teaching of tricks. He is, one might
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" title="231"> </a>
say, his own trainer by nature, and though sometimes unruly
he is never rough. He is a gentleman, an aristocrat, and
full of character. He's as proud as you like, and though he
seems mad he's quite able to control himself. Nobody has
ever heard him cry for pain when punished and hurt. He
only eats, too, when he is hungry, and at other times won't
look at the most tempting dainties. In the morning he has
cream &hellip; he must be fed. He wears himself out, he's quite
thin under his glossy coat, you can feel all his ribs. For
I'm afraid he'll never grow to be old, but will fall an early
victim to consumption. The street curs persecute him, they
go for him in every street, but he jumps clear of them, and
if they succeed in joining issue with him, he distributes a few
bites with his splendid teeth which the rabble don't forget in
a hurry. One must love such a compound of chivalry and
virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imma agreed, in words which were the most serious and
grave which Klaus Heinrich had ever heard from her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you're a good friend to me, Percy, I
shall always love you. A veterinary surgeon said you were
half mad and advised us to have you put away, as you were
impossible and a constant danger to us. But they shan't take
my Percy from me. He is impossible, I know, and often
an incumbrance, but he's always appealing and noble, and
I love him dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess continued to talk about the collie's nature,
but her remarks soon became disconnected and confused, and
lapsed into a monologue accompanied by lively and elegant
gestures. At last, after an acid look at Klaus Heinrich, her
thoughts again began to wander.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich felt happy and cheered, whether as the result
of the canter&mdash;for which he had had to brace himself up, for,
though a decent figure on a horse, his left hand prevented him
from being a strong rider&mdash;or for some other reason. After
leaving the pine-wood they rode along the quiet high-road
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" title="232"> </a>
between meadows and furrowed fields, with a peasant's hut
or a country inn here and there. As they drew near the next
wood, he asked in a low voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you fulfil your promise and tell me about the
Countess? What is your companion's history?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is my friend,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and in a sense my
governess too, although she did not come to us till I was
grown up. That was three years ago, in New York, and
the Countess was then in a terrible state. She was on the
brink of starvation,&rdquo; said Miss Spoelmann, and as she said
it she fastened her big black eyes with a searching, startled
look on Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really starvation?&rdquo; he asked, and returned her look&hellip;.
&ldquo;Do please go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said that too when she came to us, and although I,
of course, saw quite well that her mind was slightly affected,
she made such an impression upon me that I persuaded my father
to let her be my companion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What took her to America? Is she a countess by birth?&rdquo;
asked Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a countess, but of noble birth, brought up in refined
and luxurious surroundings, sheltered and protected, as she expressed
it to me, from every wind, because from childhood she
had been impressionable and sensitive. But then she married
a Count Löwenjoul, a cavalry captain&mdash;a strange specimen of
the aristocracy, according to her account&mdash;not quite up to the
mark, to put it mildly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was wrong with him?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't exactly tell you, Prince. You must take into consideration
the rather obscure way in which the Countess puts
what she has to say. But, to judge from what she has told me,
he must have been just about as arrant a scamp as one could
well imagine&mdash;a regular blackguard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;what's called a hard case, or
a tough proposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly; we'll say man of the world&mdash;but in the most comprehensive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" title="233"> </a>
and unlimited sense, for, to judge by the Countess's
remarks, there were no limits in his case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that's what I too gathered,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I've
met several people of that sort&mdash;regular devils, so to speak. I
heard of one such, who used to make love in his motor car, even
when it was going at full speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your friend Ueberbein tell you of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, somebody else. Ueberbein would not think it proper
to mention anything of that sort to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he must be a useless sort of friend, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll think better of him when I tell you more about him,
Miss Spoelmann. But please go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know whether Löwenjoul behaved like your
roué. Anyhow he behaved disgracefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect he gambled and drank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so. And besides that of course he made love, neglected
the Countess and carried on with the loose women that
are always to be found everywhere&mdash;at first behind her back,
and later no longer behind her back but impudently and openly
without any regard for her feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me, why did she ever marry him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She married him against her parents' will, because, as she
has told me, she was in love with him. For in the first place,
he was a handsome man when she first met him&mdash;he fell off in
his looks later. In the second place, his reputation as a man
of the world had gone before him, and that, according to her,
constituted a sort of irresistible attraction for her, for, though
she had been so well sheltered and protected, nothing would
shake her in her resolve to share her life with him. If one
thinks it over, one can quite understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can quite understand it. She wanted to
have her fling, as it were, to get her eyes opened. And she saw
the world with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may put it like that if you like: though the expression
seems to me rather too flippant to describe her experiences.
Her husband ill-treated her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" title="234"> </a>&ldquo;Do you mean that he beat her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he ill-treated her physically. But now comes something,
Prince, which you too will not have heard about before.
She gave me to understand that he ill-treated her not only in
a temper, not only in anger and rage, but also without being
exasperated, simply for his own satisfaction. I mean, that his
caresses were so revolting as to amount to ill-treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was silent. Both looked very grave. At
last he asked: &ldquo;Did the Countess have any children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two. They died quite young, both only a few weeks
old, and that's the greatest sorrow the Countess has had to bear.
It would seem from her hints that it was the fault of the loose
women for whom her husband betrayed her that the children
died directly after birth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both remained silent, and their eyes clouded over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Add to that,&rdquo; continued Imma Spoelmann, &ldquo;that he dissipated
his wife's dowry, at cards and with women&mdash;a respectable
dowry it was too&mdash;and after her parents' death her whole
fortune also. Relations of hers too helped him once, when he
was near having to leave the service on account of his debts.
But then came a scandal, an altogether revolting one, in
which he was involved and which did for him once and for
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Klaus Heinrich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't exactly tell you, Prince. But, according to what
the Countess has let slip about it, it was a scandal of the very
grossest description&mdash;we agreed just now that there are generally
no limits in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then he went to America?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're right there, Prince. I can't help admiring your
'cuteness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please go on, Miss Spoelmann. I've never heard anything
like the Countess's story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more had I; so you can imagine what an impression it
made on me when she came to us. Well, then, Count Löwenjoul
bolted to America with the police at his heels, leaving
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" title="235"> </a>
pretty considerable debts behind of course. And the Countess
went with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went with him? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she still loved him, in spite of everything&mdash;she
loves him still&mdash;and because she was determined to share his
life whatever happened. He took her with him, though, because
he had a better chance of getting help from her relations
as long as she was with him. The relations sent him one further
instalment of money from home, and then stopped&mdash;they
finally buttoned up their pockets; and when Count Löwenjoul
saw that his wife was no more use to him, he just left her&mdash;left
her in absolute destitution and cleared out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;I expected as much.
Just what does happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Imma Spoelmann went on: &ldquo;So there she was, destitute
and helpless, and, since she had never learned to earn her own
living, she was left alone to face want and hunger. And you
must remember that life in the States is much harder and
meaner than here in your country; also that the Countess has
always been a gentle, sensitive creature, and has been cruelly
treated for years. In a word, she was no fit subject for the
impressions of life to which she was unceasingly exposed.
And then the blessing fell to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What blessing? She told me about that too. What was
the blessing, Miss Spoelmann?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blessing consisted in a mental disturbance. At the
crisis of her troubles something in her cracked&mdash;that's the
expression she used to me&mdash;so that she no longer needed to
face life and to bring a clear, sober mind to bear upon it, but
was permitted, so to speak, to let herself go, to relax the tension
of her nerves and to drivel when she liked. In a word,
the blessing was that she went wrong in her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I was under the impression,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich,
&ldquo;that the Countess was letting herself go when she drivelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's how it is, Prince. She is quite conscious of drivelling,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" title="236"> </a>
and often laughs as she does so, or lets her hearers
understand that she doesn't mean any harm by it. Her
strangeness is a beneficent disorder, which she can control to
a certain extent, and which she allows herself to indulge in.
It is, if you prefer it, a want of<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of self-restraint,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, and looked down
at his reins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, of self-restraint,&rdquo; she repeated, and looked at him.
&ldquo;You don't seem to approve of that want, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider as a general rule,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;that
it is not right to let oneself go and to make oneself at home,
but that self-restraint should always be exercised, whatever
the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness's doctrine,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is a praiseworthy
austerity.&rdquo; Then she pouted, and, wagging her dark
head in its three-cornered hat, she added in her broken voice:
&ldquo;I'll tell you something, Highness, and please note it well.
If your Eminence is not inclined to show a little sympathy
and indulgence and mildness, I shall have to decline the pleasure
of your distinguished company once and for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his head, and they rode a while in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you go on to tell me how the Countess came to you?&rdquo;
he asked at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won't,&rdquo; she said, and looked straight in front of her.
But he pressed her so pleadingly that she finished her story
and said: &ldquo;And although fifty other companions applied,
my choice&mdash;for the choice rested with me&mdash;fell at once on
her, I was so much taken with her at my first interview. She
was odd, I could see that: but she was odd only from too
rich an experience of misery and wickedness, that was clear
in every word she said; and as for me, I had always been a
little lonely and cut off, and absolutely without experience,
except what I got at my University lectures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you had always been a little lonely and cut off!&rdquo;
repeated Klaus Heinrich, with a ring of joy in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what I said. It was a dull, simple life in some
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" title="237"> </a>
ways that I led, and still lead, because it has not altered much,
and is all much the same. There were parties with &lsquo;lions&rsquo; and
balls, and often a dash in a closed motor to the Opera House,
where I sat in one of the little boxes above the stalls, so as to
be well observed by everybody, for show, as we say. That
was a necessary part of my position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For show?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for show; I mean the duty of showing oneself off,
of not raising walls against the public, but letting them come
into the garden and walk on the lawn and gaze at the terrace,
watching us at tea. My father, Mr. Spoelmann, disliked it intensely.
But it was a necessary consequence of our position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you usually do besides, Miss Spoelmann?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the spring we went to our house in the Adirondacks and
in the summer to our house at Newport-on-Sea. There were
garden-parties of course, and battles of flowers and lawn-tennis
tournaments, and we went for rides and drove four-in-hand
or motored, and the people stood and gaped, because I was
Samuel Spoelmann's daughter. And many shouted rude remarks
after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rude remarks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they probably had reason to. At any rate it
was something of a life in the limelight that we led, and one
that invited discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And between whiles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you played in the breezes,
didn't you, or rather in a vacuum, where no dust came<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right. Your Highness is pleased to mock my excess
of candour. But in view of all this you can guess how
extraordinarily welcome the Countess was to me, when she
came to see me in Fifth Avenue. She does not express herself
very clearly, but rather in a mysterious sort of way, and
the boundary line at which she begins to drivel is not always
quite clearly apparent. But that only strikes me as right and
instructive, as it gives a good idea of the boundlessness of
misery and wickedness in the world. You envy me the
Countess, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" title="238"> </a>&ldquo;Envy? H'm. You seem to assume, Miss Spoelmann, that
I have never had my eyes opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once or twice, maybe. For instance, things have come
to my ears about our lackeys, which you would scarcely
dream of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are your lackeys so bad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad? Good-for-nothing, that's what they are. For one
thing they play into each other's hands, and scheme, and take
bribes from the tradesmen<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Prince, that's comparatively harmless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, true, it's nothing to compare with the way the Countess
has had her eyes opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They broke into a trot, and, leaving at the sign-post the
gently rising and falling high-road, which they had followed
through the pine-woods, turned into the sandy short cut, between
high blackberry-covered banks, which led into the tufted
meadow-land round the &ldquo;Pheasantry.&rdquo; Klaus Heinrich was
at home in these parts: he stretched out his arm (the right
one) to point out everything to his companions, though there
was not much worth seeing. Yonder lay the Schloss, closed
and silent, with its shingle-roof and its lightning-conductors
on the edge of the wood. On one side was the pheasants' enclosure,
which gave the place its name, and on the other
Stavenüter's tea-garden, where he had sometimes sat with
Raoul Ueberbein. The spring sun shone mildly over the damp
meadow-land and shed a soft haze over the distant woods.</p>

<p>They reined in their horses in front of the tea-garden, and
Imma <ins title="Spoelman">Spoelmann</ins> took stock of the prosaic country-house which
rejoiced in the name of the &ldquo;Pheasantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your childhood,&rdquo; she said with a pout, &ldquo;does not seem
to have been surrounded by much giddy splendour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;there's nothing to see in the Schloss.
It's the same inside as out. No comparison with Delphinenort,
even before you restored it<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's put our horses up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One must put one's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" title="239"> </a>
horses up on an expedition, mustn't one, Countess? Dismount,
Prince. I'm thirsty, and want to see what your friend
Stavenüter has got to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There stood Herr Stavenüter in green apron and stockings,
bowing and pressing his knitted cap to his chest with both
hands, while he laughed till his gums showed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Royal Highness!&rdquo; he said, with joy in his voice, &ldquo;does
your Royal Highness mean to honour me once again? And
the young lady!&rdquo; he added, with a tinge of deference in his
voice; for he knew Samuel Spoelmann's daughter quite well,
and there had been in the whole Grand Duchy no more eager
reader of the newspaper articles which coupled Prince Klaus
Heinrich's and Imma's names together. He helped the Countess
to dismount, while Klaus Heinrich, who was the first to
the ground, devoted himself to Miss Spoelmann, and he called
to a lad, who, with the Spoelmanns' groom, took charge of
the horses. Then followed the reception and welcome to
which Klaus Heinrich was accustomed. He addressed a few
formal questions in a reserved tone of voice to Herr Stavenüter,
graciously asked how he was and how his business prospered,
and received the answers with nods and a show of real interest.
Imma Spoelmann watched his artificial, cold demeanour
with serious, searching eyes, while she swung her riding-whip
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I be so bold as to remind you that I am thirsty?&rdquo;
she said at last sharply and decisively, whereupon they walked
into the garden and discussed whether they need go in to the
coffee-room. Klaus Heinrich urged that it was still so damp
under the trees; but Imma insisted on sitting outside, and
herself chose one of the long narrow tables with benches on
each side, which Herr Stavenüter hastened to cover with a
white cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemonade!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's best for a thirst, and it's
sound stuff! no trash, Royal Highness, and you, ladies, but
natural juice sweetened&mdash;there's no better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Followed the driving-in of the glass balls in the necks of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" title="240"> </a>
the bottles; and, while his distinguished guests tasted the
drink, Herr Stavenüter dawdled a little longer at the table,
meaning to serve them up a little gossip. He had long been
a widower, and his three children, who in days gone by had
sung here under the trees the song about common humanity,
the while blowing their noses with their fingers, had now left
him. The son was a soldier in the capital, one of the daughters
had married a neighbouring farmer, the other, with a soul
for higher things, had gone into service in the capital.</p>

<p>So Herr Stavenüter was in solitary control in this remote
spot, in the three-fold capacity of farmer of the Schloss lands,
caretaker of the Schloss, and head keeper of the &ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo;
and was well content with his lot. Soon, if the weather permitted,
the season for bicyclists and walkers would come
round, when the garden was filled on Sundays. Then business
hummed. Would not his Highness and the ladies like to take
a peep at the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Yes, they would, later; so Herr Stavenüter withdrew for
the present, after placing a saucer of milk for Percival by the
table.</p>

<p>The collie had been in some muddy water on the way, and
looked horrible. His legs were thin with wet, and the white
parts of his ragged coat covered with dirt. His gaping mouth
was black to the throat from nuzzling for field-mice, and his
dark red tongue hung dripping out of his mouth. He quickly
lapped up his milk, and then lay with panting sides by his
mistress's feet, flat on his side, his head thrown back in an
attitude of repose.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich declared it to be inexcusable for Imma to
expose herself after her ride to the invidious springtime air
without any wrap. &ldquo;Take my cloak,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I really
do not want it, I'm quite warm, and my coat is padded on the
chest!&rdquo; She would not hear of it; but he went on asking her
so insistently that she consented, and let him lay his grey
military coat with a major's shoulder-straps round her shoulders.
Then, resting her dark head in its three-cornered hat in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" title="241"> </a>
the hollow of her hand, she watched him as, with arm outstretched
towards the Schloss, he described to her the life
he had once led there.</p>

<p>There, where the tall window opened on to the ground, had
been the mess-room, then the school-room, and up above
Klaus Heinrich's room with the plaster torso on the stove.
He told her too about Professor Kürtchen and his tactful way
of instructing his pupils, about Captain Amelung's widow,
and the aristocratic &ldquo;Pheasants,&rdquo; who called everything &ldquo;hog-wash,&rdquo;
and especially about Raoul Ueberbein, his friend, of
whom Imma Spoelmann more than once asked him to tell her
some more.</p>

<p>He told her about the doctor's obscure origin, and about
the money his parents paid to be quit of him; about the child
in the marsh or bog, and the medal for saving life; about
Ueberbein's plucky and ambitious career, pursued in circumstances
calling for resolution and action, which he used to
call favourable circumstances, and about his friendship with
Doctor Sammet, whom Imma knew. He described his by no
means attractive appearance and readily owned to the attraction
which he had exercised on him from the very beginning.
He described his behaviour towards himself, Klaus Heinrich&mdash;that
fatherly and jolly, blustering camaraderie which had
distinguished him so sharply from everybody else&mdash;and gave
Imma to the best of his ability an insight into his tutor's views
of life. Finally he expressed his concern that the doctor
seemed not to enjoy any sort of popularity among his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe that,&rdquo; said Imma.</p>

<p>He was surprised, and asked why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I'm convinced,&rdquo; she said, wagging her head, &ldquo;that
your Ueberbein, for all his sparkling conversation, is an unhappy
sort of creature. He may swagger about the place;
but he lacks reserve, Prince, and that means that he will come
to a bad end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words startled Klaus Heinrich, and made him thoughtful.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" title="242"> </a>
Then turning to the Countess, who awoke with a smile
out of a brown study, he said something complimentary about
her riding, for which she thanked him gracefully. He said
that anybody could see that she had learnt to ride as a child,
and she confessed that riding lessons had formed a considerable
part of her education. She spoke clearly and cheerfully;
but gradually, almost imperceptibly, she began to wander into
a strange story about a gallant ride which she had made as a
lieutenant in the last man&oelig;uvres, and suddenly started talking
about the dreadful wife of a sergeant in the Grenadiers,
who had come into her room the previous night and scratched
her breasts all over, meanwhile using language which she
could not bring herself to repeat. Klaus Heinrich asked
quietly whether she had not shut her door and windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but anyone could break the glass!&rdquo; she answered
hastily, and turned pale in one cheek and red in the
other. Klaus Heinrich nodded acquiescence, and, dropping
his eyes, asked her quietly to let him call her &ldquo;Frau Meier&rdquo;
now and then, a proposal which she gladly accepted, with a
confidential smile and a far-away look which had something
strangely attractive about it.</p>

<p>They got up to visit the &ldquo;Pheasantry,&rdquo; after Klaus Heinrich
had taken back his cloak; and as they left the garden, Imma
Spoelmann said: &ldquo;Well done, Prince. You're getting on,&rdquo;
a commendation which made him blush, indeed gave him far
more pleasure than the most fulsome newspaper report of the
valuable effect of his appearance at a ceremony which Councillor
Schustermann could ever show him.</p>

<p>Herr Stavenüter escorted his guests into the palisaded enclosure
in which six or seven families of pheasants led a comfortable,
petted life. They watched the greedy, red-eyed, and
stiff-tailed birds, inspected the hatching house, and looked on
while Herr Stavenüter fed the pheasants under a big solitary
fig-tree for their benefit. Klaus Heinrich thanked him warmly
for all that he had shown them, Imma Spoelmann regarding
him the while with her big, searching eyes. Then they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" title="243"> </a>
mounted at the gate of the tea-garden and rode off homewards
with Percival barking and pirouetting under the horses'
noses.</p>

<p>But their ride home was destined to give Klaus Heinrich,
in the course of his conversation with Imma Spoelmann, yet
another significant indication of her real nature and character,
a direct revelation of certain sides of her personality which
gave him food for much thought.</p>

<p>For soon after they had left the bramble-hedged by-way
and joined the high-road, Klaus Heinrich reverted to a subject
which had been just touched on at his first visit to Delphinenort
during the conversation at tea, and had not ceased to exercise
him ever since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ask you one question, Miss Spoelmann?
You need not answer it if you don't want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll see about that,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four weeks ago,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;when I first had the pleasure
of a talk with your father, Mr. Spoelmann, I asked him a
question which he answered so curtly and abruptly that I
could not help feeling that my question had been indiscreet
or a false step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him whether he had not found it hard to leave
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are, Prince, there's another question which is
worthy of you, a typical Prince-question. If you had had a
little more training in the use of your reasoning powers you
would have known without asking that if my father had not
been ready and glad to leave America, he most assuredly would
not have left it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very probably you are right; forgive me, I don't think
enough. But if my question was nothing worse than a want
of thought, I shall be quite content. Can you assure me that
that is the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Prince, I'm afraid I cannot,&rdquo; she said, and looked at
him suddenly with her big black eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" title="244"> </a>&ldquo;Then what has want of thought to do with it? Do please
explain. I ask you in the name of our friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped so,&rdquo; he said pleadingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, patience! I didn't know it, but I'm quite ready
to learn it. But to return to my father, he really did lose
his temper at your question&mdash;he has a quick temper, and has
plenty of occasion to practise losing it. The fact is that public
opinion and sentiment were not over-friendly to us in
America. There's such a lot of scheming over there&mdash;I may
mention that I am not posted in the details, but there was a
strong political movement towards setting the crowd, the common
people, you know, against us. The result was legislation
and restrictions which made my father's life over there a
burden to him. You know of course, Prince, that it was not
he who made us what we are, but my redoubtable grandfather
with his Paradise nugget and Blockhead Farm. My father
could not help it, he was born to his destiny, and it was no
gratification to him, because he is naturally shy and sensitive,
and would much have preferred to have lived for playing the
organ and collecting glass. I really believe that the hatred
which was the result of the scheming against us, so that sometimes
the people hurled abuse after me when I motored past
them&mdash;that the hatred quite probably brought on his stone in
the kidneys; it's more than possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am cordially attached to your father,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich
with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have made that, Prince, a condition of our becoming
friends. But there was another point which made things
worse, and made our position over there still more difficult,
and that was our origin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your origin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Prince; we are no aristocratic pheasants, unfortunately
we are not descended from Washington or from the Pilgrim
Fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, for you are German.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" title="245"> </a>&ldquo;Oh yes, but there's something besides to get over. Please
look at me closely. Does it strike you that there is anything
to be proud of in having blue-black wispy hair like mine, that's
always falling where it's not wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows, Miss Spoelmann, you've got glorious
hair!&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I know that you are partly of
Southern extraction, for I've read somewhere that your grandfather
married in Bolivia or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did. But that's where the trouble lies, Prince. I'm a
quintroon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quintroon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That goes with the Adirondacks and the refraction, Miss
Spoelmann. I don't know what it is. I've already told you
that I don't know much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's a fact. My grandfather, thoughtless as he always
was, married a woman of Indian blood down South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indian blood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She was of Indian stock at the third remove, daughter
of a white and a half-Indian, and so a terceroon as it is called.
She must have been wonderfully beautiful. And she was my
grandmother. The grandchildren of a terceroon are called
quintroons. That's how things are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most interesting. But didn't you say that it had affected
people's attitude towards you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't understand, Prince. I must tell you that Indian
blood over there means a heavy blot&mdash;such a blot, that friendships
and affections are transformed into hatred and abuse if
proof of half-blood descent comes to light. Of course things
are not so serious with us, for with quadroons&mdash;why, of
course, the taint is nothing like so great, and a quintroon is to
all intents and purposes untainted. But in our case, exposed
to gossip as we were, it was naturally different, and several
times when the people shouted abuse after us I heard them say
that I was a coloured girl. In short, my descent was made an
excuse for insults and annoyances, and raised a barrier between
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" title="246"> </a>
us and the few who were in the same position of life
as ourselves&mdash;there was always something which we had to
hide or to brazen out. My grandfather had brazened it out,
he was that sort of man, and knew what he was doing;
besides, his blood was pure, it was only his beautiful wife
who had the taint. But my father was her son, and, sensitive
and quick-tempered as he is, he has always, ever since he was
a boy, resented being stared at, and hated and despised at
the same time; half a world's wonder and half a monument of
iniquity, as he used to say. He was fed up with America.
That's the whole history, Prince,&rdquo; said Imma Spoelmann,
&ldquo;and now you know why my father lost his temper over your
pointed question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich thanked her for the explanation; indeed,
as he saluted and took leave (it was lunch time) of the
ladies in front of the Delphinenort Gate, he repeated his
thanks for what he had been told, and then rode at foot's
pace home, pondering over the events of the morning.</p>

<p>He saw Imma Spoelmann sitting in a languid pose in her
red-gold dress at the table, with a look as of a spoilt child
on her face; sitting in comfortable assurance, and uttering
remarks with a sting in them, such as were good coin in the
United States, where clearness, hardness, and a ready wit
were essentials of life. And why? Klaus Heinrich could
understand now, and never a day passed that he did not try
to realize it better. Stared at, hated and despised at the
same time, half a world's wonder and half a monument of
iniquity, that's what her life had been, and that had instilled
the poison into her remarks, that acidity and mocking directness,
which looked like offence but really were defence, and
which evoked a look of bewilderment on the faces of those
who had never had any occasion for the weapons of wit.</p>

<p>She had demanded of him sympathy and tenderness towards
the poor Countess, when she let herself go; but she herself
had a claim to sympathy and tenderness, for she was lonely
and her life, like his, was a hard one. At the same time a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_247" title="247"> </a>
memory haunted him, a long-ago, painful memory, whose
scene was the refreshment room of the &ldquo;Citizen Garden,&rdquo;
and which ended in a tureen lid<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&ldquo;Little sister!&rdquo; he said
to himself, as he quickly dismissed the scene from his thoughts.
&ldquo;Little sister!&rdquo; But most of all his thoughts were busy with
planning how soonest to enjoy Miss Spoelmann's society
again.</p>

<p>He enjoyed it soon and often, in all sorts of circumstances.
February gave place to threatening March, fickle April and
soft May. And all these months Klaus Heinrich visited
Schloss Delphinenort at least once a week, in the morning or
in the afternoon, and always in the irresponsible mood in
which he had presented himself at the Spoelmanns' that
February morning, as if led by fate without any action of
his own will. The proximity of the Schlosses made the visits
easy, the short distance through the park from the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo;
to Delphinenort was easily crossed on horseback or in a dogcart,
without exciting much attention; and when the advancing
season brought more people to the neighbourhood and made
it harder and harder for them to go for rides without attracting
public attention, the Prince had by this time reached a
state of mind which can only be described as complete indifference
and blind recklessness towards the world, the Court,
the capital, and the countryside. It was not till later that
the public interest began to play a really important&mdash;and
encouraging&mdash;part in his thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>He had not taken leave of the ladies after the first ride
without suggesting another expedition, a suggestion to which
Imma Spoelmann, pouting and wagging her head from side
to side, had failed to bring any serious objection. So he
came again; and they rode to the Royal Kennels, on the
north side of the Town Gardens; on the third occasion they
chose a third place to ride to, which also they could reach
without going near the town. Then, when spring enticed the
townspeople into the open air and the tea-gardens filled up,
they preferred an out-of-the-way path, which really was no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_248" title="248"> </a>
path, but a richly wooded dyke, which stretched far away to
the north along a swift-running stream.</p>

<p>The quietest way of reaching it was by riding out at the
back of the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; park, and past the river meadows
on the edge of the northern Town Garden up to the Royal
Kennels; then not crossing the river by the wooden bridge
at the weir, but keeping along this side. The Kennels Farm
was left behind on the right, and the ride went on through
the fir-plantations. On the left lay spreading meadows, white
and gaily coloured with hemlock and anemones, buttercups
and bluebells, clover, daisies, and forget-me-nots; a village
church tower rose in front of them beyond the plough-lands,
and the busy high-road lay far away at a safe distance from
the riders. Farther on, the meadows with their nut-hedges
came close up to the plantations on the left, shutting out the
view, and enabling them to ride in complete seclusion,
generally side by side with the Countess behind, as the path
was narrow. They talked or rode in silence, while Percival
jumped over the stream and back again, or plunged into
it for a bath or a hurried drink. They came back the same
way as they went.</p>

<p>When, however, the quicksilver fell owing to the lowness of
the atmospheric pressure, when rain followed, and Klaus Heinrich
nevertheless felt another peep at Imma Spoelmann to
be a necessity, he presented himself in his dogcart at Delphinenort
at tea time, and they stayed indoors. Mr. Spoelmann
joined them at tea not more than two or three times.
His malady got worse about this time, and on several days
he was obliged to stay in bed with hot poultices. When he
did come, he used to say: &ldquo;Hullo, young Prince,&rdquo; with his
thin, white-cuffed hand dip a rusk in his tea, throw in a
cross word here and there into the conversation, and end by
offering his guest his gold cigarette-case, whereupon he left
the garden room with Dr. Watercloose, who had sat silent and
smiling at the table. In fine weather too they sometimes
preferred not to go outside the park, but to play lawn tennis
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" title="249"> </a>
on the trim lawn below the terrace. On one occasion they
went for a rapid drive in Mr. Spoelmann's motor far out
beyond the &ldquo;Pheasantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day Klaus Heinrich asked: &ldquo;Is what I have read
true, Miss Spoelmann, that your father gets such a tremendous
lot of letters and appeals every day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she described to him subscription lists which kept
pouring in to Delphinenort, and which were dealt with as
thoroughly as was practicable; of the piles of begging letters
by every post from Europe and America which Messrs. Phlebs
and Slippers ran through and weeded out for submission to
Mr. Spoelmann. Sometimes, she said, she amused herself
by glancing through the heaps, and reading the addresses;
for these were often quite fantastic. For the needy or
speculative senders tried to outdo each other in the deference
and servility of their address on the envelopes, and every
conceivable title and distinction could be found mixed up
in the strangest way on the letters. But one begging-letter
writer had quite recently carried off the prize by addressing
his envelope to: &ldquo;His Royal Highness Mr. Samuel Spoelmann.&rdquo;
But it did not get him any more than the others.</p>

<p>On other occasions the Prince fell to talking mysteriously
about the &ldquo;Owl Chamber&rdquo; in the Old Schloss, and confided
to her that recently noises had again been heard in it, pointing
to events of moment in his, Klaus Heinrich's, family.
Then Imma Spoelmann laughed, and, pouting and wagging
her head from side to side, gave him a scientific explanation
of the noises, just as she had done in connexion with the
secrets of the barometer. Nonsense, she said; it must be
that that part of the lumber-room was ellipsoidal, and a
second ellipsoidal surface with the same curvature and with
a sound-source at the focus existed somewhere outside, the
result being that inside the haunted room noises were audible
which could not be distinguished in the immediate neighbourhood.
Klaus Heinrich was rather crestfallen over this explanation,
and loath to give up the common belief in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_250" title="250"> </a>
connexion between the lumber-room and the fortunes of his
house.</p>

<p>Thus they conversed, and the Countess too took part, now
sensible, now confused; Klaus Heinrich took considerable
pains not to rebuff or chill her by his manner, and addressed
her as &ldquo;Frau Meier&rdquo; whenever she appeared to think it
necessary for her protection against the plots of the wicked
women. He recounted to the ladies his unreal life, the gala
suppers at the students' clubs, the military banquets, and his
educational tour; he told them about his relations, about his
once-beautiful mother, whom he visited now and then in the
&ldquo;Segenhaus,&rdquo; where she kept dismal court, and about Albrecht
and Ditlinde. Imma Spoelmann in her turn related some
incidents in her luxurious and singular youth, and the Countess
often slipped in a few dark sayings about the horrors and
secrets of life, to which the others listened with serious and
thoughtful faces.</p>

<p>They took special delight in one kind of game&mdash;guessing
existences, making estimates to the best of their knowledge
of the people they happened to see in the citizen world&mdash;a
strange and curious study of the passers-by from a distant
standpoint, from the terrace or from horseback. What kind
of young people might these be? What did they do? Where
did they come from? They were certainly not apprentices,
perhaps technical students or budding foresters, to judge by
certain signs; maybe they belonged to the agricultural college;
at any rate stout fellows enough, though rather rough, with
sound careers before them. But that little untidy thing who
strolled past looked like a factory hand or dressmaker's
assistant. Girls like her always had a young man in their
own class, who took them out to tea in the parks on Sundays.
And they exchanged what they knew about people in general,
discussed them like connoisseurs, and felt that this pastime
brought them closer together than any amount of riding or
lawn tennis.</p>

<p>As for the motor drive, Imma Spoelmann in the course of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" title="251"> </a>
it explained that she had only invited Klaus Heinrich to it
so as to let him see the chauffeur, a young American in
brown leather, who, she declared, resembled the Prince.
Klaus Heinrich objected with a smile that the back of the
driver's neck did not enable him to express an opinion on
the matter, and asked the Countess to say what she thought.
She, after long denying the likeness in polite embarrassment,
at last, on Imma's insistence, with a side glance at Klaus
Heinrich, agreed to it.</p>

<p>Then Miss Spoelmann said that the grave, sober, and skilful
youth had originally been in her father's personal service,
driving him daily from Fifth Avenue to Broadway and back.
Mr. Spoelmann, however, had insisted on extraordinary speed,
like that of an express train, and the intense strain put upon
a driver by such speed in the crowded streets of New York
had proved at last too much for the youth. As a matter of
fact no accident had happened; the young man had stuck to it
and done his deadly duty with amazing care. But in the end
it had often happened that he had to be lifted down in a faint
from his seat at the end of a run&mdash;a proof of the inordinate
strain to which he had been daily subjected. To avoid having
to dismiss him, Mr. Spoelmann had made him his daughter's
special chauffeur, and he had continued to act in that capacity
in their new abode.</p>

<p>Imma had noticed the likeness between Klaus Heinrich
and him the first time she saw the Prince. It was of course
a similarity not of features, but of expression. The Countess
had agreed with her. Klaus Heinrich said that he did not
in the least object to the likeness, as the heroic young man
had all his sympathy. They then discussed further the difficult
and anxious life of a chauffeur, without Countess Löwenjoul
taking any further part in the conversation. She did not
prattle during this drive, though later she made a few sensible
and pointed remarks.</p>

<p>For the rest, Mr. Spoelmann's craze for speed seemed to
have descended in some measure to his daughter, for she never
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" title="252"> </a>
lost an opportunity of repeating the wild gallop she had
started on their first ride; and as Klaus Heinrich, stimulated
by her gibes, urged the amazed and disapproving Florian to
the top of his speed, so as not to be left behind, the gallop
always degenerated into a race, which Imma Spoelmann
always started at unexpected and arbitrary moments. Several
of these struggles took place on the lonely river-edged causeway,
and one in particular was long and bitter. It happened
after a short talk about Klaus Heinrich's popularity, which
was begun brusquely, and broken off as brusquely, by Imma
Spoelmann. She asked suddenly: &ldquo;Is it true what I hear,
Prince, that you are so tremendously popular with the people?
That you have won all their hearts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered: &ldquo;So they say. It must be some characteristics,
not necessarily good ones. What's more, I'm not
sure whether I believe it, or even ought to be glad of it. I
doubt whether it speaks for me. My brother, the Grand
Duke, declares in so many words that popularity is hog-wash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm, the Grand Duke must be a fine man: I've got a great
respect for him. So we see you in an atmosphere of adulation,
and everybody loves you &hellip; go on!&rdquo; she cried suddenly,
and gave Fatma a cut with her white switch. The mare started,
and the race began.</p>

<p>It lasted a long time. Never before had they followed
the stream so far. The view on the left had long become
shut in. Lumps of earth and grass flew from under the
horses' hoofs. The Countess had soon dropped behind. When
at last they reined in their horses, Florian was trembling with
exhaustion, and the riders themselves were pale and panting.
They rode back in silence.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich received a visit at the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; from
Raoul Ueberbein the afternoon before his birthday this year.
The Doctor came to wish him many happy returns, as he
expected to be prevented by his work from doing so on the
morrow. They strolled round the gravel path at the back
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" title="253"> </a>
of the park, the tutor in his frock-coat and white tie, Klaus
Heinrich in his summer coat. The grass stood ready for
cutting under the perpendicular rays of the midday sun, and
the limes were in flower. In one corner, close by the hedge
which divided the park from the unlovely suburbs, stood a
little rustic temple.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was telling of his visits to &ldquo;Delphinenort,&rdquo;
as this topic lay nearest his heart. He spoke quite clearly
about them, but did not tell the doctor any actual news,
for the latter showed that he knew all about them. How
was that? Oh, from various sources. Ueberbein had never
started the subject. So people in the town concern themselves
about it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid, Klaus Heinrich, that anybody should give
a thought to it, either to the rides, or to the teas, or to the
motor drive. You don't suppose that that sort of thing
is expected to set tongues wagging!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we're so careful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo; is rich, Klaus Heinrich, and so is the carefulness.
All the same, his Excellency von Knobelsdorff keeps himself
accurately posted in all your goings-on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knobelsdorff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knobelsdorff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was silent; then asked: &ldquo;And what is
Baron Knobelsdorff's attitude towards what he learns?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the old gentleman hasn't yet had a chance of interfering
in the developments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the public opinion?&mdash;the people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people of course hold their breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, you yourself, my dear Doctor Ueberbein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm waiting for the tureen-lid,&rdquo; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Klaus Heinrich joyfully. &ldquo;No, there'll be no
tureen-lid this time, Doctor Ueberbein, for I am happy, oh
so happy, whatever happens&mdash;can you understand? You
taught me that happiness was no concern of mine, and you
pulled me up short when I tried to come by it; and right
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" title="254"> </a>
thankful I was to you for doing so, for it was horrible, and
I shall never forget it. But this is no case of high jinks at
a citizens' dance, which leave one humiliated and heavy at
heart; this is no breaking out and running off the rails and
humiliation! For can't you see that she of whom we are
speaking belongs neither to the citizens' dance, nor to the
aristocratic &lsquo;Pheasants,&rsquo; nor to anything in the world but to
me&mdash;that she is a Princess, Doctor Ueberbein, and as good
as me, and there can be no question here of a tureen-lid?
You have taught me that it is silly to maintain that we're
all only ordinary men, and hopeless for me to act as if we
were, and that the happiness I would gain by doing so is
forbidden to me and must bring me to shame in the end.
But this is not that silly and forbidden happiness. It is my
first taste of the happiness which is allowed me, and which I
may hope for, Doctor Ueberbein, and yield myself to without
misgiving, whatever comes of it&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Prince Klaus Heinrich,&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein,
though he did not at once leave him, but continued walking at
his side with his hands clasped behind him and his red
beard sunk on his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;No, not good-bye, Doctor
Ueberbein. That's just it. I mean to remain your friend,
you who have had such a hard time, and have shown such
pride in your duty and destiny, and have made me proud too
in treating me as a companion. I have no intention of resting
on my oars, now that I have found happiness, but will
remain true to you and to myself and to my exalted calling&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein in Latin, and shook
his ugly head with its protruding, pointed ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can be, Doctor. I'm sure it can, they're not incompatible.
And you, you ought not to show yourself so cold
and distant at my side, when I am so happy, and, what's
more, it's the eve of my birthday. Tell me&mdash;you've had so
many experiences and seen so much of the world in all its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" title="255"> </a>
aspects&mdash;have you never had any experiences in this direction?
You know what I mean&mdash;have you never had an attack like
this of mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; said Doctor Ueberbein, and pressed his lips together,
till his red beard rose, and the muscles knotted in
his cheeks. &ldquo;No doubt I may have had one once, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so! Tell me about it, Doctor Ueberbein. You
must tell me about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hour was one of quiet sunshine, and the air full of
the scent of limes. So Doctor Ueberbein related an incident
in his career on which he had never touched in previous
accounts, though it had perhaps a decisive influence on his
whole life. It had occurred in those early days when the
Doctor was teacher of the young idea and at the same time
working on his own account, when he used to draw in his
waist-belt and give private lessons to sleek tradesmen's
children, so as to get money to buy books with. With his
hands still behind him and his beard sunk on his breast, the
doctor related the incident in a sharp and incisive tone of
voice, pressing his lips close together between each sentence.</p>

<p>At that date fate had forged the closest ties between him
and a woman, a lovely, fair lady who was the wife of an
honourable and respected man and the mother of three
children. He had entered the family as tutor to the children,
but had subsequently been a constant guest and visitor, and
with the husband too had reached a footing of mutual confidences.
The feelings of the young tutor and the fair wife
for each other had been long unsuspected, and longer still
unexpressed in words; but they grew stronger in the silence,
and more overpowering, till one evening hour when the husband
had stayed late at his office, a warm, sweet, dangerous
hour, they burst into flames and were near to overwhelm them.</p>

<p>In that hour their longing had cried aloud for the happiness,
the tremendous happiness, of their union; but, said
Doctor Ueberbein, the world could sometimes show a noble
action. They felt ashamed, he said, to tread the mean and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" title="256"> </a>
ridiculous path of treachery, and to &ldquo;clap horns,&rdquo; as the
phrase goes, on the honest husband; while to spoil his life
by demanding release from him as the right of passion was
equally not to their taste. In short, for the children's sake
and for that of the good, honest husband, whom they both
respected, they denied themselves. Yes, that's what happened,
but of course it needed a good deal of stern resolution.
Ueberbein continued to visit the fair lady's house occasionally.
He would sup there, when he had time, play a game of cards
with his two friends, kiss his hostess's hand, and say good
night.</p>

<p>But when he had told the Prince this much, he concluded
in a still shorter and sharper tone than he had begun, and
the balls of muscle at the corners of his mouth showed more
prominently than before. For the hour which saw their act
of renunciation, in that hour Ueberbein had said a final
farewell to all happiness&mdash;&ldquo;dalliance with happiness,&rdquo; as he
had since called it. As he failed, or refused, to win the fair
lady, he swore to himself that he would honour her, and the
bonds which bound him to her, by achieving something and
making himself felt in the field of hard work. To this he
had dedicated his life, to this alone, and it had brought him
to what he was. That was the secret, or at least a contribution
of the riddle of Ueberbein's unsociability, unapproachableness,
and earnest endeavour. Klaus Heinrich was quite
frightened to see how unusually green his face was when he
took his leave with a deep bow, saying: &ldquo;My greetings to
little Imma, Klaus Heinrich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day the Prince received the congratulations of the
staff at the Schloss, and later those of Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf
and von Schulenburg-Tressen in the Yellow
Room. In the course of the morning the members of the
Grand Ducal House came to the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; to pay their
respects, and at one o'clock Klaus Heinrich drove to luncheon
with Prince and Princess zu Ried-Hohenried, meeting with an
unusually warm reception from the public on the way. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" title="257"> </a>
Grimmburgers were mustered in full force in the pretty
palace in the Albrechtstrasse. The Grand Duke too came, in
a frock-coat, nodded his small head to each member of the
party, sucking his lower lip against his upper the while, and
drank milk-and-soda during lunch. Almost immediately after
lunch was finished he withdrew. Prince Lambert had come
without his wife. The old habitué of the ballet was painted,
hollow-cheeked, and slovenly, and his voice sounded sepulchral.
He was to some extent ignored by his relations.</p>

<p>During luncheon the conversation turned for a while on
Court matters, then on little Princess Philippine's progress,
and later almost exclusively on Prince Philipp's commercial
schemes. The quiet little man talked about his breweries,
factories, and mills, and in particular about his peat-cuttings.
He described various improvements in the machinery, quoted
figures of capital invested and returns, and his cheeks glowed,
while his wife's relations listened to him with looks of
curiosity, approval, or mockery.</p>

<p>When coffee had been served in the big flower-room, the
Princess, holding her gilded cup, went up to her brother
and said: &ldquo;You have quite deserted us lately, Klaus Heinrich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ditlinde's face with the Grimmburg cheek-bones was not
so transparent as it had once been. It had gained more
colour since the birth of her daughter, and her head seemed
to be less oppressed by the weight of her fair hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I deserted you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forgive me, Ditlinde,
perhaps I have. But there were so many calls on my time,
and I knew that there were on yours too; for you are no
longer confined to flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, the flowers have had to take a less prominent place,
they don't get much thought from me now. A fairer life
and flowering now occupies all my time. I believe that's
where I have got my red cheeks from, like dear Philipp from
his peat (he ought not to have talked about it the whole of
luncheon, as he did; but it's his hobby), and it is because
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" title="258"> </a>
I was so busy and rushed that I was not cross with you for
never showing yourself and for going your own way, even
though that way seemed to me rather a surprising one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it is, Ditlinde?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, though unfortunately not from you. But Jettchen
<ins title="Isenschnibble">Isenschnibbe</ins> has kept me well posted&mdash;you know she is
always a fund of news&mdash;and at first I was horribly shocked,
I don't deny it. But after all they live in Delphinenort,
he has a private physician, and Philipp thinks they are in
their way of equal birth with ourselves. I believe I once
spoke disparagingly about them, Klaus Heinrich; I said something
about a Cr&oelig;sus, if I remember rightly, and made a pun
on the word &lsquo;taxpayer.&rsquo; But if you consider them worthy of
your friendship, I've been wrong and of course withdraw my
remarks, and will try to think differently about them in
future. I promise you. You always loved rummaging,&rdquo; she
went on, after he had laughed and kissed her hand, &ldquo;and
I had to do it with you, and my dress (do you remember it&mdash;the
red velvet?) suffered for it. Now you have to rummage
alone, and God grant, Klaus Heinrich, that it won't bring
you any horrible experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really believe, Ditlinde, that every experience is fine,
whether it be good or bad. But my present experience is
splendid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At half-past five the Prince left the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; again,
in his dogcart, which he drove himself, with a groom at his
back. It was warm, and Klaus Heinrich was wearing white
trousers with a double-breasted coat. Bowing, he again drove
to the town, or more precisely to the Old Schloss. He did
not enter the Albrechtstor, however, but drove in through a
side door, and across two courtyards till he reached that in
which the rose-bush grew.</p>

<p>Here all was still and stony; the stair-turrets with their
oblique windows, forged-iron balustrades, and fine carvings
towered in the corners; the many-styled building stood there
in light and shadow, partly grey and weather-worn, partly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_259" title="259"> </a>
more modern-looking, with gables and box-like projections,
with open porticoes and peeps through broad bow-windows
into vaulted halls and narrow galleries. But in the middle,
in its unfenced bed, stood the rose-bush, blooming gloriously
after a favourable season.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich threw the reins to a servant, and went up
and looked at the dark-red roses. They were exceptionally
fine&mdash;full and velvety, grandly formed, and a real masterwork
of nature. Several were already full-blown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call Ezekiel, please,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich to a moustachioed
door-keeper, who came forward with his hand to his
hat.</p>

<p>Ezekiel, the custodian of the rose-bush, came. He was a
greybeard of seventy years of age, in a gardener's apron,
with watery eyes and a bent back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any shears by you, Ezekiel?&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich,
&ldquo;I should like a rose.&rdquo; And Ezekiel drew some shears
out of the pocket of his apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one there,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;that's the finest.&rdquo;
And the old man cut the thorny branch with trembling hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll water it, Royal Highness,&rdquo; he said, and shuffled off
to the water-tap in a corner of the court. When he came
back, glittering drops were clinging to the petals of the rose,
as if to the feathers of waterfowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Ezekiel,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, and took the rose.
&ldquo;Still going strong? Here!&rdquo; He gave the old man a gold
piece, and climbing into the dogcart drove with the rose on
the seat beside him through the courtyards. Everybody who
saw him thought that he was driving back to the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo;
from the Old Schloss, where presumably he had an interview
with the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>But he drove through the Town Gardens to Delphinenort.
The sky had clouded over, big drops were already falling on
the leaves, and thunder rolled in the distance.</p>

<p>The ladies were at tea when Klaus Heinrich, conducted
by the corpulent butler, appeared in the gallery and walked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" title="260"> </a>
down the steps into the garden room. Mr. Spoelmann, as
usual recently, was not present. He was in bed with poultices
on. Percival, who lay curled up like a snail close by Imma's
chair, beat the carpet with his tail by way of greeting. The
gilding of the furniture looked dull, as the park beyond the
glass door lay in a damp mist.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich exchanged a handshake with the daughter
of the house, and kissed the Countess's hand, while he gently
raised her from the courtly curtsey she had begun, as usual,
to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, summer has come,&rdquo; he said to Imma Spoelmann,
offering her the rose. It was the first time he had brought
her flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How courtly of you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thanks, Prince. And
what a beauty!&rdquo; she went on in honest admiration (a thing
she hardly ever showed), and held out her small, ringless
hands for the glorious flower, whose dewy petals curled exquisitely
at the edges. &ldquo;Are there such fine roses here?
Where did you get it?&rdquo; And she bent her dark head eagerly
over it.</p>

<p>Her eyes were full of horror when she looked up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't smell!&rdquo; she said, and a look of disgust showed
round her mouth. &ldquo;Wait, though&mdash;it smells of decay!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;What's this you have brought me, Prince?&rdquo; And
her big black eyes in her pale face seemed to glow with
questioning horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm sorry; that's a way our roses have.
It's from the bush in one of the courts of the Old Schloss.
Have you never heard of it? There's something hangs by
that. People say that one day it will begin to smell exquisite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed not to be listening to him. &ldquo;It seems as if
it had no soul,&rdquo; she said, and looked at the rose. &ldquo;But it's
perfectly beautiful, that one must allow. Well, that's a
doubtful joke on nature's part, Prince. All the same, Prince,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" title="261"> </a>
thanks for your attention. And as it comes from your
ancestral Schloss, one must regard it with due reverence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put the rose in a glass by her plate. A swan's-down
flunkey brought the Prince a cup and plate. They discussed
at tea the bewitched rose-bush, and then commonplace subjects,
such as the Court Theatre, their horses, and all sorts of
trivial topics. Imma Spoelmann time after time contradicted
him, interposing polished quotations&mdash;to her own enjoyment,
and his despair at the range of her reading&mdash;quotations which
she uttered in her broken voice, with whimsical motions of
her head. After a time a heavy, white-paper parcel was
brought in, sent by the book-binders to Miss Spoelmann, containing
a number of works which she had had bound in smart
and durable bindings. She opened the parcel, and they all
three examined the books to see if the binder had done his
work well.</p>

<p>They were nearly all learned works whose contents were
either as mysterious-looking as Imma Spoelmann's notebook,
or dealt with scientific psychology, acute analyses of internal
impulses. They were got up in the most sumptuous way, with
parchment and crushed leather, gold letters, fine paper, and
silk markers. Imma Spoelmann did not display much enthusiasm
over the consignment, but Klaus Heinrich, who had
never seen such handsome volumes, was full of admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you put them all into the bookcase?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;With the others upstairs? I suppose you have quantities of
books? Are they all as fine as these? Do let me see how
you arrange them. I can't go yet, the weather's still bad and
would ruin my white trousers. Besides, I've no idea how you
live in Delphinenort, I've never seen your study. Will you
show me your books?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on the Countess,&rdquo; she said, busying herself
with piling the volumes one on the other. &ldquo;Countess, the
Prince wants to see my books. Would you be so kind as to
say what you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" title="262"> </a>Countess Löwenjoul was in a brown study. With her small
head bent, she was watching Klaus Heinrich with a sharp,
almost hostile look, and then let her eyes wander to Imma
Spoelmann, when her expression altered and became gentle,
sympathetic, and anxious. She came to herself with a smile,
and drew a little watch out of her brown, close-fitting dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At seven o'clock,&rdquo; she said brightly, &ldquo;Mr. Spoelmann
expects you to read to him, Imma. You have half an hour
in which to do what his Royal Highness wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good; come along, Prince, and inspect my study,&rdquo; said
Imma. &ldquo;And so far as your Highness permits it, please lend
a hand in carrying up these books; I'll take half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Klaus Heinrich took them all. He clasped them in
both arms, though the left was not much use to him, and
the pile reached to his chin. Then, bending backwards and
going carefully, so as to drop nothing, he followed Imma
over into the wing towards the drive, on the main floor of
which lay Countess Löwenjoul's and Miss Spoelmann's quarters.</p>

<p>In the big, comfortable room which they entered through
a heavy door he laid his burden down on the top of a
hexagonal ebony table, which stood in front of a big gold-chintzed
sofa. Imma Spoelmann's study was not furnished
in the style proper to the Schloss, but in more modern taste,
without any show, but with massive, masculine, serviceable
luxury. It was panelled with rare woods right up to the
top, and adorned with old porcelain, which glittered on the
brackets all round under the ceiling. The carpets were
Persian, the mantelpiece black marble, on which stood shapely
vases and a gilt clock. The chairs were broad and velvet-covered,
and the curtains of the same golden stuff as the
sofa-cover. A capacious desk stood in front of the bow-window,
which allowed a view of the big basin in front of
the Schloss. One wall was covered with books, but the main
library was in the adjacent room, which was smaller, and
carpeted like the big one. A glass door opened into it, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" title="263"> </a>
its walls were completely covered with bookshelves right up
to the ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Prince, there's my hermitage,&rdquo; said Imma Spoelmann.
&ldquo;I hope you like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it's glorious,&rdquo; he said. But he did not look round
him, but gazed unintermittently at her, as she reclined against
the sofa cushions by the hexagonal table. She was wearing
one of her beautiful indoor dresses, a summer one this time,
made of white accordion-pleated stuff, with open sleeves and
gold embroidery on the yoke. The skin of her arms and neck
seemed brown as meerschaum against the white of the dress;
her big, bright, earnest eyes in the strangely childlike face
seemed to speak a language of their own unceasingly, and a
smooth wisp of black hair hung across her forehead. She had
Klaus Heinrich's rose in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; he said, standing before her, and not conscious
of what he meant. His blue eyes, above the national
cheek-bones, were heavy as with grief. &ldquo;You have as many
books,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as my sister Ditlinde has flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the Princess so many flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but of late she has not set so much store by them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's clear these away,&rdquo; she said and took up some books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, wait,&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;I've such a lot to say to
you, and our time is so short. You must know that to-day
is my birthday&mdash;that's why I came and brought you the rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is an event. Your birthday to-day?
Well, I'm sure that you received all your congratulations
with the dignity you always show. You may have mine as
well! It was sweet of you to bring me the rose, although
it has its doubtful side.&rdquo; And she tried the mouldy smell
once more with an expression of fear on her face. &ldquo;How old
are you to-day, Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I was born twenty-seven
years ago in the Grimmburg. Ever since then I've had a
strenuous and lonely time of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer. And suddenly he saw her eyes, under
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" title="264"> </a>
her slightly frowning eye-brows, move to his side. Yes,
although he was standing sideways to her with his right
shoulder towards her, as he had trained himself to do, he
could not prevent her eyes fastening on his left arm, on the
hand which he had planted right back on his hip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you born with that?&rdquo; she asked softly.</p>

<p>He grew pale. But with a cry, which rang like a cry
of redemption, he sank down before her, and clasped her
wondrous form in both his arms. There he lay, in his
white trousers and his blue and red coat with the major's
shoulder-straps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;little sister<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered with a pout: &ldquo;Think of appearances, Prince.
I consider that one should not let oneself go, but should keep
up appearances on all occasions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he was too far gone, and raising his face to her, his eyes
in a mist, he only said, &ldquo;Imma&mdash;little Imma<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she took his hand, the left, atrophied one, the deformity,
the hindrance in his lofty calling, which he had
been wont from boyhood to hide artfully and carefully&mdash;she
took it and kissed it.</p>

<small>THE FULFILMENT</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Grave</span> reports were flying around concerning the state of
health of the Finance Minister, Doctor Krippenreuther.
People hinted at nervous break-down, at a progressive stomach-trouble,
which indeed Herr Krippenreuther's flabby yellow
complexion was calculated to suggest&hellip;. What is Greatness?
The daily-breader, the journeyman, might envy this
tortured dignitary his title, his chain, his rank at Court, his
important office, to which he had climbed so pertinaciously,
only to wear himself out in it: but not when these all meant
the concomitant of his illness. His retirement was repeatedly
announced to be impending. It was said to be due simply
and solely to the Grand Duke's dislike of new faces, as well
as to the consideration that matters could not be improved by
a change of personnel, that his resignation had not already
become a fact. Dr. Krippenreuther had spent his summer
leave in a health-resort in the hills. Perhaps he might have
improved somewhat up there. But anyhow after his return
his recouped strength ebbed away quickly again. For at the
very beginning of the Parliamentary session a rift had come
between him and the Budget Commission&mdash;serious dissensions,
which were certainly not from any want of industry on his
part, but from the circumstances, from the incurable position
of affairs.</p>

<p>In the middle of September Albrecht&nbsp;II opened the Landtag
in the Old Schloss with the traditional ceremonies. They
began with an invocation to God by the Court Chaplain, Dom
Wislezenus, in the Schloss Chapel. Then the Grand Duke,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" title="266"> </a>
accompanied by Prince Klaus Heinrich, went in solemn procession
to the Throne-room. Here the members of both
Chambers, the Ministers, Court officials, and many others in
uniform and civil dress greeted the royal brothers with three
cheers, led by the President of the First Chamber, a Count
Prenzlau.</p>

<p>Albrecht had earnestly wished to transfer to his brother
his duties in the formal ceremony. It was only owing to the
urgent objections of Herr von Knobelsdorff that he walked
in the procession behind the pages. He was so much ashamed
of his braided hussar's coat, his gaudy trousers, and the
whole to-do, that he showed clearly in his face his anger and
his embarrassment. His shoulder-blades were twisted in his
nervousness as he mounted the steps to the throne. Then he
took his stand in front of the theatrical chair under the
faded baldachin, and sucked at his upper lip. His small,
bearded, unmilitary head rested on the white collar, which
stuck out far above the silver hussar-collar, and his blue,
lonely-looking eyes gazed vacantly in front of him. The
jangle of the spurs of the aide-de-camp who handed him the
manuscript of his Speech from the Throne rang through the
hall, in which silence now reigned. And quietly, with a slight
lisp, and more than one sudden burst of coughing, the Grand
Duke read what had been written for him.</p>

<p>The speech was the most palliatory that had ever been
heard, each humiliating fact from outside being counter-balanced
by some virtuous trait or other in the people. He
began by praising the industrious spirit of the whole country;
then admitted that there was no actual increase to show in
any branch of manufacture, so that the sources of revenue
failed to show under any head the fertility that could be
desired. He remarked with satisfaction how the feeling for
the public good and economical self-sacrifice were spreading
more and more through the population; and then declared
without mincing matters that &ldquo;notwithstanding a general most
acceptable increase in the taxation returns as the result of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" title="267"> </a>
influx of wealthy foreigners&rdquo; (meaning Mr. Spoelmann) &ldquo;any
relaxation of the calls on the said noble self-sacrifice was not
to be thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even without this, he continued, it had been impossible to
budget for all the objects of the financial policy, and should
it prove that sufficient reduction in the public debt had not
been successfully provided for, the Government considered
that the continuation of policy of moderate loans would prove
the best way out of the financial complications. In any
event it&mdash;the Government&mdash;felt itself supported in these most
unfavourable circumstances by the confidence of the nation,
that faith in the future which was so fair a heritage of our
stock&hellip;. And the Speech from the Throne left the sinister
topic of public economy as soon as possible, to apply itself to
less disputatious subjects, such as ecclesiastical, educational,
and legal matters. Minister of State von Knobelsdorff
declared in the monarch's name the Landtag to be open. And
the cheers which accompanied Albrecht when he left the hall
sounded somewhat ironical and dubious.</p>

<p>As the weather was still summery, he went straight back
to Hollerbrunn, from which necessity alone had driven him
to the capital. He had done his part, and the rest was the
concern of Herr Krippenreuther and the Landtag. Quarrels
began, as has been said, immediately, and about several topics
at once: the property tax, the meat tax, and the Civil Service
estimates.</p>

<p>For, when the deputies proved adamant against attempts
to persuade them to sanction fresh taxes, Doctor Krippenreuther's
meditative mind had hit on the idea of converting
the income tax which had been usual hitherto into a property
tax, which on the basis of 13½ per cent. would produce an
increment of about a million. How direly needed, indeed
how inadequate such an increment was, was clear from the
main budget for the new financial year, which, leaving out
of account the imposition of new burdens on the Treasury,
concluded with an adverse balance, which was calculated to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" title="268"> </a>
damp the courage of any economical expert. But when it
was realized that practically only the towns would be hit by
the property tax, the combined indignation of the urban
deputies turned against the assessment of 13½ per cent., and
they demanded as compensation at least the abolition of the
meat tax, which they called undemocratic and antediluvian.
Add to this that the Commission adhered resolutely to the long
promised and always postponed improvement of Civil servants'
pay&mdash;for it could not be denied that the salaries of the
Government officials, clergy, and teachers of the Grand Duchy
were miserable.</p>

<p>But Doctor Krippenreuther could not make gold&mdash;he said
in so many words, &ldquo;I've never learnt to make gold,&rdquo; and
he found himself equally unable to abolish the meat tax and
to ameliorate the conditions in the Civil Service. His only
resource was to anchor himself to his 13½ per cent., although
no one knew better than he that its sanction would not really
bring things any nearer their solution. For the position was
serious, and despondent spirits painted it in gloomy colours.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Almanac of the Grand Ducal Statistical Bureau&rdquo; contained
alarming returns of the harvest for the last year.
Agriculture had a succession of bad years to show; storms,
hail, droughts, and inordinate rain had been the lot of the
peasants; an exceptionally cold and snowless winter had resulted
in the seed freezing; and the critics maintained, though
with little proof to show for it, that the timber-cutting had
already influenced the climate. At any rate figures proved
that the total yield of corn had decreased in a most disquieting
degree. The straw, besides being deficient in quantity,
left much to be wished from the point of view of quality, in
the opinion of the compilers of the report.</p>

<p>The figures of the potato harvest fell far below the average
of the preceding decade, not to mention that no less than
10 per cent. of the potatoes were diseased. As to artificial
feeding-stuffs, these showed for the last two years results both
in quality and quantity which, for clover and manure, were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" title="269"> </a>
as bad as the worst of the years under review, and things were
no better with the rapeseed harvest or with the first and second
hay crops. The decline in agriculture was baldly shown in
the increase of forced sales, whose figures in the year under
review had advanced in a striking way. But the failure of
crops entailed a falling off in the produce of taxation which
would have been regrettable in any country, but in ours could
not help having a fatal effect.</p>

<p>As to the forests, nothing had been made out of them.
One disaster had followed another; blight and moths had
attacked the woods more than once. And it will be remembered
that owing to over-cutting the woods had lost seriously
in capital value.</p>

<p>The silver-mines? They had for a long time proved barren.
The work had been interrupted by convulsions of nature,
and as the repairs would have cost large sums, and the results
had never showed signs of coming up to expectations, it had
been found necessary provisionally to suspend the workings,
though this threw a number of labourers out of work and
caused distress in whole districts.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to explain how matters stood with
the ordinary State revenues in this time of trial. The slowly
advancing crisis, the deficit carried forward from one year to
another, had become burning owing to the straits of the people
and the unfavourableness of the elements. It had begun to
cry aloud for remedy, and, when one looked around despairingly
for the remedy, or even for means of alleviation, the
most purblind could not fail to see the whole hideousness of
our financial condition. There could be no thought of voting
for new expenditure, the country was naturally incapable
of bearing much taxation. It was now exhausted, its tax-paying
powers adversely affected, and the critics declared that
the sight of insufficiently nourished human beings was becoming
more and more common in the country. They attributed
this firstly to the shocking taxes on provisions and secondly
to the direct taxation which was known to oblige stock-owners
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" title="270"> </a>
to turn all their full-milk into cash. As to the other less
respectable though enticingly easy remedy for dearth of money,
of which the financial authorities were well aware, namely
the raising of a loan, the time was come when an improper
and inconsiderate use of this means must begin to bring its
own bitter punishment.</p>

<p>The liquidation of the national debt had been taken in
hand for a time in a clumsy and harmful way. Then under
Albrecht&nbsp;II it had stopped altogether. The yawning rifts in
the State had received an emergency stuffing of new loans
and paper issues, and subsequent Finance Ministers had grown
pale to find themselves faced with a floating consolidated
debt redeemable at an early date, whose total was scandalously
large for the total number of heads of the population.</p>

<p>Dr. Krippenreuther had not shrunk from the practical steps
open to the State in such a predicament. He had steered clear
of big capital obligations, had demanded compulsory redemption
of bonds, and, while reducing the rate of interest,
had converted short-dated debts over the heads of the creditors
into perpetual rent-charges. But these rent-charges had
to be paid; and while this incumbrance was an unbearable
burden on the national economy, the lowness of the rate of
exchange caused every fresh issue of bonds to bring in less
capital proceeds to the Treasury. Still more: the economic
crisis in the Grand Duchy had the effect of making foreign
creditors demand payments at an exceptionally early date.
This again lowered the rate of exchange and resulted in an
increased flow of gold out of the country, and bank-smashes
were daily occurrences in the business world.</p>

<p>In a word: our credit was shattered, our paper stood far
below its nominal value; and though the Landtag might
perhaps have preferred to vote a new loan to voting new
taxes, the conditions which would have been imposed upon
the country were such that the negotiation seemed difficult,
if not impossible. For on the top of everything else came
this unpleasant factor, that the people were at that moment
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" title="271"> </a>
suffering from the burden of that general economical disorder,
that appreciation in the price of gold, which is still
vivid in everybody's memory.</p>

<p>What was to be done to get safe to land? Whither turn
to appease the hunger for gold which was devouring us?
The disposal of the then unproductive silver-mines and the
application of the proceeds to the payment of the debts at
high interest was discussed at length. Yet, as matters stood,
the sale could not help turning out disadvantageously. Further,
not only would the State lose altogether the capital sunk
in the mines, but would relinquish its prospect of a return
which might perhaps sooner or later materialize. Finally,
buyers did not grow on every bush. For one moment&mdash;a
moment of psychical despondency&mdash;the sale of the national
forests even was mooted. But it must be said that there was
still sense enough in the country to prevent our woods being
surrendered to private industry.</p>

<p>To complete the picture: still further rumours of sales were
current, rumours which suggested that the financial embarrassment
penetrated even to quarters which the loyal people
had always hoped were far removed from all the rubs of the
time. The <i>Courier</i>, which was never used to sacrifice a piece
of news to its sympathetic feelings, was the first to publish
the news that two of the Grand Duke's schlosses, &ldquo;Pastime&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Favourite,&rdquo; in the open country, had been put up for
sale. Considering that neither property was of any further
use as a residence for the royal family, and that both demanded
yearly increasing outlay, the administrators of the
Crown trust property had given notice in the proper quarter
for steps to be taken to sell them: what did that imply?</p>

<p>It was obviously quite a different case from that of the
sale of Delphinenort, which had been the result of a quite
exceptional and favourable offer, as well as a smart stroke
of business on behalf of the State. People who were brutal
enough to give a name to things which finer feeling shrinks
from specifying, declared right out that the Treasury had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" title="272"> </a>
been mercilessly set on by disquieted creditors, and that their
consent to such sales showed that they were exposed to relentless
pressure.</p>

<p>How far had matters gone? Into whose hands would the
schlosses fall? The more benevolent who asked this question
were inclined to find comfort in and to believe a further
report, which was spread by the wiseacres; namely, that on
this occasion too the buyer was no one else but Samuel
Spoelmann&mdash;an entirely groundless and fantastic report, which,
however, proves what a rôle in the world of popular imagination
was played by the lonely, suffering little man who had
settled down in such princely style in their midst.</p>

<p>Yonder he lived, with his physician, his electric organ, and
his collection of glass, behind the pillars, the bow windows,
and the chiselled festoons of the schloss which had risen from
its ruins at a nod from him. He was hardly ever seen: he
was always in bed with poultices. But people saw his daughter,
that curious creature with the whimsical features who
lived like a princess, had a countess for a companion, studied
algebra, and had walked in a temper unimpeded right through
the guard. People saw her, and they sometimes saw Prince
Klaus Heinrich at her side.</p>

<p>Raoul Ueberbein had used a strong expression when he declared
that the public &ldquo;held their breath&rdquo; at the sight. But
he really was right, and it can be truly said that the population
of our town as a whole never followed a social or
public proceeding with such passionate, such surpassing eagerness
as Klaus Heinrich's visits to Delphinenort. The Prince
himself acted up to a certain point&mdash;namely up to a certain
conversation with his Excellency the Minister of State, Knobelsdorff&mdash;blindly,
without regard to the outside world and in
obedience only to an inner impulse. But his tutor was justified
in deriding in his fatherly way his idea that his proceedings
could be kept hid from the world. For whether it
was that the servants on both sides did not hold their tongues,
or that the public had the opportunity of direct observation, at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" title="273"> </a>
any rate Klaus Heinrich had not met Miss Spoelmann once
since that first meeting in the Dorothea Hospital, without its
being remarked and discussed. Remarked? No, spied on,
glared at, and greedily jumped at! Discussed? Rather
smothered in floods of talk.</p>

<p>The intercourse of the two was the topic of conversation in
Court circles, salons, sitting- and bedrooms, barbers' shops,
public-houses, workrooms, and servants' halls, by cabmen on
the ranks and girls at the gates. It occupied the minds of men
no less than women, of course with the variations which are
inherent in the different ways the sexes have of looking at
things. The always sympathetic interest in it had a uniting,
levelling effect: it bridged over the social gaps, and one might
hear the tram conductor turn to the smart passenger on the
platform with the question whether he knew that yesterday
afternoon the Prince had again spent an hour at Delphinenort.</p>

<p>But what was at once remarkable in itself and at the same
time decisive for the future was that throughout there never
seemed for one moment to be any feeling of scandal in the air,
nor did all the tongue-wagging seem merely the vulgar pleasure
in startling events in high quarters. From the very beginning,
before any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrière pensée</i> had had time to form, the
thousand-voiced discussion of the subject, however animated,
was always pitched in a key of approval and agreement. Indeed,
the Prince, if it had occurred to him at an earlier stage
to adapt his conduct to public opinion, would have realized
at once to his delight how entirely popular that conduct was.
For when he called Miss Spoelmann a &ldquo;princess&rdquo; to his tutor,
he had, quite properly, accurately expressed his people's
mind&mdash;that people which always surrounds the uncommon and
visionary with a cloud of poetry.</p>

<p>Yes, to the people the pale, dark, precious, and strangely
lovely creature of mixed blood, who had come to us from the
Antipodes to live her lonely and unprecedented life amongst
us&mdash;to the people she was a princess&mdash;or Fairy-child from
Fableland, a princess in the world's most wonderful meaning.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" title="274"> </a>
But everything, her own behaviour as much as the attitude
of the world towards her, contributed to make her appear a
princess in the ordinary sense of the word also. Did she
not live with her companion countess in a schloss, as was
meet and right? Did she not drive in her gorgeous motor
or her four-in-hand to the benevolent institutions, the homes
for the blind, for orphans, and for deaconesses, the public
kitchens and the milk-kitchens, to teach herself and to stimulate
them by her inspection, like a complete princess?</p>

<p>Had she not subscribed to support the victims of flood and
fire out of her &ldquo;privy purse,&rdquo; as the <i>Courier</i> was precise
enough to declare, subscriptions which nearly equalled those
of the Grand Duke (did not exceed them, as was noticed with
general satisfaction)? Did not the newspapers publish
almost daily, immediately under the Court news, reports of
Mr. Spoelmann's varying health&mdash;whether the colic kept him
in bed or whether he had resumed his morning visits to the
Spa-gardens? Were not the white liveries of his servants as
much a part of the picture in the streets of the capital as the
brown of the Grand Ducal lackeys? Did not foreigners with
guide-books ask to be taken out to Delphinenort, there to
gloat over the sight of Spoelmann's house&mdash;many of them before
they had seen the Old Schloss?</p>

<p>Were not both Schlosses, the Old and Delphinenort, about
equally centres and foci of the city? To what circle of
society belonged that human being who had been born
Samuel Spoelmann's daughter, that creature without counterpart,
without analogy? To whom should she attach herself,
with whom have intercourse? Nothing could be less surprising,
nothing more obvious and natural than to see Klaus
Heinrich at her side. And even those who had never enjoyed
that sight enjoyed it in the spirit and gloated over it: the slim,
solemnly familiar figure of the Prince by the side of the
daughter and heiress of the prodigious little foreigner, who,
ill and peevish as he was, disposed of a fortune which
amounted to nearly twice as much as our national debt!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" title="275"> </a>Then one day a memory, a wonderful disposition of words,
took hold of the public conscience; nobody can say who
first pointed to it, recalled it&mdash;that is quite uncertain. Perhaps
it was a woman, perhaps a child with credulous eyes, whom
somebody was sending to sleep with stories&mdash;heaven only
knows. But a ghostly form began to show liveliness in the
popular imagination: the shadow of an old gipsy-woman,
grey and bent, with an inward squint, who drew her stick
through the sand, and whose mumbling had been written
down and handed down from generation to generation&hellip;.
&ldquo;The greatest happiness?&rdquo; It should come to the land
through a Prince &ldquo;with one hand.&rdquo; He would give the country,
the prophecy ran, more with his one hand than others
could with two&hellip;. With one? But was everything all
right with Klaus Heinrich's slim figure?</p>

<p>When one thought of it, was there not a weakness, a defect
in his person, which one always avoided seeing when addressing
him, partly from shyness, and partly because with
charming skill he made it so easy not to notice it? When
one saw him in his carriage, he kept his left hand on his
sword-hilt covered with his right. One could see him under a
baldachin, on a flag-bedecked platform, take up a position
slightly turned to the left, with his left hand planted somehow
on his hip. His left arm was too short, the hand was stunted,
everybody knew that, and knew various explanations of the
origin of the defect, although respect and distance had not
allowed a clear view of it or even its recognition in so many
words. But now everybody saw it. It could never be ascertained
who first whispered and quoted the prophecy in this
connexion&mdash;whether it was a child, or a girl, or a greybeard
on the threshold of the beyond.</p>

<p>But what is certain is, that it was the people who started it,
the people who imposed certain thoughts and hopes&mdash;and
quite soon their conception of Miss Spoelmann's personality&mdash;on
the cultured classes right up to the highest quarters,
and exercised a powerful influence on them from below: that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" title="276"> </a>
the impartial, unprejudiced belief of the people afforded the
broad and firm foundation for all that came later. &ldquo;With
one hand?&rdquo; people asked, and &ldquo;the greatest happiness?&rdquo;
They saw Klaus Heinrich in the spirit by Imma Spoelmann's
side with his left hand on his hip, and, still incompetent to
think their thought out to its conclusion, they quivered at
their half-thought.</p>

<p>At that time everything was still in the clouds, and nobody
thought anything out to its conclusion&mdash;not even the persons
most immediately concerned. For the relations between
Klaus Heinrich and Imma Spoelmann were wondrous strange,
and their minds&mdash;his as well&mdash;could not be brought to centre
on any immediate, palpable goal. As a matter of fact, that
laconic conversation on the afternoon of the Prince's birthday
(when Miss Spoelmann had showed him her books) had
made but the slightest, if any, alteration in their relations.
Klaus Heinrich may have gone back to the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; in
that condition of heated enthusiasm proper to young people
on such occasions, convinced that something decisive had
happened: but he soon learned that his wooing of what he
had recognized to be his only happiness was only now really
beginning.</p>

<p>But, as has been said, this wooing could not aim at any
objective result, a bourgeois promise or such-like&mdash;such an
idea was almost inconceivable, and besides the Prince lived
in too great seclusion from the practical world for such an
end to present itself to him. In fact the object of Klaus
Heinrich's pleadings with looks and words from that time
onward was not that Miss Spoelmann should reciprocate the
feelings he entertained towards her, but that she might feel
impelled to believe in the reality and liveliness of those feelings.
For that was what she did not do.</p>

<p>He let two weeks pass before he sent in his name at Delphinenort
again, and during these he feasted spiritually on
what had already occurred. He was in no hurry to supersede
that happening with a new one. Besides, his time just now
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" title="277"> </a>
was occupied by several representative functions, including
the annual festival of the Miniature Range Rifle Club, whose
well-informed patron he was and in whose anniversary festival
he annually took part. Here he was received in his green
uniform, as if his sole interest in life was rifle-shooting, by
the united members of the association with an enthusiastic
welcome, was conducted to the butts, and, after an unappetizing
luncheon with the distinguished members of the committee,
fired several shots in a gracefully expert attitude in
the direction of various targets.</p>

<p>When he proceeded&mdash;it was the middle of June&mdash;to pay
another afternoon visit to the Spoelmanns, he found Imma
in a very mocking mood, and her mode of expression was
unusually Scriptural and solemn. Mr. Spoelmann also was
present this time, and although his presence robbed Klaus
Heinrich of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> he so much desired with the daughter,
yet it helped him in a quite unexpected way to bear up
against the wounds which Imma's sharpness gave him; for
Samuel Spoelmann was friendly, and almost affectionate towards
him.</p>

<p>They had tea on the terrace, sitting in basket-chairs of an
ultra-modern shape, with the breezes from the flower-garden
softly fanning them. The master of the house lay under a
green-silk, fur-lined, and parrot-embroidered coverlet, stretched
by the table on a cane couch fitted with silk cushions. He
had left his bed for the sake of the mild air, but his cheeks
to-day were not inflamed, but of a sallow paleness, and his
eyes were muddy; his chin protruded sharply, his prominent
nose looked longer than ever, and his tone was not cross, as
usual, but sad&mdash;a bad sign. By his head sat Doctor Watercloose
with his continual soft smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, young Prince&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann in a
tired tone, and answered the other's inquiry as to his health
merely with half a grunt. Imma, in a shimmering dress
with a high waist and green-velvet bolero, poured water into
the pot out of the electric kettle. She congratulated the Prince
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" title="278"> </a>
with a pout on his personal prowess at the rifle festival. She
had, she said, as she wagged her head backwards and forwards,
&ldquo;read an account of it in the daily press with deep
satisfaction,&rdquo; and had read aloud the description of his exploits
as marksman to the Countess. The latter was sitting
bolt upright in her tight brown dress at the table, and
handling her spoon gracefully, without in any way letting
herself go. It was Mr. Spoelmann who did the talking this
time. He did it, as has been said, in a soft, sad way, the
result of all his suffering.</p>

<p>He recounted an occurrence, an experience of years gone
by, which was obviously still fresh to him, and which always
brought him new suffering on the days when his health was
bad. He recounted the short and simple story twice, with
even greater self-torture the second time than the first. He
had wished to make one of his endowments&mdash;not one of the
first rank, but a pretty considerable one&mdash;he had given a big
philanthropic institute in the United States to understand in
writing that he wished to devote a million in railway bonds
to the furtherance of their noble work&mdash;safe paper of the
South Pacific Railway, said Mr. Spoelmann, and slapped the
palm of his hand, as if to show the paper. But what had
the philanthropic institute done? It had refused the gift,
rejected it&mdash;adding in so many words that it preferred to go
without the support of questionable and ill-gotten plunder.
They had actually done that. Mr. Spoelmann's lips quivered
as he recounted it, the first time no less than the second, and,
longing for comfort and expressions of disapproval, he
looked round the table with his little, close-set, metallic eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not philanthropic of the philanthropic institute,&rdquo;
said Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;No, it certainly was not.&rdquo; And the
shake of his head was so decided, his disgust and sympathy so
obvious, that Mr. Spoelmann cheered up a little and declared
that it was lovely outside to-day and the trees down yonder
smelt nice. Indeed, he took the first opportunity of showing
his young guest his appreciation and satisfaction in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" title="279"> </a>
clearest manner. For Klaus Heinrich had caught a chill
with this summer's constant alternations between warm
weather and cooling showers and hailstorms. His neck was
swollen, his throat felt sore when he swallowed; and as his
lofty calling and a certain amount of molly-coddling of his
person, in request as it was for exhibition, had necessarily
made him rather delicate, he could not help alluding to it
and complaining of the pain in his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have wet compresses,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann.
&ldquo;Have you any oil-silk?&rdquo; Klaus Heinrich had none. Then
Mr. Spoelmann threw off the parrot coverlet, stood up, and
went inside the Schloss. He would not answer any questions,
insisted on going, and went. When he had gone, the others
asked each other what he intended to do, and Doctor Watercloose,
fearing lest an attack of pain had seized his patient,
hurried after him. But when Mr. Spoelmann returned he
had in his hand a piece of oil-silk, whose existence in some
drawer he had remembered: a rather creased piece, which
he handed to the Prince with precise directions how to use
it, so as to get the most good out of it. Klaus Heinrich
thanked him delightedly, and Mr. Spoelmann got contentedly
back on to his couch. This time he stayed there till the end
of tea, when he proposed a general walk round the park, in
the following order: Mr. Spoelmann in his soft slippers
between Imma and Klaus Heinrich, while Countess Löwenjoul
followed at a short distance with Dr. Watercloose.</p>

<p>When the Prince took leave for the day, Imma Spoelmann
made some sharp remark about his neck and the wet compresses,
adjured him half-mockingly to nurse himself and to
take the utmost care of his sacred person. But although
Klaus Heinrich had no adequate repartee ready for her&mdash;she
did not expect or want one&mdash;yet it was in a fairly cheerful
frame of mind that he mounted his dog-cart; for the
piece of creased oil-silk in the back pocket of his uniform
coat seemed to him, though unconsciously, a pledge of a
happy future.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" title="280"> </a>However that might be, for the present his struggle was
only beginning. It was the struggle for Imma Spoelmann's
faith, the struggle to make her so far trust him as to be
capable of deciding to leave the clear and frosty sphere
wherein she had been wont to play, to descend from the
realms of algebra and conversational ridicule, and to venture
with him into the untrodden zone, that warmer, more fragrant,
more fruitful zone to which he showed her the way. For she
was overpoweringly shy of making any such decision.</p>

<p>Next time he was alone with her, or as good as alone,
because Countess Löwenjoul was the third, it was a cool,
over-cast morning, after a break in the weather the night
before. They rode along the meadow-woods, Klaus Heinrich
in high boots, with the crook of his crop suspended between
the buttons of his grey cloak. The sluices at the wooden
bridge up stream were shut, the bed of the stream lay empty
and stony. Percival, whose first outburst had died down,
jumped here and there or trotted sideways, dog-fashion, in
front of the horses. The Countess, on Isabeau, kept her head
on one side and smiled. Klaus Heinrich was saying: &ldquo;I'm
always thinking, night and day, about something which must
have been a dream. I lie at night and can hear Florian over
in the stall snuffling, it's so quiet. And then I think, for
certain it was no dream. But when I see you as I do to-day,
and did the other day at tea, I cannot possibly think it
anything more substantial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replied: &ldquo;I must ask you to explain yourself, Sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you show me your books nineteen days ago, Miss
Spoelmann&mdash;or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nineteen days ago! I must count up. No; let's see, it's
eighteen and a half days, unless I'm quite out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did show me your books, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is undoubtedly correct, Prince. And I delude myself
with the hope that you liked them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Imma, you mustn't talk like that, not now and not
to me! My heart is so heavy, and I have such lots still to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" title="281"> </a>
say to you, which I couldn't get out nineteen days ago, when
you showed me your books &hellip; your masses of books. How
I should love to carry on where we broke off then, and to
forget all that lies in between&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven's sake, Prince, rather forget the other. Why
go back to it? Why remind yourself and me? I thought
you had good reason to observe the strictest silence on such
subjects. Fancy letting yourself go like that! Losing your
self-possession to such a degree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew, Imma, how unutterably pleasant it is
for me to lose my self-possession!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. That's insulting, do you know that? I insist
on your showing the same self-possession towards me as
towards the rest of the world. I'm not here to provide you
with relaxation from your princely existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How entirely you misunderstand me, Imma! But I am
well aware that you do so deliberately and only in fun, and
that shows me that you don't believe me and don't take what
I say seriously&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Prince, you really ask too much. Haven't you told
me about your life? You went to school for show, to the
University for show, you served as a soldier for show, and
still wear the uniform for show, you hold audiences for
show, and play at rifle-shooting and heaven knows what else
for show; you came into the world for show, and am I suddenly
to believe that there is anything serious about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears came to his eyes while she said this: her words hurt
him so much. He answered gently: &ldquo;You are right, Imma,
there is a lot of fiction in my life. But I didn't make it
or choose it, you must remember, but have done my duty
precisely and sternly as it was prescribed to me for the
edification of the people. And it is not enough that it has
been a hard one, and full of prohibitions and privations; it
must now take revenge on me, by causing you not to believe
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are proud,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of your calling and your life,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_282" title="282"> </a>
Prince, I know well, and I cannot wish you to break faith
with yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;leave that to me, that about being true
to myself, and don't give it a thought! I have had experiences,
I have been untrue to myself and have tried to get
round the prohibitions, and it ended in my disgrace. But
since I have known you, I know, I know for the first time,
that I may for the first time, without remorse or harm to
what is described as my lofty calling, let myself go like anybody
else, although Doctor Ueberbein says, and says in
Latin, that that must never be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you see what your friend said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't you yourself call him a poor wretch, who would
come to a sad end? He's a fine character; I esteem him
greatly, and owe him many hints about myself and things in
general. But I've often thought about him recently, and as
you expressed so unfavourable a verdict upon him then, I
have spent hours considering your verdict, and was forced to
own you right. For I'll tell you, Imma, how things stand
with Doctor Ueberbein. His whole life is hostile to happiness,
that's what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems to me a very proper hostility,&rdquo; said Imma
Spoelmann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proper,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but wretched, as you yourself
said, and what's more, sinful, for it is a sin against something
nobler than his severe propriety, as I now see, and it's
this sin in which he wished to educate me in his fatherly
fashion. But I've now grown out of his education, at this
point I have, I'm now independent and know better; and
though I may not have convinced Ueberbein, I'll convince
you, Imma, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Prince, I must grant you that! You have the powers
of conviction, your zeal carries one along irresistibly with
it! Nineteen days, didn't you say? I maintain that eighteen
and a half is right, but it comes to much the same thing.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_283" title="283"> </a>
In that time you have condescended to appear at Delphinenort
once&mdash;four days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw a startled look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Imma, you must have patience with me, and some
indulgence. Consider, I'm still awkward &hellip; this is strange
ground. I don't know how it was&hellip;. I believe I wanted
to let us have time. And then there came several calls upon
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you had to fire at the targets for show. I
read all about it. As usual, you had a rousing success to
show for it. You stood there in your fancy dress, and let a
whole meadowful of people love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt, Imma, I beg you, don't gallop&hellip;. One can't get
a word out&hellip;. Love, you say. But what sort of love is
it? A meadow-love, a casual, superficial love, a love at a
distance, which means nothing&mdash;a love in full dress with no
familiarity about it. No, you've absolutely no reason to be
angry because I express myself pleased with it, for I get no
good from it; only the people do, who are elevated by it, and
that's their desire. But I too have my desire, Imma, and it's
to you that I turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I help you, Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know well! It's confidence, Imma; couldn't you
have a little confidence in me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, and the scrutiny of her big eyes had
never before been so dark and piercing. But for all the
urgency of his dumb pleading, she turned away, and said
with a look which betrayed no secrets: &ldquo;No, Prince Klaus
Heinrich, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He uttered a cry of grief, and his voice shook, as he asked:
&ldquo;And why can't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replied: &ldquo;Because you prevent me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I prevent you? Please tell me, I beg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with the reserved expression still on her face, her eyes
dropped on her white reins, and rocking lightly to her horse's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_284" title="284"> </a>
walk, she replied: &ldquo;Through everything, through your conduct,
through the way and manner of your being, through
your highly distinguished personality. You know well enough
how you prevented the poor Countess from letting herself
go, and forced her to be clear-brained and reasonable, although
it is expressly on the ground of her excessive experiences
that the blessing of craziness and oddness has been
vouchsafed to her, and that I told you that I was well aware
how you had set out to sober her. Yes, I know it well, for
you prevent me too from letting myself go, you sober me too,
continually, in every way, through your words, through your
look, through your way of sitting and standing, and it is
quite impossible to have confidence in you. I've had the opportunity
of watching you in your intercourse with other
people; but whether it was Doctor Sammet in the Dorothea
Hospital or Herr Stavenüter in the &lsquo;Pheasantry&rsquo; Tea-garden,
it was always the same, and it always made me shiver. You
hold yourself erect, and ask questions, but you don't do so
out of sympathy, you don't care what the questions are about&mdash;no,
you don't care about anything, and you lay nothing
to heart. I've often seen it&mdash;you speak, you express an
opinion, but you might just as well express a quite different
one, for in reality you have no opinion and no belief, and the
only thing you care about is your princely self-possession.
You say sometimes that your calling is not an easy one, but
as you have challenged me, I'll ask you to notice that it
would be easier to you if you had an opinion and a belief,
Prince, that's my opinion and belief. How could anyone
have confidence in you! No, it's not confidence that you
inspire, but coldness and embarrassment; and if I put myself
out to get closer to you, that kind of embarrassment
and awkwardness would prevent me from doing so,&mdash;there's
my answer for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had listened to her with painful tension, had looked
more than once at her pale face while she was speaking, and
then again, like her, dropped his eyes on the reins.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_285" title="285"> </a>&ldquo;I must indeed thank you, Imma,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for
speaking so earnestly, for you know that you don't always
do so, but generally speak only derisively, and in your way
take things as little seriously as I in mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How else but derisively can I speak to you, Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes you are so hard and cruel, as for instance
towards the head sister in the Dorothea Hospital, whom you
threw into such confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm well aware that I too have my faults, and need
somebody to help me to give them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be that somebody, Imma; we'll help each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think we can help each other, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can. Didn't you speak just now quite seriously
and unsatirically? But as for me, you are not right when
you say that I care about nothing at all and lay nothing to
heart, for I care about you, Imma&mdash;about you, I have laid you
to heart; and as this matter is one of such inexpressible
seriousness to me, I cannot fail finally to win your confidence.
Were you aware of my joy when I heard you talk of putting
yourself out and coming nearer to me? Yes, put yourself
out a little, and do not let yourself ever again be confused
with that sort of awkwardness, or whatever it is, which you
are so liable to feel in my presence. Ah, I know it, I know
only too well, how much to blame I am for that! But
laugh at yourself and at me when I make you feel like
that, and attach yourself to me. Will you promise me to
put yourself out a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Imma Spoelmann promised nothing, but insisted now
on her gallop; and many a subsequent conversation remained,
like this, without result.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Klaus Heinrich had come to tea, the
Prince, Miss Spoelmann, the Countess, and Percival went into
the park. The splendid collie kept decorously at Imma's
side, and Countess Löwenjoul walked two or three yards behind
the young people; for soon after they had started she
had stopped for a second, to twine her bent and bony fingers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" title="286"> </a>
round a blossom, and she had never made good the distance
she had then lost. So Klaus Heinrich and Imma walked in
front of her, and talked. But when they had covered a certain
distance, they turned round, thus getting the Countess
two or three yards in front of them. Then Klaus Heinrich
followed up his conversational efforts, and, carefully and
without looking up, took Imma Spoelmann's small, ringless
hand from her side and clasped it in both his, the while he
imploringly asked whether she was taking pains, and had
made any progress in her confidence in him.</p>

<p>It displeased him to hear that she had been working, poring
over algebra and playing in the lofty spheres since they had
last met. He would beg her to lay her books aside now, as
they might distract her and divert her from the matter to
which all her thinking powers must now be devoted. He
talked also about himself, about that sobering effect and awkwardness
which, according to her, his existence inspired; he
tried to explain it, and in doing so to weaken it. He spoke
about the cold, stern, and barren existence which had been
his hitherto, he described to her how everybody had always
flocked to gaze at him, while it had been his lofty calling
to show himself and to be gazed at, a much more difficult
task. He did his best to make her recognize that the remedy
for that which caused him to prevent the poor Countess from
drivelling and to estrange her to his own sorrow, that this
remedy could be found in her, only in her, and was given
over absolutely into her hands.</p>

<p>She looked at him, her big eyes sparkled in dark scrutiny,
and it was clear that she, she too, was struggling. But then
she would shake her head or break off the conversation, introducing
with a pout some topic over which she made merry,
incapable of bringing herself to take the responsibility of
the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for which he begged her, that undefined and, as
matters stood, absolutely non-committal surrender.</p>

<p>She did not prevent him from coming once or twice a week;
she did not prevent him from speaking, from assailing her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" title="287"> </a>
with prayers and asseverations and from taking her hand
now and then between his own. But she was only patient,
she remained unmoved, her dread of taking the decisive step,
that aversion from leaving her cool and derisive kingdom and
confessing herself his, seemed unconquerable; and she could
not help, in her anguish and exhaustion, breaking out with
the words: &ldquo;Oh, Prince, we ought never to have met&mdash;it
would have been best if we hadn't. Then you would have
pursued your lofty calling as calmly as ever, and I should
have preserved my peace of mind, and neither would have
harassed the other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince had much difficulty in inducing her to recant,
and in extorting from her the confession that she did not
entirely regret having made his acquaintance. But all this
took time. The summer came to an end, early night-frosts
loosened the still-green leaves from the trees, Fatma's, Florian's,
and Isabeau's hoofs rustled in the red-and-gold leafage when
they went for a ride. Autumn came with its mists and sharp
smells&mdash;and nobody could have prophesied an end, or indeed
any decisive turn in the course of the strangely fluctuating
affair.</p>

<p>The credit of having placed things on the foundation of
actuality, of having given events the lead in the direction of
a happy issue, must for ever be ascribed to the distinguished
gentleman who had up till now wisely kept in the background,
but at the right moment intervened carefully but
firmly. I refer to Excellency von Knobelsdorff, Minister of
the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and the Grand Ducal Household.</p>

<p>Dr. Ueberbein had been correct in his assertion that the
President of the Council had kept himself posted in the
stages of Klaus Heinrich's love affair. What is more, well
served by intelligent and sagacious assistants, he had kept himself
well in touch with the state of public opinion, with the
rôle which Samuel Spoelmann and his daughter played in the
imaginative powers of the people, with the royal rank with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_288" title="288"> </a>
which the popular idea invested them, with the great and
superstitious tension with which the population followed the
intercourse between the Schlosses &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; and Delphinenort,
with the popularity of that intercourse: in a word, he
was well aware how the Spoelmanns, for everyone who did
not deliberately shut his eyes, were the general topic of conversation
and rumour, not only in the capital, but in the
whole country. A characteristic incident was enough to
make Herr Knobelsdorff sure of his ground.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October&mdash;the Landtag had been opened
a fortnight before, and the disputes with the Budget Commission
were in full swing&mdash;Imma Spoelmann fell ill, very
seriously ill, so it was said at first. It seemed that the imprudent
girl, for some whim or mood, while out with her
countess, had ventured on a gallop of nearly half an hour's
duration on her white Fatma in the teeth of a strong north-east
wind, and had come home with an attack of congestion
of the lungs, which threatened to end her altogether.</p>

<p>The news soon got about. People said the girl was hovering
between life and death, which, as luckily soon emerged,
was a great exaggeration. But the consternation, the general
sympathy, could not have been greater if a serious accident
had happened to a member of the House of Grimmburg, even
to the Grand Duke himself. It was the sole topic of conversation.
In the humbler parts of the city, near the Dorothea
Hospital for instance, the women stood in the evening outside
their front doors, pressed the palms of their hands against
their breasts, and coughed, as if to show each other what it
meant to be short of breath. The evening papers published
searching and expert news of the condition of Miss Spoelmann,
which passed from hand to hand, were read at family
gatherings and cafés, and were discussed in the tram-cars.
The <i>Courier's</i> reporter had been seen to drive in a cab to
Delphinenort, where, in the hall with the mosaic floor, he
had been snubbed by the Spoelmanns' butler, and had talked
English to him&mdash;though he found that no easy task.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" title="289"> </a>The press, moreover, could not escape the reproach of
having magnified the whole business, and made a quite unnecessary
fuss about it. There was absolutely no question
of any danger. Six days in bed under the care of the Spoelmanns'
private physician sufficed to relieve the congestion, and
to make Miss Spoelmann's lungs quite well again. But these
six days sufficed also to make clear the importance which the
Spoelmanns, and Miss Imma's personality in particular, had
achieved in our public opinion. Every morning found the
envoys of the newspapers, commissioners of the general
curiosity, gathered in the mosaic hall at Delphinenort to hear
the butler's curt bulletins, which they then reproduced in
their papers at the inordinate length which the public desired.</p>

<p>One read of greetings and wishes for recovery sent to
Delphinenort by various benevolent institutions which Imma
Spoelmann had visited and richly subscribed to (and the
wits remarked that the Grand Ducal Treasury might have
taken the opportunity of offering their homage in a similar
way). The public read also&mdash;and dropped the paper to exchange
a significant look&mdash;of a &ldquo;beautiful floral tribute,&rdquo;
which Prince Klaus Heinrich had sent with his card (the
truth being that the Prince, so long as Miss Spoelmann kept
to her bed, sent flowers not once, but daily, to Delphinenort,
a fact which was not mentioned by those in the know, so as
not to make too great a sensation).</p>

<p>The public read further that the popular young patient had
left her bed for the first time, and finally the news came
that she was soon to go out for the first time. But this going
out, which took place on a sunny autumn morning, eight
days after the patient had been taken ill, was calculated to
give rise to such an expression of feeling on the part of the
population as people of stern self-possession labelled immoderate.
For round the Spoelmanns' huge olive-varnished,
red-cushioned motor, which, with a pale young chauffeur of
an Anglo-Saxon type on the box, waited in front of the main
door at Delphinenort, a big crowd had gathered; and when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" title="290"> </a>
Miss Spoelmann and Countess Löwenjoul, followed by a
lackey with a rug, came out, cheers broke out, hats and
handkerchiefs were waved, until the motor had forced a way
through the crowd and had left the demonstrators behind in
a cloud of vapour. It must be confessed that these consisted
of those rather doubtful elements who usually collect on
such occasions: half-grown youths, a few women with market-baskets,
one or two schoolboys, gapers, loafers, and out-of-works
of various descriptions.</p>

<p>But what is the public and what should its composition be
to make it an average public? One further assertion must
not be passed over entirely in silence which was later disseminated
by the cynics. It was to the effect that among the
crowd round the motor there was an agent in Herr von
Knobelsdorff's pay, a member of the secret police, who had
started the cheers and vigorously kept them going. We can
leave that in doubt, and not grudge the belittlers of important
events their satisfaction.</p>

<p>At least, in the case of this particular crowd, it only
amounts to saying that the agent's task was the mechanical release
of feelings which must have been there and must have
been vivid. At any rate this scene, which of course was described
at length in the daily press, did not fail to impress
everybody, and persons with any acumen for the connexion
of things felt no doubt that a further piece of news, which
busied men's minds a few days later, stood in hidden relation
to all these phenomena and symptoms.</p>

<p>The news ran that his Royal Highness Prince Klaus Heinrich
had received his Excellency the Minister of State von
Knobelsdorff in audience at the Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; and had
been closeted with him from three o'clock in the afternoon till
seven o'clock in the evening. A whole four hours! What
had they discussed? Surely not the next Court Ball? As a
matter of fact, the Court Ball had been one among several
topics of conversation.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff had preferred his request for a confidential
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" title="291"> </a>
talk with the Prince in connexion with the Court
Hunt, which had taken place on October 10th in the woods to
the west near Schloss &ldquo;Jägerpreis,&rdquo; and in which Klaus Heinrich
and his red-haired cousins, dressed in green uniforms,
soft felt hats, and top-boots, and hung with field-glasses, hangers,
hunting-knives, bandoliers, and pistol cases, had taken
part. Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf had been consulted,
and three o'clock on October 12th decided on. Klaus Heinrich
himself had offered to visit the old gentleman at his official
residence, but Herr von Knobelsdorff had preferred coming
to the &ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo; He came punctually, and was received
with all the affection and warmth which Klaus Heinrich
thought that propriety demanded in the case of the aged
counsellor of his father and his brother. The sober little
room, in which stood the three fine mahogany Empire arm-chairs,
with the blue lyre-embroidery on the yellow ground,
was the scene of the interview.</p>

<p>Though close on seventy, Excellency von Knobelsdorff was
vigorous both in body and mind. His frock-coat showed not
one senile wrinkle, but was tightly and well filled with the
compact and comfortable form of a man of happy disposition.
His well-preserved hair was pure white, like his short moustache,
and parted smoothly in the middle; his chin had a sympathetic
pit in it, which might pass for a dimple. The fan-shaped
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes played as livelily as
ever&mdash;indeed, they had gained with the years some little
branches and additional lines, so that the whole complication
of ever-shifting wrinkles imparted to his blue eyes an expression
of humorous subtlety.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was attached to Herr von Knobelsdorff,
though no closer relations had been established between them.
The Minister of State had actually superintended and organized
the Prince's life. He had begun by fixing on Dröge to
be his first tutor; had then called the &ldquo;Pheasantry&rdquo; into life
for him; had sent him later to the University with Dr. Ueberbein;
had also arranged his military service for show, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" title="292"> </a>
had put Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; at his disposal to live in. But
all this he had done at second-hand, and had rarely interviewed
him in person. Indeed, when Herr von Knobelsdorff
had met Klaus Heinrich during those years of education, he
had inquired most respectfully as to the Prince's resolves
and plans for the future, as if he were in complete ignorance
of them; and perhaps it was just this fiction, which was
firmly bolstered up on both sides, which had kept their intercourse
throughout within the bounds of formality.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff began the conversation in an easy
though respectful tone, while Klaus Heinrich tried to discover
the objects of his visit. The former then chatted about
the hunt of the day before yesterday, made some pleasant
reference to the amount of ground they had covered, and then
mentioned casually his admirable colleague at the Treasury,
Dr. Krippenreuther, who had also taken part in the hunt,
and whose invalid appearance he regretted. Herr Krippenreuther
had really not hit a thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, worry makes the hand unsteady,&rdquo; remarked Herr von
Knobelsdorff, and so gave the Prince the cue for a direct
reference to this worry. He spoke about the &ldquo;by no means
trifling&rdquo; shortage in the estimates, about the Minister's discussions
with the Budget Commission, the new property-tax,
the rate of 13½ per cent., and the bitter opposition of the
urban deputies, of the antediluvian meat tax, and the Civil
Service's cries of hunger; and Klaus Heinrich, who had been
surprised at first by so many dry facts, listened to him intently
and nodded his head repeatedly.</p>

<p>The two men, the old and young, sat side by side on a
slender, hardish sofa with yellow upholstery and wreath-like
brass mountings, which stood behind the round table opposite
the narrow glass door. The latter opened on to the terrace,
and through it one could see the half-bare park and the duck
pond floating in the autumn mist. The low, white, smooth
stove, in which a fire was crackling, diffused a gentle warmth
through the severely and scantily furnished room. Klaus
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" title="293"> </a>
Heinrich, though not quite able to follow the political proceedings,
yet proud and happy at being so seriously talked
to by the experienced dignitary, felt his mood growing more
and more grateful and confidential. Herr von Knobelsdorff
spoke pleasantly about the most unpleasant subjects. His
voice was comforting, his remarks ably strung together and
insinuating&mdash;and suddenly Klaus Heinrich became aware that
he had dropped the subject of the State finances, and had
passed on from Doctor Krippenreuther's worries to his, Klaus
Heinrich's, own condition. Was Herr von Knobelsdorff
mistaken? His eyes were beginning occasionally to play
him tricks. But he wished he could think that his Royal
Highness looked a little better, fresher, brighter&mdash;a look of
tiredness, of worry, was unmistakable&hellip;. Herr von Knobelsdorff
feared to seem importunate; but he must hope that
these symptoms did not arise from any malady, bodily or
mental?</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich looked out at the mist. His look was still
sealed: but though he sat on the hard sofa in his usual stiff,
upright attitude, his feet crossed, his right hand over his
left, and the upper part of his body turned towards Herr
von Knobelsdorff, yet inwardly his stiffness relaxed at this
juncture, and, worn out as he was by his strangely ineffectual
struggle, it did not want much more to make his eyes fill
with tears. He was so lonely, so destitute of counsellors.
Dr. Ueberbein had recently kept far away from the &ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo;
&hellip; Klaus Heinrich merely said: &ldquo;Ah, Excellency,
that would take us too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Herr von Knobelsdorff answered: &ldquo;Too far? No,
your Royal Highness need not be afraid of being too prolix.
I confess that my knowledge of your Royal Highness's experiences
is greater than I allowed to appear just now. Your
Royal Highness can scarcely have anything new to tell me,
apart from those refinements and details which rumour can
never collect. But if it might comfort your Royal Highness
to open his heart to an old servant, who carried you in his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" title="294"> </a>
arms &hellip; perhaps I might not be quite incapable of standing
by your Royal Highness in word and deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then it happened that something gave way in Klaus
Heinrich's bosom, and poured out in a stream of confession:
he told Herr von Knobelsdorff the whole story. He told it
as one tells when the heart is full and everything comes
tumbling out all at once through the lips; according to no
plan, no chronological order, and with undue emphasis on
unessentials, but with a burst of passion, and with that concreteness
which is the product of passionate observation. He
began in the middle, jumped unexpectedly to the beginning,
hurried on to the conclusion (which did not exist), tumbled
over himself, and more than once hesitated and stuck fast.</p>

<p>But Herr von Knobelsdorff's fore-knowledge made the review
easier for him, enabled him by slipping in suggestive
questions to float the ship again. And at last the picture
of Klaus Heinrich's experiences with all their characters and
leading actors, with the figures of Samuel Spoelmann, of the
crazy Countess Löwenjoul, even of the collie, Percival, and
especially that of Imma Spoelmann, with all its contrariness,
lay there complete and full, ready to be discussed. The piece
of oil-silk was referred to in full detail, for Herr von Knobelsdorff
seemed to attach importance to it. Nothing was omitted,
from the impressive incident at the changing of the guard to
the last intimate and distressing struggles on horseback and
on foot.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was much wrought up when he finished,
and his steel-blue eyes in the national cheek-bones were full
of tears. He had left the sofa, thereby forcing Herr von
Knobelsdorff also to get up, and wished on account of the
heat to open the glass door into the little veranda, but Herr
von Knobelsdorff stopped this by calling attention to the risk
of a chill. He begged the Prince humbly to sit down again,
as his Royal Highness could not conceal from himself the
need for a calm discussion of the state of affairs. And both
sat down again on the thinly cushioned sofa.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_295" title="295"> </a>Herr von Knobelsdorff meditated awhile, and his face was
as serious as it ever could be with his dimpled chin and the
play of his eye-wrinkles. Then, breaking silence, he thanked
the Prince with emotion for the great honour he had shown
him by confiding in him. And in direct connexion with this
Herr von Knobelsdorff, emphasizing each word, announced
that whatever attitude the Prince had expected him, Herr von
Knobelsdorff, to assume at this juncture, he, Herr von Knobelsdorff,
was certainly not the man to oppose the wishes and
hopes of the Prince, but much rather to show his Royal
Highness the way to the longed-for goal to the best of his
power.</p>

<p>Long silence ensued. Klaus Heinrich looked rapturously
at Herr von Knobelsdorff's eyes with the fan-like wrinkles.
Had he these wishes and hopes? Was there a goal? He
was not sure of his ears. He said: &ldquo;Your Excellency is
kind enough&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Herr von Knobelsdorff added to his declaration a
condition, and said: Frankly, on one condition only did he,
as first official of the State, dare to exercise his modest influence
on behalf of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On condition that your Royal Highness does not take
account only of your own happiness in a selfish and frivolous
way, but, as your lofty calling demands, regards your personal
destiny from the point of view of the Mass, the Whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich was silent, and his eyes were heavy in
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your Royal Highness,&rdquo; continued Herr von
Knobelsdorff after a pause, &ldquo;will allow me to leave this delicate
and yet quite unavoidable topic for a while, and to turn
to more general matters! This is the hour of confidence
and mutual understanding &hellip; I respectfully beg to be allowed
to take advantage of it. Your Royal Highness is
through your exalted position cut off from rude actuality,
severed from it by delicate precautions. I shall not forget
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" title="296"> </a>
that this actuality is not&mdash;or only at second-hand&mdash;a matter
for your Royal Highness. And yet the moment seems to me
to have come for bringing at least a certain portion of this
rude world to the immediate notice of your Royal Highness,
entirely for your own sake. I plead beforehand for forgiveness,
if I chance to stir up your Royal Highness's emotions too
harshly by what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please speak on, Excellency,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich hastily.
Involuntarily he sat upright, just as one sits up straight in
a dentist's chair and collects one's natural powers to withstand
an attack of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must ask for your undivided attention,&rdquo; said Herr von
Knobelsdorff almost sternly. And then, as a corollary to the
discussions with the Budget Commission, followed the statement,
the clear, exhaustive, unembroidered lesson, well primed
with figures and explanations of the fundamental facts and
technical expressions, which showed the economical position
of the country, the State, and brought our whole miserable
plight with relentless clearness before the Prince's eyes.</p>

<p>Naturally these things were not entirely new and strange to
him. Indeed, ever since he had assumed his representative
rôle, they had served as a motive and subject for those formal
questions which he used to address to burgomasters, agriculturists,
and high officials, and to which he received answers
which were merely answers and nothing more, and which were
often accompanied by the smile which he had known all his
life and which reminded him that he was born to be king.
But all this had not yet forced itself upon him in its naked
actuality, nor made serious claims on his thinking powers.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff was by no means satisfied to get a
few of Klaus Heinrich's usual encouraging words; he pressed
the matter home, he cross-examined the young man, made
him repeat whole sentences; he kept him relentlessly to the
point, and reminded the Prince of a dry and skinny index-finger
which stopped at each separate place and would not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" title="297"> </a>
go on until convinced that the pupil really understood the
lesson.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff began at the rudiments, and talked
about the country and its lack of development from a commercial
and industrial point of view: he talked about the
people, Klaus Heinrich's people, that shrewd and honest,
sound and reliable stock. He spoke about the deficiency in
the State reserves, the poor dividends paid by the railways,
the insufficient coal supply. He touched on the administration
of the forests, game preserves and stock-raising; he
talked about the woods, the excessive felling, the immoderate
stripping of litter, the crippling of the industry, the falling
revenues from the forests. Then he went more closely into
our stock of gold, discussed the natural inability of the people
to pay heavy taxes, described the reckless finance of earlier
periods. Thereupon he added up the figures of the State debt,
which Herr von Knobelsdorff forced the Prince to repeat
several times. They reached six hundred millions.</p>

<p>The lesson extended further to the debentures, conditions
for interest and repayment. It came back to Doctor Krippenreuther's
present anxiety, and described the seriousness of
the situation. Suddenly pulling the &ldquo;Annual of the Statistical
Bureau&rdquo; out of his pocket, Herr von Knobelsdorff instructed
his pupil in the harvest returns for the previous
years, summed up the untoward events which had caused
their decline, pointed to the deficiencies in the taxes, the figures
of which he had brought with him, and referred to the underfed
adults and children whom one might see throughout the
country-side. Then he turned to the general condition of the
gold market, discoursed on the rise in the value of gold and
the general economic unsoundness. Klaus Heinrich learned
also about the lowness of the Exchange, the restlessness of
the creditors, the leakage of gold, and the bank smashes; he
saw our credit shaken, our paper valueless, and grasped to
the full that the raising of a new loan was almost impossible.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_298" title="298"> </a>The night was closing in, it was long past five, when Herr
von Knobelsdorff ended his statement of the national economics.
At this time Klaus Heinrich usually had his tea,
but this time he only gave a passing thought to it, and nobody
outside dared to disturb a conversation whose importance was
shown by its duration. Klaus Heinrich listened and listened.
He scarcely realized how much affected he was. But how
could the other bring himself to say all that to him? He
had not called him &ldquo;Royal Highness&rdquo; one single time during
the interview, he had to some extent forced him, and grossly
ignored the fact that he was &ldquo;born to be king.&rdquo; And yet it
was good and stimulating to hear all that and to have to bury
oneself in it for reality's sake. He forgot to have the lights
brought, his attention was so much occupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was these circumstances,&rdquo; concluded Herr von Knobelsdorff,
&ldquo;which I had in mind when I begged your Royal Highness
to regard your personal wishes and plans continually in
the light of the general good. I have no doubt that your
Royal Highness will profit by this talk and by the facts I
have been bold enough to put before you. And in this connexion
I beg your Royal Highness to allow me to revert to
your more personal case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff waited till Klaus Heinrich had made
a sign of consent with his hand, and then went on: &ldquo;If this
affair is to have any future, it is desirable that it should now
advance a step in its development. It is stagnating, it remains
as formless and prospectless as the mist outside. That's
intolerable. We must give it form, must thicken it out,
must mark its outlines more clearly before the eyes of the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so! quite so! Give it form &hellip; thicken it out&hellip;.
That's it. That's absolutely necessary,&rdquo; agreed Klaus
Heinrich, so much excited that he left the sofa and began to
walk up and down the room. &ldquo;But how? For heaven's sake,
Excellency, tell me how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next external step,&rdquo; said Herr von Knobelsdorff, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_299" title="299"> </a>
remained sitting&mdash;so unusual was the occasion&mdash;&ldquo;must be
this, that the Spoelmanns be seen at Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich stopped still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never, if I know Mr. Spoelmann, will he
let himself be persuaded to go to Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; answered Herr von Knobelsdorff, &ldquo;doesn't prevent
his daughter from doing us this pleasure. The Court Ball's
not so very far off; it rests with you, Royal Highness, to
induce Miss Spoelmann to take part in it. Her companion
is a countess &hellip; a peculiar one, perhaps, but a countess,
and that helps things. When I assure your Royal Highness
that the Court will not fail to make things easy, I am speaking
with the approbation of the Chief Master of the Ceremonies,
Herr von Bühl zu Bühl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation now turned for three-quarters of an hour
on questions of precedence, and the ceremonial conditions
under which the presentation must be carried out. The distribution
of cards was always left to Princess Catherine's
Mistress of the Robes, a widowed Countess Trümmerhauff,
who led the ladies' world at the festivities in the Old Castle.</p>

<p>But as to the act of presentation itself, Herr von Knobelsdorff
had managed to secure some concessions of a deliberate,
in fact definite character. There was no American Consul
in the place&mdash;no reason on that account, explained Herr von
Knobelsdorff, for letting the ladies be presented by any casual
chamberlain; no, the Master of the Ceremonies himself requested
the honour of presenting them to the Grand Duke.
When? At what point of the prescribed procession? Why,
undoubtedly, unusual circumstances demand exceptions. In
the first place, then, in front of all the débutantes of the
various ranks&mdash;Klaus Heinrich might assure Miss Spoelmann
that this would be arranged. It would give rise to
talk and sensation at Court and in the city. But never mind,
so much the better. Sensation was by no means undesirable,
sensation was useful, even necessary&hellip;.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff went. It had become so dark when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_300" title="300"> </a>
he took his leave that the Prince and he could scarcely see
each other. Klaus Heinrich, who now first became aware of
it, excused himself in some confusion, but Herr von Knobelsdorff
declared it to be a matter of no importance in what
sort of light a conversation like that was carried on. He took
the hand which Klaus Heinrich offered him, and grasped it
in both his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said warmly, and these were his last words before
he went, &ldquo;never was the happiness of a prince more inseparable
from that of his people. No, whatever your Royal
Highness ponders and does, you will bear in mind that the
happiness of your Royal Highness by the disposition of
destiny has become a condition of the public weal, but that
your Royal Highness on your side must recognize in the weal
of your country the indispensable condition and justification
of your own happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much moved, and not yet in a condition to arrange the
thoughts which poured in on him in thousands, Klaus Heinrich
remained behind in his homely Empire room.</p>

<p>He passed a restless night and went next morning, despite
misty and damp weather, for a long and lonely ride. Herr
von Knobelsdorff had talked clearly and voluminously, had
given and accepted facts; but, for the fusion, modelling, and
working up of these multifarious raw products he had given
only curt, aphoristic instructions, and Klaus Heinrich found
himself doomed to some heavy thinking while he lay awake at
night, and later when he went for a ride on Florian.</p>

<p>When he got back to the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; he did a remarkable
thing. He wrote with a pencil on a piece of paper an order,
a certain commission, and sent Neumann, the valet, with it
to the Academy Bookshop in the University Strasse: Neumann
came back with a package of books, which Klaus
Heinrich had set out in his room, and which he began at
once to read.</p>

<p>They were works of a sober and school-bookish appearance,
with glazed paper backs, ugly leather sides, and coarse paper,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_301" title="301"> </a>
and the contents were divided up minutely into sections,
main divisions, sub-divisions, and paragraphs. Their titles
were not stimulating. They were manuals and hand-hooks
of economy, abstracts and outlines of State finance, systematic
treatises on political economy. The Prince shut himself up
in his study with these books, and gave instructions that he
wished on no account to be disturbed.</p>

<p>The autumn was damp, and Klaus Heinrich felt little
tempted to leave the &ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo; On Saturday he drove
to the Old Schloss to give free audiences: otherwise his time
was his own all this week, and he knew how to make use of
it. Wrapped in his dressing-gown, he sat in the warmth of
the low stove at his small, old-fashioned, little-used desk,
and pored over his books on finance, with his temples resting
in his hands. He read about the State expenditure and what
it always consisted of, about the receipts and whence they
flowed in when things were going well; he ploughed through
the whole subject of taxation in all its branches; he buried
himself in the doctrine of the budget, of the balance, of the
surplus, and particularly of the deficit; he lingered longest
over, and went deepest into, the public debt and its varieties,
into loans, and relation between interest and capital and
liquidation, and from time to time he raised his head from
the book and dreamed with a smile about what he had read,
as if it had been the gayest poetry.</p>

<p>For the rest, he found that it was not hard to grasp it all,
when one set one's mind to it. No, this really serious actuality,
in which he now played a part, this simple and rude
texture of interests, this system of down-right logical needs
and necessities, which countless young men of ordinary birth
had to stuff into their heads, to be able to pass examinations
in it, it was by no means so difficult to get hold of as he in
his Highness had thought. The rôle of representation, in his
opinion, was harder. And much, much more ticklish and
difficult were his gentle struggles with Imma Spoelmann on
horseback and on foot. His studies made him warm and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_302" title="302"> </a>
happy, he felt that his zeal was making his cheeks hot, like
those of his brother-in-law zu Ried-Hohenried over his peat.</p>

<p>After thus giving the facts which he had learnt from Herr
von Knobelsdorff a general academic basis, and also accomplishing
a feat of hard thinking in bringing together inward
connexions and weighing possibilities, he again presented
himself at Delphinenort at tea-time. The lights in the candelabra
with the lions' feet and the big crystal lustres were
burning in the garden room. The ladies were alone.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich first asked after Mr. Spoelmann's health
and Imma's indisposition. He upbraided her freely for her
strange impetuosity, to which she answered with a pout that
as far as she knew she was her own mistress, and could do as
she liked with her health. The conversation then turned to
the autumn, to the damp weather which forbade rides, to the
advanced time of year, and the proximity of winter, and
Klaus Heinrich suddenly mentioned the Court Ball in connexion
with which it occurred to him to ask whether the ladies&mdash;if
unfortunately Mr. Spoelmann were prevented by the
state of his health&mdash;would not care to take part in one this
time. But when Imma answered, &ldquo;No, really, she had no
wish to be rude, but she had absolutely not the faintest desire
to go to a Court Ball,&rdquo; he did not press the point, but postponed
the question for the time.</p>

<p>What had he done these last few days?&mdash;Oh, he'd been
very busy, he might say that he'd been chock-a-block with
work.&mdash;Work? Doubtless he meant the Court Hunt at
&ldquo;Jägerpreis.&rdquo;&mdash;The Court Hunt? No. He had gone in for
real study which he had by no means got to the bottom of
yet; on the contrary he was sticking deep in the literature on
the subject&hellip;. And Klaus Heinrich began to talk about
his ugly books, his peeps into financial science, and he spoke
with such pleasure and respect of this discipline that Imma
Spoelmann looked at him with her big eyes. But when&mdash;almost
timidly&mdash;she questioned him as to the motive and impulse
for this activity, he answered that it was living, only
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_303" title="303"> </a>
too burning, questions of the day which had brought him to
it: circumstances and conditions which were certainly not
well suited for a cheerful talk at tea. This remark obviously
offended Imma Spoelmann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what observations,&rdquo; she asked sharply, wagging her
head from side to side, &ldquo;did he base his conviction that she
was approachable only or preferably by way of cheerful
conversation?&rdquo; And she commanded him rather than asked
him to be kind enough to explain about the burning questions
of the day.</p>

<p>Then Klaus Heinrich explained what he had learnt from
Herr von Knobelsdorff, and talked about the land and its
state. He was well posted on every point at which the skinny
index-finger had paused: he talked about the natural and the
indebted, the general and the particular, the inherited and
the intensifying misfortunes; he emphasized particularly the
figures of the State debt, and the burden they laid on our
national economy&mdash;they were six hundred millions&mdash;and he
did not forget to mention the underfed peasants in the
country-side.</p>

<p>He did not speak connectedly; Imma Spoelmann interrupted
him with questions and helped him on with questions.
She listened carefully, and asked for explanations of what
she did not at once understand. Dressed in her loose-sleeved,
red-silk dress with the broad embroidery on the yoke, an
old-Spanish chain round her child-like neck, she sat leaning
on one elbow over the table, her chin buried in her ringless
hand, and listened with her whole soul, while her big, dark
eyes scrutinized the Prince's face.</p>

<p>But while he spoke, in answer to Imma's verbal and ocular
questions, worked at his subject, grew excited and entirely
absorbed in it, Countess Löwenjoul no longer felt herself restricted
to sober clarity by his presence, but let herself go
and indulged in the luxury of drivelling. All the misery,
she explained with dignified gestures, even the bad harvest,
the burden of debt and the rise in the price of gold, were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_304" title="304"> </a>
due to the shameless women who swarmed everywhere, and
unfortunately had discovered the way through the floor, as last
night the wife of a sergeant from the Grenadiers' Barracks
had scratched her breasts and pommelled her in a horrible
way. Then she alluded to her Schlosses in Burgundy,
through the roofs of which the rain came, and went so far
as to relate that she had gone as lieutenant in an expedition
against the Turks, on which she had been the only one who
&ldquo;had not lost her head.&rdquo; Imma Spoelmann and Klaus Heinrich
threw her a kind word now and then, readily promised
to call her Frau Meier in future, and for the rest took no
notice of her.</p>

<p>The cheeks of both were burning when Klaus Heinrich had
said all he knew&mdash;even on Miss Spoelmann's usually pearl-white
cheeks there was a shade of red to be seen. They then
stopped, the Countess too kept quiet, with her little head inclined
on her shoulder, and staring into vacancy. Klaus
Heinrich played on the white and sharply folded table-cloth
with the stem of an orchid, which had stood in a glass by
his plate; but as soon as he raised his head he met Imma
Spoelmann's large, flaming eyes, which spoke a message of
secret entreaty across the table, a darkly eloquent language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been nice to-day,&rdquo; she said in her broken voice,
when she said good-bye this time, and he felt her small, soft
hands clasp his with a firm squeeze. &ldquo;Next time your Highness
honours our unworthy house, do bring me one or two
of those excellent books you have bought.&rdquo; She could not
entirely resist mocking him, but she asked him for his finance
books, and he brought them to her.</p>

<p>He brought her two of them, which he considered the most
informative and comprehensive; he brought them some days
later in his carriage through the damp Town Garden, and she
thanked him for doing so. As soon as tea was over, they
retired to a corner of the room, and there, while the Countess
absently continued sitting at the tea-table, they began their
common studies in throne-like chairs at a gilt table, bending
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_305" title="305"> </a>
over the first page of a manual called &ldquo;The Science of Finance.&rdquo;
They even read the headings to the sections, each
reading a sentence softly in turn; for Imma Spoelmann insisted
on going methodically to work and beginning at the
beginning.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich, well prepared as he was, acted as guide
through the paragraphs, and nobody could have followed
more smartly or clear-headedly than Imma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's quite easy!&rdquo; she said and looked up with a laugh.
&ldquo;I'm surprised that it is at bottom so simple. Algebra is
much harder, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as they went so deeply into things, they did not get
far in one afternoon, so made a mark in the book at which
to start next time.</p>

<p>And so they went on, and the Prince's visits to Delphinenort
were devoted to dull realities. Whenever Mr. Spoelmann
did not come to tea, or, with Dr. Watercloose, left them, after
eating his rusk, Imma and Klaus Heinrich sat down at the
gilt table with their books, and plunged heads together into
the Science of Economics. But as they progressed, they compared
what they learned with the reality, applied what they
read to the circumstances of the country, as Klaus Heinrich
conceived them to be, and made their studies profitable,
though it happened not seldom that their investigations were
interrupted by considerations of a personal kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems, then,&rdquo; said Imma, &ldquo;that the issue may be effected
either directly or indirectly&mdash;yes, that's obvious.
Either the State turns directly to the capitalists and opens
a subscription list &hellip; Your hand is twice as broad as
mine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;look, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they looked laughingly at their hands, his right and
her left, as they lay next each other on the gilt table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; went on Imma, &ldquo;the loan is procured by negotiation,
and it is some big bank, or group of banks, to which the
State&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Wait, Imma, and answer me one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_306" title="306"> </a>
question. Aren't you missing the main point? Are you
making progress? What about the disenchantment and embarrassment,
dear little Imma? Have you now just one
spark of confidence in me?&rdquo; His lips asked the question
close to her hair, from which a delicate fragrance arose, and
she held her dark head still and bent over the book, though
she did not answer his question frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But must it be a bank or group of banks?&rdquo; she pondered.
&ldquo;There's nothing about it there; I can't think it would be
necessary in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke gravely and deliberately on these occasions, for
she too for her part had to grapple with the mental exercises
which Klaus Heinrich had successfully managed after the
conversation with Herr von Knobelsdorff. And when some
weeks later he repeated his question, whether she would not
like to go to the Court Ball, and told her of the ceremonial
conditions which had been sanctioned for this occasion, behold,
she replied that she would like to, and would go next
day with Countess Löwenjoul and leave cards on the widowed
Countess Trümmerhauff.</p>

<p>This year the Court Ball took place earlier than usual;
at the end of November&mdash;an arrangement which was said to
be due to the wishes of the Grand Ducal Party. Herr von
Bühl zu Bühl bitterly bewailed this precipitation, which
obliged him and his subordinates to cancel the arrangements
for the most important Court function, especially the improvements
which the Gala Rooms in the Old Schloss so much
needed. But the wish of the particular member of the Grand
Ducal family had had the support of Herr von Knobelsdorff,
and the Court Marshal had to give way. But it happened
thus that people's minds scarcely had time to prepare themselves
sufficiently for what really was the event of the evening,
in comparison with which the unusual date seemed as nothing.
Indeed, when the <i>Courier</i> published in leaded type the news
of the leaving of cards and the invitation&mdash;not without expressing
in rather smaller type and in glowing words its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_307" title="307"> </a>
satisfaction thereat, and welcoming Spoelmann's daughter to
the Court&mdash;the important evening was already close at hand,
and before tongues could get fairly wagging the whole thing
was a completed reality.</p>

<p>Never had more envy attached to the five hundred favoured
ones whose names stood on the Court Ball list, never had the
bourgeois more eagerly devoured the account in the <i>Courier</i>&mdash;those
dazzling columns which were written every year by a
nobleman who had degenerated through drink, and which were
such glorious reading that one felt they gave one a peep into
Fairyland, while as a matter of fact the ball in the Old Schloss
went off quite modestly and soberly. But the report only extended
to the supper, including the French menu, and everything
that came later, especially all the delicate significance
of the great occasion, were necessarily left to be reported by
word of mouth.</p>

<p>The ladies, in a huge olive-coloured motor, had pulled up in
front of the Albrechtstor at the Old Schloss fairly punctually,
though not so punctually that Herr von Bühl zu Bühl had not
had time to get anxious. From a quarter-past seven onwards
he had waited in full uniform, covered with orders down to
his waist, with a bright brown toupée and his gold pince-nez
on his nose, in the middle of the armour-hung Knights' Hall
where the Grand Ducal family and the chief officials were collected;
standing now on one foot, then on the other, and every
now and then dispatching a footman to the ballroom to find
out whether Miss Spoelmann had not yet come. He thought
of all sorts of unheard-of possibilities. If this Queen of
Sheba came too late&mdash;and what might one not expect of a girl
who had walked right through the guard?&mdash;the entry of the
Grand Ducal cortège would have to be delayed, and the Court
would have to wait for her, for she simply must be introduced
first, and it was out of the question that she should enter the
ballroom after the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>But thank heaven! a bare minute before half-past seven she
arrived with her Countess; and it made a great sensation when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_308" title="308"> </a>
the Chamberlains who received them arranged them next the
diplomats, and so in front of the nobility, the Court ladies,
the Ministers, the Generals, the Presidents of Chambers, and
all the Court world. Aide-de-camp von Platow had fetched
the Grand Duke from his rooms. Albrecht, in hussar uniform,
had greeted the members of his House with down-cast
eyes in the Knights' Hall, had offered his arm to Aunt Catherine,
and then, after Herr von Bühl had tapped three times
with his staff on the parquet in the open doors, the procession
of the Court into the ballroom had begun.</p>

<p>Eye-witnesses asserted later that the general inattention had
verged on the scandalous during the perambulation of the
Grand Duke. As Albrecht reached successive spots with his
dignified aunt, a hasty bowing and billowing without the fitting
composure ensued, but otherwise all faces were turned to
one point only in the ball, all eyes directed with burning
curiosity on this point alone&hellip;. She who stood yonder had
had enemies in the hall, at least among the women, the female
Trümmerhauffs, Prenzlaus, Wehrzahns, and Platows, who
were plying their fans here, and sharp and cold female glances
had scrutinized her. But whether her position was now too
well established for criticism to venture to assail her, or her
personality itself had conquered the secret opposition&mdash;all had
declared with one voice that Imma Spoelmann was as fine as
the daughter of the King of the Mountains.</p>

<p>The whole town, the clerk in the Government office, the
messenger at the street corner, knew her toilette by heart next
morning. It had been a gown of pale-green crêpe de chine,
with silver embroidery and priceless old silver lace on the
bodice. A tiara of diamonds had glittered in her dark hair,
which showed a tendency to fall in smooth wisps across her
forehead, and a long hanging chain of the same stones was
wound two or three times round her brown throat. Small and
child-like, yet strangely earnest and sensible-looking, with her
pale face and big, strangely speaking eyes, she had stood in
her place of honour by the side of Countess Löwenjoul, who
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_309" title="309"> </a>
had been dressed in brown as usual, though this time in satin.
When the cortège reached her, she had, with a kind of coy
pertness, made a suggestion of a curtsey, without completing
it; but when Prince Klaus Heinrich, with the yellow ribbon
and the flat chain of the Family Order &ldquo;For Constancy&rdquo; over
his tunic, the silver star of the Grimmburg Griffin on his chest,
and his anæmic cousin on his arm whose conversation was
limited to &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; passed by her directly after the Grand Duke,
she had smiled with closed lips and nodded to him like a
comrade&mdash;which sent something like a quiver through the
company.</p>

<p>Then, after the diplomats had been received by the Grand
Ducal party, the presentations had begun&mdash;begun with Imma
Spoelmann, although there had been two Countess Hundskeels
and one Baroness von Schulenburg-Tressen among the débutantes.
With an ingratiating smile, which showed his false
teeth, Herr von Bühl had presented Spoelmann's daughter to
his master. And Albrecht, sucking his lower lip against his
upper, had looked down on her coy semi-curtsey, from which
she had raised herself to scrutinize with her speaking eyes the
suffering Hussar Colonel in his silent pride. The Grand Duke
had addressed several questions to her, an exception to an
otherwise strict rule; he had asked her how her father was,
what effect the Ditlinde Spa had, and how she liked on the
whole being with us&mdash;questions which she had answered in her
broken voice with a pout and a wag of her dark head. Then,
after a pause, a pause perhaps of internal struggle, Albrecht
had expressed his pleasure at seeing her at Court; whereupon
Countess Löwenjoul had executed her curtsey, with an evasive
glance from her eyes.</p>

<p>This scene, Imma Spoelmann in the presence of Albrecht,
long remained the favourite topic of conversation, and although
it had passed, as it was bound to pass, without anything
unusual happening, yet its charm and importance must
not be overlooked. It was not indeed the climax of the evening.
That, in the eyes of many, was the Quadrille d'honneur;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_310" title="310"> </a>
in the eyes of others, the supper,&mdash;in reality, however, it was
a secret duologue between the two chief actors in the piece, a
short, unnoticed exchange of words, whose contents and actual
result the public could only guess&mdash;the settlement of certain
tender struggles on horseback and on foot.</p>

<p>As to the Quadrille d'honneur, there were people who declared
next day that Miss Spoelmann had danced in it, with
Prince Klaus Heinrich as her partner. Only the first part of
this story was correct. Miss Spoelmann had taken part in the
solemn dance, but as the British Consul's partner and Prince
Klaus Heinrich's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>. This was fairly strong, but what
was still stronger was that the majority of the guests did not
consider it an unheard-of thing, but on the contrary almost a
matter of course.</p>

<p>Yes, Imma Spoelmann's position was established; the popular
conception of her personality&mdash;as the public learned next
day&mdash;had prevailed in the Court ballroom, and, what is more,
Herr von Knobelsdorff had taken care that this conception
should be expressed with all the publicity he thought desirable.
Not with distinctive or aggressive respect; no, Imma Spoelmann
had been treated ceremoniously, and at the same time
with systematic, intentional emphasis. The two Masters of
the Ceremonies on duty&mdash;Chamberlains in rank&mdash;had introduced
selected dancers to her; and when she had left her place,
close by the low red platform where the Grand Ducal family
sat on damask chairs, to dance with her partners, they had
busied themselves, just as when the princesses danced, in clearing
her a space under the chandelier in the middle and protecting
her from collisions&mdash;an easy task in any case, for a protective
circle of curiosity had formed round her when she
danced.</p>

<p>It was reported that when Prince Klaus Heinrich asked
Miss Spoelmann for the first time, a deep drawing of breath,
a formal &ldquo;Sh&rdquo; of excitement had been heard in the ballroom,
and the Masters of the Ceremonies had found it difficult to
keep the ball going and to prevent the whole company standing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_311" title="311"> </a>
round the dancers in gaping curiosity. The women
especially had watched the pair with an excited delight, which,
had Miss Spoelmann's position been only a little weaker,
would undoubtedly have taken on the form of rage and malice.
But the pressure and influence of public feeling, that powerful
inspiration from below, had worked too powerfully on
every one of the five hundred guests for them to be able
to regard this spectacle through any eyes other than those of
the people. It did not seem to have occurred to the Prince
to impose any restraint upon himself. His name&mdash;shortened
to &ldquo;K.&nbsp;H.&rdquo;&mdash;appeared twice on Miss Spoelmann's programme,
and besides he had sat out several other dances with her. They
had danced yonder. Her brown arm had rested on the yellow-silk
ribbon that crossed his shoulder, and his right arm had
encircled her light and child-like figure, while, as usual when
he danced, he had placed the left on his hip and guided his
partner with one hand only. With one hand!&hellip;</p>

<p>When supper-time came, a further article in the ceremonial
conditions which Herr von Knobelsdorff had contrived for
Imma Spoelmann's visit to Court came into staggering force.
It was the article which dealt with the order of seating at
the table. For while the majority of the guests supped at
long tables in the picture gallery and in the Hall of the
Twelve Months, supper was laid in the Silver Hall for the
Grand Ducal family, diplomats, and leading Court officials.
In solemn procession, as when they entered the ballroom,
Albrecht and his party entered the supper-room punctually
at eleven o'clock. And Imma Spoelmann passed by the
lackeys, who kept the doors and repelled the uninvited, on
the arm of the British Consul, and entered the Silver Hall
to take her place at the Grand Ducal table.</p>

<p>That was unheard of&mdash;and at the same time, after all
that had gone before, so logically consequential, that any
surprise or disgust would have been idiotic. The motto for
the day was to be prepared for anything in the way of omens
and phenomena. But after supper, when the Grand Duke
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_312" title="312"> </a>
had withdrawn and <ins title="Princes">Princess</ins> Griseldis had opened the cotillon
with a Chamberlain, expectation was again raised to fever
point, for the general question was, had the Prince been
allowed to present Miss Spoelmann with a bouquet? His instructions
had obviously been not to give her the first. He
had first given one each to his Aunt Catherine and a red-haired
cousin; but he had then advanced towards Imma Spoelmann
with a bouquet of lilac from the Court gardens. As
she was about to raise the lovely bunch to her nose, she had
hesitated for some unknown reason with a look of apprehension,
and it was not till he had encouraged her with a laugh
and a nod that she decided to test the fragrance of the
bouquet. Then they had danced and chatted quietly together
for a long time.</p>

<p>And yet it was during this dance that that unnoticed
duologue, that conversation of a palpably bourgeois tenor and
practical result, had taken place&mdash;and this is what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied this time, Imma, with the flowers I bring
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Prince, your lilac is lovely and smells quite
as it should. I love it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Imma? But I'm sorry for the poor rose-bush down
in the court, because its roses disgust you with their mouldy
smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't say that they disgust me, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they disenchant and chill you, don't they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have I ever told you of the popular belief that the
rose-bush will one day be redeemed, on a day of general happiness,
and will bear roses which will add to their great
beauty the gift of a lovely natural scent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Prince, we'll have to wait for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Imma, we must help and act! We must decide, and
have done with all hesitation, little Imma! Tell me&mdash;tell
me to-day&mdash;have you confidence in me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Prince. I have gained confidence in you latterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_313" title="313"> </a>&ldquo;There you are! Thank heaven! Didn't I say that I must
succeed in the long run? And so you think now that I am
in earnest, real, serious earnest about you and about us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Prince; latterly I have thought that I can think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, at last, irresolute little Imma! Oh, how I thank
you, I thank you! But in that case you're not afraid, and
will let the whole world know that you belong to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them know that you belong to me, Royal Highness,
if it's all the same to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will, Imma, loudly and surely. But only on one
condition, namely, that we don't only think of our own happiness
in a selfish and frivolous way, but regard it all from
the point of view of the Mass, the Whole. For the public
weal and our happiness, you see, are interdependent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, Prince. For without our studies of the public
weal I should have found it difficult to decide to have confidence
in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And without you, Imma, to warm my heart, I should have
found it difficult to tackle such practical problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right; then we'll see what we can do, each in our own
place. You with your folk and I&mdash;with my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he answered quietly, and pressed her more
closely to him in the dance. &ldquo;Little bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly a peculiar plighting of troth.</p>

<p>To be frank, everything was not yet settled, or nearly
settled. Looking back, one must say that, if one factor in
the whole had been altered or removed, the whole would
have been in imminent danger of coming to nothing. What
a blessing, the chronicler feels tempted to cry, what a blessing
that there was a man at the head of affairs who faced
the music firmly and undaunted, indeed not without a dash
of rashness, and did not judge a thing to be impossible just
because it had never happened before.</p>

<p>The conversation which Excellency von Knobelsdorff had
about eight days after the memorable Court Ball with Grand
Duke Albrecht&nbsp;II in the Old Schloss belongs to the history
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_314" title="314"> </a>
of the times. The day before, the President of Council had
presided over a session of the Cabinet, about which the <i>Courier</i>
had been in the position to report that questions of finance
and the private affairs of the Grand Ducal family had been
discussed, and further&mdash;added the newspaper in spaced type&mdash;that
complete unanimity of opinion had been reached among
the Ministers. So Herr von Knobelsdorff found himself in a
strong position towards his young Monarch at the audience;
for he had not only the swarming mass of the people, but
also the unanimous will of the Government at his back.</p>

<p>The conversation in Albrecht's draughty study took scarcely
less time than that in the little yellow room at Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage.&rdquo;
A pause was made while the Grand Duke had a
lemonade and Herr von Knobelsdorff a glass of port and
biscuits. The long duration of the conversation was due
only to the importance of the material to be discussed, not
to the Monarch's opposition; for Albrecht raised none. In
his close frock-coat, with his thin, sensitive hands crossed
on his lap, his proud, refined head with its pointed beard and
narrow temples raised and his eyelids sunk, he sucked gently
with his lower lip against his upper, and accompanied Herr
von Knobelsdorff's remarks with an occasional slight nod,
which expressed agreement and disagreement at the same time,
an uninterested formal agreement without prejudice to his
unassailable personal dignity.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff plunged straight into the middle
of things, and spoke about Prince Klaus Heinrich's visits to
Schloss Delphinenort. Albrecht knew of them. A subdued
echo of the events which kept the city and the country on
tip-toe had penetrated even into his loneliness; he knew, too,
his brother Klaus Heinrich, who had &ldquo;rummaged&rdquo; and gossiped
with the lackeys, and, then he knocked his forehead against the
big table, had wept for sympathy with his forehead&mdash;and in
effect he needed no coaching. Lisping and reddening slightly,
he gave Herr von Knobelsdorff to understand this, and added
that, seeing that the other had not intervened, but had caused
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_315" title="315"> </a>
the millionaire's daughter to be introduced to him, he concluded
that Herr von Knobelsdorff approved of the Prince's
behaviour, although he, the Grand Duke, could not clearly see
what it would lead to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Government,&rdquo; answered Herr von Knobelsdorff, &ldquo;would
set itself in prejudicial and estranging opposition to the will
of the people if it thwarted the Prince's projects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has my brother, then, definite projects?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a long time,&rdquo; corrected Herr von Knobelsdorff, &ldquo;he
acted without any plan and merely as his heart dictated; but
since he has found himself with the people on terms of
reality, his wishes have taken a practical form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of which means that the public approves the steps
taken by the Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it acclaims them, Royal Highness&mdash;that its dearest
hopes are fixed on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Herr von Knobelsdorff unrolled once more the
dark picture of the state of the country, of its distress, of
the serious embarrassment. Where was a remedy to be
found? Yonder, only yonder, in the Town Park, in the
second centre of the city, in the house of the invalid Money-Prince,
our guest and resident, round whose person the people
wove their dreams, and for whom it would be a small matter
to put an end to all our difficulties. It he could be induced
to take upon himself our national finances, their recovery
would be assured. Would he be induced? But fate had
ordained an exchange of sympathy between the mighty man's
only daughter and Prince Klaus Heinrich. And was this
wise and gracious ordinance to be flouted? Ought one for
the sake of mulish, out-of-date traditions to prevent a union
which embraced so immeasurable a blessing for the country
and its people? For that it did was a necessary hypothesis,
from which the union must draw its justification and validity.
But if this condition were fulfilled, if Samuel Spoelmann were
ready, not to mince words, to finance the State, then this union
was not only admissible, it was necessary, it was salvation,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_316" title="316"> </a>
the welfare of the State demanded it, and prayers rose to
heaven for it, far beyond the frontiers, wherever any interest
was felt in the restoration of our finances and the avoidance
of an economic panic.</p>

<p>At this point the Grand Duke asked a question quietly,
with a mocking smile and without looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the succession to the throne?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law,&rdquo; answered Herr von Knobelsdorff, unshaken,
&ldquo;places it in your Royal Highness's hand to put aside dynastic
scruples. With us the grant of an advance in rank and even
of equal birth belongs to the prerogatives of the monarch,
and when could history show a more potent motive for the
exercise of these privileges? This union bears the mark of
its own genuineness, preparations have been long in making
for its reception in the heart of the people, and your entire
princely and State approval would signify to the people nothing
more than an outward satisfaction of their inmost convictions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Herr von Knobelsdorff went on to speak of Imma
Spoelmann's popularity, of the significant demonstration in
connexion with her recovery from a slight indisposition, of
the position of equal birth which this exceptional person
assumed in popular fancy&mdash;and the wrinkles played round
his eyes as he reminded Albrecht of the old prophecy current
among the people, which told of a prince who would
give the country more with one hand than others had given
it with two, and eloquently demonstrated how the union between
Klaus Heinrich and Spoelmann's daughter must seem
to the people the fulfilment of the oracle, and thus God's will
and right and proper.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff said a great deal more which was
clever, honest, and good. He alluded to the fourfold mixture
of blood in Imma Spoelmann&mdash;for besides the Anglo-Saxon,
Portuguese and German, some drops of ancient Indian
blood were said to flow in her veins&mdash;and emphasized the fact
that he expected the dynasty to benefit greatly by the quickening
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_317" title="317"> </a>
effect of the mixture of races on ancient stocks. But the
artless old gentleman made his greatest effect when he talked
about the huge and beneficial alterations which would be
caused in the economical state of the Court itself, our debt-laden
and sore-pressed Court, through the heir to the throne's
bold marriage.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Albrecht sucked most proudly at
his upper lip. The value of gold was falling, the out-goings
were increasing&mdash;increasing in pursuance of an economic law
which held for the Court finances just as much as for every
private household; and there was no possibility of increasing
the revenues. But it was not right that the monarch's means
should be inferior to those of many of his subjects; it was
from the monarch's point of view intolerable that soap-boiler
Unschlitt's house should have had central heating a long time
ago, but that the Old Schloss should not have got it yet. A
remedy was necessary, in more than one way, and lucky was
the princely house to which so grand a remedy as this offered
itself.</p>

<p>It was noteworthy in our times that all the old-time modesty
as to busying oneself in the financial concerns of the Court
had vanished. That self-renunciation with which princely
families used formerly to make the heaviest sacrifices, so as to
keep the public from disenchanting glimpses into their
financial affairs, was no longer to be found, and law-suits and
questionable sales were the order of the day. But was not
an alliance with sovereign riches preferable to this petty and
bourgeois kind of device&mdash;a union which would exalt the
monarch for ever high above all economic worries and place
him in a position to reveal himself to the people with all those
outward signs for which they longed?</p>

<p>So ran Herr von Knobelsdorff's questions, which he himself
answered with an unqualified Yes! In short, his speech
was so clever and so irresistible that he did not leave the
Old Schloss without taking with him consents and authorizations,
delivered to him with a proud lisp, which were quite
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_318" title="318"> </a>
comprehensive enough to warrant unprecedented conclusions,
if only Miss Spoelmann had done her share.</p>

<p>And so things ran their memorable course to a happy
conclusion. Even before the end of December names were
mentioned of people who had seen (not only heard tell of)
Lord Marshal von Bühl zu Bühl in a fur coat, a top-hat on
his brown head, and his gold pince-nez on his nose, get out
of a Court carriage at Delphinenort, at 11 o'clock on a snow-dark
morning, and disappear waddling into the Schloss. At
the beginning of January there were individuals going about
the town who swore that the man who, this time also in the
morning and in fur coat and top-hat, had passed by the
grinning negro in plush, through the door of Delphinenort,
and, with feverish haste, had flung himself into a cab which
was waiting for him, was undoubtedly our Finance Minister,
Dr. Krippenreuther. And at the same time there appeared in
the semi-official <i>Courier</i> the first preparatory notices of rumours
touching an impending betrothal in the Grand Ducal House&mdash;tentative
notifications which, becoming carefully clearer and
clearer, at last exhibited the two names, Klaus Heinrich and
Imma Spoelmann, in clear print next each other&hellip;. It
was no new collocation, but to see it in black on white had
the same effect as strong wine.</p>

<p>It was most absorbing to notice what attitude, in the
journalistic discussions which ensued, our enlightened and
open-minded press took up towards the popular aspect of the
affair, namely, the prophecy, which had won too great political
significance not to demand education and intelligence to deal
satisfactorily with it. Sooth-saying, chiromancy, and similar
magic, explained the <i>Courier</i>, were, so far as the destiny of
individuals was concerned, to be relegated to the murky regions
of superstition. They belonged to the grey middle ages, and
no ridicule was too severe for the idiots who (very rarely in
the cities nowadays) let experienced pick-pockets empty their
purses in return for reading, from their hands, the cards, or
coffee-grounds, their insignificant fortunes, or for invoking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_319" title="319"> </a>
sound health, for a hom&oelig;opathic cure, or for freeing their
sick cattle from invading demons&mdash;as if the Apostle had not
already asked: &ldquo;Doth God take care for oxen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, surveyed as a whole and restricted to decisive turns
in the destiny of whole nations or dynasties, the proposition
did not necessarily repel a well-trained and scientific mind,
that, as time is only an illusion and, truly viewed, all happenings
are stationary in eternity, such revolutions while still
in the lap of the future might give the human brain a premonitory
shock and reveal themselves palpably to it. And
in proof of this the zealous newspaper published an exhaustive
composition, kindly put at its disposal by one of our high-school
professors, which gave a conspectus of all the cases
in the history of mankind in which oracle and horoscope,
somnambulism, clairvoyance, dreams, sleep-walking, second-sight,
and inspiration had played a rôle, a most meritorious
production, which produced the due effect in cultured circles.</p>

<p>So press, Government, Court, and public closed their ranks
in complete understanding, and assuredly the <i>Courier</i> would
have held its tongue had its philosophical contributions been
premature and politically dangerous at that time&mdash;in a word,
had not the negotiations at Delphinenort already advanced far
in a favourable direction. It is pretty accurately known by
now how these negotiations developed, and what a difficult,
indeed painful, task our Counsel had in them: the Counsel,
to whom as proxy of the Court the delicate mission had fallen
of preparing the way for Prince Klaus Heinrich's courtship,
as well as the Chief Financial Assessor, who, notwithstanding
his infirm state of health, insisted on nursing his country's
interests by a personal interview with Samuel Spoelmann.</p>

<p>In this connexion account must be taken firstly of Mr.
Spoelmann's fiery and excitable disposition, and secondly of
the fact that to the prodigious little man a favourable termination
to the business from our point of view seemed far less
important than it did to us. Apart from Mr. Spoelmann's
love for his daughter, who had opened her heart to him and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_320" title="320"> </a>
told him of her pretty wish to make herself useful in her love,
our proxies had not one trump to play against him, and he
was the last man to whom Dr. Krippenreuther could dictate
conditions in virtue of what Herr von Bühl had to offer. Mr.
Spoelmann always spoke of Prince Klaus Heinrich as &ldquo;the
young man,&rdquo; and expressed so little pleasure at the prospect
of giving his daughter to a Royal Highness to wife, that Dr.
Krippenreuther, as well as Herr von Bühl, were more than
once plunged into deadly embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he'd only learnt something, had some respectable business,&rdquo;
he snarled peevishly. &ldquo;But a young man who only
knows how to get cheered&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; He was really furious, the
first time a remark was dropped about morganatic marriage.
His daughter, he declared once for all, was no concubine,
and would be no left-handed wife. Who marries her, marries
her&hellip;. But the interests of the dynasty and the country
coincided at this point with his own. The obtaining of issue
entitled to succeed was a necessity, and Herr von Bühl was
equipped with all the powers which Herr von Knobelsdorff
had succeeded in extracting from the Grand Duke. As for
Dr. Krippenreuther's mission, however, it owed its success not
to the envoy's eloquence, but simply to Mr. Spoelmann's
paternal affection, the complaisance of a suffering, weary
father, whose abnormal existence had long ago made him a
paradox, towards his only daughter and heiress, whom he
allowed to choose for herself the public funds in which she
wished to invest her fortune.</p>

<p>And so came into existence the agreements, which were at
first shrouded in deep secrecy and only came to light bit
by bit, as events developed themselves, though here they can
be summarized in a few plain words.</p>

<p>The betrothal of Klaus Heinrich with Imma Spoelmann
was approved and recognized by Samuel Spoelmann and by
the House of Grimmburg. Simultaneously with the publication
of the betrothal in the <i>Gazette</i> appeared the announcement
of the elevation of the bride to the rank of countess&mdash;under
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_321" title="321"> </a>
a fancy name of romantic sound, like that which Klaus
Heinrich had borne during his educational tour in the fair
southern lands; and on the day of their wedding the wife of
the heir-presumptive was to be given the dignity of a princess.
The two rises in rank, which might have cost four thousand
eight hundred marks, were to be free of duty.</p>

<p>The wedding was to be only preliminarily a left-handed
one, till the world had got used to it: for on the day on
which it appeared that the bride was to be blessed with offspring,
Albrecht&nbsp;II, in view of the unparalleled circumstances,
would declare his brother's morganatic wife to be of equal
birth, and would give her the rank of a princess of the Grand
Ducal House with the title of Royal Highness. The new
member of the ruling House would waive all claim to an
appanage. As for the Court ceremony, only a semi-Court was
appointed for the celebration of the left-handed marriage,
but a Processional Court, that highest and completest form
of showing allegiance, was fixed for the celebration of the
declaration of equal birth. Samuel Spoelmann, for his part,
granted the State a loan of three hundred and fifty million
marks, and on such fatherly conditions that the loan showed
all the symptoms of being a gift.</p>

<p>It was the Grand Duke Albrecht who acquainted the Heir
Presumptive with these conclusions. Once more Klaus Heinrich
stood in the great, draughty study under the battered
ceiling-paintings, in front of his brother, as once before when
Albrecht had delegated to him his representative duties, and
standing in an official attitude received the great news. He
had put on the tunic of a major in the Fusiliers of the Guard
for this audience, while the Grand Duke had lately added to
his black frock-coat a pair of dark-red wool mittens, which
his aunt had made him to protect him from the draught
through the high windows of the Old Schloss.</p>

<p>When Albrecht had finished, Klaus Heinrich stepped one
pace sideways, closed his heels with a fresh salute, and said:
&ldquo;I beg, dear Albrecht, to offer my heart-felt and respectful
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_322" title="322"> </a>
thanks, in my own name and that of the whole country. For
it is you in the long run who make all these blessings possible,
and the redoubled love of the people will be your
reward for your magnanimous resolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pressed his brother's thin, sensitive hand, which he kept
close to his chest, and extended to him only to the extent
of moving his forearm. The Grand Duke had thrust forward
his short, round underlip, and his eyelids were half-closed.
He answered softly with a lisp:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the less inclined to entertain illusions about the
people's love, as I can, as you know, dispense with such
questionable love without a pang. So question whether I
deserve it is scarcely worth notice. When it's time to start,
I go to the station and give the signal to the engine-driver,
which is silly rather than dutiful, but it's my duty. But you're
in a different position. You're a Sunday child. Everything
turns out trumps for you&hellip;. I wish you luck,&rdquo; he said,
raising the lids from his lonely-looking, blue eyes. And it
was clear at this moment that he loved Klaus Heinrich. &ldquo;I
wish you happiness, Klaus Heinrich&mdash;but not too much, and
that you may not repose too comfortably in the love of the
people. I have already said that everything turns out trumps
for you. The girl of your choice is very strange, very undomesticated,
and, most important of all, very original. She
has a mixture of blood, I've been told that Indian blood flows
in her veins. That's perhaps a good thing. With a wife like
that, there's less danger, perhaps, of your having too easy a
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither happiness,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich, &ldquo;nor the people's
love will have the effect of making me cease to be your
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left to face a difficult interview, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Mr.
Spoelmann, his personal proposal for Imma's hand. He
found he had to swallow what his negotiators had swallowed,
for Samuel Spoelmann showed not the smallest pleasure and
snarled several refreshing truths at him. But it was over at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_323" title="323"> </a>
last, and the morning came when the betrothal appeared in
the <i>Gazette</i>. The long tensions resolved into endless jubilation.
Dignified men waved pocket-handkerchiefs at one another,
and embraced in the open square: bunting flew from
every flag-staff.</p>

<p>But the same day the news reached Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo;
that Raoul Ueberbein had committed suicide.</p>

<p>The story was a vile as well as stupid one, and would
not be worth relating had not its end been so horrible. No
attempt will be made here to apportion the blame. The Doctor's
death gave rise to two opposing factions. One affirmed
that he had been driven to take his life owing to the misgivings
which his desperate act had evoked: the others declared
with a shrug that his conduct was impossible and crazy, and
that he had shown all his life a total lack of self-control.
The point need not be decided. At any rate nothing justified
so tragic an end; indeed, a man with the gifts of Raoul
Ueberbein deserved something better than ruin&hellip;. Here is
the story.</p>

<p>At Easter the year before the professor in charge of the
top class but one at our Grammar School, who suffered from
heart-weakness, had been temporarily retired on the ground of
his illness, and Doctor Ueberbein, notwithstanding his comparative
youth, had been given the first vacant chair simply
in view of his professional zeal and his undeniably remarkable
success in a lower class. It was a happy experiment, as
events proved; the class had never done so well as this year.
The professor on leave, a popular man with his colleagues, had
become a peevish as well as careless and indolent man as the
result of his infirmity, with which was combined a sociable
but immoderate inclination for beer. He had shut his eyes
to details and had sent up every year an extremely badly
prepared batch of pupils into the Select. A new spirit had
come into the class with the temporary professor, and nobody
was surprised at it. People knew his uncomfortable professional
zeal, his single-minded and never-resting energy.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_324" title="324"> </a>
They foresaw that he would not miss such an opportunity
for self-advancement, round which he had doubtless built
ambitious hopes.</p>

<p>So an end had soon been put to laziness and boredom in
the second class. Dr. Ueberbein had pitched his expectations
high, and his skill in inspiring even the most recalcitrant had
proved irresistible. The boys worshipped him. His superior,
fatherly, and jolly, swaggering way kept them on the alert,
shook them up, and made them feel it a point of honour to
follow their teacher through thick and thin. He won their
hearts by going for Sunday excursions with them, when they
were allowed to smoke, while he bewitched their imaginations
by boyishly conceived rodomontades about the greatness and
severity of public life. And on Monday the members of
yesterday's expedition would meet for work in a cheerful and
eager frame of mind.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the school year had thus passed, when
the news went round, before Christmas, that the professor
on leave, now fairly strong again, would resume his duties
after the holidays, and would again act as professor of the
second class. And now it came out what sort of man Doctor
Ueberbein was, with his green complexion and superior manner.
He objected and remonstrated; he lodged a vigorous
and, in form, not incontestable protest against the class with
which he had spent three-quarters of the year, and whose
work and recreation he had shared up to the very mouth of
the goal, being taken from its professor for the last quarter
and restored to the official who had spent three-quarters of
the year on leave. His action was intelligible and comprehensible,
and one must sympathize with it. He had undoubtedly
hoped to send up a model class to the head master,
who taught the Select, a class whose forwardness would put
his skill in the best light and would hasten his promotion;
and it must grieve him to look forward to another's reaping
the fruits of his devotion. But though his disgust might be
excusable, his frenzy was not: and it is an unfortunate fact
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_325" title="325"> </a>
that, when the head master proved deaf to his representations,
he became simply frenzied. He lost his head, he lost all
balance, he set heaven and hell to work to prevent this loafer,
this alcohol-heart, this blankety-blank, as he did not hesitate
to describe the professor on leave, from taking his class from
him. And when he found no support among his colleagues,
as was natural in the case of so unsociable a man, the poor
wretch had so far forgotten himself as to incite the pupils
entrusted to him to rebel.</p>

<p>He had put the question to them from his desk&mdash;Whom do
you want for your master for the last quarter, me or that
other fellow? And, wound up by his stirring appeal, they
had shouted that they wanted him. Then, he said, they must
take matters into their own hands, show their colours, and act
as one boy&mdash;though goodness knows what in his excitement he
meant by that. But when after the holidays the returned
professor entered the class-room, they screamed Doctor Ueberbein's
name at him for minutes on end&mdash;and there was a fine
scandal.</p>

<p>It was kept as quiet as possible. The revolutionaries got
off almost unpunished, as Doctor Ueberbein himself put on
record, at the inquiry which was at once initiated, his appeal to
them. As to the Doctor himself, too, the authorities seemed
generally inclined to close their eyes to what had happened.
His zeal and skill were highly valued, certain learned works,
the fruits of his mighty industry, had made his name known,
he was popular in high quarters&mdash;quarters, be it noticed, with
which he personally did not come into contact, and which
therefore he could not incense by his patronizing bearing.
Further, his record as tutor of Prince Klaus Heinrich weighed
in the scales. In short, he was not simply dismissed, as one
might have expected him to be. The President of the Grand
Ducal Council of Education, before whom the matter came,
administered a grave reprimand to him, and Doctor Ueberbein,
who had stopped teaching directly after the scandal, was provisionally
retired. But people who knew declared later that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_326" title="326"> </a>
nothing was intended beyond the professor's transfer to another
grammar school; that in high quarters the only wish was
to hush up the whole business, and that the promise of a
brilliant future had been actually extended to the Doctor.
Everything would have turned out all right.</p>

<p>But the milder the authorities showed themselves towards
the Doctor, the more hostile was the attitude of his colleagues
towards him. The &ldquo;Teachers' Union&rdquo; at once established a
court of honour, whose object was to secure satisfaction for
their beloved member, the alcohol-hearted professor rejected
of his pupils. The written statement laid before Ueberbein
in his retirement in his lodgings ran as follows: Whereas
Ueberbein had resisted the return of the colleague for whom
he acted to the professorship of the second class; whereas
further he had agitated against him and in the end had
actually incited the pupils to insubordination against him, he
had been guilty of disloyal conduct to his colleague of such
a kind as must be considered dishonourable not only in a
professional, but also in a general sense. That was the
verdict. The expected result was that Doctor Ueberbein, who
had only been a nominal member of the &ldquo;Teachers' Union,&rdquo;
withdrew his membership&mdash;and there, so many thought, he
might well have let the matter rest.</p>

<p>But whether it was that in his seclusion he did not know
the goodwill he inspired in higher quarters; that he thought
his prospects more hopeless than they were; that he could
not stand idleness, unreconciled as he was to the premature
loss of his beloved class; that the expression &ldquo;dishonourable&rdquo;
poisoned his blood, or that his mind was not strong enough
to stand all the shocks it received at this time: five weeks
after the New Year his landlady found him on the thread-bare
carpet of his room, no greener than usual, but with a
bullet through his heart.</p>

<p>Such was the end of Raoul Ueberbein, such his false step,
such the cause of his fall. &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; was the burden
of all the discussions of his pitiful break-down. The quarrelsome
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_327" title="327"> </a>
and uncongenial man, who had never been a man
amongst men at his club, who had haughtily resisted
familiarity, and had ordered his life cold-bloodedly with a
view to results alone, and had supposed that that gave him
the right to patronize the whole world&mdash;there he lay now:
the first hitch, the first obstacle in the field of accomplishment,
had brought him to a miserable end. Few of the
bourgeois regretted, none of them mourned him&mdash;with one
single exception, the chief surgeon at the Dorothea Hospital,
Ueberbein's congenial friend, and perhaps a fair lady with
whom he used once to play Casino. But Klaus Heinrich
always cherished an honourable and cordial memory of his
ill-fated tutor.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_328" title="328"> </a>IX<br/>
<small>THE ROSE-BUSH</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">And</span> Spoelmann financed the state. The outlines of the
transaction were bold and clear; a child could have understood
them&mdash;and as a fact beaming fathers explained it to
their children, as they dangled them on their knees.</p>

<p>Samuel Spoelmann nodded, Messrs. Phlebs and Slippers
got to work, and his mighty orders flashed under the waves
of the Atlantic to the Continent of the Western Hemisphere.
He withdrew a third of his share from the Sugar trust, a
quarter from the Petroleum trust, and half from the Steel
trust; he had his floating capital paid in to accounts in his
name in several banks over here; and he bought from Herr
Krippenreuther at par 350,000,000 new 3½ per cent. consols
at one stroke. That is what Spoelmann did.</p>

<p>He who knows by experience the influence of the state of
mind on the human organs will believe that Dr. Krippenreuther
cheered up and in a short time was unrecognizable.
He carried himself upright and free, his walk was springy,
the yellow look faded from his face, which became red and
white, his eyes flashed, and his stomach regained its powers
in a few months to such an extent that his friends were delighted
to observe that the Minister could give himself up to
the enjoyment of blue cabbage and gherkin salad with impunity.
That was one pleasant though purely personal result
of Spoelmann's interference in our finances, which was of but
slight account in comparison with the effects which that interference
had on our public and economic life.</p>

<p>A part of the loan was devoted to the sinking fund, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_329" title="329"> </a>
troublesome public debts were paid off. But this was scarcely
needed to secure us breathing space and credit on every side;
for no sooner was it known, for all the secrecy with which
the matter was treated officially, that Samuel Spoelmann had
become the State banker, in fact if not in name, than the skies
cleared up above us and all our need was changed into joy
and rapture. There was an end to the scare-selling of active
debts, the customary rate of interest dropped, our written
promises were eagerly sought after as investments, and each
twenty-four hours saw a rise in the quotation of our high-interest
loan from a deplorably low figure up to above par.
The pressure, the nightmare which for decades had weighed
down our national finances, was removed; Doctor Krippenreuther
puffed out his chest and spoke in the Landtag in favour
of all-round reduction in taxation. This was adopted
unanimously, and the antediluvian meat tax was finally buried
amid the rejoicings of all those who cared for their fellow-men.</p>

<p>A distinct improvement in the pay of the Civil Service, and
in the salaries of teachers, clergymen, and all State functionaries
was readily voted. Means were now available for
restarting the closed-down silver-mines; several hundred workmen
were given work, and productive veins were unexpectedly
struck. Money, money was forthcoming, the standard of
economic morality rose; the forests were replanted, the litter
was left in the woods, the stock-owners no longer were compelled
to sell their milk, they drank it themselves, and the
critics would have sought in vain for ill-nourished peasants
in the fields. The nation showed gratitude towards their
rulers, who had brought so boundless a blessing to land and
people.</p>

<p>Herr von Knobelsdorff needed but few words to induce
Parliament to increase the Crown subsidy. The orders for
the putting up for sale of the Schlosses &ldquo;Pastime&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Favourite&rdquo; were cancelled. Skilled workmen invaded the
Old Schloss, to instal central heating from top to bottom.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_330" title="330"> </a>
Our agents in the negotiations with Spoelmann, von Bühl and
Dr. Krippenreuther, received the Grand Cross of the Albrechts
Order in brilliants; the Finance Minister was also ennobled,
and Herr von Knobelsdorff was made happy with a life-size
portrait of the exalted couple&mdash;painted by the skilful hand of
old Professor von Lindemann and exquisitely framed.</p>

<p>After the betrothal the people gave rein to their fancy in
calculating the dowry which Imma Spoelmann was to receive
from her father. It made them giddy; they were possessed
by a mad desire to scatter figures of truly astronomical dimensions
about. But the dowry did not exceed an earthly figure,
comfortably big though it was. It amounted to a hundred
million.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Ditlinde zu Ried-Hohenried, when she first
heard it. &ldquo;And my dear Philipp with his peat.&rdquo; Many another
had the same thought; but Spoelmann's daughter
allayed the nervous anger which might arise in simple hearts
in face of such monstrous wealth, for she did not forget to do
good and share her good fortune, and on the very day of the
public betrothal she gave a sum of 500,000 marks, the yearly
interest on which was to be divided among the four county
councils for charitable and generally useful purposes.</p>

<p>Klaus Heinrich and Imma drove in one of Spoelmann's
olive-coloured, red-cushioned motors on a round of visits to
the members of the House of Grimmburg. A young chauffeur
drove the sumptuous car&mdash;the one in which Imma had found
a likeness to Klaus Heinrich. But his nervous tension was
but small on this trip, for he had to restrain the motor's giant
strength so far as possible and go slowly&mdash;so closely were
they surrounded by admiring crowds; for as the more remote
authors of our happiness, Grand Duke Albrecht and Samuel
Spoelmann, each in his own fashion, concealed themselves
from the crowd, the latter heaped all its love and gratitude
on the heads of the exalted couple. Boys could be seen
through the plate glass of the motor throwing their caps in
the air, the shouts of men and women came surging in, clear
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_331" title="331"> </a>
and shrill, and Klaus Heinrich, his hand to his helmet, said
admonishingly: &ldquo;You must respond too, Imma, to your side,
otherwise they'll think you cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove to Princess Katharine's, and were received with
dignity. In the time of Grand Duke Johann Albrecht, her
brother, said the aunt to her nephew, it would never have
been allowed. But the times moved fast, and she prayed
Heaven that his betrothed would accustom herself to the
Court. They proceeded to Princess zu Ried-Hohenried's, and
there it was love she met with. Ditlinde's Grimmburg pride
found comfort in the assurance that Leviathan's daughter
might become Princess of the Grand Ducal House and Royal
Highness, but could never be Grand Ducal Princess like herself;
for the rest, she was overjoyed that Klaus Heinrich had
rummaged out for himself anything so sweet and precious.
As the wife of Philipp with his peat, she had the best reasons
for knowing how to value the advantages of the match, and
cordially welcomed her sister-in-law to her arms.</p>

<p>They drove too to Prince Lambert's villa, and while the
Countess-bride struggled to keep up a conversation with the
dazzling but very uneducated Baroness von Rohrdorf, the old
petticoat-hunter congratulated his nephew in his sepulchral
voice on the unprejudiced choice he had made, and on so
boldly snapping his fingers at Court and Highness. &ldquo;I am
not snapping my fingers at my Highness, uncle; not only have
I had an eye to my own happiness in no inconsiderable
measure, but I have acted throughout with the Mass, the
Whole, in view,&rdquo; said Klaus Heinrich rather rudely; whereupon
they broke off, and drove to Schloss &ldquo;Segenhaus,&rdquo; where
Dorothea, the poor Dowager, held her dreary Court. She
cried as she kissed the young bride on the forehead, without
knowing why she did so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Samuel Spoelmann sat at Delphinenort surrounded
with plans and sketches of furniture and silk carpet-patterns,
and drawings of gold plate. He left his organ untouched,
and forgot the stone in his kidney, and got quite red
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_332" title="332"> </a>
cheeks from merely having so much to do; for however small
the opinion he had formed of &ldquo;the young man,&rdquo; or the hope
he held out of his ever being seen at Court, yet his daughter
was going to be married, and he wanted the arrangements to
be worthy of his means. The plans had to do with the new
Schloss &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; for Klaus Heinrich's bachelor quarters
were to be razed to the ground, and a new Schloss built on
its site, roomy and bright and decorated, by Klaus Heinrich's
wish, in a mixture of Empire and modern styles, combining
cool severity with homely comfort. Mr. Spoelmann appeared
one morning in person, after drinking the waters in the spa-garden,
in his faded great-coat at the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; in order
to find out whether this or that piece of furniture could be
used for the new Schloss. &ldquo;Let's see, young Prince, what
you've got,&rdquo; he snarled, and Klaus Heinrich showed him everything
in his sober room&mdash;the thin sofas, the stiff-legged tables,
the white-enamelled tables in the corners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gimcrack,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoelmann, &ldquo;no use for anything.&rdquo;
Three arm-chairs only in the little yellow room, of heavy
mahogany, with snail-shaped convolute arms and the yellow
covers embroidered with blue lyres, found favour in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can put those in an ante-room,&rdquo; he said, and Klaus
Heinrich was relieved that these arm-chairs should be contributed
to the furnishing by the Grimmburg side; for of
course it would have been rather painful to him if Mr.
Spoelmann had had to find every single thing.</p>

<p>But the ragged park and flower-garden at the &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo;
had to be cleared and restocked; the flower-garden in particular
was honoured with a special ornament which Klaus
Heinrich had asked his brother to give him as a wedding-present.
For it was arranged that the rose-bush from the Old
Schloss should be transplanted to the big middle bed in front
of the approach; and then, no longer surrounded by mouldy
walls, but in the air and sunshine and the stiffest clay obtainable,
it should be seen what sort of roses it could bear in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_333" title="333"> </a>
future&mdash;and give the lie to the popular report, if it were
obstinate and arrogant enough.</p>

<p>And when March and April had passed, May came, bringing
the great event of Klaus Heinrich's and Imma's marriage.
It was a glorious day, with golden clouds in the sky, and its
dawn was greeted by a choir from the town-hall tower. The
people streamed in on foot and in carts, that fair, thick-set,
healthy, reliable stock with blue, meditative eyes and broad,
high cheek-bones, dressed in the handsome national dress&mdash;the
men in red jackets, top-boots, and broad-brimmed black-velvet
hats, the women in brightly embroidered bodices, thick,
wide skirts, and big black veils as a head-dress. They joined
the throng of town-folk in the streets between the Spa-Garden
and the Old Schloss, which had been transformed into a processional
route with garlands and wreathed stands and white-enamelled
poles covered with flowers.</p>

<p>Banners of the Trades Unions, rifle-corps, and gymnastic
associations began early in the morning to be carried through
the streets. The fire brigade turned out in gleaming helmets.
The officers of the Corps of Students drove round in open
landaus in full state with banners flying. Maids of Honour
in white, with rose-twined staves, stood about in groups. The
offices and factories were deserted, the schools closed, festival
services were held in the churches. And the morning editions
of the <i>Courier</i> and <i>Gazette</i> contained, in addition to cordial
leading articles, the announcement of a comprehensive amnesty,
in pursuance of which cancellation or remission of
sentence was granted to several prisoners by the grace of the
Grand Duke. Even the murderer Gudebus, who had been condemned
to death, and then to penal servitude for life, was
released on ticket of leave. But he soon had to be put back
into prison again.</p>

<p>Two o'clock was the hour fixed for the City Council's
luncheon in the hall of the Museum, with an orchestra and
telegrams of respectful congratulations. But the public made
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_334" title="334"> </a>
merry outside the gates, with fried chips and currant-loaf, a
fair, lucky-booths and shooting galleries, sack-races, and
men's climbing competitions for treacle cakes. And then
came the moment when Imma Spoelmann drove from Delphinenort
to the Old Schloss. She did so in processional
pomp.</p>

<p>The banners fluttered in the spring breeze, the thick garlands,
interwoven with red roses, stretched from one pole to
another, the crowd was packed in a black mass on the
balconies, roofs, and steps; and between the fences of rifle-corps
and firemen, guilds, unions, students, and school-children,
the bridal procession advanced slowly amid tumultuous
uproar along the sand-strewn road. Two out-riders in
laced hats and shoulder-knots, preceded by a moustachioed
equerry in a three-cornered hat, came first. Then came a
four-horsed carriage, in which the Grand Ducal Commissary,
an official of the Board of Green Cloth, who had been deputed
to fetch the bride, rode with a chamberlain. Next a second
four-horsed carriage, in which sat the Countess Löwenjoul,
looking askance at the two maids of honour in the carriage
with her, whose morals she mistrusted. Then came ten postilions
on horseback, in yellow breeches and blue coats, who
played: &ldquo;We wind for thee the maiden's wreath.&rdquo; Then
twelve girls in white, who strewed roses and sprigs of arbor
vitæ on the road.</p>

<p>And lastly, followed by fifty master-mechanics on powerful
horses, the six-horsed transparent bridal coach. The red-faced
coachman in the laced hat proudly extended his gaitered legs
on the high white-velvet box, holding the reins with arms
similarly extended; grooms in top-boots walked at the head
of each pair of horses, and two lackeys stood behind the
creaking carriage in great state, showing in their impenetrable
faces no signs that plotting and underhand dealing were part
of their daily life. Behind the glass and gilded window-frames
sat Imma Spoelmann in veil and wreath, with an old
Court lady as lady of honour at her side. Her dress of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_335" title="335"> </a>
shimmering silk glittered like snow in the sunshine, and on
her lap she held the white bouquet which Prince Klaus Heinrich
had sent her an hour before. Her strangely childlike
face was as pale as an ocean-pearl, and a smooth wisp of
dark hair fell across her forehead under the veil, while her
big black eyes threw glances of pleading eloquence over the
close-packed throng. And what was that din, that barking
close by the coach-door? It was Percival, the collie, more
beside himself than anyone had ever seen him. The confusion
and the slow pace at which the procession went excited him
beyond measure, robbed him of all self-restraint, and convulsed
him almost beyond bearance. He raged, he danced,
he leaped, he circled blindly round and round in the intoxication
of his nerves, and the shouts redoubled in the balconies
and street and on the roofs on both sides as the people recognized
him.</p>

<p>That is how Imma Spoelmann drove to the Old Schloss,
and the boom and buzz of the bells mingled with the cheers
of the people and Percival's mad bark. The procession
crossed the Albrechtsplatz at a walk and went through the
Albrechtstor. In the Courtyard of the Schloss the mounted
corps of the guilds rode to one side, and took up their position
as a guard of honour, and in the corridor, in front of
the weather-beaten front door, Grand Duke Albrecht, dressed
as a Colonel of Hussars, received the bride with his brother
and the rest of his House, offered her his arm and conducted
her up the grey stone steps into the state-rooms, at whose
doors guards of honour were posted and in which the Court
was assembled. The princesses of the House stayed in the
Hall of the Knights, and it was there that Herr von Knobelsdorff,
surrounded by the Grand Ducal family, executed the
civil marriage. Never, it was said later, had the wrinkles
played round his eyes more lively than whilst he joined
Klaus Heinrich and Imma Spoelmann in civil wedlock.
When this was over, Albrecht&nbsp;II commanded that the church
festivities should begin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_336" title="336"> </a>Herr von Bühl zu Bühl had done his best to get together
an imposing procession&mdash;the bridal procession, which passed
up Heinrich the Luxurious's staircase and along a covered
way into the Court Chapel. Stooping under the weight of
years, yet in a brown toupée and with a youthful waddle, he
marched, covered with orders down to his waist and planting
his long staff in front of him, in front of the chamberlains,
who walked along in silk stockings with their feather hats
under their arms and a key embroidered on their coat-tails.
The young pair drew near; the foreign-looking bride in a
shimmer of white and Klaus Heinrich, the Heir Presumptive,
in a Grenadier uniform with the yellow ribbon across his
chest and back. Four maidens belonging to the nobility of
the land, with demure looks, carried Imma Spoelmann's train,
accompanied by Countess Löwenjoul, who looked suspiciously
out of the corners of her eyes. Behind the bridegroom walked
Herr von Schulenburg-Tressen and Herr von Braunbart-Schellendorf.
The Master of the Royal Hunt, von Stieglitz,
and the ballet-loving Grand Duke walked in front of the
young monarch, who sucked quietly at his upper lip. At
his side came Aunt Catherine, followed by the Minister of
the Household, von Knobelsdorff, the Adjutant, the princely
zu Ried-Hohenried couple, and the remaining members of the
House. The rear of the procession was brought up by more
chamberlains.</p>

<p>Inside the Court Chapel, which was decorated with plants
and draperies, the invited guests had awaited the procession.
There were diplomats with their wives, the Court and county
nobility, the corps of officers in the capital, the Ministers,
amongst them the beaming face of Herr von Krippenreuther,
the Knights of the Grand Order of the Grimmburg Griffin,
the Presidents of the Landtag, and all sorts of dignitaries.
And as the Lord Marshal had ordered invitations to be sent
to every class of society, the seats were filled with tradesmen,
countrymen, and simple artisans with hearts attuned to the
event. In front of the altar the relations of the bridegroom
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_337" title="337"> </a>
took their places in a semicircle in red-velvet arm-chairs.
The voices of the choir rang pure and sweet under the vaulted
ceiling, and then the whole congregation sang a hymn of
thanksgiving with full organ accompaniment. When it died
away, the musical voice of the President of the High Consistory,
Dom Wislezenus, was heard, as with his silver hair,
and a convex star on his silk gown, he stood before the exalted
pair and preached an eloquent sermon. He built it on a
theme, to borrow a musical expression. And the theme was
the passage from the Psalms which runs: &ldquo;He shall live,
and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia.&rdquo; There
was not a dry eye left in the chapel.</p>

<p>Then Dom Wislezenus completed the marriage, and at the
moment when the bridal pair exchanged rings, fanfares of
trumpets blared forth, and a salvo of three times twelve guns
began to roll over city and country-side, fired by the soldiers
on the wall of the &ldquo;Citadel.&rdquo; Directly afterwards the fire
brigade let off the town guns by way of salute; but long
pauses occurred between each detonation, giving rise to inexhaustible
laughter among the people.</p>

<p>After the blessing had been pronounced, the procession
re-formed and returned to the Hall of the Knights, where
the House of Grimmburg congratulated the newly married
pair. Then came the Court, and Klaus Heinrich and Imma
Spoelmann walked arm-in-arm through the Gala Rooms,
where the Court was drawn up, and spoke to various members
of the company, smiling across an interval of shining
parquet; and Imma pouted and wagged her head as she
spoke to anyone who curtsied low and answered deferentially.
After the Court there was a State supper in the Marble Hall,
and a Marshal's supper in that of the Twelve Months, and
everything was of the best that money could buy, out of regard
to what Klaus Heinrich's wife had been accustomed to.
Even Percival, now restored to his senses, was among the
guests, and was given some roast meat. After supper the students
and the populace had arranged in honour of the young
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_338" title="338"> </a>
couple a demonstration with serenades and a torchlight procession
on the Albrechtsplatz. The square outside was a
blaze of light, and resounded with shouts.</p>

<p>Lackeys drew aside the curtains from one of the windows
in the Silver Hall, and Klaus Heinrich and Imma advanced
to the open window. They threw it open, and stood in the
opening just as they were, for outside it was a warm spring
night. Next them, in a dignified attitude and looking most
imposing, sat Percival, the collie, and looked down like his
mistress.</p>

<p>Several of the town bands played in the illuminated square,
which was packed tight with human beings, and the upturned
faces of the people were lighted to a smoky dark red by the
students' torches as they marched past the Schloss. Cheers
broke forth when the newly married couple appeared at the
window. They bowed their thanks, and then stayed there
awhile, looking and letting themselves be looked at. The
people, looking up, could see their lips moving in conversation.
This is what they said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Imma, how thankful they are that we have not
forgotten their need and affliction. What crowds there are,
standing there and shouting up to us! Of course many of
them are scoundrels, and take each other in, and sadly need
to be elevated above the work-day and its reality. But they
are really grateful when one shows oneself conscious of their
need and affliction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we are so stupid and so lonely, Prince&mdash;on the peaks
of humanity, as Doctor Ueberbein used always to say&mdash;and
we know absolutely nothing of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, little Imma? What was it, then, which at last
gave you confidence in me, and brought us to study so
practically the public weal? Knows he nothing of life who
knows of love? That shall be our business in future: Highness
and Love&mdash;an austere happiness.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
