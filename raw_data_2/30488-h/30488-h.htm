<p>I swayed upon the gaudy stern</p>
<p>The butt end of a steering oar,</p>
<p>And everywhere that I could turn</p>
<p>Men ran upon the shore.</p>

<p class="s">And though I would have hushed the crowd</p>
<p>There was no mother&rsquo;s son but said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the figure in a shroud</p>
<p>Upon a gaudy bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">And fishes bubbling to the brim</p>
<p>Cried out upon that thing beneath,</p>
<p>It had such dignity of limb,</p>
<p>By the sweet name of Death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>2</span></p>

<p class="s">Though I&rsquo;d my finger on my lip,</p>
<p>What could I but take up the song?</p>
<p>And fish and crowd and gaudy ship</p>
<p>Cried out the whole night long,</p>

<p class="s">Crying amid the glittering sea,</p>
<p>Naming it with ecstatic breath,</p>
<p>Because it had such dignity</p>
<p>By the sweet name of Death.</p>

<p>Was done to make it plain;</p>

<p>With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll find so good a thing as that we have lost?</p>

<p>Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season</p>
<p>With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;</p>
<p>And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,</p>

<p>Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,</p>

<h3>THE GREEN HELMET</h3>

<h5><i>An Heroic Farce</i></h5>
<hr class="art" />

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Scene</span>: <i>A house made of logs. There
are two windows at the back and a door
which cuts off one of the corners of the
room. Through the door one can see low
rocks which make the ground outside
higher than it is within, and beyond the
rocks a misty moon-lit sea. Through the
windows one can see nothing but the sea.
There is a great chair at the opposite
side to the door, and in front of it a table
with cups and a flagon of ale. Here and
there are stools.</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em;"><i>At the Abbey Theatre the house is
orange red and the chairs and tables and
flagons black, with a slight purple tinge
which is not clearly distinguishable from
the black. The rocks are black with a
few green touches. The sea is green and
luminous, and all the characters except</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
<i>the <span class="sc">Red Man</span> and the Black Men are
dressed in various shades of green, one
or two with touches of purple which look
nearly black. The Black Men all wear
dark purple and have eared caps, and at
the end their eyes should look green from
the reflected light of the sea. The <span class="sc">Red
Man</span> is altogether in red. He is very tall,
and his height increased by horns on the
Green Helmet. The effect is intentionally
violent and startling.</i></p>

<div class="play">

<p>I killed them all before daybreak&mdash;I hoked them out of their lair;</p>

<p>That though she may be his wife, she has no right to go</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 3em;">Not even a fish or a gull.</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

<p>You were gone but a little while. We were there and the ale-cup full.</p>
<p>We were half drunk and merry, and midnight on the stroke</p>
<p>When a wide, high man came in with a red foxy cloak,</p>
<p>With half-shut foxy eyes and a great laughing mouth,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>54</span></p>
<p>And he said when we bid him drink, that he had so great a drouth</p>
<p>He could drink the sea.</p>

<p class="person">Cuchulain</p>

  <p style="padding-left: 2em;">I thought he had come from one of you</p>
<p>Out of some Connaught rath, and would lap up milk and mew;</p>
<p>But if he so loved water I have the tale awry.</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

<p>You would not be so merry if he were standing by,</p>
<p>For when we had sung or danced as he were our next of kin</p>
<p>He promised to show us a game, the best that ever had been;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>55</span></p>
<p>And when we had asked what game, he answered, &ldquo;Why, whip off my head!</p>
<p>Then one of you two stoop down, and I&rsquo;ll whip off his,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A head for a head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is the game that I play.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="person">Cuchulain</p>

<p>How could he whip off a head when his own had been whipped away?</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

<p>We told him it over and over, and that ale had fuddled his wit,</p>
<p>But he stood and laughed at us there, as though his sides would split,</p>
<p>Till I could stand it no longer, and whipped off his head at a blow,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>56</span></p>
<p>Being mad that he did not answer, and more at his laughing so,</p>
<p>And there on the ground where it fell it went on laughing at me.</p>

<p class="person">Laegaire</p>

<p>Till he took it up in his hands&mdash;</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

      <p style="padding-left: 3em;">And splashed himself into the sea.</p>

<p class="person">Cuchulain</p>

<p>You never did.</p>

<p>I did not take it to keep it&mdash;the Red Man gave it for one,</p>
<p>But I shall give it to all&mdash;to all of us three or to none;</p>
<p>That is as you look upon it&mdash;we will pass it to and fro,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>67</span></p>
<p>Stroke into peace this cat that has come to take our lives.</p>
<p>Now it is purring again, and now I drink to your wives,</p>
<p>And I drink to Emer, my wife.</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>A great noise without and shouting</i>]</p>

<p>Why, what in God&rsquo;s name is that noise?</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

<p>What else but the charioteers and the kitchen and stable boys</p>
<p>Shouting against each other, and the worst of all is your own,</p>
<p>That chariot-driver, Laeg, and they&rsquo;ll keep it up till the dawn,</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a man in the house that will close his eyes to-night,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>68</span></p>
<p>Or be able to keep them from it, or know what set them to fight.</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>A noise of horns without</i>]</p>

<p>There, do you hear them now? such hatred has each for each</p>
<p>They have taken the hunting horns to drown one other&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>For fear the truth may prevail.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s your good health and long life,</p>
<p>And, though she be quarrelsome, good health to Emer, your wife.</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>The Charioteers, Stable Boys and

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

<p>I am Laeg, Cuchulain&rsquo;s driver, and my master&rsquo;s cock of the yard.</p>

<p>Conall would scatter his feathers.</p>

       <p style="padding-left: 3em;">No use, they won&rsquo;t hear a word.</p>

<p class="person">Conall</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll keep it up till the dawn.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 3em;">It is Laegaire that is the best,</p>
<p>For he fought with cats in Connaught while Conall took his rest</p>
<p>And drained his ale pot.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

  <p style="padding-left: 2em;">Laegaire&mdash;what does a man of his sort</p>
<p>Care for the like of us! He did it for his own sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>70</span></p>
<p class="person">Another</p>

<p>It was all mere luck at the best.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

                  <p style="padding-left: 4em;">But Conall, I say&mdash;</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

                         <p style="padding-left: 6em;">Let me speak.</p>

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d be dumb if the cock of the yard would but open his beak.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

<p>Before your cock was born, my master was in the fight.</p>

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

<p>Go home and praise your grand-dad. They took to the horns for spite,</p>
<p>For I said that no cock of your sort had been born since the fight began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>71</span></p>
<p class="person">Another</p>

<p>Conall has got it, the best man has got it, and I am his man.</p>

<p class="person">Cuchulain</p>

<p>Who was it started this quarrel?</p>

<p class="person">A Stable Boy</p>

                     <p style="padding-left: 6em;">It was Laeg.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 4em;">It was Laeg done it all.</p>

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

<p>A high, wide, foxy man came where we sat in the hall,</p>
<p>Getting our supper ready, with a great voice like the wind,</p>
<p>And cried that there was a helmet, or something of the kind,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>72</span></p>
<p>That was for the foremost man upon the ridge of the earth.</p>
<p>So I cried your name through the hall,</p>

<p class="dir">[<i>The others cry out and blow horns,
partly drowning the rest of his
speech</i>]</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 4em;">but they denied its worth,</p>
<p>Preferring Laegaire or Conall, and they cried to drown my voice;</p>
<p>But I have so strong a throat that I drowned all their noise</p>
<p>Till they took to the hunting horns and blew them into my face,</p>
<p>And as neither side would give in&mdash;we would settle it in this place.</p>
<p>Let the Helmet be taken from Conall.</p>

<p class="person">A Stable Boy</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 3em;">No, Conall is the best man here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>73</span></p>
<p class="person">Another</p>

<p>Give it to Laegaire that made the murderous cats pay dear.</p>

<p class="person">Cuchulain</p>

<p>It has been given to none: that our rivalry might cease,</p>
<p>We have turned that murderous cat into a cup of peace.</p>
<p>I drank the first; and then Conall; give it to Laegaire now,</p>

<p class="dir">[<i><span class="sc">Conall</span> gives Helmet to <span class="sc">Laegaire</span></i>]</p>

<p>That it may purr in his hand and all of our servants know</p>

<p class="person">A Servant</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s well&mdash;I will stop my shouting.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

               <p style="padding-left: 4em;">Cuchulain is in the right;</p>
<p>I am tired of this big horn that has made me hoarse as a rook.</p>

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

<p>Cuchulain, you drank the first.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

           <p style="padding-left: 4em;">By drinking the first he took</p>
<p>The whole of the honours himself.</p>

<p class="person">Laeg</p>

       <p style="padding-left: 3em;">Cuchulain, you drank the first.</p>

<p class="person">Another</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
