<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>MASHI</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="small-caps">Mashi!</span>&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&lsquo;Try to sleep, Jotin, it is getting late.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind if it is. I have not many days
left. I was thinking that Mani should go to her
father's house.&mdash;I forget where he is now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sitarampur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! Sitarampur. Send her there. She
should not remain any longer near a sick man.
She herself is not strong.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just listen to him! How can she bear to
leave you in this state?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does she know what the doctors<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But she can see for herself! The other day
she cried her eyes out at the merest hint of having
to go to her father's house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We must explain that in this statement there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
was a slight distortion of truth, to say the least of
it. The actual talk with Mani was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose, my child, you have got some news
from your father? I thought I saw your cousin
Anath here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes! Next Friday will be my little sister's
<i>annaprashan</i><a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ceremony. So I'm thinking<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, my dear. Send her a gold necklace.
It will please your mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm thinking of going myself. I've never
seen my little sister, and I want to ever so
much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever do you mean? You surely don't
think of leaving Jotin alone? Haven't you heard
what the doctor says about him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he said that just now there's no special
cause for<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even if he did, you can see his state.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is the first girl after three brothers, and
she's a great favourite.&mdash;I have heard that it's going
to be a grand affair. If I don't go, mother will
be very<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes! I don't understand your mother.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
But I know very well that your father will be
angry enough if you leave Jotin just now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You'll have to write a line to him saying that
there is no special cause for anxiety, and that even
if I go, there will be no<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You're right there; it will certainly be no
great loss if you do go. But remember, if I write
to your father, I'll tell him plainly what is in my
mind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you needn't write. I shall ask my
husband, and he will surely<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here, child, I've borne a good deal from
you, but if you do that, I won't stand it for a
moment. Your father knows you too well for
you to deceive him.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>When Mashi had left her, Mani lay down on
her bed in a bad temper.</p>

<p>Her neighbour and friend came and asked
what was the matter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here! What a shame it is! Here's
my only sister's <i>annaprashan</i> coming, and they
don't want to let me go to it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why! Surely you're never thinking of going,
are you, with your husband so ill?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don't do anything for him, and I couldn't if
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
I tried. It's so deadly dull in this house, that I
tell you frankly I can't bear it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are a strange woman!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I can't pretend, as you people do, and
look glum lest any one should think ill of me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, tell me your plan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must go. Nobody can prevent me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Isss! What an imperious young woman you
are!&rsquo;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Hearing that Mani had wept at the mere
thought of going to her father's house, Jotin was
so excited that he sat up in bed. Pulling his
pillow towards him, he leaned back, and said:
&lsquo;Mashi, open this window a little, and take that
lamp away.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>The still night stood silently at the window like
a pilgrim of eternity; and the stars gazed in,
witnesses through untold ages of countless death-scenes.</p>

<p>Jotin saw his Mani's face traced on the background
of the dark night, and saw those two big
dark eyes brimming over with tears, as it were for
all eternity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>Mashi felt relieved when she saw him so quiet,
thinking he was asleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started up, and said: &lsquo;Mashi,
you all thought that Mani was too frivolous
ever to be happy in our house. But you see
now<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I see now, my Baba,<a name="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I was mistaken&mdash;but
trial tests a person.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do try to sleep, dear!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me think a little, let me talk. Don't be
vexed, Mashi!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Once, when I used to think I could not win
Mani's heart, I bore it silently. But you<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, dear, I won't allow you to say that; I
also bore it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Our minds, you know, are not clods of earth
which you can possess by merely picking up. I
felt that Mani did not know her own mind, and
that one day at some great shock<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jotin, you are right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Therefore I never took much notice of her
waywardness.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>Mashi remained silent, suppressing a sigh. Not
once, but often she had seen Jotin spending the
night on the verandah wet with the splashing rain,
yet not caring to go into his bedroom. Many a
day he lay with a throbbing head, longing, she
knew, that Mani would come and soothe his brow,
while Mani was getting ready to go to the theatre.
Yet when Mashi went to fan him, he sent her away
petulantly. She alone knew what pain lay hidden
in that distress. Again and again she had wanted
to say to Jotin: &lsquo;Don't pay so much attention to
that silly child, my dear; let her learn to want,&mdash;to
cry for things.&rsquo; But these things cannot
be said, and are apt to be misunderstood. Jotin
had in his heart a shrine set up to the goddess
Woman, and there Mani had her throne. It was
hard for him to imagine that his own fate was to
be denied his share of the wine of love poured out
by that divinity. Therefore the worship went on,
the sacrifice was offered, and the hope of a boon
never ceased.</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Mashi imagined once more that Jotin was
sleeping, when he cried out suddenly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know you thought that I was not happy
with Mani, and therefore you were angry with her.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
But, Mashi, happiness is like those stars. They
don't cover all the darkness; there are gaps between.
We make mistakes in life and we misunderstand,
and yet there remain gaps through which truth
shines. I do not know whence comes this gladness
that fills my heart to-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mashi began gently to soothe Jotin's brow, her
tears unseen in the dark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was thinking, Mashi, she's so young! What
will she do when I am<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Young, Jotin? She's old enough. I too was
young when I lost the idol of my life, only to find
him in my heart for ever. Was that any loss,
do you think? Besides, is happiness absolutely
necessary?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, it seems as if just when Mani's heart
shows signs of awakening I have to<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don't you worry about that, Jotin. Isn't it
enough if her heart awakes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Jotin recollected the words of a village
minstrel's song which he had heard long before:</p>

<div class="poetry italic width34">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">O my heart! you woke not when the man of my heart came to my door.<br/></div>
<div class="line">At the sound of his departing steps you woke up.<br/></div>
<div class="line">Oh, you woke up in the dark!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>&lsquo;Mashi, what is the time now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;About nine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So early as that! Why, I thought it must be
at least two or three o'clock. My midnight, you
know, begins at sundown. But why did you want
me to sleep, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, you know how late last night you kept
awake talking; so to-day you must get to sleep
early.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is Mani asleep?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no, she's busy making some soup for
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You don't mean to say so, Mashi? Does
she<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly! Why, she prepares all your food,
the busy little woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought perhaps Mani could not<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It doesn't take long for a woman to learn
such things. With the need it comes of itself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The fish soup, that I had in the morning,
had such a delicate flavour, I thought you had
made it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear me, no! Surely you don't think Mani
would let me do anything for you? Why, she
does all your washing herself. She knows you
can't bear anything dirty about you. If only you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
could see your sitting-room, how spick and span
she keeps it! If I were to let her haunt your
sick-room, she would wear herself out. But that's
what she really wants to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is Mani's health, then<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The doctors think she should not be allowed
to visit the sick-room too often. She's too tender-hearted.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, Mashi, how do you prevent her from
coming?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because she obeys me implicitly. But still I
have constantly to be giving her news of you.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>The stars glistened in the sky like tear-drops.
Jotin bowed his head in gratitude to his life that
was about to depart, and when Death stretched out
his right hand towards him through the darkness,
he took it in perfect trust.</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Jotin sighed, and, with a slight gesture of impatience,
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, if Mani is still awake, then, could I&mdash;if
only for a<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well! I'll go and call her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I won't keep her long, only for five minutes.
I have something particular to tell her.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>Mashi, sighing, went out to call Mani. Meanwhile
Jotin's pulse began to beat fast. He knew
too well that he had never been able to have an
intimate talk with Mani. The two instruments
were tuned differently and it was not easy to
play them in unison. Again and again, Jotin had
felt pangs of jealousy on hearing Mani chattering
and laughing merrily with her girl companions.
Jotin blamed only himself,&mdash;why couldn't he talk
irrelevant trifles as they did? Not that he could
not, for with his men friends he often chatted
on all sorts of trivialities. But the small talk that
suits men is not suitable for women. You can
hold a philosophical discourse in monologue,
ignoring your inattentive audience altogether, but
small talk requires the co-operation of at least
two. The bagpipes can be played singly, but
there must be a pair of cymbals. How often in
the evenings had Jotin, when sitting on the open
verandah with Mani, made some strained attempts
at conversation, only to feel the thread snap. And
the very silence of the evening felt ashamed. Jotin
was certain that Mani longed to get away. He
had even wished earnestly that a third person
would come. For talking is easy with three,
when it is hard for two.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>He began to think what he should say when
Mani came. But such manufactured talk would
not satisfy him. Jotin felt afraid that this five
minutes of to-night would be wasted. Yet, for
him, there were but few moments left for intimate
talk.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>&lsquo;What's this, child, you're not going anywhere,
are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course, I'm going to Sitarampur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean? Who is going to take
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Anath.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not to-day, my child, some other day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But the compartment has already been reserved.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does that matter? That loss can easily
be borne. Go to-morrow, early in the morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, I don't hold by your inauspicious
days. What harm if I do go to-day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jotin wants to have a talk with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right! there's still some time. I'll just
go and see him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you mustn't say that you are going.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, I won't tell him, but I shan't be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
able to stay long. To-morrow is my sister's
<i>annaprashan</i>, and I must go to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my child! I beg you to listen to
me this once. Quiet your mind for a while
and sit by him. Don't let him see your
hurry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What can I do? The train won't wait for
me. Anath will be back in ten minutes. I can
sit by him till then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, that won't do. I shall never let you go
to him in that frame of mind.&hellip; Oh, you
wretch! the man you are torturing is soon to leave
this world; but I warn you, you will remember
this day till the end of your days! That there is
a God! that there is a God! you will some day
understand!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, you mustn't curse me like that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my darling boy! my darling! why do
you go on living longer? There is no end to
this sin, yet I cannot check it!&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Mashi after delaying a little returned to the
sick-room, hoping by that time Jotin would be
asleep. But Jotin moved in his bed when she
entered. Mashi exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just look what she has done!&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>&lsquo;What's happened? Hasn't Mani come?
Why have you been so long, Mashi?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I found her weeping bitterly because she had
allowed the milk for your soup to get burnt! I
tried to console her, saying, &ldquo;Why, there's more
milk to be had!&rdquo; But that she could be so careless
about the preparation of <em>your</em> soup made her wild.
With great trouble I managed to pacify her and
put her to bed. So I haven't brought her to-day.
Let her sleep it off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Though Jotin was pained when Mani didn't
come, yet he felt a certain amount of relief. He
had half feared that Mani's bodily presence would
do violence to his heart's image of her. Such
things had happened before in his life. And the
gladness of the idea that Mani was miserable at
burning <em>his</em> milk filled his heart to overflowing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it, Baba?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I feel quite certain that my days are drawing
to a close. But I have no regrets. Don't grieve
for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, dear, I won't grieve. I don't believe that
only life is good and not death.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, I tell you truly that death seems
sweet.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>Jotin, gazing at the dark sky, felt that it was
Mani herself who was coming to him in Death's
guise. She had immortal youth and the stars were
flowers of blessing, showered upon her dark tresses
by the hand of the World-Mother. It seemed as
if once more he had his first sight of his bride
under the veil of darkness.<a name="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The immense night
became filled with the loving gaze of Mani's dark
eyes. Mani, the bride of this house, the little
girl, became transformed into a world-image,&mdash;her
throne on the altar of the stars at the confluence of
life and death. Jotin said to himself with clasped
hands: &lsquo;At last the veil is raised, the covering is
rent in this deep darkness. Ah, beautiful one!
how often have you wrung my heart, but no
longer shall you forsake me!&rsquo;</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>&lsquo;I'm suffering, Mashi, but nothing like you
imagine. It seems to me as if my pain were
gradually separating itself from my life. Like a
laden boat, it was so long being towed behind, but
the rope has snapped, and now it floats away with
all my burdens. Still I can see it, but it is no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
longer mine.&hellip; But, Mashi, I've not seen Mani
even once for the last two days!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jotin, let me give you another pillow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It almost seems to me, Mashi, that Mani also
has left me like that laden boat of sorrow which
drifts away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just sip some pomegranate juice, dear! Your
throat must be getting dry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wrote my will yesterday; did I show it to
you? I can't recollect.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There's no need to show it to me, Jotin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When mother died, I had nothing of my own.
You fed me and brought me up. Therefore I
was saying<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, child! I had only this house and
a little property. You earned the rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But this house<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That's nothing. Why, you've added to it so
much that it's difficult to find out where my house
was!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm sure Mani's love for you is really<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes! I know that, Jotin. Now you try
to sleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Though I have bequeathed all my property
to Mani, it is practically yours, Mashi. She will
never disobey you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>&lsquo;Why are you worrying so much about that,
dear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All I have I owe to you. When you see my
will don't think for a moment that<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, Jotin? Do you think
I shall mind for a moment because you give to
Mani what belongs to you? Surely I'm not so
mean as that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you also will have<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here, Jotin, I shall get angry with you.
You want to console me with money!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mashi, how I wish I could give you
something better than money!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That you have done, Jotin!&mdash;more than
enough. Haven't I had you to fill my lonely
house? I must have won that great good-fortune
in many previous births! You have given me so
much that now, if my destiny's due is exhausted,
I shall not complain. Yes, yes! Give away everything
in Mani's name,&mdash;your house, your money,
your carriage, and your land&mdash;such burdens are
too heavy for me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course I know you have lost your taste for
the enjoyments of life, but Mani is so young
that<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No! you mustn't say that. If you want to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
leave her your property, it is all right, but as for
enjoyment<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What harm if she does enjoy herself, Mashi?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no, it will be impossible. Her throat
will become parched, and it will be dust and ashes
to her.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Jotin remained silent. He could not decide
whether it was true or not, and whether it was a
matter of regret or otherwise, that the world
would become distasteful to Mani for want of him.
The stars seemed to whisper in his heart:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed it is true. We have been watching
for thousands of years, and know that all
these great preparations for enjoyment are but
vanity.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Jotin sighed and said: &lsquo;We cannot leave behind
us what is really worth giving.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's no trifle you are giving, dearest. I only
pray she may have the power to know the value
of what is given her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give me a little more of that pomegranate juice,
Mashi, I'm thirsty. Did Mani come to me yesterday,
I wonder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, she came, but you were asleep. She sat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
by your head, fanning you for a long time, and
then went away to get your clothes washed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How wonderful! I believe I was dreaming
that very moment that Mani was trying to enter
my room. The door was slightly open, and she
was pushing against it, but it wouldn't open.
But, Mashi, you're going too far,&mdash;you ought to
let her see that I am dying; otherwise my death
will be a terrible shock to her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Baba, let me put this shawl over your feet;
they are getting cold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Mashi, I can't bear anything over me
like that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you know, Jotin, Mani made this shawl
for you? When she ought to have been asleep,
she was busy at it. It was finished only yesterday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jotin took the shawl, and touched it tenderly
with his hands. It seemed to him that the softness
of the wool was Mani's own. Her loving
thoughts had been woven night after night with
its threads. It was not made merely of wool, but
also of her touch. Therefore, when Mashi drew
that shawl over his feet, it seemed as if, night after
night, Mani had been caressing his tired limbs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, Mashi, I thought Mani didn't know
how to knit,&mdash;at any rate she never liked it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>&lsquo;It doesn't take long to learn a thing. Of
course I had to teach her. Then there are a good
many mistakes in it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let there be mistakes; we're not going to
send it to the Paris Exhibition. It will keep my
feet warm in spite of its mistakes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jotin's mind began to picture Mani at her task,
blundering and struggling, and yet patiently going
on night after night. How sweetly pathetic it
was! And again he went over the shawl with his
caressing fingers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, is the doctor downstairs?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, he will stay here to-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But tell him it is useless for him to give me a
sleeping draught. It doesn't bring me real rest and
only adds to my pain. Let me remain properly
awake. Do you know, Mashi, that my wedding
took place on the night of the full moon in the
month of <i>Baisakh</i>? To-morrow will be that day,
and the stars of that very night will be shining in
the sky. Mani perhaps has forgotten. I want to
remind her of it to-day; just call her to me for a
minute or two.&hellip; Why do you keep silent?
I suppose the doctor has told you I am so weak
that any excitement will<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but I tell you truly,
Mashi, to-night, if I can have only a few minutes'
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
talk with her, there will be no need for any
sleeping draughts. Mashi, don't cry like that!
I am quite well. To-day my heart is full as it has
never been in my life before. That's why I want
to see Mani. No, no, Mashi, I can't bear to
see you crying! You have been so quiet all these
last days. Why are you so troubled to-night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Jotin, I thought that I had exhausted all
my tears, but I find there are plenty left. I can't
bear it any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Call Mani. I'll remind her of our wedding
night, so that to-morrow she may<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm going, dear. Shombhu will wait at the
door. If you want anything, call him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mashi went to Mani's bedroom and sat down
on the floor crying,&mdash;&lsquo;Oh come, come once, you
heartless wretch! Keep his last request who has
given you his all! Don't kill him who is already
dying!&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Jotin hearing the sound of footsteps started up,
saying, &lsquo;Mani!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am Shombhu. Did you call me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ask your mistress to come?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ask whom?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your mistress.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>&lsquo;She has not yet returned.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Returned? From where?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;From Sitarampur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When did she go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Three days ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Jotin felt numb all over, and his
head began to swim. He slipped down from the
pillows, on which he was reclining, and kicked off
the woollen shawl that was over his feet.</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>When Mashi came back after a long time,
Jotin did not mention Mani's name, and Mashi
thought he had forgotten all about her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jotin cried out: &lsquo;Mashi, did I tell
you about the dream I had the other night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Which dream?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That in which Mani was pushing the door,
and the door wouldn't open more than an inch.
She stood outside unable to enter. Now I know
that Mani has to stand outside my door till the last.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="space-break"/>

<p>Mashi kept silent. She realised that the heaven
she had been building for Jotin out of falsehood
had toppled down at last. If sorrow comes, it
is best to acknowledge it.&mdash;When God strikes, we
cannot avoid the blow.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>&lsquo;Mashi, the love I have got from you will last
through all my births. I have filled this life with
it to carry it with me. In the next birth, I am
sure you will be born as my daughter, and I shall
tend you with all my love.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are you saying, Jotin? Do you mean
to say I shall be born again as a woman? Why
can't you pray that I should come to your arms
as a son?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no, not a son! You will come to my
house in that wonderful beauty which you had
when you were young. I can even imagine how
I shall dress you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don't talk so much, Jotin, but try to sleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall name you &ldquo;Lakshmi.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But that is an old-fashioned name, Jotin!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, but you are my old-fashioned Mashi.
Come to my house again with those beautiful old-fashioned
manners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can't wish that I should come and burden
your home with the misfortune of a girl-child!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, you think me weak, and are wanting
to save me all trouble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My child, I am a woman, so I have my weakness.
Therefore I have tried all my life to save
you from all sorts of trouble,&mdash;only to fail.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>&lsquo;Mashi, I have not had time in this life to
apply the lessons I have learnt. But they will
keep for my next birth. I shall show then what
a man is able to do. I have learnt how false it is
always to be looking after oneself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever you may say, darling, you have
never grasped anything for yourself, but given
everything to others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, I can boast of one thing at any rate.
I have never been a tyrant in my happiness, or
tried to enforce my claims by violence. Because
lies could not content me, I have had to wait long.
Perhaps truth will be kind to me at last.&mdash;Who
is that, Mashi, who is that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where? There's no one there, Jotin!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mashi, just go and see in the other room. I
thought I<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, dear! I don't see anybody.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it seemed quite clear to me that<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Jotin, it's nothing. So keep quiet! The
doctor is coming now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the doctor entered, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here, you mustn't stay near the patient
so much, you excite him. You go to bed, and
my assistant will remain with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Mashi, I can't let you go.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>&lsquo;All right, Baba! I will sit quietly in that corner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no! you must sit by my side. I can't
let go your hand, not till the very end. I have
been made by your hand, and only from your
hand shall God take me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;you can remain
there. But, Jotin Babu, you must not talk to
her. It's time for you to take your medicine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Time for my medicine? Nonsense! The
time for that is over. To give medicine now is
merely to deceive; besides I am not afraid to die.
Mashi, Death is busy with his physic; why do
you add another nuisance in the shape of a doctor?
Send him away, send him away! It is you alone
I need now! No one else, none whatever! No
more falsehood!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I protest, as a doctor, this excitement is doing
you harm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then go, doctor, don't excite me any more!&mdash;Mashi,
has he gone?&hellip; That's good!
Now come and take my head in your lap.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, dear! Now, Baba, try to sleep!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Mashi, don't ask me to sleep. If I
sleep, I shall never wake. I still need to keep
awake a little longer. Don't you hear a sound?
Somebody is coming.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27&ndash;28"> </a>V</h3>

<p>&lsquo;Jotin dear, just open your eyes a little. She
has come. Look once and see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who has come? A dream?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a dream, darling! Mani has come with
her father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can't you see? This is your Mani!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mani? Has that door opened?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Baba, it is wide open.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Mashi, not that shawl! not <em>that</em> shawl!
That shawl is a fraud!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not a shawl, Jotin! It is our Mani,
who has flung herself on your feet. Put your
hand on her head and bless her. Don't cry like
that, Mani! There will be time enough for that.
Keep quiet now for a little.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29&ndash;30"> </a>THE SKELETON</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>THE SKELETON</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">In</span> the room next to the one in which we boys
used to sleep, there hung a human skeleton. In
the night it would rattle in the breeze which
played about its bones. In the day these bones
were rattled by us. We were taking lessons in
osteology from a student in the Campbell Medical
School, for our guardians were determined to make
us masters of all the sciences. How far they
succeeded we need not tell those who know us;
and it is better hidden from those who do not.</p>

<p>Many years have passed since then. In the
meantime the skeleton has vanished from the
room, and the science of osteology from our brains,
leaving no trace behind.</p>

<p>The other day, our house was crowded with
guests, and I had to pass the night in the same
old room. In these now unfamiliar surroundings,
sleep refused to come, and, as I tossed from side to
side, I heard all the hours of the night chimed, one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
after another, by the church clock near by. At
length the lamp in the corner of the room, after
some minutes of choking and spluttering, went
out altogether. One or two bereavements had
recently happened in the family, so the going
out of the lamp naturally led me to thoughts of
death. In the great arena of nature, I thought,
the light of a lamp losing itself in eternal darkness,
and the going out of the light of our little
human lives, by day or by night, were much the
same thing.</p>

<p>My train of thought recalled to my mind the
skeleton. While I was trying to imagine what
the body which had clothed it could have been
like, it suddenly seemed to me that something was
walking round and round my bed, groping along
the walls of the room. I could hear its rapid
breathing. It seemed as if it was searching for
something which it could not find, and pacing
round the room with ever-hastier steps. I felt
quite sure that this was a mere fancy of my sleepless,
excited brain; and that the throbbing of the
veins in my temples was really the sound which
seemed like running footsteps. Nevertheless, a
cold shiver ran all over me. To help to get rid
of this hallucination, I called out aloud: &lsquo;Who is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
there?&rsquo; The footsteps seemed to stop at my bedside,
and the reply came: &lsquo;It is I. I have come to
look for that skeleton of mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed absurd to show any fear before the
creature of my own imagination; so, clutching
my pillow a little more tightly, I said in a casual
sort of way: &lsquo;A nice business for this time of
night! Of what use will that skeleton be to you
now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The reply seemed to come almost from my
mosquito-curtain itself. &lsquo;What a question! In
that skeleton were the bones that encircled my
heart; the youthful charm of my six-and-twenty
years bloomed about it. Should I not desire to
see it once more?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a perfectly reasonable
desire. Well, go on with your search, while I try
to get a little sleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Said the voice: &lsquo;But I fancy you are lonely.
All right; I'll sit down a while, and we will have
a little chat. Years ago I used to sit by men and
talk to them. But during the last thirty-five years
I have only moaned in the wind in the burning-places
of the dead. I would talk once more with
a man as in the old times.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I felt that some one sat down just near my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
curtain. Resigning myself to the situation, I replied
with as much cordiality as I could summon:
&lsquo;That will be very nice indeed. Let us talk of
something cheerful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The funniest thing I can think of is my own
life-story. Let me tell you that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The church clock chimed the hour of two.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I was in the land of the living, and
young, I feared one thing like death itself, and
that was my husband. My feelings can be likened
only to those of a fish caught with a hook. For
it was as if a stranger had snatched me away with
the sharpest of hooks from the peaceful calm of
my childhood's home&mdash;and from him I had no
means of escape. My husband died two months
after my marriage, and my friends and relations
moaned pathetically on my behalf. My husband's
father, after scrutinising my face with great care,
said to my mother-in-law: &ldquo;Do you not see, she
has the evil eye?&rdquo;&mdash;Well, are you listening? I
hope you are enjoying the story?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very much indeed!&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;The beginning
is extremely humorous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me proceed then. I came back to my
father's house in great glee. People tried to
conceal it from me, but I knew well that I was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
endowed with a rare and radiant beauty. What
is your opinion?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; I murmured. &lsquo;But you must
remember that I never saw you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What! Not seen me? What about that
skeleton of mine? Ha! ha! ha! Never mind.
I was only joking. How can I ever make you
believe that those two cavernous hollows contained
the brightest of dark, languishing eyes? And
that the smile which was revealed by those ruby
lips had no resemblance whatever to the grinning
teeth which you used to see? The mere attempt
to convey to you some idea of the grace, the
charm, the soft, firm, dimpled curves, which in the
fulness of youth were growing and blossoming
over those dry old bones makes me smile; it also
makes me angry. The most eminent doctors of
my time could not have dreamed of the bones
of that body of mine as materials for teaching
osteology. Do you know, one young doctor that
I knew of, actually compared me to a golden
<i>champak</i> blossom. It meant that to him the
rest of humankind was fit only to illustrate the
science of physiology, that I was a flower of beauty.
Does any one think of the skeleton of a <i>champak</i>
flower?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>&lsquo;When I walked, I felt that, like a diamond
scattering splendour, my every movement set
waves of beauty radiating on every side. I used
to spend hours gazing on my hands&mdash;hands which
could gracefully have reined the liveliest of male
creatures.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But that stark and staring old skeleton of
mine has borne false-witness to you against me,
while I was unable to refute the shameless libel.
That is why of all men I hate you most! I feel
I would like once for all to banish sleep from your
eyes with a vision of that warm rosy loveliness
of mine, to sweep out with it all the wretched
osteological stuff of which your brain is full.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I could have sworn by your body,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;if
you had it still, that no vestige of osteology has
remained in my head, and that the only thing that
it is now full of is a radiant vision of perfect
loveliness, glowing against the black background
of night. I cannot say more than that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I had no girl-companions,&rsquo; went on the voice.
&lsquo;My only brother had made up his mind not to
marry. In the zenana I was alone. Alone I
used to sit in the garden under the shade of the
trees, and dream that the whole world was in love
with me; that the stars with sleepless gaze were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
drinking in my beauty; that the wind was
languishing in sighs as on some pretext or other it
brushed past me; and that the lawn on which my
feet rested, had it been conscious, would have lost
consciousness again at their touch. It seemed to
me that all the young men in the world were as
blades of grass at my feet; and my heart, I know
not why, used to grow sad.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When my brother's friend, Shekhar, had passed
out of the Medical College, he became our family
doctor. I had already often seen him from
behind a curtain. My brother was a strange man,
and did not care to look on the world with open
eyes. It was not empty enough for his taste; so
he gradually moved away from it, until he was
quite lost in an obscure corner. Shekhar was his
one friend, so he was the only young man I could
ever get to see. And when I held my evening
court in my garden, then the host of imaginary
young men whom I had at my feet were each one
a Shekhar.&mdash;Are you listening? What are you
thinking of?&rsquo;</p>

<p>I sighed as I replied: &lsquo;I was wishing I was
Shekhar!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a bit. Hear the whole story first. One
day, in the rains, I was feverish. The doctor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
came to see me. That was our first meeting. I
was reclining opposite the window, so that the
blush of the evening sky might temper the pallor
of my complexion. When the doctor, coming in,
looked up into my face, I put myself into his place,
and gazed at myself in imagination. I saw in the
glorious evening light that delicate wan face laid
like a drooping flower against the soft white pillow,
with the unrestrained curls playing over the forehead,
and the bashfully lowered eyelids casting a
pathetic shade over the whole countenance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The doctor, in a tone bashfully low, asked
my brother: &ldquo;Might I feel her pulse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I put out a tired, well-rounded wrist from
beneath the coverlet. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought I, as I looked
on it, &ldquo;if only there had been a sapphire bracelet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
I have never before seen a doctor so awkward
about feeling a patient's pulse. His fingers
trembled as they felt my wrist. He measured the
heat of my fever, I gauged the pulse of his heart.&mdash;Don't
you believe me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very easily,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;the human heart-beat
tells its tale.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;After I had been taken ill and restored to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
health several times, I found that the number of
the courtiers who attended my imaginary evening
reception began to dwindle till they were reduced
to only one! And at last in my little world there
remained only one doctor and one patient.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In these evenings I used to dress myself<a name="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
secretly in a canary-coloured <i>sari</i>; twine about the
braided knot into which I did my hair a garland
of white jasmine blossoms; and with a little
mirror in my hand betake myself to my usual seat
under the trees.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well! Are you perhaps thinking that the
sight of one's own beauty would soon grow
wearisome? Ah no! for I did not see myself
with my own eyes. I was then one and also two.
I used to see myself as though I were the doctor;
I gazed, I was charmed, I fell madly in love.
But, in spite of all the caresses I lavished on myself,
a sigh would wander about my heart, moaning
like the evening breeze.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Anyhow, from that time I was never alone.
When I walked I watched with downcast eyes the
play of my dainty little toes on the earth, and
wondered what the doctor would have felt had he
been there to see. At mid-day the sky would be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
filled with the glare of the sun, without a sound,
save now and then the distant cry of a passing kite.
Outside our garden-walls the hawker would pass
with his musical cry of &ldquo;Bangles for sale, crystal
bangles.&rdquo; And I, spreading a snow-white sheet on
the lawn, would lie on it with my head on my arm.
With studied carelessness the other arm would rest
lightly on the soft sheet, and I would imagine to
myself that some one had caught sight of the
wonderful pose of my hand, that some one had
clasped it in both of his and imprinted a kiss on its
rosy palm, and was slowly walking away.&mdash;What
if I ended the story here? How would it do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not half a bad ending,&rsquo; I replied thoughtfully.
&lsquo;It would no doubt remain a little incomplete, but
I could easily spend the rest of the night putting
in the finishing touches.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But that would make the story too serious.
Where would the laugh come in? Where would
be the skeleton with its grinning teeth?</p>

<p>&lsquo;So let me go on. As soon as the doctor had
got a little practice, he took a room on the ground-floor
of our house for a consulting-chamber. I
used then sometimes to ask him jokingly about
medicines and poisons, and how much of this
drug or that would kill a man. The subject was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
congenial and he would wax eloquent. These
talks familiarised me with the idea of death; and
so love and death were the only two things that
filled my little world. My story is now nearly
ended&mdash;there is not much left.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not much of the night is left either,&rsquo; I
muttered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After a time I noticed that the doctor had
grown strangely absent-minded, and it seemed as
if he were ashamed of something which he was
trying to keep from me. One day he came in,
somewhat smartly dressed, and borrowed my
brother's carriage for the evening.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My curiosity became too much for me, and I
went up to my brother for information. After
some talk beside the point, I at last asked him:
&ldquo;By the way, Dada,<a name="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where is the doctor going
this evening in your carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My brother briefly replied: &ldquo;To his death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, do tell me,&rdquo; I importuned. &ldquo;Where is
he really going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To be married,&rdquo; he said, a little more
explicitly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said I, as I laughed long and
loudly.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>&lsquo;I gradually learnt that the bride was an heiress,
who would bring the doctor a large sum of money.
But why did he insult me by hiding all this from
me? Had I ever begged and prayed him not to
marry, because it would break my heart? Men
are not to be trusted. I have known only one
man in all my life, and in a moment I made this
discovery.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When the doctor came in after his work and
was ready to start, I said to him, rippling with
laughter the while: &ldquo;Well, doctor, so you are to
be married to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My gaiety not only made the doctor lose
countenance; it thoroughly irritated him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that there is no
illumination, no band of music?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;With a sigh he replied: &ldquo;Is marriage then
such a joyful occasion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I burst out into renewed laughter. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;this will never do. Who ever heard of a
wedding without lights and music?&rdquo;</p>

<p><ins title="I">&lsquo;I</ins> bothered my brother about it so much that
he at once ordered all the trappings of a gay
wedding.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All the time I kept on gaily talking of the
bride, of what would happen, of what I would do
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
when the bride came home. &ldquo;And, doctor,&rdquo; I
asked, &ldquo;will you still go on feeling pulses?&rdquo;
Ha! ha! ha! Though the inner workings of
people's, especially men's, minds are not visible,
still I can take my oath that these words were
piercing the doctor's bosom like deadly darts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The marriage was to be celebrated late at night.
Before starting, the doctor and my brother were
having a glass of wine together on the terrace, as
was their daily habit. The moon had just risen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I went up smiling, and said: &ldquo;Have you
forgotten your wedding, doctor? It is time to
start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must here tell you one little thing. I had
meanwhile gone down to the dispensary and got a
little powder, which at a convenient opportunity
I had dropped unobserved into the doctor's glass.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The doctor, draining his glass at a gulp, in a
voice thick with emotion, and with a look that
pierced me to the heart, said: &ldquo;Then I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The music struck up. I went into my room
and dressed myself in my bridal-robes of silk and
gold. I took out my jewellery and ornaments from
the safe and put them all on; I put the red mark
of wifehood on the parting in my hair. And then
under the tree in the garden I prepared my bed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>&lsquo;It was a beautiful night. The gentle south
wind was kissing away the weariness of the world.
The scent of jasmine and <i>bela</i> filled the garden
with rejoicing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When the sound of the music began to grow
fainter and fainter; the light of the moon to get
dimmer and dimmer; the world with its lifelong
associations of home and kin to fade away from
my perceptions like some illusion;&mdash;then I closed
my eyes, and smiled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fancied that when people came and found
me they would see that smile of mine lingering on
my lips like a trace of rose-coloured wine, that
when I thus slowly entered my eternal bridal-chamber
I should carry with me this smile,
illuminating my face. But alas for the bridal-chamber!
Alas for the bridal-robes of silk and
gold! When I woke at the sound of a rattling
within me, I found three urchins learning
osteology from my skeleton. Where in my
bosom my joys and griefs used to throb, and the
petals of youth to open one by one, there the
master with his pointer was busy naming my bones.
And as to that last smile, which I had so carefully
rehearsed, did you see any sign of that?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, well, how did you like the story?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45&ndash;46"> </a>&lsquo;It has been delightful,&rsquo; said I.</p>

<p>At this point the first crow began to caw.
&lsquo;Are you there?&rsquo; I asked. There was no reply.</p>

<p>The morning light entered the room.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47&ndash;48"> </a>THE AUSPICIOUS VISION</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>THE AUSPICIOUS VISION</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Kantichandra</span> was young; yet after his wife's
death he sought no second partner, and gave his
mind to the hunting of beasts and birds. His
body was long and slender, hard and agile; his
sight keen; his aim unerring. He dressed like a
countryman, and took with him Hira Singh the
wrestler, Chakkanlal, Khan Saheb the musician,
Mian Saheb, and many others. He had no lack
of idle followers.</p>

<p>In the month of <i>Agrahayan</i> Kanti had gone
out shooting near the swamp of Nydighi with a
few sporting companions. They were in boats,
and an army of servants, in boats also, filled the
bathing-<i>ghats</i>. The village women found it well-nigh
impossible to bathe or to draw water. All
day long, land and water trembled to the firing of
the guns; and every evening musicians killed the
chance of sleep.</p>

<p>One morning as Kanti was seated in his boat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
cleaning a favourite gun, he suddenly started at
what he thought was the cry of wild duck. Looking
up, he saw a village maiden, coming to the
water's edge, with two white ducklings clasped to
her breast. The little stream was almost stagnant.
Many weeds choked the current. The girl put
the birds into the water, and watched them
anxiously. Evidently the presence of the sportsmen
was the cause of her care and not the wildness
of the ducks.</p>

<p>The girl's beauty had a rare freshness&mdash;as if
she had just come from Vishwakarma's<a name="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> workshop.
It was difficult to guess her age. Her figure was
almost a woman's, but her face was so childish
that clearly the world had left no impression there.
She seemed not to know herself that she had
reached the threshold of youth.</p>

<p>Kanti's gun-cleaning stopped for a while. He
was fascinated. He had not expected to see such
a face in such a spot. And yet its beauty suited
its surroundings better than it would have suited
a palace. A bud is lovelier on the bough than in
a golden vase. That day the blossoming reeds
glittered in the autumn dew and morning sun, and
the fresh, simple face set in the midst was like a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
picture of festival to Kanti's enchanted mind.
Kalidos has forgotten to sing how Siva's Mountain-Queen
herself sometimes has come to the young
Ganges, with just such ducklings in her breast.
As he gazed, the maiden started in terror, and
hurriedly took back the ducks into her bosom
with a half-articulate cry of pain. In another
moment, she had left the river-bank and disappeared
into the bamboo thicket hard by.
Looking round, Kanti saw one of his men pointing
an unloaded gun at the ducks. He at once went
up to him, wrenched away his gun, and bestowed
on his cheek a prodigious slap. The astonished
humourist finished his joke on the floor. Kanti
went on cleaning his gun.</p>

<p>But curiosity drove Kanti to the thicket
wherein he had seen the girl disappear. Pushing
his way through, he found himself in the yard of
a well-to-do householder. On one side was a row
of conical thatched barns, on the other a clean
cow-shed, at the end of which grew a <i>zizyph</i> bush.
Under the bush was seated the girl he had seen
that morning, sobbing over a wounded dove, into
whose yellow beak she was trying to wring a little
water from the moist corner of her garment.
A grey cat, its fore-paws on her knee, was looking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
eagerly at the bird, and every now and then, when
it got too forward, she kept it in its place by a
warning tap on the nose.</p>

<p>This little picture, set in the peaceful mid-day
surroundings of the householder's yard, instantly
impressed itself on Kanti's sensitive heart. The
checkered light and shade, flickering beneath the
delicate foliage of the <i>zizyph</i>, played on the girl's
lap. Not far off a cow was chewing the cud, and
lazily keeping off the flies with slow movements
of its head and tail. The north wind whispered
softly in the rustling bamboo thickets. And she
who at dawn on the river-bank had looked like
the Forest Queen, now in the silence of noon
showed the eager pity of the Divine Housewife.
Kanti, coming in upon her with his gun, had a sense
of intrusion. He felt like a thief caught red-handed.
He longed to explain that it was not he
who had hurt the dove. As he wondered how he
should begin, there came a call of &lsquo;Sudha!&rsquo; from
the house. The girl jumped up. &lsquo;Sudha!&rsquo; came
the voice again. She took up her dove, and ran
within. &lsquo;Sudha,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> thought Kanti, &lsquo;what an appropriate
name!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kanti returned to the boat, handed his gun to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
his men, and went over to the front door of the
house. He found a middle-aged Brahmin, with
a peaceful, clean-shaven face, seated on a bench
outside, and reading a devotional book. Kanti
saw in his kindly, thoughtful face something
of the tenderness which shone in the face of the
maiden.</p>

<p>Kanti saluted him, and said: &lsquo;May I ask for
some water, sir? I am very thirsty.&rsquo; The elder
man welcomed him with eager hospitality, and,
offering him a seat on the bench, went inside
and fetched with his own hands a little brass
plate of sugar wafers and a bell-metal vessel
full of water.</p>

<p>After Kanti had eaten and drunk, the Brahmin
begged him to introduce himself. Kanti gave his
own name, his father's name, and the address of
his home, and then said in the usual way: &lsquo;If I
can be of any service, sir, I shall deem myself
fortunate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I require no service, my son,&rsquo; said Nabin
Banerji; &lsquo;I have only one care at present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that, sir?&rsquo; said Kanti.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is my daughter, Sudha, who is growing up&rsquo;
(Kanti smiled as he thought of her babyish face),
&lsquo;and for whom I have not yet been able to find a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
worthy bridegroom. If I could only see her well
married, all my debt to this world would be paid.
But there is no suitable bridegroom here, and I
cannot leave my charge of Gopinath here, to
search for a husband elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you would see me in my boat, sir, we
would have a talk about the marriage of your
daughter.&rsquo; So saying, Kanti repeated his salute
and went back. He then sent some of his men
into the village to inquire, and in answer heard
nothing but praise of the beauty and virtues of
the Brahmin's daughter.</p>

<p>When next day the old man came to the boat
on his promised visit, Kanti bent low in salutation,
and begged the hand of his daughter for himself.
The Brahmin was so much overcome by this
undreamed-of piece of good fortune&mdash;for Kanti
not only belonged to a well-known Brahmin family,
but was also a landed proprietor of wealth and
position&mdash;that at first he could hardly utter a
word in reply. He thought there must have been
some mistake, and at length mechanically repeated:
&lsquo;You desire to marry my daughter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you will deign to give her to me,&rsquo; said
Kanti.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mean Sudha?&rsquo; he asked again.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But will you not first see and speak to
her<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kanti, pretending he had not seen her already,
said: &lsquo;Oh, that we shall do at the moment of the
Auspicious Vision.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In a voice husky with emotion the old man
said: &lsquo;My Sudha is indeed a good girl, well skilled
in all the household arts. As you are so generously
taking her on trust, may she never cause
you a moment's regret. This is my blessing!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The brick-built mansion of the Mazumdars
had been borrowed for the wedding ceremony,
which was fixed for next <i>Magh</i>, as Kanti did
not wish to delay. In due time the bridegroom
arrived on his elephant, with drums and music
and with a torchlight procession, and the ceremony
began.</p>

<p>When the bridal couple were covered with the
scarlet screen for the rite of the Auspicious Vision,
Kanti looked up at his bride. In that bashful,
downcast face, crowned with the wedding coronet
and bedecked with sandal paste, he could scarcely
recognise the village maiden of his fancy, and in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
the fulness of his emotion a mist seemed to becloud
his eyes.</p>

<p>At the gathering of women in the bridal
chamber, after the wedding ceremony was over,
an old village dame insisted that Kanti himself
should take off his wife's bridal veil. As he did
so he started back. It was not the same girl.</p>

<p>Something rose from within his breast and
pierced into his brain. The light of the lamps
seemed to grow dim, and darkness to tarnish the
face of the bride herself.</p>

<p>At first he felt angry with his father-in-law.
The old scoundrel had shown him one girl, and
married him to another. But on calmer reflection
he remembered that the old man had not shown
him any daughter at all&mdash;that it was all his own
fault. He thought it best not to show his arrant
folly to the world, and took his place again with
apparent calmness.</p>

<p>He could swallow the powder; he could not
get rid of its taste. He could not bear the merry-makings
of the festive throng. He was in a
blaze of anger with himself as well as with everybody
else.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt the bride, seated by his side,
give a little start and a suppressed scream; a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
leveret, scampering into the room, had brushed
across her feet. Close upon it followed the girl
he had seen before. She caught up the leveret
into her arms, and began to caress it with an
affectionate murmuring. &lsquo;Oh, the mad girl!&rsquo;
cried the women as they made signs to her
to leave the room. She heeded them not, however,
but came and unconcernedly sat in front of
the wedded pair, looking into their faces with a
childish curiosity. When a maidservant came and
took her by the arm to lead her away, Kanti
hurriedly interposed, saying, &lsquo;Let her be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; he then went on to ask
her.</p>

<p>The girl swayed backwards and forwards but
gave no reply. All the women in the room began
to titter.</p>

<p>Kanti put another question: &lsquo;Have those
ducklings of yours grown up?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl stared at him as unconcernedly as
before.</p>

<p>The bewildered Kanti screwed up courage for
another effort, and asked tenderly after the
wounded dove, but with no avail. The increasing
laughter in the room betokened an amusing joke.</p>

<p>At last Kanti learned that the girl was deaf
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
and dumb, the companion of all the animals and
birds of the locality. It was but by chance that
she rose the other day when the name of Sudha
was called.</p>

<p>Kanti now received a second shock. A black
screen lifted from before his eyes. With a sigh
of intense relief, as of escape from calamity, he
looked once more into the face of his bride.
Then came the true Auspicious Vision. The light
from his heart and from the smokeless lamps fell
on her gracious face; and he saw it in its true
radiance, knowing that Nabin's blessing would find
fulfilment.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59&ndash;60"> </a>THE SUPREME NIGHT</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>THE SUPREME NIGHT</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">I used</span> to go to the same dame's school with
Surabala and play at marriage with her. When
I paid visits to her house, her mother would pet
me, and setting us side by side would say to herself:
&lsquo;What a lovely pair!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I was a child then, but I could understand her
meaning well enough. The idea became rooted
in my mind that I had a special right to Surabala
above that of people in general. So it happened
that, in the pride of ownership, at times I punished
and tormented her; and she, too, fagged for me
and bore all my punishments without complaint.
The village was wont to praise her beauty; but
in the eyes of a young barbarian like me that
beauty had no glory;&mdash;I knew only that Surabala
had been born in her father's house solely to bear
my yoke, and that therefore she was the particular
object of my neglect.</p>

<p>My father was the land-steward of the Chaudhuris,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
a family of <i>zemindars</i>. It was his plan, as
soon as I had learnt to write a good hand, to
train me in the work of estate management and
secure a rent collectorship for me somewhere.
But in my heart I disliked the proposal. Nilratan
of our village had run away to Calcutta, had
learnt English there, and finally became the <i>Nazir</i><a name="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
of the District Magistrate; <em>that</em> was my life's
ideal: I was secretly determined to be the Head
Clerk of the Judge's Court, even if I could not
become the Magistrate's <i>Nazir</i>.</p>

<p>I saw that my father always treated these court
officers with the greatest respect. I knew from
my childhood that they had to be propitiated with
gifts of fish, vegetables, and even money. For
this reason I had given a seat of high honour in
my heart to the court underlings, even to the
bailiffs. These are the gods worshipped in our
Bengal,&mdash;a modern miniature edition of the 330
millions of deities of the Hindu pantheon. For
gaining material success, people have more genuine
faith in <em>them</em> than in the good Ganesh, the giver
of success; hence the people now offer to these
officers everything that was formerly Ganesh's
due.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>Fired by the example of Nilratan, I too seized
a suitable opportunity and ran away to Calcutta.
There I first put up in the house of a village
acquaintance, and afterwards got some funds from
my father for my education. Thus I carried on
my studies regularly.</p>

<p>In addition, I joined political and benevolent
societies. I had no doubt whatever that it was
urgently necessary for me to give my life suddenly
for my country. But I knew not how such a hard
task could be carried out. Also no one showed
me the way.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, my enthusiasm did not abate
at all. We country lads had not learnt to sneer
at everything like the precocious boys of Calcutta,
and hence our faith was very strong. The
&lsquo;leaders&rsquo; of our associations delivered speeches,
and we went begging for subscriptions from door
to door in the hot blaze of noon without breaking
our fast; or we stood by the roadside distributing
hand-bills, or arranged the chairs and benches in
the lecture-hall, and, if anybody whispered a word
against our leader, we got ready to fight him.
For these things the city boys used to laugh at us
as provincials.</p>

<p>I had come to Calcutta to be a <i>Nazir</i> or a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
Head Clerk, but I was preparing to become a
Mazzini or a Garibaldi.</p>

<p>At this time Surabala's father and my father
laid their heads together to unite us in marriage.
I had come to Calcutta at the age of fifteen;
Surabala was eight years old then. I was now
eighteen, and in my father's opinion I was almost
past the age of marriage. But it was my secret
vow to remain unmarried all my life and to die
for my country; so I told my father that I
would not marry before I had finished my
education.</p>

<p>In two or three months I learnt that Surabala
had been married to a pleader named Ram Lochan.
I was then busy collecting subscriptions for raising
fallen India, and this news did not seem worth my
thought.</p>

<p>I had matriculated, and was about to appear at
the Intermediate Examination, when my father
died. I was not alone in the world, but had to
maintain my mother and two sisters. I had therefore
to leave college and look out for employment.
After a good deal of exertion I secured the post
of second master in the matriculation school of a
small town in the Noakhali District.</p>

<p>I thought, here is just the work for me! By
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
my advice and inspiration I shall train up every
one of my pupils as a general for future India.</p>

<p>I began to work, and then found that the impending
examination was a more pressing affair
than the future of India. The headmaster got
angry whenever I talked of anything outside
grammar or algebra. And in a few months my
enthusiasm, too, flagged.</p>

<p>I am no genius. In the quiet of the home I
may form vast plans; but when I enter the field of
work, I have to bear the yoke of the plough on
my neck like the Indian bullock, get my tail
twisted by my master, break clods all day, patiently
and with bowed head, and then at sunset have to
be satisfied if I can get any cud to chew. Such a
creature has not the spirit to prance and caper.</p>

<p>One of the teachers lived in the school-house, to
guard against fires. As I was a bachelor, this work
was thrown on me. I lodged in a thatched shed
close to the large cottage in which the school sat.</p>

<p>The school-house stood at some distance from
the inhabited portion of the town, and beside a
big tank. Around it were betel-nut, cocoa-nut,
and <i>madar</i> trees, and very near to the school
building two large ancient <i>nim</i> trees grew close
together, and cast a cool shade around.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>One thing I have forgotten to mention, and
indeed I had not so long considered it worth
mentioning. The local Government pleader, Ram
Lochan Ray, lived near our school. I also knew
that his wife&mdash;my early playmate, Surabala&mdash;lived
with him.</p>

<p>I got acquainted with Ram Lochan Babu. I
cannot say whether he knew that I had known
Surabala in childhood. I did not think fit to
mention the fact at my first introduction to him.
Indeed, I did not clearly remember that Surabala
had been ever linked with my life in any way.</p>

<p>One holiday I paid a visit to Ram Lochan Babu.
The subject of our conversation has gone out of
my mind; probably it was the unhappy condition
of present-day India. Not that he was very much
concerned or heart-broken over the matter; but
the subject was such that one could freely pour
forth one's sentimental sorrow over it for an hour
or two while puffing at one's <i>hooka</i>.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, I heard in a side-room
the softest possible jingle of bracelets, crackle of
dress, and footfall; and I felt certain that two
curious eyes were watching me through a small
opening of the window.</p>

<p>All at once there flashed upon my memory a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
pair of eyes,&mdash;a pair of large eyes, beaming with
trust, simplicity, and girlhood's love,&mdash;black pupils,&mdash;thick
dark eyelashes,&mdash;a calm fixed gaze.
Suddenly some unseen force squeezed my heart
in an iron grip, and it throbbed with intense pain.</p>

<p>I returned to my house, but the pain clung to
me. Whether I read, wrote, or did any other
work, I could not shake that weight off my heart;
a heavy load seemed to be always swinging from
my heart-strings.</p>

<p>In the evening, calming myself a little, I began
to reflect: &lsquo;What ails me?&rsquo; From within came
the question: &lsquo;Where is <em>your</em> Surabala now?&rsquo; I
replied: &lsquo;I gave her up of my free will. Surely
I did not expect her to wait for me for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But something kept saying: &lsquo;<em>Then</em> you could
have got her merely for the asking. <em>Now</em> you
have not the right to look at her even once, do
what you will. That Surabala of your boyhood
may come very close to you; you may hear the
jingle of her bracelets; you may breathe the air
embalmed by the essence of her hair,&mdash;but there
will always be a wall between you two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I answered: &lsquo;Be it so. What is Surabala to
me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>My heart rejoined: &lsquo;To-day Surabala is nobody
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
to you. But what might she not have been to
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ah! that's true. <em>What</em> might she not have
been to me? Dearest to me of all things, closer
to me than the world besides, the sharer of all my
life's joys and sorrows,&mdash;she might have been.
And now, she is so distant, so much of a stranger,
that to look on her is forbidden, to talk with her
is improper, and to think of her is a sin!&mdash;while
this Ram Lochan, coming suddenly from nowhere,
has muttered a few set religious texts, and in one
swoop has carried off Surabala from the rest of
mankind!</p>

<p>I have not come to preach a new ethical code,
or to revolutionise society; I have no wish to
tear asunder domestic ties. I am only expressing
the exact working of my mind, though it may
not be reasonable. I could not by any means
banish from my mind the sense that Surabala,
reigning there within shelter of Ram Lochan's
home, was mine far more than his. The thought
was, I admit, unreasonable and improper,&mdash;but it
was not unnatural.</p>

<p>Thereafter I could not set my mind to any
kind of work. At noon when the boys in my
class hummed, when Nature outside simmered in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
the sun, when the sweet scent of the <i>nim</i> blossoms
entered the room on the tepid breeze, I then
wished,&mdash;I know not what I wished for; but this
I can say, that I did not wish to pass all my life in
correcting the grammar exercises of those future
hopes of India.</p>

<p>When school was over, I could not bear to live
in my large lonely house; and yet, if any one paid
me a visit, it bored me. In the gloaming as I sat
by the tank and listened to the meaningless breeze
sighing through the betel- and cocoa-nut palms, I
used to muse that human society is a web of
mistakes; nobody has the sense to do the right
thing at the right time, and when the chance is
gone we break our hearts over vain longings.</p>

<p>I could have married Surabala and lived happily.
But I must be a Garibaldi,&mdash;and I ended by
becoming the second master of a village school!
And pleader Ram Lochan Ray, who had no
special call to be Surabala's husband,&mdash;to whom,
before his marriage, Surabala was no wise different
from a hundred other maidens,&mdash;has very quietly
married her, and is earning lots of money as
Government pleader; when his dinner is badly
cooked he scolds Surabala, and when he is in good
humour he gives her a bangle! He is sleek and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
fat, tidily dressed, free from every kind of worry;
<em>he</em> never passes his evenings by the tank gazing at
the stars and sighing.</p>

<p>Ram Lochan was called away from our town
for a few days by a big case elsewhere. Surabala
in her house was as lonely as I was in my school
building.</p>

<p>I remember it was a Monday. The sky was
overcast with clouds from the morning. It began
to drizzle at ten o'clock. At the aspect of the
heavens our headmaster closed the school early.
All day the black detached clouds began to run
about in the sky as if making ready for some grand
display. Next day, towards afternoon, the rain
descended in torrents, accompanied by storm.
As the night advanced the fury of wind and
water increased. At first the wind was easterly;
gradually it veered, and blew towards the south
and south-west.</p>

<p>It was idle to try to sleep on such a night. I
remembered that in this terrible weather Surabala
was alone in her house. Our school was much
more strongly built than her bungalow. Often and
often did I plan to invite her to the school-house,
while I meant to pass the night alone by the tank.
But I could not summon up courage for it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>When it was half-past one in the morning, the
roar of the tidal wave was suddenly heard,&mdash;the
sea was rushing on us! I left my room and ran
towards Surabala's house. In the way stood one
embankment of our tank, and as I was wading to
it the flood already reached my knees. When I
mounted the bank, a second wave broke on it.
The highest part of the bank was more than
seventeen feet above the plain.</p>

<p>As I climbed up the bank, another person reached
it from the opposite side. Who she was, every
fibre of my body knew at once, and my whole
soul was thrilled with the consciousness. I had no
doubt that she, too, had recognised me.</p>

<p>On an island some three yards in area stood
we two; all else was covered with water.</p>

<p>It was a time of cataclysm; the stars had been
blotted out of the sky; all the lights of the earth
had been darkened; there would have been no
harm if we had held converse <em>then</em>. But we could
not bring ourselves to utter a word; neither of
us made even a formal inquiry after the other's
health. Only we stood gazing at the darkness.
At our feet swirled the dense, black, wild, roaring
torrent of death.</p>

<p>To-day Surabala has come to <em>my</em> side, leaving
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
the whole world. To-day she has none besides <em>me</em>.
In our far-off childhood this Surabala had come
from some dark primeval realm of mystery, from a
life in another orb, and stood by my side on this
luminous peopled earth; and to-day, after a wide
span of time, she has left that earth, so full of
light and human beings, to stand alone by <em>my</em> side
amidst this terrible desolate gloom of Nature's
death-convulsion. The stream of birth had flung
that tender bud before me, and the flood of death
had wafted the same flower, now in full bloom, to
<em>me</em> and to none else. One more wave and we shall
be swept away from this extreme point of the earth,
torn from the stalks on which we now sit apart,
and made one in death.</p>

<p>May that wave never come! May Surabala
live long and happily, girt round by husband and
children, household and kinsfolk! This one
night, standing on the brink of Nature's destruction,
I have tasted eternal bliss.</p>

<p>The night wore out, the tempest ceased, the
flood abated; without a word spoken, Surabala
went back to her house, and I, too, returned to
my shed without having uttered a word.</p>

<p>I reflected: True, I have become no <i>Nazir</i> or
Head Clerk, nor a Garibaldi; I am only the second
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73&ndash;74"> </a>
master of a beggarly school. But one night had
for its brief space beamed upon my whole life's
course.</p>

<p>That one night, out of all the days and nights
of my allotted span, has been the supreme glory of
my humble existence.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75&ndash;76"> </a>RAJA AND RANI</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>RAJA AND RANI</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Bipin Kisore</span> was born &lsquo;with a golden spoon in
his mouth&rsquo;; hence he knew how to squander
money twice as well as how to earn it. The
natural result was that he could not live long in
the house where he was born.</p>

<p>He was a delicate young man of comely appearance,
an adept in music, a fool in business, and
unfit for life's handicap. He rolled along life's
road like the wheel of Jagannath's car. He could
not long command his wonted style of magnificent
living.</p>

<p>Luckily, however, Raja Chittaranjan, having
got back his property from the Court of Wards,
was intent upon organising an Amateur Theatre
Party. Captivated by the prepossessing looks of
Bipin Kisore and his musical endowments, the
Raja gladly &lsquo;admitted him of his crew.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Chittaranjan was a B.A. He was not given
to any excesses. Though the son of a rich man,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
he used to dine and sleep at appointed hours
and even at appointed places. And he suddenly
became enamoured of Bipin like one unto drink.
Often did meals cool and nights grow old while
he listened to Bipin and discussed with him the
merits of operatic compositions. The Dewan
remarked that the only blemish in the otherwise
perfect character of his master was his inordinate
fondness for Bipin Kisore.</p>

<p>Rani Basanta Kumari raved at her husband,
and said that he was wasting himself on a luckless
baboon. The sooner she could do away with him,
the easier she would feel.</p>

<p>The Raja was much pleased in his heart at this
seeming jealousy of his youthful wife. He smiled,
and thought that women-folk know only one
man upon the earth&mdash;him whom they love; and
never think of other men's deserts. That there
may be many whose merits deserve regard, is not
recorded in the scriptures of women. The only
good man and the only object of a woman's favours
is he who has blabbered into her ears the matrimonial
incantations. A little moment behind the
usual hour of her husband's meals is a world of
anxiety to her, but she never cares a brass button
if her husband's dependents have a mouthful or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
not. This inconsiderate partiality of the softer
sex might be cavilled at, but to Chittaranjan it
did not seem unpleasant. Thus, he would often
indulge in hyperbolic laudations of Bipin in his
wife's presence, just to provoke a display of her
delightful fulminations.</p>

<p>But what was sport to the &lsquo;royal&rsquo; couple, was
death to poor Bipin. The servants of the house,
as is their wont, took their cue from the Rani's
apathetic and wilful neglect of the wretched
hanger-on, and grew more apathetic and wilful
still. They contrived to forget to look after his
comforts, to Bipin's infinite chagrin and untold
sufferings.</p>

<p>Once the Rani rebuked the servant Puté, and
said: &lsquo;You are always shirking work; what do
you do all through the day?&rsquo; &lsquo;Pray, madam, the
whole day is taken up in serving Bipin Babu
under the Maharaja's orders,&rsquo; stammered the poor
valet.</p>

<p>The Rani retorted: &lsquo;Your Bipin Babu is a great
Nawab, eh?&rsquo; This was enough for Puté. He
took the hint. From the very next day he left
Bipin Babu's orts as they were, and at times forgot
to cover the food for him. With unpractised
hands Bipin often scoured his own dishes and not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>
unfrequently went without meals. But it was not
in him to whine and report to the Raja. It was
not in him to lower himself by petty squabblings
with menials. He did not mind it; he took
everything in good part. And thus while the
Raja's favours grew, the Rani's disfavour intensified,
and at last knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Now the opera of <i>Subhadraharan</i> was ready
after due rehearsal. The stage was fitted up in
the palace court-yard. The Raja acted the part
of &lsquo;Krishna,&rsquo; and Bipin that of &lsquo;Arjuna.&rsquo; Oh,
how sweetly he sang! how beautiful he looked!
The audience applauded in transports of joy.</p>

<p>The play over, the Raja came to the Rani and
asked her how she liked it. The Rani replied:
&lsquo;Indeed, Bipin acted the part of &ldquo;Arjuna&rdquo; gloriously!
He does look like the scion of a noble
family. His voice is rare!&rsquo; The Raja said
jocosely: &lsquo;And how do I look? Am I not fair?
Have I not a sweet voice?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, yours is
different case!&rsquo; added the Rani, and again fell to
dilating on the histrionic abilities of Bipin Kisore.</p>

<p>The tables were now turned. He who used
to praise, now began to deprecate. The Raja, who
was never weary of indulging in high-sounding
panegyrics of Bipin before his consort, now
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
suddenly fell reflecting that, after all, unthinking
people made too much of Bipin's actual merits.
What was extraordinary about his appearance or
voice? A short while before he himself was
one of those unthinking men, but in a sudden
and mysterious way he developed symptoms of
thoughtfulness!</p>

<p>From the day following, every good arrangement
was made for Bipin's meals. The Rani told
the Raja: &lsquo;It is undoubtedly wrong to lodge
Bipin Babu with the petty officers of the Raj in
the Kachari<a name="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; for all he now is, he was once a man
of means.&rsquo; The Raja ejaculated curtly: &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo;
and turned the subject. The Rani proposed that
there might be another performance on the occasion
of the first-rice ceremony of the &lsquo;royal&rsquo; weanling.
The Raja heard and heard her not.</p>

<p>Once on being reprimanded by the Raja for
not properly laying his cloth, the servant Puté
replied: &lsquo;What can I do? According to the
Rani's behests I have to look after Bipin Babu and
wait on him the livelong day.&rsquo; This angered the
Raja, and he exclaimed, highly nettled: &lsquo;Pshaw!
Bipin Babu is a veritable Nawab, I see! Can't he
cleanse his own dishes himself?&rsquo; The servant, as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
before, took his cue, and Bipin lapsed back into
his former wretchedness.</p>

<p>The Rani liked Bipin's songs&mdash;they were sweet&mdash;there
was no gainsaying it. When her husband
sat with Bipin to the wonted discourses of sweet
music of an evening, she would listen from behind
the screen in an adjoining room. Not long afterwards,
the Raja began again his old habit of dining
and sleeping at regular hours. The music came
to an end. Bipin's evening services were no more
needed.</p>

<p>Raja Chittaranjan used to look after his
<i>zemindari</i> affairs at noon. One day he came
earlier to the zenana, and found his consort reading
something. On his asking her what she read,
the Rani was a little taken aback, but promptly
replied: &lsquo;I am conning over a few songs from
Bipin Babu's song-book. We have not had any
music since you tired abruptly of your musical
hobby.&rsquo; Poor woman! it was she who had herself
made no end of efforts to eradicate the hobby
from her husband's mind.</p>

<p>On the morrow the Raja dismissed Bipin&mdash;without
a thought as to how and where the poor
fellow would get a morsel henceforth!</p>

<p>Nor was this the only matter of regret to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83&ndash;84"> </a>
Bipin. He had been bound to the Raja by the
dearest and most sincere tie of attachment. He
served him more for affection than for pay. He
was fonder of his friend than of the wages he
received. Even after deep cogitation, Bipin could
not ascertain the cause of the Raja's sudden
estrangement. &lsquo;'Tis Fate! all is Fate!&rsquo; Bipin
said to himself. And then, silently and bravely,
he heaved a deep sigh, picked up his old guitar,
put it up in the case, paid the last two coins in his
pocket as a farewell <i>bakshish</i> to Puté, and walked
out into the wide wide world where he had not a
soul to call his friend.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85&ndash;86"> </a>THE TRUST PROPERTY</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>THE TRUST PROPERTY</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Brindaban Kundu</span> came to his father in a rage
and said: &lsquo;I am off this moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ungrateful wretch!&rsquo; sneered the father,
Jaganath Kundu. &lsquo;When you have paid me
back all that I have spent on your food and clothing,
it will be time enough to give yourself these
airs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Such food and clothing as was customary in
Jaganath's household could not have cost very
much. Our <i>rishis</i> of old managed to feed and
clothe themselves on an incredibly small outlay.
Jaganath's behaviour showed that his ideal in these
respects was equally high. That he could not
fully live up to it was due partly to the bad influence
of the degenerate society around him, and
partly to certain unreasonable demands of Nature
in her attempt to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p>So long as Brindaban was single, things went
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
smoothly enough, but after his marriage he began
to depart from the high and rarefied standard
cherished by his sire. It was clear that the son's
ideas of comfort were moving away from the
spiritual to the material, and imitating the ways
of the world. He was unwilling to put up
with the discomforts of heat and cold, thirst and
hunger. His minimum of food and clothing rose
apace.</p>

<p>Frequent were the quarrels between the father
and the son. At last Brindaban's wife became
seriously ill and a <i>kabiraj</i><a name="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> was called in. But
when the doctor prescribed a costly medicine for
his patient, Jaganath took it as a proof of sheer
incompetence, and turned him out immediately.
At first Brindaban besought his father to allow the
treatment to continue; then he quarrelled with
him about it, but to no purpose. When his wife
died, he abused his father and called him a
murderer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said the father. &lsquo;Don't people die
even after swallowing all kinds of drugs? If
costly medicines could save life, how is it that
kings and emperors are not immortal? You don't
expect your wife to die with more pomp and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
ceremony than did your mother and your grandmother
before her, do you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Brindaban might really have derived a great
consolation from these words, had he not been
overwhelmed with grief and incapable of proper
thinking. Neither his mother nor his grandmother
had taken any medicine before making
their exit from this world, and this was the time-honoured
custom of the family. But, alas, the
younger generation was unwilling to die according
to ancient custom. The English had newly come
to the country at the time we speak of. Even in
those remote days, the good old folks were horrified
at the unorthodox ways of the new generation,
and sat speechless, trying to draw comfort from
their <i>hookas</i>.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the modern Brindaban said
to his old fogy of a father: &lsquo;I am off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The father instantly agreed, and wished publicly
that, should he ever give his son one single pice in
future, the gods might reckon his act as shedding
the holy blood of cows. Brindaban in his turn
similarly wished that, should he ever accept anything
from his father, his act might be held as bad
as matricide.</p>

<p>The people of the village looked upon this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
small revolution as a great relief after a long period
of monotony. And when Jaganath disinherited
his only son, every one did his best to console him.
All were unanimous in the opinion that to quarrel
with a father for the sake of a wife was possible
only in these degenerate days. And the reason
they gave was sound too. &lsquo;When your wife dies,&rsquo;
they said, &lsquo;you can find a second one without delay.
But when your father dies, you can't get another
to replace him for love or money.&rsquo; Their logic
no doubt was perfect, but we suspect that the
utter hopelessness of getting another father did
not trouble the misguided son very much. On
the contrary, he looked upon it as a mercy.</p>

<p>Nor did separation from Brindaban weigh
heavily on the mind of his father. In the first
place, his absence from home reduced the household
expenses. Then, again, the father was freed
from a great anxiety. The fear of being poisoned
by his son and heir had always haunted him.
When he ate his scanty fare, he could never banish
the thought of poison from his mind. This fear
had abated somewhat after the death of his
daughter-in-law, and, now that the son was gone,
it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>But there was one tender spot in the old man's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
heart. Brindaban had taken away with him his
four-year-old son, Gokul Chandra. Now, the
expense of keeping the child was comparatively
small, and so Jaganath's affection for him was
without a drawback. Still, when Brindaban took
him away, his grief, sincere as it was, was mingled
at first with calculation as to how much he would
save a month by the absence of the two, how much
the sum would come to in the year, and what
would be the capital to bring it in as interest.</p>

<p>But the empty house, without Gokul Chandra
in it to make mischief, became more and more
difficult for the old man to live in. There was no
one now to play tricks upon him when he was
engaged in his <i>puja</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> no one to snatch away his
food and eat it, no one to run away with his inkpot,
when he was writing up his accounts. His
daily routine of life, now uninterrupted, became
an intolerable burden to him. He bethought him
that this unworried peace was endurable only in
the world to come. When he caught sight of the
holes made in his quilt by his grandchild, and the
pen-and-ink sketches executed by the same artist
on his rush-mat, his heart was heavy with grief.
Once upon a time he had reproached the boy
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
bitterly because he had torn his <i>dhoti</i> into pieces
within the short space of two years; now tears
stood in Jaganath's eyes as he gazed upon the
dirty remnants lying in the bedroom. He carefully
put them away in his safe, and registered a
vow that, should Gokul ever come back again, he
should not be reprimanded even if he destroyed
one <i>dhoti</i> a year.</p>

<p>But Gokul did not return, and poor Jaganath
aged rapidly. His empty home seemed emptier
every day.</p>

<p>No longer could the old man stay peacefully at
home. Even in the middle of the day, when all
respectable folks in the village enjoyed their after-dinner
siesta, Jaganath might be seen roaming over
the village, <i>hooka</i> in hand. The boys, at sight of
him, would give up their play, and, retiring in a
body to a safe distance, chant verses composed by
a local poet, praising the old gentleman's economical
habits. No one ventured to say his real name,
lest he should have to go without his meal that
day<a name="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;and so people gave him names after their
own fancy. Elderly people called him Jaganash,<a name="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
but the reason why the younger generation preferred
to call him a vampire was hard to guess.
It may be that the bloodless, dried-up skin of the
old man had some physical resemblance to the
vampire's.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>One afternoon, when Jaganath was rambling as
usual through the village lanes shaded by mango
topes, he saw a boy, apparently a stranger, assuming
the captaincy of the village boys and explaining to
them the scheme of some new prank. Won by
the force of his character and the startling novelty
of his ideas, the boys had all sworn allegiance to
him. Unlike the others, he did not run away
from the old man as he approached, but came
quite close to him and began to shake his own
<i>chadar</i>. The result was that a live lizard sprang
out of it on to the old man's body, ran down his
back and off towards the jungle. Sudden fright
made the poor man shiver from head to foot, to
the great amusement of the other boys, who shouted
with glee. Before Jaganath had gone far, cursing
and swearing, the <i>gamcha</i> on his shoulder suddenly
disappeared, and the next moment it was seen on
the head of the new boy, transformed into a
turban.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>The novel attentions of this manikin came as a
great relief to Jaganath. It was long since any
boy had taken such freedom with him. After a
good deal of coaxing and many fair promises, he
at last persuaded the boy to come to him, and this
was the conversation which followed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What's your name, my boy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nitai Pal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where's your home?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Won't tell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who's your father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Won't tell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why won't you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because I have run away from home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What made you do it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father wanted to send me to school.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It occurred to Jaganath that it would be useless
extravagance to send such a boy to school, and his
father must have been an unpractical fool not to
have thought so.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Jaganath, &lsquo;how would you
like to come and stay with me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don't mind,&rsquo; said the boy, and forthwith he
installed himself in Jaganath's house. He felt as
little hesitation as though it were the shadow of
a tree by the wayside. And not only that. He
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
began to proclaim his wishes as regards his food
and clothing with such coolness that you would
have thought he had paid his reckoning in full
beforehand; and, when anything went wrong, he
did not scruple to quarrel with the old man. It
had been easy enough for Jaganath to get the better
of his own child; but, now, where another man's
child was concerned, he had to acknowledge defeat.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The people of the village marvelled when
Nitai Pal was unexpectedly made so much of by
Jaganath. They felt sure that the old man's end
was near, and the prospect of his bequeathing all
his property to this unknown brat made their
hearts sore. Furious with envy, they determined
to do the boy an injury, but the old man took care
of him as though he was a rib in his breast.</p>

<p>At times, the boy threatened that he would go
away, and the old man used to say to him temptingly:
&lsquo;I will leave you all the property I possess.&rsquo;
Young as he was, the boy fully understood the
grandeur of this promise.</p>

<p>The village people then began to make inquiries
after the father of the boy. Their hearts melted
with compassion for the agonised parents, and they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
declared that the son must be a rascal to cause
them so much suffering. They heaped abuses on
his head, but the heat with which they did it
betrayed envy rather than a sense of justice.</p>

<p>One day the old man learned from a wayfarer
that one Damodar Pal was seeking his lost son,
and was even now coming towards the village.
Nitai, when he heard this, became very restless
and was ready to run away, leaving his future
wealth to take care of itself. Jaganath reassured
him, saying: &lsquo;I mean to hide you where nobody
can find you&mdash;not even the village people
themselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This whetted the curiosity of the boy and he
said: &lsquo;Oh, where? Do show me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;People will know, if I show you now. Wait
till it is night,&rsquo; said Jaganath.</p>

<p>The hope of discovering the mysterious hiding-place
delighted Nitai. He planned to himself how,
as soon as his father had gone away without him,
he would have a bet with his comrades, and play
hide-and-seek. Nobody would be able to find
him. Wouldn't it be fun? His father, too, would
ransack the whole village, and not find him&mdash;that
would be rare fun also.</p>

<p>At noon, Jaganath shut the boy up in his house,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
and disappeared for some time. When he came
home again, Nitai worried him with questions.</p>

<p>No sooner was it dark than Nitai said: &lsquo;Grandfather,
shall we go now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It isn't night yet,&rsquo; replied Jaganath.</p>

<p>A little while later the boy exclaimed: &lsquo;It is
night now, grandfather; come let's go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The village people haven't gone to bed yet,&rsquo;
whispered Jaganath.</p>

<p>Nitai waited but a moment, and said: &lsquo;They
have gone to bed now, grandfather; I am sure they
have. Let's start now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The night advanced. Sleep began to weigh
heavily on the eyelids of the poor boy, and it was
a hard struggle for him to keep awake. At midnight,
Jaganath caught hold of the boy's arm, and
left the house, groping through the dark lanes
of the sleeping village. Not a sound disturbed
the stillness, except the occasional howl of a dog,
when all the other dogs far and near would join in
chorus, or perhaps the flapping of a night-bird,
scared by the sound of human footsteps at that
unusual hour. Nitai trembled with fear, and held
Jaganath fast by the arm.</p>

<p>Across many a field they went, and at last came
to a jungle, where stood a dilapidated temple
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
without a god in it. &lsquo;What, here!&rsquo; exclaimed
Nitai in a tone of disappointment. It was nothing
like what he had imagined. There was not much
mystery about it. Often, since running away from
home, he had passed nights in deserted temples like
this. It was not a bad place for playing hide-and-seek;
still it was quite possible that his comrades
might track him there.</p>

<p>From the middle of the floor inside, Jaganath
removed a slab of stone, and an underground room
with a lamp burning in it was revealed to the
astonished eyes of the boy. Fear and curiosity
assailed his little heart. Jaganath descended by a
ladder and Nitai followed him.</p>

<p>Looking around, the boy saw that there were
brass <i>ghurras</i><a name="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> on all sides of him. In the middle
lay spread an <i>assan</i><a name="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, and in front of it were
arranged vermilion, sandal paste, flowers, and other
articles of <i>puja</i>. To satisfy his curiosity the boy
dipped his hand into some of the <i>ghurras</i>, and
drew out their contents. They were rupees and
gold <i>mohurs</i>.</p>

<p>Jaganath, addressing the boy, said: &lsquo;I told you,
Nitai, that I would give you all my money. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
have not got much,&mdash;these <i>ghurras</i> are all that I
possess. These I will make over to you to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy jumped with delight. &lsquo;All?&rsquo; he
exclaimed; &lsquo;you won't take back a rupee, will
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I do,&rsquo; said the old man in solemn tones,
&lsquo;may my hand be attacked with leprosy. But
there is one condition. If ever my grandson,
Gokul Chandra, or his son, or his grandson, or his
great-grandson or any of his progeny should happen
to pass this way, then you must make over to
him, or to them, every rupee and every <i>mohur</i>
here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy thought that the old man was raving.
&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then sit on this <i>assan</i>,&rsquo; said Jaganath.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because <i>puja</i> will be done to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo; said the boy, taken aback.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is the rule.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy squatted on the <i>assan</i> as he was told.
Jaganath smeared his forehead with sandal paste,
put a mark of vermilion between his eyebrows,
flung a garland of flowers round his neck, and
began to recite <i>mantras</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>To sit there like a god, and hear <i>mantras</i> recited
made poor Nitai feel very uneasy. &lsquo;Grandfather,&rsquo;
he whispered.</p>

<p>But Jaganath did not reply, and went on
muttering his incantations.</p>

<p>Finally, with great difficulty he dragged each
<i>ghurra</i> before the boy and made him repeat the
following vow after him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do solemnly promise that I will make over
all this treasure to Gokul Chandra Kundu, the son
of Brindaban Kundu, the grandson of Jaganath
Kundu, or to the son or to the grandson or to
the great-grandson of the said Gokul Chandra
Kundu, or to any other progeny of his who may
be the rightful heir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy repeated this over and over again,
until he felt stupefied, and his tongue began to
grow stiff in his mouth. When the ceremony was
over, the air of the cave was laden with the smoke
of the earthen lamp and the breath-poison of the
two. The boy felt that the roof of his mouth had
become dry as dust, and his hands and feet were
burning. He was nearly suffocated.</p>

<p>The lamp became dimmer and dimmer, and
then went out altogether. In the total darkness
that followed, Nitai could hear the old man climbing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
up the ladder. &lsquo;Grandfather, where are you
going to?&rsquo; said he, greatly distressed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am going now,&rsquo; replied Jaganath; &lsquo;you
remain here. No one will be able to find you.
Remember the name Gokul Chandra, the son of
Brindaban, and the grandson of Jaganath.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He then withdrew the ladder. In a stifled,
agonised voice the boy implored: &lsquo;I want to go
back to father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jaganath replaced the slab. He then knelt
down and placed his ear on the stone. Nitai's
voice was heard once more&mdash;&lsquo;Father&rsquo;&mdash;and then
came a sound of some heavy object falling with a
bump&mdash;and then&mdash;everything was still.</p>

<p>Having thus placed his wealth in the hands of
a <i>yak</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Jaganath began to cover up the stone with
earth. Then he piled broken bricks and loose
mortar over it. On the top of all he planted turfs
of grass and jungle weeds. The night was almost
spent, but he could not tear himself away from the
spot. Now and again he placed his ear to the
ground, and tried to listen. It seemed to him that
from far far below&mdash;from the abysmal depth of the
earth's interior&mdash;came a wailing. It seemed to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
him that the night-sky was flooded with that one
sound, that the sleeping humanity of all the world
was awake, and was sitting on its beds, trying to
listen.</p>

<p>The old man in his frenzy kept on heaping
earth higher and higher. He wanted somehow to
stifle that sound, but still he fancied he could hear
&lsquo;Father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He struck the spot with all his might and said:
&lsquo;Be quiet&mdash;people might hear you.&rsquo; But still he
imagined he heard &lsquo;Father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The sun lighted up the eastern horizon.
Jaganath then left the temple, and came into the
open fields.</p>

<p>There, too, somebody called out &lsquo;Father.&rsquo;
Startled at the sound, he turned back and saw his
son at his heels.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Brindaban, &lsquo;I hear my boy is
hiding himself in your house. I must have him
back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With eyes dilated and distorted mouth, the
old man leaned forward and exclaimed: &lsquo;Your
boy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, my boy Gokul. He is Nitai Pal now,
and I myself go by the name of Damodar Pal.
Your <em>fame</em> has spread so widely in the neighbourhood,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
that we were obliged to cover up our origin,
lest people should have refused to pronounce our
names.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the old man lifted both his arms above
his head. His fingers began to twitch convulsively,
as though he was trying to catch hold of some
imaginary object in the air. He then fell on the
ground.</p>

<p>When he came to his senses again, he dragged
his son towards the ruined temple. When they
were both inside it, he said: &lsquo;Do you hear any
wailing sound?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I don't,&rsquo; said Brindaban.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just listen very carefully. Do you hear anybody
calling out &ldquo;Father&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This seemed to relieve him greatly.</p>

<p>From that day forward, he used to go about
asking people: &lsquo;Do you hear any wailing sound?&rsquo;
They laughed at the raving dotard.</p>

<p>About four years later, Jaganath lay on his
death-bed. When the light of this world was
gradually fading away from his eyes, and his
breathing became more and more difficult, he
suddenly sat up in a state of delirium. Throwing
both his hands in the air he seemed to grope about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
for something, muttering: &lsquo;Nitai, who has removed
my ladder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Unable to find the ladder to climb out of his
terrible dungeon, where there was no light to see
and no air to breathe, he fell on his bed once
more, and disappeared into that region where no
one has ever been found out in the world's eternal
game of hide-and-seek.<a name="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105&ndash;106"> </a>THE RIDDLE SOLVED</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>THE RIDDLE SOLVED</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Krishna Gopal Sircar</span>, zemindar of Jhikrakota,
made over his estates to his eldest son, and retired
to Kasi, as befits a good Hindu, to spend the
evening of his life in religious devotion. All the
poor and the destitute of the neighbourhood were
in tears at the parting. Every one declared that
such piety and benevolence were rare in these
degenerate days.</p>

<p>His son, Bipin Bihari, was a young man well
educated after the modern fashion, and had taken
the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He sported a
pair of spectacles, wore a beard, and seldom mixed
with others. His private life was unsullied. He
did not smoke, and never touched cards. He
was a man of stern disposition, though he looked
soft and pliable. This trait of his character soon
came home to his tenantry in diverse ways. Unlike
his father, he would on no account allow the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
remission of one single pice out of the rents justly
due to him. In no circumstances would he grant
any tenant one single day's grace in paying up.</p>

<p>On taking over the management of the property,
Bipin Bihari discovered that his father had
allowed a large number of Brahmins to hold land
entirely rent-free, and a larger number at rents
much below the prevailing rates. His father was
incapable of resisting the importunate solicitation
of others&mdash;such was the weakness of his character.</p>

<p>Bipin Bihari said this could never be. He
could not abandon the income of half his property&mdash;and
he reasoned with himself thus: <em>Firstly</em>, the
persons who were in actual enjoyment of the concessions
and getting fat at his expense were a lot
of worthless people, and wholly undeserving of
charity. Charity bestowed on such objects only
encouraged idleness. <em>Secondly</em>, living nowadays
had become much costlier than in the days of his
ancestors. Wants had increased apace. For a
gentleman to keep up his position had become
four times as expensive as in days past. So he
could not afford to scatter gifts right and left as
his father had done. On the contrary, it was his
bounden duty to call back as many of them as he
possibly could.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>So Bipin Bihari lost no time in carrying into
effect what he conceived to be his duty. He was
a man of strict principles.</p>

<p>What had gone out of his grasp, returned to
him little by little. Only a very small portion of
his father's grants did he allow to remain undisturbed,
and he took good care to arrange that
even those should not be deemed permanent.</p>

<p>The wails of the tenants reached Krishna Gopal
at Benares through the post. Some even made a
journey to that place to represent their grievances
to him in person. Krishna Gopal wrote to his
son intimating his displeasure. Bipin Bihari replied,
pointing out that the times had changed. In
former days, he said, the <i>zemindar</i> was compensated
for the gifts he made by the many customary
presents he received from his tenantry. Recent
statutes had made all such impositions illegal.
The <i>zemindar</i> had now to rest content with just
the stipulated rent, and nothing more. &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo;
he continued, &lsquo;we keep a strict watch over the
payment of our just dues, what will be left to us?
Since the tenants won't give us anything extra
now, how can we allow them concessions? Our
relations must henceforth be strictly commercial.
We shall be ruined if we go on making gifts and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
endowments, and the preservation of our property
and the keeping up of our position will be rendered
very difficult.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Krishna Gopal became uneasy at finding that
times should have changed so much. &lsquo;Well,
well,&rsquo; he murmured to himself, &lsquo;the younger
generation knows best, I suppose. Our old-fashioned
methods won't do now. If I interfere,
my son might refuse to manage the property, and
insist on my going back. No, thank you&mdash;I would
rather not. I prefer to devote the few days that
are left me to the service of my God.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>So things went on. Bipin Bihari put his affairs
in order after much litigation in the Courts, and
by less constitutional methods outside. Most
of the tenants submitted to his will out of fear.
Only a fellow called Asimuddin, son of Mirza
Bibi, remained refractory.</p>

<p>Bipin's displeasure was keenest against this
man. He could quite understand his father having
granted rent-free lands to Brahmins, but why this
Mohammedan should be holding so much land,
some free and some at rents lower than the prevailing
rates, was a riddle to him. And what
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
was he? The son of a low Mohammedan widow,
giving himself airs and defying the whole world,
simply because he had learnt to read and write a
little at the village school. To Bipin it was intolerable.</p>

<p>He made inquiries of his clerks about Asimuddin's
holdings. All that they could tell him was
that Babu Krishna Gopal himself had made these
grants to the family many years back, but they
had no idea as to what his motive might have
been. They imagined, however, that perhaps the
widow won the compassion of the kind-hearted
<i>zemindar</i>, by representing to him her woe and
misery.</p>

<p>To Bipin these favours seemed to be utterly
undeserved. He had not seen the pitiable condition
of these people in days gone by. Their
comparative ease at the present day and their
arrogance drove him to the conclusion that they
had impudently swindled his tender-hearted father
out of a part of his lawful income.</p>

<p>Asimuddin was a stiff-necked sort of a fellow,
too. He vowed that he would lay down his life
sooner than give up an inch of his land. Then
came open hostilities.</p>

<p>The poor old widow tried her best to pacify
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
her son. &lsquo;It is no good fighting with the <i>zemindar</i>,&rsquo;
she would often say to him. &lsquo;His kindness has
kept us alive so long; let us depend upon him
still, though he may curtail his favours. Surrender
to him part of the lands as he desires.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, mother!&rsquo; protested Asimuddin. &lsquo;What
do you know of these matters, pray?&rsquo;</p>

<p>One by one, Asimuddin lost the cases instituted
against him. The more he lost, the more his
obstinacy increased. For the sake of his all, he
staked all that was his.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Mirza Bibi collected some fruits
and vegetables from her little garden, and unknown
to her son went and sought an interview
with Bipin Babu. She looked at him with a
tenderness maternal in its intensity, and spoke:
&lsquo;May Allah bless you, my son. Do not destroy
Asim&mdash;it wouldn't be right of you. To your
charge I commit him. Take him as though he
were one whom it is your duty to support&mdash;as
though he were a ne'er-do-well younger brother
of yours. Vast is your wealth&mdash;don't grudge him
a small particle of it, my son.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This assumption of familiarity on the part of
the garrulous old woman annoyed Bipin not a
little. &lsquo;What do you know of these things, my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
good woman?&rsquo; he condescended to say. &lsquo;If you
have any representations to make, send your son
to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Being assured for the second time that she
knew nothing about these affairs, Mirza Bibi
returned home, wiping her eyes with her apron all
the way, and offering her silent prayers to Allah.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The litigation dragged its weary length from the
Criminal to the Civil Courts, and thence to the
High Court, where at last Asimuddin met with a
partial success. Eighteen months passed in this
way. But he was a ruined man now&mdash;plunged in
debts up to his very ears. His creditors took this
opportunity to execute the decrees they had obtained
against him. A date was fixed for putting
up to auction every stick and stone that he had left.</p>

<p>It was Monday. The village market had
assembled by the side of a tiny river, now swollen
by the rains. Buying and selling were going on,
partly on the bank and partly in the boats moored
there. The hubbub was great. Among the commodities
for sale jack-fruits preponderated, it
being the month of <i>Asadh</i>. <i>Hilsa</i> fish were seen
in large quantities also. The sky was cloudy.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
Many of the stall-holders, apprehending a downpour,
had stretched a piece of cloth overhead,
across bamboo poles put up for the purpose.</p>

<p>Asimuddin had come too&mdash;but he had not a
copper with him. No shopkeepers allowed him
credit nowadays. He therefore had brought a
brass <i>thali</i><a name="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and a <i>dao</i><a name="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> with him. These he would
pawn, and then buy what he needed.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Bipin Babu was out for a
walk attended by two or three retainers armed
with <i>lathis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Attracted by the noise, he directed
his steps towards the market. On his arrival, he
stopped awhile before the stall of Dwari, the oilman,
and made kindly inquiries about his business.
All on a sudden, Asimuddin raised his <i>dao</i> and ran
towards Bipin Babu, roaring like a tiger. The
market people caught hold of him half-way, and
quickly disarmed him. He was forthwith given
in custody to the police. Business in the market
then went on as usual.</p>

<p>We cannot say that Bipin Babu was not inwardly
pleased at this incident. It is intolerable
that the creature we are hunting down should turn
and show fight. &lsquo;The <i>badmash</i>,&rsquo; Bipin chuckled;
&lsquo;I have got him at last.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>The ladies of Bipin Babu's house, when they
heard the news, exclaimed with horror: &lsquo;Oh, the
ruffian! What a mercy they seized him in time!&rsquo;
They found consolation in the prospect of the man
being punished as he richly deserved.</p>

<p>In another part of the village the same evening
the widow's humble cottage, devoid of bread and
bereft of her son, became darker than death.
Others dismissed the incident of the afternoon
from their minds, sat down to their meals, retired
to bed and went to sleep, but to the widow the
event loomed larger than anything else in this wide
world. But, alas, who was there to combat it?
Only a bundle of wearied bones and a helpless
mother's heart trembling with fear.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Three days have passed in the meanwhile. To-morrow
the case would come up for trial before a
Deputy Magistrate. Bipin Babu would have to
be examined as a witness. Never before this did a
<i>zemindar</i> of Jhikrakota appear in the witness-box,
but Bipin did not mind.</p>

<p>The next day at the appointed hour, Bipin Babu
arrived at the Court in a palanquin in great state.
He wore a turban on his head, and a watch-chain
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
dangled on his breast. The Deputy Magistrate
invited him to a seat on the daïs, beside his own.
The Court-room was crowded to suffocation. So
great a sensation had not been witnessed in this
Court for many years.</p>

<p>When the time for the case to be called drew
near, a <i>chaprassi</i> came and whispered something in
Bipin Babu's ear. He got up very agitated and
walked out, begging the Deputy Magistrate to
excuse him for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Outside he saw his old father a little way off,
standing under a <i>banian</i> tree, barefooted and
wrapped in a piece of <i>namabali</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A string of
beads was in his hand. His slender form shone
with a gentle lustre, and tranquil compassion
seemed to radiate from his forehead.</p>

<p>Bipin, hampered by his close-fitting trousers
and his flowing <i>chapkan</i>, touched his father's feet
with his forehead. As he did this his turban came
off and kissed his nose, and his watch, popping out
of his pocket, swung to and fro in the air. Bipin
hurriedly straightened his turban, and begged his
father to come to his pleader's house close by.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; Krishna Gopal replied, &lsquo;I will
tell you here what I have got to say.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>A curious crowd had gathered by this time.
Bipin's attendants pushed them back.</p>

<p>Then Krishna Gopal said: &lsquo;You must do what
you can to get Asim acquitted, and restore him the
lands that you have taken away from him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it for this, father,&rsquo; said Bipin, very much
surprised, &lsquo;that you have come all the way from
Benares? Would you tell me why you have made
these people the objects of your special favour?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What would you gain by knowing it, my boy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Bipin persisted. &lsquo;It is only this, father,&rsquo;
he went on; &lsquo;I have revoked many a grant because
I thought the tenants were not deserving. There
were many Brahmins among them, but of them you
never said a word. Why are you so keen about these
Mohammedans now? After all that has happened,
if I drop this case against Asim, and give him
back his lands, what shall I say to people?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Krishna Gopal kept silence for some moments.
Then, passing the beads through his shaky fingers
with rapidity, he spoke with a tremulous voice:
&lsquo;Should it be necessary to explain your conduct to
people, you may tell them that Asimuddin is my
son&mdash;and your brother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; exclaimed Bipin in painful surprise.
&lsquo;From a Musalman's womb?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>&lsquo;Even so, my son,&rsquo; was the calm reply.</p>

<p>Bipin stood there for some time in mute astonishment.
Then he found words to say: &lsquo;Come
home, father; we will talk about it afterwards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, my son,&rsquo; replied the old man, &lsquo;having
once relinquished the world to serve my God, I
cannot go home again. I return hence. Now I
leave you to do what your sense of duty may
suggest.&rsquo; He then blessed his son, and, checking
his tears with difficulty, walked off with tottering
steps.</p>

<p>Bipin was dumbfounded, not knowing what to
say nor what to do. &lsquo;So, such was the piety of
the older generation,&rsquo; he said to himself. He reflected
with pride how much better he was than his
father in point of education and morality. This
was the result, he concluded, of not having a
principle to guide one's actions.</p>

<p>Returning to the Court, he saw Asimuddin
outside between two constables, awaiting his trial.
He looked emaciated and worn out. His lips
were pale and dry, and his eyes unnaturally bright.
A dirty piece of cloth worn to shreds covered him.
&lsquo;This my brother!&rsquo; Bipin shuddered at the
thought.</p>

<p>The Deputy Magistrate and Bipin were friends,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119&ndash;120"> </a>
and the case ended in a fiasco. In a few days
Asimuddin was restored to his former condition.
Why all this happened, he could not understand.
The village people were greatly surprised also.</p>

<p>However, the news of Krishna Gopal's arrival
just before the trial soon got abroad. People
began to exchange meaning glances. The pleaders
in their shrewdness guessed the whole affair. One
of them, Ram Taran Babu, was beholden to Krishna
Gopal for his education and his start in life. Somehow
or other he had always suspected that the
virtue and piety of his benefactor were shams. Now
he was fully convinced that, if a searching inquiry
were made, all &lsquo;pious&rsquo; men might be found out.
&lsquo;Let them tell their beads as much as they like,&rsquo; he
thought with glee, &lsquo;everybody in this world is just
as bad as myself. The only difference between
a good and a bad man is that the good practise
dissimulation while the bad don't.&rsquo; The revelation
that Krishna Gopal's far-famed piety, benevolence,
and magnanimity were nothing but a cloak of
hypocrisy, settled a difficulty that had oppressed
Ram Taran Babu for many years. By what process
of reasoning, we do not know, the burden of
gratitude was greatly lifted off his mind. It was
a vast relief to him!</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>THE ELDER SISTER</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Having</span> described at length the misdeeds of an
unfortunate woman's wicked, tyrannical husband,
Tara, the woman's neighbour in the village, very
shortly declared her verdict: &lsquo;Fire be to such a
husband's mouth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this Joygopal Babu's wife felt much hurt;
it did not become womankind to wish, in any
circumstances whatever, a worse species of fire
than that of a cigar in a husband's mouth.</p>

<p>When, therefore, she mildly disapproved the
verdict, hard-hearted Tara cried with redoubled
vehemence: &lsquo;'Twere better to be a widow seven
births over than the wife of such a husband,&rsquo;
and saying this she broke up the meeting and
left.</p>

<p>Sasi said within herself: &lsquo;I can't imagine any
offence in a husband that could so harden the
heart against him.&rsquo; Even as she turned the matter
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
over in her mind, all the tenderness of her loving
soul gushed forth towards her own husband now
abroad. Throwing herself with outstretched arms
on that part of the bed whereon her husband
was wont to lie, she kissed the empty pillow,
caught the smell of her husband's head, and, shutting
the door, brought out from a wooden box an
old and almost faded photograph with some letters
in his handwriting, and sat gazing upon them.
Thus she passed the hushed noontide alone in
her room, musing of old memories and shedding
tears of sadness.</p>

<p>It was no new yoke this between Sasikala and
Joygopal. They had been married at an early
age and had children. Their long companionship
had made the days go by in an easy, commonplace
sort of way. On neither side had there been any
symptoms of excessive passion. They had lived
together nearly sixteen years without a break,
when her husband was suddenly called away from
home on business, and then a great impulse of
love awoke in Sasi's soul. As separation strained
the tie, love's knot grew tighter, and the passion,
whose existence Sasi had not felt, now made her
throb with pain.</p>

<p>So it happened that after so many long years,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
and at such an age, and being the mother of
children, Sasi, on this spring noon, in her lonely
chamber, lying on the bed of separation, began to
dream the sweet dream of a bride in her budding
youth. That love of which hitherto she had been
unconscious suddenly aroused her with its murmuring
music. She wandered a long way up the stream,
and saw many a golden mansion and many a grove
on either bank; but no foothold could she find now
amid the vanished hopes of happiness. She began
to say to herself that, when next she met her
husband, life should not be insipid nor should the
spring come in vain. How very often, in idle
disputation or some petty quarrel, had she teased
her husband! With all the singleness of a penitent
heart she vowed that she would never show
impatience again, never oppose her husband's
wishes, bear all his commands, and with a tender
heart submit to whatever he wished of good or
ill; for the husband was all-in-all, the husband
was the dearest object of love, the husband was
divine.</p>

<p>Sasikala was the only and much-petted daughter
of her parents. For this reason, though he had
only a small property of his own, Joygopal had
no anxieties about the future. His father-in-law
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
had enough to support them in a village with
royal state.</p>

<p>And then in his old age a son was born untimely
to Sasikala's father. To tell the truth,
Sasi was very sore in her mind at this unlooked-for,
improper, and unjust action of her parents;
nor was Joygopal particularly pleased.</p>

<p>The parents' love centred in this son of their
advanced years, and when the newly arrived,
diminutive, sleepy brother-in-law seized with his
two weak tiny fists all the hopes and expectations
of Joygopal, Joygopal found a place in a tea-garden
in Assam.</p>

<p>His friends urged him to look for employment
hard-by, but whether out of a general feeling of
resentment, or knowing the chances of rapid rise in
a tea-garden, Joygopal would not pay heed to anybody.
He sent his wife and children to his father-in-law's,
and left for Assam. It was the first separation
between husband and wife in their married life.</p>

<p>This incident made Sasikala very angry with
her baby brother. The soreness which may not
pass the lips is felt the more keenly within.
When the little fellow sucked and slept at his
ease, his big sister found a hundred reasons, such
as the rice is cold, the boys are too late for school,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
to worry herself and others, day and night, with
her petulant humours.</p>

<p>But in a short time the child's mother died.
Before her death, she committed her infant son to
her daughter's care.</p>

<p>Then did the motherless child easily conquer
his sister's heart. With loud whoops he would
fling himself upon her, and with right good-will
try to get her mouth, nose, eyes within his own
tiny mouth; he would seize her hair within his
little fists and refuse to give it up; awaking before
the dawn, he would roll over to her side and thrill
her with his soft touch, and babble like a noisy
brook; later on, he would call her <i>jiji</i> and <i>jijima</i>,
and in hours of work and rest, by doing forbidden
things, eating forbidden food, going to forbidden
places, would set up a regular tyranny over her;
then Sasi could resist no longer. She surrendered
herself completely to this wayward little tyrant.
Since the child had no mother, his influence over
her became the greater.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The child was named Nilmani. When he was
two years old his father fell seriously ill. A letter
reached Joygopal asking him to come as quickly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
as possible. When after much trouble he got
leave and arrived, Kaliprasanna's last hour had
come.</p>

<p>Before he died Kaliprasanna entrusted Joygopal
with the charge of his son, and left a quarter of
his estate to his daughter.</p>

<p>So Joygopal gave up his appointment, and
came home to look after his property.</p>

<p>After a long time husband and wife met again.
When a material body breaks it may be put together
again. But when two human beings are
divided, after a long separation, they never re-unite
at the same place, and to the same time; for the
mind is a living thing, and moment by moment it
grows and changes.</p>

<p>In Sasi reunion stirred a new emotion. The
numbness of age-long habit in their old marriage
was entirely removed by the longing born of
separation, and she seemed to win her husband
much more closely than before. Had she not
vowed in her mind that whatever days might
come, and how long soever they might be, she
would never let the brightness of this glowing
love for her husband be dimmed.</p>

<p>Of this reunion, however, Joygopal felt differently.
When they were constantly together
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
before he had been bound to his wife by his
interests and idiosyncrasies. His wife was then
a living truth in his life, and there would have been
a great rent in the web of his daily habit if she
were left out. Consequently Joygopal found
himself in deep waters at first when he went
abroad. But in time this breach in habit was
patched up by a new habit.</p>

<p>And this was not all. Formerly his days went
by in the most indolent and careless fashion. For
the last two years, the stimulus of bettering his
condition had stirred so powerfully in his breast
that he had nothing else in his thoughts. As
compared with the intensity of this new passion,
his old life seemed like an unsubstantial shadow.
The greatest changes in a woman's nature are
wrought by love; in a man's, by ambition.</p>

<p>Joygopal, when he returned after two years,
found his wife not quite the same as of old. To
her life his infant brother-in-law had added a new
breadth. This part of her life was wholly unfamiliar
to him&mdash;here he had no communion with his wife.
His wife tried hard to share her love for the child
with him, but it cannot be said that she succeeded.
Sasi would come with the child in her arms, and
hold him before her husband with a smiling face&mdash;Nilmani
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
would clasp Sasi's neck, and hide his
face on her shoulder, and admit no obligation
of kindred. Sasi wished that her little brother
might show Joygopal all the arts he had learnt to
capture a man's mind. But Joygopal was not
very keen about it. How could the child show
any enthusiasm? Joygopal could not at all
understand what there was in the heavy-pated,
grave-faced, dusky child that so much love should
be wasted on him.</p>

<p>Women quickly understand the ways of love.
Sasi at once understood that Joygopal did not
care for Nilmani. Henceforth she used to screen
her brother with the greatest care&mdash;to keep him
away from the unloving, repelling look of her
husband. Thus the child came to be the treasure
of her secret care, the object of her isolated love.</p>

<p>Joygopal was greatly annoyed when Nilmani
cried; so Sasi would quickly press the child to
her breast, and with her whole heart and soul try
to soothe him. And when Nilmani's cry happened
to disturb Joygopal's sleep at night, and Joygopal
with an expression of displeasure, and in a tortured
spirit, growled at the child, Sasi felt humbled and
fluttered like a guilty thing. Then she would
take up the child in her lap, retire to a distance,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
and in a voice of pleading love, with such endearments
as &lsquo;my gold, my treasure, my jewel,&rsquo; lull
him to sleep.</p>

<p>Children will fall out for a hundred things.
Formerly in such cases, Sasi would punish her
children, and side with her brother, for he was
motherless. Now the law changed with the judge.
Nilmani had often to bear heavy punishment
without fault and without inquiry. This wrong
went like a dagger to Sasi's heart; so she would
take her punished brother into her room, and
with sweets and toys, and by caressing and
kissing him, solace as much as she could his
stricken heart.</p>

<p>Thus the more Sasi loved Nilmani, the more
Joygopal was annoyed with him. On the other
hand, the more Joygopal showed his contempt
for Nilmani, the more would Sasi bathe the child
with the nectar of her love.</p>

<p>And when the fellow Joygopal behaved harshly
to his wife, Sasi would minister to him silently,
meekly, and with loving-kindness. But inwardly
they hurt each other, moment by moment, about
Nilmani.</p>

<p>The hidden clash of a silent conflict like this is
far harder to bear than an open quarrel.</p>

<div><a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a></div>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>Nilmani's head was the largest part of him.
It seemed as if the Creator had blown through
a slender stick a big bubble at its top. The
doctors feared sometimes that the child might be
as frail and as quickly evanescent as a bubble.
For a long time he could neither speak nor walk.
Looking at his sad grave face, you might think
that his parents had unburdened all the sad weight
of their advanced years upon the head of this
little child.</p>

<p>With his sister's care and nursing, Nilmani
passed the period of danger, and arrived at his
sixth year.</p>

<p>In the month of Kartik, on the <i>bhaiphoto</i><a name="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> day,
Sasi had dressed Nilmani up as a little Babu, in
coat and <i>chadar</i> and red-bordered <i>dhoti</i>, and was
giving him the &lsquo;brother's mark,&rsquo; when her outspoken
neighbour Tara came in and, for one
reason or another, began a quarrel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;'Tis no use,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;giving the &ldquo;brother's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>
mark&rdquo; with so much show and ruining the
brother in secret.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this Sasi was thunderstruck with astonishment,
rage, and pain. Tara repeated the rumour
that Sasi and her husband had conspired together
to put the minor Nilmani's property up for sale
for arrears of rent, and to purchase it in the name
of her husband's cousin. When Sasi heard this,
she uttered a curse that those who could spread
such a foul lie might be stricken with leprosy in
the mouth. And then she went weeping to her
husband, and told him of the gossip. Joygopal
said: &lsquo;Nobody can be trusted in these days.
Upen is my aunt's son, and I felt quite safe in
leaving him in charge of the property. He could
not have allowed the <i>taluk</i> Hasilpur to fall into
arrears and purchase it himself in secret, if I had
had the least inkling about it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Won't you sue then?&rsquo; asked Sasi in astonishment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sue one's cousin!&rsquo; said Joygopal. &lsquo;Besides,
it would be useless, a simple waste of money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was Sasi's supreme duty to trust her husband's
word, but Sasi could not. At last her happy
home, the domesticity of her love seemed hateful
to her. That home life which had once seemed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
her supreme refuge was nothing more than a cruel
snare of self-interest, which had surrounded them,
brother and sister, on all sides. She was a
woman, single-handed, and she knew not how
she could save the helpless Nilmani. The more
she thought, the more her heart filled with terror,
loathing, and an infinite love for her imperilled
little brother. She thought that, if she only knew
how, she would appear before the <i>Lat Saheb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> nay,
write to the Maharani herself, to save her brother's
property. The Maharani would surely not allow
Nilmani's <i>taluk</i><a name="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of Hasilpur, with an income of
seven hundred and fifty-eight rupees a year, to be
sold.</p>

<p>When Sasi was thus thinking of bringing her
husband's cousin to book by appealing to the
Maharani herself, Nilmani was suddenly seized
with fever and convulsions.</p>

<p>Joygopal called in the village doctor. When
Sasi asked for a better doctor, Joygopal said:
&lsquo;Why, Matilal isn't a bad sort.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sasi fell at his feet, and charged him with an
oath on her own head; whereupon Joygopal said:
&lsquo;Well, I shall send for the doctor from town.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sasi lay with Nilmani in her lap, nor would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
Nilmani let her out of his sight for a minute; he
clung to her lest by some pretence she should
escape; even while he slept he would not loosen
his hold of her dress.</p>

<p>Thus the whole day passed, and Joygopal
came after nightfall to say that the doctor was
not at home; he had gone to see a patient at a
distance. He added that he himself had to leave
that very day on account of a lawsuit, and that he
had told Matilal, who would regularly call to see
the patient.</p>

<p>At night Nilmani wandered in his sleep. As
soon as the morning dawned, Sasi, without the
least scruple, took a boat with her sick brother,
and went straight to the doctor's house. The
doctor was at home&mdash;he had not left the town.
He quickly found lodgings for her, and having
installed her under the care of an elderly widow,
undertook the treatment of the boy.</p>

<p>The next day Joygopal arrived. Blazing with
fury, he ordered his wife to return home with him
at once.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even if you cut me to pieces, I won't return,&rsquo;
replied his wife. &lsquo;You all want to kill my Nilmani,
who has no father, no mother, none other than me,
but I will save him.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>&lsquo;Then you remain here, and don't come back
to my house,&rsquo; cried Joygopal indignantly.</p>

<p>Sasi at length fired up. &lsquo;<em>Your</em> house! Why,
'tis my brother's!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, we'll see,&rsquo; said Joygopal. The
neighbours made a great stir over this incident.
&lsquo;If you want to quarrel with your husband,&rsquo; said
Tara, &lsquo;do so at home. What is the good of leaving
your house? After all, Joygopal is your husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By spending all the money she had with her,
and selling her ornaments, Sasi saved her brother
from the jaws of death. Then she heard that the
big property which they had in Dwarigram, where
their dwelling-house stood, the income of which
was more than Rs. 1500 a year, had been transferred
by Joygopal into his own name with the help of
the Jemindar. And now the whole property
belonged to them, not to her brother.</p>

<p>When he had recovered from his illness,
Nilmani would cry plaintively: &lsquo;Let us go home,
sister.&rsquo; His heart was pining for his nephews and
nieces, his companions. So he repeatedly said:
&lsquo;Let us go home, sister, to that old house of ours.&rsquo;
At this Sasi wept. Where was their home?</p>

<p>But it was no good crying. Her brother had
no one else besides herself in the world. Sasi
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
thought of this, wiped her tears, and, entering the
Zenana of the Deputy Magistrate, Tarini Babu,
appealed to his wife. The Deputy Magistrate
knew Joygopal. That a woman should forsake
her home, and engage in a dispute with her husband
regarding matters of property, greatly incensed
him against Sasi. However, Tarini Babu kept
Sasi diverted, and instantly wrote to Joygopal.
Joygopal put his wife and brother-in-law into a
boat by force, and brought them home.</p>

<p>Husband and wife, after a second separation,
met again for the second time! The decree of
Prajapati!<a name="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Having got back his old companions after a
long absence, Nilmani was perfectly happy. Seeing
his unsuspecting joy, Sasi felt as if her heart would
break.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The Magistrate was touring in the Mofussil during
the cold weather and pitched his tent within
the village to shoot. The Saheb met Nilmani
on the village <i>maidan</i>. The other boys gave him
a wide berth, varying Chanakya's couplet a little,
and adding the Saheb to the list of &lsquo;the clawed,
the toothed, and the horned beasts.&rsquo; But grave-natured
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
Nilmani in imperturbable curiosity serenely
gazed at the Saheb.</p>

<p>The Saheb was amused and came up and asked
in Bengali: &lsquo;You read at the <i>pathsala</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy silently nodded. &lsquo;What <i>pustaks</i><a name="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> do
you read?&rsquo; asked the Saheb.</p>

<p>As Nilmani did not understand the word <i>pustak</i>,
he silently fixed his gaze on the Magistrate's face.
Nilmani told his sister the story of his meeting
the Magistrate with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At noon, Joygopal, dressed in trousers, <i>chapkan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and <i>pagri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> went to pay his salams to the Saheb.
A crowd of suitors, <i>chaprasies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and constables
stood about him. Fearing the heat, the Saheb had
seated himself at a court-table outside the tent, in
the open shade, and placing Joygopal in a chair,
questioned him about the state of the village.
Having taken the seat of honour in open view of
the community, Joygopal swelled inwardly, and
thought it would be a good thing if any of the
Chakrabartis or Nandis came and saw him there.</p>

<p>At this moment, a woman, closely veiled, and
accompanied by Nilmani, came straight up to the
Magistrate. She said: &lsquo;Saheb, into your hands I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
resign my helpless brother. Save him.&rsquo; The
Saheb, seeing the large-headed, solemn boy, whose
acquaintance he had already made, and thinking
that the woman must be of a respectable family,
at once stood up and said: &lsquo;Please enter the tent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The woman said: &lsquo;What I have to say I will
say here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Joygopal writhed and turned pale. The curious
villagers thought it capital fun, and pressed closer.
But the moment the Saheb lifted his cane they
scampered off.</p>

<p>Holding her brother by the hand, Sasi narrated
the history of the orphan from the beginning. As
Joygopal tried to interrupt now and then, the
Magistrate thundered with a flushed face, &lsquo;<i>Chup
rao</i>,&rsquo; and with the tip of his cane motioned to
Joygopal to leave the chair and stand up.</p>

<p>Joygopal, inwardly raging against Sasi, stood
speechless. Nilmani nestled up close to his sister,
and listened awe-struck.</p>

<p>When Sasi had finished her story, the Magistrate
put a few questions to Joygopal, and on hearing
his answers, kept silence for a long while, and then
addressed Sasi thus: &lsquo;My good woman, though
this matter may not come up before me, still rest
assured I will do all that is needful about it. You
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
can return home with your brother without the
least misgiving.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sasi said: &lsquo;Saheb, so long as he does not get
back his own home, I dare not take him there.
Unless you keep Nilmani with you, none else will
be able to save him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what would you do?&rsquo; queried the Saheb.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will retire to my husband's house,&rsquo; said Sasi;
&lsquo;there is nothing to fear for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Saheb smiled a little, and, as there was
nothing else to do, agreed to take charge of this
lean, dusty, grave, sedate, gentle Bengali boy whose
neck was ringed with amulets.</p>

<p>When Sasi was about to take her leave, the boy
clutched her dress. &lsquo;Don't be frightened, <i>baba</i>,&mdash;come,&rsquo;
said the Saheb. With tears streaming
behind her veil, Sasi said: &lsquo;Do go, my brother,
my darling brother&mdash;you will meet your sister
again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Saying this she embraced him and stroked his
head and back, and releasing her dress, hastily
withdrew; and just then the Saheb put his left arm
round him. The child wailed out: &lsquo;Sister, oh, my
sister!&rsquo; Sasi turned round at once, and with outstretched
arm made a sign of speechless solace, and
with a bursting heart withdrew.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141&ndash;142"> </a>Again in that old, ever-familiar house husband
and wife met. The decree of Prajapati!</p>

<p>But this union did not last long. For soon
after the villagers learnt one morning that Sasi had
died of cholera in the night, and had been instantly
cremated.</p>

<p>None uttered a word about it. Only neighbour
Tara would sometimes be on the point of bursting
out, but people would shut up her mouth, saying,
&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At parting, Sasi gave her word to her brother
they would meet again. Where that word was
kept none can tell.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>SUBHA</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">When</span> the girl was given the name of Subhashini,<a name="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
who could have guessed that she would prove
dumb? Her two elder sisters were Sukeshini<a name="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and
Suhasini,<a name="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and for the sake of uniformity her
father named his youngest girl Subhashini. She
was called Subha for short.</p>

<p>Her two elder sisters had been married with
the usual cost and difficulty, and now the youngest
daughter lay like a silent weight upon the heart of
her parents. All the world seemed to think that,
because she did not speak, therefore she did not feel;
it discussed her future and its own anxiety freely in
her presence. She had understood from her earliest
childhood that God had sent her like a curse to her
father's house, so she withdrew herself from ordinary
people, and tried to live apart. If only they would
all forget her she felt she could endure it. But
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
who can forget pain? Night and day her parents'
minds were aching on her account. Especially
her mother looked upon her as a deformity in
herself. To a mother a daughter is a more closely
intimate part of herself than a son can be; and a
fault in her is a source of personal shame. Banikantha,
Subha's father, loved her rather better
than his other daughters; her mother regarded
her with aversion as a stain upon her own body.</p>

<p>If Subha lacked speech, she did not lack a pair
of large dark eyes, shaded with long lashes; and
her lips trembled like a leaf in response to any
thought that rose in her mind.</p>

<p>When we express our thought in words, the
medium is not found easily. There must be a
process of translation, which is often inexact, and
then we fall into error. But black eyes need no
translating; the mind itself throws a shadow upon
them. In them thought opens or shuts, shines
forth, or goes out in darkness, hangs steadfast like
the setting moon, or, like the swift and restless
lightning, illumines all quarters of the sky. They
who from birth have had no other speech than
the trembling of their lips learn a language of the
eyes, endless in expression, deep as the sea, clear as
the heavens, wherein play dawn and sunset, light
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
and shadow. The dumb have a lonely grandeur
like Nature's own. Wherefore the other children
almost dreaded Subha, and never played with her.
She was silent and companionless as noontide.</p>

<p>The hamlet where she lived was Chandipur. Its
river, small for a river of Bengal, kept to its narrow
bounds like a daughter of the middle class. This
busy streak of water never overflowed its banks, but
went about its duties as though it were a member
of every family in the villages beside it. On either
side were houses and banks shaded with trees.
So stepping from her queenly throne, the river-goddess
became a garden deity of each home;
and forgetful of herself, performed her task of
endless benediction with swift and cheerful foot.</p>

<p>Banikantha's house looked upon the stream.
Every hut and stack in the place could be seen by
the passing boatmen. I know not if amid these
signs of worldly wealth any one noticed the little
girl who, when her work was done, stole away to
the waterside, and sat there. But here Nature
fulfilled her want of speech, and spoke for her.
The murmur of the brook, the voice of the village
folk, the songs of the boatmen, the crying of the
birds and rustle of trees mingled, and were one
with the trembling of her heart. They became
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
one vast wave of sound, which beat upon her restless
soul. This murmur and movement of Nature
were the dumb girl's language; that speech of
the dark eyes, which the long lashes shaded, was
the language of the world about her. From the
trees, where the cicalas chirped, to the quiet stars
there was nothing but signs and gestures, weeping
and sighing. And in the deep mid-noon, when
the boatmen and fisherfolk had gone to their
dinner, when the villagers slept, and birds were
still, when the ferry-boats were idle, when the great
busy world paused in its toil, and became suddenly
a lonely, awful giant, then beneath the vast impressive
heavens there were only dumb Nature
and a dumb girl, sitting very silent&mdash;one under
the spreading sunlight, the other where a small
tree cast its shadow.</p>

<p>But Subha was not altogether without friends.
In the stall were two cows, Sarbbashi and Panguli.
They had never heard their names from her lips,
but they knew her footfall. Though she had no
words, she murmured lovingly and they understood
her gentle murmuring better than all speech.
When she fondled them or scolded or coaxed them,
they understood her better than men could do.
Subha would come to the shed, and throw her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>
arms round Sarbbashi's neck; she would rub her
cheek against her friend's, and Panguli would turn
her great kind eyes and lick her face. The girl
paid them three regular visits every day, and
others that were irregular. Whenever she heard
any words that hurt her, she would come to these
dumb friends out of due time. It was as though
they guessed her anguish of spirit from her quiet
look of sadness. Coming close to her, they
would rub their horns softly against her arms,
and in dumb, puzzled fashion try to comfort
her. Besides these two, there were goats and a
kitten; but Subha had not the same equality of
friendship with them, though they showed the
same attachment. Every time it got a chance,
night or day, the kitten would jump into her lap,
and settle down to slumber, and show its appreciation
of an aid to sleep as Subha drew her soft
fingers over its neck and back.</p>

<p>Subha had a comrade also among the higher
animals, and it is hard to say what were the girl's
relations with him, for he could speak, and his
gift of speech left them without any common
language. He was the youngest boy of the
Gosains, Pratap by name, an idle fellow. After
long effort, his parents had abandoned the hope
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
that he would ever make his living. Now losels
have this advantage, that, though their own folk
disapprove of them, they are generally popular
with every one else. Having no work to chain
them, they become public property. Just as every
town needs an open space where all may breathe,
so a village needs two or three gentlemen of
leisure, who can give time to all; so that, if we
are lazy and want a companion, one is to hand.</p>

<p>Pratap's chief ambition was to catch fish. He
managed to waste a lot of time this way, and
might be seen almost any afternoon so employed.
It was thus most often that he met Subha. Whatever
he was about, he liked a companion; and,
when one is catching fish, a silent companion is
best of all. Pratap respected Subha for her taciturnity,
and, as every one called her Subha, he
showed his affection by calling her Su. Subha
used to sit beneath a tamarind, and Pratap, a little
distance off, would cast his line. Pratap took
with him a small allowance of betel, and Subha
prepared it for him. And I think that, sitting and
gazing a long while, she desired ardently to bring
some great help to Pratap, to be of real aid, to
prove by any means that she was not a useless
burden to the world. But there was nothing to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
do. Then she turned to the Creator in prayer
for some rare power, that by an astonishing
miracle she might startle Pratap into exclaiming:
&lsquo;My! I never dreamt our Su could have done
this!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Only think! if Subha had been a water nymph,
she might have risen slowly from the river, bringing
the gem of a snake's crown to the landing-place.
Then Pratap, leaving his paltry fishing,
might dive into the lower world, and see there, on
a golden bed in a palace of silver, whom else but
dumb little Su, Banikantha's child? Yes, our Su,
the only daughter of the king of that shining city
of jewels! But that might not be, it was impossible.
Not that anything is really impossible, but
Su had been born, not into the royal house of
Patalpur,<a name="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but into Banikantha's family, and she
knew no means of astonishing the Gosains' boy.</p>

<p>Gradually she grew up. Gradually she began
to find herself. A new inexpressible consciousness
like a tide from the central places of the sea, when
the moon is full, swept through her. She saw
herself, questioned herself, but no answer came
that she could understand.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, late on a night of full moon,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
she slowly opened her door, and peeped out timidly.
Nature, herself at full moon, like lonely Subha,
was looking down on the sleeping earth. Her
strong young life beat within her; joy and sadness
filled her being to its brim; she reached the
limits even of her own illimitable loneliness, nay,
passed beyond them. Her heart was heavy, and she
could not speak! At the skirts of this silent,
troubled Mother there stood a silent troubled
girl.</p>

<p>The thought of her marriage filled her parents
with an anxious care. People blamed them, and
even talked of making them outcasts. Banikantha
was well off; they had fish-curry twice daily; and
consequently he did not lack enemies. Then the
women interfered, and Bani went away for a few
days. Presently he returned, and said: &lsquo;We
must go to Calcutta.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They got ready to go to this strange country.
Subha's heart was heavy with tears, like a mist-wrapt
dawn. With a vague fear that had been
gathering for days, she dogged her father and
mother like a dumb animal. With her large eyes
wide open, she scanned their faces as though she
wished to learn something. But not a word did
they vouchsafe. One afternoon in the midst of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>
all this, as Pratap was fishing, he laughed: &lsquo;So then,
Su, they have caught your bridegroom, and you
are going to be married! Mind you don't forget
me altogether!&rsquo; Then he turned his mind again
to his fish. As a stricken doe looks in the hunter's
face, asking in silent agony: &lsquo;What have I done
to you?&rsquo; so Subha looked at Pratap. That day
she sat no longer beneath her tree. Banikantha,
having finished his nap, was smoking in his bedroom
when Subha dropped down at his feet and
burst out weeping as she gazed towards him.
Banikantha tried to comfort her, and his cheek
grew wet with tears.</p>

<p>It was settled that on the morrow they should
go to Calcutta. Subha went to the cow-shed to
bid farewell to her childhood's comrades. She fed
them with her hand; she clasped their necks; she
looked into their faces, and tears fell fast from
the eyes which spoke for her. That night was
the tenth of the moon. Subha left her room, and
flung herself down on her grassy couch beside her
dear river. It was as if she threw her arms about
Earth, her strong, silent mother, and tried to say:
&lsquo;Do not let me leave you, mother. Put your
arms about me, as I have put mine about you, and
hold me fast.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>One day in a house in Calcutta, Subha's mother
dressed her up with great care. She imprisoned
her hair, knotting it up in laces, she hung her
about with ornaments, and did her best to kill her
natural beauty, Subha's eyes filled with tears.
Her mother, fearing they would grow swollen with
weeping, scolded her harshly, but the tears disregarded
the scolding. The bridegroom came with
a friend to inspect the bride. Her parents were
dizzy with anxiety and fear when they saw the
god arrive to select the beast for his sacrifice.
Behind the stage, the mother called her instructions
aloud, and increased her daughter's
weeping twofold, before she sent her into the
examiner's presence. The great man, after scanning
her a long time, observed: &lsquo;Not so bad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He took special note of her tears, and thought
she must have a tender heart. He put it to her
credit in the account, arguing that the heart, which
to-day was distressed at leaving her parents, would
presently prove a useful possession. Like the
oyster's pearls, the child's tears only increased her
value, and he made no other comment.</p>

<p>The almanac was consulted, and the marriage
took place on an auspicious day. Having delivered
over their dumb girl into another's hands, Subha's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155&ndash;156"> </a>
parents returned home. Thank God! Their caste
in this and their safety in the next world were
assured! The bridegroom's work lay in the west,
and shortly after the marriage he took his wife
thither.</p>

<p>In less than ten days every one knew that the
bride was dumb! At least, if any one did not, it
was not her fault, for she deceived no one. Her
eyes told them everything, though no one understood
her. She looked on every hand; she found
no speech; she missed the faces, familiar from
birth, of those who had understood a dumb girl's
language. In her silent heart there sounded an
endless, voiceless weeping, which only the Searcher
of Hearts could hear.</p>

<p>Using both eyes and ears <em>this</em> time, her lord
made another careful examination, using his ears
this time as well as his eyes, and married a second
wife who could speak.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157&ndash;158"> </a>THE POSTMASTER</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>THE POSTMASTER</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">The</span> postmaster first took up his duties in the
village of Ulapur. Though the village was a
small one, there was an indigo factory near by, and
the proprietor, an Englishman, had managed to
get a post office established.</p>

<p>Our postmaster belonged to Calcutta. He felt
like a fish out of water in this remote village.
His office and living-room were in a dark thatched
shed, not far from a green, slimy pond, surrounded
on all sides by a dense growth.</p>

<p>The men employed in the indigo factory had
no leisure; moreover, they were hardly desirable
companions for decent folk. Nor is a Calcutta
boy an adept in the art of associating with others.
Among strangers he appears either proud or ill
at ease. At any rate, the postmaster had but
little company; nor had he much to do.</p>

<p>At times he tried his hand at writing a verse or
two. That the movement of the leaves and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
clouds of the sky were enough to fill life with joy&mdash;such
were the sentiments to which he sought
to give expression. But God knows that the
poor fellow would have felt it as the gift of a
new life, if some genie of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
had in one night swept away the trees, leaves
and all, and replaced them with a macadamised
road, hiding the clouds from view with rows of
tall houses.</p>

<p>The postmaster's salary was small. He had to
cook his own meals, which he used to share with
Ratan, an orphan girl of the village, who did odd
jobs for him.</p>

<p>When in the evening the smoke began to curl
up from the village cow-sheds,<a name="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the cicalas
chirped in every bush; when the faquirs of the
Baül sect sang their shrill songs in their daily
meeting-place, when any poet, who had attempted
to watch the movement of the leaves in the dense
bamboo thickets, would have felt a ghostly shiver
run down his back, the postmaster would light his
little lamp, and call out &lsquo;Ratan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ratan would sit outside waiting for this call,
and, instead of coming in at once, would reply:
&lsquo;Did you call me, sir?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; the postmaster would
ask.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must be going to light the kitchen fire,&rsquo;
would be the answer.</p>

<p>And the postmaster would say: &lsquo;Oh, let the
kitchen fire be for awhile; light me my pipe first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last Ratan would enter, with puffed-out
cheeks, vigorously blowing into a flame a live coal
to light the tobacco. This would give the postmaster
an opportunity of conversing. &lsquo;Well,
Ratan,&rsquo; perhaps he would begin, &lsquo;do you remember
anything of your mother?&rsquo; That was a fertile
subject. Ratan partly remembered, and partly
didn't. Her father had been fonder of her than
her mother; him she recollected more vividly.
He used to come home in the evening after
his work, and one or two evenings stood out
more clearly than others, like pictures in her
memory. Ratan would squat on the floor near
the postmaster's feet, as memories crowded in
upon her. She called to mind a little brother that
she had&mdash;and how on some bygone cloudy day
she had played at fishing with him on the edge of
the pond, with a twig for a make-believe fishing-rod.
Such little incidents would drive out greater
events from her mind. Thus, as they talked, it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>
would often get very late, and the postmaster
would feel too lazy to do any cooking at all.
Ratan would then hastily light the fire, and toast
some unleavened bread, which, with the cold
remnants of the morning meal, was enough for
their supper.</p>

<p>On some evenings, seated at his desk in the
corner of the big empty shed, the postmaster too
would call up memories of his own home, of his
mother and his sister, of those for whom in his
exile his heart was sad,&mdash;memories which were
always haunting him, but which he could not
talk about with the men of the factory, though he
found himself naturally recalling them aloud in the
presence of the simple little girl. And so it came
about that the girl would allude to his people as
mother, brother, and sister,<a name="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> as if she had known
them all her life. In fact, she had a complete
picture of each one of them painted in her little
heart.</p>

<p>One noon, during a break in the rains, there
was a cool soft breeze blowing; the smell of the
damp grass and leaves in the hot sun felt like the
warm breathing of the tired earth on one's body.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
A persistent bird went on all the afternoon repeating
the burden of its one complaint in Nature's
audience chamber.</p>

<p>The postmaster had nothing to do. The
shimmer of the freshly washed leaves, and the
banked-up remnants of the retreating rain-clouds
were sights to see; and the postmaster was watching
them, and thinking to himself: &lsquo;Oh, if only
some kindred soul were near&mdash;just one loving
human being whom I could hold near my heart!&rsquo;
This was exactly, he went on to think, what that
bird was trying to say, and it was the same feeling
which the murmuring leaves were striving
to express. But no one knows, or would believe,
that such an idea might also take possession of an
ill-paid village postmaster in the deep, silent mid-day
interval of his work.</p>

<p>The postmaster sighed, and called out &lsquo;Ratan.&rsquo;
Ratan was then sprawling beneath the guava-tree,
busily engaged in eating unripe guavas. At the
voice of her master, she ran up breathlessly, saying:
&lsquo;Were you calling me, Dada?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> &lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo;
said the postmaster, &lsquo;of teaching you to read,&rsquo;
and then for the rest of the afternoon he taught
her the alphabet.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>Thus, in a very short time, Ratan had got as
far as the double consonants.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the showers of the season
would never end. Canals, ditches, and hollows
were all overflowing with water. Day and night
the patter of rain was heard, and the croaking of
frogs. The village roads became impassable, and
marketing had to be done in punts.</p>

<p>One heavily clouded morning, the postmaster's
little pupil had been long waiting outside the door
for her call, but, not hearing it as usual, she took
up her dog-eared book, and slowly entered the
room. She found her master stretched out on his
pallet, and, thinking he was resting, she was about
to retire on tip-toe, when she suddenly heard her
name&mdash;&lsquo;Ratan!&rsquo; She turned at once and asked:
&lsquo;Were you sleeping, Dada?&rsquo; The postmaster in
a plaintive voice said: &lsquo;I am not well. Feel my
head; is it very hot?&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the loneliness of his exile, and in the gloom
of the rains, his ailing body needed a little tender
nursing. He longed to remember the touch on
the forehead of soft hands with tinkling bracelets,
to imagine the presence of loving womanhood, the
nearness of mother and sister. And the exile was
not disappointed. Ratan ceased to be a little girl.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
She at once stepped into the post of mother, called
in the village doctor, gave the patient his pills at
the proper intervals, sat up all night by his pillow,
cooked his gruel for him, and every now and then
asked: &lsquo;Are you feeling a little better, Dada?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was some time before the postmaster, with
weakened body, was able to leave his sick-bed.
&lsquo;No more of this,&rsquo; said he with decision. &lsquo;I must
get a transfer.&rsquo; He at once wrote off to Calcutta
an application for a transfer, on the ground of the
unhealthiness of the place.</p>

<p>Relieved from her duties as nurse, Ratan again
took up her old place outside the door. But she
no longer heard the same old call. She would
sometimes peep inside furtively to find the postmaster
sitting on his chair, or stretched on his
pallet, and staring absent-mindedly into the air.
While Ratan was awaiting her call, the postmaster
was awaiting a reply to his application. The girl
read her old lessons over and over again&mdash;her
great fear was lest, when the call came, she might
be found wanting in the double consonants. At
last, after a week, the call did come one evening.
With an overflowing heart Ratan rushed into
the room with her&mdash;&lsquo;Were you calling me,
Dada?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>The postmaster said: &lsquo;I am going away to-morrow,
Ratan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Dada?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am going home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When will you come back?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not coming <ins title="back.">back.&rsquo;</ins></p>

<p>Ratan asked no other question. The postmaster,
of his own accord, went on to tell her that
his application for a transfer had been rejected, so
he had resigned his post, and was going home.</p>

<p>For a long time neither of them spoke another
word. The lamp went on dimly burning, and
from a leak in one corner of the thatch water
dripped steadily into an earthen vessel on the
floor beneath it.</p>

<p>After a while Ratan rose, and went off to the
kitchen to prepare the meal; but she was not so
quick about it as on other days. Many new things
to think of had entered her little brain. When
the postmaster had finished his supper, the girl
suddenly asked him: &lsquo;Dada, will you take me to
your home?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The postmaster laughed. &lsquo;What an idea!&rsquo;
said he; but he did not think it necessary to
explain to the girl wherein lay the absurdity.</p>

<p>That whole night, in her waking and in her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
dreams, the postmaster's laughing reply haunted
her&mdash;&lsquo;What an idea!&rsquo;</p>

<p>On getting up in the morning, the postmaster
found his bath ready. He had stuck to his
Calcutta habit of bathing in water drawn and kept
in pitchers, instead of taking a plunge in the
river as was the custom of the village. For some
reason or other, the girl could not ask him about the
time of his departure, so she had fetched the water
from the river long before sunrise, that it should
be ready as early as he might want it. After the
bath came a call for Ratan. She entered noiselessly,
and looked silently into her master's face for
orders. The master said: &lsquo;You need not be
anxious about my going away, Ratan; I shall tell
my successor to look after you.&rsquo; These words
were kindly meant, no doubt: but inscrutable
are the ways of a woman's heart!</p>

<p>Ratan had borne many a scolding from her
master without complaint, but these kind words
she could not bear. She burst out weeping, and
said: &lsquo;No, no, you need not tell anybody anything
at all about me; I don't want to stay on
here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The postmaster was dumbfounded. He had
never seen Ratan like this before.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>The new incumbent duly arrived, and the
postmaster, having given over charge, prepared to
depart. Just before starting he called Ratan,
and said: &lsquo;Here is something for you; I hope
it will keep you for some little time.&rsquo; He brought
out from his pocket the whole of his month's
salary, retaining only a trifle for his travelling
expenses. Then Ratan fell at his feet and cried:
&lsquo;Oh, Dada, I pray you, don't give me anything,
don't in any way trouble about me,&rsquo; and then she
ran away out of sight.</p>

<p>The postmaster heaved a sigh, took up his
carpet bag, put his umbrella over his shoulder, and,
accompanied by a man carrying his many-coloured
tin trunk, he slowly made for the boat.</p>

<p>When he got in and the boat was under way,
and the rain-swollen river, like a stream of tears
welling up from the earth, swirled and sobbed at
her bows, then he felt a sort of pain at heart;
the grief-stricken face of a village girl seemed to
represent for him the great unspoken pervading
grief of Mother Earth herself. At one time he
had an impulse to go back, and bring away along
with him that lonesome waif, forsaken of the
world. But the wind had just filled the sails, the
boat had got well into the middle of the turbulent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169&ndash;170"> </a>
current, and already the village was left behind,
and its outlying burning-ground came in sight.</p>

<p>So the traveller, borne on the breast of the
swift-flowing river, consoled himself with philosophical
reflections on the numberless meetings
and partings going on in the world&mdash;on death,
the great parting, from which none returns.</p>

<p>But Ratan had no philosophy. She was
wandering about the post office in a flood of
tears. It may be that she had still a lurking hope
in some corner of her heart that her Dada would
return, and that is why she could not tear herself
away. Alas for the foolish human heart!</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>THE RIVER STAIRS</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">If</span> you wish to hear of days gone by, sit on this
step of mine, and lend your ears to the murmur
of the rippling water.</p>

<p>The month of <i>Ashwin</i> (September) was about
to begin. The river was in full flood. Only
four of my steps peeped above the surface. The
water had crept up to the low-lying parts of the
bank, where the <i>kachu</i> plant grew dense beneath
the branches of the mango grove. At that bend
of the river, three old brick-heaps towered above
the water around them. The fishing-boats, moored
to the trunks of the <i>bābla</i> trees on the bank,
rocked on the heaving flow-tide at dawn. The
path of tall grasses on the sandbank had caught
the newly risen sun; they had just begun to
flower, and were not yet in full bloom.</p>

<p>The little boats puffed out their tiny sails on
the sunlit river. The Brahmin priest had come
to bathe with his ritual vessels. The women
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
arrived in twos and threes to draw water. I
knew this was the time of Kusum's coming to the
bathing-stairs.</p>

<p>But that morning I missed her. Bhuban and
Swarno mourned at the <i>ghāt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> They said that
their friend had been led away to her husband's
house, which was a place far away from the river,
with strange people, strange houses, and strange
roads.</p>

<p>In time she almost faded out of my mind. A
year passed. The women at the <i>ghāt</i> now rarely
talked of Kusum. But one evening I was startled
by the touch of the long familiar feet. Ah,
yes, but those feet were now without anklets,
they had lost their old music.</p>

<p>Kusum had become a widow. They said that
her husband had worked in some far-off place,
and that she had met him only once or twice.
A letter brought her the news of his death. A
widow at eight years old, she had rubbed out the
wife's red mark from her forehead, stripped off
her bangles, and come back to her old home by
the Ganges. But she found few of her old playmates
there. Of them, Bhuban, Swarno, and
Amala were married, and gone away; only Sarat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
remained, and she too, they said, would be wed in
December next.</p>

<p>As the Ganges rapidly grows to fulness with
the coming of the rains, even so did Kusum day
by day grow to the fulness of beauty and youth.
But her dull-coloured robe, her pensive face, and
quiet manners drew a veil over her youth, and hid
it from men's eyes as in a mist. Ten years slipped
away, and none seemed to have noticed that Kusum
had grown up.</p>

<p>One morning such as this, at the end of a far-off
September, a tall, young, fair-skinned Sanyasi,
coming I know not whence, took shelter in the
Shiva temple, in front of me. His arrival was
noised abroad in the village. The women left
their pitchers behind, and crowded into the temple
to bow to the holy man.</p>

<p>The crowd increased day by day. The Sanyasi's
fame rapidly spread among the womenkind. One
day he would recite the <i>Bhágbat</i>, another day he
would expound the <i>Gita</i>, or hold forth upon a
holy book in the temple. Some sought him for
counsel, some for spells, some for medicines.</p>

<p>So months passed away. In April, at the time
of the solar eclipse, vast crowds came here to bathe
in the Ganges. A fair was held under the <i>bābla</i>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
tree. Many of the pilgrims went to visit the
Sanyasi, and among them were a party of women
from the village where Kusum had been married.</p>

<p>It was morning. The Sanyasi was counting
his beads on my steps, when all of a sudden one
of the women pilgrims nudged another, and said:
&lsquo;Why! He is our Kusum's husband!&rsquo; Another
parted her veil a little in the middle with two
fingers and cried out: &lsquo;Oh dear me! So it is!
He is the younger son of the Chattergu family of
our village!&rsquo; Said a third, who made little parade
of her veil: &lsquo;Ah! he has got exactly the same
brow, nose, and eyes!&rsquo; Yet another woman,
without turning to the Sanyasi, stirred the water
with her pitcher, and sighed: &lsquo;Alas! That young
man is no more; he will not come back. Bad
luck to Kusum!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But, objected one, &lsquo;He had not such a big
beard&rsquo;; and another, &lsquo;He was not so thin&rsquo;; or
&lsquo;He was most probably not so tall.&rsquo; That settled
the question for the time, and the matter spread
no further.</p>

<p>One evening, as the full moon arose, Kusum
came and sat upon my last step above the water,
and cast her shadow upon me.</p>

<p>There was no other at the <i>ghāt</i> just then. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
crickets were chirping about me. The din of
brass gongs and bells had ceased in the temple&mdash;the
last wave of sound grew fainter and fainter,
until it merged like the shade of a sound in the
dim groves of the farther bank. On the dark
water of the Ganges lay a line of glistening moonlight.
On the bank above, in bush and hedge,
under the porch of the temple, in the base of
ruined houses, by the side of the tank, in the palm
grove, gathered shadows of fantastic shape. The
bats swung from the <i>chhatim</i> boughs. Near the
houses the loud clamour of the jackals rose and
sank into silence.</p>

<p>Slowly the Sanyasi came out of the temple.
Descending a few steps of the <i>ghāt</i> he saw a
woman sitting alone, and was about to go back,
when suddenly Kusum raised her head, and looked
behind her. The veil slipped away from her.
The moonlight fell upon her face, as she looked up.</p>

<p>The owl flew away hooting over their heads.
Starting at the sound, Kusum came to herself and
put the veil back on her head. Then she bowed
low at the Sanyasi's feet.</p>

<p>He gave her blessing and asked: &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She replied: &lsquo;I am called Kusum.&rsquo;</p>

<p>No other word was spoken that night. Kusum
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
went slowly back to her house which was hard by.
But the Sanyasi remained sitting on my steps for
long hours that night. At last when the moon
passed from the east to the west, and the Sanyasi's
shadow, shifting from behind, fell in front of him,
he rose up and entered the temple.</p>

<p>Henceforth I saw Kusum come daily to bow at
his feet. When he expounded the holy books, she
stood in a corner listening to him. After finishing
his morning service, he used to call her to himself
and speak on religion. She could not have understood
it all; but, listening attentively in silence,
she tried to understand it. As he directed her,
so she acted implicitly. She daily served at the
temple&mdash;ever alert in the god's worship&mdash;gathering
flowers for the <i>puja</i>, and drawing water from
the Ganges to wash the temple floor.</p>

<p>The winter was drawing to its close. We had
cold winds. But now and then in the evening the
warm spring breeze would blow unexpectedly from
the south; the sky would lose its chilly aspect;
pipes would sound, and music be heard in the
village after a long silence. The boatmen would
set their boats drifting down the current, stop
rowing, and begin to sing the songs of Krishna.
This was the season.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>Just then I began to miss Kusum. For some
time she had given up visiting the temple, the
<i>ghāt</i>, or the Sanyasi.</p>

<p>What happened next I do not know, but after
a while the two met together on my steps one
evening.</p>

<p>With downcast looks, Kusum asked: &lsquo;Master,
did you send for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, why do I not see you? Why have you
grown neglectful of late in serving the gods?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She kept silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me your thoughts without reserve.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Half averting her face, she replied: &lsquo;I am a
sinner, Master, and hence I have failed in the
worship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Sanyasi said: &lsquo;Kusum, I know there is
unrest in your heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She gave a slight start, and, drawing the end of
her sári over her face, she sat down on the step at
the Sanyasi's feet, and wept.</p>

<p>He moved a little away, and said: &lsquo;Tell me
what you have in your heart, and I shall show
you the way to peace.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She replied in a tone of unshaken faith, stopping
now and then for words: &lsquo;If you bid me, I must
speak out. But, then, I cannot explain it clearly.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
You, Master, must have guessed it all. I adored
one as a god, I worshipped him, and the bliss of that
devotion filled my heart to fulness. But one night
I dreamt that the lord of my heart was sitting in
a garden somewhere, clasping my right hand in
his left, and whispering to me of love. The
whole scene did not appear to me at all strange.
The dream vanished, but its hold on me remained.
Next day when I beheld him he appeared in
another light than before. That dream-picture
continued to haunt my mind. I fled far from
him in fear, and the picture clung to me. Thenceforth
my heart has known no peace,&mdash;all has
grown dark within me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>While she was wiping her tears and telling
this tale, I felt that the Sanyasi was firmly pressing
my stone surface with his right foot.</p>

<p>Her speech done, the Sanyasi said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must tell me whom you saw in your
dream.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With folded hands, she entreated: &lsquo;I cannot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He insisted: &lsquo;You must tell me who he was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Wringing her hands she asked: &lsquo;Must I tell it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He replied: &lsquo;Yes, you must.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then crying, &lsquo;You are he, Master!&rsquo; she fell
on her face on my stony bosom, and sobbed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181&ndash;182"> </a>When she came to herself, and sat up, the
Sanyasi said slowly: &lsquo;I am leaving this place
to-night that you may not see me again. Know
that I am a Sanyasi, not belonging to this world.
<em>You</em> must forget me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kusum replied in a low voice: &lsquo;It will be so,
Master.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Sanyasi said: &lsquo;I take my leave.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Without a word more Kusum bowed to him,
and placed the dust of his feet on her head. He
left the place.</p>

<p>The moon set; the night grew dark. I
heard a splash in the water. The wind raved in
the darkness, as if it wanted to blow out all the
stars of the sky.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183&ndash;184"> </a>THE CASTAWAY</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>THE CASTAWAY</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Towards</span> evening the storm was at its height.
From the terrific downpour of rain, the crash of
thunder, and the repeated flashes of lightning,
you might think that a battle of the gods and
demons was raging in the skies. Black clouds
waved like the Flags of Doom. The Ganges was
lashed into a fury, and the trees of the gardens on
either bank swayed from side to side with sighs
and groans.</p>

<p>In a closed room of one of the riverside houses
at Chandernagore, a husband and his wife were
seated on a bed spread on the floor, intently
discussing. An earthen lamp burned beside them.</p>

<p>The husband, Sharat, was saying: &lsquo;I wish you
would stay on a few days more; you would then
be able to return home quite strong again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wife, Kiran, was saying: &lsquo;I have quite
recovered already. It will not, cannot possibly,
do me any harm to go home now.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>Every married person will at once understand
that the conversation was not quite so brief as I
have reported it. The matter was not difficult,
but the arguments for and against did not advance
it towards a solution. Like a rudderless boat,
the discussion kept turning round and round the
same point; and at last it threatened to be overwhelmed
in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Sharat said: &lsquo;The doctor thinks you should
stop here a few days longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kiran replied: &lsquo;Your doctor knows everything!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sharat, &lsquo;you know that just now
all sorts of illness are abroad. You would do
well to stop here a month or two more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And at this moment I suppose every one in
this place is perfectly well!&rsquo;</p>

<p>What had happened was this: Kiran was a
universal favourite with her family and neighbours,
so that, when she fell seriously ill, they were all
anxious. The village wiseacres thought it shameless
for her husband to make so much fuss about
a mere wife and even to suggest a change of air,
and asked if Sharat supposed that no woman had
ever been ill before, or whether he had found out
that the folk of the place to which he meant to
take her were immortal. Did he imagine that the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
writ of Fate did not run there? But Sharat and
his mother turned a deaf ear to them, thinking
that the little life of their darling was of greater
importance than the united wisdom of a village.
People are wont to reason thus when danger
threatens their loved ones. So Sharat went to
Chandernagore, and Kiran recovered, though she
was still very weak. There was a pinched look
on her face which filled the beholder with pity,
and made his heart tremble, as he thought how
narrowly she had escaped death.</p>

<p>Kiran was fond of society and amusement;
the loneliness of her riverside villa did not suit
her at all. There was nothing to do, there were
no interesting neighbours, and she hated to be
busy all day with medicine and dieting. There
was no fun in measuring doses and making
fomentations. Such was the subject discussed in
their closed room on this stormy evening.</p>

<p>So long as Kiran deigned to argue, there was a
chance of a fair fight. When she ceased to reply,
and with a toss of her head disconsolately looked
the other way, the poor man was disarmed. He
was on the point of surrendering unconditionally
when a servant shouted a message through the shut
door.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>Sharat got up, and, opening the door, learnt
that a boat had been upset in the storm, and that
one of the occupants, a young Brahmin boy, had
succeeded in swimming ashore in their garden.</p>

<p>Kiran was at once her own sweet self, and set
to work to get out some dry clothes for the boy.
She then warmed a cup of milk, and invited him
to her room.</p>

<p>The boy had long curly hair, big expressive
eyes, and no sign yet of hair on the face. Kiran,
after getting him to drink some milk, asked him
all about himself.</p>

<p>He told her that his name was Nilkanta, and
that he belonged to a theatrical troupe. They
were coming to play in a neighbouring villa when
the boat had suddenly foundered in the storm.
He had no idea what had become of his
companions. He was a good swimmer, and had
just managed to reach the shore.</p>

<p>The boy stayed with them. His narrow
escape from a terrible death made Kiran take a
warm interest in him. Sharat thought the boy's
appearance at this moment rather a good thing,
as his wife would now have something to amuse
her, and might be persuaded to stay on for some
time longer. Her mother-in-law, too, was pleased
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
at the prospect of profiting their Brahmin guest by
her kindness. And Nilkanta himself was delighted
at his double escape from his master and from
the other world, as well as at finding a home in
this wealthy family.</p>

<p>But in a short while Sharat and his mother
changed their opinion, and longed for his departure.
The boy found a secret pleasure in smoking
Sharat's hookas; he would calmly go off in
pouring rain with Sharat's best silk umbrella for a
stroll through the village, and make friends with
all whom he met. Moreover, he had got hold of a
mongrel village dog which he petted so recklessly
that it came indoors with muddy paws, and
left tokens of its visit on Sharat's spotless bed.
Then he gathered about him a devoted band of
boys of all sorts and sizes, and the result was that
not a solitary mango in the neighbourhood had a
chance of ripening that season.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Kiran had a hand in
spoiling the boy. Sharat often warned her about
it, but she would not listen to him. She made a
dandy of him with Sharat's cast-off clothes, and
gave him new ones too. And because she felt
drawn towards him, and also had a curiosity to
know more about him, she was constantly calling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>
him to her own room. After her bath and mid-day
meal Kiran would be seated on the bedstead with
her betel-leaf box by her side; and while her
maid combed and dried her hair, Nilkanta would
stand in front and recite pieces out of his repertory
with appropriate gesture and song, his elf-locks
waving wildly. Thus the long afternoon hours
passed merrily away. Kiran would often try to
persuade Sharat to sit with her as one of the
audience, but Sharat, who had taken a cordial
dislike to the boy, refused, nor could Nilkanta do
his part half so well when Sharat was there. His
mother would sometimes be lured by the hope of
hearing sacred names in the recitation; but love
of her mid-day sleep speedily overcame devotion,
and she lay lapped in dreams.</p>

<p>The boy often got his ears boxed and pulled
by Sharat, but as this was nothing to what he
had been used to as a member of the troupe,
he did not mind it in the least. In his short experience
of the world he had come to the conclusion
that, as the earth consisted of land and water, so
human life was made up of eatings and beatings,
and that the beatings largely predominated.</p>

<p>It was hard to tell Nilkanta's age. If it was
about fourteen or fifteen, then his face was too old
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
for his years; if seventeen or eighteen, then it was
too young. He was either a man too early or
a boy too late. The fact was that, joining the
theatrical band when very young, he had played
the parts of Radhika, Damaynti, Sita, and Bidya's
Companion. A thoughtful Providence so arranged
things that he grew to the exact stature that his
manager required, and then growth ceased. Since
every one saw how small he was, and he himself
felt small, he did not receive due respect for his
years. These causes, natural and artificial, combined
to make him sometimes seem immature for
seventeen years, and at other times a lad of fourteen
but far too knowing for seventeen. And as
no sign of hair appeared on his face, the confusion
became greater. Either because he smoked or
because he used language beyond his years, his lips
puckered into lines that showed him to be old and
hard; but innocence and youth shone in his large
eyes. I fancy that his heart remained young, but
the hot glare of publicity had been a forcing-house
that ripened untimely his outward aspect.</p>

<p>In the quiet shelter of Sharat's house and garden
at Chandernagore, Nature had leisure to work her
way unimpeded. He had lingered in a kind of
unnatural youth, but now he silently and swiftly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
overpassed that stage. His seventeen or eighteen
years came to adequate revelation. No one observed
the change, and its first sign was this, that when
Kiran treated him like a boy, he felt ashamed.
When the gay Kiran one day proposed that he
should play the part of lady's companion, the idea
of woman's dress hurt him, though he could not
say why. So now, when she called for him to act
over again his old characters, he disappeared. It
never occurred to him that he was even now not
much more than a lad-of-all-work in a strolling
company. He even made up his mind to pick
up a little education from Sharat's factor. But,
because Nilkanta was the pet of his master's wife,
the factor could not endure the sight of him. Also,
his restless training made it impossible for him to
keep his mind long engaged; presently, the alphabet
did a misty dance before his eyes. He would sit
long enough with an open book on his lap, leaning
against a <i>champak</i> bush beside the Ganges. The
waves sighed below, boats floated past, birds flitted
and twittered restlessly above. What thoughts
passed through his mind as he looked down on
that book he alone knew, if indeed he did know.
He never advanced from one word to another, but
the glorious thought that he was actually reading
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
a book filled his soul with exultation. Whenever
a boat went by, he lifted his book, and pretended
to be reading hard, shouting at the top of his voice.
But his energy dropped as soon as the audience
was gone.</p>

<p>Formerly he sang his songs automatically, but
now their tunes stirred in his mind. Their words
were of little import, and full of trifling alliteration.
Even the little meaning they had was beyond his
comprehension; yet when he sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry width20">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Twice-born<a name="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> bird! ah! wherefore stirred<br/></div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"> then he felt as if transported to another world,
and to far other folk. This familiar earth and
his own poor life became music, and he was transformed.
That tale of goose and king's daughter
flung upon the mirror of his mind a picture of
surpassing beauty. It is impossible to say what he
imagined he himself was, but the destitute little
slave of the theatrical troupe faded from his
memory.</p>

<p>When with evening the child of want lies down,
dirty and hungry, in his squalid home, and hears
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
of prince and princess and fabled gold, then in the
dark hovel with its dim flickering candle, his mind
springs free from her bonds of poverty and misery,
and walks in fresh beauty and glowing raiment,
strong beyond all fear of hindrance, through that
fairy realm where all is possible.</p>

<p>Even so, this drudge of wandering players
fashioned himself and his world anew, as he moved
in spirit amid his songs. The lapping water,
rustling leaves, and calling birds; the goddess who
had given shelter to him, the helpless, the Godforsaken;
her gracious, lovely face, her exquisite
arms with their shining bangles, her rosy feet as
soft as flower-petals; all these by some magic
became one with the music of his song. When the
singing ended, the mirage faded, and Nilkanta of
the stage appeared again, with his wild elf-locks.
Fresh from the complaints of his neighbour, the
owner of the despoiled mango-orchard, Sharat
would come and box his ears, and cuff him. The
boy Nilkanta, the misleader of adoring youths,
went forth once more, to make ever new mischief
by land and water and in the branches that are
above the earth.</p>

<p>Shortly after the advent of Nilkanta, Sharat's
younger brother, Satish, came to spend his college
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>
vacation with them. Kiran was hugely pleased at
finding a fresh occupation. She and Satish were
of the same age, and the time passed pleasantly in
games and quarrels and makings-up and laughter
and even tears. Suddenly she would clasp him
over the eyes, from behind, with vermilion-stained
hands, she would write &lsquo;monkey&rsquo; on his back,
and sometimes bolt the door on him from outside
amidst peals of laughter. Satish in his turn did
not take things lying down; he would take her
keys and rings, he would put pepper among her
betel; he would tie her to the bed when she was
not looking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, heaven only knows what possessed
poor Nilkanta. He was suddenly filled with a
bitterness which he must avenge on somebody or
something. He thrashed his devoted boy-followers
for no fault, and sent them away crying. He
would kick his pet mongrel till it made the skies
resound with its whinings. When he went out
for a walk, he would litter his path with twigs
and leaves beaten from the roadside shrubs with
his cane.</p>

<p>Kiran liked to see people enjoying good fare.
Nilkanta had an immense capacity for eating, and
never refused a good thing, however often it was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
offered. So Kiran liked to send for him to have
his meals in her presence, and ply him with delicacies,
happy in the bliss of seeing this Brahmin
boy eat to satiety. After Satish's arrival she had
much less spare time on her hands, and was seldom
present when Nilkanta's meals were served. Before,
her absence made no difference to the boy's appetite,
and he would not rise till he had drained his
cup of milk, and rinsed it thoroughly with water.<a name="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>But now, if Kiran was not present to ask
him to try this and that, he was miserable, and
nothing tasted right. He would get up without
eating much, and say to the serving-maid in a
choking voice: &lsquo;I am not hungry.&rsquo; He thought
in imagination that the news of his repeated refusal,
&lsquo;I am not hungry,&rsquo; would reach Kiran; he pictured
her concern, and hoped that she would send for
him, and press him to eat. But nothing of the
sort happened. Kiran never knew, and never sent
for him; and the maid finished whatever he left.
He would then put out the lamp in his room, and
throw himself on his bed in the darkness, burying
his head in the pillow in a paroxysm of sobs.
What was his grievance? Against whom? And
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
from whom did he expect redress? At last, when
none else came, Mother Sleep soothed with her soft
caresses the wounded heart of the motherless lad.</p>

<p>Nilkanta came to the unshakable conviction
that Satish was poisoning Kiran's mind against him.
If Kiran was absent-minded, and had not her usual
smile, he would jump to the conclusion that some
trick of Satish had made her angry with him. He
took to praying to the gods, with all the fervour of
his hate, to make him at the next rebirth Satish,
and Satish him. He had an idea that a Brahmin's
wrath could never be in vain; and the more he
tried to consume Satish with the fire of his curses,
the more did his own heart burn within him. And
upstairs he would hear Satish laughing and joking
with his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Nilkanta never dared openly to show his enmity
to Satish. But he would contrive a hundred petty
ways of causing him annoyance. When Satish
went for a swim in the river, and left his soap on
the steps of the bathing-place, on coming back for
it he would find that it had disappeared. Once
he found his favourite striped tunic floating past
him on the water, and thought it had been blown
away by the wind.</p>

<p>One day Kiran, desiring to entertain Satish,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
sent for Nilkanta to recite as usual, but he stood
there in gloomy silence. Quite surprised, Kiran
asked him what was the matter. But he remained
silent. And when again pressed by her to repeat
some particular favourite piece of hers, he answered:
&lsquo;I don't remember,&rsquo; and walked away.</p>

<p>At last the time came for their return home.
Everybody was busy packing up. Satish was going
with them. But to Nilkanta nobody said a word.
The question whether he was to go or not seemed
not to have occurred to anybody.</p>

<p>The question, as a matter of fact, had been
raised by Kiran, who had proposed to take him
along with them. But her husband and his mother
and brother had all objected so strenuously that
she let the matter drop. A couple of days before
they were to start, she sent for the boy, and with
kind words advised him to go back to his own
home.</p>

<p>So many days had he felt neglected that this
touch of kindness was too much for him; he burst
into tears. Kiran's eyes were also brimming over.
She was filled with remorse at the thought that she
had created a tie of affection, which could not be
permanent.</p>

<p>But Satish was much annoyed at the blubbering
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
of this overgrown boy. &lsquo;Why does the fool stand
there howling instead of speaking?&rsquo; said he.
When Kiran scolded him for an unfeeling creature,
he replied: &lsquo;Sister mine, you do not understand.
You are too good and trustful. This fellow turns
up from the Lord knows where, and is treated like
a king. Naturally the tiger has no wish to become
a mouse again.<a name="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> And he has evidently discovered
that there is nothing like a tear or two to soften
your heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nilkanta hurriedly left the spot. He felt he
would like to be a knife to cut Satish to pieces; a
needle to pierce him through and through; a fire to
burn him to ashes. But Satish was not even scarred.
It was only his own heart that bled and bled.</p>

<p>Satish had brought with him from Calcutta a
grand inkstand. The inkpot was set in a mother-of-pearl
boat drawn by a German-silver goose
supporting a penholder. It was a great favourite
of his, and he cleaned it carefully every day with
an old silk handkerchief. Kiran would laugh and,
tapping the silver bird's beak, would say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Twice-born bird, ah! wherefore stirred<br/></div>
<div class="line" style="margin-left: 1.2em;">To wrong our royal lady?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a> and the usual war of words would break out
between her and her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The day before they were to start, the inkstand
was missing, and could nowhere be found. Kiran
smiled, and said: &lsquo;Brother-in-law, your goose has
flown off to look for your <ins title="Damaynti.&rdquo;">Damaynti.&rsquo;</ins><a name="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But Satish was in a great rage. He was certain
that Nilkanta had stolen it&mdash;for several people said
they had seen him prowling about the room the
night before. He had the accused brought before
him. Kiran also was there. &lsquo;You have stolen
my inkstand, you thief!&rsquo; he blurted out. &lsquo;Bring
it back at once.&rsquo; Nilkanta had always taken
punishment from Sharat, deserved or undeserved,
with perfect equanimity. But, when he was called
a thief in Kiran's presence, his eyes blazed with a
fierce anger, his breast swelled, and his throat
choked. If Satish had said another word he would
have flown at him like a wild cat, and used his nails
like claws.</p>

<p>Kiran was greatly distressed at the scene, and
taking the boy into another room said in her sweet,
kind way: &lsquo;Nilu, if you really have taken that
inkstand give it to me quietly, and I shall see that
no one says another word to you about it.&rsquo; Big
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>
tears coursed down the boy's cheeks, till at last he
hid his face in his hands, and wept bitterly. Kiran
came back from the room, and said: &lsquo;I am sure
Nilkanta has not taken the inkstand.&rsquo; Sharat and
Satish were equally positive that no other than
Nilkanta could have done it.</p>

<p>But Kiran said determinedly: &lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sharat wanted to cross-examine the boy, but
his wife refused to allow it.</p>

<p>Then Satish suggested that his room and box
should be searched. And Kiran said: &lsquo;If you
dare do such a thing I will never, never forgive
you. You shall not spy on the poor innocent boy.&rsquo;
And as she spoke, her wonderful eyes filled with
tears. That settled the matter, and effectually
prevented any further molestation of Nilkanta!</p>

<p>Kiran's heart overflowed with pity at this
attempted outrage on a homeless lad. She got
two new suits of clothes and a pair of shoes, and
with these and a banknote in her hand she quietly
went into Nilkanta's room in the evening. She
intended to put these parting presents into his box
as a surprise. The box itself had been her gift.</p>

<p>From her bunch of keys she selected one that
fitted, and noiselessly opened the box. It was so
jumbled up with odds and ends that the new
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>
clothes would not go in. So she thought she had
better take everything out and pack the box for
him. At first knives, tops, kite-flying reels,
bamboo twigs, polished shells for peeling green
mangoes, bottoms of broken tumblers and such
like things dear to a boy's heart were discovered.
Then there came a layer of linen, clean and otherwise.
And from under the linen there emerged
the missing inkstand, goose and all!</p>

<p>Kiran, with flushed face, sat down helplessly
with the inkstand in her hand, puzzled and
wondering.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Nilkanta had come into the
room from behind without Kiran knowing it.
He had seen the whole thing, and thought that
Kiran had come like a thief to catch him in his
thieving,&mdash;and that his deed was out. How
could he ever hope to convince her that he was
not a thief, and that only revenge had prompted
him to take the inkstand, which he meant to
throw into the river at the first chance? In a weak
moment he had put it in his box instead. &lsquo;He
was not a thief,&rsquo; his heart cried out, &lsquo;not a thief!&rsquo;
Then what was he? What could he say? He
had stolen, and yet he was not a thief! He could
never explain to Kiran how grievously wrong
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203&ndash;204"> </a>
she was in taking him for a thief; how could he
bear the thought that she had tried to spy on him?</p>

<p>At last Kiran with a deep sigh replaced the
inkstand in the box, and, as if she were the thief
herself, covered it up with the linen and the
trinkets as they were before; and at the top she
placed the presents together with the banknote
which she had brought for him.</p>

<p>The next day the boy was nowhere to be found.
The villagers had not seen him; the police could
discover no trace of him. Said Sharat: &lsquo;Now,
as a matter of curiosity, let us have a look at
his box.&rsquo; But Kiran was obstinate in her refusal
to allow that to be done.</p>

<p>She had the box brought up to her own room;
and taking out the inkstand alone, threw it into
the river.</p>

<p>The whole family went home. In a day the
garden became desolate. And only that starving
mongrel of Nilkanta's remained prowling along
the river-bank, whining and whining as if its heart
would break.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205&ndash;206"> </a>SAVED</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>SAVED</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">Gouri</span> was the beautiful, delicately nurtured child
of an old and wealthy family. Her husband,
Paresh, had recently by his own efforts improved
his straitened circumstances. So long as he
was poor, Gouri's parents had kept their daughter
at home, unwilling to surrender her to privation;
so she was no longer young when at last she went
to her husband's house. And Paresh never felt
quite that she belonged to him. He was an
advocate in a small western town, and had
no close kinsman with him. All his thought
was about his wife, so much so that sometimes
he would come home before the rising of the
Court. At first Gouri was at a loss to understand
why he came back suddenly. Sometimes, too, he
would dismiss one of the servants without reason;
none of them ever suited him long. Especially
if Gouri desired to keep any particular servant
because he was useful, that man was sure to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>
got rid of forthwith. The high-spirited Gouri
greatly resented this, but her resentment only made
her husband's behaviour still stranger.</p>

<p>At last when Paresh, unable to contain himself
any longer, began in secret to cross-question the
maid about her, the whole thing reached his wife's
ears. She was a woman of few words; but her pride
raged within like a wounded lioness at these insults,
and this mad suspicion swept like a destroyer's
sword between them. Paresh, as soon as he saw
that his wife understood his motive, felt no more
delicacy about taxing Gouri to her face; and the
more his wife treated it with silent contempt,
the more did the fire of his jealousy consume
him.</p>

<p>Deprived of wedded happiness, the childless
Gouri betook herself to the consolations of religion.
She sent for Paramananda Swami, the young
preacher of the Prayer-House hard by, and, formally
acknowledging him as her spiritual preceptor,
asked him to expound the <i>Gita</i> to her. All the
wasted love and affection of her woman's heart was
poured out in reverence at the feet of her Guru.</p>

<p>No one had any doubts about the purity of
Paramananda's character. All worshipped him.
And because Paresh did not dare to hint at any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
suspicion against him, his jealousy ate its way into
his heart like a hidden cancer.</p>

<p>One day some trifling circumstance made the
poison overflow. Paresh reviled Paramananda to his
wife as a hypocrite, and said: &lsquo;Can you swear that you
are not in love with this crane that plays the ascetic?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gouri sprang up like a snake that has been
trodden on, and, maddened by his suspicion, said
with bitter irony: &lsquo;And what if I am?&rsquo; At this
Paresh forthwith went off to the Court-house, and
locked the door on her.</p>

<p>In a white heat of passion at this last outrage,
Gouri got the door open somehow, and left the house.</p>

<p>Paramananda was poring over the scriptures in
his lonely room in the silence of noon. All at
once, like a flash of lightning out of a cloudless
sky, Gouri broke in upon his reading.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You here?&rsquo; questioned her Guru in surprise.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Rescue me, O my lord Guru,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;from the insults of my home life, and allow me to
dedicate myself to the service of your feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a stern rebuke, Paramananda sent Gouri
back home. But I wonder whether he ever again
took up the snapped thread of his reading.</p>

<p>Paresh, finding the door open, on his return
home, asked: &lsquo;Who has been here?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>&lsquo;No one!&rsquo; his wife replied. &lsquo;<em>I</em> have been to
the house of my Guru.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; asked Paresh, pale and red by turns.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because I wanted to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>From that day Paresh had a guard kept over
the house, and behaved so absurdly that the tale
of his jealousy was told all over the town.</p>

<p>The news of the shameful insults that were
daily heaped on his disciple disturbed the religious
meditations of Paramananda. He felt he ought to
leave the place at once; at the same time he could
not make up his mind to forsake the tortured
woman. Who can say how the poor ascetic got
through those terrible days and nights?</p>

<p>At last one day the imprisoned Gouri got a
letter. &lsquo;My child,&rsquo; it ran, &lsquo;it is true that many
holy women have left the world to devote themselves
to God. Should it happen that the trials of
this world are driving your thoughts away from
God, I will with God's help rescue his handmaid
for the holy service of his feet. If you desire, you
may meet me by the tank in your garden at two
o'clock to-morrow afternoon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gouri hid the letter in the loops of her hair.
At noon next day when she was undoing her hair
before her bath she found that the letter was not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
there. Could it have fallen on to the bed and got
into her husband's hands, she wondered. At first,
she felt a kind of fierce pleasure in thinking that
it would enrage him; and then she could not bear
to think that this letter, worn as a halo of deliverance
on her head, might be defiled by the touch of
insolent hands.</p>

<p>With swift steps she hurried to her husband's
room. He lay groaning on the floor, with eyes
rolled back and foaming mouth. She detached the
letter from his clenched fist, and sent quickly for
a doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor said it was a case of apoplexy. The
patient had died before his arrival.</p>

<p>That very day, as it happened, Paresh had
an important appointment away from home.
Paramananda had found this out, and accordingly
had made his appointment with Gouri. To such a
depth had he fallen!</p>

<p>When the widowed Gouri caught sight from the
window of her Guru stealing like a thief to the side
of the pool, she lowered her eyes as at a lightning
flash. And in that flash she saw clearly what a fall
his had been.</p>

<p>The Guru called: &lsquo;Gouri.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am coming,&rsquo; she replied.</p>

<p class="dot-break">. . . . . .</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>When Paresh's friends heard of his death, and
came to assist in the last rites, they found the dead
body of Gouri lying beside that of her husband. She
had poisoned herself. All were lost in admiration
of the wifely loyalty she had shown in her <i>sati</i>, a
loyalty rare indeed in these degenerate days.</p>

<div class="story-title"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213&ndash;214"> </a>MY FAIR NEIGHBOUR</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>MY FAIR NEIGHBOUR</h2>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="small-caps">My</span> feelings towards the young widow who lived
in the next house to mine were feelings of worship;
at least, that is what I told to my friends and myself.
Even my nearest intimate, Nabin, knew
nothing of the real state of my mind. And I had
a sort of pride that I could keep my passion pure
by thus concealing it in the inmost recesses of
my heart. She was like a dew-drenched <i>sephali</i>-blossom,
untimely fallen to earth. Too radiant and
holy for the flower-decked marriage-bed, she had
been dedicated to Heaven.</p>

<p>But passion is like the mountain stream, and
refuses to be enclosed in the place of its birth;
it must seek an outlet. That is why I tried to
give expression to my emotions in poems; but my
unwilling pen refused to desecrate the object of
my worship.</p>

<p>It happened curiously that just at this time
my friend Nabin was afflicted with a madness of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
verse. It came upon him like an earthquake. It
was the poor fellow's first attack, and he was equally
unprepared for rhyme and rhythm. Nevertheless
he could not refrain, for he succumbed to
the fascination, as a widower to his second
wife.</p>

<p>So Nabin sought help from me. The subject of
his poems was the old, old one, which is ever new:
his poems were all addressed to the beloved one.
I slapped his back in jest, and asked him: &lsquo;Well,
old chap, who is she?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nabin laughed, as he replied: &lsquo;That I have
not yet discovered!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I confess that I found considerable comfort in
bringing help to my friend. Like a hen brooding
on a duck's egg, I lavished all the warmth
of my pent-up passion on Nabin's effusions. So
vigorously did I revise and improve his crude
productions, that the larger part of each poem
became my own.</p>

<p>Then Nabin would say in surprise: &lsquo;That is
just what I wanted to say, but could not. How
on earth do you manage to get hold of all these
fine sentiments?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Poet-like, I would reply: &lsquo;They come from
my imagination; for, as you know, truth is silent,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
and it is imagination only which waxes eloquent.
Reality represses the flow of feeling like a rock;
imagination cuts out a path for itself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the poor puzzled Nabin would say: &lsquo;Y-e-s,
I see, yes, of course&rsquo;; and then after some thought
would murmur again: &lsquo;Yes, yes, you are right!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As I have already said, in my own love there
was a feeling of reverential delicacy which prevented
me from putting it into words. But with Nabin
as a screen, there was nothing to hinder the flow
of my pen; and a true warmth of feeling gushed
out into these vicarious poems.</p>

<p>Nabin in his lucid moments would say: &lsquo;But
these are yours! Let me publish them over your
name.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; I would reply. &lsquo;They are yours,
my dear fellow; I have only added a touch or two
here and there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Nabin gradually came to believe it.</p>

<p>I will not deny that, with a feeling akin to that
of the astronomer gazing into the starry heavens,
I did sometimes turn my eyes towards the window
of the house next door. It is also true that now
and again my furtive glances would be rewarded
with a vision. And the least glimpse of the pure
light of that countenance would at once still and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>
clarify all that was turbulent and unworthy in my
emotions.</p>

<p>But one day I was startled. Could I believe
my eyes? It was a hot summer afternoon. One
of the fierce and fitful nor'-westers was threatening.
Black clouds were massed in the north-west corner
of the sky; and against the strange and fearful
light of that background my fair neighbour stood,
gazing out into empty space. And what a world
of forlorn longing did I discover in the far-away
look of those lustrous black eyes! Was there
then, perchance, still some living volcano within
the serene radiance of that moon of mine? Alas!
that look of limitless yearning, which was winging
its way through the clouds like an eager bird,
surely sought&mdash;not heaven&mdash;but the nest of some
human heart!</p>

<p>At the sight of the unutterable passion of that
look I could hardly contain myself. I was no
longer satisfied with correcting crude poems. My
whole being longed to express itself in some worthy
action. At last I thought I would devote myself
to making widow-remarriage popular in my
country. I was prepared not only to speak and
write on the subject, but also to spend money on
its cause.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>Nabin began to argue with me. &lsquo;Permanent
widowhood,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;has in it a sense of immense
purity and peace; a calm beauty like that of the
silent places of the dead shimmering in the wan
light of the eleventh moon.<a name="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Would not the
mere possibility of remarriage destroy its divine
beauty?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now this sort of sentimentality always makes
me furious. In time of famine, if a well-fed man
speaks scornfully of food, and advises a starving
man at point of death to glut his hunger on the
fragrance of flowers and the song of birds, what
are we to think of him? I said with some heat:
&lsquo;Look here, Nabin, to the artist a ruin may be a
beautiful object; but houses are built not only
for the contemplation of artists, but that people
may live therein; so they have to be kept in
repair in spite of artistic susceptibilities. It
is all very well for you to idealise widowhood
from your safe distance, but you should
remember that within widowhood there is a
sensitive human heart, throbbing with pain and
desire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I had an impression that the conversion of
Nabin would be a difficult matter, so perhaps I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>
was more impassioned than I need have been. I
was somewhat surprised to find at the conclusion
of my little speech that Nabin after a single
thoughtful sigh completely agreed with me. The
even more convincing peroration which I felt I
might have delivered was not needed!</p>

<p>After about a week Nabin came to me, and
said that if I would help him he was prepared to
lead the way by marrying a widow himself.</p>

<p>I was overjoyed. I embraced him effusively,
and promised him any money that might be required
for the purpose. Then Nabin told me his
story.</p>

<p>I learned that Nabin's loved one was not an
imaginary being. It appeared that Nabin, too,
had for some time adored a widow from a distance,
but had not spoken of his feelings to any living
soul. Then the magazines in which Nabin's
poems, or rather <em>my</em> poems, used to appear had
reached the fair one's hands; and the poems had
not been ineffective.</p>

<p>Not that Nabin had deliberately intended, as
he was careful to explain, to conduct love-making
in that way. In fact, said he, he had no idea
that the widow knew how to read. He used to
post the magazine, without disclosing the sender's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
name, addressed to the widow's brother. It was
only a sort of fancy of his, a concession to his
hopeless passion. It was flinging garlands before
a deity; it is not the worshipper's affair whether
the god knows or not, whether he accepts or
ignores the offering.</p>

<p>And Nabin particularly wanted me to understand
that he had no definite end in view when on
diverse pretexts he sought and made the acquaintance
of the widow's brother. Any near relation
of the loved one needs must have a special interest
for the lover.</p>

<p>Then followed a long story about how an illness
of the brother at last brought them together.
The presence of the poet himself naturally led to
much discussion of the poems; nor was the discussion
necessarily restricted to the subject out of
which it arose.</p>

<p>After his recent defeat in argument at my
hands, Nabin had mustered up courage to propose
marriage to the widow. At first he could not
gain her consent. But when he had made full use
of my eloquent words, supplemented by a tear or
two of his own, the fair one capitulated unconditionally.
Some money was now wanted by her
guardian to make arrangements.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>&lsquo;Take it at once,&rsquo; said I.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; Nabin went on, &lsquo;you know it will be
some months before I can appease my father
sufficiently for him to continue my allowance.
How are we to live in the meantime?&rsquo; I wrote
out the necessary cheque without a word, and then
I said: &lsquo;Now tell me who she is. You need not
look on me as a possible rival, for I swear I
will not write poems to her; and even if I do
I will not send them to her brother, but to
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don't be absurd,&rsquo; said Nabin; &lsquo;I have not
kept back her name because I feared your rivalry!
The fact is, she was very much perturbed at taking
this unusual step, and had asked me not to talk
about the matter to my friends. But it no longer
matters, now that everything has been satisfactorily
settled. She lives at No. 19, the house next to
yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If my heart had been an iron boiler it would
have burst. &lsquo;So she has no objection to remarriage?&rsquo;
I simply asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at the present moment,&rsquo; replied Nabin
with a smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And was it the poems alone which wrought
the magic change?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>&lsquo;Well, my poems were not so bad, you know,&rsquo;
said Nabin, &lsquo;were they?&rsquo;</p>

<p>I swore mentally.</p>

<p>But at whom was I to swear? At him? At
myself? At Providence? All the same, I swore.</p>

The incidents described in this story, now happily a thing of the past,
were by no means rare in Bengal at one time. Our author, however,
slightly departs from the current accounts. Such criminally superstitious
practices were resorted to by miserly persons under the idea that they themselves
would re-acquire the treasure in a future state of existence. &lsquo;When
you see me in a future birth passing this way, you must make over all this
treasure to me. Guard it till then and stir not,&rsquo;&mdash;was the usual promise
exacted from the victim before he became <i>yak</i>. Many were the &lsquo;true&rsquo;
stories we heard in childhood of people becoming suddenly rich by coming
across ghostly custodians of wealth belonging to them in a past birth.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
