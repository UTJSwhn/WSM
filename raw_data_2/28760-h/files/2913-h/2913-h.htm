    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is the night of Christmas Eve, the SCENE is a Studio, flush with the
        street, having a skylight darkened by a fall of snow. There is no one in
        the room, the walls of which are whitewashed, above a floor of bare dark
        boards. A fire is cheerfully burning. On a model's platform stands an
        easel and canvas. There are busts and pictures; a screen, a little
        stool, two arm. chairs, and a long old-fashioned settle under the
        window. A door in one wall leads to the house, a door in the opposite
        wall to the model's dressing-room, and the street door is in the centre
        of the wall between. On a low table a Russian samovar is hissing, and
        beside it on a tray stands a teapot, with glasses, lemon, sugar, and a
        decanter of rum. Through a huge uncurtained window close to the street
        door the snowy lamplit street can be seen, and beyond it the river and a
        night of stars. The sound of a latchkey turned in the lock of the street
        door, and ANN WELLWYN enters, a girl of seventeen, with hair tied in a
        ribbon and covered by a scarf. Leaving the door open, she turns up the
        electric light and goes to the fire. She throws of her scarf and long
        red cloak. She is dressed in a high evening frock of some soft white
        material. Her movements are quick and substantial. Her face, full of no
        nonsense, is decided and sincere, with deep-set eyes, and a capable,
        well-shaped forehead. Shredding of her gloves she warms her hands. In
        the doorway appear the figures of two men. The first is rather short and
        slight, with a soft short beard, bright soft eyes, and a crumply face.
        Under his squash hat his hair is rather plentiful and rather grey. He
        wears an old brown ulster and woollen gloves, and is puffing at a
        hand-made cigarette. He is ANN'S father, WELLWYN, the artist. His
        companion is a well-wrapped clergyman of medium height and stoutish
        build, with a pleasant, rosy face, rather shining eyes, and rather
        chubby clean-shaped lips; in appearance, indeed, a grown-up boy. He is
        the Vicar of the parish&mdash;CANON BERTLEY.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. My dear Wellwyn, the whole question of reform is full of
      difficulty. When you have two men like Professor Calway and Sir Thomas
      Hoxton taking diametrically opposite points of view, as we've seen
      to-night, I confess, I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Come in, Vicar, and have some grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Not to-night, thanks! Christmas tomorrow! Great temptation,
      though, this room! Goodnight, Wellwyn; good-night, Ann!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Coming from the fire towards the tea-table.] Good-night, Canon
      Bertley.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He goes out, and WELLWYN, shutting the door after him, approaches the
        fire.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANN. [Sitting on the little stool, with her back to the fire, and making
      tea.] Daddy!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. You say you liked Professor Calway's lecture. Is it going to do you
      any good, that's the question?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I&mdash;I hope so, Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. I took you on purpose. Your charity's getting simply awful. Those two
      this morning cleared out all my housekeeping money.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Um! Um! I quite understand your feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. They both had your card, so I couldn't refuse&mdash;didn't know what
      you'd said to them. Why don't you make it a rule never to give your card
      to anyone except really decent people, and&mdash;picture dealers, of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear, I have&mdash;often.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Then why don't you keep it? It's a frightful habit. You are naughty,
      Daddy. One of these days you'll get yourself into most fearful
      complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear, when they&mdash;when they look at you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. You know the house wants all sorts of things. Why do you speak to
      them at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I don't&mdash;they speak to me.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He takes of his ulster and hangs it over the back of an arm-chair.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANN. They see you coming. Anybody can see you coming, Daddy. That's why
      you ought to be so careful. I shall make you wear a hard hat. Those
      squashy hats of yours are hopelessly inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Gazing at his hat.] Calway wears one.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. As if anyone would beg of Professor Calway.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well-perhaps not. You know, Ann, I admire that fellow. Wonderful
      power of-of-theory! How a man can be so absolutely tidy in his mind! It's
      most exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Has any one begged of you to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Doubtfully.] No&mdash;no.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [After a long, severe look.] Will you have rum in your tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Crestfallen.] Yes, my dear&mdash;a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Pouring out the rum, and handing him the glass.] Well, who was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. He didn't beg of me. [Losing himself in recollection.]
      Interesting old creature, Ann&mdash;real type. Old cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Just on the Embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Of course! Daddy, you know the Embankment ones are always rotters.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Yes, my dear; but this wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Did you give him your card?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I&mdash;I&mdash;don't
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Did you, Daddy?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I'm rather afraid I may have!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. May have! It's simply immoral.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, the old fellow was so awfully human, Ann. Besides, I didn't
      give him any money&mdash;hadn't got any.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Look here, Daddy! Did you ever ask anybody for anything? You know you
      never did, you'd starve first. So would anybody decent. Then, why won't
      you see that people who beg are rotters?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. But, my dear, we're not all the same. They wouldn't do it if it
      wasn't natural to them. One likes to be friendly. What's the use of being
      alive if one isn't?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Daddy, you're hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. But, look here, Ann, the whole thing's so jolly complicated.
      According to Calway, we're to give the State all we can spare, to make the
      undeserving deserving. He's a Professor; he ought to know. But old
      Hoxton's always dinning it into me that we ought to support private
      organisations for helping the deserving, and damn the undeserving. Well,
      that's just the opposite. And he's a J.P. Tremendous experience. And the
      Vicar seems to be for a little bit of both. Well, what the devil&mdash;&mdash;?
      My trouble is, whichever I'm with, he always converts me. [Ruefully.] And
      there's no fun in any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Rising.] Oh! Daddy, you are so&mdash;don't you know that you're the
      despair of all social reformers? [She envelops him.] There's a tear in the
      left knee of your trousers. You're not to wear them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Am I likely to?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. I shouldn't be a bit surprised if it isn't your only pair. D'you know
      what I live in terror of?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WELLWYN gives her a queer and apprehensive look.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANN. That you'll take them off some day, and give them away in the street.
      Have you got any money? [She feels in his coat, and he his trousers&mdash;they
      find nothing.] Do you know that your pockets are one enormous hole?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Spiritually.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! Ah! H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Severely.] Now, look here, Daddy! [She takes him by his lapels.]
      Don't imagine that it isn't the most disgusting luxury on your part to go
      on giving away things as you do! You know what you really are, I suppose&mdash;a
      sickly sentimentalist!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Breaking away from her, disturbed.] It isn't sentiment. It's
      simply that they seem to me so&mdash;so&mdash;jolly. If I'm to give up
      feeling sort of&mdash;nice in here [he touches his chest] about people&mdash;it
      doesn't matter who they are&mdash;then I don't know what I'm to do. I
      shall have to sit with my head in a bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. I think you ought to.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I suppose they see I like them&mdash;then they tell me things.
      After that, of course you can't help doing what you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Well, if you will love them up!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear, I don't want to. It isn't them especially&mdash;why, I
      feel it even with old Calway sometimes. It's only Providence that he
      doesn't want anything of me&mdash;except to make me like himself&mdash;confound
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Moving towards the door into the house&mdash;impressively.] What you
      don't see is that other people aren't a bit like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. It's so old-fashioned too! I'm going to bed&mdash;I just leave you to
      your conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Opening the door-severely.] Good-night&mdash;[with a certain
      weakening] you old&mdash;Daddy!
    </p>

      he walks away, he sights the opposite door.] Well&mdash;damn it, what
      could I have done? Not a farthing on me! [He goes to the street door to

        pardon!" WELLWYN recoils spasmodically. A figure moves from the
        lamp-post to the doorway. He is seen to be young and to have ragged
        clothes. He speaks again: "You do not remember me, Monsieur? My name is
        Ferrand&mdash;it was in Paris, in the Champs-Elysees&mdash;by the
        fountain.... When you came to the door, Monsieur&mdash;I am not made of
        iron.... Tenez, here is your card I have never lost it." He holds out to
        WELLWYN an old and dirty wing card. As inch by inch he has advanced into
        the doorway, the light from within falls on him, a tall gaunt young
        pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of beard, a long
        ironical nose a little to one side, and large, grey, rather prominent
        eyes. There is a certain grace in his figure and movements; his clothes
        are nearly dropping off him.]

    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Yielding to a pleasant memory.] Ah! yes. By the fountain. I was
      sitting there, and you came and ate a roll, and drank the water.

    <p>
      FERRAND. [With faint eagerness.] My breakfast. I was in poverty&mdash;
      veree bad off. You gave me ten francs. I thought I had a little the right

      WELLWYN. [Sympathetically.] No. [Yielding to memory.] We talked
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. I have not yet changed my opinion. We other vagabonds, we are
      exploited by the bourgeois. This is always my idea, Monsieur.

    <p>
      WELLWYN. Yes&mdash;not quite the general view, perhaps! Well&mdash;&mdash;
      [Heartily.] Come in! Very glad to see you again.

      FERRAND. [Brushing his arms over his eyes.] Pardon, Monsieur&mdash;your
      goodness&mdash;I am a little weak. [He opens his coat, and shows a belt
      drawn very tight over his ragged shirt.] I tighten him one hole for each
      meal, during two days now. That gives you courage.

      of this. It'll buck you up. [He watches the young man drink.]

      FERRAND. [Becoming a size larger.] Sometimes I think that I will never
      succeed to dominate my life, Monsieur&mdash;though I have no vices, except
      that I guard always the aspiration to achieve success. But I will not roll
      myself under the machine of existence to gain a nothing every day. I must
      find with what to fly a little.

      one must always try, Monsieur; one must never be content. [Refusing the
      cake.] 'Grand merci', but for the moment I have no stomach&mdash;I have
      lost my stomach now for two days. If I could smoke, Monsieur! [He makes
      the gesture of smoking.]

    <p>
      WELLWYN. Rather! [Handing his tobacco pouch.] Roll yourself one.

    <p>
      FERRAND. [Rapidly rolling a cigarette.] If I had not found you, Monsieur&mdash;I
      would have been a little hole in the river to-night&mdash; I was so
      discouraged. [He inhales and puffs a long luxurious whif of smoke. Very
      bitterly.] Life! [He disperses the puff of smoke with his finger, and
      stares before him.] And to think that in a few minutes HE will be born!
      Monsieur! [He gazes intently at WELLWYN.] The world would reproach you for
      your goodness to me.

    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Looking uneasily at the door into the house.] You think so? Ah!

    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, if HE himself were on earth now, there would be a
      little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call Him
      sloppee sentimentalist! And what is veree funny, these gentlemen they
      would all be most strong Christians. [He regards WELLWYN deeply.] But that
      will not trouble you, Monsieur; I saw well from the first that you are no
      Christian. You have so kind a face.

    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, really, I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. To be froze to death&mdash;I mean&mdash;it's awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Puzzled and unhappy.] Well&mdash;come in a moment, and let's&mdash;
      think it out. Have some tea!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He pours out the remains of the tea, and finding there is not very
        much, adds rum rather liberally. TIMSON, who walks a little wide at the
        knees, steadying his gait, has followed.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Receiving the drink.] Yer 'ealth. 'Ere's&mdash;soberiety! [He
      applies the drink to his lips with shaking hand. Agreeably surprised.]
      Blimey! Thish yer tea's foreign, ain't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Reappearing from behind the screen in his new clothes of which
      the trousers stop too soon.] With a needle, Monsieur, I would soon have
      with what to make face against the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Too short! Ah!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He goes to the dais on which stands ANN's workbasket, and takes from it
        a needle and cotton.] [While he is so engaged FERRAND is sizing up old
        TIMSON, as one dog will another. The old man, glass in hand, seems to
        have lapsed into coma.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Indicating TIMSON] Monsieur!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He makes the gesture of one drinking, and shakes his head.]
      </p>

    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Handing him the needle and cotton.] Um! Afraid so!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They approach TIMSON, who takes no notice.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Gently.] It is an old cabby, is it not, Monsieur? 'Ceux sont
      tous des buveurs'.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Concerned at the old man's stupefaction.] Now, my old friend,
      sit down a moment. [They manoeuvre TIMSON to the settle.] Will you smoke?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [In a drowsy voice.] Thank 'ee-smoke pipe of 'baccer. Old 'orse&mdash;standin'
      abaht in th' cold.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He relapses into coma.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [With a click of his tongue.] 'Il est parti'.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Doubtfully.] He hasn't really left a horse outside, do you
      think?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Non, non, Monsieur&mdash;no 'orse. He is dreaming. I know very
      well that state of him&mdash;that catches you sometimes. It is the warmth
      sudden on the stomach. He will speak no more sense to-night. At the most,
      drink, and fly a little in his past.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Poor old buffer!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Touching, is it not, Monsieur? There are many brave gents among
      the old cabbies&mdash;they have philosophy&mdash;that comes from 'orses,
      and from sitting still.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Touching TIMSON's shoulder.] Drenched!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. That will do 'im no 'arm, Monsieur-no 'arm at all. He is well wet
      inside, remember&mdash;it is Christmas to-morrow. Put him a rug, if you
      will, he will soon steam.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WELLWYN takes up ANN's long red cloak, and wraps it round the old man.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Faintly roused.] Tha's right. Put&mdash;the rug on th' old 'orse.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He makes a strange noise, and works his head and tongue.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Alarmed.] What's the matter with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. It is nothing, Monsieur; for the moment he thinks 'imself a
      'orse. 'Il joue "cache-cache,"' 'ide and seek, with what you call&mdash;
      'is bitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. But what's to be done with him? One can't turn him out in this
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. If you wish to leave him 'ere, Monsieur, have no fear. I charge
      myself with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! [Dubiously.] You&mdash;er&mdash;I really don't know, I&mdash;hadn't
      contemplated&mdash;You think you could manage if I&mdash;if I went to bed?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. But certainly, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Still dubiously.] You&mdash;you're sure you've everything you
      want?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Bowing.] 'Mais oui, Monsieur'.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I don't know what I can do by staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. There is nothing you can do, Monsieur. Have confidence in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well-keep the fire up quietly&mdash;very quietly. You'd better
      take this coat of mine, too. You'll find it precious cold, I expect, about
      three o'clock. [He hands FERRAND his Ulster.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Taking it.] I shall sleep in praying for you, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ah! Yes! Thanks! Well-good-night! By the way, I shall be down
      rather early. Have to think of my household a bit, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. 'Tres bien, Monsieur'. I comprehend. One must well be regular in
      this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With a start.] Lord! [He looks at the door of the model's room.]
      I'd forgotten&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Can I undertake anything, Monsieur?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. No, no! [He goes to the electric light switch by the outer door.]
      You won't want this, will you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. 'Merci, Monsieur'.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WELLWYN switches off the light.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. 'Bon soir, Monsieur'!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. The devil! Er&mdash;good-night!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He hesitates, rumples his hair, and passes rather suddenly away.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [To himself.] Poor pigeon! [Looking long at old TIMSON] 'Espece
      de type anglais!'
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He sits down in the firelight, curls up a foot on his knee, and taking
        out a knife, rips the stitching of a turned-up end of trouser, pinches
        the cloth double, and puts in the preliminary stitch of a new hem&mdash;all
        with the swiftness of one well-accustomed. Then, as if hearing a sound
        behind him, he gets up quickly and slips behind the screen. MRS. MEGAN,
        attracted by the cessation of voices, has opened the door, and is
        creeping from the model's room towards the fire. She has almost reached
        it before she takes in the torpid crimson figure of old TIMSON. She
        halts and puts her hand to her chest&mdash;a queer figure in the
        firelight, garbed in the canary-coloured bath gown and rabbit's-wool
        slippers, her black matted hair straggling down on her neck. Having
        quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of stupor, MRS.
        MEGAN goes close to the fire, and sits on the little stool, smiling
        sideways at old TIMSON. FERRAND, coming quietly up behind, examines her
        from above, drooping his long nose as if enquiring with it as to her
        condition in life; then he steps back a yard or two.]

      FERRAND. [Gently.] 'Pardon, Ma'moiselle'.

    <p>
      FERRAND. All right, all right! We are brave gents!

    <p>
      TIMSON. [Faintly roused.] 'Old up, there!

      FERRAND. Trust in me, Ma'moiselle!

    <p>
      FERRAND. [Gently.] We must be good comrades. This asylum&mdash;it is
      better than a doss-'ouse.

        reassured, MRS. MEGAN again sits down.]

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. You frightened me.

    <p>
      TIMSON. [Unexpectedly-in a drowsy tone.] Purple foreigners!

    <p>
      FERRAND. Pay no attention, Ma'moiselle. He is a philosopher.

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Oh! I thought 'e was boozed.

    <p>
      FERRAND. It is the same-veree 'armless.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. What's that he's got on 'im?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. It is a coronation robe. Have no fear, Ma'moiselle. Veree docile
      potentate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I wouldn't be afraid of him. [Challenging FERRAND.] I'm afraid
      o' you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. It is because you do not know me, Ma'moiselle. You are wrong, it
      is always the unknown you should love.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I don't like the way you-speaks to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Ah! You are a Princess in disguise?

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. No fear!

      FERRAND. No? What is it then you do to make face against the necessities
      of life? A living?

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Sells flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Rolling his eyes.] It is not a career.

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [With a touch of devilry.] You don't know what I do.

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. What do you do for a livin'?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. I am an interpreter.

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. You ain't very busy, are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [With dignity.] At present I am resting.

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Looking at him and smiling.] How did you and 'im come here?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Ma'moiselle, we would ask you the same question.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. The gentleman let me. 'E's funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. 'C'est un ange' [At MRS. MEGAN's blank stare he interprets.] An
      angel!

      MRS. MEGAN. Me luck's out-that's why I come.

    <p>
      FERRAND. [Rising.] Ah! Ma'moiselle! Luck! There is the little God who
      dominates us all. Look at this old! [He points to TIMSON.] He is finished.
      In his day that old would be doing good business. He could afford himself&mdash;[He
      maker a sign of drinking.]&mdash;Then come the motor cars. All goes&mdash;he
      has nothing left, only 'is 'abits of a 'cocher'! Luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [With a vague gesture&mdash;drowsily.] Kick the foreign beggars
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. A real Englishman.... And look at me! My father was merchant of
      ostrich feathers in Brussels. If I had been content to go in his business,
      I would 'ave been rich. But I was born to roll&mdash;"rolling stone" to
      voyage is stronger than myself. Luck!... And you, Ma'moiselle, shall I
      tell your fortune? [He looks in her face.] You were born for 'la joie de
      vivre'&mdash;to drink the wines of life. 'Et vous voila'! Luck!
    </p>

    <p>
      FERRAND. Yes. You were born loving pleasure. Is it not? You see, you
      cannot say, No. All of us, we have our fates. Give me your hand. [He
      kneels down and takes her hand.] In each of us there is that against which
      we cannot struggle. Yes, yes!

        a crash.]

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Let go my hand, please!

    <p>
      FERRAND. [Relinquishing it, and staring into the fore gravely.] There is
      one thing I have never done&mdash;'urt a woman&mdash;that is hardly in my
      character. [Then, drawing a little closer, he looks into her face.] Tell
      me, Ma'moiselle, what is it you think of all day long?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I dunno&mdash;lots, I thinks of.

    <p>
      FERRAND. Shall I tell you? [Her eyes remain fixed on his, the strangeness
      of him preventing her from telling him to "get along." He goes on in his
      ironic voice.] It is of the streets&mdash;the lights&mdash; the faces&mdash;it
      is of all which moves, and is warm&mdash;it is of colour&mdash;it is [he
      brings his face quite close to hers] of Love. That is for you what the
      road is for me. That is for you what the rum is for that old&mdash;[He
      jerks his thumb back at TIMSON. Then bending swiftly forward to the girl.]

        from the house in a blue dressing-gown, with her hair loose, and a
        candle held high above her head. Taking in the strange half-circle round
        the stove, she recoils. Then, standing her ground, calls in a voice
        sharpened by fright: "Daddy&mdash;Daddy!"]

      ACT II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is four o'clock in the afternoon of New Year's Day. On the raised dais
      MRS. MEGAN is standing, in her rags; with bare feet and ankles, her dark
      hair as if blown about, her lips parted, holding out a dishevelled bunch
      of violets. Before his easel, WELLWYN is painting her. Behind him, at a
      table between the cupboard and the door to the model's room, TIMSON is
      washing brushes, with the movements of one employed upon relief works. The
      samovar is hissing on the table by the stove, the tea things are set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Open your mouth.

      WELLWYN. Oh! [He also looks at MRS. MEGAN.]

      at the canvas. Then standing back, runs his hands through his hair and
      turns a painter's glance towards the skylight.] Dash! Light's gone! Off

      'orse, I could give yer satisfaction.

      have nothing better for you than this, at present.

      TIMSON. [Faintly waving the brushes.] Of course, if you can't afford it, I
      don't press you&mdash;it's only that I feel I'm not doing meself justice.
      [Confidentially.] There's just one thing, sir; I can't bear to see a
      gen'leman imposed on. That foreigner&mdash;'e's not the sort to 'ave about
      the place. Talk? Oh! ah! But 'e'll never do any good with 'imself. He's a
      alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Terrible misfortune to a fellow, Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. Don't you believe it, sir; it's his fault I says to the young lady
      yesterday: Miss Ann, your father's a gen'leman [with a sudden accent of
      hoarse sincerity], and so you are&mdash;I don't mind sayin' it&mdash;but,
      I said, he's too easy-goin'.

      TIMSON. Well, see that girl now! [He shakes his head.] I never did believe
      in goin' behind a person's back&mdash;I'm an Englishman&mdash;but
      [lowering his voice] she's a bad hat, sir. Why, look at the street she
      comes from!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! you know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. Lived there meself larst three years. See the difference a few
      days' corn's made in her. She's that saucy you can't touch 'er head.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Is there any necessity, Timson?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. Artful too. Full o' vice, I call'er. Where's 'er 'usband?

    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Gravely.] Come, Timson! You wouldn't like her to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [With dignity, so that the bottle in his pocket is plainly
      visible.] I'm a man as always beared inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With a well-directed smile.] So I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Curving himself round the bottle.] It's not for me to say nothing&mdash;but
      I can tell a gen'leman as quick as ever I can tell an 'orse.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Painting.] I find it safest to assume that every man is a
      gentleman, and every woman a lady. Saves no end of self-contempt. Give me
      the little brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Handing him the brush&mdash;after a considerable introspective
      pause.] Would yer like me to stay and wash it for yer again? [With great
      resolution.] I will&mdash;I'll do it for you&mdash;never grudged workin'
      for a gen'leman.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With sincerity.] Thank you, Timson&mdash;very good of you, I'm
      sure. [He hands him back the brush.] Just lend us a hand with this.
      [Assisted by TIMSON he pushes back the dais.] Let's see! What do I owe
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Reluctantly.] It so 'appens, you advanced me to-day's yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Then I suppose you want to-morrow's?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. Well, I 'ad to spend it, lookin' for a permanent job. When you've
      got to do with 'orses, you can't neglect the publics, or you might as well
      be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Quite so!
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. It mounts up in the course o' the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. It would. [Passing him a coin.] This is for an exceptional
      purpose&mdash;Timson&mdash;see. Not&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Touching his forehead.] Certainly, sir. I quite understand. I'm
      not that sort, as I think I've proved to yer, comin' here regular day
      after day, all the week. There's one thing, I ought to warn you perhaps&mdash;I

      not as if there wasn't plenty o' pigeons for 'im to pluck in 'is own

        his face and raised arms are plainly visible through the window, as he
        fortifies himself from his battle against the cold. FERRAND, having

      bourgeoisie, there is a little too much colour in my costume.

      hat somewhere.

      FERRAND. Ah! Monsieur, 'merci', but that I could not. It is scarcely in my
      character.

    <p>
      WELLWYN. True!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. I have been to merchants of wine, of tabac, to hotels, to
      Leicester Square. I have been to a Society for spreading Christian
      knowledge&mdash;I thought there I would have a chance perhaps as
      interpreter. 'Toujours meme chose', we regret, we have no situation for
      you&mdash;same thing everywhere. It seems there is nothing doing in this
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I've noticed, there never is.

      FERRAND. I was thinking, Monsieur, that in aviation there might be a
      career for me&mdash;but it seems one must be trained.

      WELLWYN. Afraid so, Ferrand.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Approaching the picture.] Ah! You are always working at this.
      You will have something of very good there, Monsieur. You wish to fix the
      type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation. 'C'est
      tres chic ca'! [WELLWYN manifests the quiet delight of an English artist
      actually understood.] In the figures of these good citizens, to whom she
      offers her flower, you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to
      catch and make tame the wild bird, that will surely die within. 'Tres
      gentil'! Believe me, Monsieur, you have there the greatest comedy of life!
      How anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good. [His voice
      changes.] For the wild birds it is not funny. There is in some human
      souls, Monsieur, what cannot be made tame.

    <p>
      WELLWYN. Come, Megan, you can see the old fellow's in Paradise.

    <p>
      BERTLEY. Do you credit such a&mdash;such an object?

    <p>
      BERTLEY. Gracious! But just now you were will&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      MEGAN. [Sardonically.] There wasn't nothing against me honour, then. Now
      you've took it away between you, cumin' aht with it like this. I don't
      want no more of 'er, and I'll want a good deal more of 'im; as 'e'll soon
      find.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Young people, this is very dreadful. [MRS. MEGAN lowers her arm a
      little, and looks at him over it.] Very sad!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Dropping her arm.] Megan's no better than what I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Come, come! Here's your home broken up! [MRS. MEGAN Smiles.
      Shaking his head gravely.] Surely-surely-you mustn't smile. [MRS. MEGAN
      becomes tragic.] That's better. Now, what is to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Believe me, Monsieur, I greatly regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. I'm glad to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. If I had foreseen this disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Is that your only reason for regret?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [With a little bow.] Any reason that you wish, Monsieur. I will
      do my possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I could get an unfurnished room if [she slides her eyes round
      at WELLWYN] I 'ad the money to furnish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. But suppose I can induce your husband to forgive you, and take
      you back?

    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Shaking her head.] 'E'd 'it me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. I said to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. That wouldn't make no difference. [With a flash at BERTLEY.]
      An' I ain't forgiven him!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. That is sinful.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I'm a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. My good child, what difference does that make?

    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, if I might interpret for her.

      some fresh stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Yes; yes; never mind the money. What I want to find in you both,
      is repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [With a flash up at him.] I can't get me livin' off of
      repentin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Now, now! Never say what you know to be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, her soul is very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. [Severely.] I do not know, sir, that we shall get any great
      assistance from your views. In fact, one thing is clear to me, she must
      discontinue your acquaintanceship at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Certainly, Monsieur. We have no serious intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. All the more shame to you, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, I see perfectly your point of view. It is very natural.
      [He bows and is silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I don't want'im hurt'cos o' me. Megan'll get his mates to belt

      MRS. MEGAN. 'Twasn't his fault.

      the square thing.

      FERRAND. [With dignity.] Monsieur, I feel that I am in the wrong. It was

      once that your hitty-missy cart-load of bricks regime&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HOXTON. Is a deuced sight better, sir, than your grand-motherly methods.
      What the old fellow wants is a shock! With all this socialistic
      molly-coddling, you're losing sight of the individual.

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the first of April&mdash;a white spring day of gleams and driving
      showers. The street door of WELLWYN's studio stands wide open, and, past
      it, in the street, the wind is whirling bits of straw and paper bags.
      Through the door can be seen the butt end of a stationary furniture van
      with its flap let down. To this van three humble-men in shirt sleeves and
      aprons, are carrying out the contents of the studio. The hissing samovar,
      the tea-pot, the sugar, and the nearly empty decanter of rum stand on the
      low round table in the fast-being-gutted room. WELLWYN in his ulster and
      soft hat, is squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire,
      staring into it, and smoking a hand-made cigarette. He has a moulting air.
      Behind him the humble-men pass, embracing busts and other articles of
      vertu.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHIEF H'MAN. [Stopping, and standing in the attitude of expectation.]
      We've about pinched this little lot, sir. Shall we take the&mdash;reservoir?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He indicates the samovar.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ah! [Abstractedly feeling in his pockets, and finding coins.]
      Thanks&mdash;thanks&mdash;heavy work, I'm afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'MAN. [Receiving the coins&mdash;a little surprised and a good deal
      pleased.] Thank'ee, sir. Much obliged, I'm sure. We'll 'ave to come back
      for this. [He gives the dais a vigorous push with his foot.] Not a
      fixture, as I understand. Perhaps you'd like us to leave these 'ere for a
      bit. [He indicates the tea things.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ah! do.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The humble-men go out. There is the sound of horses being started, and
        the butt end of the van disappears. WELLWYN stays on his stool, smoking
        and brooding over the fare. The open doorway is darkened by a figure.
        CANON BERTLEY is standing there.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. WELLWYN! [WELLWYN turns and rises.] It's ages since I saw you. No
      idea you were moving. This is very dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Yes, Ann found this&mdash;too exposed. That tall house in Flight
      Street&mdash;we're going there. Seventh floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Lift?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WELLWYN shakes his head.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Dear me! No lift? Fine view, no doubt. [WELLWYN nods.] You'll be
      greatly missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. So Ann thinks. Vicar, what's become of that little flower-seller
      I was painting at Christmas? You took her into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Not we&mdash;exactly! Some dear friends of ours. Painful subject!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Yes. She got the footman into trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Did she, now?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Disappointing. I consulted with CALWAY, and he advised me to try
      a certain institution. We got her safely in&mdash;excellent place; but,
      d'you know, she broke out three weeks ago. And since&mdash; I've heard [he
      holds his hands up] hopeless, I'm afraid&mdash;quite!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I thought I saw her last night. You can't tell me her address, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. [Shaking his head.] The husband too has quite passed out of my
      ken. He betted on horses, you remember. I'm sometimes tempted to believe
      there's nothing for some of these poor folk but to pray for death.

        cap. She wears a white wool jersey, and a loose silk scarf.]

    <p>
      BERTLEY. Ah! Ann. I was telling your father of that poor little Mrs.
      Megan.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Is she dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Worse I fear. By the way&mdash;what became of her accomplice?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. We haven't seen him since. [She looks searchingly at WELLWYN.] At
      least&mdash;have you&mdash;Daddy?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Rather hurt.] No, my dear; I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. And the&mdash;old gentleman who drank the rum?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. He got fourteen days. It was the fifth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Dear me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. When he came out he got more drunk than ever. Rather a score for
      Professor Calway, wasn't it?

      fellow.

    <p>
      ANN. Yes, they fell over him. The Professor got him into an Institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. He was perfectly sober all the time he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear, they only allow them milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Well, anyway, he was reformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ye-yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Terribly.] Daddy! You've been seeing him!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With dignity.] My dear, I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. How do you know, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Came across Sir Thomas on the Embankment yesterday; told me old
      Timso&mdash;had been had up again for sitting down in front of a brewer's
      dray.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, you see, as soon as he came out of the what d'you call 'em,
      he got drunk for a week, and it left him in low spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. Do you mean he deliberately sat down, with the intention&mdash;of&mdash;er?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Said he was tired of life, but they didn't believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. Rather a score for Sir Thomas! I suppose he'd told the Professor?
      What did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, the Professor said [with a quick glance at BERTLEY] he felt
      there was nothing for some of these poor devils but a lethal chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. [Shocked.] Did he really!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He has not yet caught WELLWYN' s glance.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. And Sir Thomas agreed. Historic occasion. And you, Vicar H'm!

    <p>
      ANN. [To herself.] Well, there isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTLEY. And yet! Some good in the old fellow, no doubt, if one could put
      one's finger on it. [Preparing to go.] You'll let us know, then, when
      you're settled. What was the address? [WELLWYN takes out and hands him a
      card.] Ah! yes. Good-bye, Ann. Good-bye, Wellyn. [The wind blows his hat
      along the street.] What a wind! [He goes, pursuing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Who has eyed the card askance.] Daddy, have you told those other two
      where we're going?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Which other two, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. The Professor and Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well, Ann, naturally I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Jumping on to the dais with disgust.] Oh, dear! When I'm trying to
      get you away from all this atmosphere. I don't so much mind the Vicar
      knowing, because he's got a weak heart&mdash;&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Preparing to go.] I'm going round now. But you must stay here till
      the van comes back. And don't forget you tipped the men after the first
      load.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! Yes, yes. [Uneasily.] Good sorts they look, those fellows!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Scrutinising him.] What have you done?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Nothing, my dear, really&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I&mdash;I rather think I may have tipped them twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Drily.] Daddy! If it is the first of April, it's not necessary to
      make a fool of oneself. That's the last time you ever do these ridiculous
      things. [WELLWYN eyes her askance.] I'm going to see that you spend your
      money on yourself. You needn't look at me like that! I mean to. As soon as
      I've got you away from here, and all&mdash;these&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Don't rub it in, Ann!

      sort of triumph.] Deeds, not words, Daddy!

      for any one&mdash;nor any one for me&mdash;all would go by, and I never of
      it&mdash;fame, and fortune, and peace, even the necessities of life, ever

    <p>
      FERRAND. [Speaking on into the fire.] And I saw, Monsieur, so plain, that
      I should be vagabond all my days, and my days short, I dying in the end
      the death of a dog. I saw it all in my fever&mdash; clear as that flame&mdash;there
      was nothing for us others, but the herb of death. [WELLWYN takes his arm
      and presses it.] And so, Monsieur, I wished to die. I told no one of my
      fever. I lay out on the ground&mdash;it was verree cold. But they would
      not let me die on the roads of their parishes&mdash;they took me to an
      Institution, Monsieur, I looked in their eyes while I lay there, and I saw
      more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that I should
      die, although they would not let me. Then Monsieur, naturally my spirit
      rose, and I said: "So much the worse for you. I will live a little more."
      One is made like that! Life is sweet, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Yes, Ferrand; Life is sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. That little girl you had here, Monsieur [WELLWYN nods.] in her
      too there is something of wild-savage. She must have joy of life. I have
      seen her since I came back. She has embraced the life of joy. It is not
      quite the same thing. [He lowers his voice.] She is lost, Monsieur, as a
      stone that sinks in water. I can see, if she cannot. [As WELLWYN makes a
      movement of distress.] Oh! I am not to blame for that, Monsieur. It had
      well begun before I knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Yes, yes&mdash;I was afraid of it, at the time.
    </p>

        [MRS. MEGAN turns silently, and slips away.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FEERRAND. I do my best for her, Monsieur, but look at me! Besides, I am
      not good for her&mdash;it is not good for simple souls to be with those
      who see things clear. For the great part of mankind, to see anything&mdash;is
      fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Even for you, it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. No, Monsieur. To be so near to death has done me good; I shall
      not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave. Since I saw
      you, Monsieur, I have been in three Institutions. They are palaces. One
      may eat upon the floor&mdash;though it is true&mdash;for Kings&mdash;they
      eat too much of skilly there. One little thing they lack&mdash;those
      palaces. It is understanding of the 'uman heart. In them tame birds pluck
      wild birds naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. They mean well.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Ah! Monsieur, I am loafer, waster&mdash;what you like&mdash;for
      all that [bitterly] poverty is my only crime. If I were rich, should I not
      be simply veree original, 'ighly respected, with soul above commerce,
      travelling to see the world? And that young girl, would she not be "that
      charming ladee," "veree chic, you know!" And the old Tims&mdash;good
      old-fashioned gentleman&mdash;drinking his liquor well. Eh! bien&mdash;what
      are we now? Dark beasts, despised by all. That is life, Monsieur. [He
      stares into the fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. We're our own enemies, Ferrand. I can afford it&mdash;you can't.
      Quite true!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Earnestly.] Monsieur, do you know this? You are the sole being
      that can do us good&mdash;we hopeless ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Shaking his head.] Not a bit of it; I'm hopeless too.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Eagerly.] Monsieur, it is just that. You understand. When we are
      with you we feel something&mdash;here&mdash;[he touches his heart.] If I
      had one prayer to make, it would be, Good God, give me to understand!
      Those sirs, with their theories, they can clean our skins and chain our
      'abits&mdash;that soothes for them the aesthetic sense; it gives them too
      their good little importance. But our spirits they cannot touch, for they
      nevare understand. Without that, Monsieur, all is dry as a parched skin of
      orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Don't be so bitter. Think of all the work they do!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, of their industry I say nothing. They do a good work
      while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old, and
      the good unfortunate deserving. Above all to the little children. But,
      Monsieur, when all is done, there are always us hopeless ones. What can
      they do with me, Monsieur, with that girl, or with that old man? Ah!
      Monsieur, we, too, 'ave our qualities, we others&mdash;it wants you
      courage to undertake a career like mine, or like that young girl's. We
      wild ones&mdash;we know a thousand times more of life than ever will those
      sirs. They waste their time trying to make rooks white. Be kind to us if
      you will, or let us alone like Mees Ann, but do not try to change our
      skins. Leave us to live, or leave us to die when we like in the free air.
      If you do not wish of us, you have but to shut your pockets and&mdash;your
      doors&mdash;we shall die the faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With agitation.] But that, you know&mdash;we can't do&mdash;now
      can we?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. If you cannot, how is it our fault? The harm we do to others&mdash;is
      it so much? If I am criminal, dangerous&mdash;shut me up! I would not pity
      myself&mdash;nevare. But we in whom something moves&mdash; like that
      flame, Monsieur, that cannot keep still&mdash;we others&mdash;we are not
      many&mdash;that must have motion in our lives, do not let them make us
      prisoners, with their theories, because we are not like them&mdash;it is
      life itself they would enclose! [He draws up his tattered figure, then
      bending over the fire again.] I ask your pardon; I am talking. If I could
      smoke, Monsieur!

    <p>
      FERRAND. The good God made me so that I would rather walk a whole month of
      nights, hungry, with the stars, than sit one single day making round
      business on an office stool! It is not to my advantage. I cannot help it
      that I am a vagabond. What would you have? It is stronger than me. [He
      looks suddenly at WELLWYN.] Monsieur, I say to you things I have never
      said.

      WELLWYN. There, there! Shivery? Like to walk up and down a little?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They begin walking together up and down.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Beastly when your head goes under?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Yes. It frightened me. I thought I wouldn't come up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. I know&mdash;sort of world without end, wasn't it? What did you
      think of, um?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I wished I 'adn't jumped&mdash;an' I thought of my baby&mdash;
      that died&mdash;and&mdash;[in a rather surprised voice] and I thought of
      d-dancin'.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Her mouth quivers, her face puckers, she gives a choke and a little
        sob.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Stopping and stroking her.] There, there&mdash;there!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [For a moment her face is buried in his sleeve, then she recovers
        herself.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Then 'e got hold o' me, an' pulled me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ah! what a comfort&mdash;um?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Yes. The water got into me mouth.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They walk again.] I wouldn't have gone to do it but for him. [She looks
        towards FERRAND.] His talk made me feel all funny, as if people wanted
        me to.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. My dear child! Don't think such things! As if anyone would&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Stolidly.] I thought they did. They used to look at me so
      sometimes, where I was before I ran away&mdash;I couldn't stop there, you
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Too cooped-up?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Yes. No life at all, it wasn't&mdash;not after sellin'
      flowers, I'd rather be doin' what I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Ah! Well-it's all over, now! How d'you feel&mdash;eh? Better?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Yes. I feels all right now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She sits up again on the little stool before the fire.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. No shivers, and no aches; quite comfy?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. That's a blessing. All well, now, Constable&mdash;thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Who has remained discreetly apart at the door-cordially.]
      First rate, sir! That's capital! [He approaches and scrutinises MRS.
      MEGAN.] Right as rain, eh, my girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Shrinking a little.] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. That's fine. Then I think perhaps, for 'er sake, sir, the
      sooner we move on and get her a change o' clothin', the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! don't bother about that&mdash;I'll send round for my daughter&mdash;we'll
      manage for her here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. Very kind of you, I'm sure, sir. But [with embarrassment] she
      seems all right. She'll get every attention at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. But I assure you, we don't mind at all; we'll take the greatest
      care of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Still more embarrassed.] Well, sir, of course, I'm thinkin' of&mdash;I'm
      afraid I can't depart from the usual course.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Sharply.] What! But-oh! No! No! That'll be all right, Constable!
      That'll be all right! I assure you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [With more decision.] I'll have to charge her, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Good God! You don't mean to say the poor little thing has got to
      be&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Consulting with him.] Well, sir, we can't get over the facts,
      can we? There it is! You know what sooicide amounts to&mdash; it's an
      awkward job.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Calming himself with an effort.] But look here, Constable, as a
      reasonable man&mdash;This poor wretched little girl&mdash;you know what
      that life means better than anyone! Why! It's to her credit to try and
      jump out of it!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The CONSTABLE shakes his head.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. You said yourself her best friends couldn't wish her better!
      [Dropping his voice still more.] Everybody feels it! The Vicar was here a
      few minutes ago saying the very same thing&mdash;the Vicar, Constable!
      [The CONSTABLE shakes his head.] Ah! now, look here, I know something of
      her. Nothing can be done with her. We all admit it. Don't you see? Well,
      then hang it&mdash;you needn't go and make fools of us all by&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Monsieur, it is the first of April.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [With a sharp glance at him.] Can't neglect me duty, sir;
      that's impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Look here! She&mdash;slipped. She's been telling me. Come,
      Constable, there's a good fellow. May be the making of her, this.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. I quite appreciate your good 'eart, sir, an' you make it very
      'ard for me&mdash;but, come now! I put it to you as a gentleman, would you
      go back on yer duty if you was me?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WELLWYN raises his hat, and plunges his fingers through and through his
        hair.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Well! God in heaven! Of all the d&mdash;-d topsy&mdash;turvy&mdash;!
      Not a soul in the world wants her alive&mdash;and now she's to be
      prosecuted for trying to be where everyone wishes her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. Come, sir, come! Be a man!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Throughout all this MRS. MEGAN has sat stolidly before the fire, but as
        FERRAND suddenly steps forward she looks up at him.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. Do not grieve, Monsieur! This will give her courage. There is
      nothing that gives more courage than to see the irony of things. [He
      touches MRS. MEGAN'S shoulder.] Go, my child; it will do you good.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. MEGAN rises, and looks at him dazedly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Coming forward, and taking her by the hand.] That's my good
      lass. Come along! We won't hurt you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. I don't want to go. They'll stare at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Comforting.] Not they! I'll see to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Very upset.] Take her in a cab, Constable, if you must &mdash;for
      God's sake! [He pulls out a shilling.] Here!
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Taking the shilling.] I will, sir, certainly. Don't think I
      want to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. No, no, I know. You're a good sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Comfortable.] Don't you take on, sir. It's her first try; they
      won't be hard on 'er. Like as not only bind 'er over in her own recogs.
      not to do it again. Come, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Trying to free herself from the policeman's cloak.] I want to
      take this off. It looks so funny.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [As she speaks the door is opened by ANN; behind whom is dimly seen the
        form of old TIMSON, still heading the curious persons.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANN. [Looking from one to the other in amazement.] What is it? What's
      happened? Daddy!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Out of the silence.] It is nothing, Ma'moiselle! She has failed
      to drown herself. They run her in a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Lend her your jacket, my dear; she'll catch her death.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANN, feeling MRS. MEGAN's arm, strips of her jacket, and helps her into
        it without a word.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CONSTABLE. [Donning his cloak.] Thank you. Miss&mdash;very good of you,
      I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MEGAN. [Mazed.] It's warm!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She gives them all a last half-smiling look, and Passes with the
        CONSTABLE through the doorway.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FERRAND. That makes the third of us, Monsieur. We are not in luck. To wish
      us dead, it seems, is easier than to let us die.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He looks at ANN, who is standing with her eyes fixed on her father.
        WELLWYN has taken from his pocket a visiting card.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [To FERRAND.] Here quick; take this, run after her! When they've
      done with her tell her to come to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERRAND. [Taking the card, and reading the address.] "No. 7, Haven House,
      Flight Street!" Rely on me, Monsieur&mdash;I will bring her myself to call
      on you. 'Au revoir, mon bon Monsieur'!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He bends over WELLWYN's hand; then, with a bow to ANN goes out; his
        tattered figure can be seen through the window, passing in the wind.
        WELLWYN turns back to the fire. The figure of TIMSON advances into the
        doorway, no longer holding in either hand a waterproof leg-piece.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [In a croaky voice.] Sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. What&mdash;you, Timson?
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. On me larst legs, sir. 'Ere! You can see 'em for yerself! Shawn't
      trouble yer long....
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [After a long and desperate stare.] Not now&mdash;TIMSON not now!
      Take this! [He takes out another card, and hands it to TIMSON] Some other
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIMSON. [Taking the card.] Yer new address! You are a gen'leman. [He
      lurches slowly away.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANN shuts the street door and sets her back against it. The rumble of
        the approaching van is heard outside. It ceases.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANN. [In a fateful voice.] Daddy! [They stare at each other.] Do you know
      what you've done? Given your card to those six rotters.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [With a blank stare.] Six?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANN. [Staring round the naked room.] What was the good of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. [Following her eyes&mdash;-very gravely.] Ann! It is stronger
      than me.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Without a word ANN opens the door, and walks straight out. With a heavy
        sigh, WELLWYN sinks down on the little stool before the fire. The three
        humble-men come in.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN. [In an attitude of expectation.] This is the larst of
      it, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. Oh! Ah! yes!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He gives them money; then something seems to strike him, and he
        exhibits certain signs of vexation. Suddenly he recovers, looks from one
        to the other, and then at the tea things. A faint smile comes on his
        face.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WELLWYN. You can finish the decanter.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He goes out in haste.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN. [Clinking the coins.] Third time of arskin'! April fool!
      Not 'arf! Good old pigeon!
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND HUMBLE-MAN. 'Uman being, I call 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN. [Taking the three glasses from the last packing-case,
      and pouring very equally into them.] That's right. Tell you wot, I'd never
      'a touched this unless 'e'd told me to, I wouldn't&mdash;not with 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND HUMBLE-MAN. Ditto to that! This is a bit of orl right! [Raising his
      glass.] Good luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD HUMBLE-MAN. Same 'ere!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Simultaneously they place their lips smartly against the liquor, and at
      once let fall their faces and their glasses.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN. [With great solemnity.] Crikey! Bill! Tea! .....'E's got

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
