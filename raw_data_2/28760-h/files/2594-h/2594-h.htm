      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the last day of May in the early &lsquo;nineties, about six o&rsquo;clock
      of the evening, old Jolyon Forsyte sat under the oak tree below the
      terrace of his house at Robin Hill. He was waiting for the midges to bite
      him, before abandoning the glory of the afternoon. His thin brown hand,
      where blue veins stood out, held the end of a cigar in its tapering,
      long-nailed fingers&mdash;a pointed polished nail had survived with him
      from those earlier Victorian days when to touch nothing, even with the
      tips of the fingers, had been so distinguished. His domed forehead, great
      white moustache, lean cheeks, and long lean jaw were covered from the
      westering sunshine by an old brown Panama hat. His legs were crossed; in
      all his attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance, as of an old man who
      every morning put eau de Cologne upon his silk handkerchief. At his feet
      lay a woolly brown-and-white dog trying to be a Pomeranian&mdash;the dog
      Balthasar between whom and old Jolyon primal aversion had changed into
      attachment with the years. Close to his chair was a swing, and on the
      swing was seated one of Holly&rsquo;s dolls&mdash;called &lsquo;Duffer
      Alice&rsquo;&mdash;with her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose
      buried in a black petticoat. She was never out of disgrace, so it did not
      matter to her how she sat. Below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank,
      stretched to the fernery, and, beyond that refinement, became fields,
      dropping to the pond, the coppice, and the prospect&mdash;&rsquo;Fine,
      remarkable&rsquo;&mdash;at which Swithin Forsyte, from under this very
      tree, had stared five years ago when he drove down with Irene to look at
      the house. Old Jolyon had heard of his brother&rsquo;s exploit&mdash;that
      drive which had become quite celebrated on Forsyte &lsquo;Change. Swithin!
      And the fellow had gone and died, last November, at the age of only
      seventy-nine, renewing the doubt whether Forsytes could live for ever,
      which had first arisen when Aunt Ann passed away. Died! and left only
      Jolyon and James, Roger and Nicholas and Timothy, Julia, Hester, Susan!
      And old Jolyon thought: &lsquo;Eighty-five! I don&rsquo;t feel it&mdash;except
      when I get that pain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His memory went searching. He had not felt his age since he had bought his
      nephew Soames&rsquo; ill-starred house and settled into it here at Robin
      Hill over three years ago. It was as if he had been getting younger every
      spring, living in the country with his son and his grandchildren&mdash;June,
      and the little ones of the second marriage, Jolly and Holly; living down
      here out of the racket of London and the cackle of Forsyte &lsquo;Change,&rsquo;
      free of his boards, in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play,
      with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and
      its twenty acres, and in ministering to the whims of Holly and Jolly. All
      the knots and crankiness, which had gathered in his heart during that long
      and tragic business of June, Soames, Irene his wife, and poor young
      Bosinney, had been smoothed out. Even June had thrown off her melancholy
      at last&mdash;witness this travel in Spain she was taking now with her
      father and her stepmother. Curiously perfect peace was left by their
      departure; blissful, yet blank, because his son was not there. Jo was
      never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays&mdash;an
      amiable chap; but women, somehow&mdash;even the best&mdash;got a little on
      one&rsquo;s nerves, unless of course one admired them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far-off a cuckoo called; a wood-pigeon was cooing from the first elm-tree
      in the field, and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the
      last mowing! The wind had got into the sou&rsquo; west, too&mdash;a
      delicious air, sappy! He pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his
      chin and cheek. Somehow, to-day, he wanted company&mdash;wanted a pretty
      face to look at. People treated the old as if they wanted nothing. And
      with the un-Forsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul, he
      thought: &lsquo;One&rsquo;s never had enough. With a foot in the grave one&rsquo;ll
      want something, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised!&rsquo; Down here&mdash;away
      from the exigencies of affairs&mdash;his grandchildren, and the flowers,
      trees, birds of his little domain, to say nothing of sun and moon and
      stars above them, said, &lsquo;Open, sesame,&rsquo; to him day and night.
      And sesame had opened&mdash;how much, perhaps, he did not know. He had
      always been responsive to what they had begun to call &lsquo;Nature,&rsquo;
      genuinely, almost religiously responsive, though he had never lost his
      habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view, however deeply they
      might move him. But nowadays Nature actually made him ache, he appreciated
      it so. Every one of these calm, bright, lengthening days, with Holly&rsquo;s
      hand in his, and the dog Balthasar in front looking studiously for what he
      never found, he would stroll, watching the roses open, fruit budding on
      the walls, sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the
      coppice, watching the water-lily leaves unfold and glisten, and the
      silvery young corn of the one wheat field; listening to the starlings and
      skylarks, and the Alderney cows chewing the cud, flicking slow their
      tufted tails; and every one of these fine days he ached a little from
      sheer love of it all, feeling perhaps, deep down, that he had not very
      much longer to enjoy it. The thought that some day&mdash;perhaps not ten
      years hence, perhaps not five&mdash;all this world would be taken away
      from him, before he had exhausted his powers of loving it, seemed to him
      in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon. If anything came
      after this life, it wouldn&rsquo;t be what he wanted; not Robin Hill, and
      flowers and birds and pretty faces&mdash;too few, even now, of those about
      him! With the years his dislike of humbug had increased; the orthodoxy he
      had worn in the &lsquo;sixties, as he had worn side-whiskers out of sheer
      exuberance, had long dropped off, leaving him reverent before three things
      alone&mdash;beauty, upright conduct, and the sense of property; and the
      greatest of these now was beauty. He had always had wide interests, and,
      indeed could still read The Times, but he was liable at any moment to put
      it down if he heard a blackbird sing. Upright conduct, property&mdash;somehow,
      they were tiring; the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him, only
      gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them. Staring
      into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and
      white flowers on the lawn, a thought came to him: This weather was like
      the music of &lsquo;Orfeo,&rsquo; which he had recently heard at Covent
      Garden. A beautiful opera, not like Meyerbeer, nor even quite Mozart, but,
      in its way, perhaps even more lovely; something classical and of the
      Golden Age about it, chaste and mellow, and the Ravogli &lsquo;almost
      worthy of the old days&rsquo;&mdash;highest praise he could bestow. The
      yearning of Orpheus for the beauty he was losing, for his love going down
      to Hades, as in life love and beauty did go&mdash;the yearning which sang
      and throbbed through the golden music, stirred also in the lingering
      beauty of the world that evening. And with the tip of his cork-soled,
      elastic-sided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog Balthasar,
      causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas; for though he was
      supposed to have none, nothing could persuade him of the fact. When he had
      finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his master&rsquo;s
      calf, and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the
      disturbing boot. And into old Jolyon&rsquo;s mind came a sudden
      recollection&mdash;a face he had seen at that opera three weeks ago&mdash;Irene,
      the wife of his precious nephew Soames, that man of property! Though he
      had not met her since the day of the &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; in his old
      house at Stanhope Gate, which celebrated his granddaughter June&rsquo;s
      ill-starred engagement to young Bosinney, he had remembered her at once,
      for he had always admired her&mdash;a very pretty creature. After the
      death of young Bosinney, whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become,
      he had heard that she had left Soames at once. Goodness only knew what she
      had been doing since. That sight of her face&mdash;a side view&mdash;in
      the row in front, had been literally the only reminder these three years
      that she was still alive. No one ever spoke of her. And yet Jo had told
      him something once&mdash;something which had upset him completely. The boy
      had got it from George Forsyte, he believed, who had seen Bosinney in the
      fog the day he was run over&mdash;something which explained the young
      fellow&rsquo;s distress&mdash;an act of Soames towards his wife&mdash;a
      shocking act. Jo had seen her, too, that afternoon, after the news was
      out, seen her for a moment, and his description had always lingered in old
      Jolyon&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&rsquo;wild and lost&rsquo; he had called her.
      And next day June had gone there&mdash;bottled up her feelings and gone
      there, and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped
      out in the night and vanished. A tragic business altogether! One thing was
      certain&mdash;Soames had never been able to lay hands on her again. And he
      was living at Brighton, and journeying up and down&mdash;a fitting fate,
      the man of property! For when he once took a dislike to anyone&mdash;as he
      had to his nephew&mdash;old Jolyon never got over it. He remembered still
      the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of Irene&rsquo;s
      disappearance. It had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that
      house to which she must have wandered back, when Jo saw her, wandered back
      for a moment&mdash;like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that
      news, &lsquo;Tragic death of an Architect,&rsquo; in the street. Her face
      had struck him very much the other night&mdash;more beautiful than he had
      remembered, but like a mask, with something going on beneath it. A young
      woman still&mdash;twenty-eight perhaps. Ah, well! Very likely she had
      another lover by now. But at this subversive thought&mdash;for married
      women should never love: once, even, had been too much&mdash;his instep
      rose, and with it the dog Balthasar&rsquo;s head. The sagacious animal
      stood up and looked into old Jolyon&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Walk?&rsquo; he
      seemed to say; and old Jolyon answered: &ldquo;Come on, old chap!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, as was their wont, they crossed among the constellations of
      buttercups and daisies, and entered the fernery. This feature, where very
      little grew as yet, had been judiciously dropped below the level of the
      lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and
      give the impression of irregularity, so important in horticulture. Its
      rocks and earth were beloved of the dog Balthasar, who sometimes found a
      mole there. Old Jolyon made a point of passing through it because, though
      it was not beautiful, he intended that it should be, some day, and he
      would think: &lsquo;I must get Varr to come down and look at it; he&rsquo;s
      better than Beech.&rsquo; For plants, like houses and human complaints,
      required the best expert consideration. It was inhabited by snails, and if
      accompanied by his grandchildren, he would point to one and tell them the
      story of the little boy who said: &lsquo;Have plummers got leggers,
      Mother? &lsquo;No, sonny.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then darned if I haven&rsquo;t
      been and swallowed a snileybob.&rsquo; And when they skipped and clutched
      his hand, thinking of the snileybob going down the little boy&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;red lane,&rsquo; his eyes would twinkle. Emerging from the fernery,
      he opened the wicket gate, which just there led into the first field, a
      large and park-like area, out of which, within brick walls, the vegetable
      garden had been carved. Old Jolyon avoided this, which did not suit his
      mood, and made down the hill towards the pond. Balthasar, who knew a
      water-rat or two, gambolled in front, at the gait which marks an oldish
      dog who takes the same walk every day. Arrived at the edge, old Jolyon
      stood, noting another water-lily opened since yesterday; he would show it
      to Holly to-morrow, when &lsquo;his little sweet&rsquo; had got over the
      upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunch&mdash;her little
      arrangements were very delicate. Now that Jolly had gone to school&mdash;his
      first term&mdash;Holly was with him nearly all day long, and he missed her
      badly. He felt that pain too, which often bothered him now, a little
      dragging at his left side. He looked back up the hill. Really, poor young
      Bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house; he would have done
      very well for himself if he had lived! And where was he now? Perhaps,
      still haunting this, the site of his last work, of his tragic love affair.
      Or was Philip Bosinney&rsquo;s spirit diffused in the general? Who could
      say? That dog was getting his legs muddy! And he moved towards the
      coppice. There had been the most delightful lot of bluebells, and he knew
      where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the
      trees, away out of the sun. He passed the cow-houses and the hen-houses
      there installed, and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings, making
      for one of the bluebell plots. Balthasar, preceding him once more, uttered
      a low growl. Old Jolyon stirred him with his foot, but the dog remained
      motionless, just where there was no room to pass, and the hair rose slowly
      along the centre of his woolly back. Whether from the growl and the look
      of the dog&rsquo;s stivered hair, or from the sensation which a man feels
      in a wood, old Jolyon also felt something move along his spine. And then
      the path turned, and there was an old mossy log, and on it a woman
      sitting. Her face was turned away, and he had just time to think: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
      trespassing&mdash;I must have a board put up!&rsquo; before she turned.
      Powers above! The face he had seen at the opera&mdash;the very woman he
      had just been thinking of! In that confused moment he saw things blurred,
      as if a spirit&mdash;queer effect&mdash;the slant of sunlight perhaps on
      her violet-grey frock! And then she rose and stood smiling, her head a
      little to one side. Old Jolyon thought: &lsquo;How pretty she is!&rsquo;
      She did not speak, neither did he; and he realized why with a certain
      admiration. She was here no doubt because of some memory, and did not mean
      to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that dog touch your frock,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      got wet feet. Come here, you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dog Balthasar went on towards the visitor, who put her hand down
      and stroked his head. Old Jolyon said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you at the opera the other night; you didn&rsquo;t notice me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a subtle flattery in that, as though she had added: &lsquo;Do you
      think one could miss seeing you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in Spain,&rdquo; he remarked abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      alone; I drove up for the opera. The Ravogli&rsquo;s good. Have you seen
      the cow-houses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he
      moved instinctively towards that bit of property, and she moved beside
      him. Her figure swayed faintly, like the best kind of French figures; her
      dress, too, was a sort of French grey. He noticed two or three silver
      threads in her amber-coloured hair, strange hair with those dark eyes of
      hers, and that creamy-pale face. A sudden sidelong look from the velvety
      brown eyes disturbed him. It seemed to come from deep and far, from
      another world almost, or at all events from some one not living very much
      in this. And he said mechanically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you living now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a little flat in Chelsea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not want to hear what she was doing, did not want to hear anything;
      but the perverse word came out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. It was a relief to know that. And it came into his mind that,
      but for a twist of fate, she would have been mistress of this coppice,
      showing these cow-houses to him, a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Alderneys,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;they give the best milk.
      This one&rsquo;s a pretty creature. Woa, Myrtle!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fawn-coloured cow, with eyes as soft and brown as Irene&rsquo;s own,
      was standing absolutely still, not having long been milked. She looked
      round at them out of the corner of those lustrous, mild, cynical eyes, and
      from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the
      straw. The scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of
      the cool cow-house; and old Jolyon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come up and have some dinner with me. I&rsquo;ll send you
      home in the carriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived a struggle going on within her; natural, no doubt, with her
      memories. But he wanted her company; a pretty face, a charming figure,
      beauty! He had been alone all the afternoon. Perhaps his eyes were
      wistful, for she answered: &ldquo;Thank you, Uncle Jolyon. I should like
      to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! Let&rsquo;s go up, then!&rdquo; And, preceded by the dog
      Balthasar, they ascended through the field. The sun was almost level in
      their faces now, and he could see, not only those silver threads, but
      little lines, just deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coin-like
      fineness&mdash;the special look of life unshared with others. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      take her in by the terrace,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make a
      common visitor of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do all day?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teach music; I have another interest, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work!&rdquo; said old Jolyon, picking up the doll from off the
      swing, and smoothing its black petticoat. &ldquo;Nothing like it, is
      there? I don&rsquo;t do any now. I&rsquo;m getting on. What interest is
      that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to help women who&rsquo;ve come to grief.&rdquo; Old Jolyon
      did not quite understand. &ldquo;To grief?&rdquo; he repeated; then
      realised with a shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant
      himself if he had used that expression. Assisting the Magdalenes of
      London! What a weird and terrifying interest! And, curiosity overcoming
      his natural shrinking, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What do you do for them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. I&rsquo;ve no money to spare. I can only give sympathy
      and food sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily old Jolyon&rsquo;s hand sought his purse. He said hastily:
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you get hold of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to a hospital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hospital! Phew!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of
      beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon straightened the doll. &ldquo;Beauty!&rdquo; he ejaculated:
      &ldquo;Ha! Yes! A sad business!&rdquo; and he moved towards the house.
      Through a French window, under sun-blinds not yet drawn up, he preceded
      her into the room where he was wont to study The Times and the sheets of
      an agricultural magazine, with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels, and
      the like, which provided Holly with material for her paint brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s in half an hour. You&rsquo;d like to wash your
      hands! I&rsquo;ll take you to June&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her looking round eagerly; what changes since she had last visited
      this house with her husband, or her lover, or both perhaps&mdash;he did
      not know, could not say! All that was dark, and he wished to leave it so.
      But what changes! And in the hall he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy Jo&rsquo;s a painter, you know. He&rsquo;s got a lot of
      taste. It isn&rsquo;t mine, of course, but I&rsquo;ve let him have his
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing very still, her eyes roaming through the hall and music
      room, as it now was&mdash;all thrown into one, under the great skylight.
      Old Jolyon had an odd impression of her. Was she trying to conjure
      somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all
      pearl-grey and silver? He would have had gold himself; more lively and
      solid. But Jo had French tastes, and it had come out shadowy like that,
      with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking,
      broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour. It was
      not his dream! Mentally he had hung this space with those gold-framed
      masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when
      quantity was precious. And now where were they? Sold for a song! That
      something which made him, alone among Forsytes, move with the times had
      warned him against the struggle to retain them. But in his study he still
      had &lsquo;Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to mount the stairs with her, slowly, for he felt his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the bathrooms,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and other
      arrangements. I&rsquo;ve had them tiled. The nurseries are along there.
      And this is Jo&rsquo;s and his wife&rsquo;s. They all communicate. But you
      remember, I expect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene nodded. They passed on, up the gallery and entered a large room with
      a small bed, and several windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is mine,&rdquo; he said. The walls were covered with the
      photographs of children and watercolour sketches, and he added doubtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are Jo&rsquo;s. The view&rsquo;s first-rate. You can see the
      Grand Stand at Epsom in clear weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was down now, behind the house, and over the &lsquo;prospect&rsquo;
      a luminous haze had settled, emanation of the long and prosperous day. Few
      houses showed, but fields and trees faintly glistened, away to a loom of
      downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country&rsquo;s changing,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;but
      there it&rsquo;ll be when we&rsquo;re all gone. Look at those thrushes&mdash;the
      birds are sweet here in the mornings. I&rsquo;m glad to have washed my
      hands of London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was close to the window pane, and he was struck by its mournful
      look. &lsquo;Wish I could make her look happy!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;A
      pretty face, but sad!&rsquo; And taking up his can of hot water he went
      out into the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is June&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; he said, opening the next door
      and putting the can down; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find everything.&rdquo;
      And closing the door behind her he went back to his own room. Brushing his
      hair with his great ebony brushes, and dabbing his forehead with eau de
      Cologne, he mused. She had come so strangely&mdash;a sort of visitation;
      mysterious, even romantic, as if his desire for company, for beauty, had
      been fulfilled by whatever it was which fulfilled that sort of thing. And
      before the mirror he straightened his still upright figure, passed the
      brushes over his great white moustache, touched up his eyebrows with eau
      de Cologne, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to let them know that I have a lady to dinner with me. Let
      cook do something extra, and tell Beacon to have the landau and pair at
      half-past ten to drive her back to Town to-night. Is Miss Holly asleep?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid thought not. And old Jolyon, passing down the gallery, stole on
      tiptoe towards the nursery, and opened the door whose hinges he kept
      specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without
      being heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Holly was asleep, and lay like a miniature Madonna, of that type which
      the old painters could not tell from Venus, when they had completed her.
      Her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks; on her face was perfect peace&mdash;her
      little arrangements were evidently all right again. And old Jolyon, in the
      twilight of the room, stood adoring her! It was so charming, solemn, and
      loving&mdash;that little face. He had more than his share of the blessed
      capacity of living again in the young. They were to him his future life&mdash;all
      of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted. There
      she was with everything before her, and his blood&mdash;some of it&mdash;in
      her tiny veins. There she was, his little companion, to be made as happy
      as ever he could make her, so that she knew nothing but love. His heart
      swelled, and he went out, stilling the sound of his patent-leather boots.
      In the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him: To think that children
      should come to that which Irene had told him she was helping! Women who
      were all, once, little things like this one sleeping there! &lsquo;I must
      give her a cheque!&rsquo; he mused; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t bear to think of
      them!&rsquo; They had never borne reflecting on, those poor outcasts;
      wounding too deeply the core of true refinement hidden under layers of
      conformity to the sense of property&mdash;wounding too grievously the
      deepest thing in him&mdash;a love of beauty which could give him, even
      now, a flutter of the heart, thinking of his evening in the society of a
      pretty woman. And he went downstairs, through the swinging doors, to the
      back regions. There, in the wine-cellar, was a hock worth at least two
      pounds a bottle, a Steinberg Cabinet, better than any Johannisberg that
      ever went down throat; a wine of perfect bouquet, sweet as a nectarine&mdash;nectar
      indeed! He got a bottle out, handling it like a baby, and holding it level
      to the light, to look. Enshrined in its coat of dust, that mellow
      coloured, slender-necked bottle gave him deep pleasure. Three years to
      settle down again since the move from Town&mdash;ought to be in prime
      condition! Thirty-five years ago he had bought it&mdash;thank God he had
      kept his palate, and earned the right to drink it. She would appreciate
      this; not a spice of acidity in a dozen. He wiped the bottle, drew the
      cork with his own hands, put his nose down, inhaled its perfume, and went
      back to the music room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was standing by the piano; she had taken off her hat and a lace
      scarf she had been wearing, so that her gold-coloured hair was visible,
      and the pallor of her neck. In her grey frock she made a pretty picture
      for old Jolyon, against the rosewood of the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her his arm, and solemnly they went. The room, which had been
      designed to enable twenty-four people to dine in comfort, held now but a
      little round table. In his present solitude the big dining-table oppressed
      old Jolyon; he had caused it to be removed till his son came back. Here in
      the company of two really good copies of Raphael Madonnas he was wont to
      dine alone. It was the only disconsolate hour of his day, this summer
      weather. He had never been a large eater, like that great chap Swithin, or
      Sylvanus Heythorp, or Anthony Thornworthy, those cronies of past times;
      and to dine alone, overlooked by the Madonnas, was to him but a sorrowful
      occupation, which he got through quickly, that he might come to the more
      spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar. But this evening was a
      different matter! His eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he
      spoke of Italy and Switzerland, telling her stories of his travels there,
      and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and
      grand-daughter because they knew them. This fresh audience was precious to
      him; he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round
      the fields of reminiscence. Himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive,
      he instinctively avoided fatiguing others, and his natural flirtatiousness
      towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman. He
      would have liked to draw her out, but though she murmured and smiled and
      seemed to be enjoying what he told her, he remained conscious of that
      mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination. He could not
      bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you, and chattered away;
      or hard-mouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did.
      There was only one quality in a woman that appealed to him&mdash;charm;
      and the quieter it was, the more he liked it. And this one had charm,
      shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those Italian hills and valleys he had
      loved. The feeling, too, that she was, as it were, apart, cloistered, made
      her seem nearer to himself, a strangely desirable companion. When a man is
      very old and quite out of the running, he loves to feel secure from the
      rivalries of youth, for he would still be first in the heart of beauty.
      And he drank his hock, and watched her lips, and felt nearly young. But
      the dog Balthasar lay watching her lips too, and despising in his heart
      the interruptions of their talk, and the tilting of those greenish glasses
      full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was just failing when they went back into the music-room. And,
      cigar in mouth, old Jolyon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play me some Chopin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the cigars they smoke, and the composers they love, ye shall know the
      texture of men&rsquo;s souls. Old Jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or
      Wagner&rsquo;s music. He loved Beethoven and Mozart, Handel and Gluck, and
      Schumann, and, for some occult reason, the operas of Meyerbeer; but of
      late years he had been seduced by Chopin, just as in painting he had
      succumbed to Botticelli. In yielding to these tastes he had been conscious
      of divergence from the standard of the Golden Age. Their poetry was not
      that of Milton and Byron and Tennyson; of Raphael and Titian; Mozart and
      Beethoven. It was, as it were, behind a veil; their poetry hit no one in
      the face, but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted,
      and melted up the heart. And, never certain that this was healthy, he did
      not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the
      music of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with
      pearl-grey, and old Jolyon, in an armchair, whence he could see her,
      crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar. She sat a few moments with
      her hands on the keys, evidently searching her mind for what to give him.
      Then she began and within old Jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure, not
      quite like anything else in the world. He fell slowly into a trance,
      interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at
      long intervals, and replacing it. She was there, and the hock within him,
      and the scent of tobacco; but there, too, was a world of sunshine
      lingering into moonlight, and pools with storks upon them, and bluish
      trees above, glowing with blurs of wine-red roses, and fields of lavender
      where milk-white cows were grazing, and a woman all shadowy, with dark
      eyes and a white neck, smiled, holding out her arms; and through air which
      was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cow&rsquo;s horn. He
      opened his eyes. Beautiful piece; she played well&mdash;the touch of an
      angel! And he closed them again. He felt miraculously sad and happy, as
      one does, standing under a lime-tree in full honey flower. Not live one&rsquo;s
      own life again, but just stand there and bask in the smile of a woman&rsquo;s
      eyes, and enjoy the bouquet! And he jerked his hand; the dog Balthasar had
      reached up and licked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Go on&mdash;more Chopin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to play again. This time the resemblance between her and &lsquo;Chopin&rsquo;
      struck him. The swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her playing too,
      and the Nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her eyes, the
      light on her hair, as of moonlight from a golden moon. Seductive, yes; but
      nothing of Delilah in her or in that music. A long blue spiral from his
      cigar ascended and dispersed. &lsquo;So we go out!&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;No more beauty! Nothing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Irene stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like some Gluck? He used to write his music in a sunlit
      garden, with a bottle of Rhine wine beside him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes. Let&rsquo;s have &lsquo;Orfeo.&rsquo;&rdquo; Round about
      him now were fields of gold and silver flowers, white forms swaying in the
      sunlight, bright birds flying to and fro. All was summer. Lingering waves
      of sweetness and regret flooded his soul. Some cigar ash dropped, and
      taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off, he inhaled a mingled scent
      as of snuff and eau de Cologne. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;Indian
      summer&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; and he said: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
      played me &lsquo;Che faro.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer; did not move. He was conscious of something&mdash;some
      strange upset. Suddenly he saw her rise and turn away, and a pang of
      remorse shot through him. What a clumsy chap! Like Orpheus, she of course&mdash;she
      too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory! And disturbed to
      the heart, he got up from his chair. She had gone to the great window at
      the far end. Gingerly he followed. Her hands were folded over her breast;
      he could just see her cheek, very white. And, quite emotionalized, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, my love!&rdquo; The words had escaped him
      mechanically, for they were those he used to Holly when she had a pain,
      but their effect was instantaneously distressing. She raised her arms,
      covered her face with them, and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age. The
      passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment, so unlike the
      control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before
      broken down in the presence of another being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there&mdash;there, there!&rdquo; he murmured, and putting
      his hand out reverently, touched her. She turned, and leaned the arms
      which covered her face against him. Old Jolyon stood very still, keeping
      one thin hand on her shoulder. Let her cry her heart out&mdash;it would do
      her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dog Balthasar, puzzled, sat down on his stern to examine them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window was still open, the curtains had not been drawn, the last of
      daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within;
      there was a scent of new-mown grass. With the wisdom of a long life old
      Jolyon did not speak. Even grief sobbed itself out in time; only Time was
      good for sorrow&mdash;Time who saw the passing of each mood, each emotion
      in turn; Time the layer-to-rest. There came into his mind the words:
      &lsquo;As panteth the hart after cooling streams&rsquo;&mdash;but they
      were of no use to him. Then, conscious of a scent of violets, he knew she
      was drying her eyes. He put his chin forward, pressed his moustache
      against her forehead, and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole
      body, as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops. She put his hand
      to her lips, as if saying: &ldquo;All over now! Forgive me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The kiss filled him with a strange comfort; he led her back to where she
      had been so upset. And the dog Balthasar, following, laid the bone of one
      of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion, he could think of
      nothing better than china; and moving with her slowly from cabinet to
      cabinet, he kept taking up bits of Dresden and Lowestoft and Chelsea,
      turning them round and round with his thin, veined hands, whose skin,
      faintly freckled, had such an aged look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought this at Jobson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;cost
      me thirty pounds. It&rsquo;s very old. That dog leaves his bones all over
      the place. This old &lsquo;ship-bowl&rsquo; I picked up at the sale when
      that precious rip, the Marquis, came to grief. But you don&rsquo;t
      remember. Here&rsquo;s a nice piece of Chelsea. Now, what would you say
      this was?&rdquo; And he was comforted, feeling that, with her taste, she
      was taking a real interest in these things; for, after all, nothing better
      composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come again; you must come to lunch, then I can show you
      these by daylight, and my little sweet&mdash;she&rsquo;s a dear little
      thing. This dog seems to have taken a fancy to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Balthasar, feeling that she was about to leave, was rubbing his side
      against her leg. Going out under the porch with her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get you up in an hour and a quarter. Take this for your
      protegees,&rdquo; and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand.
      He saw her brightened eyes, and heard her murmur: &ldquo;Oh! Uncle Jolyon!&rdquo;
      and a real throb of pleasure went through him. That meant one or two poor
      creatures helped a little, and it meant that she would come again. He put
      his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more. The carriage rolled
      away. He stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees, and
      thought: &lsquo;A sweet night! She...!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days of rain, and summer set in bland and sunny. Old Jolyon walked and
      talked with Holly. At first he felt taller and full of a new vigour; then
      he felt restless. Almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice, and
      walk as far as the log. &lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not there!&rsquo; he
      would think, &lsquo;of course not!&rsquo; And he would feel a little
      shorter, and drag his feet walking up the hill home, with his hand clapped
      to his left side. Now and then the thought would move in him: &lsquo;Did
      she come&mdash;or did I dream it?&rsquo; and he would stare at space,
      while the dog Balthasar stared at him. Of course she would not come again!
      He opened the letters from Spain with less excitement. They were not
      returning till July; he felt, oddly, that he could bear it. Every day at
      dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at where she had sat. She was not
      there, so he unscrewed his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventh afternoon he thought: &lsquo;I must go up and get some
      boots.&rsquo; He ordered Beacon, and set out. Passing from Putney towards
      Hyde Park he reflected: &lsquo;I might as well go to Chelsea and see her.&rsquo;
      And he called out: &ldquo;Just drive me to where you took that lady the
      other night.&rdquo; The coachman turned his broad red face, and his juicy
      lips answered: &ldquo;The lady in grey, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the lady in grey.&rdquo; What other ladies were there! Stodgy
      chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped before a small three-storied block of flats, standing
      a little back from the river. With a practised eye old Jolyon saw that
      they were cheap. &lsquo;I should think about sixty pound a year,&rsquo; he
      mused; and entering, he looked at the name-board. The name &lsquo;Forsyte&rsquo;
      was not on it, but against &lsquo;First Floor, Flat C&rsquo; were the
      words: &lsquo;Mrs. Irene Heron.&rsquo; Ah! She had taken her maiden name
      again! And somehow this pleased him. He went upstairs slowly, feeling his
      side a little. He stood a moment, before ringing, to lose the feeling of
      drag and fluttering there. She would not be in! And then&mdash;Boots! The
      thought was black. What did he want with boots at his age? He could not
      wear out all those he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistress at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say Mr. Jolyon Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, will you come this way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon followed a very little maid&mdash;not more than sixteen one
      would say&mdash;into a very small drawing-room where the sun-blinds were
      drawn. It held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and
      good taste. He stood in the middle, with his top hat in his hand, and
      thought: &lsquo;I expect she&rsquo;s very badly off!&rsquo; There was a
      mirror above the fireplace, and he saw himself reflected. An old-looking
      chap! He heard a rustle, and turned round. She was so close that his
      moustache almost brushed her forehead, just under her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was driving up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d look in
      on you, and ask you how you got up the other night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, seeing her smile, he felt suddenly relieved. She was really glad to
      see him, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the Park?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But while she was gone to put her hat on, he frowned. The Park! James and
      Emily! Mrs. Nicholas, or some other member of his precious family would be
      there very likely, prancing up and down. And they would go and wag their
      tongues about having seen him with her, afterwards. Better not! He did not
      wish to revive the echoes of the past on Forsyte &lsquo;Change. He removed
      a white hair from the lapel of his closely-buttoned-up frock coat, and
      passed his hand over his cheeks, moustache, and square chin. It felt very
      hollow there under the cheekbones. He had not been eating much lately&mdash;he
      had better get that little whippersnapper who attended Holly to give him a
      tonic. But she had come back and when they were in the carriage, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we go and sit in Kensington Gardens instead?&rdquo; and
      added with a twinkle: &ldquo;No prancing up and down there,&rdquo; as if
      she had been in the secret of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the carriage, they entered those select precincts, and strolled
      towards the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone back to your maiden name, I see,&rdquo; he said:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her hand under his arm: &ldquo;Has June forgiven me, Uncle
      Jolyon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered gently: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes; of course, why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I forgave you as soon as I saw how the land really lay.&rdquo;
      And perhaps he had; his instinct had always been to forgive the beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I never regretted&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t.
      Did you ever love very deeply, Uncle Jolyon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that strange question old Jolyon stared before him. Had he? He did not
      seem to remember that he ever had. But he did not like to say this to the
      young woman whose hand was touching his arm, whose life was suspended, as
      it were, by memory of a tragic love. And he thought: &lsquo;If I had met
      you when I was young I&mdash;I might have made a fool of myself, perhaps.&rsquo;
      And a longing to escape in generalities beset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s a queer thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fatal thing
      often. It was the Greeks&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;made love into a
      goddess; they were right, I dare say, but then they lived in the Golden
      Age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil adored them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil! The word jarred him, for suddenly&mdash;with his power to see all
      round a thing, he perceived why she was putting up with him like this. She
      wanted to talk about her lover! Well! If it was any pleasure to her! And
      he said: &ldquo;Ah! There was a bit of the sculptor in him, I fancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He loved balance and symmetry; he loved the whole-hearted way
      the Greeks gave themselves to art.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Balance! The chap had no balance at all, if he remembered; as for symmetry&mdash;clean-built
      enough he was, no doubt; but those queer eyes of his, and high cheek-bones&mdash;Symmetry?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re of the Golden Age, too, Uncle Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon looked round at her. Was she chaffing him? No, her eyes were
      soft as velvet. Was she flattering him? But if so, why? There was nothing
      to be had out of an old chap like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil thought so. He used to say: &lsquo;But I can never tell him
      that I admire him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! There it was again. Her dead lover; her desire to talk of him! And he
      pressed her arm, half resentful of those memories, half grateful, as if he
      recognised what a link they were between herself and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a very talented young fellow,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      hot; I feel the heat nowadays. Let&rsquo;s sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves covered
      them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon. A pleasure to sit there and
      watch her, and feel that she liked to be with him. And the wish to
      increase that liking, if he could, made him go on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he showed you a side of him I never saw. He&rsquo;d be at
      his best with you. His ideas of art were a little new&mdash;to me &ldquo;&mdash;he
      had stiffed the word &lsquo;fangled.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty.&rdquo; Old
      Jolyon thought: &lsquo;The devil he did!&rsquo; but answered with a
      twinkle: &ldquo;Well, I have, or I shouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here with
      you.&rdquo; She was fascinating when she smiled with her eyes, like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old. Phil
      had real insight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past, out of a
      longing to talk of her dead lover&mdash;not a bit; and yet it was precious
      to hear, because she pleased his eyes and heart which&mdash;quite true!&mdash;had
      never grown old. Was that because&mdash;unlike her and her dead lover, he
      had never loved to desperation, had always kept his balance, his sense of
      symmetry. Well! It had left him power, at eighty-four, to admire beauty.
      And he thought, &lsquo;If I were a painter or a sculptor! But I&rsquo;m an
      old chap. Make hay while the sun shines.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them, at the edge
      of the shadow from their tree. The sunlight fell cruelly on their pale,
      squashed, unkempt young faces. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re an ugly lot!&rdquo; said
      old Jolyon suddenly. &ldquo;It amazes me to see how&mdash;love triumphs
      over that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love triumphs over everything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young think so,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love has no age, no limit, and no death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that glow in her pale face, her breast heaving, her eyes so large and
      dark and soft, she looked like Venus come to life! But this extravagance
      brought instant reaction, and, twinkling, he said: &ldquo;Well, if it had
      limits, we shouldn&rsquo;t be born; for by George! it&rsquo;s got a lot to
      put up with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, removing his top hat, he brushed it round with a cuff. The great
      clumsy thing heated his forehead; in these days he often got a rush of
      blood to the head&mdash;his circulation was not what it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still sat gazing straight before her, and suddenly she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange enough that I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words of Jo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wild and lost&rsquo; came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;my son saw you for a moment&mdash;that
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your son? I heard a voice in the hall; I thought for a
      second it was&mdash;Phil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon saw her lips tremble. She put her hand over them, took it away
      again, and went on calmly: &ldquo;That night I went to the Embankment; a
      woman caught me by the dress. She told me about herself. When one knows
      that others suffer, one&rsquo;s ashamed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and horror stirred within old Jolyon, the horror of one who
      has never known a struggle with desperation. Almost against his will he
      muttered: &ldquo;Tell me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care whether I lived or died. When you&rsquo;re like
      that, Fate ceases to want to kill you. She took care of me three days&mdash;she
      never left me. I had no money. That&rsquo;s why I do what I can for them,
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But old Jolyon was thinking: &lsquo;No money!&rsquo; What fate could
      compare with that? Every other was involved in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had come to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; But Irene did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my name was Forsyte, I suppose? Or was it June who kept you
      away? How are you getting on now?&rdquo; His eyes involuntarily swept her
      body. Perhaps even now she was&mdash;! And yet she wasn&rsquo;t thin&mdash;not
      really!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! with my fifty pounds a year, I make just enough.&rdquo; The
      answer did not reassure him; he had lost confidence. And that fellow
      Soames! But his sense of justice stifled condemnation. No, she would
      certainly have died rather than take another penny from him. Soft as she
      looked, there must be strength in her somewhere&mdash;strength and
      fidelity. But what business had young Bosinney to have got run over and
      left her stranded like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must come to me now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for anything
      you want, or I shall be quite cut up.&rdquo; And putting on his hat, he
      rose. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and get some tea. I told that lazy chap to put
      the horses up for an hour, and come for me at your place. We&rsquo;ll take
      a cab presently; I can&rsquo;t walk as I used to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed that stroll to the Kensington end of the gardens&mdash;the
      sound of her voice, the glancing of her eyes, the subtle beauty of a
      charming form moving beside him. He enjoyed their tea at Ruffel&rsquo;s in
      the High Street, and came out thence with a great box of chocolates swung
      on his little finger. He enjoyed the drive back to Chelsea in a hansom,
      smoking his cigar. She had promised to come down next Sunday and play to
      him again, and already in thought he was plucking carnations and early
      roses for her to carry back to town. It was a pleasure to give her a
      little pleasure, if it WERE pleasure from an old chap like him! The
      carriage was already there when they arrived. Just like that fellow, who
      was always late when he was wanted! Old Jolyon went in for a minute to say
      good-bye. The little dark hall of the flat was impregnated with a
      disagreeable odour of patchouli, and on a bench against the wall&mdash;its
      only furniture&mdash;he saw a figure sitting. He heard Irene say softly:
      &ldquo;Just one minute.&rdquo; In the little drawing-room when the door
      was shut, he asked gravely: &ldquo;One of your protegees?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Now thanks to you, I can do something for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood, staring, and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so
      many in its time. The idea of her thus actually in contact with this
      outcast grieved and frightened him. What could she do for them? Nothing.
      Only soil and make trouble for herself, perhaps. And he said: &ldquo;Take
      care, my dear! The world puts the worst construction on everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was abashed by her quiet smile. &ldquo;Well then&mdash;Sunday,&rdquo;
      he murmured: &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her cheek forward for him to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said again; &ldquo;take care of yourself.&rdquo;
      And he went out, not looking towards the figure on the bench. He drove
      home by way of Hammersmith; that he might stop at a place he knew of and
      tell them to send her in two dozen of their best Burgundy. She must want
      picking-up sometimes! Only in Richmond Park did he remember that he had
      gone up to order himself some boots, and was surprised that he could have
      had so paltry an idea.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little spirits of the past which throng an old man&rsquo;s days had
      never pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy hours
      elapsing before Sunday came. The spirit of the future, with the charm of
      the unknown, put up her lips instead. Old Jolyon was not restless now, and
      paid no visits to the log, because she was coming to lunch. There is
      wonderful finality about a meal; it removes a world of doubts, for no one
      misses meals except for reasons beyond control. He played many games with
      Holly on the lawn, pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be
      ready to bowl to Jolly in the holidays. For she was not a Forsyte, but
      Jolly was&mdash;and Forsytes always bat, until they have resigned and
      reached the age of eighty-five. The dog Balthasar, in attendance, lay on
      the ball as often as he could, and the page-boy fielded, till his face was
      like the harvest moon. And because the time was getting shorter, each day
      was longer and more golden than the last. On Friday night he took a liver
      pill, his side hurt him rather, and though it was not the liver side,
      there is no remedy like that. Anyone telling him that he had found a new
      excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him, would have
      been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deep-set
      iron-grey eyes, which seemed to say: &lsquo;I know my own business best.&rsquo;
      He always had and always would.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday morning, when Holly had gone with her governess to church, he
      visited the strawberry beds. There, accompanied by the dog Balthasar, he
      examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen
      berries which were really ripe. Stooping was not good for him, and he
      became very dizzy and red in the forehead. Having placed the strawberries
      in a dish on the dining-table, he washed his hands and bathed his forehead
      with eau de Cologne. There, before the mirror, it occurred to him that he
      was thinner. What a &lsquo;threadpaper&rsquo; he had been when he was
      young! It was nice to be slim&mdash;he could not bear a fat chap; and yet
      perhaps his cheeks were too thin! She was to arrive by train at half-past
      twelve and walk up, entering from the road past Drage&rsquo;s farm at the
      far end of the coppice. And, having looked into June&rsquo;s room to see
      that there was hot water ready, he set forth to meet her, leisurely, for
      his heart was beating. The air smelled sweet, larks sang, and the Grand
      Stand at Epsom was visible. A perfect day! On just such a one, no doubt,
      six years ago, Soames had brought young Bosinney down with him to look at
      the site before they began to build. It was Bosinney who had pitched on
      the exact spot for the house&mdash;as June had often told him. In these
      days he was thinking much about that young fellow, as if his spirit were
      really haunting the field of his last work, on the chance of seeing&mdash;her.
      Bosinney&mdash;the one man who had possessed her heart, to whom she had given
      her whole self with rapture! At his age one could not, of course, imagine
      such things, but there stirred in him a queer vague aching&mdash;as it
      were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy; and a feeling, too, more
      generous, of pity for that love so early lost. All over in a few poor
      months! Well, well! He looked at his watch before entering the coppice&mdash;only
      a quarter past, twenty-five minutes to wait! And then, turning the corner
      of the path, he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time, on
      the log; and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit
      there alone for a couple of hours at least. Two hours of her society
      missed! What memory could make that log so dear to her? His face showed
      what he was thinking, for she said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Uncle Jolyon; it was here that I first knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; there it is for you whenever you like. You&rsquo;re
      looking a little Londony; you&rsquo;re giving too many lessons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That she should have to give lessons worried him. Lessons to a parcel of
      young girls thumping out scales with their thick fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you go to give them?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mostly Jewish families, luckily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon stared; to all Forsytes Jews seem strange and doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They love music, and they&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had better be, by George!&rdquo; He took her arm&mdash;his
      side always hurt him a little going uphill&mdash;and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see anything like those buttercups? They came like
      that in a night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes seemed really to fly over the field, like bees after the flowers
      and the honey. &ldquo;I wanted you to see them&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t let
      them turn the cows in yet.&rdquo; Then, remembering that she had come to
      talk about Bosinney, he pointed to the clock-tower over the stables:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he wouldn&rsquo;t have let me put that there&mdash;had no
      notion of time, if I remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, pressing his arm to her, she talked of flowers instead, and he knew
      it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best flower I can show you,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of
      triumph, &ldquo;is my little sweet. She&rsquo;ll be back from Church
      directly. There&rsquo;s something about her which reminds me a little of
      you,&rdquo; and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus,
      instead of saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about you which reminds
      me a little of her.&rdquo; Ah! And here she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly, followed closely by her elderly French governess, whose digestion
      had been ruined twenty-two years ago in the siege of Strasbourg, came
      rushing towards them from under the oak tree. She stopped about a dozen
      yards away, to pat Balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her
      mind. Old Jolyon, who knew better, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my darling, here&rsquo;s the lady in grey I promised you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly raised herself and looked up. He watched the two of them with a
      twinkle, Irene smiling, Holly beginning with grave inquiry, passing into a
      shy smile too, and then to something deeper. She had a sense of beauty,
      that child&mdash;knew what was what! He enjoyed the sight of the kiss
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Heron, Mam&rsquo;zelle Beauce. Well, Mam&rsquo;zelle&mdash;good
      sermon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For, now that he had not much more time before him, the only part of the
      service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church
      remained to him. Mam&rsquo;zelle Beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad
      in a black kid glove&mdash;she had been in the best families&mdash;and the
      rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask: &ldquo;Are you
      well-brrred?&rdquo; Whenever Holly or Jolly did anything unpleasing to her&mdash;a
      not uncommon occurrence&mdash;she would say to them: &ldquo;The little
      Tayleurs never did that&mdash;they were such well-brrred little children.&rdquo;
      Jolly hated the little Tayleurs; Holly wondered dreadfully how it was she
      fell so short of them. &lsquo;A thin rum little soul,&rsquo; old Jolyon
      thought her&mdash;Mam&rsquo;zelle Beauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon was a successful meal, the mushrooms which he himself had picked
      in the mushroom house, his chosen strawberries, and another bottle of the
      Steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality, and a
      conviction that he would have a touch of eczema to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking Turkish coffee. It was no
      matter of grief to him when Mademoiselle Beauce withdrew to write her
      Sunday letter to her sister, whose future had been endangered in the past
      by swallowing a pin&mdash;an event held up daily in warning to the
      children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten. At the foot of the
      bank, on a carriage rug, Holly and the dog Balthasar teased and loved each
      other, and in the shade old Jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar
      luxuriously savoured, gazed at Irene sitting in the swing. A light,
      vaguely swaying, grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon
      it, lips just opened, eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped. She
      looked content; surely it did her good to come and see him! The
      selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him, for he could still
      feel pleasure in the pleasure of others, realising that what he wanted,
      though much, was not quite all that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
      come down if you find it dull. But it&rsquo;s a pleasure to see you. My
      little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure, except yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated,
      and this reassured him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not humbug,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I never told a woman I admired her when I didn&rsquo;t. In fact I
      don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve told a woman I admired her, except my
      wife in the old days; and wives are funny.&rdquo; He was silent, but
      resumed abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She used to expect me to say it more often than I felt it, and
      there we were.&rdquo; Her face looked mysteriously troubled, and, afraid
      that he had said something painful, he hurried on: &ldquo;When my little
      sweet marries, I hope she&rsquo;ll find someone who knows what women feel.
      I shan&rsquo;t be here to see it, but there&rsquo;s too much
      topsy-turvydom in marriage; I don&rsquo;t want her to pitch up against
      that.&rdquo; And, aware that he had made bad worse, he added: &ldquo;That
      dog will scratch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Of what was she thinking, this pretty creature whose
      life was spoiled; who had done with love, and yet was made for love? Some
      day when he was gone, perhaps, she would find another mate&mdash;not so
      disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over. Ah! but her
      husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Soames never trouble you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. Her face had closed up suddenly. For all her softness
      there was something irreconcilable about her. And a glimpse of light on
      the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which,
      belonging to early Victorian civilisation&mdash;so much older than this of
      his old age&mdash;had never thought about such primitive things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a comfort,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can see the
      Grand Stand to-day. Shall we take a turn round?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the flower and fruit garden, against whose high outer walls peach
      trees and nectarines were trained to the sun, through the stables, the
      vinery, the mushroom house, the asparagus beds, the rosery, the
      summer-house, he conducted her&mdash;even into the kitchen garden to see
      the tiny green peas which Holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her
      finger, and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand. Many
      delightful things he showed her, while Holly and the dog Balthasar danced
      ahead, or came to them at intervals for attention. It was one of the
      happiest afternoons he had ever spent, but it tired him and he was glad to
      sit down in the music room and let her give him tea. A special little
      friend of Holly&rsquo;s had come in&mdash;a fair child with short hair
      like a boy&rsquo;s. And the two sported in the distance, under the stairs,
      on the stairs, and up in the gallery. Old Jolyon begged for Chopin. She
      played studies, mazurkas, waltzes, till the two children, creeping near,
      stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward,
      listening. Old Jolyon watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you dance, you two!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shyly, with a false start, they began. Bobbing and circling, earnest, not
      very adroit, they went past and past his chair to the strains of that
      waltz. He watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling
      towards those little dancers thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sweetest picture I&rsquo;ve seen for ages.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollee! Mais enfin&mdash;qu&rsquo;est-ce que tu fais la&mdash;danser,
      le dimanche! Viens, donc!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the children came close to old Jolyon, knowing that he would save
      them, and gazed into a face which was decidedly &lsquo;caught out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better the day, better the deed, Mam&rsquo;zelle. It&rsquo;s all my
      doing. Trot along, chicks, and have your tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when they were gone, followed by the dog Balthasar, who took every
      meal, he looked at Irene with a twinkle and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there we are! Aren&rsquo;t they sweet? Have you any little
      ones among your pupils?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, three&mdash;two of them darlings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon sighed; he had an insatiable appetite for the very young.
      &ldquo;My little sweet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is devoted to music; she&rsquo;ll
      be a musician some day. You wouldn&rsquo;t give me your opinion of her
      playing, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo; but he stifled the words
      &ldquo;to give her lessons.&rdquo; The idea that she gave lessons was
      unpleasant to him; yet it would mean that he would see her regularly. She
      left the piano and came over to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like, very much; but there is&mdash;June. When are they
      coming back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon frowned. &ldquo;Not till the middle of next month. What does
      that matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said June had forgiven me; but she could never forget, Uncle
      Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forget! She must forget, if he wanted her to.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as if answering, Irene shook her head. &ldquo;You know she couldn&rsquo;t;
      one doesn&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Always that wretched past! And he said with a sort of vexed finality:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked to her an hour or more, of the children, and a hundred little
      things, till the carriage came round to take her home. And when she had
      gone he went back to his chair, and sat there smoothing his face and chin,
      dreaming over the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper.
      He stayed for some minutes without writing, then rose and stood under the
      masterpiece &lsquo;Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.&rsquo; He was not
      thinking of that picture, but of his life. He was going to leave her
      something in his Will; nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of
      thought and memory. He was going to leave her a portion of his wealth, of
      his aspirations, deeds, qualities, work&mdash;all that had made that
      wealth; going to leave her, too, a part of all he had missed in life, by
      his sane and steady pursuit of wealth. All! What had he missed? &lsquo;Dutch
      Fishing Boats&rsquo; responded blankly; he crossed to the French window,
      and drawing the curtain aside, opened it. A wind had got up, and one of
      last year&rsquo;s oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardener&rsquo;s
      brooms, was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone
      terrace in the twilight. Except for that it was very quiet out there, and
      he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since. A bat went by. A
      bird uttered its last &lsquo;cheep.&rsquo; And right above the oak tree
      the first star shone. Faust in the opera had bartered his soul for some
      fresh years of youth. Morbid notion! No such bargain was possible, that
      was real tragedy! No making oneself new again for love or life or
      anything. Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you
      could, and leave it something in your Will. But how much? And, as if he
      could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the
      country night, he turned back and went up to the chimney-piece. There were
      his pet bronzes&mdash;a Cleopatra with the asp at her breast; a Socrates;
      a greyhound playing with her puppy; a strong man reining in some horses.
      &lsquo;They last!&rsquo; he thought, and a pang went through his heart.
      They had a thousand years of life before them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; Well! enough at all events to save her getting old
      before her time, to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible,
      and grey from soiling that bright hair. He might live another five years.
      She would be well over thirty by then. &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; She had
      none of his blood in her! In loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty
      years and more, ever since he married and founded that mysterious thing, a
      family, came this warning thought&mdash;None of his blood, no right to
      anything! It was a luxury then, this notion. An extravagance, a petting of
      an old man&rsquo;s whim, one of those things done in dotage. His real
      future was vested in those who had his blood, in whom he would live on
      when he was gone. He turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the
      old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds of
      cigars. And suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her grey dress,
      fragrant, soft, dark-eyed, graceful, looking up at him. Why! She cared
      nothing for him, really; all she cared for was that lost lover of hers.
      But she was there, whether she would or no, giving him pleasure with her
      beauty and grace. One had no right to inflict an old man&rsquo;s company,
      no right to ask her down to play to him and let him look at her&mdash;for
      no reward! Pleasure must be paid for in this world. &lsquo;How much?&rsquo;
      After all, there was plenty; his son and his three grandchildren would
      never miss that little lump. He had made it himself, nearly every penny;
      he could leave it where he liked, allow himself this little pleasure. He
      went back to the bureau. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to,&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;let them think what they like. I&rsquo;m going to!&rsquo;
      And he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; Ten thousand, twenty thousand&mdash;how much? If
      only with his money he could buy one year, one month of youth. And
      startled by that thought, he wrote quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR HERRING,&mdash;Draw me a codicil to this effect: &ldquo;I
      leave to my niece Irene Forsyte, born Irene Heron, by which name she now
      goes, fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty.&rdquo; &lsquo;Yours
      faithfully, &lsquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rsquo;
    </p>

      When he had sealed and stamped the envelope, he went back to the window
      and drew in a long breath. It was dark, but many stars shone now.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      He woke at half-past two, an hour which long experience had taught him
      brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts. Experience had also taught
      him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of
      such panic. On this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid
      momentum was that if he became ill, at his age not improbable, he would
      not see her. From this it was but a step to realisation that he would be
      cut off, too, when his son and June returned from Spain. How could he
      justify desire for the company of one who had stolen&mdash;early morning
      does not mince words&mdash;June&rsquo;s lover? That lover was dead; but
      June was a stubborn little thing; warm-hearted, but stubborn as wood, and&mdash;quite
      true&mdash;not one who forgot! By the middle of next month they would be
      back. He had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had
      come into what remained of his life. Darkness showed up to him absurdly
      clear the nature of his feeling. Admiration for beauty&mdash;a craving to
      see that which delighted his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preposterous, at his age! And yet&mdash;what other reason was there for
      asking June to undergo such painful reminder, and how prevent his son and
      his son&rsquo;s wife from thinking him very queer? He would be reduced to
      sneaking up to London, which tired him; and the least indisposition would
      cut him off even from that. He lay with eyes open, setting his jaw against
      the prospect, and calling himself an old fool, while his heart beat
      loudly, and then seemed to stop beating altogether. He had seen the dawn
      lighting the window chinks, heard the birds chirp and twitter, and the
      cocks crow, before he fell asleep again, and awoke tired but sane. Five
      weeks before he need bother, at his age an eternity! But that early
      morning panic had left its mark, had slightly fevered the will of one who
      had always had his own way. He would see her as often as he wished! Why
      not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitor&rsquo;s instead
      of writing about it; she might like to go to the opera! But, by train, for
      he would not have that fat chap Beacon grinning behind his back. Servants
      were such fools; and, as likely as not, they had known all the past
      history of Irene and young Bosinney&mdash;servants knew everything, and
      suspected the rest. He wrote to her that morning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR IRENE,&mdash;I have to be up in town to-morrow. If you
      would like to have a look in at the opera, come and dine with me quietly
      ....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But where? It was decades since he had dined anywhere in London save at
      his Club or at a private house. Ah! that new-fangled place close to Covent
      Garden....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have a line to-morrow morning to the Piedmont Hotel whether
      to expect you there at 7 o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure;
      for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was
      instinctively unpleasant to him; it was not seemly that one so old should
      go out of his way to see beauty, especially in a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey next day, short though it was, and the visit to his lawyer&rsquo;s,
      tired him. It was hot too, and after dressing for dinner he lay down on
      the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little. He must have had a sort of
      fainting fit, for he came to himself feeling very queer; and with some
      difficulty rose and rang the bell. Why! it was past seven! And there he
      was and she would be waiting. But suddenly the dizziness came on again,
      and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa. He heard the maid&rsquo;s voice
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ring, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, come here&rdquo;; he could not see her clearly, for the cloud
      in front of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not well, I want some sal volatile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Her voice sounded frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon made an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go. Take this message to my niece&mdash;a lady waiting
      in the hall&mdash;a lady in grey. Say Mr. Forsyte is not well&mdash;the
      heat. He is very sorry; if he is not down directly, she is not to wait
      dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, he thought feebly: &lsquo;Why did I say a lady in grey&mdash;she
      may be in anything. Sal volatile!&rsquo; He did not go off again, yet was
      not conscious of how Irene came to be standing beside him, holding
      smelling salts to his nose, and pushing a pillow up behind his head. He
      heard her say anxiously: &ldquo;Dear Uncle Jolyon, what is it?&rdquo; was
      dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand; then drew a
      long breath of smelling salts, suddenly discovered strength in them, and
      sneezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. How did you get
      here? Go down and dine&mdash;the tickets are on the dressing-table. I
      shall be all right in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her cool hand on his forehead, smelled violets, and sat divided
      between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! You are in grey!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Help me up.&rdquo;
      Once on his feet he gave himself a shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business had I to go off like that!&rdquo; And he moved very
      slowly to the glass. What a cadaverous chap! Her voice, behind him,
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t come down, Uncle; you must rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! A glass of champagne&rsquo;ll soon set me to rights.
      I can&rsquo;t have you missing the opera.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the journey down the corridor was troublesome. What carpets they had
      in these newfangled places, so thick that you tripped up in them at every
      step! In the lift he noticed how concerned she looked, and said with the
      ghost of a twinkle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty host.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its
      slipping under him; but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much
      better, and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude
      into her manner towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have liked you for a daughter,&rdquo; he said suddenly;
      and watching the smile in her eyes, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t get wrapped up in the past at your time of life;
      plenty of that when you get to my age. That&rsquo;s a nice dress&mdash;I
      like the style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made it myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! A woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her
      interest in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make hay while the sun shines,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and drink
      that up. I want to see some colour in your cheeks. We mustn&rsquo;t waste
      life; it doesn&rsquo;t do. There&rsquo;s a new Marguerite to-night; let&rsquo;s
      hope she won&rsquo;t be fat. And Mephisto&mdash;anything more dreadful
      than a fat chap playing the Devil I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did not go to the opera after all, for in getting up from dinner
      the dizziness came over him again, and she insisted on his staying quiet
      and going to bed early. When he parted from her at the door of the hotel,
      having paid the cabman to drive her to Chelsea, he sat down again for a
      moment to enjoy the memory of her words: &ldquo;You are such a darling to
      me, Uncle Jolyon!&rdquo; Why! Who wouldn&rsquo;t be! He would have liked
      to stay up another day and take her to the Zoo, but two days running of
      him would bore her to death. No, he must wait till next Sunday; she had
      promised to come then. They would settle those lessons for Holly, if only
      for a month. It would be something. That little Mam&rsquo;zelle Beauce
      wouldn&rsquo;t like it, but she would have to lump it. And crushing his
      old opera hat against his chest he sought the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove to Waterloo next morning, struggling with a desire to say:
      &lsquo;Drive me to Chelsea.&rsquo; But his sense of proportion was too
      strong. Besides, he still felt shaky, and did not want to risk another
      aberration like that of last night, away from home. Holly, too, was
      expecting him, and what he had in his bag for her. Not that there was any
      cupboard love in his little sweet&mdash;she was a bundle of affection.
      Then, with the rather bitter cynicism of the old, he wondered for a second
      whether it was not cupboard love which made Irene put up with him. No, she
      was not that sort either. She had, if anything, too little notion of how
      to butter her bread, no sense of property, poor thing! Besides, he had not
      breathed a word about that codicil, nor should he&mdash;sufficient unto
      the day was the good thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the victoria which met him at the station Holly was restraining the dog
      Balthasar, and their caresses made &lsquo;jubey&rsquo; his drive home. All
      the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and
      peaceful, reposing in the shade, while the long lingering sunshine
      showered gold on the lawns and the flowers. But on Thursday evening at his
      lonely dinner he began to count the hours; sixty-five till he would go
      down to meet her again in the little coppice, and walk up through the
      fields at her side. He had intended to consult the doctor about his
      fainting fit, but the fellow would be sure to insist on quiet, no
      excitement and all that; and he did not mean to be tied by the leg, did
      not want to be told of an infirmity&mdash;if there were one, could not
      afford to hear of it at his time of life, now that this new interest had
      come. And he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his
      son. It would only bring them back with a run! How far this silence was
      due to consideration for their pleasure, how far to regard for his own, he
      did not pause to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off,
      when he heard the rustle of a gown, and was conscious of a scent of
      violets. Opening his eyes he saw her, dressed in grey, standing by the
      fireplace, holding out her arms. The odd thing was that, though those arms
      seemed to hold nothing, they were curved as if round someone&rsquo;s neck,
      and her own neck was bent back, her lips open, her eyes closed. She
      vanished at once, and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes. But
      those bronzes and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was, only
      the fireplace and the wall! Shaken and troubled, he got up. &lsquo;I must
      take medicine,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be well.&rsquo; His
      heart beat too fast, he had an asthmatic feeling in the chest; and going
      to the window, he opened it to get some air. A dog was barking far away,
      one of the dogs at Gage&rsquo;s farm no doubt, beyond the coppice. A
      beautiful still night, but dark. &lsquo;I dropped off,&rsquo; he mused,
      &lsquo;that&rsquo;s it! And yet I&rsquo;ll swear my eyes were open!&rsquo;
      A sound like a sigh seemed to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart, he stepped
      out on the terrace. Something soft scurried by in the dark. &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;
      It was that great grey cat. &lsquo;Young Bosinney was like a great cat!&rsquo;
      he thought. &lsquo;It was him in there, that she&mdash;that she was&mdash;He&rsquo;s
      got her still!&rsquo; He walked to the edge of the terrace, and looked
      down into the darkness; he could just see the powdering of the daisies on
      the unmown lawn. Here to-day and gone to-morrow! And there came the moon,
      who saw all, young and old, alive and dead, and didn&rsquo;t care a dump!
      His own turn soon. For a single day of youth he would give what was left!
      And he turned again towards the house. He could see the windows of the
      night nursery up there. His little sweet would be asleep. &lsquo;Hope that
      dog won&rsquo;t wake her!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;What is it makes us
      love, and makes us die! I must go to bed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And across the terrace stones, growing grey in the moonlight, he passed
      back within.
    </p>
    <p>
      How should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his well-spent
      past? In that, at all events, there is no agitating warmth, only pale
      winter sunshine. The shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos
      of memory. The present he should distrust; the future shun. From beneath
      thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes. If there be
      sun of summer, let him not go out into it, mistaking it for the
      Indian-summer sun! Thus peradventure he shall decline softly, slowly,
      imperceptibly, until impatient Nature clutches his wind-pipe and he gasps
      away to death some early morning before the world is aired, and they put
      on his tombstone: &lsquo;In the fulness of years!&rsquo; yea! If he
      preserve his principles in perfect order, a Forsyte may live on long after
      he is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was conscious of all this, and yet there was in him that which
      transcended Forsyteism. For it is written that a Forsyte shall not love
      beauty more than reason; nor his own way more than his own health. And
      something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at
      the thinning shell. His sagacity knew this, but it knew too that he could
      not stop that beating, nor would if he could. And yet, if you had told him
      he was living on his capital, he would have stared you down. No, no; a man
      did not live on his capital; it was not done! The shibboleths of the past
      are ever more real than the actualities of the present. And he, to whom
      living on one&rsquo;s capital had always been anathema, could not have
      borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case. Pleasure is
      healthful; beauty good to see; to live again in the youth of the young&mdash;and
      what else on earth was he doing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodically, as had been the way of his whole life, he now arranged his
      time. On Tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train; Irene came and dined
      with him. And they went to the opera. On Thursdays he drove to town, and,
      putting that fat chap and his horses up, met her in Kensington Gardens,
      picking up the carriage after he had left her, and driving home again in
      time for dinner. He threw out the casual formula that he had business in
      London on those two days. On Wednesdays and Saturdays she came down to
      give Holly music lessons. The greater the pleasure he took in her society,
      the more scrupulously fastidious he became, just a matter-of-fact and
      friendly uncle. Not even in feeling, really, was he more&mdash;for, after
      all, there was his age. And yet, if she were late he fidgeted himself to
      death. If she missed coming, which happened twice, his eyes grew sad as an
      old dog&rsquo;s, and he failed to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so a month went by&mdash;a month of summer in the fields, and in his
      heart, with summer&rsquo;s heat and the fatigue thereof. Who could have
      believed a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his son&rsquo;s
      and his grand-daughter&rsquo;s return with something like dread! There was
      such a delicious freedom, such recovery of that independence a man enjoys
      before he founds a family, about these weeks of lovely weather, and this
      new companionship with one who demanded nothing, and remained always a
      little unknown, retaining the fascination of mystery. It was like a
      draught of wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has
      almost forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood, the narcotic to his
      brain. The flowers were coloured brighter, scents and music and the
      sunlight had a living value&mdash;were no longer mere reminders of past
      enjoyment. There was something now to live for which stirred him
      continually to anticipation. He lived in that, not in retrospection; the
      difference is considerable to any so old as he. The pleasures of the
      table, never of much consequence to one naturally abstemious, had lost all
      value. He ate little, without knowing what he ate; and every day grew
      thinner and more worn to look at. He was again a &lsquo;threadpaper&rsquo;.
      and to this thinned form his massive forehead, with hollows at the
      temples, gave more dignity than ever. He was very well aware that he ought
      to see the doctor, but liberty was too sweet. He could not afford to pet
      his frequent shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense
      of liberty. Return to the vegetable existence he had led among the
      agricultural journals with the life-size mangold wurzels, before this new
      attraction came into his life&mdash;no! He exceeded his allowance of
      cigars. Two a day had always been his rule. Now he smoked three and
      sometimes four&mdash;a man will when he is filled with the creative
      spirit. But very often he thought: &lsquo;I must give up smoking, and
      coffee; I must give up rattling up to town.&rsquo; But he did not; there
      was no one in any sort of authority to notice him, and this was a
      priceless boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants perhaps wondered, but they were, naturally, dumb. Mam&rsquo;zelle
      Beauce was too concerned with her own digestion, and too &lsquo;wellbrrred&rsquo;
      to make personal allusions. Holly had not as yet an eye for the relative
      appearance of him who was her plaything and her god. It was left for Irene
      herself to beg him to eat more, to rest in the hot part of the day, to
      take a tonic, and so forth. But she did not tell him that she was the
      cause of his thinness&mdash;for one cannot see the havoc oneself is
      working. A man of eighty-five has no passions, but the Beauty which
      produces passion works on in the old way, till death closes the eyes which
      crave the sight of Her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day of the second week in July he received a letter from his
      son in Paris to say that they would all be back on Friday. This had always
      been more sure than Fate; but, with the pathetic improvidence given to the
      old, that they may endure to the end, he had never quite admitted it. Now
      he did, and something would have to be done. He had ceased to be able to
      imagine life without this new interest, but that which is not imagined
      sometimes exists, as Forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost. He
      sat in his old leather chair, doubling up the letter, and mumbling with
      his lips the end of an unlighted cigar. After to-morrow his Tuesday
      expeditions to town would have to be abandoned. He could still drive up,
      perhaps, once a week, on the pretext of seeing his man of business. But
      even that would be dependent on his health, for now they would begin to
      fuss about him. The lessons! The lessons must go on! She must swallow down
      her scruples, and June must put her feelings in her pocket. She had done
      so once, on the day after the news of Bosinney&rsquo;s death; what she had
      done then, she could surely do again now. Four years since that injury was
      inflicted on her&mdash;not Christian to keep the memory of old sores
      alive. June&rsquo;s will was strong, but his was stronger, for his sands
      were running out. Irene was soft, surely she would do this for him, subdue
      her natural shrinking, sooner than give him pain! The lessons must
      continue; for if they did, he was secure. And lighting his cigar at last,
      he began trying to shape out how to put it to them all, and explain this
      strange intimacy; how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truth&mdash;that
      he could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty. Ah! Holly! Holly
      was fond of her, Holly liked her lessons. She would save him&mdash;his
      little sweet! And with that happy thought he became serene, and wondered
      what he had been worrying about so fearfully. He must not worry, it left
      him always curiously weak, and as if but half present in his own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness, though he did
      not faint. He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a
      fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous. When one grew
      old, the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom, and for what
      reason?&mdash;just to keep the breath in him a little longer. He did not
      want it at such cost. Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from
      that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink
      some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon felt
      able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still shaky next
      morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him. It was
      always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner&mdash;he suspected her of
      undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow
      and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn&rsquo;t much
      pleasure, and this was the last time he would be able to give her that
      treat. But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he
      had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion,
      too, of telling her about June&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera that evening was &lsquo;Carmen,&rsquo; and he chose the last
      entr&rsquo;acte to break the news, instinctively putting it off till the
      latest moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it quietly, queerly; in fact, he did not know how she had taken
      it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary.
      The mask was down over her face, that mask behind which so much went on
      that he could not see. She wanted time to think it over, no doubt! He
      would not press her, for she would be coming to give her lesson to-morrow
      afternoon, and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea.
      In the cab he talked only of the Carmen; he had seen better in the old
      days, but this one was not bad at all. When he took her hand to say
      good-night, she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon, you have been so sweet to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-night. Sleep well.&rdquo;
      She echoed softly: &ldquo;Sleep well&rdquo; and from the cab window,
      already moving away, he saw her face screwed round towards him, and her
      hand put out in a gesture which seemed to linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought his room slowly. They never gave him the same, and he could not
      get used to these &lsquo;spick-and-spandy&rsquo; bedrooms with new
      furniture and grey-green carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses. He
      was wakeful and that wretched Habanera kept throbbing in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His French had never been equal to its words, but its sense he knew, if it
      had any sense, a gipsy thing&mdash;wild and unaccountable. Well, there was
      in life something which upset all your care and plans&mdash;something
      which made men and women dance to its pipes. And he lay staring from
      deep-sunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway. You
      thought you had hold of life, but it slipped away behind you, took you by
      the scruff of the neck, forced you here and forced you there, and then,
      likely as not, squeezed life out of you! It took the very stars like that,
      he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, rubbed their noses together and flung them
      apart; it had never done playing its pranks. Five million people in this
      great blunderbuss of a town, and all of them at the mercy of that
      Life-Force, like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when
      you struck your fist on it. Ah, well! Himself would not hop much longer&mdash;a
      good long sleep would do him good!
    </p>
    <p>
      How hot it was up here!&mdash;how noisy! His forehead burned; she had
      kissed it just where he always worried; just there&mdash;as if she had
      known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him. But, instead,
      her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness. She had never spoken in
      quite that voice, had never before made that lingering gesture or looked
      back at him as she drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside; his room faced down over
      the river. There was little air, but the sight of that breadth of water
      flowing by, calm, eternal, soothed him. &lsquo;The great thing,&rsquo; he
      thought &lsquo;is not to make myself a nuisance. I&rsquo;ll think of my
      little sweet, and go to sleep.&rsquo; But it was long before the heat and
      throbbing of the London night died out into the short slumber of the
      summer morning. And old Jolyon had but forty winks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden, and with
      the help of Holly, who was very delicate with flowers, gathered a great
      bunch of carnations. They were, he told her, for &lsquo;the lady in grey&rsquo;&mdash;a
      name still bandied between them; and he put them in a bowl in his study
      where he meant to tackle Irene the moment she came, on the subject of June
      and future lessons. Their fragrance and colour would help. After lunch he
      lay down, for he felt very tired, and the carriage would not bring her
      from the station till four o&rsquo;clock. But as the hour approached he
      grew restless, and sought the schoolroom, which overlooked the drive. The
      sun-blinds were down, and Holly was there with Mademoiselle Beauce,
      sheltered from the heat of a stifling July day, attending to their
      silkworms. Old Jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical
      creatures, whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants; who nibbled
      such quantities of holes in nice green leaves; and smelled, as he thought,
      horrid. He sat down on a chintz-covered windowseat whence he could see the
      drive, and get what air there was; and the dog Balthasar who appreciated
      chintz on hot days, jumped up beside him. Over the cottage piano a violet
      dust-sheet, faded almost to grey, was spread, and on it the first
      lavender, whose scent filled the room. In spite of the coolness here,
      perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his
      ebbed-down senses. Each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying
      brilliance; that dog smelled very strong; the lavender perfume was
      overpowering; those silkworms heaving up their grey-green backs seemed
      horribly alive; and Holly&rsquo;s dark head bent over them had a
      wonderfully silky sheen. A marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when
      you were old and weak; it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms
      and its beating vitality. He had never, till those last few weeks, had
      this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in
      the stream of life, and with the other half left on the bank, watching
      that helpless progress. Only when Irene was with him did he lose this
      double consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly turned her head, pointed with her little brown fist to the piano&mdash;for
      to point with a finger was not &lsquo;well-brrred&rsquo;&mdash;and said
      slyly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the &lsquo;lady in grey,&rsquo; Gran; isn&rsquo;t she
      pretty to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s heart gave a flutter, and for a second the room was
      clouded; then it cleared, and he said with a twinkle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been dressing her up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mam&rsquo;zelle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollee! Don&rsquo;t be foolish!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That prim little Frenchwoman! She hadn&rsquo;t yet got over the music
      lessons being taken away from her. That wouldn&rsquo;t help. His little
      sweet was the only friend they had. Well, they were her lessons. And he
      shouldn&rsquo;t budge shouldn&rsquo;t budge for anything. He stroked the
      warm wool on Balthasar&rsquo;s head, and heard Holly say: &ldquo;When
      mother&rsquo;s home, there won&rsquo;t be any changes, will there? She
      doesn&rsquo;t like strangers, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of
      opposition about old Jolyon, and disclose all the menace to his new-found
      freedom. Ah! He would have to resign himself to being an old man at the
      mercy of care and love, or fight to keep this new and prized
      companionship; and to fight tired him to death. But his thin, worn face
      hardened into resolution till it appeared all Jaw. This was his house, and
      his affair; he should not budge! He looked at his watch, old and thin like
      himself; he had owned it fifty years. Past four already! And kissing the
      top of Holly&rsquo;s head in passing, he went down to the hall. He wanted
      to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson. At the first
      sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch, and saw at once that the
      victoria was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train&rsquo;s in, sir; but the lady &lsquo;asn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon gave him a sharp upward look, his eyes seemed to push away that
      fat chap&rsquo;s curiosity, and defy him to see the bitter disappointment
      he was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, and turned back into the house. He went
      to his study and sat down, quivering like a leaf. What did this mean? She
      might have lost her train, but he knew well enough she hadn&rsquo;t.
      &lsquo;Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon.&rsquo; Why &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; and
      not &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo;. And that hand of hers lingering in the air.
      And her kiss. What did it mean? Vehement alarm and irritation took
      possession of him. He got up and began to pace the Turkey carpet, between
      window and wall. She was going to give him up! He felt it for certain&mdash;and
      he defenceless. An old man wanting to look on beauty! It was ridiculous!
      Age closed his mouth, paralysed his power to fight. He had no right to
      what was warm and living, no right to anything but memories and sorrow. He
      could not plead with her; even an old man has his dignity. Defenceless!
      For an hour, lost to bodily fatigue, he paced up and down, past the bowl
      of carnations he had plucked, which mocked him with its scent. Of all
      things hard to bear, the prostration of will-power is hardest, for one who
      has always had his way. Nature had got him in its net, and like an unhappy
      fish he turned and swam at the meshes, here and there, found no hole, no
      breaking point. They brought him tea at five o&rsquo;clock, and a letter.
      For a moment hope beat up in him. He cut the envelope with the butter
      knife, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST UNCLE JOLYON,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear to write anything
      that may disappoint you, but I was too cowardly to tell you last night. I
      feel I can&rsquo;t come down and give Holly any more lessons, now that
      June is coming back. Some things go too deep to be forgotten. It has been
      such a joy to see you and Holly. Perhaps I shall still see you sometimes
      when you come up, though I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not good for you; I can
      see you are tiring yourself too much. I believe you ought to rest quite
      quietly all this hot weather, and now you have your son and June coming
      back you will be so happy. Thank you a million times for all your
      sweetness to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovingly your IRENE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, there it was! Not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly
      cared about; to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things,
      the approach of death with its stealthy, rustling footsteps. Not good for
      him! Not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life,
      the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tea grew cold, his cigar remained unlit; and up and down he paced,
      torn between his dignity and his hold on life. Intolerable to be squeezed
      out slowly, without a say of your own, to live on when your will was in
      the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love.
      Intolerable! He would see what telling her the truth would do&mdash;the
      truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on. He
      sat down at his old bureau and took a pen. But he could not write. There
      was something revolting in having to plead like this; plead that she
      should warm his eyes with her beauty. It was tantamount to confessing
      dotage. He simply could not. And instead, he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to
      stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little
      grand-daughter. But old men learn to forego their whims; they are obliged
      to, even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later; and perhaps
      the sooner the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love to you,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bitter,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m
      tired.&rsquo; He sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post,
      and hearing it fall to the bottom, thought: &lsquo;There goes all I&rsquo;ve
      looked forward to!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner which he scarcely touched, after his cigar which
      he left half-smoked for it made him feel faint, he went very slowly
      upstairs and stole into the night-nursery. He sat down on the window-seat.
      A night-light was burning, and he could just see Holly&rsquo;s face, with
      one hand underneath the cheek. An early cockchafer buzzed in the Japanese
      paper with which they had filled the grate, and one of the horses in the
      stable stamped restlessly. To sleep like that child! He pressed apart two
      rungs of the venetian blind and looked out. The moon was rising,
      blood-red. He had never seen so red a moon. The woods and fields out there
      were dropping to sleep too, in the last glimmer of the summer light. And
      beauty, like a spirit, walked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long life,&rsquo;
      he thought, &lsquo;the best of nearly everything. I&rsquo;m an ungrateful
      chap; I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of beauty in my time. Poor young Bosinney said
      I had a sense of beauty. There&rsquo;s a man in the moon to-night!&rsquo;
      A moth went by, another, another. &lsquo;Ladies in grey!&rsquo; He closed
      his eyes. A feeling that he would never open them again beset him; he let
      it grow, let himself sink; then, with a shiver, dragged the lids up. There
      was something wrong with him, no doubt, deeply wrong; he would have to
      have the doctor after all. It didn&rsquo;t much matter now! Into that
      coppice the moon-light would have crept; there would be shadows, and those
      shadows would be the only things awake. No birds, beasts, flowers,
      insects; Just the shadows &mdash;moving; &lsquo;Ladies in grey!&rsquo;
      Over that log they would climb; would whisper together. She and Bosinney!
      Funny thought! And the frogs and little things would whisper too! How the
      clock ticked, in here! It was all eerie&mdash;out there in the light of
      that red moon; in here with the little steady night-light and, the ticking
      clock and the nurse&rsquo;s dressing-gown hanging from the edge of the
      screen, tall, like a woman&rsquo;s figure. &lsquo;Lady in grey!&rsquo; And
      a very odd thought beset him: Did she exist? Had she ever come at all? Or
      was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so
      soon? The violet-grey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber
      hair, who walks the dawn and the moonlight, and at blue-bell time? What
      was she, who was she, did she exist? He rose and stood a moment clutching
      the window-sill, to give him a sense of reality again; then began
      tiptoeing towards the door. He stopped at the foot of the bed; and Holly,
      as if conscious of his eyes fixed on her, stirred, sighed, and curled up
      closer in defence. He tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage;
      reached his room, undressed at once, and stood before a mirror in his
      night-shirt. What a scarecrow&mdash;with temples fallen in, and thin legs!
      His eyes resisted his own image, and a look of pride came on his face. All
      was in league to pull him down, even his reflection in the glass, but he
      was not down&mdash;yet! He got into bed, and lay a long time without
      sleeping, trying to reach resignation, only too well aware that fretting
      and disappointment were very bad for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for
      the doctor. After sounding him, the fellow pulled a face as long as your
      arm, and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking. That was no
      hardship; there was nothing to get up for, and when he felt ill, tobacco
      always lost its savour. He spent the morning languidly with the sun-blinds
      down, turning and re-turning The Times, not reading much, the dog
      Balthasar lying beside his bed. With his lunch they brought him a
      telegram, running thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at
      four-thirty. Irene.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming down! After all! Then she did exist&mdash;and he was not deserted.
      Coming down! A glow ran through his limbs; his cheeks and forehead felt
      hot. He drank his soup, and pushed the tray-table away, lying very quiet
      until they had removed lunch and left him alone; but every now and then
      his eyes twinkled. Coming down! His heart beat fast, and then did not seem
      to beat at all. At three o&rsquo;clock he got up and dressed deliberately,
      noiselessly. Holly and Mam&rsquo;zelle would be in the schoolroom, and the
      servants asleep after their dinner, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. He opened
      his door cautiously, and went downstairs. In the hall the dog Balthasar
      lay solitary, and, followed by him, old Jolyon passed into his study and
      out into the burning afternoon. He meant to go down and meet her in the
      coppice, but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat. He sat
      down instead under the oak tree by the swing, and the dog Balthasar, who
      also felt the heat, lay down beside him. He sat there smiling. What a
      revel of bright minutes! What a hum of insects, and cooing of pigeons! It
      was the quintessence of a summer day. Lovely! And he was happy&mdash;happy
      as a sand-boy, whatever that might be. She was coming; she had not given
      him up! He had everything in life he wanted&mdash;except a little more
      breath, and less weight&mdash;just here! He would see her when she emerged
      from the fernery, come swaying just a little, a violet-grey figure passing
      over the daisies and dandelions and &lsquo;soldiers&rsquo; on the lawn&mdash;the
      soldiers with their flowery crowns. He would not move, but she would come
      up to him and say: &lsquo;Dear Uncle Jolyon, I am sorry!&rsquo; and sit in
      the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very
      well but was all right now; and that dog would lick her hand. That dog
      knew his master was fond of her; that dog was a good dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite shady under the tree; the sun could not get at him, only make
      the rest of the world bright so that he could see the Grand Stand at Epsom
      away out there, very far, and the cows cropping the clover in the field
      and swishing at the flies with their tails. He smelled the scent of limes,
      and lavender. Ah! that was why there was such a racket of bees. They were
      excited&mdash;busy, as his heart was busy and excited. Drowsy, too, drowsy
      and drugged on honey and happiness; as his heart was drugged and drowsy.
      Summer&mdash;summer&mdash;they seemed saying; great bees and little bees,
      and the flies too!
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable clock struck four; in half an hour she would be here. He would
      have just one tiny nap, because he had had so little sleep of late; and
      then he would be fresh for her, fresh for youth and beauty, coming towards
      him across the sunlit lawn&mdash;lady in grey! And settling back in his
      chair he closed his eyes. Some thistle-down came on what little air there
      was, and pitched on his moustache more white than itself. He did not know;
      but his breathing stirred it, caught there. A ray of sunlight struck
      through and lodged on his boot. A bumble-bee alighted and strolled on the
      crown of his Panama hat. And the delicious surge of slumber reached the
      brain beneath that hat, and the head swayed forward and rested on his
      breast. Summer&mdash;summer! So went the hum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable clock struck the quarter past. The dog Balthasar stretched and
      looked up at his master. The thistledown no longer moved. The dog placed
      his chin over the sunlit foot. It did not stir. The dog withdrew his chin
      quickly, rose, and leaped on old Jolyon&rsquo;s lap, looked in his face,
      whined; then, leaping down, sat on his haunches, gazing up. And suddenly
      he uttered a long, long howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thistledown was still as death, and the face of his old master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer&mdash;summer&mdash;summer! The soundless footsteps on the grass!

      CHAPTER I&mdash;AT TIMOTHY&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      The possessive instinct never stands still. Through florescence and feud,
      frosts and fires, it followed the laws of progression even in the Forsyte
      family which had believed it fixed for ever. Nor can it be dissociated
      from environment any more than the quality of potato from the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The historian of the English eighties and nineties will, in his good time,
      depict the somewhat rapid progression from self-contented and contained
      provincialism to still more self-contented if less contained imperialism&mdash;in
      other words, the &lsquo;possessive&rsquo; instinct of the nation on the
      move. And so, as if in conformity, was it with the Forsyte family. They
      were spreading not merely on the surface, but within.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in 1895, Susan Hayman, the married Forsyte sister, followed her
      husband at the ludicrously low age of seventy-four, and was cremated, it
      made strangely little stir among the six old Forsytes left. For this
      apathy there were three causes. First: the almost surreptitious burial of
      old Jolyon in 1892 down at Robin Hill&mdash;first of the Forsytes to
      desert the family grave at Highgate. That burial, coming a year after
      Swithin&rsquo;s entirely proper funeral, had occasioned a great deal of
      talk on Forsyte &lsquo;Change, the abode of Timothy Forsyte on the
      Bayswater Road, London, which still collected and radiated family gossip.
      Opinions ranged from the lamentation of Aunt Juley to the outspoken
      assertion of Francie that it was &lsquo;a jolly good thing to stop all
      that stuffy Highgate business.&rsquo; Uncle Jolyon in his later years&mdash;indeed,
      ever since the strange and lamentable affair between his granddaughter
      June&rsquo;s lover, young Bosinney, and Irene, his nephew Soames Forsyte&rsquo;s
      wife&mdash;had noticeably rapped the family&rsquo;s knuckles; and that way
      of his own which he had always taken had begun to seem to them a little
      wayward. The philosophic vein in him, of course, had always been too
      liable to crop out of the strata of pure Forsyteism, so they were in a way
      prepared for his interment in a strange spot. But the whole thing was an
      odd business, and when the contents of his Will became current coin on
      Forsyte &lsquo;Change, a shiver had gone round the clan. Out of his estate
      (L145,304 gross, with liabilities L35 7s. 4d.) he had actually left
      L15,000 to &ldquo;whomever do you think, my dear? To Irene!&rdquo; that
      runaway wife of his nephew Soames; Irene, a woman who had almost disgraced
      the family, and&mdash;still more amazing was to him no blood relation. Not
      out and out, of course; only a life interest&mdash;only the income from
      it! Still, there it was; and old Jolyon&rsquo;s claim to be the perfect
      Forsyte was ended once for all. That, then, was the first reason why the
      burial of Susan Hayman&mdash;at Woking&mdash;made little stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason was altogether more expansive and imperial. Besides the
      house on Campden Hill, Susan had a place (left her by Hayman when he died)
      just over the border in Hants, where the Hayman boys had learned to be
      such good shots and riders, as it was believed, which was of course nice
      for them, and creditable to everybody; and the fact of owning something
      really countrified seemed somehow to excuse the dispersion of her remains&mdash;though
      what could have put cremation into her head they could not think! The
      usual invitations, however, had been issued, and Soames had gone down and
      young Nicholas, and the Will had been quite satisfactory so far as it
      went, for she had only had a life interest; and everything had gone quite
      smoothly to the children in equal shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third reason why Susan&rsquo;s burial made little stir was the most
      expansive of all. It was summed up daringly by Euphemia, the pale, the
      thin: &ldquo;Well, I think people have a right to their own bodies, even
      when they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; Coming from a daughter of Nicholas, a
      Liberal of the old school and most tyrannical, it was a startling remark&mdash;showing
      in a flash what a lot of water had run under bridges since the death of
      Aunt Ann in &lsquo;86, just when the proprietorship of Soames over his
      wife&rsquo;s body was acquiring the uncertainty which had led to such
      disaster. Euphemia, of course, spoke like a child, and had no experience;
      for though well over thirty by now, her name was still Forsyte. But,
      making all allowances, her remark did undoubtedly show expansion of the
      principle of liberty, decentralisation and shift in the central point of
      possession from others to oneself. When Nicholas heard his daughter&rsquo;s
      remark from Aunt Hester he had rapped out: &ldquo;Wives and daughters!
      There&rsquo;s no end to their liberty in these days. I knew that &lsquo;Jackson&rsquo;
      case would lead to things&mdash;lugging in Habeas Corpus like that!&rdquo;
      He had, of course, never really forgiven the Married Woman&rsquo;s
      Property Act, which would so have interfered with him if he had not
      mercifully married before it was passed. But, in truth, there was no
      denying the revolt among the younger Forsytes against being owned by
      others; that, as it were, Colonial disposition to own oneself, which is
      the paradoxical forerunner of Imperialism, was making progress all the
      time. They were all now married, except George, confirmed to the Turf and
      the Iseeum Club; Francie, pursuing her musical career in a studio off the
      King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea, and still taking &lsquo;lovers&rsquo; to
      dances; Euphemia, living at home and complaining of Nicholas; and those
      two Dromios, Giles and Jesse Hayman. Of the third generation there were
      not very many&mdash;young Jolyon had three, Winifred Dartie four, young
      Nicholas six already, young Roger had one, Marian Tweetyman one; St. John
      Hayman two. But the rest of the sixteen married&mdash;Soames, Rachel and
      Cicely of James&rsquo; family; Eustace and Thomas of Roger&rsquo;s;
      Ernest, Archibald and Florence of Nicholas&rsquo;. Augustus and Annabel
      Spender of the Hayman&rsquo;s&mdash;were going down the years
      unreproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, of the ten old Forsytes twenty-one young Forsytes had been born; but
      of the twenty-one young Forsytes there were as yet only seventeen
      descendants; and it already seemed unlikely that there would be more than
      a further unconsidered trifle or so. A student of statistics must have
      noticed that the birth rate had varied in accordance with the rate of
      interest for your money. Grandfather &lsquo;Superior Dosset&rsquo; Forsyte
      in the early nineteenth century had been getting ten per cent. for his,
      hence ten children. Those ten, leaving out the four who had not married,
      and Juley, whose husband Septimus Small had, of course, died almost at
      once, had averaged from four to five per cent. for theirs, and produced
      accordingly. The twenty-one whom they produced were now getting barely
      three per cent. in the Consols to which their father had mostly tied the
      Settlements they made to avoid death duties, and the six of them who had
      been reproduced had seventeen children, or just the proper two and
      five-sixths per stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other reasons, too, for this mild reproduction. A distrust of
      their earning powers, natural where a sufficiency is guaranteed, together
      with the knowledge that their fathers did not die, kept them cautious. If
      one had children and not much income, the standard of taste and comfort
      must of necessity go down; what was enough for two was not enough for
      four, and so on&mdash;it would be better to wait and see what Father did.
      Besides, it was nice to be able to take holidays unhampered. Sooner in
      fact than own children, they preferred to concentrate on the ownership of
      themselves, conforming to the growing tendency fin de siecle, as it was
      called. In this way, little risk was run, and one would be able to have a
      motor-car. Indeed, Eustace already had one, but it had shaken him
      horribly, and broken one of his eye teeth; so that it would be better to
      wait till they were a little safer. In the meantime, no more children!
      Even young Nicholas was drawing in his horns, and had made no addition to
      his six for quite three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corporate decay, however, of the Forsytes, their dispersion rather, of
      which all this was symptomatic, had not advanced so far as to prevent a
      rally when Roger Forsyte died in 1899. It had been a glorious summer, and
      after holidays abroad and at the sea they were practically all back in
      London, when Roger with a touch of his old originality had suddenly
      breathed his last at his own house in Princes Gardens. At Timothy&rsquo;s
      it was whispered sadly that poor Roger had always been eccentric about his
      digestion&mdash;had he not, for instance, preferred German mutton to all
      the other brands?
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, his funeral at Highgate had been perfect, and coming
      away from it Soames Forsyte made almost mechanically for his Uncle Timothy&rsquo;s
      in the Bayswater Road. The &lsquo;Old Things&rsquo;&mdash;Aunt Juley and
      Aunt Hester&mdash;would like to hear about it. His father&mdash;James&mdash;at
      eighty-eight had not felt up to the fatigue of the funeral; and Timothy
      himself, of course, had not gone; so that Nicholas had been the only
      brother present. Still, there had been a fair gathering; and it would
      cheer Aunts Juley and Hester up to know. The kindly thought was not
      unmixed with the inevitable longing to get something out of everything you
      do, which is the chief characteristic of Forsytes, and indeed of the saner
      elements in every nation. In this practice of taking family matters to
      Timothy&rsquo;s in the Bayswater Road, Soames was but following in the
      footsteps of his father, who had been in the habit of going at least once
      a week to see his sisters at Timothy&rsquo;s, and had only given it up
      when he lost his nerve at eighty-six, and could not go out without Emily.
      To go with Emily was of no use, for who could really talk to anyone in the
      presence of his own wife? Like James in the old days, Soames found time to
      go there nearly every Sunday, and sit in the little drawing-room into
      which, with his undoubted taste, he had introduced a good deal of change
      and china not quite up to his own fastidious mark, and at least two rather
      doubtful Barbizon pictures, at Christmastides. He himself, who had done
      extremely well with the Barbizons, had for some years past moved towards
      the Marises, Israels, and Mauve, and was hoping to do better. In the
      riverside house which he now inhabited near Mapledurham he had a gallery,
      beautifully hung and lighted, to which few London dealers were strangers.
      It served, too, as a Sunday afternoon attraction in those week-end parties
      which his sisters, Winifred or Rachel, occasionally organised for him. For
      though he was but a taciturn showman, his quiet collected determinism
      seldom failed to influence his guests, who knew that his reputation was
      grounded not on mere aesthetic fancy, but on his power of gauging the
      future of market values. When he went to Timothy&rsquo;s he almost always
      had some little tale of triumph over a dealer to unfold, and dearly he
      loved that coo of pride with which his aunts would greet it. This
      afternoon, however, he was differently animated, coming from Roger&rsquo;s
      funeral in his neat dark clothes&mdash;not quite black, for after all an
      uncle was but an uncle, and his soul abhorred excessive display of
      feeling. Leaning back in a marqueterie chair and gazing down his uplifted
      nose at the sky-blue walls plastered with gold frames, he was noticeably
      silent. Whether because he had been to a funeral or not, the peculiar
      Forsyte build of his face was seen to the best advantage this afternoon&mdash;a
      face concave and long, with a jaw which divested of flesh would have
      seemed extravagant: altogether a chinny face though not at all
      ill-looking. He was feeling more strongly than ever that Timothy&rsquo;s
      was hopelessly &lsquo;rum-ti-too&rsquo; and the souls of his aunts
      dismally mid-Victorian. The subject on which alone he wanted to talk&mdash;his
      own undivorced position&mdash;was unspeakable. And yet it occupied his
      mind to the exclusion of all else. It was only since the Spring that this
      had been so and a new feeling grown up which was egging him on towards
      what he knew might well be folly in a Forsyte of forty-five. More and more
      of late he had been conscious that he was &lsquo;getting on.&rsquo; The
      fortune already considerable when he conceived the house at Robin Hill
      which had finally wrecked his marriage with Irene, had mounted with
      surprising vigour in the twelve lonely years during which he had devoted
      himself to little else. He was worth to-day well over a hundred thousand
      pounds, and had no one to leave it to&mdash;no real object for going on
      with what was his religion. Even if he were to relax his efforts, money
      made money, and he felt that he would have a hundred and fifty thousand
      before he knew where he was. There had always been a strongly domestic,
      philoprogenitive side to Soames; baulked and frustrated, it had hidden
      itself away, but now had crept out again in this his &lsquo;prime of life.&rsquo;
      Concreted and focussed of late by the attraction of a girl&rsquo;s
      undoubted beauty, it had become a veritable prepossession.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this girl was French, not likely to lose her head, or accept any
      unlegalised position. Moreover, Soames himself disliked the thought of
      that. He had tasted of the sordid side of sex during those long years of
      forced celibacy, secretively, and always with disgust, for he was
      fastidious, and his sense of law and order innate. He wanted no hole and
      corner liaison. A marriage at the Embassy in Paris, a few months&rsquo;
      travel, and he could bring Annette back quite separated from a past which
      in truth was not too distinguished, for she only kept the accounts in her
      mother&rsquo;s Soho Restaurant; he could bring her back as something very
      new and chic with her French taste and self-possession, to reign at
      &lsquo;The Shelter&rsquo; near Mapledurham. On Forsyte &lsquo;Change and
      among his riverside friends it would be current that he had met a charming
      French girl on his travels and married her. There would be the flavour of
      romance, and a certain cachet about a French wife. No! He was not at all
      afraid of that. It was only this cursed undivorced condition of his, and&mdash;and
      the question whether Annette would take him, which he dared not put to the
      touch until he had a clear and even dazzling future to offer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his aunts&rsquo; drawing-room he heard with but muffled ears those
      usual questions: How was his dear father? Not going out, of course, now
      that the weather was turning chilly? Would Soames be sure to tell him that
      Hester had found boiled holly leaves most comforting for that pain in her
      side; a poultice every three hours, with red flannel afterwards. And could
      he relish just a little pot of their very best prune preserve&mdash;it was
      so delicious this year, and had such a wonderful effect. Oh! and about the
      Darties&mdash;had Soames heard that dear Winifred was having a most
      distressing time with Montague? Timothy thought she really ought to have
      protection It was said&mdash;but Soames mustn&rsquo;t take this for
      certain&mdash;that he had given some of Winifred&rsquo;s jewellery to a
      dreadful dancer. It was such a bad example for dear Val just as he was
      going to college. Soames had not heard? Oh, but he must go and see his
      sister and look into it at once! And did he think these Boers were really
      going to resist? Timothy was in quite a stew about it. The price of
      Consols was so high, and he had such a lot of money in them. Did Soames
      think they must go down if there was a war? Soames nodded. But it would be
      over very quickly. It would be so bad for Timothy if it wasn&rsquo;t. And
      of course Soames&rsquo; dear father would feel it very much at his age.
      Luckily poor dear Roger had been spared this dreadful anxiety. And Aunt
      Juley with a little handkerchief wiped away the large tear trying to climb
      the permanent pout on her now quite withered left cheek; she was
      remembering dear Roger, and all his originality, and how he used to stick
      pins into her when they were little together. Aunt Hester, with her
      instinct for avoiding the unpleasant, here chimed in: Did Soames think
      they would make Mr. Chamberlain Prime Minister at once? He would settle it
      all so quickly. She would like to see that old Kruger sent to St. Helena.
      She could remember so well the news of Napoleon&rsquo;s death, and what a
      relief it had been to his grandfather. Of course she and Juley&mdash;&ldquo;We
      were in pantalettes then, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;had not felt it much at the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took a cup of tea from her, drank it quickly, and ate three of
      those macaroons for which Timothy&rsquo;s was famous. His faint, pale,
      supercilious smile had deepened just a little. Really, his family remained
      hopelessly provincial, however much of London they might possess between
      them. In these go-ahead days their provincialism stared out even more than
      it used to. Why, old Nicholas was still a Free Trader, and a member of
      that antediluvian home of Liberalism, the Remove Club&mdash;though, to be
      sure, the members were pretty well all Conservatives now, or he himself
      could not have joined; and Timothy, they said, still wore a nightcap. Aunt
      Juley spoke again. Dear Soames was looking so well, hardly a day older
      than he did when dear Ann died, and they were all there together, dear
      Jolyon, and dear Swithin, and dear Roger. She paused and caught the tear
      which had climbed the pout on her right cheek. Did he&mdash;did he ever
      hear anything of Irene nowadays? Aunt Hester visibly interposed her
      shoulder. Really, Juley was always saying something! The smile left Soames&rsquo;
      face, and he put his cup down. Here was his subject broached for him, and
      for all his desire to expand, he could not take advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley went on rather hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say dear Jolyon first left her that fifteen thousand out and
      out; then of course he saw it would not be right, and made it for her life
      only.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Soames heard that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin Jolyon is a widower now. He is her trustee; you knew
      that, of course?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head. He did know, but wished to show no interest. Young
      Jolyon and he had not met since the day of Bosinney&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be quite middle-aged by now,&rdquo; went on Aunt Juley
      dreamily. &ldquo;Let me see, he was born when your dear uncle lived in
      Mount Street; long before they went to Stanhope Gate in December. Just
      before that dreadful Commune. Over fifty! Fancy that! Such a pretty baby,
      and we were all so proud of him; the very first of you all.&rdquo; Aunt
      Juley sighed, and a lock of not quite her own hair came loose and
      straggled, so that Aunt Hester gave a little shiver. Soames rose, he was
      experiencing a curious piece of self-discovery. That old wound to his
      pride and self-esteem was not yet closed. He had come thinking he could
      talk of it, even wanting to talk of his fettered condition, and&mdash;behold!
      he was shrinking away from this reminder by Aunt Juley, renowned for her
      Malapropisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Soames was not going already!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled a little vindictively, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Good-bye. Remember me to Uncle Timothy!&rdquo; And, leaving a
      cold kiss on each forehead, whose wrinkles seemed to try and cling to his
      lips as if longing to be kissed away, he left them looking brightly after
      him&mdash;dear Soames, it had been so good of him to come to-day, when
      they were not feeling very...!
    </p>
    <p>
      With compunction tweaking at his chest Soames descended the stairs, where
      was always that rather pleasant smell of camphor and port wine, and house
      where draughts are not permitted. The poor old things&mdash;he had not
      meant to be unkind! And in the street he instantly forgot them,
      repossessed by the image of Annette and the thought of the cursed coil
      around him. Why had he not pushed the thing through and obtained divorce
      when that wretched Bosinney was run over, and there was evidence galore
      for the asking! And he turned towards his sister Winifred Dartie&rsquo;s
      residence in Green Street, Mayfair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;EXIT A MAN OF THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      That a man of the world so subject to the vicissitudes of fortunes as
      Montague Dartie should still be living in a house he had inhabited twenty
      years at least would have been more noticeable if the rent, rates, taxes,
      and repairs of that house had not been defrayed by his father-in-law. By
      that simple if wholesale device James Forsyte had secured a certain
      stability in the lives of his daughter and his grandchildren. After all,
      there is something invaluable about a safe roof over the head of a
      sportsman so dashing as Dartie. Until the events of the last few days he
      had been almost-supernaturally steady all this year. The fact was he had
      acquired a half share in a filly of George Forsyte&rsquo;s, who had gone
      irreparably on the turf, to the horror of Roger, now stilled by the grave.
      Sleeve-links, by Martyr, out of Shirt-on-fire, by Suspender, was a bay
      filly, three years old, who for a variety of reasons had never shown her
      true form. With half ownership of this hopeful animal, all the idealism
      latent somewhere in Dartie, as in every other man, had put up its head,
      and kept him quietly ardent for months past. When a man has some thing
      good to live for it is astonishing how sober he becomes; and what Dartie
      had was really good&mdash;a three to one chance for an autumn handicap,
      publicly assessed at twenty-five to one. The old-fashioned heaven was a
      poor thing beside it, and his shirt was on the daughter of Shirt-on-fire.
      But how much more than his shirt depended on this granddaughter of
      Suspender! At that roving age of forty-five, trying to Forsytes&mdash;and,
      though perhaps less distinguishable from any other age, trying even to
      Darties&mdash;Montague had fixed his current fancy on a dancer. It was no
      mean passion, but without money, and a good deal of it, likely to remain a
      love as airy as her skirts; and Dartie never had any money, subsisting
      miserably on what he could beg or borrow from Winifred&mdash;a woman of
      character, who kept him because he was the father of her children, and
      from a lingering admiration for those now-dying Wardour Street good looks
      which in their youth had fascinated her. She, together with anyone else
      who would lend him anything, and his losses at cards and on the turf
      (extraordinary how some men make a good thing out of losses!) were his
      whole means of subsistence; for James was now too old and nervous to
      approach, and Soames too formidably adamant. It is not too much to say
      that Dartie had been living on hope for months. He had never been fond of
      money for itself, had always despised the Forsytes with their investing
      habits, though careful to make such use of them as he could. What he liked
      about money was what it bought&mdash;personal sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No real sportsman cares for money,&rdquo; he would say, borrowing a
      &lsquo;pony&rsquo; if it was no use trying for a &lsquo;monkey.&rsquo;
      There was something delicious about Montague Dartie. He was, as George
      Forsyte said, a &lsquo;daisy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the Handicap dawned clear and bright, the last day of
      September, and Dartie who had travelled to Newmarket the night before,
      arrayed himself in spotless checks and walked to an eminence to see his
      half of the filly take her final canter: If she won he would be a cool
      three thou. in pocket&mdash;a poor enough recompense for the sobriety and
      patience of these weeks of hope, while they had been nursing her for this
      race. But he had not been able to afford more. Should he &lsquo;lay it off&rsquo;
      at the eight to one to which she had advanced? This was his single thought
      while the larks sang above him, and the grassy downs smelled sweet, and
      the pretty filly passed, tossing her head and glowing like satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, if he lost it would not be he who paid, and to &lsquo;lay it
      off&rsquo; would reduce his winnings to some fifteen hundred&mdash;hardly
      enough to purchase a dancer out and out. Even more potent was the itch in
      the blood of all the Darties for a real flutter. And turning to George he
      said: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a clipper. She&rsquo;ll win hands down; I shall
      go the whole hog.&rdquo; George, who had laid off every penny, and a few
      besides, and stood to win, however it came out, grinned down on him from
      his bulky height, with the words: &ldquo;So ho, my wild one!&rdquo; for
      after a chequered apprenticeship weathered with the money of a deeply
      complaining Roger, his Forsyte blood was beginning to stand him in good
      stead in the profession of owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments of disillusionment in the lives of men from which the
      sensitive recorder shrinks. Suffice it to say that the good thing fell
      down. Sleeve-links finished in the ruck. Dartie&rsquo;s shirt was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the passing of these things and the day when Soames turned his
      face towards Green Street, what had not happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man with the constitution of Montague Dartie has exercised
      self-control for months from religious motives, and remains unrewarded, he
      does not curse God and die, he curses God and lives, to the distress of
      his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&mdash;a plucky woman, if a little too fashionable&mdash;who had
      borne the brunt of him for exactly twenty-one years, had never really
      believed that he would do what he now did. Like so many wives, she thought
      she knew the worst, but she had not yet known him in his forty-fifth year,
      when he, like other men, felt that it was now or never. Paying on the 2nd
      of October a visit of inspection to her jewel case, she was horrified to
      observe that her woman&rsquo;s crown and glory was gone&mdash;the pearls
      which Montague had given her in &lsquo;86, when Benedict was born, and
      which James had been compelled to pay for in the spring of &lsquo;87, to
      save scandal. She consulted her husband at once. He &lsquo;pooh-poohed&rsquo;
      the matter. They would turn up! Nor till she said sharply: &ldquo;Very
      well, then, Monty, I shall go down to Scotland Yard myself,&rdquo; did he
      consent to take the matter in hand. Alas! that the steady and resolved
      continuity of design necessary to the accomplishment of sweeping
      operations should be liable to interruption by drink. That night Dartie
      returned home without a care in the world or a particle of reticence.
      Under normal conditions Winifred would merely have locked her door and let
      him sleep it off, but torturing suspense about her pearls had caused her
      to wait up for him. Taking a small revolver from his pocket and holding on
      to the dining table, he told her at once that he did not care a cursh
      whether she lived s&rsquo;long as she was quiet; but he himself wash tired
      o&rsquo; life. Winifred, holding onto the other side of the dining table,
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a clown, Monty. Have you been to Scotland Yard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the revolver against his chest, Dartie had pulled the trigger
      several times. It was not loaded. Dropping it with an imprecation, he had
      muttered: &ldquo;For shake o&rsquo; the children,&rdquo; and sank into a
      chair. Winifred, having picked up the revolver, gave him some soda water.
      The liquor had a magical effect. Life had illused him; Winifred had never
      &lsquo;unshtood&rsquo;m.&rsquo; If he hadn&rsquo;t the right to take the
      pearls he had given her himself, who had? That Spanish filly had got&rsquo;m.
      If Winifred had any &lsquo;jection he w&rsquo;d cut&mdash;her&mdash;throat.
      What was the matter with that? (Probably the first use of that celebrated
      phrase&mdash;so obscure are the origins of even the most classical
      language!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, who had learned self-containment in a hard school, looked up at
      him, and said: &ldquo;Spanish filly! Do you mean that girl we saw dancing
      in the Pandemonium Ballet? Well, you are a thief and a blackguard.&rdquo;
      It had been the last straw on a sorely loaded consciousness; reaching up
      from his chair Dartie seized his wife&rsquo;s arm, and recalling the
      achievements of his boyhood, twisted it. Winifred endured the agony with
      tears in her eyes, but no murmur. Watching for a moment of weakness, she
      wrenched it free; then placing the dining table between them, said between
      her teeth: &ldquo;You are the limit, Monty.&rdquo; (Undoubtedly the
      inception of that phrase&mdash;so is English formed under the stress of
      circumstances.) Leaving Dartie with foam on his dark moustache she went
      upstairs, and, after locking her door and bathing her arm in hot water,
      lay awake all night, thinking of her pearls adorning the neck of another,
      and of the consideration her husband had presumably received therefor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of the world awoke with a sense of being lost to that world, and a
      dim recollection of having been called a &lsquo;limit.&rsquo; He sat for
      half an hour in the dawn and the armchair where he had slept&mdash;perhaps
      the unhappiest half-hour he had ever spent, for even to a Dartie there is
      something tragic about an end. And he knew that he had reached it. Never
      again would he sleep in his dining-room and wake with the light filtering
      through those curtains bought by Winifred at Nickens and Jarveys with the
      money of James. Never again eat a devilled kidney at that rose-wood table,
      after a roll in the sheets and a hot bath. He took his note case from his
      dress coat pocket. Four hundred pounds, in fives and tens&mdash;the
      remainder of the proceeds of his half of Sleeve-links, sold last night,
      cash down, to George Forsyte, who, having won over the race, had not
      conceived the sudden dislike to the animal which he himself now felt. The
      ballet was going to Buenos Aires the day after to-morrow, and he was going
      too. Full value for the pearls had not yet been received; he was only at
      the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole upstairs. Not daring to have a bath, or shave (besides, the water
      would be cold), he changed his clothes and packed stealthily all he could.
      It was hard to leave so many shining boots, but one must sacrifice
      something. Then, carrying a valise in either hand, he stepped out onto the
      landing. The house was very quiet&mdash;that house where he had begotten
      his four children. It was a curious moment, this, outside the room of his
      wife, once admired, if not perhaps loved, who had called him &lsquo;the
      limit.&rsquo; He steeled himself with that phrase, and tiptoed on; but the
      next door was harder to pass. It was the room his daughters slept in. Maud
      was at school, but Imogen would be lying there; and moisture came into
      Dartie&rsquo;s early morning eyes. She was the most like him of the four,
      with her dark hair, and her luscious brown glance. Just coming out, a
      pretty thing! He set down the two valises. This almost formal abdication
      of fatherhood hurt him. The morning light fell on a face which worked with
      real emotion. Nothing so false as penitence moved him; but genuine
      paternal feeling, and that melancholy of &lsquo;never again.&rsquo; He
      moistened his lips; and complete irresolution for a moment paralysed his
      legs in their check trousers. It was hard&mdash;hard to be thus compelled
      to leave his home! &ldquo;D&mdash;-nit!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I never
      thought it would come to this.&rdquo; Noises above warned him that the
      maids were beginning to get up. And grasping the two valises, he tiptoed
      on downstairs. His cheeks were wet, and the knowledge of that was
      comforting, as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his sacrifice. He
      lingered a little in the rooms below, to pack all the cigars he had, some
      papers, a crush hat, a silver cigarette box, a Ruff&rsquo;s Guide. Then,
      mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda, and lighting a cigarette, he stood
      hesitating before a photograph of his two girls, in a silver frame. It
      belonged to Winifred. &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;she can
      get another taken, and I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; He slipped it into the
      valise. Then, putting on his hat and overcoat, he took two others, his
      best malacca cane, an umbrella, and opened the front door. Closing it
      softly behind him, he walked out, burdened as he had never been in all his
      life, and made his way round the corner to wait there for an early cab to
      come by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had passed Montague Dartie in the forty-fifth year of his age from
      the house which he had called his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Winifred came down, and realised that he was not in the house, her
      first feeling was one of dull anger that he should thus elude the
      reproaches she had carefully prepared in those long wakeful hours. He had
      gone off to Newmarket or Brighton, with that woman as likely as not.
      Disgusting! Forced to a complete reticence before Imogen and the servants,
      and aware that her father&rsquo;s nerves would never stand the disclosure,
      she had been unable to refrain from going to Timothy&rsquo;s that
      afternoon, and pouring out the story of the pearls to Aunts Juley and
      Hester in utter confidence. It was only on the following morning that she
      noticed the disappearance of that photograph. What did it mean? Careful
      examination of her husband&rsquo;s relics prompted the thought that he had
      gone for good. As that conclusion hardened she stood quite still in the
      middle of his dressing-room, with all the drawers pulled out, to try and
      realise what she was feeling. By no means easy! Though he was &lsquo;the
      limit&rsquo; he was yet her property, and for the life of her she could
      not but feel the poorer. To be widowed yet not widowed at forty-two; with
      four children; made conspicuous, an object of commiseration! Gone to the
      arms of a Spanish Jade! Memories, feelings, which she had thought quite
      dead, revived within her, painful, sullen, tenacious. Mechanically she
      closed drawer after drawer, went to her bed, lay on it, and buried her
      face in the pillows. She did not cry. What was the use of that? When she
      got off her bed to go down to lunch she felt as if only one thing could do
      her good, and that was to have Val home. He&mdash;her eldest boy&mdash;who
      was to go to Oxford next month at James&rsquo; expense, was at
      Littlehampton taking his final gallops with his trainer for Smalls, as he
      would have phrased it following his father&rsquo;s diction. She caused a
      telegram to be sent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see about his clothes,&rdquo; she said to Imogen; &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t have him going up to Oxford all anyhow. Those boys are so
      particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val&rsquo;s got heaps of things,&rdquo; Imogen answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but they want overhauling. I hope he&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come like a shot, Mother. But he&rsquo;ll probably skew
      his Exam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;I want him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an innocent shrewd look at her mother&rsquo;s face, Imogen kept
      silence. It was father, of course! Val did come &lsquo;like a shot&rsquo;
      at six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a cross between a pickle and a Forsyte and you have young Publius
      Valerius Dartie. A youth so named could hardly turn out otherwise. When he
      was born, Winifred, in the heyday of spirits, and the craving for
      distinction, had determined that her children should have names such as no
      others had ever had. (It was a mercy&mdash;she felt now&mdash;that she had
      just not named Imogen Thisbe.) But it was to George Forsyte, always a wag,
      that Val&rsquo;s christening was due. It so happened that Dartie, dining
      with him a week after the birth of his son and heir, had mentioned this
      aspiration of Winifred&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him Cato,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be damned
      piquant!&rdquo; He had just won a tenner on a horse of that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cato!&rdquo; Dartie had replied&mdash;they were a little &lsquo;on&rsquo;
      as the phrase was even in those days&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a
      Christian name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halo you!&rdquo; George called to a waiter in knee breeches.
      &ldquo;Bring me the Encyc&rsquo;pedia Brit. from the Library, letter C.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; said George, pointing with his cigar: &ldquo;Cato
      Publius Valerius by Virgil out of Lydia. That&rsquo;s what you want.
      Publius Valerius is Christian enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie, on arriving home, had informed Winifred. She had been charmed. It
      was so &lsquo;chic.&rsquo; And Publius Valerius became the baby&rsquo;s
      name, though it afterwards transpired that they had got hold of the
      inferior Cato. In 1890, however, when little Publius was nearly ten, the
      word &lsquo;chic&rsquo; went out of fashion, and sobriety came in;
      Winifred began to have doubts. They were confirmed by little Publius
      himself who returned from his first term at school complaining that life
      was a burden to him&mdash;they called him Pubby. Winifred&mdash;a woman of
      real decision&mdash;promptly changed his school and his name to Val, the
      Publius being dropped even as an initial.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nineteen he was a limber, freckled youth with a wide mouth, light eyes,
      long dark lashes; a rather charming smile, considerable knowledge of what
      he should not know, and no experience of what he ought to do. Few boys had
      more narrowly escaped being expelled&mdash;the engaging rascal. After
      kissing his mother and pinching Imogen, he ran upstairs three at a time,
      and came down four, dressed for dinner. He was awfully sorry, but his
      &lsquo;trainer,&rsquo; who had come up too, had asked him to dine at the
      Oxford and Cambridge; it wouldn&rsquo;t do to miss&mdash;the old chap
      would be hurt. Winifred let him go with an unhappy pride. She had wanted
      him at home, but it was very nice to know that his tutor was so fond of
      him. He went out with a wink at Imogen, saying: &ldquo;I say, Mother,
      could I have two plover&rsquo;s eggs when I come in?&mdash;cook&rsquo;s
      got some. They top up so jolly well. Oh! and look here&mdash;have you any
      money?&mdash;I had to borrow a fiver from old Snobby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, looking at him with fond shrewdness, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are naughty about money. But you shouldn&rsquo;t pay
      him to-night, anyway; you&rsquo;re his guest. How nice and slim he looked
      in his white waistcoat, and his dark thick lashes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but we may go to the theatre, you see, Mother; and I think I
      ought to stand the tickets; he&rsquo;s always hard up, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred produced a five-pound note, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;d better pay him, but you mustn&rsquo;t
      stand the tickets too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val pocketed the fiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-night, Mum!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out with his head up and his hat cocked joyously, sniffing the air
      of Piccadilly like a young hound loosed into covert. Jolly good biz! After
      that mouldy old slow hole down there!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his &lsquo;tutor,&rsquo; not indeed at the Oxford and Cambridge,
      but at the Goat&rsquo;s Club. This &lsquo;tutor&rsquo; was a year older
      than himself, a good-looking youth, with fine brown eyes, and smooth dark
      hair, a small mouth, an oval face, languid, immaculate, cool to a degree,
      one of those young men who without effort establish moral ascendancy over
      their companions. He had missed being expelled from school a year before
      Val, had spent that year at Oxford, and Val could almost see a halo round
      his head. His name was Crum, and no one could get through money quicker.
      It seemed to be his only aim in life&mdash;dazzling to young Val, in whom,
      however, the Forsyte would stand apart, now and then, wondering where the
      value for that money was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined quietly, in style and taste; left the Club smoking cigars, with
      just two bottles inside them, and dropped into stalls at the Liberty. For
      Val the sound of comic songs, the sight of lovely legs were fogged and
      interrupted by haunting fears that he would never equal Crum&rsquo;s quiet
      dandyism. His idealism was roused; and when that is so, one is never quite
      at ease. Surely he had too wide a mouth, not the best cut of waistcoat, no
      braid on his trousers, and his lavender gloves had no thin black
      stitchings down the back. Besides, he laughed too much&mdash;Crum never
      laughed, he only smiled, with his regular dark brows raised a little so
      that they formed a gable over his just drooped lids. No! he would never be
      Crum&rsquo;s equal. All the same it was a jolly good show, and Cynthia
      Dark simply ripping. Between the acts Crum regaled him with particulars of
      Cynthia&rsquo;s private life, and the awful knowledge became Val&rsquo;s
      that, if he liked, Crum could go behind. He simply longed to say: &ldquo;I
      say, take me!&rdquo; but dared not, because of his deficiencies; and this
      made the last act or two almost miserable. On coming out Crum said:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half an hour before they close; let&rsquo;s go on to the
      Pandemonium.&rdquo; They took a hansom to travel the hundred yards, and
      seats costing seven-and-six apiece because they were going to stand, and
      walked into the Promenade. It was in these little things, this utter
      negligence of money that Crum had such engaging polish. The ballet was on
      its last legs and night, and the traffic of the Promenade was suffering
      for the moment. Men and women were crowded in three rows against the
      barrier. The whirl and dazzle on the stage, the half dark, the mingled
      tobacco fumes and women&rsquo;s scent, all that curious lure to
      promiscuity which belongs to Promenades, began to free young Val from his
      idealism. He looked admiringly in a young woman&rsquo;s face, saw she was
      not young, and quickly looked away. Shades of Cynthia Dark! The young
      woman&rsquo;s arm touched his unconsciously; there was a scent of musk and
      mignonette. Val looked round the corner of his lashes. Perhaps she was
      young, after all. Her foot trod on his; she begged his pardon. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; jolly good ballet, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m tired of it; aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Val smiled&mdash;his wide, rather charming smile. Beyond that he did
      not go&mdash;not yet convinced. The Forsyte in him stood out for greater
      certainty. And on the stage the ballet whirled its kaleidoscope of
      snow-white, salmon-pink, and emerald-green and violet and seemed suddenly
      to freeze into a stilly spangled pyramid. Applause broke out, and it was
      over! Maroon curtains had cut it off. The semi-circle of men and women
      round the barrier broke up, the young woman&rsquo;s arm pressed his. A
      little way off disturbance seemed centring round a man with a pink
      carnation; Val stole another glance at the young woman, who was looking
      towards it. Three men, unsteady, emerged, walking arm in arm. The one in
      the centre wore the pink carnation, a white waistcoat, a dark moustache;
      he reeled a little as he walked. Crum&rsquo;s voice said slow and level:
      &ldquo;Look at that bounder, he&rsquo;s screwed!&rdquo; Val turned to
      look. The &lsquo;bounder&rsquo; had disengaged his arm, and was pointing
      straight at them. Crum&rsquo;s voice, level as ever, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to know you!&rdquo; The &lsquo;bounder&rsquo; spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;llo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You f&rsquo;llows, look! There&rsquo;s
      my young rascal of a son!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val saw. It was his father! He could have sunk into the crimson carpet. It
      was not the meeting in this place, not even that his father was &lsquo;screwed&rsquo;.
      it was Crum&rsquo;s word &lsquo;bounder,&rsquo; which, as by heavenly
      revelation, he perceived at that moment to be true. Yes, his father looked
      a bounder with his dark good looks, and his pink carnation, and his
      square, self-assertive walk. And without a word he ducked behind the young
      woman and slipped out of the Promenade. He heard the word, &ldquo;Val!&rdquo;
      behind him, and ran down deep-carpeted steps past the &lsquo;chuckersout,&rsquo;
      into the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be ashamed of his own father is perhaps the bitterest experience a
      young man can go through. It seemed to Val, hurrying away, that his career
      had ended before it had begun. How could he go up to Oxford now amongst
      all those chaps, those splendid friends of Crum&rsquo;s, who would know
      that his father was a &lsquo;bounder&rsquo;. And suddenly he hated Crum.
      Who the devil was Crum, to say that? If Crum had been beside him at that
      moment, he would certainly have been jostled off the pavement. His own
      father&mdash;his own! A choke came up in his throat, and he dashed his
      hands down deep into his overcoat pockets. Damn Crum! He conceived the
      wild idea of running back and fending his father, taking him by the arm
      and walking about with him in front of Crum; but gave it up at once and
      pursued his way down Piccadilly. A young woman planted herself before him.
      &ldquo;Not so angry, darling!&rdquo; He shied, dodged her, and suddenly
      became quite cool. If Crum ever said a word, he would jolly well punch his
      head, and there would be an end of it. He walked a hundred yards or more,
      contented with that thought, then lost its comfort utterly. It wasn&rsquo;t
      simple like that! He remembered how, at school, when some parent came down
      who did not pass the standard, it just clung to the fellow afterwards. It
      was one of those things nothing could remove. Why had his mother married
      his father, if he was a &lsquo;bounder&rsquo;. It was bitterly unfair&mdash;jolly
      low-down on a fellow to give him a &lsquo;bounder&rsquo; for father. The
      worst of it was that now Crum had spoken the word, he realised that he had
      long known subconsciously that his father was not &lsquo;the clean potato.&rsquo;
      It was the beastliest thing that had ever happened to him&mdash;beastliest
      thing that had ever happened to any fellow! And, down-hearted as he had
      never yet been, he came to Green Street, and let himself in with a
      smuggled latch-key. In the dining-room his plover&rsquo;s eggs were set
      invitingly, with some cut bread and butter, and a little whisky at the
      bottom of a decanter&mdash;just enough, as Winifred had thought, for him
      to feel himself a man. It made him sick to look at them, and he went
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred heard him pass, and thought: &lsquo;The dear boy&rsquo;s in.
      Thank goodness! If he takes after his father I don&rsquo;t know what I
      shall do! But he won&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s like me. Dear Val!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;SOAMES PREPARES TO TAKE STEPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Soames entered his sister&rsquo;s little Louis Quinze drawing-room,
      with its small balcony, always flowered with hanging geraniums in the
      summer, and now with pots of Lilium Auratum, he was struck by the
      immutability of human affairs. It looked just the same as on his first
      visit to the newly married Darties twenty-one years ago. He had chosen the
      furniture himself, and so completely that no subsequent purchase had ever
      been able to change the room&rsquo;s atmosphere. Yes, he had founded his
      sister well, and she had wanted it. Indeed, it said a great deal for
      Winifred that after all this time with Dartie she remained well-founded.
      From the first Soames had nosed out Dartie&rsquo;s nature from underneath
      the plausibility, savoir faire, and good looks which had dazzled Winifred,
      her mother, and even James, to the extent of permitting the fellow to
      marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value into
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, whom he noticed next to the furniture, was sitting at her Buhl
      bureau with a letter in her hand. She rose and came towards him. Tall as
      himself, strong in the cheekbones, well tailored, something in her face
      disturbed Soames. She crumpled the letter in her hand, but seemed to
      change her mind and held it out to him. He was her lawyer as well as her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames read, on Iseeum Club paper, these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not get chance to insult in my own again. I am leaving
      country to-morrow. It&rsquo;s played out. I&rsquo;m tired of being
      insulted by you. You&rsquo;ve brought on yourself. No self-respecting man
      can stand it. I shall not ask you for anything again. Good-bye. I took the
      photograph of the two girls. Give them my love. I don&rsquo;t care what
      your family say. It&rsquo;s all their doing. I&rsquo;m going to live new
      life. &lsquo;M.D.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This after-dinner note had a splotch on it not yet quite dry. He looked at
      Winifred&mdash;the splotch had clearly come from her; and he checked the
      words: &lsquo;Good riddance!&rsquo; Then it occurred to him that with this
      letter she was entering that very state which he himself so earnestly
      desired to quit&mdash;the state of a Forsyte who was not divorced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had turned away, and was taking a long sniff from a little
      gold-topped bottle. A dull commiseration, together with a vague sense of
      injury, crept about Soames&rsquo; heart. He had come to her to talk of his
      own position, and get sympathy, and here was she in the same position,
      wanting of course to talk of it, and get sympathy from him. It was always
      like that! Nobody ever seemed to think that he had troubles and interests
      of his own. He folded up the letter with the splotch inside, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred recited the story of the pearls calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s really gone, Soames? You see the state he
      was in when he wrote that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames who, when he desired a thing, placated Providence by pretending
      that he did not think it likely to happen, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so. I might find out at his Club.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If George is there,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;he would know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George?&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I saw him at his father&rsquo;s
      funeral.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s sure to be there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, whose good sense applauded his sister&rsquo;s acumen, said
      grudgingly: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go round. Have you said anything in
      Park Lane?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told Emily,&rdquo; returned Winifred, who retained that
      &lsquo;chic&rsquo; way of describing her mother. &ldquo;Father would have
      a fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, anything untoward was now sedulously kept from James. With another
      look round at the furniture, as if to gauge his sister&rsquo;s exact
      position, Soames went out towards Piccadilly. The evening was drawing in&mdash;a
      touch of chill in the October haze. He walked quickly, with his close and
      concentrated air. He must get through, for he wished to dine in Soho. On
      hearing from the hall porter at the Iseeum that Mr. Dartie had not been in
      to-day, he looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if Mr.
      George Forsyte was in the Club. He was. Soames, who always looked askance
      at his cousin George, as one inclined to jest at his expense, followed the
      pageboy, slightly reassured by the thought that George had just lost his
      father. He must have come in for about thirty thousand, besides what he
      had under that settlement of Roger&rsquo;s, which had avoided death duty.
      He found George in a bow-window, staring out across a half-eaten plate of
      muffins. His tall, bulky, black-clothed figure loomed almost threatening,
      though preserving still the supernatural neatness of the racing man. With
      a faint grin on his fleshy face, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Soames! Have a muffin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; murmured Soames; and, nursing his hat, with the
      desire to say something suitable and sympathetic, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;so-so. Haven&rsquo;t seen you
      for ages. You never go racing. How&rsquo;s the City?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, scenting the approach of a jest, closed up, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask you about Dartie. I hear he&rsquo;s....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flitted, made a bolt to Buenos Aires with the fair Lola. Good for
      Winifred and the little Darties. He&rsquo;s a treat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded. Naturally inimical as these cousins were, Dartie made them
      kin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle James&rsquo;ll sleep in his bed now,&rdquo; resumed George;
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s had a lot off you, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You saw him further,&rdquo; said George amicably. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      a real rouser. Young Val will want a bit of looking after. I was always
      sorry for Winifred. She&rsquo;s a plucky woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Soames nodded. &ldquo;I must be getting back to her,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;she just wanted to know for certain. We may have to take steps. I
      suppose there&rsquo;s no mistake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite O.K.,&rdquo; said George&mdash;it was he who
      invented so many of those quaint sayings which have been assigned to other
      sources. &ldquo;He was drunk as a lord last night; but he went off all
      right this morning. His ship&rsquo;s the Tuscarora;&rdquo; and, fishing
      out a card, he read mockingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Montague Dartie, Poste Restante, Buenos Aires.&rsquo; I
      should hurry up with the steps, if I were you. He fairly fed me up last
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not always easy.&rdquo;
      Then, conscious from George&rsquo;s eyes that he had roused reminiscence
      of his own affair, he got up, and held out his hand. George rose too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember me to Winifred.... You&rsquo;ll enter her for the Divorce
      Stakes straight off if you ask me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took a sidelong look back at him from the doorway. George had
      seated himself again and was staring before him; he looked big and lonely
      in those black clothes. Soames had never known him so subdued. &lsquo;I
      suppose he feels it in a way,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;They must have
      about fifty thousand each, all told. They ought to keep the estate
      together. If there&rsquo;s a war, house property will go down. Uncle Roger
      was a good judge, though.&rsquo; And the face of Annette rose before him
      in the darkening street; her brown hair and her blue eyes with their dark
      lashes, her fresh lips and cheeks, dewy and blooming in spite of London,
      her perfect French figure. &lsquo;Take steps!&rsquo; he thought.
      Re-entering Winifred&rsquo;s house he encountered Val, and they went in
      together. An idea had occurred to Soames. His cousin Jolyon was Irene&rsquo;s
      trustee, the first step would be to go down and see him at Robin Hill.
      Robin Hill! The odd&mdash;the very odd feeling those words brought back!
      Robin Hill&mdash;the house Bosinney had built for him and Irene&mdash;the
      house they had never lived in&mdash;the fatal house! And Jolyon lived
      there now! H&rsquo;m! And suddenly he thought: &lsquo;They say he&rsquo;s
      got a boy at Oxford! Why not take young Val down and introduce them! It&rsquo;s
      an excuse! Less bald&mdash;very much less bald!&rsquo; So, as they went
      upstairs, he said to Val:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a cousin at Oxford; you&rsquo;ve never met him. I
      should like to take you down with me to-morrow to where he lives and
      introduce you. You&rsquo;ll find it useful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val, receiving the idea with but moderate transports, Soames clinched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you after lunch. It&rsquo;s in the country&mdash;not
      far; you&rsquo;ll enjoy it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold of the drawing-room he recalled with an effort that the
      steps he contemplated concerned Winifred at the moment, not himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was still sitting at her Buhl bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone to
      Buenos Aires, started this morning&mdash;we&rsquo;d better have him
      shadowed when he lands. I&rsquo;ll cable at once. Otherwise we may have a
      lot of expense. The sooner these things are done the better. I&rsquo;m
      always regretting that I didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo; he stopped, and looked
      sidelong at the silent Winifred. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;can you prove cruelty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred said in a dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What is cruelty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, has he struck you, or anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred shook herself, and her jaw grew square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He twisted my arm. Or would pointing a pistol count? Or being too
      drunk to undress himself, or&mdash;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bring in the
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;no! I wonder! Of course, there&rsquo;s
      legal separation&mdash;we can get that. But separation! Um!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; asked Winifred desolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he can&rsquo;t touch you, or you him; you&rsquo;re both of you
      married and unmarried.&rdquo; And again he grunted. What was it, in fact,
      but his own accursed position, legalised! No, he would not put her into
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be divorce,&rdquo; he said decisively; &ldquo;failing
      cruelty, there&rsquo;s desertion. There&rsquo;s a way of shortening the
      two years, now. We get the Court to give us restitution of conjugal
      rights. Then if he doesn&rsquo;t obey, we can bring a suit for divorce in
      six months&rsquo; time. Of course you don&rsquo;t want him back. But they
      won&rsquo;t know that. Still, there&rsquo;s the risk that he might come. I&rsquo;d
      rather try cruelty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beastly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Soames murmured, &ldquo;perhaps there isn&rsquo;t much
      risk so long as he&rsquo;s infatuated and got money. Don&rsquo;t say
      anything to anybody, and don&rsquo;t pay any of his debts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred sighed. In spite of all she had been through, the sense of loss
      was heavy on her. And this idea of not paying his debts any more brought
      it home to her as nothing else yet had. Some richness seemed to have gone
      out of life. Without her husband, without her pearls, without that
      intimate sense that she made a brave show above the domestic whirlpool,
      she would now have to face the world. She felt bereaved indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And into the chilly kiss he placed on her forehead, Soames put more than
      his usual warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go down to Robin Hill to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
      see young Jolyon on business. He&rsquo;s got a boy at Oxford. I&rsquo;d
      like to take Val with me and introduce him. Come down to &lsquo;The
      Shelter&rsquo; for the week-end and bring the children. Oh! by the way,
      no, that won&rsquo;t do; I&rsquo;ve got some other people coming.&rdquo;
      So saying, he left her and turned towards Soho.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;SOHO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called London, Soho is
      perhaps least suited to the Forsyte spirit. &lsquo;So-ho, my wild one!&rsquo;
      George would have said if he had seen his cousin going there. Untidy, full
      of Greeks, Ishmaelites, cats, Italians, tomatoes, restaurants, organs,
      coloured stuffs, queer names, people looking out of upper windows, it
      dwells remote from the British Body Politic. Yet has it haphazard
      proprietary instincts of its own, and a certain possessive prosperity
      which keeps its rents up when those of other quarters go down. For long
      years Soames&rsquo; acquaintanceship with Soho had been confined to its
      Western bastion, Wardour Street. Many bargains had he picked up there.
      Even during those seven years at Brighton after Bosinney&rsquo;s death and
      Irene&rsquo;s flight, he had bought treasures there sometimes, though he
      had no place to put them; for when the conviction that his wife had gone
      for good at last became firm within him, he had caused a board to be put
      up in Montpellier Square:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     FOR SALE
        THE LEASE OF THIS DESIRABLE RESIDENCE

        Enquire of Messrs. Lesson and Tukes,
             Court Street, Belgravia.
</pre>
    <p>
      It had sold within a week&mdash;that desirable residence, in the shadow of
      whose perfection a man and a woman had eaten their hearts out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a misty January evening, just before the board was taken down, Soames
      had gone there once more, and stood against the Square railings, looking
      at its unlighted windows, chewing the cud of possessive memories which had
      turned so bitter in the mouth. Why had she never loved him? Why? She had
      been given all she had wanted, and in return had given him, for three long
      years, all he had wanted&mdash;except, indeed, her heart. He had uttered a
      little involuntary groan, and a passing policeman had glanced suspiciously
      at him who no longer possessed the right to enter that green door with the
      carved brass knocker beneath the board &lsquo;For Sale!&rsquo; A choking
      sensation had attacked his throat, and he had hurried away into the mist.
      That evening he had gone to Brighton to live....
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching Malta Street, Soho, and the Restaurant Bretagne, where Annette
      would be drooping her pretty shoulders over her accounts, Soames thought
      with wonder of those seven years at Brighton. How had he managed to go on
      so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas, where he had not
      even space to put his treasures? True, those had been years with no time
      at all for looking at them&mdash;years of almost passionate money-making,
      during which Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte had become solicitors to more
      limited Companies than they could properly attend to. Up to the City of a
      morning in a Pullman car, down from the City of an evening in a Pullman
      car. Law papers again after dinner, then the sleep of the tired, and up
      again next morning. Saturday to Monday was spent at his Club in town&mdash;curious
      reversal of customary procedure, based on the deep and careful instinct
      that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice
      a day, and while resting must indulge his domestic affections. The Sunday
      visit to his family in Park Lane, to Timothy&rsquo;s, and to Green Street;
      the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health
      as sea air on weekdays. Even since his migration to Mapledurham he had
      maintained those habits until&mdash;he had known Annette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Annette had produced the revolution in his outlook, or that
      outlook had produced Annette, he knew no more than we know where a circle
      begins. It was intricate and deeply involved with the growing
      consciousness that property without anyone to leave it to is the negation
      of true Forsyteism. To have an heir, some continuance of self, who would
      begin where he left off&mdash;ensure, in fact, that he would not leave off&mdash;had
      quite obsessed him for the last year and more. After buying a bit of
      Wedgwood one evening in April, he had dropped into Malta Street to look at
      a house of his father&rsquo;s which had been turned into a restaurant&mdash;a
      risky proceeding, and one not quite in accordance with the terms of the
      lease. He had stared for a little at the outside painted a good cream
      colour, with two peacock-blue tubs containing little bay-trees in a
      recessed doorway&mdash;and at the words &lsquo;Restaurant Bretagne&rsquo;
      above them in gold letters, rather favourably impressed. Entering, he had
      noticed that several people were already seated at little round green
      tables with little pots of fresh flowers on them and Brittany-ware plates,
      and had asked of a trim waitress to see the proprietor. They had shown him
      into a back room, where a girl was sitting at a simple bureau covered with
      papers, and a small round, table was laid for two. The impression of
      cleanliness, order, and good taste was confirmed when the girl got up,
      saying, &ldquo;You wish to see Maman, Monsieur?&rdquo; in a broken accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Soames had answered, &ldquo;I represent your landlord;
      in fact, I&rsquo;m his son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, sir, please? Tell Maman to come to this
      gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pleased that the girl seemed impressed, because it showed business
      instinct; and suddenly he noticed that she was remarkably pretty&mdash;so
      remarkably pretty that his eyes found a difficulty in leaving her face.
      When she moved to put a chair for him, she swayed in a curious subtle way,
      as if she had been put together by someone with a special secret skill;
      and her face and neck, which was a little bared, looked as fresh as if
      they had been sprayed with dew. Probably at this moment Soames decided
      that the lease had not been violated; though to himself and his father he
      based the decision on the efficiency of those illicit adaptations in the
      building, on the signs of prosperity, and the obvious business capacity of
      Madame Lamotte. He did not, however, neglect to leave certain matters to
      future consideration, which had necessitated further visits, so that the
      little back room had become quite accustomed to his spare, not unsolid,
      but unobtrusive figure, and his pale, chinny face with clipped moustache
      and dark hair not yet grizzling at the sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Un Monsieur tres distingue,&rdquo; Madame Lamotte found him; and
      presently, &ldquo;Tres amical, tres gentil,&rdquo; watching his eyes upon
      her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was one of those generously built, fine-faced, dark-haired
      Frenchwomen, whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect
      confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes, their knowledge
      of cooking, and the careful increase of their bank balances.
    </p>
    <p>
      After those visits to the Restaurant Bretagne began, other visits ceased&mdash;without,
      indeed, any definite decision, for Soames, like all Forsytes, and the
      great majority of their countrymen, was a born empiricist. But it was this
      change in his mode of life which had gradually made him so definitely
      conscious that he desired to alter his condition from that of the
      unmarried married man to that of the married man remarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning into Malta Street on this evening of early October, 1899, he
      bought a paper to see if there were any after-development of the Dreyfus
      case&mdash;a question which he had always found useful in making closer
      acquaintanceship with Madame Lamotte and her daughter, who were Catholic
      and anti-Dreyfusard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanning those columns, Soames found nothing French, but noticed a general
      fall on the Stock Exchange and an ominous leader about the Transvaal. He
      entered, thinking: &lsquo;War&rsquo;s a certainty. I shall sell my
      consols.&rsquo; Not that he had many, personally, the rate of interest was
      too wretched; but he should advise his Companies&mdash;consols would
      assuredly go down. A look, as he passed the doorways of the restaurant,
      assured him that business was good as ever, and this, which in April would
      have pleased him, now gave him a certain uneasiness. If the steps which he
      had to take ended in his marrying Annette, he would rather see her mother
      safely back in France, a move to which the prosperity of the Restaurant
      Bretagne might become an obstacle. He would have to buy them out, of
      course, for French people only came to England to make money; and it would
      mean a higher price. And then that peculiar sweet sensation at the back of
      his throat, and a slight thumping about the heart, which he always
      experienced at the door of the little room, prevented his thinking how
      much it would cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going in, he was conscious of an abundant black skirt vanishing through
      the door into the restaurant, and of Annette with her hands up to her
      hair. It was the attitude in which of all others he admired her&mdash;so
      beautifully straight and rounded and supple. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just came in to talk to your mother about pulling down that
      partition. No, don&rsquo;t call her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will have supper with us? It will be ready in ten minutes.&rdquo;
      Soames, who still held her hand, was overcome by an impulse which
      surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look so pretty to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so very pretty.
      Do you know how pretty you look, Annette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette withdrew her hand, and blushed. &ldquo;Monsieur is very good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit good,&rdquo; said Soames, and sat down gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette made a little expressive gesture with her hands; a smile was
      crinkling her red lips untouched by salve.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, looking at those lips, Soames said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy over here, or do you want to go back to France?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like London. Paris, of course. But London is better than
      Orleans, and the English country is so beautiful. I have been to Richmond
      last Sunday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames went through a moment of calculating struggle. Mapledurham! Dared
      he? After all, dared he go so far as that, and show her what there was to
      look forward to! Still! Down there one could say things. In this room it
      was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you and your mother,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;to come
      for the afternoon next Sunday. My house is on the river, it&rsquo;s not
      too late in this weather; and I can show you some good pictures. What do
      you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be lovelee. The river is so beautiful&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s understood, then. I&rsquo;ll ask Madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He need say no more to her this evening, and risk giving himself away. But
      had he not already said too much? Did one ask restaurant proprietors with
      pretty daughters down to one&rsquo;s country house without design? Madame
      Lamotte would see, if Annette didn&rsquo;t. Well! there was not much that
      Madame did not see. Besides, this was the second time he had stayed to
      supper with them; he owed them hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking home towards Park Lane&mdash;for he was staying at his father&rsquo;s&mdash;with
      the impression of Annette&rsquo;s soft clever hand within his own, his
      thoughts were pleasant, slightly sensual, rather puzzled. Take steps! What
      steps? How? Dirty linen washed in public? Pah! With his reputation for
      sagacity, for far-sightedness and the clever extrication of others, he,
      who stood for proprietary interests, to become the plaything of that Law
      of which he was a pillar! There was something revolting in the thought!
      Winifred&rsquo;s affair was bad enough! To have a double dose of publicity
      in the family! Would not a liaison be better than that&mdash;a liaison,
      and a son he could adopt? But dark, solid, watchful, Madame Lamotte
      blocked the avenue of that vision. No! that would not work. It was not as
      if Annette could have a real passion for him; one could not expect that at
      his age. If her mother wished, if the worldly advantage were manifestly
      great&mdash;perhaps! If not, refusal would be certain. Besides, he
      thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a villain. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt her;
      and I don&rsquo;t want anything underhand. But I do want her, and I want a
      son! There&rsquo;s nothing for it but divorce&mdash;somehow&mdash;anyhow&mdash;divorce!&rsquo;
      Under the shadow of the plane-trees, in the lamplight, he passed slowly
      along the railings of the Green Park. Mist clung there among the bluish
      tree shapes, beyond range of the lamps. How many hundred times he had
      walked past those trees from his father&rsquo;s house in Park Lane, when
      he was quite a young man; or from his own house in Montpellier Square in
      those four years of married life! And, to-night, making up his mind to
      free himself if he could of that long useless marriage tie, he took a
      fancy to walk on, in at Hyde Park Corner, out at Knightsbridge Gate, just
      as he used to when going home to Irene in the old days. What could she be
      like now?&mdash;how had she passed the years since he last saw her, twelve
      years in all, seven already since Uncle Jolyon left her that money? Was
      she still beautiful? Would he know her if he saw her? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      not changed much,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I expect she has. She made me
      suffer.&rsquo; He remembered suddenly one night, the first on which he
      went out to dinner alone&mdash;an old Malburian dinner&mdash;the first
      year of their marriage. With what eagerness he had hurried back; and,
      entering softly as a cat, had heard her playing. Opening the drawing-room
      door noiselessly, he had stood watching the expression on her face,
      different from any he knew, so much more open, so confiding, as though to
      her music she was giving a heart he had never seen. And he remembered how
      she stopped and looked round, how her face changed back to that which he
      did know, and what an icy shiver had gone through him, for all that the
      next moment he was fondling her shoulders. Yes, she had made him suffer!
      Divorce! It seemed ridiculous, after all these years of utter separation!
      But it would have to be. No other way! &lsquo;The question,&rsquo; he
      thought with sudden realism, &lsquo;is&mdash;which of us? She or me? She
      deserted me. She ought to pay for it. There&rsquo;ll be someone, I
      suppose.&rsquo; Involuntarily he uttered a little snarling sound, and,
      turning, made his way back to Park Lane.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;JAMES SEES VISIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The butler himself opened the door, and closing it softly, detained Soames
      on the inner mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master&rsquo;s poorly, sir,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;He
      wouldn&rsquo;t go to bed till you came in. He&rsquo;s still in the
      diningroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames responded in the hushed tone to which the house was now accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him, Warmson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous, sir, I think. Might be the funeral; might be Mrs. Dartie&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo; round this afternoon. I think he overheard something. I&rsquo;ve
      took him in a negus. The mistress has just gone up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames hung his hat on a mahogany stag&rsquo;s-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Warmson, you can go to bed; I&rsquo;ll take him up
      myself.&rdquo; And he passed into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was sitting before the fire, in a big armchair, with a camel-hair
      shawl, very light and warm, over his frock-coated shoulders, on to which
      his long white whiskers drooped. His white hair, still fairly thick,
      glistened in the lamplight; a little moisture from his fixed, light-grey
      eyes stained the cheeks, still quite well coloured, and the long deep
      furrows running to the corners of the clean-shaven lips, which moved as if
      mumbling thoughts. His long legs, thin as a crow&rsquo;s, in shepherd&rsquo;s
      plaid trousers, were bent at less than a right angle, and on one knee a
      spindly hand moved continually, with fingers wide apart and glistening
      tapered nails. Beside him, on a low stool, stood a half-finished glass of
      negus, bedewed with beads of heat. There he had been sitting, with
      intervals for meals, all day. At eighty-eight he was still organically
      sound, but suffering terribly from the thought that no one ever told him
      anything. It is, indeed, doubtful how he had become aware that Roger was
      being buried that day, for Emily had kept it from him. She was always
      keeping things from him. Emily was only seventy! James had a grudge
      against his wife&rsquo;s youth. He felt sometimes that he would never have
      married her if he had known that she would have so many years before her,
      when he had so few. It was not natural. She would live fifteen or twenty
      years after he was gone, and might spend a lot of money; she had always
      had extravagant tastes. For all he knew she might want to buy one of these
      motor-cars. Cicely and Rachel and Imogen and all the young people&mdash;they
      all rode those bicycles now and went off Goodness knew where. And now
      Roger was gone. He didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t tell! The family
      was breaking up. Soames would know how much his uncle had left. Curiously
      he thought of Roger as Soames&rsquo; uncle not as his own brother. Soames!
      It was more and more the one solid spot in a vanishing world. Soames was
      careful; he was a warm man; but he had no one to leave his money to. There
      it was! He didn&rsquo;t know! And there was that fellow Chamberlain! For
      James&rsquo; political principles had been fixed between &lsquo;70 and
      &lsquo;85 when &lsquo;that rascally Radical&rsquo; had been the chief
      thorn in the side of property and he distrusted him to this day in spite
      of his conversion; he would get the country into a mess and make money go
      down before he had done with it. A stormy petrel of a chap! Where was
      Soames? He had gone to the funeral of course which they had tried to keep
      from him. He knew that perfectly well; he had seen his son&rsquo;s
      trousers. Roger! Roger in his coffin! He remembered how, when they came up
      from school together from the West, on the box seat of the old Slowflyer
      in 1824, Roger had got into the &lsquo;boot&rsquo; and gone to sleep.
      James uttered a thin cackle. A funny fellow&mdash;Roger&mdash;an original!
      He didn&rsquo;t know! Younger than himself, and in his coffin! The family
      was breaking up. There was Val going to the university; he never came to
      see him now. He would cost a pretty penny up there. It was an extravagant
      age. And all the pretty pennies that his four grandchildren would cost him
      danced before James&rsquo; eyes. He did not grudge them the money, but he
      grudged terribly the risk which the spending of that money might bring on
      them; he grudged the diminution of security. And now that Cicely had
      married, she might be having children too. He didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      tell! Nobody thought of anything but spending money in these days, and
      racing about, and having what they called &lsquo;a good time.&rsquo; A
      motor-car went past the window. Ugly great lumbering thing, making all
      that racket! But there it was, the country rattling to the dogs! People in
      such a hurry that they couldn&rsquo;t even care for style&mdash;a neat
      turnout like his barouche and bays was worth all those new-fangled things.
      And consols at 116! There must be a lot of money in the country. And now
      there was this old Kruger! They had tried to keep old Kruger from him. But
      he knew better; there would be a pretty kettle of fish out there! He had
      known how it would be when that fellow Gladstone&mdash;dead now, thank
      God! made such a mess of it after that dreadful business at Majuba. He
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the Empire split up and went to pot. And this
      vision of the Empire going to pot filled a full quarter of an hour with
      qualms of the most serious character. He had eaten a poor lunch because of
      them. But it was after lunch that the real disaster to his nerves
      occurred. He had been dozing when he became aware of voices&mdash;low
      voices. Ah! they never told him anything! Winifred&rsquo;s and her mother&rsquo;s.
      &ldquo;Monty!&rdquo; That fellow Dartie&mdash;always that fellow Dartie!
      The voices had receded; and James had been left alone, with his ears
      standing up like a hare&rsquo;s, and fear creeping about his inwards. Why
      did they leave him alone? Why didn&rsquo;t they come and tell him? And an
      awful thought, which through long years had haunted him, concreted again
      swiftly in his brain. Dartie had gone bankrupt&mdash;fraudulently
      bankrupt, and to save Winifred and the children, he&mdash;James&mdash;would
      have to pay! Could he&mdash;could Soames turn him into a limited company?
      No, he couldn&rsquo;t! There it was! With every minute before Emily came
      back the spectre fiercened. Why, it might be forgery! With eyes fixed on
      the doubted Turner in the centre of the wall, James suffered tortures. He
      saw Dartie in the dock, his grandchildren in the gutter, and himself in
      bed. He saw the doubted Turner being sold at Jobson&rsquo;s, and all the
      majestic edifice of property in rags. He saw in fancy Winifred
      unfashionably dressed, and heard in fancy Emily&rsquo;s voice saying:
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t fuss, James!&rdquo; She was always saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      fuss!&rdquo; She had no nerves; he ought never to have married a woman
      eighteen years younger than himself. Then Emily&rsquo;s real voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a nice nap, James?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nap! He was in torment, and she asked him that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about Dartie?&rdquo; he said, and his eyes glared
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily&rsquo;s self-possession never deserted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been hearing?&rdquo; she asked blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about Dartie?&rdquo; repeated James. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      gone bankrupt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James made a great effort, and rose to the full height of his stork-like
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never tell me anything,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone
      bankrupt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The destruction of that fixed idea seemed to Emily all that mattered at
      the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; she answered firmly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to
      Buenos Aires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had said &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to Mars&rdquo; she could not have
      dealt James a more stunning blow; his imagination, invested entirely in
      British securities, could as little grasp one place as the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he gone there for?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      got no money. What did he take?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agitated within by Winifred&rsquo;s news, and goaded by the constant
      reiteration of this jeremiad, Emily said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took Winifred&rsquo;s pearls and a dancer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said James, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sudden collapse alarmed her, and smoothing his forehead, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t fuss, James!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dusky red had spread over James&rsquo; cheeks and forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid for them,&rdquo; he said tremblingly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
      thief! I&mdash;I knew how it would be. He&rsquo;ll be the death of me; he
      ....&rdquo; Words failed him and he sat quite still. Emily, who thought
      she knew him so well, was alarmed, and went towards the sideboard where
      she kept some sal volatile. She could not see the tenacious Forsyte spirit
      working in that thin, tremulous shape against the extravagance of the
      emotion called up by this outrage on Forsyte principles&mdash;the Forsyte
      spirit deep in there, saying: &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t get into a fantod,
      it&rsquo;ll never do. You won&rsquo;t digest your lunch. You&rsquo;ll have
      a fit!&rsquo; All unseen by her, it was doing better work in James than
      sal volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      James waved it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was Winifred about,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to let him take her
      pearls?&rdquo; Emily perceived the crisis past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can have mine,&rdquo; she said comfortably. &ldquo;I never wear
      them. She&rsquo;d better get a divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Divorce! We&rsquo;ve never
      had a divorce in the family. Where&rsquo;s Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be in directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said James, almost fiercely; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      at the funeral. You think I know nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emily with calm, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t get
      into such fusses when we tell you things.&rdquo; And plumping up his
      cushions, and putting the sal volatile beside him, she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But James sat there seeing visions&mdash;of Winifred in the Divorce Court,
      and the family name in the papers; of the earth falling on Roger&rsquo;s
      coffin; of Val taking after his father; of the pearls he had paid for and
      would never see again; of money back at four per cent., and the country
      going to the dogs; and, as the afternoon wore into evening, and tea-time
      passed, and dinnertime, those visions became more and more mixed and
      menacing&mdash;of being told nothing, till he had nothing left of all his
      wealth, and they told him nothing of it. Where was Soames? Why didn&rsquo;t
      he come in?... His hand grasped the glass of negus, he raised it to drink,
      and saw his son standing there looking at him. A little sigh of relief
      escaped his lips, and putting the glass down, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! Dartie&rsquo;s gone to Buenos Aires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;good
      riddance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of assuagement passed over James&rsquo; brain. Soames knew. Soames
      was the only one of them all who had sense. Why couldn&rsquo;t he come and
      live at home? He had no son of his own. And he said plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my age I get nervous. I wish you were more at home, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Soames nodded; the mask of his countenance betrayed no
      understanding, but he went closer, and as if by accident touched his
      father&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sent their love to you at Timothy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;It went off all right. I&rsquo;ve been to see Winifred. I&rsquo;m
      going to take steps.&rdquo; And he thought: &lsquo;Yes, and you mustn&rsquo;t
      hear of them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked up; his long white whiskers quivered, his thin throat between
      the points of his collar looked very gristly and naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very poorly all day,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they
      never tell me anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo; heart twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.
      Will you come up now?&rdquo; and he put his hand under his father&rsquo;s
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      James obediently and tremulously raised himself, and together they went
      slowly across the room, which had a rich look in the firelight, and out to
      the stairs. Very slowly they ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, my boy,&rdquo; said James at his bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, father,&rdquo; answered Soames. His hand stroked down
      the sleeve beneath the shawl; it seemed to have almost nothing in it, so
      thin was the arm. And, turning away from the light in the opening doorway,
      he went up the extra flight to his own bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want a son,&rsquo; he thought, sitting on the edge of his bed;
      &lsquo;I want a son.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;NO-LONGER-YOUNG JOLYON AT HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Trees take little account of time, and the old oak on the upper lawn at
      Robin Hill looked no day older than when Bosinney sprawled under it and
      said to Soames: &ldquo;Forsyte, I&rsquo;ve found the very place for your
      house.&rdquo; Since then Swithin had dreamed, and old Jolyon died, beneath
      its branches. And now, close to the swing, no-longer-young Jolyon often
      painted there. Of all spots in the world it was perhaps the most sacred to
      him, for he had loved his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemplating its great girth&mdash;crinkled and a little mossed, but not
      yet hollow&mdash;he would speculate on the passage of time. That tree had
      seen, perhaps, all real English history; it dated, he shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder, from the days of Elizabeth at least. His own fifty years were as
      nothing to its wood. When the house behind it, which he now owned, was
      three hundred years of age instead of twelve, that tree might still be
      standing there, vast and hollow&mdash;for who would commit such sacrilege
      as to cut it down? A Forsyte might perhaps still be living in that house,
      to guard it jealously. And Jolyon would wonder what the house would look
      like coated with such age. Wistaria was already about its walls&mdash;the
      new look had gone. Would it hold its own and keep the dignity Bosinney had
      bestowed on it, or would the giant London have lapped it round and made it
      into an asylum in the midst of a jerry-built wilderness? Often, within and
      without of it, he was persuaded that Bosinney had been moved by the spirit
      when he built. He had put his heart into that house, indeed! It might even
      become one of the &lsquo;homes of England&rsquo;&mdash;a rare achievement
      for a house in these degenerate days of building. And the aesthetic
      spirit, moving hand in hand with his Forsyte sense of possessive
      continuity, dwelt with pride and pleasure on his ownership thereof. There
      was the smack of reverence and ancestor-worship (if only for one ancestor)
      in his desire to hand this house down to his son and his son&rsquo;s son.
      His father had loved the house, had loved the view, the grounds, that
      tree; his last years had been happy there, and no one had lived there
      before him. These last eleven years at Robin Hill had formed in Jolyon&rsquo;s
      life as a painter, the important period of success. He was now in the very
      van of water-colour art, hanging on the line everywhere. His drawings
      fetched high prices. Specialising in that one medium with the tenacity of
      his breed, he had &lsquo;arrived&rsquo;&mdash;rather late, but not too
      late for a member of the family which made a point of living for ever. His
      art had really deepened and improved. In conformity with his position he
      had grown a short fair beard, which was just beginning to grizzle, and hid
      his Forsyte chin; his brown face had lost the warped expression of his
      ostracised period&mdash;he looked, if anything, younger. The loss of his
      wife in 1894 had been one of those domestic tragedies which turn out in
      the end for the good of all. He had, indeed, loved her to the last, for
      his was an affectionate spirit, but she had become increasingly difficult:
      jealous of her step-daughter June, jealous even of her own little daughter
      Holly, and making ceaseless plaint that he could not love her, ill as she
      was, and &lsquo;useless to everyone, and better dead.&rsquo; He had
      mourned her sincerely, but his face had looked younger since she died. If
      she could only have believed that she made him happy, how much happier
      would the twenty years of their companionship have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      June had never really got on well with her who had reprehensibly taken her
      own mother&rsquo;s place; and ever since old Jolyon died she had been
      established in a sort of studio in London. But she had come back to Robin
      Hill on her stepmother&rsquo;s death, and gathered the reins there into
      her small decided hands. Jolly was then at Harrow; Holly still learning
      from Mademoiselle Beauce. There had been nothing to keep Jolyon at home,
      and he had removed his grief and his paint-box abroad. There he had
      wandered, for the most part in Brittany, and at last had fetched up in
      Paris. He had stayed there several months, and come back with the younger
      face and the short fair beard. Essentially a man who merely lodged in any
      house, it had suited him perfectly that June should reign at Robin Hill,
      so that he was free to go off with his easel where and when he liked. She
      was inclined, it is true, to regard the house rather as an asylum for her
      proteges! but his own outcast days had filled Jolyon for ever with
      sympathy towards an outcast, and June&rsquo;s &lsquo;lame ducks&rsquo;
      about the place did not annoy him. By all means let her have them down&mdash;and
      feed them up; and though his slightly cynical humour perceived that they
      ministered to his daughter&rsquo;s love of domination as well as moved her
      warm heart, he never ceased to admire her for having so many ducks. He
      fell, indeed, year by year into a more and more detached and brotherly
      attitude towards his own son and daughters, treating them with a sort of
      whimsical equality. When he went down to Harrow to see Jolly, he never
      quite knew which of them was the elder, and would sit eating cherries with
      him out of one paper bag, with an affectionate and ironical smile twisting
      up an eyebrow and curling his lips a little. And he was always careful to
      have money in his pocket, and to be modish in his dress, so that his son
      need not blush for him. They were perfect friends, but never seemed to
      have occasion for verbal confidences, both having the competitive
      self-consciousness of Forsytes. They knew they would stand by each other
      in scrapes, but there was no need to talk about it. Jolyon had a striking
      horror&mdash;partly original sin, but partly the result of his early
      immorality&mdash;of the moral attitude. The most he could ever have said
      to his son would have been:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man; don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo;
      and then have wondered whimsically whether that was not a snobbish
      sentiment. The great cricket match was perhaps the most searching and
      awkward time they annually went through together, for Jolyon had been at
      Eton. They would be particularly careful during that match, continually
      saying: &ldquo;Hooray! Oh! hard luck, old man!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hooray!
      Oh! bad luck, Dad!&rdquo; to each other, when some disaster at which their
      hearts bounded happened to the opposing school. And Jolyon would wear a
      grey top hat, instead of his usual soft one, to save his son&rsquo;s
      feelings, for a black top hat he could not stomach. When Jolly went up to
      Oxford, Jolyon went up with him, amused, humble, and a little anxious not
      to discredit his boy amongst all these youths who seemed so much more
      assured and old than himself. He often thought, &lsquo;Glad I&rsquo;m a
      painter&rsquo; for he had long dropped under-writing at Lloyds&mdash;&rsquo;it&rsquo;s
      so innocuous. You can&rsquo;t look down on a painter&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
      take him seriously enough.&rsquo; For Jolly, who had a sort of natural
      lordliness, had passed at once into a very small set, who secretly amused
      his father. The boy had fair hair which curled a little, and his
      grandfather&rsquo;s deepset iron-grey eyes. He was well-built and very
      upright, and always pleased Jolyon&rsquo;s aesthetic sense, so that he was
      a tiny bit afraid of him, as artists ever are of those of their own sex
      whom they admire physically. On that occasion, however, he actually did
      screw up his courage to give his son advice, and this was it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man, you&rsquo;re bound to get into debt; mind you
      come to me at once. Of course, I&rsquo;ll always pay them. But you might
      remember that one respects oneself more afterwards if one pays one&rsquo;s
      own way. And don&rsquo;t ever borrow, except from me, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jolly had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Dad, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and he never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s just one other thing. I don&rsquo;t know much
      about morality and that, but there is this: It&rsquo;s always worth while
      before you do anything to consider whether it&rsquo;s going to hurt
      another person more than is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly had looked thoughtful, and nodded, and presently had squeezed his
      father&rsquo;s hand. And Jolyon had thought: &lsquo;I wonder if I had the
      right to say that?&rsquo; He always had a sort of dread of losing the dumb
      confidence they had in each other; remembering how for long years he had
      lost his own father&rsquo;s, so that there had been nothing between them
      but love at a great distance. He under-estimated, no doubt, the change in
      the spirit of the age since he himself went up to Cambridge in &lsquo;65;
      and perhaps he underestimated, too, his boy&rsquo;s power of understanding
      that he was tolerant to the very bone. It was that tolerance of his, and
      possibly his scepticism, which ever made his relations towards June so
      queerly defensive. She was such a decided mortal; knew her own mind so
      terribly well; wanted things so inexorably until she got them&mdash;and
      then, indeed, often dropped them like a hot potato. Her mother had been
      like that, whence had come all those tears. Not that his incompatibility
      with his daughter was anything like what it had been with the first Mrs.
      Young Jolyon. One could be amused where a daughter was concerned; in a
      wife&rsquo;s case one could not be amused. To see June set her heart and
      jaw on a thing until she got it was all right, because it was never
      anything which interfered fundamentally with Jolyon&rsquo;s liberty&mdash;the
      one thing on which his jaw was also absolutely rigid, a considerable jaw,
      under that short grizzling beard. Nor was there ever any necessity for
      real heart-to-heart encounters. One could break away into irony&mdash;as
      indeed he often had to. But the real trouble with June was that she had
      never appealed to his aesthetic sense, though she might well have, with
      her red-gold hair and her viking-coloured eyes, and that touch of the
      Berserker in her spirit. It was very different with Holly, soft and quiet,
      shy and affectionate, with a playful imp in her somewhere. He watched this
      younger daughter of his through the duckling stage with extraordinary
      interest. Would she come out a swan? With her sallow oval face and her
      grey wistful eyes and those long dark lashes, she might, or she might not.
      Only this last year had he been able to guess. Yes, she would be a swan&mdash;rather
      a dark one, always a shy one, but an authentic swan. She was eighteen now,
      and Mademoiselle Beauce was gone&mdash;the excellent lady had removed,
      after eleven years haunted by her continuous reminiscences of the &lsquo;well-brrred
      little Tayleurs,&rsquo; to another family whose bosom would now be
      agitated by her reminiscences of the &lsquo;well-brrred little Forsytes.&rsquo;
      She had taught Holly to speak French like herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portraiture was not Jolyon&rsquo;s forte, but he had already drawn his
      younger daughter three times, and was drawing her a fourth, on the
      afternoon of October 4th, 1899, when a card was brought to him which
      caused his eyebrows to go up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        MR. SOAMES FORSYTE

   THE SHELTER, CONNOISSEURS CLUB,

     MAPLEDURHAM. ST. JAMES&rsquo;S.
</pre>
    <p>
      But here the Forsyte Saga must digress again....
    </p>
    <p>
      To return from a long travel in Spain to a darkened house, to a little
      daughter bewildered with tears, to the sight of a loved father lying
      peaceful in his last sleep, had never been, was never likely to be,
      forgotten by so impressionable and warm-hearted a man as Jolyon. A sense
      as of mystery, too, clung to that sad day, and about the end of one whose
      life had been so well-ordered, balanced, and above-board. It seemed
      incredible that his father could thus have vanished without, as it were,
      announcing his intention, without last words to his son, and due
      farewells. And those incoherent allusions of little Holly to &lsquo;the
      lady in grey,&rsquo; of Mademoiselle Beauce to a Madame Errant (as it
      sounded) involved all things in a mist, lifted a little when he read his
      father&rsquo;s will and the codicil thereto. It had been his duty as
      executor of that will and codicil to inform Irene, wife of his cousin
      Soames, of her life interest in fifteen thousand pounds. He had called on
      her to explain that the existing investment in India Stock, ear-marked to
      meet the charge, would produce for her the interesting net sum of L430 odd
      a year, clear of income tax. This was but the third time he had seen his
      cousin Soames&rsquo; wife&mdash;if indeed she was still his wife, of which
      he was not quite sure. He remembered having seen her sitting in the
      Botanical Gardens waiting for Bosinney&mdash;a passive, fascinating
      figure, reminding him of Titian&rsquo;s &lsquo;Heavenly Love,&rsquo; and
      again, when, charged by his father, he had gone to Montpellier Square on
      the afternoon when Bosinney&rsquo;s death was known. He still recalled
      vividly her sudden appearance in the drawing-room doorway on that occasion&mdash;her
      beautiful face, passing from wild eagerness of hope to stony despair;
      remembered the compassion he had felt, Soames&rsquo; snarling smile, his
      words, &ldquo;We are not at home!&rdquo; and the slam of the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This third time he saw a face and form more beautiful&mdash;freed from
      that warp of wild hope and despair. Looking at her, he thought: &lsquo;Yes,
      you are just what the Dad would have admired!&rsquo; And the strange story
      of his father&rsquo;s Indian summer became slowly clear to him. She spoke
      of old Jolyon with reverence and tears in her eyes. &ldquo;He was so
      wonderfully kind to me; I don&rsquo;t know why. He looked so beautiful and
      peaceful sitting in that chair under the tree; it was I who first came on
      him sitting there, you know. Such a lovely day. I don&rsquo;t think an end
      could have been happier. We should all like to go out like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right!&rsquo; he had thought. &lsquo;We should all a like to
      go out in full summer with beauty stepping towards us across a lawn.&rsquo;
      And looking round the little, almost empty drawing-room, he had asked her
      what she was going to do now. &ldquo;I am going to live again a little,
      Cousin Jolyon. It&rsquo;s wonderful to have money of one&rsquo;s own. I&rsquo;ve
      never had any. I shall keep this flat, I think; I&rsquo;m used to it; but
      I shall be able to go to Italy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Jolyon had murmured, looking at her faintly smiling
      lips; and he had gone away thinking: &lsquo;A fascinating woman! What a
      waste! I&rsquo;m glad the Dad left her that money.&rsquo; He had not seen
      her again, but every quarter he had signed her cheque, forwarding it to
      her bank, with a note to the Chelsea flat to say that he had done so; and
      always he had received a note in acknowledgment, generally from the flat,
      but sometimes from Italy; so that her personality had become embodied in
      slightly scented grey paper, an upright fine handwriting, and the words,
      &lsquo;Dear Cousin Jolyon.&rsquo; Man of property that he now was, the
      slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought: &lsquo;Well, I
      suppose she just manages&rsquo;. sliding into a vague wonder how she was
      faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed.
      At first Holly had spoken of her sometimes, but &lsquo;ladies in grey&rsquo;
      soon fade from children&rsquo;s memories; and the tightening of June&rsquo;s
      lips in those first weeks after her grandfather&rsquo;s death whenever her
      former friend&rsquo;s name was mentioned, had discouraged allusion. Only
      once, indeed, had June spoken definitely: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgiven her.
      I&rsquo;m frightfully glad she&rsquo;s independent now....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving Soames&rsquo; card, Jolyon said to the maid&mdash;for he
      could not abide butlers&mdash;&ldquo;Show him into the study, please, and
      say I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute&rdquo;; and then he looked at Holly
      and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember &lsquo;the lady in grey,&rsquo; who used to give
      you music-lessons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, why? Has she come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon shook his head, and, changing his holland blouse for a coat, was
      silent, perceiving suddenly that such history was not for those young
      ears. His face, in fact, became whimsical perplexity incarnate while he
      journeyed towards the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing by the french-window, looking out across the terrace at the oak
      tree, were two figures, middle-aged and young, and he thought: &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      that boy? Surely they never had a child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder figure turned. The meeting of those two Forsytes of the second
      generation, so much more sophisticated than the first, in the house built
      for the one and owned and occupied by the other, was marked by subtle
      defensiveness beneath distinct attempt at cordiality. &lsquo;Has he come
      about his wife?&rsquo; Jolyon was thinking; and Soames, &lsquo;How shall I
      begin?&rsquo; while Val, brought to break the ice, stood negligently
      scrutinising this &lsquo;bearded pard&rsquo; from under his dark, thick
      eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Val Dartie,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;my sister&rsquo;s
      son. He&rsquo;s just going up to Oxford. I thought I&rsquo;d like him to
      know your boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m sorry Jolly&rsquo;s away. What college?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B.N.C.,&rdquo; replied Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly&rsquo;s at the &lsquo;House,&rsquo; but he&rsquo;ll be
      delighted to look you up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks awfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holly&rsquo;s in&mdash;if you could put up with a female relation,
      she&rsquo;d show you round. You&rsquo;ll find her in the hall if you go
      through the curtains. I was just painting her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With another &ldquo;Thanks, awfully!&rdquo; Val vanished, leaving the two
      cousins with the ice unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve some drawings at the &lsquo;Water Colours,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon winced. He had been out of touch with the Forsyte family at large
      for twenty-six years, but they were connected in his mind with Frith&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Derby Day&rsquo; and Landseer prints. He had heard from June that
      Soames was a connoisseur, which made it worse. He had become aware, too,
      of a curious sensation of repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Soames between close lips, &ldquo;not since&mdash;as
      a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s about that I&rsquo;ve come. You&rsquo;re her
      trustee, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years is a long time,&rdquo; said Soames rapidly: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      tired of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon found no more appropriate answer than:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you smoke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon himself lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to be free,&rdquo; said Soames abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see her,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon through the fume of
      his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know where she lives, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon nodded. He did not mean to give her address without permission.
      Soames seemed to divine his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her address,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exactly do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She deserted me. I want a divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather late in the day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames. And there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about these things&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten,&rdquo; said Jolyon with a wry smile. He himself had had to wait
      for death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon. &ldquo;Do you
      wish me to see her about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames raised his eyes to his cousin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s
      someone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrug moved Jolyon&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all. I imagine you may have both lived as if
      the other were dead. It&rsquo;s usual in these cases.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned to the window. A few early fallen oak-leaves strewed the
      terrace already, and were rolling round in the wind. Jolyon saw the
      figures of Holly and Val Dartie moving across the lawn towards the
      stables. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to run with the hare and hunt with the
      hounds,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I must act for her. The Dad would have
      wished that.&rsquo; And for a swift moment he seemed to see his father&rsquo;s
      figure in the old armchair, just beyond Soames, sitting with knees
      crossed, The Times in his hand. It vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was fond of her,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he should have been I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Soames answered
      without looking round. &ldquo;She brought trouble to your daughter June;
      she brought trouble to everyone. I gave her all she wanted. I would have
      given her even&mdash;forgiveness&mdash;but she chose to leave me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Jolyon compassion was checked by the tone of that close voice. What was
      there in the fellow that made it so difficult to be sorry for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go and see her, if you like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose
      she might be glad of a divorce, but I know nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please go. As I say, I know her address; but I&rsquo;ve no
      wish to see her.&rdquo; His tongue was busy with his lips, as if they were
      very dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have some tea?&rdquo; said Jolyon, stifling the words:
      &lsquo;And see the house.&rsquo; And he led the way into the hall. When he
      had rung the bell and ordered tea, he went to his easel to turn his
      drawing to the wall. He could not bear, somehow, that his work should be
      seen by Soames, who was standing there in the middle of the great room
      which had been designed expressly to afford wall space for his own
      pictures. In his cousin&rsquo;s face, with its unseizable family likeness
      to himself, and its chinny, narrow, concentrated look, Jolyon saw that
      which moved him to the thought: &lsquo;That chap could never forget
      anything&mdash;nor ever give himself away. He&rsquo;s pathetic!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE COLT AND THE FILLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When young Val left the presence of the last generation he was thinking:
      &lsquo;This is jolly dull! Uncle Soames does take the bun. I wonder what
      this filly&rsquo;s like?&rsquo; He anticipated no pleasure from her
      society; and suddenly he saw her standing there looking at him. Why, she
      was pretty! What luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
      name&rsquo;s Val Dartie&mdash;I&rsquo;m once removed, second cousin,
      something like that, you know. My mother&rsquo;s name was Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly, whose slim brown hand remained in his because she was too shy to
      withdraw it, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any of my relations. Are there many?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tons. They&rsquo;re awful&mdash;most of them. At least, I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;some of them. One&rsquo;s relations always are, aren&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect they think one awful too,&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they should. No one could think you awful,
      of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly looked at him&mdash;the wistful candour in those grey eyes gave
      young Val a sudden feeling that he must protect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean there are people and people,&rdquo; he added astutely.
      &ldquo;Your dad looks awfully decent, for instance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said Holly fervently; &ldquo;he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush mounted in Val&rsquo;s cheeks&mdash;that scene in the Pandemonium
      promenade&mdash;the dark man with the pink carnation developing into his
      own father! &ldquo;But you know what the Forsytes are,&rdquo; he said
      almost viciously. &ldquo;Oh! I forgot; you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! fearfully careful; not sportsmen a bit. Look at Uncle Soames!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val resisted a desire to run his arm through hers. &ldquo;Oh! no,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go out. You&rsquo;ll see him quite soon
      enough. What&rsquo;s your brother like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly led the way on to the terrace and down to the lawn without
      answering. How describe Jolly, who, ever since she remembered anything,
      had been her lord, master, and ideal?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he sit on you?&rdquo; said Val shrewdly. &ldquo;I shall be
      knowing him at Oxford. Have you got any horses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly nodded. &ldquo;Would you like to see the stables?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed under the oak tree, through a thin shrubbery, into the
      stable-yard. There under a clock-tower lay a fluffy brown-and-white dog,
      so old that he did not get up, but faintly waved the tail curled over his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Balthasar,&rdquo; said Holly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s so old&mdash;awfully
      old, nearly as old as I am. Poor old boy! He&rsquo;s devoted to Dad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Balthasar! That&rsquo;s a rum name. He isn&rsquo;t purebred you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! but he&rsquo;s a darling,&rdquo; and she bent down to stroke
      the dog. Gentle and supple, with dark covered head and slim browned neck
      and hands, she seemed to Val strange and sweet, like a thing slipped
      between him and all previous knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When grandfather died,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t
      eat for two days. He saw him die, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that old Uncle Jolyon? Mother always says he was a topper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; said Holly simply, and opened the stable door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a loose-box stood a silver roan of about fifteen hands, with a long
      black tail and mane. &ldquo;This is mine&mdash;Fairy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Val, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a jolly palfrey. But you
      ought to bang her tail. She&rsquo;d look much smarter.&rdquo; Then
      catching her wondering look, he thought suddenly: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;anything she likes!&rsquo; And he took a long sniff of the
      stable air. &ldquo;Horses are ripping, aren&rsquo;t they? My Dad...&rdquo;
      he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impulse to unbosom himself almost overcame him&mdash;but not quite.
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s often gone a mucker over them. I&rsquo;m
      jolly keen on them too&mdash;riding and hunting. I like racing awfully, as
      well; I should like to be a gentleman rider.&rdquo; And oblivious of the
      fact that he had but one more day in town, with two engagements, he
      plumped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, if I hire a gee to-morrow, will you come a ride in Richmond
      Park?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I simply love riding. But there&rsquo;s Jolly&rsquo;s
      horse; why don&rsquo;t you ride him? Here he is. We could go after tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked doubtfully at his trousered legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had imagined them immaculate before her eyes in high brown boots and
      Bedford cords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like riding his horse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
      mightn&rsquo;t like it. Besides, Uncle Soames wants to get back, I expect.
      Not that I believe in buckling under to him, you know. You haven&rsquo;t
      got an uncle, have you? This is rather a good beast,&rdquo; he added,
      scrutinising Jolly&rsquo;s horse, a dark brown, which was showing the
      whites of its eyes. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got any hunting here, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t know that I want to hunt. It must be awfully
      exciting, of course; but it&rsquo;s cruel, isn&rsquo;t it? June says so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel?&rdquo; ejaculated Val. &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all rot. Who&rsquo;s
      June?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister&mdash;my half-sister, you know&mdash;much older than me.&rdquo;
      She had put her hands up to both cheeks of Jolly&rsquo;s horse, and was
      rubbing her nose against its nose with a gentle snuffling noise which
      seemed to have an hypnotic effect on the animal. Val contemplated her
      cheek resting against the horse&rsquo;s nose, and her eyes gleaming round
      at him. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s really a duck,&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the house less talkative, followed this time by the dog Balthasar,
      walking more slowly than anything on earth, and clearly expecting them not
      to exceed his speed limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a ripping place,&rdquo; said Val from under the oak tree,
      where they had paused to allow the dog Balthasar to come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Holly, and sighed. &ldquo;Of course I want to go
      everywhere. I wish I were a gipsy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gipsies are jolly,&rdquo; replied Val, with a conviction which
      had just come to him; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re rather like one, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly&rsquo;s face shone suddenly and deeply, like dark leaves gilded by
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go mad-rabbiting everywhere and see everything, and live in the
      open&mdash;oh! wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; said Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be grand sport, just you and I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Holly perceived the quaintness and gushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to do it,&rdquo; said Val obstinately, but
      reddening too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in doing things you want to do. What&rsquo;s down there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kitchen-garden, and the pond and the coppice, and the farm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly glanced back at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tea-time, I expect; there&rsquo;s Dad beckoning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val, uttering a growly sound, followed her towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they re-entered the hall gallery the sight of two middle-aged
      Forsytes drinking tea together had its magical effect, and they became
      quite silent. It was, indeed, an impressive spectacle. The two were seated
      side by side on an arrangement in marqueterie which looked like three
      silvery pink chairs made one, with a low tea-table in front of them. They
      seemed to have taken up that position, as far apart as the seat would
      permit, so that they need not look at each other too much; and they were
      eating and drinking rather than talking&mdash;Soames with his air of
      despising the tea-cake as it disappeared, Jolyon of finding himself
      slightly amusing. To the casual eye neither would have seemed greedy, but
      both were getting through a good deal of sustenance. The two young ones
      having been supplied with food, the process went on silent and
      absorbative, till, with the advent of cigarettes, Jolyon said to Soames:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s Uncle James?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, very shaky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a wonderful family, aren&rsquo;t we? The other day I
      was calculating the average age of the ten old Forsytes from my father&rsquo;s
      family Bible. I make it eighty-four already, and five still living. They
      ought to beat the record;&rdquo; and looking whimsically at Soames, he
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t the men they were, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled. &lsquo;Do you really think I shall admit that I&rsquo;m not
      their equal&rsquo;. he seemed to be saying, &lsquo;or that I&rsquo;ve got
      to give up anything, especially life?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may live to their age, perhaps,&rdquo; pursued Jolyon, &ldquo;but
      self-consciousness is a handicap, you know, and that&rsquo;s the
      difference between us. We&rsquo;ve lost conviction. How and when
      self-consciousness was born I never can make out. My father had a little,
      but I don&rsquo;t believe any other of the old Forsytes ever had a scrap.
      Never to see yourself as others see you, it&rsquo;s a wonderful
      preservative. The whole history of the last century is in the difference
      between us. And between us and you,&rdquo; he added, gazing through a ring
      of smoke at Val and Holly, uncomfortable under his quizzical regard,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be&mdash;another difference. I wonder what.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re to catch our
      train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Soames never misses a train,&rdquo; muttered Val, with his
      mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; Soames answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; grumbled Val, &ldquo;other people
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the front door he gave Holly&rsquo;s slim brown hand a long and
      surreptitious squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for me to-morrow,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;three o&rsquo;clock.
      I&rsquo;ll wait for you in the road; it&rsquo;ll save time. We&rsquo;ll
      have a ripping ride.&rdquo; He gazed back at her from the lodge gate, and,
      but for the principles of a man about town, would have waved his hand. He
      felt in no mood to tolerate his uncle&rsquo;s conversation. But he was not
      in danger. Soames preserved a perfect muteness, busy with far-away
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow leaves came down about those two walking the mile and a half
      which Soames had traversed so often in those long-ago days when he came
      down to watch with secret pride the building of the house&mdash;that house
      which was to have been the home of him and her from whom he was now going
      to seek release. He looked back once, up that endless vista of autumn lane
      between the yellowing hedges. What an age ago! &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to see her,&rdquo; he had said to Jolyon. Was that true? &lsquo;I may have
      to,&rsquo; he thought; and he shivered, seized by one of those queer
      shudderings that they say mean footsteps on one&rsquo;s grave. A chilly
      world! A queer world! And glancing sidelong at his nephew, he thought:
      &lsquo;Wish I were his age! I wonder what she&rsquo;s like now!&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;JOLYON PROSECUTES TRUSTEESHIP
    </h2>
    <p>
      When those two were gone Jolyon did not return to his painting, for
      daylight was failing, but went to the study, craving unconsciously a
      revival of that momentary vision of his father sitting in the old leather
      chair with his knees crossed and his straight eyes gazing up from under
      the dome of his massive brow. Often in this little room, cosiest in the
      house, Jolyon would catch a moment of communion with his father. Not,
      indeed, that he had definitely any faith in the persistence of the human
      spirit&mdash;the feeling was not so logical&mdash;it was, rather, an
      atmospheric impact, like a scent, or one of those strong animistic
      impressions from forms, or effects of light, to which those with the
      artist&rsquo;s eye are especially prone. Here only&mdash;in this little
      unchanged room where his father had spent the most of his waking hours&mdash;could
      be retrieved the feeling that he was not quite gone, that the steady
      counsel of that old spirit and the warmth of his masterful lovability
      endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would his father be advising now, in this sudden recrudescence of an
      old tragedy&mdash;what would he say to this menace against her to whom he
      had taken such a fancy in the last weeks of his life? &lsquo;I must do my
      best for her,&rsquo; thought Jolyon; &lsquo;he left her to me in his will.
      But what is the best?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if seeking to regain the sapience, the balance and shrewd common
      sense of that old Forsyte, he sat down in the ancient chair and crossed
      his knees. But he felt a mere shadow sitting there; nor did any
      inspiration come, while the fingers of the wind tapped on the darkening
      panes of the french-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go and see her?&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;or ask her to come down
      here? What&rsquo;s her life been? What is it now, I wonder? Beastly to
      rake up things at this time of day.&rsquo; Again the figure of his cousin
      standing with a hand on a front door of a fine olive-green leaped out,
      vivid, like one of those figures from old-fashioned clocks when the hour
      strikes; and his words sounded in Jolyon&rsquo;s ears clearer than any
      chime: &ldquo;I manage my own affairs. I&rsquo;ve told you once, I tell
      you again: We are not at home.&rdquo; The repugnance he had then felt for
      Soames&mdash;for his flat-cheeked, shaven face full of spiritual
      bull-doggedness; for his spare, square, sleek figure slightly crouched as
      it were over the bone he could not digest&mdash;came now again, fresh as
      ever, nay, with an odd increase. &lsquo;I dislike him,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;I dislike him to the very roots of me. And that&rsquo;s lucky; it&rsquo;ll
      make it easier for me to back his wife.&rsquo; Half-artist, and
      half-Forsyte, Jolyon was constitutionally averse from what he termed
      &lsquo;ructions&rsquo;. unless angered, he conformed deeply to that
      classic description of the she-dog, &lsquo;Er&rsquo;d ruther run than
      fight.&rsquo; A little smile became settled in his beard. Ironical that
      Soames should come down here&mdash;to this house, built for himself! How
      he had gazed and gaped at this ruin of his past intention; furtively
      nosing at the walls and stairway, appraising everything! And intuitively
      Jolyon thought: &lsquo;I believe the fellow even now would like to be
      living here. He could never leave off longing for what he once owned!
      Well, I must act, somehow or other; but it&rsquo;s a bore&mdash;a great
      bore.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that evening he wrote to the Chelsea flat, asking if Irene would see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old century which had seen the plant of individualism flower so
      wonderfully was setting in a sky orange with coming storms. Rumours of war
      added to the briskness of a London turbulent at the close of the summer
      holidays. And the streets to Jolyon, who was not often up in town, had a
      feverish look, due to these new motorcars and cabs, of which he
      disapproved aesthetically. He counted these vehicles from his hansom, and
      made the proportion of them one in twenty. &lsquo;They were one in thirty
      about a year ago,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve come to stay.
      Just so much more rattling round of wheels and general stink&rsquo;&mdash;for
      he was one of those rather rare Liberals who object to anything new when
      it takes a material form; and he instructed his driver to get down to the
      river quickly, out of the traffic, desiring to look at the water through
      the mellowing screen of plane-trees. At the little block of flats which
      stood back some fifty yards from the Embankment, he told the cabman to
      wait, and went up to the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mrs. Heron was at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of a settled if very modest income was at once apparent to him
      remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny flat eight years ago
      when he announced her good fortune. Everything was now fresh, dainty, and
      smelled of flowers. The general effect was silvery with touches of black,
      hydrangea colour, and gold. &lsquo;A woman of great taste,&rsquo; he
      thought. Time had dealt gently with Jolyon, for he was a Forsyte. But with
      Irene Time hardly seemed to deal at all, or such was his impression. She
      appeared to him not a day older, standing there in mole-coloured velvet
      corduroy, with soft dark eyes and dark gold hair, with outstretched hand
      and a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had probably never occupied a chair with a fuller sense of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look absolutely unchanged,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you look younger, Cousin Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon ran his hands through his hair, whose thickness was still a comfort
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ancient, but I don&rsquo;t feel it. That&rsquo;s one
      thing about painting, it keeps you young. Titian lived to ninety-nine, and
      had to have plague to kill him off. Do you know, the first time I ever saw
      you I thought of a picture by him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see me for the first time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Botanical Gardens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know me, if you&rsquo;d never seen me before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By someone who came up to you.&rdquo; He was looking at her
      hardily, but her face did not change; and she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; many lives ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your recipe for youth, Irene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who don&rsquo;t live are wonderfully preserved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      H&rsquo;m! a bitter little saying! People who don&rsquo;t live! But an
      opening, and he took it. &ldquo;You remember my Cousin Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her smile faintly at that whimsicality, and at once went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to see me the day before yesterday! He wants a divorce. Do
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; The word seemed startled out of her. &ldquo;After twelve
      years? It&rsquo;s rather late. Won&rsquo;t it be difficult?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon looked hard into her face. &ldquo;Unless....&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I have a lover now. But I have never had one since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he feel at the simplicity and candour of those words? Relief,
      surprise, pity! Venus for twelve years without a lover!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose you would give a good
      deal to be free, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What does it matter, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you were to love again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love.&rdquo; In that simple answer she seemed to sum up
      the whole philosophy of one on whom the world had turned its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Is there anything you would like me to say to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s not free. He had his chance
      once. I don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was a Forsyte; we never part with things, you know,
      unless we want something in their place; and not always then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Cousin Jolyon?&mdash;I think you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m a bit of a mongrel&mdash;not quite a pure
      Forsyte. I never take the halfpennies off my cheques, I put them on,&rdquo;
      said Jolyon uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does Soames want in place of me now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; perhaps children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a little, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard. I would help him
      to be free if I could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon gazed into his hat, his embarrassment was increasing fast; so was
      his admiration, his wonder, and his pity. She was so lovely, and so
      lonely; and altogether it was such a coil!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall have to see Soames. If there&rsquo;s
      anything I can do for you I&rsquo;m always at your service. You must think
      of me as a wretched substitute for my father. At all events I&rsquo;ll let
      you know what happens when I speak to Soames. He may supply the material
      himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he has a lot to lose; and I have nothing. I should like
      him to be free; but I don&rsquo;t see what I can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I at the moment,&rdquo; said Jolyon, and soon after took his
      leave. He went down to his hansom. Half-past three! Soames would be at his
      office still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Poultry,&rdquo; he called through the trap. In front of the
      Houses of Parliament and in Whitehall, newsvendors were calling, &ldquo;Grave
      situation in the Transvaal!&rdquo; but the cries hardly roused him,
      absorbed in recollection of that very beautiful figure, of her soft dark
      glance, and the words: &ldquo;I have never had one since.&rdquo; What on
      earth did such a woman do with her life, back-watered like this? Solitary,
      unprotected, with every man&rsquo;s hand against her or rather&mdash;reaching
      out to grasp her at the least sign. And year after year she went on like
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &lsquo;Poultry&rsquo; above the passing citizens brought him back
      to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte,&rsquo; in black letters on a ground
      the colour of peasoup, spurred him to a sort of vigour, and he went up the
      stone stairs muttering: &ldquo;Fusty musty ownerships! Well, we couldn&rsquo;t
      do without them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want Mr. Soames Forsyte,&rdquo; he said to the boy who opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jolyon Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked at him curiously, never having seen a Forsyte with a
      beard, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offices of &lsquo;Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte&rsquo; had slowly
      absorbed the offices of &lsquo;Tooting and Bowles,&rsquo; and occupied the
      whole of the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firm consisted now of nothing but Soames and a number of managing and
      articled clerks. The complete retirement of James some six years ago had
      accelerated business, to which the final touch of speed had been imparted
      when Bustard dropped off, worn out, as many believed, by the suit of
      &lsquo;Fryer versus Forsyte,&rsquo; more in Chancery than ever and less
      likely to benefit its beneficiaries. Soames, with his saner grasp of
      actualities, had never permitted it to worry him; on the contrary, he had
      long perceived that Providence had presented him therein with L200 a year
      net in perpetuity, and&mdash;why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jolyon entered, his cousin was drawing out a list of holdings in
      Consols, which in view of the rumours of war he was going to advise his
      companies to put on the market at once, before other companies did the
      same. He looked round, sidelong, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you? Just one minute. Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And
      having entered three amounts, and set a ruler to keep his place, he turned
      towards Jolyon, biting the side of his flat forefinger....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has remained faithful to memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, Jolyon was ashamed. His cousin had flushed a dusky
      yellowish red. What had made him tease the poor brute!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to tell you she is sorry you are not free. Twelve years is a
      long time. You know your law, and what chance it gives you.&rdquo; Soames
      uttered a curious little grunt, and the two remained a full minute without
      speaking. &lsquo;Like wax!&rsquo; thought Jolyon, watching that close
      face, where the flush was fast subsiding. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never give me
      a sign of what he&rsquo;s thinking, or going to do. Like wax!&rsquo; And
      he transferred his gaze to a plan of that flourishing town, &lsquo;By-Street
      on Sea,&rsquo; the future existence of which lay exposed on the wall to
      the possessive instincts of the firm&rsquo;s clients. The whimsical
      thought flashed through him: &lsquo;I wonder if I shall get a bill of
      costs for this&mdash;&ldquo;To attending Mr. Jolyon Forsyte in the matter
      of my divorce, to receiving his account of his visit to my wife, and to
      advising him to go and see her again, sixteen and eightpence.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Soames said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on like this. I tell you, I
      can&rsquo;t go on like this.&rdquo; His eyes were shifting from side to
      side, like an animal&rsquo;s when it looks for way of escape. &lsquo;He
      really suffers,&rsquo; thought Jolyon; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no business to
      forget that, just because I don&rsquo;t like him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;it lies with yourself. A man
      can always put these things through if he&rsquo;ll take it on himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned square to him, with a sound which seemed to come from
      somewhere very deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I suffer more than I&rsquo;ve suffered already? Why
      should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon could only shrug his shoulders. His reason agreed, his instinct
      rebelled; he could not have said why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; went on Soames, &ldquo;took an interest in her&mdash;why,
      goodness knows! And I suppose you do too?&rdquo; he gave Jolyon a sharp
      look. &ldquo;It seems to me that one only has to do another person a wrong
      to get all the sympathy. I don&rsquo;t know in what way I was to blame&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      never known. I always treated her well. I gave her everything she could
      wish for. I wanted her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Jolyon&rsquo;s reason nodded; again his instinct shook its head.
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;there must be something wrong
      in me. Yet if there is, I&rsquo;d rather be wrong than right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Soames with a sort of glum fierceness,
      &ldquo;she was my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash the thought went through his listener: &lsquo;There it is!
      Ownerships! Well, we all own things. But&mdash;human beings! Pah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to look at facts,&rdquo; he said drily, &ldquo;or rather
      the want of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gave him another quick suspicious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The want of them?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, but I am not so sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Jolyon; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
      you what she said. It was explicit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My experience has not been one to promote blind confidence in her
      word. We shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; returned Soames; and Jolyon went out trying to
      understand the look, half-startled, half-menacing, on his cousin&rsquo;s
      face. He sought Waterloo Station in a disturbed frame of mind, as though
      the skin of his moral being had been scraped; and all the way down in the
      train he thought of Irene in her lonely flat, and of Soames in his lonely
      office, and of the strange paralysis of life that lay on them both.
      &lsquo;In chancery!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Both their necks in chancery&mdash;and
      her&rsquo;s so pretty!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;VAL HEARS THE NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The keeping of engagements had not as yet been a conspicuous feature in
      the life of young Val Dartie, so that when he broke two and kept one, it
      was the latter event which caused him, if anything, the greater surprise,
      while jogging back to town from Robin Hill after his ride with Holly. She
      had been even prettier than he had thought her yesterday, on her
      silver-roan, long-tailed &lsquo;palfrey&rsquo;. and it seemed to him,
      self-critical in the brumous October gloaming and the outskirts of London,
      that only his boots had shone throughout their two-hour companionship. He
      took out his new gold &lsquo;hunter&rsquo;&mdash;present from James&mdash;and
      looked not at the time, but at sections of his face in the glittering back
      of its opened case. He had a temporary spot over one eyebrow, and it
      displeased him, for it must have displeased her. Crum never had any spots.
      Together with Crum rose the scene in the promenade of the Pandemonium.
      To-day he had not had the faintest desire to unbosom himself to Holly
      about his father. His father lacked poetry, the stirrings of which he was
      feeling for the first time in his nineteen years. The Liberty, with
      Cynthia Dark, that almost mythical embodiment of rapture; the Pandemonium,
      with the woman of uncertain age&mdash;both seemed to Val completely
      &lsquo;off,&rsquo; fresh from communion with this new, shy, dark-haired
      young cousin of his. She rode &lsquo;Jolly well,&rsquo; too, so that it
      had been all the more flattering that she had let him lead her where he
      would in the long gallops of Richmond Park, though she knew them so much
      better than he did. Looking back on it all, he was mystified by the
      barrenness of his speech; he felt that he could say &lsquo;an awful lot of
      fetching things&rsquo; if he had but the chance again, and the thought
      that he must go back to Littlehampton on the morrow, and to Oxford on the
      twelfth&mdash;&rsquo;to that beastly exam,&rsquo; too&mdash;without the
      faintest chance of first seeing her again, caused darkness to settle on
      his spirit even more quickly than on the evening. He should write to her,
      however, and she had promised to answer. Perhaps, too, she would come up
      to Oxford to see her brother. That thought was like the first star, which
      came out as he rode into Padwick&rsquo;s livery stables in the purlieus of
      Sloane Square. He got off and stretched himself luxuriously, for he had
      ridden some twenty-five good miles. The Dartie within him made him chaffer
      for five minutes with young Padwick concerning the favourite for the
      Cambridgeshire; then with the words, &ldquo;Put the gee down to my
      account,&rdquo; he walked away, a little wide at the knees, and flipping
      his boots with his knotty little cane. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel a bit
      inclined to go out,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I wonder if mother will
      stand fizz for my last night!&rsquo; With &lsquo;fizz&rsquo; and
      recollection, he could well pass a domestic evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came down, speckless after his bath, he found his mother
      scrupulous in a low evening dress, and, to his annoyance, his Uncle
      Soames. They stopped talking when he came in; then his uncle said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better be told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At those words, which meant something about his father, of course, Val&rsquo;s
      first thought was of Holly. Was it anything beastly? His mother began
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; she said in her fashionably appointed voice,
      while her fingers plucked rather pitifully at sea-green brocade, &ldquo;your
      father, my dear boy, has&mdash;is not at Newmarket; he&rsquo;s on his way
      to South America. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s left us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked from her to Soames. Left them! Was he sorry? Was he fond of his
      father? It seemed to him that he did not know. Then, suddenly&mdash;as at
      a whiff of gardenias and cigars&mdash;his heart twitched within him, and
      he was sorry. One&rsquo;s father belonged to one, could not go off in this
      fashion&mdash;it was not done! Nor had he always been the &lsquo;bounder&rsquo;
      of the Pandemonium promenade. There were precious memories of tailors&rsquo;
      shops and horses, tips at school, and general lavish kindness, when in
      luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he said. Then, as a sportsman himself, was sorry he
      had asked. The mask of his mother&rsquo;s face was all disturbed; and he
      burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mother, don&rsquo;t tell me! Only, what does it mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A divorce, Val, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val uttered a queer little grunt, and looked quickly at his uncle&mdash;that
      uncle whom he had been taught to look on as a guarantee against the
      consequences of having a father, even against the Dartie blood in his own
      veins. The flat-checked visage seemed to wince, and this upset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be public, will it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So vividly before him had come recollection of his own eyes glued to the
      unsavoury details of many a divorce suit in the Public Press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be done quietly somehow? It&rsquo;s so disgusting
      for&mdash;for mother, and&mdash;and everybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything will be done as quietly as it can, you may be sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but, why is it necessary at all? Mother doesn&rsquo;t
      want to marry again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Himself, the girls, their name tarnished in the sight of his schoolfellows
      and of Crum, of the men at Oxford, of&mdash;Holly! Unbearable! What was to
      be gained by it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, Mother?&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus brought face to face with so much of her own feeling by the one she
      loved best in the world, Winifred rose from the Empire chair in which she
      had been sitting. She saw that her son would be against her unless he was
      told everything; and, yet, how could she tell him? Thus, still plucking at
      the green brocade, she stared at Soames. Val, too, stared at Soames.
      Surely this embodiment of respectability and the sense of property could
      not wish to bring such a slur on his own sister!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames slowly passed a little inlaid paperknife over the smooth surface of
      a marqueterie table; then, without looking at his nephew, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what your mother has had to put up with
      these twenty years. This is only the last straw, Val.&rdquo; And glancing
      up sideways at Winifred, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was silent. If he were not told, he would be against her! Yet,
      how dreadful to be told such things of his own father! Clenching her lips,
      she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames spoke in a rapid, even voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has always been a burden round your mother&rsquo;s neck. She has
      paid his debts over and over again; he has often been drunk, abused and
      threatened her; and now he is gone to Buenos Aires with a dancer.&rdquo;
      And, as if distrusting the efficacy of those words on the boy, he went on
      quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took your mother&rsquo;s pearls to give to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val jerked up his hand, then. At that signal of distress Winifred cried
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Soames&mdash;stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the boy, the Dartie and the Forsyte were struggling. For debts, drink,
      dancers, he had a certain sympathy; but the pearls&mdash;no! That was too
      much! And suddenly he found his mother&rsquo;s hand squeezing his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he heard Soames say, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t have it
      all begin over again. There&rsquo;s a limit; we must strike while the iron&rsquo;s
      hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val freed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;you&rsquo;re&mdash;never going to bring out that about
      the pearls! I couldn&rsquo;t stand that&mdash;I simply couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Val&mdash;oh no! That&rsquo;s only to show you how
      impossible your father is!&rdquo; And his uncle nodded. Somewhat assuaged,
      Val took out a cigarette. His father had bought him that thin curved case.
      Oh! it was unbearable&mdash;just as he was going up to Oxford!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t mother be protected without?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      could look after her. It could always be done later if it was really
      necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile played for a moment round Soames&rsquo; lips, and became bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking of; nothing&rsquo;s
      so fatal as delay in such matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, boy, nothing&rsquo;s so fatal. I know from experience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had the ring of exasperation. Val regarded him round-eyed, never
      having known his uncle express any sort of feeling. Oh! Yes&mdash;he
      remembered now&mdash;there had been an Aunt Irene, and something had
      happened&mdash;something which people kept dark; he had heard his father
      once use an unmentionable word of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to speak ill of your father,&rdquo; Soames went
      on doggedly, &ldquo;but I know him well enough to be sure that he&rsquo;ll
      be back on your mother&rsquo;s hands before a year&rsquo;s over. You can
      imagine what that will mean to her and to all of you after this. The only
      thing is to cut the knot for good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, Val was impressed; and, happening to look at his
      mother&rsquo;s face, he got what was perhaps his first real insight into
      the fact that his own feelings were not always what mattered most.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, mother,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll back you up.
      Only I&rsquo;d like to know when it&rsquo;ll be. It&rsquo;s my first term,
      you know. I don&rsquo;t want to be up there when it comes off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear boy,&rdquo; murmured Winifred, &ldquo;it is a bore for
      you.&rdquo; So, by habit, she phrased what, from the expression of her
      face, was the most poignant regret. &ldquo;When will it be, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;not for months. We must get restitution
      first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the deuce is that?&rsquo; thought Val. &lsquo;What silly
      brutes lawyers are! Not for months! I know one thing: I&rsquo;m not going
      to dine in!&rsquo; And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry, mother, I&rsquo;ve got to go out to dinner now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was his last night, Winifred nodded almost gratefully; they both
      felt that they had gone quite far enough in the expression of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val sought the misty freedom of Green Street, reckless and depressed. And
      not till he reached Piccadilly did he discover that he had only
      eighteen-pence. One couldn&rsquo;t dine off eighteen-pence, and he was
      very hungry. He looked longingly at the windows of the Iseeum Club, where
      he had often eaten of the best with his father! Those pearls! There was no
      getting over them! But the more he brooded and the further he walked the
      hungrier he naturally became. Short of trailing home, there were only two
      places where he could go&mdash;his grandfather&rsquo;s in Park Lane, and
      Timothy&rsquo;s in the Bayswater Road. Which was the less deplorable? At
      his grandfather&rsquo;s he would probably get a better dinner on the spur
      of the moment. At Timothy&rsquo;s they gave you a jolly good feed when
      they expected you, not otherwise. He decided on Park Lane, not unmoved by
      the thought that to go up to Oxford without affording his grandfather a
      chance to tip him was hardly fair to either of them. His mother would hear
      he had been there, of course, and might think it funny; but he couldn&rsquo;t
      help that. He rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Warmson, any dinner for me, d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just going in, Master Val. Mr. Forsyte will be very
      glad to see you. He was saying at lunch that he never saw you nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am. Kill the fatted calf, Warmson, let&rsquo;s have
      fizz.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Warmson smiled faintly&mdash;in his opinion Val was a young limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask Mrs. Forsyte, Master Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Val grumbled, taking off his overcoat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not at school any more, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Warmson, not without a sense of humour, opened the door beyond the stag&rsquo;s-horn
      coat stand, with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Valerus, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him!&rdquo; thought Val, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warm embrace, a &ldquo;Well, Val!&rdquo; from Emily, and a rather
      quavery &ldquo;So there you are at last!&rdquo; from James, restored his
      sense of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let us know? There&rsquo;s only saddle of
      mutton. Champagne, Warmson,&rdquo; said Emily. And they went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the great dining-table, shortened to its utmost, under which so many
      fashionable legs had rested, James sat at one end, Emily at the other, Val
      half-way between them; and something of the loneliness of his
      grandparents, now that all their four children were flown, reached the boy&rsquo;s
      spirit. &lsquo;I hope I shall kick the bucket long before I&rsquo;m as old
      as grandfather,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Poor old chap, he&rsquo;s as
      thin as a rail!&rsquo; And lowering his voice while his grandfather and
      Warmson were in discussion about sugar in the soup, he said to Emily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty brutal at home, Granny. I suppose you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Soames was there when I left. I say, isn&rsquo;t there
      anything to be done to prevent a divorce? Why is he so beastly keen on it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my dear!&rdquo; murmured Emily; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re keeping it
      from your grandfather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; voice sounded from the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What are you talking about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Val&rsquo;s college,&rdquo; returned Emily. &ldquo;Young
      Pariser was there, James; you remember&mdash;he nearly broke the Bank at
      Monte Carlo afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James muttered that he did not know&mdash;Val must look after himself up
      there, or he&rsquo;d get into bad ways. And he looked at his grandson with
      gloom, out of which affection distrustfully glimmered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; said Val to his plate, &ldquo;is
      of being hard up, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By instinct he knew that the weak spot in that old man was fear of
      insecurity for his grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said James, and the soup in his spoon dribbled over,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have a good allowance; but you must keep within it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; murmured Val; &ldquo;if it is good. How much will
      it be, Grandfather?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred and fifty; it&rsquo;s too much. I had next to nothing
      at your age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val sighed. He had hoped for four, and been afraid of three. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know what your young cousin has,&rdquo; said James; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s up
      there. His father&rsquo;s a rich man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Val hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; replied James, flustered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got so many
      expenses. Your father....&rdquo; and he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Jolyon&rsquo;s got an awfully jolly place. I went down there
      with Uncle Soames&mdash;ripping stables.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured James profoundly. &ldquo;That house&mdash;I
      knew how it would be!&rdquo; And he lapsed into gloomy meditation over his
      fish-bones. His son&rsquo;s tragedy, and the deep cleavage it had caused
      in the Forsyte family, had still the power to draw him down into a
      whirlpool of doubts and misgivings. Val, who hankered to talk of Robin
      Hill, because Robin Hill meant Holly, turned to Emily and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that the house built for Uncle Soames?&rdquo; And, receiving
      her nod, went on: &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me about him, Granny.
      What became of Aunt Irene? Is she still going? He seems awfully worked-up
      about something to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily laid her finger on her lips, but the word Irene had caught James&rsquo;
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said, staying a piece of mutton close
      to his lips. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been seeing her? I knew we hadn&rsquo;t
      heard the last of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, James,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;eat your dinner. Nobody&rsquo;s
      been seeing anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James put down his fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I might die before you&rsquo;d
      tell me of it. Is Soames getting a divorce?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Emily with incomparable aplomb; &ldquo;Soames
      is much too sensible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James had sought his own throat, gathering the long white whiskers
      together on the skin and bone of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she was always....&rdquo; he said, and with that
      enigmatic remark the conversation lapsed, for Warmson had returned. But
      later, when the saddle of mutton had been succeeded by sweet, savoury, and
      dessert, and Val had received a cheque for twenty pounds and his
      grandfather&rsquo;s kiss&mdash;like no other kiss in the world, from lips
      pushed out with a sort of fearful suddenness, as if yielding to weakness&mdash;he
      returned to the charge in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about Uncle Soames, Granny. Why is he so keen on mother&rsquo;s
      getting a divorce?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Uncle Soames,&rdquo; said Emily, and her voice had in it an
      exaggerated assurance, &ldquo;is a lawyer, my dear boy. He&rsquo;s sure to
      know best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; muttered Val. &ldquo;But what did become of Aunt
      Irene? I remember she was jolly good-looking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;er....&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;behaved very badly. We
      don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want everybody at Oxford to know about our
      affairs,&rdquo; ejaculated Val; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a brutal idea. Why
      couldn&rsquo;t father be prevented without its being made public?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily sighed. She had always lived rather in an atmosphere of divorce,
      owing to her fashionable proclivities&mdash;so many of those whose legs
      had been under her table having gained a certain notoriety. When, however,
      it touched her own family, she liked it no better than other people. But
      she was eminently practical, and a woman of courage, who never pursued a
      shadow in preference to its substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will be happier if she&rsquo;s
      quite free, Val. Good-night, my dear boy; and don&rsquo;t wear loud
      waistcoats up at Oxford, they&rsquo;re not the thing just now. Here&rsquo;s
      a little present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With another five pounds in his hand, and a little warmth in his heart,
      for he was fond of his grandmother, he went out into Park Lane. A wind had
      cleared the mist, the autumn leaves were rustling, and the stars were
      shining. With all that money in his pocket an impulse to &lsquo;see life&rsquo;
      beset him; but he had not gone forty yards in the direction of Piccadilly
      when Holly&rsquo;s shy face, and her eyes with an imp dancing in their
      gravity, came up before him, and his hand seemed to be tingling again from
      the pressure of her warm gloved hand. &lsquo;No, dash it!&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going home!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;SOAMES ENTERTAINS THE FUTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was full late for the river, but the weather was lovely, and summer
      lingered below the yellowing leaves. Soames took many looks at the day
      from his riverside garden near Mapledurham that Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his own hands he put flowers about his little house-boat, and
      equipped the punt, in which, after lunch, he proposed to take them on the
      river. Placing those Chinese-looking cushions, he could not tell whether
      or no he wished to take Annette alone. She was so very pretty&mdash;could
      he trust himself not to say irrevocable words, passing beyond the limits
      of discretion? Roses on the veranda were still in bloom, and the hedges
      ever-green, so that there was almost nothing of middle-aged autumn to
      chill the mood; yet was he nervous, fidgety, strangely distrustful of his
      powers to steer just the right course. This visit had been planned to
      produce in Annette and her mother a due sense of his possessions, so that
      they should be ready to receive with respect any overture he might later
      be disposed to make. He dressed with great care, making himself neither
      too young nor too old, very thankful that his hair was still thick and
      smooth and had no grey in it. Three times he went up to his
      picture-gallery. If they had any knowledge at all, they must see at once
      that his collection alone was worth at least thirty thousand pounds. He
      minutely inspected, too, the pretty bedroom overlooking the river where
      they would take off their hats. It would be her bedroom if&mdash;if the
      matter went through, and she became his wife. Going up to the
      dressing-table he passed his hand over the lilac-coloured pincushion, into
      which were stuck all kinds of pins; a bowl of pot-pourri exhaled a scent
      that made his head turn just a little. His wife! If only the whole thing
      could be settled out of hand, and there was not the nightmare of this
      divorce to be gone through first; and with gloom puckered on his forehead,
      he looked out at the river shining beyond the roses and the lawn. Madame
      Lamotte would never resist this prospect for her child; Annette would
      never resist her mother. If only he were free! He drove to the station to
      meet them. What taste Frenchwomen had! Madame Lamotte was in black with
      touches of lilac colour, Annette in greyish lilac linen, with cream
      coloured gloves and hat. Rather pale she looked and Londony; and her blue
      eyes were demure. Waiting for them to come down to lunch, Soames stood in
      the open french-window of the diningroom moved by that sensuous delight in
      sunshine and flowers and trees which only came to the full when youth and
      beauty were there to share it with one. He had ordered the lunch with
      intense consideration; the wine was a very special Sauterne, the whole
      appointments of the meal perfect, the coffee served on the veranda
      super-excellent. Madame Lamotte accepted creme de menthe; Annette refused.
      Her manners were charming, with just a suspicion of &lsquo;the conscious
      beauty&rsquo; creeping into them. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; thought Soames,
      &lsquo;another year of London and that sort of life, and she&rsquo;ll be
      spoiled.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was in sedate French raptures. &ldquo;Adorable! Le soleil est si
      bon! How everything is chic, is it not, Annette? Monsieur is a real Monte
      Cristo.&rdquo; Annette murmured assent, with a look up at Soames which he
      could not read. He proposed a turn on the river. But to punt two persons
      when one of them looked so ravishing on those Chinese cushions was merely
      to suffer from a sense of lost opportunity; so they went but a short way
      towards Pangbourne, drifting slowly back, with every now and then an
      autumn leaf dropping on Annette or on her mother&rsquo;s black amplitude.
      And Soames was not happy, worried by the thought: &lsquo;How&mdash;when&mdash;where&mdash;can
      I say&mdash;what?&rsquo; They did not yet even know that he was married.
      To tell them he was married might jeopardise his every chance; yet, if he
      did not definitely make them understand that he wished for Annette&rsquo;s
      hand, it would be dropping into some other clutch before he was free to
      claim it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At tea, which they both took with lemon, Soames spoke of the Transvaal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be war,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamotte lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ces pauvres gens bergers!&rdquo; Could they not be left to
      themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled&mdash;the question seemed to him absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely as a woman of business she understood that the British could not
      abandon their legitimate commercial interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that!&rdquo; But Madame Lamotte found that the English were a
      little hypocrite. They were talking of justice and the Uitlanders, not of
      business. Monsieur was the first who had spoken to her of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Boers are only half-civilised,&rdquo; remarked Soames; &ldquo;they
      stand in the way of progress. It will never do to let our suzerainty go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean to say? Suzerainty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange word!&rdquo; Soames became eloquent, roused by these
      threats to the principle of possession, and stimulated by Annette&rsquo;s
      eyes fixed on him. He was delighted when presently she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Monsieur is right. They should be taught a lesson.&rdquo;
      She was sensible!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must act with moderation. I&rsquo;m
      no jingo. We must be firm without bullying. Will you come up and see my
      pictures?&rdquo; Moving from one to another of these treasures, he soon
      perceived that they knew nothing. They passed his last Mauve, that
      remarkable study of a &lsquo;Hay-cart going Home,&rsquo; as if it were a
      lithograph. He waited almost with awe to see how they would view the jewel
      of his collection&mdash;an Israels whose price he had watched ascending
      till he was now almost certain it had reached top value, and would be
      better on the market again. They did not view it at all. This was a shock;
      and yet to have in Annette a virgin taste to form would be better than to
      have the silly, half-baked predilections of the English middle-class to
      deal with. At the end of the gallery was a Meissonier of which he was
      rather ashamed&mdash;Meissonier was so steadily going down. Madame Lamotte
      stopped before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meissonier! Ah! What a jewel!&rdquo; Soames took advantage of that
      moment. Very gently touching Annette&rsquo;s arm, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like my place, Annette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not shrink, did not respond; she looked at him full, looked down,
      and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would not like it? It is so beautiful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps some day&mdash;&rdquo; Soames said, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      So pretty she was, so self-possessed&mdash;she frightened him. Those
      cornflower-blue eyes, the turn of that creamy neck, her delicate curves&mdash;she
      was a standing temptation to indiscretion! No! No! One must be sure of one&rsquo;s
      ground&mdash;much surer! &lsquo;If I hold off,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;it
      will tantalise her.&rsquo; And he crossed over to Madame Lamotte, who was
      still in front of the Meissonier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s quite a good example of his later work. You must
      come again, Madame, and see them lighted up. You must both come and spend
      a night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enchanted, would it not be beautiful to see them lighted? By moonlight
      too, the river must be ravishing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art sentimental, Maman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentimental! That black-robed, comely, substantial Frenchwoman of the
      world! And suddenly he was certain as he could be that there was no
      sentiment in either of them. All the better. Of what use sentiment? And
      yet...!
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove to the station with them, and saw them into the train. To the
      tightened pressure of his hand it seemed that Annette&rsquo;s fingers
      responded just a little; her face smiled at him through the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the carriage, brooding. &ldquo;Go on home, Jordan,&rdquo;
      he said to the coachman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk.&rdquo; And he strode out
      into the darkening lanes, caution and the desire of possession playing
      see-saw within him. &lsquo;Bon soir, monsieur!&rsquo; How softly she had
      said it. To know what was in her mind! The French&mdash;they were like
      cats&mdash;one could tell nothing! But&mdash;how pretty! What a perfect
      young thing to hold in one&rsquo;s arms! What a mother for his heir! And
      he thought, with a smile, of his family and their surprise at a French
      wife, and their curiosity, and of the way he would play with it and buffet
      it confound them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The poplars sighed in the darkness; an owl hooted. Shadows deepened in the
      water. &lsquo;I will and must be free,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t
      hang about any longer. I&rsquo;ll go and see Irene. If you want things
      done, do them yourself. I must live again&mdash;live and move and have my
      being.&rsquo; And in echo to that queer biblicality church-bells chimed
      the call to evening prayer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;AND VISITS THE PAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a Tuesday evening after dining at his club Soames set out to do what
      required more courage and perhaps less delicacy than anything he had yet
      undertaken in his life&mdash;save perhaps his birth, and one other action.
      He chose the evening, indeed, partly because Irene was more likely to be
      in, but mainly because he had failed to find sufficient resolution by
      daylight, had needed wine to give him extra daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his hansom on the Embankment, and walked up to the Old Church,
      uncertain of the block of flats where he knew she lived. He found it
      hiding behind a much larger mansion; and having read the name, &lsquo;Mrs.
      Irene Heron&rsquo;&mdash;Heron, forsooth! Her maiden name: so she used
      that again, did she?&mdash;he stepped back into the road to look up at the
      windows of the first floor. Light was coming through in the corner flat,
      and he could hear a piano being played. He had never had a love of music,
      had secretly borne it a grudge in the old days when so often she had
      turned to her piano, making of it a refuge place into which she knew he
      could not enter. Repulse! The long repulse, at first restrained and
      secret, at last open! Bitter memory came with that sound. It must be she
      playing, and thus almost assured of seeing her, he stood more undecided
      than ever. Shivers of anticipation ran through him; his tongue felt dry,
      his heart beat fast. &lsquo;I have no cause to be afraid,&rsquo; he
      thought. And then the lawyer stirred within him. Was he doing a foolish
      thing? Ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the presence of
      her trustee? No! Not before that fellow Jolyon, who sympathised with her!
      Never! He crossed back into the doorway, and, slowly, to keep down the
      beating of his heart, mounted the single flight of stairs and rang the
      bell. When the door was opened to him his sensations were regulated by the
      scent which came&mdash;that perfume&mdash;from away back in the past,
      bringing muffled remembrance: fragrance of a drawing-room he used to
      enter, of a house he used to own&mdash;perfume of dried rose-leaves and
      honey!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Mr. Forsyte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your mistress will see me,
      I know.&rdquo; He had thought this out; she would think it was Jolyon!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the maid was gone and he was alone in the tiny hall, where the light
      was dim from one pearly-shaded sconce, and walls, carpet, everything was
      silvery, making the walled-in space all ghostly, he could only think
      ridiculously: &lsquo;Shall I go in with my overcoat on, or take it off?&rsquo;
      The music ceased; the maid said from the doorway:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you walk in, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames walked in. He noted mechanically that all was still silvery, and
      that the upright piano was of satinwood. She had risen and stood recoiled
      against it; her hand, placed on the keys as if groping for support, had
      struck a sudden discord, held for a moment, and released. The light from
      the shaded piano-candle fell on her neck, leaving her face rather in
      shadow. She was in a black evening dress, with a sort of mantilla over her
      shoulders&mdash;he did not remember ever having seen her in black, and the
      thought passed through him: &lsquo;She dresses even when she&rsquo;s
      alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he heard her whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times Soames had rehearsed this scene in fancy. Rehearsal served him
      not at all. He simply could not speak. He had never thought that the sight
      of this woman whom he had once so passionately desired, so completely
      owned, and whom he had not seen for twelve years, could affect him in this
      way. He had imagined himself speaking and acting, half as man of business,
      half as judge. And now it was as if he were in the presence not of a mere
      woman and erring wife, but of some force, subtle and elusive as atmosphere
      itself within him and outside. A kind of defensive irony welled up in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a queer visit! I hope you&rsquo;re well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Will you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had moved away from the piano, and gone over to a window-seat, sinking
      on to it, with her hands clasped in her lap. Light fell on her there, so
      that Soames could see her face, eyes, hair, strangely as he remembered
      them, strangely beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the edge of a satinwood chair, upholstered with
      silver-coloured stuff, close to where he was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not changed,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? What have you come for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To discuss things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard what you want from your cousin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing. I have always been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of her voice, reserved and close, the sight of her figure
      watchfully poised, defensive, was helping him now. A thousand memories of
      her, ever on the watch against him, stirred, and....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will be good enough, then, to give me information on
      which I can act. The law must be complied with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none to give you that you don&rsquo;t know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years! Do you suppose I can believe that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you will believe anything I say; but it&rsquo;s
      the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked at her hard. He had said that she had not changed; now he
      perceived that she had. Not in face, except that it was more beautiful;
      not in form, except that it was a little fuller&mdash;no! She had changed
      spiritually. There was more of her, as it were, something of activity and
      daring, where there had been sheer passive resistance. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
      he thought, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s her independent income! Confound Uncle
      Jolyon!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re comfortably off now?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let me provide for you? I would have, in spite
      of everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile came on her lips; but she did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still my wife,&rdquo; said Soames. Why he said that, what
      he meant by it, he knew neither when he spoke nor after. It was a truism
      almost preposterous, but its effect was startling. She rose from the
      window-seat, and stood for a moment perfectly still, looking at him. He
      could see her bosom heaving. Then she turned to the window and threw it
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do that?&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch cold
      in that dress. I&rsquo;m not dangerous.&rdquo; And he uttered a little sad
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She echoed it&mdash;faintly, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;habit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather odd habit,&rdquo; said Soames as bitterly. &ldquo;Shut the
      window!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut it and sat down again. She had developed power, this woman&mdash;this&mdash;wife
      of his! He felt it issuing from her as she sat there, in a sort of armour.
      And almost unconsciously he rose and moved nearer; he wanted to see the
      expression on her face. Her eyes met his unflinching. Heavens! how clear
      they were, and what a dark brown against that white skin, and that
      burnt-amber hair! And how white her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funny sensation this! He ought to hate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better tell me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s to your
      advantage to be free as well as to mine. That old matter is too old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me there has been nothing&mdash;nobody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. You must go to your own life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stung by that retort, Soames moved towards the piano and back to the
      hearth, to and fro, as he had been wont in the old days in their
      drawing-room when his feelings were too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You deserted me. In
      common justice it&rsquo;s for you....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her shrug those white shoulders, heard her murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why didn&rsquo;t you divorce me then? Should I have cared?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked at her intently with a sort of curiosity. What on
      earth did she do with herself, if she really lived quite alone? And why
      had he not divorced her? The old feeling that she had never understood
      him, never done him justice, bit him while he stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you have made me a good wife?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was a crime to marry you. I have paid for it. You will find
      some way perhaps. You needn&rsquo;t mind my name, I have none to lose. Now
      I think you had better go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of defeat&mdash;of being defrauded of his self-justification, and
      of something else beyond power of explanation to himself, beset Soames
      like the breath of a cold fog. Mechanically he reached up, took from the
      mantel-shelf a little china bowl, reversed it, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lowestoft. Where did you get this? I bought its fellow at Jobson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      And, visited by the sudden memory of how, those many years ago, he and she
      had bought china together, he remained staring at the little bowl, as if
      it contained all the past. Her voice roused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it. I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames put it back on the shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you shake hands?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile curved her lips. She held out her hand. It was cold to his
      rather feverish touch. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s made of ice,&rsquo; he thought&mdash;&rsquo;she
      was always made of ice!&rsquo; But even as that thought darted through
      him, his senses were assailed by the perfume of her dress and body, as
      though the warmth within her, which had never been for him, were
      struggling to show its presence. And he turned on his heel. He walked out
      and away, as if someone with a whip were after him, not even looking for a
      cab, glad of the empty Embankment and the cold river, and the thick-strewn
      shadows of the plane-tree leaves&mdash;confused, flurried, sore at heart,
      and vaguely disturbed, as though he had made some deep mistake whose
      consequences he could not foresee. And the fantastic thought suddenly
      assailed him if instead of, &lsquo;I think you had better go,&rsquo; she
      had said, &lsquo;I think you had better stay!&rsquo; What should he have
      felt, what would he have done? That cursed attraction of her was there for
      him even now, after all these years of estrangement and bitter thoughts.
      It was there, ready to mount to his head at a sign, a touch. &lsquo;I was
      a fool to go!&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve advanced nothing. Who
      could imagine? I never thought!&rsquo; Memory, flown back to the first
      years of his marriage, played him torturing tricks. She had not deserved
      to keep her beauty&mdash;the beauty he had owned and known so well. And a
      kind of bitterness at the tenacity of his own admiration welled up in him.
      Most men would have hated the sight of her, as she had deserved. She had
      spoiled his life, wounded his pride to death, defrauded him of a son. And
      yet the mere sight of her, cold and resisting as ever, had this power to
      upset him utterly! It was some damned magnetism she had! And no wonder if,
      as she asserted; she had lived untouched these last twelve years. So
      Bosinney&mdash;cursed be his memory!&mdash;had lived on all this time with
      her! Soames could not tell whether he was glad of that knowledge or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing his Club at last he stopped to buy a paper. A headline ran:
      &lsquo;Boers reported to repudiate suzerainty!&rsquo; Suzerainty! &lsquo;Just
      like her!&rsquo; he thought: &lsquo;she always did. Suzerainty! I still
      have it by rights. She must be awfully lonely in that wretched little
      flat!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;ON FORSYTE &lsquo;CHANGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames belonged to two clubs, &lsquo;The Connoisseurs,&rsquo; which he put
      on his cards and seldom visited, and &lsquo;The Remove,&rsquo; which he
      did not put on his cards and frequented. He had joined this Liberal
      institution five years ago, having made sure that its members were now
      nearly all sound Conservatives in heart and pocket, if not in principle.
      Uncle Nicholas had put him up. The fine reading-room was decorated in the
      Adam style.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering that evening he glanced at the tape for any news about the
      Transvaal, and noted that Consols were down seven-sixteenths since the
      morning. He was turning away to seek the reading-room when a voice behind
      him said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Soames, that went off all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Uncle Nicholas, in a frock-coat and his special cut-away collar,
      with a black tie passed through a ring. Heavens! How young and dapper he
      looked at eighty-two!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Roger&rsquo;d have been pleased,&rdquo; his uncle went on.
      &ldquo;The thing was very well done. Blackley&rsquo;s? I&rsquo;ll make a
      note of them. Buxton&rsquo;s done me no good. These Boers are upsetting me&mdash;that
      fellow Chamberlain&rsquo;s driving the country into war. What do you
      think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bound to come,&rdquo; murmured Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas passed his hand over his thin, clean-shaven cheeks, very rosy
      after his summer cure; a slight pout had gathered on his lips. This
      business had revived all his Liberal principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mistrust that chap; he&rsquo;s a stormy petrel. House-property
      will go down if there&rsquo;s war. You&rsquo;ll have trouble with Roger&rsquo;s
      estate. I often told him he ought to get out of some of his houses. He was
      an opinionated beggar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a pair of you!&rsquo; thought Soames. But he never argued
      with an uncle, in that way preserving their opinion of him as &lsquo;a
      long-headed chap,&rsquo; and the legal care of their property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me at Timothy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Nicholas, lowering his
      voice, &ldquo;that Dartie has gone off at last. That&rsquo;ll be a relief
      to your father. He was a rotten egg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Soames nodded. If there was a subject on which the Forsytes really
      agreed, it was the character of Montague Dartie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take care,&rdquo; said Nicholas, &ldquo;or he&rsquo;ll turn up
      again. Winifred had better have the tooth out, I should say. No use
      preserving what&rsquo;s gone bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked at him sideways. His nerves, exacerbated by the interview he
      had just come through, disposed him to see a personal allusion in those
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m advising her,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nicholas, &ldquo;the brougham&rsquo;s waiting; I
      must get home. I&rsquo;m very poorly. Remember me to your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And having thus reconsecrated the ties of blood, he passed down the steps
      at his youthful gait and was wrapped into his fur coat by the junior
      porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known Uncle Nicholas other than &ldquo;very
      poorly,&rdquo; mused Soames, &ldquo;or seen him look other than
      everlasting. What a family! Judging by him, I&rsquo;ve got thirty-eight
      years of health before me. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to waste them.&rsquo;
      And going over to a mirror he stood looking at his face. Except for a line
      or two, and three or four grey hairs in his little dark moustache, had he
      aged any more than Irene? The prime of life&mdash;he and she in the very
      prime of life! And a fantastic thought shot into his mind. Absurd!
      Idiotic! But again it came. And genuinely alarmed by the recurrence, as
      one is by the second fit of shivering which presages a feverish cold, he
      sat down on the weighing machine. Eleven stone! He had not varied two
      pounds in twenty years. What age was she? Nearly thirty-seven&mdash;not
      too old to have a child&mdash;not at all! Thirty-seven on the ninth of
      next month. He remembered her birthday well&mdash;he had always observed
      it religiously, even that last birthday so soon before she left him, when
      he was almost certain she was faithless. Four birthdays in his house. He
      had looked forward to them, because his gifts had meant a semblance of
      gratitude, a certain attempt at warmth. Except, indeed, that last birthday&mdash;which
      had tempted him to be too religious! And he shied away in thought. Memory
      heaps dead leaves on corpse-like deeds, from under which they do but
      vaguely offend the sense. And then he thought suddenly: &lsquo;I could
      send her a present for her birthday. After all, we&rsquo;re Christians!
      Couldn&rsquo;t!&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t we join up again!&rsquo; And he
      uttered a deep sigh sitting there. Annette! Ah! but between him and
      Annette was the need for that wretched divorce suit! And how?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can always work these things, if he&rsquo;ll take it on
      himself,&rdquo; Jolyon had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should he take the scandal on himself with his whole career as a
      pillar of the law at stake? It was not fair! It was quixotic! Twelve years&rsquo;
      separation in which he had taken no steps to free himself put out of court
      the possibility of using her conduct with Bosinney as a ground for
      divorcing her. By doing nothing to secure relief he had acquiesced, even
      if the evidence could now be gathered, which was more than doubtful.
      Besides, his own pride would never let him use that old incident, he had
      suffered from it too much. No! Nothing but fresh misconduct on her part&mdash;but
      she had denied it; and&mdash;almost&mdash;he had believed her. Hung up!
      Utterly hung up!
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the scooped-out red velvet seat with a feeling of
      constriction about his vitals. He would never sleep with this going on in
      him! And, taking coat and hat again, he went out, moving eastward. In
      Trafalgar Square he became aware of some special commotion travelling
      towards him out of the mouth of the Strand. It materialised in newspaper
      men calling out so loudly that no words whatever could be heard. He
      stopped to listen, and one came by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Payper! Special! Ultimatium by Krooger! Declaration of war!&rdquo;
      Soames bought the paper. There it was in the stop press...! His first
      thought was: &lsquo;The Boers are committing suicide.&rsquo; His second:
      &lsquo;Is there anything still I ought to sell?&rsquo; If so he had missed
      the chance&mdash;there would certainly be a slump in the city to-morrow.
      He swallowed this thought with a nod of defiance. That ultimatum was
      insolent&mdash;sooner than let it pass he was prepared to lose money. They
      wanted a lesson, and they would get it; but it would take three months at
      least to bring them to heel. There weren&rsquo;t the troops out there;
      always behind time, the Government! Confound those newspaper rats! What
      was the use of waking everybody up? Breakfast to-morrow was quite soon
      enough. And he thought with alarm of his father. They would cry it down
      Park Lane. Hailing a hansom, he got in and told the man to drive there.
    </p>
    <p>
      James and Emily had just gone up to bed, and after communicating the news
      to Warmson, Soames prepared to follow. He paused by after-thought to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, Warmson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler ceased passing a hat brush over the silk hat Soames had taken
      off, and, inclining his face a little forward, said in a low voice:
      &ldquo;Well, sir, they &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t a chance, of course; but I&rsquo;m
      told they&rsquo;re very good shots. I&rsquo;ve got a son in the
      Inniskillings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Warmson? Why, I didn&rsquo;t know you were married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I don&rsquo;t talk of it. I expect he&rsquo;ll be going
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The slighter shock Soames had felt on discovering that he knew so little
      of one whom he thought he knew so well was lost in the slight shock of
      discovering that the war might touch one personally. Born in the year of
      the Crimean War, he had only come to consciousness by the time the Indian
      Mutiny was over; since then the many little wars of the British Empire had
      been entirely professional, quite unconnected with the Forsytes and all
      they stood for in the body politic. This war would surely be no exception.
      But his mind ran hastily over his family. Two of the Haymans, he had
      heard, were in some Yeomanry or other&mdash;it had always been a pleasant
      thought, there was a certain distinction about the Yeomanry; they wore, or
      used to wear, a blue uniform with silver about it, and rode horses. And
      Archibald, he remembered, had once on a time joined the Militia, but had
      given it up because his father, Nicholas, had made such a fuss about his
      &lsquo;wasting his time peacocking about in a uniform.&rsquo; Recently he
      had heard somewhere that young Nicholas&rsquo; eldest, very young
      Nicholas, had become a Volunteer. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; thought Soames,
      mounting the stairs slowly, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing in that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the landing outside his parents&rsquo; bed and dressing rooms,
      debating whether or not to put his nose in and say a reassuring word.
      Opening the landing window, he listened. The rumble from Piccadilly was
      all the sound he heard, and with the thought, &lsquo;If these motor-cars
      increase, it&rsquo;ll affect house property,&rsquo; he was about to pass
      on up to the room always kept ready for him when he heard, distant as yet,
      the hoarse rushing call of a newsvendor. There it was, and coming past the
      house! He knocked on his mother&rsquo;s door and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was sitting up in bed, with his ears pricked under the white
      hair which Emily kept so beautifully cut. He looked pink, and
      extraordinarily clean, in his setting of white sheet and pillow, out of
      which the points of his high, thin, nightgowned shoulders emerged in small
      peaks. His eyes alone, grey and distrustful under their withered lids,
      were moving from the window to Emily, who in a wrapper was walking up and
      down, squeezing a rubber ball attached to a scent bottle. The room reeked
      faintly of the eau-de-Cologne she was spraying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a fire. The
      Boers have declared war&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stopped her spraying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all she said, and looked at James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, too, looked at his father. He was taking it differently from their
      expectation, as if some thought, strange to them, were working in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he muttered suddenly, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t live
      to see the end of this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, James! It&rsquo;ll be over by Christmas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; James answered her with asperity.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty mess at this time of night, too!&rdquo; He
      lapsed into silence, and his wife and son, as if hypnotised, waited for
      him to say: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know; I knew how
      it would be!&rsquo; But he did not. The grey eyes shifted, evidently
      seeing nothing in the room; then movement occurred under the bedclothes,
      and the knees were drawn up suddenly to a great height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to send out Roberts. It all comes from that fellow
      Gladstone and his Majuba.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two listeners noted something beyond the usual in his voice, something
      of real anxiety. It was as if he had said: &lsquo;I shall never see the
      old country peaceful and safe again. I shall have to die before I know she&rsquo;s
      won.&rsquo; And in spite of the feeling that James must not be encouraged
      to be fussy, they were touched. Soames went up to the bedside and stroked
      his father&rsquo;s hand which had emerged from under the bedclothes, long
      and wrinkled with veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words!&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;consols will go to par.
      For all I know, Val may go and enlist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, James!&rdquo; cried Emily, &ldquo;you talk as if there
      were danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her comfortable voice seemed to soothe James for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I told you how it would be. I don&rsquo;t
      know, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;nobody tells me anything. Are you sleeping
      here, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis was past, he would now compose himself to his normal degree of
      anxiety; and, assuring his father that he was sleeping in the house,
      Soames pressed his hand, and went up to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following afternoon witnessed the greatest crowd Timothy&rsquo;s had
      known for many a year. On national occasions, such as this, it was,
      indeed, almost impossible to avoid going there. Not that there was any
      danger or rather only just enough to make it necessary to assure each
      other that there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas was there early. He had seen Soames the night before&mdash;Soames
      had said it was bound to come. This old Kruger was in his dotage&mdash;why,
      he must be seventy-five if he was a day!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Nicholas was eighty-two.) What had Timothy said? He had had a fit after
      Majuba. These Boers were a grasping lot! The dark-haired Francie, who had
      arrived on his heels, with the contradictious touch which became the free
      spirit of a daughter of Roger, chimed in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kettle and pot, Uncle Nicholas. What price the Uitlanders?&rdquo;
      What price, indeed! A new expression, and believed to be due to her
      brother George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley thought Francie ought not to say such a thing. Dear Mrs.
      MacAnder&rsquo;s boy, Charlie MacAnder, was one, and no one could call him
      grasping. At this Francie uttered one of her mots, scandalising, and so
      frequently repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, his father&rsquo;s a Scotchman, and his mother&rsquo;s a cat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley covered her ears, too late, but Aunt Hester smiled; as for
      Nicholas, he pouted&mdash;witticism of which he was not the author was
      hardly to his taste. Just then Marian Tweetyman arrived, followed almost
      immediately by young Nicholas. On seeing his son, Nicholas rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must be going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Nick here will tell
      you what&rsquo;ll win the race.&rdquo; And with this hit at his eldest,
      who, as a pillar of accountancy, and director of an insurance company, was
      no more addicted to sport than his father had ever been, he departed. Dear
      Nicholas! What race was that? Or was it only one of his jokes? He was a
      wonderful man for his age! How many lumps would dear Marian take? And how
      were Giles and Jesse? Aunt Juley supposed their Yeomanry would be very
      busy now, guarding the coast, though of course the Boers had no ships. But
      one never knew what the French might do if they had the chance, especially
      since that dreadful Fashoda scare, which had upset Timothy so terribly
      that he had made no investments for months afterwards. It was the
      ingratitude of the Boers that was so dreadful, after everything had been
      done for them&mdash;Dr. Jameson imprisoned, and he was so nice, Mrs.
      MacAnder had always said. And Sir Alfred Milner sent out to talk to them&mdash;such
      a clever man! She didn&rsquo;t know what they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment occurred one of those sensations&mdash;so precious at
      Timothy&rsquo;s&mdash;which great occasions sometimes bring forth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss June Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunts Juley and Hester were on their feet at once, trembling from
      smothered resentment, and old affection bubbling up, and pride at the
      return of a prodigal June! Well, this was a surprise! Dear June&mdash;after
      all these years! And how well she was looking! Not changed at all! It was
      almost on their lips to add, &lsquo;And how is your dear grandfather?&rsquo;
      forgetting in that giddy moment that poor dear Jolyon had been in his
      grave for seven years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever the most courageous and downright of all the Forsytes, June, with her
      decided chin and her spirited eyes and her hair like flame, sat down,
      slight and short, on a gilt chair with a bead-worked seat, for all the
      world as if ten years had not elapsed since she had been to see them&mdash;ten
      years of travel and independence and devotion to lame ducks. Those ducks
      of late had been all definitely painters, etchers, or sculptors, so that
      her impatience with the Forsytes and their hopelessly inartistic outlook
      had become intense. Indeed, she had almost ceased to believe that her
      family existed, and looked round her now with a sort of challenging
      directness which brought exquisite discomfort to the roomful. She had not
      expected to meet any of them but &lsquo;the poor old things&rsquo;. and
      why she had come to see them she hardly knew, except that, while on her
      way from Oxford Street to a studio in Latimer Road, she had suddenly
      remembered them with compunction as two long-neglected old lame ducks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley broke the hush again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been saying,
      dear, how dreadful it is about these Boers! And what an impudent thing of
      that old Kruger!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent!&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s quite right.
      What business have we to meddle with them? If he turned out all those
      wretched Uitlanders it would serve them right. They&rsquo;re only after
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of sensation was broken by Francie saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Are you a pro-Boer?&rdquo; (undoubtedly the first use of that
      expression).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Why can&rsquo;t we leave them alone?&rdquo; said June, just
      as, in the open doorway, the maid said &ldquo;Mr. Soames Forsyte.&rdquo;
      Sensation on sensation! Greeting was almost held up by curiosity to see
      how June and he would take this encounter, for it was shrewdly suspected,
      if not quite known, that they had not met since that old and lamentable
      affair of her fiance Bosinney with Soames&rsquo; wife. They were seen to
      just touch each other&rsquo;s hands, and look each at the other&rsquo;s
      left eye only. Aunt Juley came at once to the rescue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear June is so original. Fancy, Soames, she thinks the Boers are
      not to blame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They only want their independence,&rdquo; said June; &ldquo;and why
      shouldn&rsquo;t they have it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Soames, with his smile a little on one
      side, &ldquo;they happen to have agreed to our suzerainty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suzerainty!&rdquo; repeated June scornfully; &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t
      like anyone&rsquo;s suzerainty over us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They got advantages in payment,&rdquo; replied Soames; &ldquo;a
      contract is a contract.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contracts are not always just,&rdquo; fumed out June, &ldquo;and
      when they&rsquo;re not, they ought to be broken. The Boers are much the
      weaker. We could afford to be generous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames sniffed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mere sentiment,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester, to whom nothing was more awful than any kind of disagreement,
      here leaned forward and remarked decisively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lovely weather it has been for the time of year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But June was not to be diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why sentiment should be sneered at. It&rsquo;s
      the best thing in the world.&rdquo; She looked defiantly round, and Aunt
      Juley had to intervene again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you bought any pictures lately, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her incomparable instinct for the wrong subject had not failed her. Soames
      flushed. To disclose the name of his latest purchases would be like
      walking into the jaws of disdain. For somehow they all knew of June&rsquo;s
      predilection for &lsquo;genius&rsquo; not yet on its legs, and her
      contempt for &lsquo;success&rsquo; unless she had had a finger in securing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One or two,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But June&rsquo;s face had changed; the Forsyte within her was seeing its
      chance. Why should not Soames buy some of the pictures of Eric Cobbley&mdash;her
      last lame duck? And she promptly opened her attack: Did Soames know his
      work? It was so wonderful. He was the coming man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, Soames knew his work. It was in his view &lsquo;splashy,&rsquo;
      and would never get hold of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      June blazed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s the last thing one would
      wish for. I thought you were a connoisseur, not a picture-dealer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Soames is a connoisseur,&rdquo; Aunt Juley said hastily;
      &ldquo;he has wonderful taste&mdash;he can always tell beforehand what&rsquo;s
      going to be successful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped June, and sprang up from the bead-covered chair,
      &ldquo;I hate that standard of success. Why can&rsquo;t people buy things
      because they like them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Francie, &ldquo;because you like them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the slight pause young Nicholas was heard saying gently that Violet
      (his fourth) was taking lessons in pastel, he didn&rsquo;t know if they
      were any use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye, Auntie,&rdquo; said June; &ldquo;I must get on,&rdquo;
      and kissing her aunts, she looked defiantly round the room, said &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo;
      again, and went. A breeze seemed to pass out with her, as if everyone had
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third sensation came before anyone had time to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. James Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James came in using a stick slightly and wrapped in a fur coat which gave
      him a fictitious bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone stood up. James was so old; and he had not been at Timothy&rsquo;s
      for nearly two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot in here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames divested him of his coat, and as he did so could not help admiring
      the glossy way his father was turned out. James sat down, all knees,
      elbows, frock-coat, and long white whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of that?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though there was no apparent sense in his words, they all knew that he was
      referring to June. His eyes searched his son&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and see for myself. What have they
      answered Kruger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took out an evening paper, and read the headline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Instant action by our Government&mdash;state of war
      existing!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said James, and sighed. &ldquo;I was afraid they&rsquo;d
      cut and run like old Gladstone. We shall finish with them this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All stared at him. James! Always fussy, nervous, anxious! James with his
      continual, &lsquo;I told you how it would be!&rsquo; and his pessimism,
      and his cautious investments. There was something uncanny about such
      resolution in this the oldest living Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Timothy?&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;He ought to pay
      attention to this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley said she didn&rsquo;t know; Timothy had not said much at lunch
      to-day. Aunt Hester rose and threaded her way out of the room, and Francie
      said rather maliciously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Boers are a hard nut to crack, Uncle James.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; muttered James. &ldquo;Where do you get your
      information? Nobody tells me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Nicholas remarked in his mild voice that Nick (his eldest) was now
      going to drill regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered James, and stared before him&mdash;his thoughts
      were on Val. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to look after his mother,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got no time for drilling and that, with that
      father of his.&rdquo; This cryptic saying produced silence, until he spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did June want here?&rdquo; And his eyes rested with suspicion
      on all of them in turn. &ldquo;Her father&rsquo;s a rich man now.&rdquo;
      The conversation turned on Jolyon, and when he had been seen last. It was
      supposed that he went abroad and saw all sorts of people now that his wife
      was dead; his water-colours were on the line, and he was a successful man.
      Francie went so far as to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him again; he was rather a dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley recalled how he had gone to sleep on the sofa one day, where
      James was sitting. He had always been very amiable; what did Soames think?
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that Jolyon was Irene&rsquo;s trustee, all felt the delicacy of
      this question, and looked at Soames with interest. A faint pink had come
      up in his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going grey,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed! Had Soames seen him? Soames nodded, and the pink vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      James said suddenly: &ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t
      tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It so exactly expressed the sentiment of everybody present that there was
      something behind everything, that nobody responded. But at this moment
      Aunt Hester returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timothy,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;Timothy has bought
      a map, and he&rsquo;s put in&mdash;he&rsquo;s put in three flags.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy had...! A sigh went round the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Timothy had indeed put in three flags already, well!&mdash;it showed
      what the nation could do when it was roused. The war was as good as over.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;JOLYON FINDS OUT WHERE HE IS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolyon stood at the window in Holly&rsquo;s old night nursery, converted
      into a studio, not because it had a north light, but for its view over the
      prospect away to the Grand Stand at Epsom. He shifted to the side window
      which overlooked the stableyard, and whistled down to the dog Balthasar
      who lay for ever under the clock tower. The old dog looked up and wagged
      his tail. &lsquo;Poor old boy!&rsquo; thought Jolyon, shifting back to the
      other window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been restless all this week, since his attempt to prosecute
      trusteeship, uneasy in his conscience which was ever acute, disturbed in
      his sense of compassion which was easily excited, and with a queer
      sensation as if his feeling for beauty had received some definite
      embodiment. Autumn was getting hold of the old oak-tree, its leaves were
      browning. Sunshine had been plentiful and hot this summer. As with trees,
      so with men&rsquo;s lives! &lsquo;I ought to live long,&rsquo; thought
      Jolyon; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m getting mildewed for want of heat. If I can&rsquo;t
      work, I shall be off to Paris.&rsquo; But memory of Paris gave him no
      pleasure. Besides, how could he go? He must stay and see what Soames was
      going to do. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m her trustee. I can&rsquo;t leave her
      unprotected,&rsquo; he thought. It had been striking him as curious how
      very clearly he could still see Irene in her little drawing-room which he
      had only twice entered. Her beauty must have a sort of poignant harmony!
      No literal portrait would ever do her justice; the essence of her was&mdash;ah
      I what?... The noise of hoofs called him back to the other window. Holly
      was riding into the yard on her long-tailed &lsquo;palfrey.&rsquo; She
      looked up and he waved to her. She had been rather silent lately; getting
      old, he supposed, beginning to want her future, as they all did&mdash;youngsters!
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was certainly the devil! And with the feeling that to waste this
      swift-travelling commodity was unforgivable folly, he took up his brush.
      But it was no use; he could not concentrate his eye&mdash;besides, the
      light was going. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to town,&rsquo; he thought. In
      the hall a servant met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady to see you, sir; Mrs. Heron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Extraordinary coincidence! Passing into the picture-gallery, as it was
      still called, he saw Irene standing over by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came towards him saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trespassing; I came up through the coppice and
      garden. I always used to come that way to see Uncle Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t trespass here,&rdquo; replied Jolyon; &ldquo;history
      makes that impossible. I was just thinking of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled. And it was as if something shone through; not mere
      spirituality&mdash;serener, completer, more alluring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;History!&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I once told Uncle Jolyon that
      love was for ever. Well, it isn&rsquo;t. Only aversion lasts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon stared at her. Had she got over Bosinney at last?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;aversion&rsquo;s deeper than love or
      hate because it&rsquo;s a natural product of the nerves, and we don&rsquo;t
      change them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you that Soames has been to see me. He said a thing
      that frightened me. He said: &lsquo;You are still my wife!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Jolyon. &ldquo;You ought not to live alone.&rdquo;
      And he continued to stare at her, afflicted by the thought that where
      Beauty was, nothing ever ran quite straight, which, no doubt, was why so
      many people looked on it as immoral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me to shake hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. When he came in I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t want to; he
      changed while he was there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you certainly ought not to go on living there alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no woman I could ask; and I can&rsquo;t take a lover to
      order, Cousin Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; said Jolyon. &ldquo;What a damnable position!
      Will you stay to dinner? No? Well, let me see you back to town; I wanted
      to go up this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly. I&rsquo;ll be ready in five minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On that walk to the station they talked of pictures and music, contrasting
      the English and French characters and the difference in their attitude to
      Art. But to Jolyon the colours in the hedges of the long straight lane,
      the twittering of chaffinches who kept pace with them, the perfume of
      weeds being already burned, the turn of her neck, the fascination of those
      dark eyes bent on him now and then, the lure of her whole figure, made a
      deeper impression than the remarks they exchanged. Unconsciously he held
      himself straighter, walked with a more elastic step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the train he put her through a sort of catechism as to what she did
      with her days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made her dresses, shopped, visited a hospital, played her piano,
      translated from the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had regular work from a publisher, it seemed, which supplemented her
      income a little. She seldom went out in the evening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been living alone so long, you see, that I don&rsquo;t mind it a bit. I
      believe I&rsquo;m naturally solitary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said Jolyon. &ldquo;Do you know
      many people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very few.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Waterloo they took a hansom, and he drove with her to the door of her
      mansions. Squeezing her hand at parting, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, you could always come to us at Robin Hill; you must let
      me know everything that happens. Good-bye, Irene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon climbed back into his cab, wondering why he had not asked her to
      dine and go to the theatre with him. Solitary, starved, hung-up life that
      she had! &ldquo;Hotch Potch Club,&rdquo; he said through the trap-door. As
      his hansom debouched on to the Embankment, a man in top-hat and overcoat
      passed, walking quickly, so close to the wall that he seemed to be
      scraping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; thought Jolyon; &lsquo;Soames himself! What&rsquo;s
      he up to now?&rsquo; And, stopping the cab round the corner, he got out
      and retraced his steps to where he could see the entrance to the mansions.
      Soames had halted in front of them, and was looking up at the light in her
      windows. &lsquo;If he goes in,&rsquo; thought Jolyon, &lsquo;what shall I
      do? What have I the right to do?&rsquo; What the fellow had said was true.
      She was still his wife, absolutely without protection from annoyance!
      &lsquo;Well, if he goes in,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I follow.&rsquo; And
      he began moving towards the mansions. Again Soames advanced; he was in the
      very entrance now. But suddenly he stopped, spun round on his heel, and
      came back towards the river. &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; thought Jolyon.
      &lsquo;In a dozen steps he&rsquo;ll recognise me.&rsquo; And he turned
      tail. His cousin&rsquo;s footsteps kept pace with his own. But he reached
      his cab, and got in before Soames had turned the corner. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
      he said through the trap. Soames&rsquo; figure ranged up alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hansom!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Engaged? Hallo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; answered Jolyon. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick suspicion on his cousin&rsquo;s face, white in the lamplight,
      decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you a lift,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going
      West.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; answered Soames, and got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing Irene,&rdquo; said Jolyon when the cab had
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to see her yesterday yourself, I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s my wife, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone, the half-lifted sneering lip, roused sudden anger in Jolyon; but
      he subdued it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know best,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you want a
      divorce it&rsquo;s not very wise to go seeing her, is it? One can&rsquo;t
      run with the hare and hunt with the hounds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good to warn me,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;but I
      have not made up my mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has,&rdquo; said Jolyon, looking straight before him; &ldquo;you
      can&rsquo;t take things up, you know, as they were twelve years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in a damnable
      position, and I am the only person with any legal say in her affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except myself,&rdquo; retorted Soames, &ldquo;who am also in a
      damnable position. Hers is what she made for herself; mine what she made
      for me. I am not at all sure that in her own interests I shan&rsquo;t
      require her to return to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jolyon; and a shiver went through his whole
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you may mean by &lsquo;what,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      answered Soames coldly; &ldquo;your say in her affairs is confined to
      paying out her income; please bear that in mind. In choosing not to
      disgrace her by a divorce, I retained my rights, and, as I say, I am not
      at all sure that I shan&rsquo;t require to exercise them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; ejaculated Jolyon, and he uttered a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames, and there was a deadly quality in his
      voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not forgotten the nickname your father gave me,
      &lsquo;The man of property&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not called names for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is fantastic,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon. Well, the fellow couldn&rsquo;t
      force his wife to live with him. Those days were past, anyway! And he
      looked around at Soames with the thought: &lsquo;Is he real, this man?&rsquo;
      But Soames looked very real, sitting square yet almost elegant with the
      clipped moustache on his pale face, and a tooth showing where a lip was
      lifted in a fixed smile. There was a long silence, while Jolyon thought:
      &lsquo;Instead of helping her, I&rsquo;ve made things worse.&rsquo;
      Suddenly Soames said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the best thing that could happen to her in many ways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At those words such a turmoil began taking place in Jolyon that he could
      barely sit still in the cab. It was as if he were boxed up with hundreds
      of thousands of his countrymen, boxed up with that something in the
      national character which had always been to him revolting, something which
      he knew to be extremely natural and yet which seemed to him inexplicable&mdash;their
      intense belief in contracts and vested rights, their complacent sense of
      virtue in the exaction of those rights. Here beside him in the cab was the
      very embodiment, the corporeal sum as it were, of the possessive instinct&mdash;his
      own kinsman, too! It was uncanny and intolerable! &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s
      something more in it than that!&rsquo; he thought with a sick feeling.
      &lsquo;The dog, they say, returns to his vomit! The sight of her has
      reawakened something. Beauty! The devil&rsquo;s in it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I have not made up my mind. I
      shall be obliged if you will kindly leave her quite alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon bit his lips; he who had always hated rows almost welcomed the
      thought of one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you no such promise,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;then we know where we are. I&rsquo;ll
      get down here.&rdquo; And stopping the cab he got out without word or sign
      of farewell. Jolyon travelled on to his Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first news of the war was being called in the streets, but he paid no
      attention. What could he do to help her? If only his father were alive! He
      could have done so much! But why could he not do all that his father could
      have done? Was he not old enough?&mdash;turned fifty and twice married,
      with grown-up daughters and a son. &lsquo;Queer,&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;If she were plain I shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking twice about it.
      Beauty is the devil, when you&rsquo;re sensitive to it!&rsquo; And into
      the Club reading-room he went with a disturbed heart. In that very room he
      and Bosinney had talked one summer afternoon; he well remembered even now
      the disguised and secret lecture he had given that young man in the
      interests of June, the diagnosis of the Forsytes he had hazarded; and how
      he had wondered what sort of woman it was he was warning him against. And
      now! He was almost in want of a warning himself. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s deuced
      funny!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;really deuced funny!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;SOAMES DISCOVERS WHAT HE WANTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is so much easier to say, &ldquo;Then we know where we are,&rdquo; than
      to mean anything particular by the words. And in saying them Soames did
      but vent the jealous rankling of his instincts. He got out of the cab in a
      state of wary anger&mdash;with himself for not having seen Irene, with
      Jolyon for having seen her; and now with his inability to tell exactly
      what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had abandoned the cab because he could not bear to remain seated beside
      his cousin, and walking briskly eastwards he thought: &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      trust that fellow Jolyon a yard. Once outcast, always outcast!&rsquo; The
      chap had a natural sympathy with&mdash;with&mdash;laxity (he had shied at
      the word sin, because it was too melodramatic for use by a Forsyte).
    </p>
    <p>
      Indecision in desire was to him a new feeling. He was like a child between
      a promised toy and an old one which had been taken away from him; and he
      was astonished at himself. Only last Sunday desire had seemed simple&mdash;just
      his freedom and Annette. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and dine there,&rsquo; he
      thought. To see her might bring back his singleness of intention, calm his
      exasperation, clear his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restaurant was fairly full&mdash;a good many foreigners and folk whom,
      from their appearance, he took to be literary or artistic. Scraps of
      conversation came his way through the clatter of plates and glasses. He
      distinctly heard the Boers sympathised with, the British Government
      blamed. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think much of their clientele,&rsquo; he
      thought. He went stolidly through his dinner and special coffee without
      making his presence known, and when at last he had finished, was careful
      not to be seen going towards the sanctum of Madame Lamotte. They were, as
      he entered, having supper&mdash;such a much nicer-looking supper than the
      dinner he had eaten that he felt a kind of grief&mdash;and they greeted
      him with a surprise so seemingly genuine that he thought with sudden
      suspicion: &lsquo;I believe they knew I was here all the time.&rsquo; He
      gave Annette a look furtive and searching. So pretty, seemingly so candid;
      could she be angling for him? He turned to Madame Lamotte and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dining here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Really! If she had only known! There were dishes she could have
      recommended; what a pity! Soames was confirmed in his suspicion. &lsquo;I
      must look out what I&rsquo;m doing!&rsquo; he thought sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another little cup of very special coffee, monsieur; a liqueur,
      Grand Marnier?&rdquo; and Madame Lamotte rose to order these delicacies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with Annette Soames said, &ldquo;Well, Annette?&rdquo; with a
      defensive little smile about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl blushed. This, which last Sunday would have set his nerves
      tingling, now gave him much the same feeling a man has when a dog that he
      owns wriggles and looks at him. He had a curious sense of power, as if he
      could have said to her, &lsquo;Come and kiss me,&rsquo; and she would have
      come. And yet&mdash;it was strange&mdash;but there seemed another face and
      form in the room too; and the itch in his nerves, was it for that&mdash;or
      for this? He jerked his head towards the restaurant and said: &ldquo;You
      have some queer customers. Do you like this life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette looked up at him for a moment, looked down, and played with her
      fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got her,&rsquo; thought Soames, &lsquo;if I want her.
      But do I want her?&rsquo; She was graceful, she was pretty&mdash;very
      pretty; she was fresh, she had taste of a kind. His eyes travelled round
      the little room; but the eyes of his mind went another journey&mdash;a
      half-light, and silvery walls, a satinwood piano, a woman standing against
      it, reined back as it were from him&mdash;a woman with white shoulders
      that he knew, and dark eyes that he had sought to know, and hair like dull
      dark amber. And as in an artist who strives for the unrealisable and is
      ever thirsty, so there rose in him at that moment the thirst of the old
      passion he had never satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re young. There&rsquo;s
      everything before you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think sometimes there is nothing before me but hard work. I am
      not so in love with work as mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother is a wonder,&rdquo; said Soames, faintly mocking;
      &ldquo;she will never let failure lodge in her house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette sighed. &ldquo;It must be wonderful to be rich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;ll be rich some day,&rdquo; answered Soames, still
      with that faint mockery; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Monsieur is very kind.&rdquo; And
      between her pouting lips she put a chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; thought Soames, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re very
      pretty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamotte, with coffee and liqueur, put an end to that colloquy.
      Soames did not stay long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the streets of Soho, which always gave him such a feeling of
      property improperly owned, he mused. If only Irene had given him a son, he
      wouldn&rsquo;t now be squirming after women! The thought had jumped out of
      its little dark sentry-box in his inner consciousness. A son&mdash;something
      to look forward to, something to make the rest of life worth while,
      something to leave himself to, some perpetuity of self. &lsquo;If I had a
      son,&rsquo; he thought bitterly, &lsquo;a proper legal son, I could make
      shift to go on as I used. One woman&rsquo;s much the same as another,
      after all.&rsquo; But as he walked he shook his head. No! One woman was
      not the same as another. Many a time had he tried to think that in the old
      days of his thwarted married life; and he had always failed. He was
      failing now. He was trying to think Annette the same as that other. But
      she was not, she had not the lure of that old passion. &lsquo;And Irene&rsquo;s
      my wife,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;my legal wife. I have done nothing to
      put her away from me. Why shouldn&rsquo;t she come back to me? It&rsquo;s
      the right thing, the lawful thing. It makes no scandal, no disturbance. If
      it&rsquo;s disagreeable to her&mdash;but why should it be? I&rsquo;m not a
      leper, and she&mdash;she&rsquo;s no longer in love!&rsquo; Why should he
      be put to the shifts and the sordid disgraces and the lurking defeats of
      the Divorce Court, when there she was like an empty house only waiting to
      be retaken into use and possession by him who legally owned her? To one so
      secretive as Soames the thought of reentry into quiet possession of his
      own property with nothing given away to the world was intensely alluring.
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he mused, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I went to see that girl.
      I know now what I want most. If only Irene will come back I&rsquo;ll be as
      considerate as she wishes; she could live her own life; but perhaps&mdash;perhaps
      she would come round to me.&rsquo; There was a lump in his throat. And
      doggedly along by the railings of the Green Park, towards his father&rsquo;s
      house, he went, trying to tread on his shadow walking before him in the
      brilliant moonlight.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE THIRD GENERATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolly Forsyte was strolling down High Street, Oxford, on a November
      afternoon; Val Dartie was strolling up. Jolly had just changed out of
      boating flannels and was on his way to the &lsquo;Frying-pan,&rsquo; to
      which he had recently been elected. Val had just changed out of riding
      clothes and was on his way to the fire&mdash;a bookmaker&rsquo;s in
      Cornmarket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; replied Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousins had met but twice, Jolly, the second-year man, having invited
      the freshman to breakfast; and last evening they had seen each other again
      under somewhat exotic circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over a tailor&rsquo;s in the Cornmarket resided one of those privileged
      young beings called minors, whose inheritances are large, whose parents
      are dead, whose guardians are remote, and whose instincts are vicious. At
      nineteen he had commenced one of those careers attractive and inexplicable
      to ordinary mortals for whom a single bankruptcy is good as a feast.
      Already famous for having the only roulette table then to be found in
      Oxford, he was anticipating his expectations at a dazzling rate. He
      out-crummed Crum, though of a sanguine and rather beefy type which lacked
      the latter&rsquo;s fascinating languor. For Val it had been in the nature
      of baptism to be taken there to play roulette; in the nature of
      confirmation to get back into college, after hours, through a window whose
      bars were deceptive. Once, during that evening of delight, glancing up
      from the seductive green before him, he had caught sight, through a cloud
      of smoke, of his cousin standing opposite. &lsquo;Rouge gagne, impair, et
      manque!&rsquo; He had not seen him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in to the Frying-pan and have tea,&rdquo; said Jolly, and they
      went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger, seeing them together, would have noticed an unseizable
      resemblance between these second cousins of the third generations of
      Forsytes; the same bone formation in face, though Jolly&rsquo;s eyes were
      darker grey, his hair lighter and more wavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea and buttered buns, waiter, please,&rdquo; said Jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one of my cigarettes?&rdquo; said Val. &ldquo;I saw you last
      night. How did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won fifteen quid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though desirous of repeating a whimsical comment on gambling he had once
      heard his father make&mdash;&rsquo;When you&rsquo;re fleeced you&rsquo;re
      sick, and when you fleece you&rsquo;re sorry&mdash;Jolly contented himself
      with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten game, I think; I was at school with that chap. He&rsquo;s an
      awful fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Val, as one might speak in
      defence of a disparaged god; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a pretty good sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged whiffs in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met my people, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Jolly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      coming up to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grew a little red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! I can give you a rare good tip for the Manchester November
      handicap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I only take interest in the classic races.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make any money over them,&rdquo; said Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the ring,&rdquo; said Jolly; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s such a row
      and stink. I like the paddock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to back my judgment,&rdquo; answered Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly smiled; his smile was like his father&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any. I always lose money if I bet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to buy experience, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s all messed-up with doing people in the eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, or they&rsquo;ll do you&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      excitement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly looked a little scornful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do with yourself? Row?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;ride, and drive about. I&rsquo;m going to play polo next
      term, if I can get my granddad to stump up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Uncle James, isn&rsquo;t it? What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Older than forty hills,&rdquo; said Val, &ldquo;and always thinking
      he&rsquo;s going to be ruined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose my granddad and he were brothers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of that old lot were sportsmen,&rdquo;
      said Val; &ldquo;they must have worshipped money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Jolly warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val flipped the ash off his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money&rsquo;s only fit to spend,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wish the
      deuce I had more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly gave him that direct upward look of judgment which he had inherited
      from old Jolyon: One didn&rsquo;t talk about money! And again there was
      silence, while they drank tea and ate the buttered buns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your people going to stay?&rdquo; asked Val, elaborately
      casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rainbow.&rsquo; What do you think of the war?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten, so far. The Boers aren&rsquo;t sports a bit. Why don&rsquo;t
      they come out into the open?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they? They&rsquo;ve got everything against them except
      their way of fighting. I rather admire them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can ride and shoot,&rdquo; admitted Val, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re
      a lousy lot. Do you know Crum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Merton? Only by sight. He&rsquo;s in that fast set too, isn&rsquo;t
      he? Rather La-di-da and Brummagem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val said fixedly: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Sorry!&rdquo; And they sat awkwardly staring past each other,
      having pitched on their pet points of snobbery. For Jolly was forming
      himself unconsciously on a set whose motto was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We defy you to bore us. Life isn&rsquo;t half long enough, and we&rsquo;re
      going to talk faster and more crisply, do more and know more, and dwell
      less on any subject than you can possibly imagine. We are &ldquo;the best&rdquo;&mdash;made
      of wire and whipcord.&rsquo; And Val was unconsciously forming himself on
      a set whose motto was: &lsquo;We defy you to interest or excite us. We
      have had every sensation, or if we haven&rsquo;t, we pretend we have. We
      are so exhausted with living that no hours are too small for us. We will
      lose our shirts with equanimity. We have flown fast and are past
      everything. All is cigarette smoke. Bismillah!&rsquo; Competitive spirit,
      bone-deep in the English, was obliging those two young Forsytes to have
      ideals; and at the close of a century ideals are mixed. The aristocracy
      had already in the main adopted the &lsquo;jumping-Jesus&rsquo; principle;
      though here and there one like Crum&mdash;who was an &lsquo;honourable&rsquo;&mdash;stood
      starkly languid for that gambler&rsquo;s Nirvana which had been the summum
      bonum of the old &lsquo;dandies&rsquo; and of &lsquo;the mashers&rsquo; in
      the eighties. And round Crum were still gathered a forlorn hope of
      blue-bloods with a plutocratic following.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was between the cousins another far less obvious antipathy&mdash;coming
      from the unseizable family resemblance, which each perhaps resented; or
      from some half-consciousness of that old feud persisting still between
      their branches of the clan, formed within them by odd words or half-hints
      dropped by their elders. And Jolly, tinkling his teaspoon, was musing:
      &lsquo;His tie-pin and his waistcoat and his drawl and his betting&mdash;good
      Lord!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Val, finishing his bun, was thinking: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s rather a young
      beast!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be meeting your people?&rdquo; he said,
      getting up. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell them I should like to show them
      over B.N.C.&mdash;not that there&rsquo;s anything much there&mdash;if they&rsquo;d
      care to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll ask them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would they lunch? I&rsquo;ve got rather a decent scout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly doubted if they would have time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll ask them, though?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; said Jolly, fully meaning that they should
      not go; but, instinctively polite, he added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
      come and have dinner with us to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather. What time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven-thirty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And they parted, a subtle antagonism alive within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly and her father arrived by a midday train. It was her first visit to
      the city of spires and dreams, and she was very silent, looking almost
      shyly at the brother who was part of this wonderful place. After lunch she
      wandered, examining his household gods with intense curiosity. Jolly&rsquo;s
      sitting-room was panelled, and Art represented by a set of Bartolozzi
      prints which had belonged to old Jolyon, and by college photographs&mdash;of
      young men, live young men, a little heroic, and to be compared with her
      memories of Val. Jolyon also scrutinised with care that evidence of his
      boy&rsquo;s character and tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly was anxious that they should see him rowing, so they set forth to
      the river. Holly, between her brother and her father, felt elated when
      heads were turned and eyes rested on her. That they might see him to the
      best advantage they left him at the Barge and crossed the river to the
      towing-path. Slight in build&mdash;for of all the Forsytes only old
      Swithin and George were beefy&mdash;Jolly was rowing &lsquo;Two&rsquo; in
      a trial eight. He looked very earnest and strenuous. With pride Jolyon
      thought him the best-looking boy of the lot; Holly, as became a sister,
      was more struck by one or two of the others, but would not have said so
      for the world. The river was bright that afternoon, the meadows lush, the
      trees still beautiful with colour. Distinguished peace clung around the
      old city; Jolyon promised himself a day&rsquo;s sketching if the weather
      held. The Eight passed a second time, spurting home along the Barges&mdash;Jolly&rsquo;s
      face was very set, so as not to show that he was blown. They returned
      across the river and waited for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jolly in the Christ Church meadows, &ldquo;I had to
      ask that chap Val Dartie to dine with us to-night. He wanted to give you
      lunch and show you B.N.C., so I thought I&rsquo;d better; then you needn&rsquo;t
      go. I don&rsquo;t like him much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly&rsquo;s rather sallow face had become suffused with pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know. He seems to me rather showy and bad form.
      What are his people like, Dad? He&rsquo;s only a second cousin, isn&rsquo;t
      he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon took refuge in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Holly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she saw his uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked Val,&rdquo; Holly answered, staring at the ground before
      her; &ldquo;his uncle looked&mdash;awfully different.&rdquo; She stole a
      glance at Jolly from under her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever,&rdquo; said Jolyon with whimsical intention, &ldquo;hear
      our family history, my dears? It&rsquo;s quite a fairy tale. The first
      Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;at all events the first we know anything of, and that
      would be your great-great-grandfather&mdash;dwelt in the land of Dorset on
      the edge of the sea, being by profession an &lsquo;agriculturalist,&rsquo;
      as your great-aunt put it, and the son of an agriculturist&mdash;farmers,
      in fact; your grandfather used to call them, &lsquo;Very small beer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      He looked at Jolly to see how his lordliness was standing it, and with the
      other eye noted Holly&rsquo;s malicious pleasure in the slight drop of her
      brother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may suppose him thick and sturdy, standing for England as it was
      before the Industrial Era began. The second Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;your
      great-grandfather, Jolly; better known as Superior Dosset Forsyte&mdash;built
      houses, so the chronicle runs, begat ten children, and migrated to London
      town. It is known that he drank sherry. We may suppose him representing
      the England of Napoleon&rsquo;s wars, and general unrest. The eldest of
      his six sons was the third Jolyon, your grandfather, my dears&mdash;tea
      merchant and chairman of companies, one of the soundest Englishmen who
      ever lived&mdash;and to me the dearest.&rdquo; Jolyon&rsquo;s voice had
      lost its irony, and his son and daughter gazed at him solemnly, &ldquo;He
      was just and tenacious, tender and young at heart. You remember him, and I
      remember him. Pass to the others! Your great-uncle James, that&rsquo;s
      young Val&rsquo;s grandfather, had a son called Soames&mdash;whereby hangs
      a tale of no love lost, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll tell it you.
      James and the other eight children of &lsquo;Superior Dosset,&rsquo; of
      whom there are still five alive, may be said to have represented Victorian
      England, with its principles of trade and individualism at five per cent.
      and your money back&mdash;if you know what that means. At all events they&rsquo;ve
      turned thirty thousand pounds into a cool million between them in the
      course of their long lives. They never did a wild thing&mdash;unless it
      was your great-uncle Swithin, who I believe was once swindled at
      thimble-rig, and was called &lsquo;Four-in-hand Forsyte&rsquo; because he
      drove a pair. Their day is passing, and their type, not altogether for the
      advantage of the country. They were pedestrian, but they too were sound. I
      am the fourth Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;a poor holder of the name&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad,&rdquo; said Jolly, and Holly squeezed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Jolyon, &ldquo;a poor specimen, representing,
      I&rsquo;m afraid, nothing but the end of the century, unearned income,
      amateurism, and individual liberty&mdash;a different thing from
      individualism, Jolly. You are the fifth Jolyon Forsyte, old man, and you
      open the ball of the new century.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke they turned in through the college gates, and Holly said:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fascinating, Dad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them quite knew what she meant. Jolly was grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rainbow, distinguished, as only an Oxford hostel can be, for lack of
      modernity, provided one small oak-panelled private sitting-room, in which
      Holly sat to receive, white-frocked, shy, and alone, when the only guest
      arrived. Rather as one would touch a moth, Val took her hand. And wouldn&rsquo;t
      she wear this &lsquo;measly flower&rsquo;. It would look ripping in her
      hair. He removed a gardenia from his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! No, thank you&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; But she took it
      and pinned it at her neck, having suddenly remembered that word &lsquo;showy&rsquo;.
      Val&rsquo;s buttonhole would give offence; and she so much wanted Jolly to
      like him. Did she realise that Val was at his best and quietest in her
      presence, and was that, perhaps, half the secret of his attraction for
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything about our ride, Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather not! It&rsquo;s just between us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the uneasiness of his hands and the fidgeting of his feet he was giving
      her a sense of power very delicious; a soft feeling too&mdash;the wish to
      make him happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me about Oxford. It must be ever so lovely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val admitted that it was frightfully decent to do what you liked; the
      lectures were nothing; and there were some very good chaps. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo;
      he added, &ldquo;of course I wish I was in town, and could come down and
      see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly moved one hand shyly on her knee, and her glance dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; he said, suddenly gathering
      courage, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re going mad-rabbiting together?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That was only make-believe. One can&rsquo;t do that sort of
      thing after one&rsquo;s grown up, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it! cousins can,&rdquo; said Val. &ldquo;Next Long Vac.&mdash;it
      begins in June, you know, and goes on for ever&mdash;we&rsquo;ll watch our
      chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though the thrill of conspiracy ran through her veins, Holly shook
      her head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t come off,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; said Val fervently; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s going
      to stop it? Not your father or your brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Jolyon and Jolly came in; and romance fled into Val&rsquo;s
      patent leather and Holly&rsquo;s white satin toes, where it itched and
      tingled during an evening not conspicuous for open-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensitive to atmosphere, Jolyon soon felt the latent antagonism between
      the boys, and was puzzled by Holly; so he became unconsciously ironical,
      which is fatal to the expansiveness of youth. A letter, handed to him
      after dinner, reduced him to a silence hardly broken till Jolly and Val
      rose to go. He went out with them, smoking his cigar, and walked with his
      son to the gates of Christ Church. Turning back, he took out the letter
      and read it again beneath a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR JOLYON,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames came again to-night&mdash;my thirty-seventh birthday. You
      were right, I mustn&rsquo;t stay here. I&rsquo;m going to-morrow to the
      Piedmont Hotel, but I won&rsquo;t go abroad without seeing you. I feel
      lonely and down-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IRENE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded the letter back into his pocket and walked on, astonished at the
      violence of his feelings. What had the fellow said or done?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned into High Street, down the Turf, and on among a maze of spires
      and domes and long college fronts and walls, bright or dark-shadowed in
      the strong moonlight. In this very heart of England&rsquo;s gentility it
      was difficult to realise that a lonely woman could be importuned or
      hunted, but what else could her letter mean? Soames must have been
      pressing her to go back to him again, with public opinion and the Law on
      his side, too! &lsquo;Eighteen-ninety-nine!,&rsquo; he thought, gazing at
      the broken glass shining on the top of a villa garden wall; &lsquo;but
      when it comes to property we&rsquo;re still a heathen people! I&rsquo;ll
      go up to-morrow morning. I dare say it&rsquo;ll be best for her to go
      abroad.&rsquo; Yet the thought displeased him. Why should Soames hunt her
      out of England! Besides, he might follow, and out there she would be still
      more helpless against the attentions of her own husband! &lsquo;I must
      tread warily,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;that fellow could make himself
      very nasty. I didn&rsquo;t like his manner in the cab the other night.&rsquo;
      His thoughts turned to his daughter June. Could she help? Once on a time
      Irene had been her greatest friend, and now she was a &lsquo;lame duck,&rsquo;
      such as must appeal to June&rsquo;s nature! He determined to wire to his
      daughter to meet him at Paddington Station. Retracing his steps towards
      the Rainbow he questioned his own sensations. Would he be upsetting
      himself over every woman in like case? No! he would not. The candour of
      this conclusion discomfited him; and, finding that Holly had gone up to
      bed, he sought his own room. But he could not sleep, and sat for a long
      time at his window, huddled in an overcoat, watching the moonlight on the
      roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next door Holly too was awake, thinking of the lashes above and below Val&rsquo;s
      eyes, especially below; and of what she could do to make Jolly like him
      better. The scent of the gardenia was strong in her little bedroom, and
      pleasant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Val, leaning out of his first-floor window in B.N.C., was gazing at a
      moonlit quadrangle without seeing it at all, seeing instead Holly, slim
      and white-frocked, as she sat beside the fire when he first went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jolly, in his bedroom narrow as a ghost, lay with a hand beneath his
      cheek and dreamed he was with Val in one boat, rowing a race against him,
      while his father was calling from the towpath: &lsquo;Two! Get your hands
      away there, bless you!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;SOAMES PUTS IT TO THE TOUCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all those radiant firms which emblazon with their windows the West End
      of London, Gaves and Cortegal were considered by Soames the most &lsquo;attractive&rsquo;
      word just coming into fashion. He had never had his Uncle Swithin&rsquo;s
      taste in precious stones, and the abandonment by Irene when she left his
      house in 1887 of all the glittering things he had given her had disgusted
      him with this form of investment. But he still knew a diamond when he saw
      one, and during the week before her birthday he had taken occasion, on his
      way into the Poultry or his way out therefrom, to dally a little before
      the greater jewellers where one got, if not one&rsquo;s money&rsquo;s
      worth, at least a certain cachet with the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constant cogitation since his drive with Jolyon had convinced him more and
      more of the supreme importance of this moment in his life, the supreme
      need for taking steps and those not wrong. And, alongside the dry and
      reasoned sense that it was now or never with his self-preservation, now or
      never if he were to range himself and found a family, went the secret urge
      of his senses roused by the sight of her who had once been a passionately
      desired wife, and the conviction that it was a sin against common sense
      and the decent secrecy of Forsytes to waste the wife he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an opinion on Winifred&rsquo;s case, Dreamer, Q.C.&mdash;he would much
      have preferred Waterbuck, but they had made him a judge (so late in the
      day as to rouse the usual suspicion of a political job)&mdash;had advised
      that they should go forward and obtain restitution of conjugal rights, a
      point which to Soames had never been in doubt. When they had obtained a
      decree to that effect they must wait to see if it was obeyed. If not, it
      would constitute legal desertion, and they should obtain evidence of
      misconduct and file their petition for divorce. All of which Soames knew
      perfectly well. They had marked him ten and one. This simplicity in his
      sister&rsquo;s case only made him the more desperate about the difficulty
      in his own. Everything, in fact, was driving him towards the simple
      solution of Irene&rsquo;s return. If it were still against the grain with
      her, had he not feelings to subdue, injury to forgive, pain to forget? He
      at least had never injured her, and this was a world of compromise! He
      could offer her so much more than she had now. He would be prepared to
      make a liberal settlement on her which could not be upset. He often
      scrutinised his image in these days. He had never been a peacock like that
      fellow Dartie, or fancied himself a woman&rsquo;s man, but he had a
      certain belief in his own appearance&mdash;not unjustly, for it was
      well-coupled and preserved, neat, healthy, pale, unblemished by drink or
      excess of any kind. The Forsyte jaw and the concentration of his face
      were, in his eyes, virtues. So far as he could tell there was no feature
      of him which need inspire dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts and yearnings, with which one lives daily, become natural, even
      if far-fetched in their inception. If he could only give tangible proof
      enough of his determination to let bygones be bygones, and to do all in
      his power to please her, why should she not come back to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered Gaves and Cortegal&rsquo;s therefore, on the morning of
      November the 9th, to buy a certain diamond brooch. &ldquo;Four twenty-five
      and dirt cheap, sir, at the money. It&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s brooch.&rdquo;
      There was that in his mood which made him accept without demur. And he
      went on into the Poultry with the flat green morocco case in his breast
      pocket. Several times that day he opened it to look at the seven soft
      shining stones in their velvet oval nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the lady doesn&rsquo;t like it, sir, happy to exchange it any
      time. But there&rsquo;s no fear of that.&rdquo; If only there were not! He
      got through a vast amount of work, only soother of the nerves he knew. A
      cablegram came while he was in the office with details from the agent in
      Buenos Aires, and the name and address of a stewardess who would be
      prepared to swear to what was necessary. It was a timely spur to Soames,
      with his rooted distaste for the washing of dirty linen in public. And
      when he set forth by Underground to Victoria Station he received a fresh
      impetus towards the renewal of his married life from the account in his
      evening paper of a fashionable divorce suit. The homing instinct of all
      true Forsytes in anxiety and trouble, the corporate tendency which kept
      them strong and solid, made him choose to dine at Park Lane. He neither
      could nor would breath a word to his people of his intention&mdash;too
      reticent and proud&mdash;but the thought that at least they would be glad
      if they knew, and wish him luck, was heartening.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was in lugubrious mood, for the fire which the impudence of Kruger&rsquo;s
      ultimatum had lit in him had been cold-watered by the poor success of the
      last month, and the exhortations to effort in The Times. He didn&rsquo;t
      know where it would end. Soames sought to cheer him by the continual use
      of the word Buller. But James couldn&rsquo;t tell! There was Colley&mdash;and
      he got stuck on that hill, and this Ladysmith was down in a hollow, and
      altogether it looked to him a &lsquo;pretty kettle of fish&rsquo;. he
      thought they ought to be sending the sailors&mdash;they were the chaps,
      they did a lot of good in the Crimea. Soames shifted the ground of
      consolation. Winifred had heard from Val that there had been a &lsquo;rag&rsquo;
      and a bonfire on Guy Fawkes Day at Oxford, and that he had escaped
      detection by blacking his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; James muttered, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a clever little chap.&rdquo;
      But he shook his head shortly afterwards and remarked that he didn&rsquo;t
      know what would become of him, and looking wistfully at his son, murmured
      on that Soames had never had a boy. He would have liked a grandson of his
      own name. And now&mdash;well, there it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames flinched. He had not expected such a challenge to disclose the
      secret in his heart. And Emily, who saw him wince, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, James; don&rsquo;t talk like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But James, not looking anyone in the face, muttered on. There were Roger
      and Nicholas and Jolyon; they all had grandsons. And Swithin and Timothy
      had never married. He had done his best; but he would soon be gone now.
      And, as though he had uttered words of profound consolation, he was
      silent, eating brains with a fork and a piece of bread, and swallowing the
      bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames excused himself directly after dinner. It was not really cold, but
      he put on his fur coat, which served to fortify him against the fits of
      nervous shivering to which he had been subject all day. Subconsciously, he
      knew that he looked better thus than in an ordinary black overcoat. Then,
      feeling the morocco case flat against his heart, he sallied forth. He was
      no smoker, but he lit a cigarette, and smoked it gingerly as he walked
      along. He moved slowly down the Row towards Knightsbridge, timing himself
      to get to Chelsea at nine-fifteen. What did she do with herself evening
      after evening in that little hole? How mysterious women were! One lived
      alongside and knew nothing of them. What could she have seen in that
      fellow Bosinney to send her mad? For there was madness after all in what
      she had done&mdash;crazy moonstruck madness, in which all sense of values
      had been lost, and her life and his life ruined! And for a moment he was
      filled with a sort of exaltation, as though he were a man read of in a
      story who, possessed by the Christian spirit, would restore to her all the
      prizes of existence, forgiving and forgetting, and becoming the godfather
      of her future. Under a tree opposite Knightsbridge Barracks, where the
      moon-light struck down clear and white, he took out once more the morocco
      case, and let the beams draw colour from those stones. Yes, they were of
      the first water! But, at the hard closing snap of the case, another cold
      shiver ran through his nerves; and he walked on faster, clenching his
      gloved hands in the pockets of his coat, almost hoping she would not be
      in. The thought of how mysterious she was again beset him. Dining alone
      there night after night&mdash;in an evening dress, too, as if she were
      making believe to be in society! Playing the piano&mdash;to herself! Not
      even a dog or cat, so far as he had seen. And that reminded him suddenly
      of the mare he kept for station work at Mapledurham. If ever he went to
      the stable, there she was quite alone, half asleep, and yet, on her home
      journeys going more freely than on her way out, as if longing to be back
      and lonely in her stable! &lsquo;I would treat her well,&rsquo; he thought
      incoherently. &lsquo;I would be very careful.&rsquo; And all that capacity
      for home life of which a mocking Fate seemed for ever to have deprived him
      swelled suddenly in Soames, so that he dreamed dreams opposite South
      Kensington Station. In the King&rsquo;s Road a man came slithering out of
      a public house playing a concertina. Soames watched him for a moment dance
      crazily on the pavement to his own drawling jagged sounds, then crossed
      over to avoid contact with this piece of drunken foolery. A night in the
      lock-up! What asses people were! But the man had noticed his movement of
      avoidance, and streams of genial blasphemy followed him across the street.
      &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll run him in,&rsquo; thought Soames viciously.
      &lsquo;To have ruffians like that about, with women out alone!&rsquo; A
      woman&rsquo;s figure in front had induced this thought. Her walk seemed
      oddly familiar, and when she turned the corner for which he was bound, his
      heart began to beat. He hastened on to the corner to make certain. Yes! It
      was Irene; he could not mistake her walk in that little drab street. She
      threaded two more turnings, and from the last corner he saw her enter her
      block of flats. To make sure of her now, he ran those few paces, hurried
      up the stairs, and caught her standing at her door. He heard the latchkey
      in the lock, and reached her side just as she turned round, startled, in
      the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; he said, breathless. &ldquo;I
      happened to see you. Let me come in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put her hand up to her breast, her face was colourless, her eyes
      widened by alarm. Then seeming to master herself, she inclined her head,
      and said: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames closed the door. He, too, had need to recover, and when she had
      passed into the sitting-room, waited a full minute, taking deep breaths to
      still the beating of his heart. At this moment, so fraught with the
      future, to take out that morocco case seemed crude. Yet, not to take it
      out left him there before her with no preliminary excuse for coming. And
      in this dilemma he was seized with impatience at all this paraphernalia of
      excuse and justification. This was a scene&mdash;it could be nothing else,
      and he must face it. He heard her voice, uncomfortably, pathetically soft:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you come again? Didn&rsquo;t you understand that I would
      rather you did not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed her clothes&mdash;a dark brown velvet corduroy, a sable boa, a
      small round toque of the same. They suited her admirably. She had money to
      spare for dress, evidently! He said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your birthday. I brought you this,&rdquo; and he held
      out to her the green morocco case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! No-no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames pressed the clasp; the seven stones gleamed out on the pale grey
      velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just as a sign that you don&rsquo;t
      bear me ill-feeling any longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took it out of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me just see how it looks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed, thrusting his hand with the brooch in it against the front of
      her dress. She shrank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames dropped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let bygones be bygones. If I can,
      surely you might. Let&rsquo;s begin again, as if nothing had been. Won&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; His voice was wistful, and his eyes, resting on her face, had
      in them a sort of supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, who was standing literally with her back against the wall, gave a
      little gulp, and that was all her answer. Soames went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you really want to live all your days half-dead in this little
      hole? Come back to me, and I&rsquo;ll give you all you want. You shall
      live your own life; I swear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her face quiver ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;but I mean it this time. I&rsquo;ll
      only ask one thing. I just want&mdash;I just want a son. Don&rsquo;t look
      like that! I want one. It&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo; His voice had grown
      hurried, so that he hardly knew it for his own, and twice he jerked his
      head back as if struggling for breath. It was the sight of her eyes fixed
      on him, dark with a sort of fascinated fright, which pulled him together
      and changed that painful incoherence to anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so very unnatural?&rdquo; he said between his teeth, &ldquo;Is
      it unnatural to want a child from one&rsquo;s own wife? You wrecked our
      life and put this blight on everything. We go on only half alive, and
      without any future. Is it so very unflattering to you that in spite of
      everything I&mdash;I still want you for my wife? Speak, for Goodness&rsquo;
      sake! do speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene seemed to try, but did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you,&rdquo; said Soames more gently.
      &ldquo;Heaven knows. I only want you to see that I can&rsquo;t go on like
      this. I want you back. I want you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene raised one hand and covered the lower part of her face, but her eyes
      never moved from his, as though she trusted in them to keep him at bay.
      And all those years, barren and bitter, since&mdash;ah! when?&mdash;almost
      since he had first known her, surged up in one great wave of recollection
      in Soames; and a spasm that for his life he could not control constricted
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not&mdash;if
      you&rsquo;ll only believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene uncovered her lips, and both her hands made a writhing gesture in
      front of her breast. Soames seized them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said under her breath. But he stood holding
      on to them, trying to stare into her eyes which did not waver. Then she
      said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am alone here. You won&rsquo;t behave again as you once behaved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping her hands as though they had been hot irons, he turned away. Was
      it possible that there could be such relentless unforgiveness! Could that
      one act of violent possession be still alive within her? Did it bar him
      thus utterly? And doggedly he said, without looking up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going till you&rsquo;ve answered me. I am offering what
      few men would bring themselves to offer, I want a&mdash;a reasonable
      answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And almost with surprise he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a reasonable answer. Reason has nothing to do
      with it. You can only have the brutal truth: I would rather die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said. And there intervened in him a sort of paralysis
      of speech and movement, the kind of quivering which comes when a man has
      received a deadly insult, and does not yet know how he is going to take
      it, or rather what it is going to do with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;as bad as that? Indeed! You would
      rather die. That&rsquo;s pretty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. You wanted me to answer. I can&rsquo;t help the truth,
      can I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that queer spiritual appeal Soames turned for relief to actuality. He
      snapped the brooch back into its case and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing with
      women. It&rsquo;s nerves-nerves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; nerves don&rsquo;t lie. Haven&rsquo;t you discovered that?&rdquo;
      He was silent, obsessed by the thought: &lsquo;I will hate this woman. I
      will hate her.&rsquo; That was the trouble! If only he could! He shot a
      glance at her who stood unmoving against the wall with her head up and her
      hands clasped, for all the world as if she were going to be shot. And he
      said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. You have a lover. If you hadn&rsquo;t,
      you wouldn&rsquo;t be such a&mdash;such a little idiot.&rdquo; He was
      conscious, before the expression in her eyes, that he had uttered
      something of a non-sequitur, and dropped back too abruptly into the verbal
      freedom of his connubial days. He turned away to the door. But he could
      not go out. Something within him&mdash;that most deep and secret Forsyte
      quality, the impossibility of letting go, the impossibility of seeing the
      fantastic and forlorn nature of his own tenacity&mdash;prevented him. He
      turned about again, and there stood, with his back against the door, as
      hers was against the wall opposite, quite unconscious of anything
      ridiculous in this separation by the whole width of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever think of anybody but yourself?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s lips quivered; then she answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever think that I found out my mistake&mdash;my hopeless,
      terrible mistake&mdash;the very first week of our marriage; that I went on
      trying three years&mdash;you know I went on trying? Was it for myself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gritted his teeth. &ldquo;God knows what it was. I&rsquo;ve never
      understood you; I shall never understand you. You had everything you
      wanted; and you can have it again, and more. What&rsquo;s the matter with
      me? I ask you a plain question: What is it?&rdquo; Unconscious of the
      pathos in that enquiry, he went on passionately: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      lame, I&rsquo;m not loathsome, I&rsquo;m not a boor, I&rsquo;m not a fool.
      What is it? What&rsquo;s the mystery about me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was a long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped his hands with a gesture that for him was strangely full of
      expression. &ldquo;When I came here to-night I was&mdash;I hoped&mdash;I
      meant everything that I could to do away with the past, and start fair
      again. And you meet me with &lsquo;nerves,&rsquo; and silence, and sighs.
      There&rsquo;s nothing tangible. It&rsquo;s like&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a
      spider&rsquo;s web.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That whisper from across the room maddened Soames afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t choose to be in a spider&rsquo;s web. I&rsquo;ll
      cut it.&rdquo; He walked straight up to her. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; What he
      had gone up to her to do he really did not know. But when he was close,
      the old familiar scent of her clothes suddenly affected him. He put his
      hands on her shoulders and bent forward to kiss her. He kissed not her
      lips, but a little hard line where the lips had been drawn in; then his
      face was pressed away by her hands; he heard her say: &ldquo;Oh! No!&rdquo;
      Shame, compunction, sense of futility flooded his whole being, he turned
      on his heel and went straight out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;VISIT TO IRENE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolyon found June waiting on the platform at Paddington. She had received
      his telegram while at breakfast. Her abode&mdash;a studio and two bedrooms
      in a St. John&rsquo;s Wood garden&mdash;had been selected by her for the
      complete independence which it guaranteed. Unwatched by Mrs. Grundy,
      unhindered by permanent domestics, she could receive lame ducks at any
      hour of day or night, and not seldom had a duck without studio of its own
      made use of June&rsquo;s. She enjoyed her freedom, and possessed herself
      with a sort of virginal passion; the warmth which she would have lavished
      on Bosinney, and of which&mdash;given her Forsyte tenacity&mdash;he must
      surely have tired, she now expended in championship of the underdogs and
      budding &lsquo;geniuses&rsquo; of the artistic world. She lived, in fact,
      to turn ducks into the swans she believed they were. The very fervour of
      her protection warped her judgments. But she was loyal and liberal; her
      small eager hand was ever against the oppressions of academic and
      commercial opinion, and though her income was considerable, her bank
      balance was often a minus quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to Paddington Station heated in her soul by a visit to Eric
      Cobbley. A miserable Gallery had refused to let that straight-haired
      genius have his one-man show after all. Its impudent manager, after
      visiting his studio, had expressed the opinion that it would only be a
      &lsquo;one-horse show from the selling point of view.&rsquo; This crowning
      example of commercial cowardice towards her favourite lame duck&mdash;and
      he so hard up, with a wife and two children, that he had caused her
      account to be overdrawn&mdash;was still making the blood glow in her
      small, resolute face, and her red-gold hair to shine more than ever. She
      gave her father a hug, and got into a cab with him, having as many fish to
      fry with him as he with her. It became at once a question which would fry
      them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon had reached the words: &ldquo;My dear, I want you to come with me,&rdquo;
      when, glancing at her face, he perceived by her blue eyes moving from side
      to side&mdash;like the tail of a preoccupied cat&mdash;that she was not
      attending. &ldquo;Dad, is it true that I absolutely can&rsquo;t get at any
      of my money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the income, fortunately, my love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly beastly! Can&rsquo;t it be done somehow? There must
      be a way. I know I could buy a small Gallery for ten thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small Gallery,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon, &ldquo;seems a modest
      desire. But your grandfather foresaw it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; cried June vigorously, &ldquo;that all this care
      about money is awful, when there&rsquo;s so much genius in the world
      simply crushed out for want of a little. I shall never marry and have
      children; why shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to do some good instead of having
      it all tied up in case of things which will never come off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our name is Forsyte, my dear,&rdquo; replied Jolyon in the ironical
      voice to which his impetuous daughter had never quite grown accustomed;
      &ldquo;and Forsytes, you know, are people who so settle their property
      that their grandchildren, in case they should die before their parents,
      have to make wills leaving the property that will only come to themselves
      when their parents die. Do you follow that? Nor do I, but it&rsquo;s a
      fact, anyway; we live by the principle that so long as there is a
      possibility of keeping wealth in the family it must not go out; if you die
      unmarried, your money goes to Jolly and Holly and their children if they
      marry. Isn&rsquo;t it pleasant to know that whatever you do you can none
      of you be destitute?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t I borrow the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon shook his head. &ldquo;You could rent a Gallery, no doubt, if you
      could manage it out of your income.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June uttered a contemptuous sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and have no income left to help anybody with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it
      come to the same thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said June shrewdly, &ldquo;I could buy for ten thousand;
      that would only be four hundred a year. But I should have to pay a
      thousand a year rent, and that would only leave me five hundred. If I had
      the Gallery, Dad, think what I could do. I could make Eric Cobbley&rsquo;s
      name in no time, and ever so many others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Names worth making make themselves in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever know anybody living, my dear, improved by having his
      name made?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you,&rdquo; said June, pressing his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon started. &lsquo;I?&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Oh! Ah! Now she&rsquo;s
      going to ask me to do something. We take it out, we Forsytes, each in our
      different ways.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June came closer to him in the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you buy the Gallery, and I&rsquo;ll
      pay you four hundred a year for it. Then neither of us will be any the
      worse off. Besides, it&rsquo;s a splendid investment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon wriggled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      for an artist to buy a Gallery is a bit dubious? Besides, ten thousand
      pounds is a lump, and I&rsquo;m not a commercial character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June looked at him with admiring appraisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re not, but you&rsquo;re awfully businesslike.
      And I&rsquo;m sure we could make it pay. It&rsquo;ll be a perfect way of
      scoring off those wretched dealers and people.&rdquo; And again she
      squeezed her father&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon&rsquo;s face expressed quizzical despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this desirable Gallery? Splendidly situated, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just off Cork Street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought Jolyon, &lsquo;I knew it was just off somewhere.
      Now for what I want out of her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll think of it, but not just now. You remember Irene?
      I want you to come with me and see her. Soames is after her again. She
      might be safer if we could give her asylum somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The word asylum, which he had used by chance, was of all most calculated
      to rouse June&rsquo;s interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene! I haven&rsquo;t seen her since! Of course! I&rsquo;d love to
      help her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jolyon&rsquo;s turn to squeeze her arm, in warm admiration for this
      spirited, generous-hearted little creature of his begetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene is proud,&rdquo; he said, with a sidelong glance, in sudden
      doubt of June&rsquo;s discretion; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s difficult to help. We
      must tread gently. This is the place. I wired her to expect us. Let&rsquo;s
      send up our cards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear Soames,&rdquo; said June as she got out; &ldquo;he
      sneers at everything that isn&rsquo;t successful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was in what was called the &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; drawing-room&rsquo;
      of the Piedmont Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing if not morally courageous, June walked straight up to her former
      friend, kissed her cheek, and the two settled down on a sofa never sat on
      since the hotel&rsquo;s foundation. Jolyon could see that Irene was deeply
      affected by this simple forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Soames has been worrying you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a visit from him last night; he wants me to go back to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going, of course?&rdquo; cried June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled faintly and shook her head. &ldquo;But his position is
      horrible,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own fault; he ought to have divorced you when he
      could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days June had hoped that no
      divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lover&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear what Irene is going to do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s lips quivered, but she spoke calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; cried June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can I do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the question,&rdquo; said Jolyon very quietly, &ldquo;sans
      amour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought she was going to cry; but, getting up quickly, she half turned
      her back on them, and stood regaining control of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      June said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall go to Soames and tell him he must leave you alone.
      What does he want at his age?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child. It&rsquo;s not unnatural&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child!&rdquo; cried June scornfully. &ldquo;Of course! To leave
      his money to. If he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have
      one; then you can divorce him, and he can marry her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring June&mdash;her
      violent partizanship was fighting Soames&rsquo; battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be best for Irene to come quietly to us at Robin Hill, and
      see how things shape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said June; &ldquo;only....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked full at Jolyon&mdash;in all his many attempts afterwards to
      analyze that glance he never could succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I should only bring trouble on you all. I will go abroad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew from her voice that this was final. The irrelevant thought flashed
      through him: &lsquo;Well, I could see her there.&rsquo; But he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you would be more helpless abroad, in case he
      followed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can but try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June sprang up and paced the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all horrible,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;Why should people be tortured and kept miserable and
      helpless year after year by this disgusting sanctimonious law?&rdquo; But
      someone had come into the room, and June came to a standstill. Jolyon went
      up to Irene:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you like me to let your flat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jolyon, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall you be going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go back there in the meantime, will you?&rdquo;
      This he said with an anxiety strange to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve got all I want here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll send me your address?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand to him. &ldquo;I feel you&rsquo;re a rock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Built on sand,&rdquo; answered Jolyon, pressing her hand hard;
      &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a pleasure to do anything, at any time, remember
      that. And if you change your mind...! Come along, June; say good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June came from the window and flung her arms round Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of him,&rdquo; she said under her breath; &ldquo;enjoy
      yourself, and bless you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a memory of tears in Irene&rsquo;s eyes, and of a smile on her lips,
      they went away extremely silent, passing the lady who had interrupted the
      interview and was turning over the papers on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the National Gallery June exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all undignified beasts and horrible laws!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jolyon did not respond. He had something of his father&rsquo;s
      balance, and could see things impartially even when his emotions were
      roused. Irene was right; Soames&rsquo; position was as bad or worse than
      her own. As for the law&mdash;it catered for a human nature of which it
      took a naturally low view. And, feeling that if he stayed in his daughter&rsquo;s
      company he would in one way or another commit an indiscretion, he told her
      he must catch his train back to Oxford; and hailing a cab, left her to
      Turner&rsquo;s water-colours, with the promise that he would think over
      that Gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he thought over Irene instead. Pity, they said, was akin to love! If
      so he was certainly in danger of loving her, for he pitied her profoundly.
      To think of her drifting about Europe so handicapped and lonely! &lsquo;I
      hope to goodness she&rsquo;ll keep her head!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;she
      might easily grow desperate.&rsquo; In fact, now that she had cut loose
      from her poor threads of occupation, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine how she
      would go on&mdash;so beautiful a creature, hopeless, and fair game for
      anyone! In his exasperation was more than a little fear and jealousy.
      Women did strange things when they were driven into corners. &lsquo;I
      wonder what Soames will do now!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;A rotten,
      idiotic state of things! And I suppose they would say it was her own
      fault.&rsquo; Very preoccupied and sore at heart, he got into his train,
      mislaid his ticket, and on the platform at Oxford took his hat off to a
      lady whose face he seemed to remember without being able to put a name to
      her, not even when he saw her having tea at the Rainbow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;WHERE FORSYTES FEAR TO TREAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Quivering from the defeat of his hopes, with the green morocco case still
      flat against his heart, Soames revolved thoughts bitter as death. A spider&rsquo;s
      web! Walking fast, and noting nothing in the moonlight, he brooded over
      the scene he had been through, over the memory of her figure rigid in his
      grasp. And the more he brooded, the more certain he became that she had a
      lover&mdash;her words, &lsquo;I would sooner die!&rsquo; were ridiculous
      if she had not. Even if she had never loved him, she had made no fuss
      until Bosinney came on the scene. No; she was in love again, or she would
      not have made that melodramatic answer to his proposal, which in all the
      circumstances was reasonable! Very well! That simplified matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take steps to know where I am,&rsquo; he thought;
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Polteed&rsquo;s the first thing tomorrow morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in forming that resolution he knew he would have trouble with
      himself. He had employed Polteed&rsquo;s agency several times in the
      routine of his profession, even quite lately over Dartie&rsquo;s case, but
      he had never thought it possible to employ them to watch his own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too insulting to himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept over that project and his wounded pride&mdash;or rather, kept
      vigil. Only while shaving did he suddenly remember that she called herself
      by her maiden name of Heron. Polteed would not know, at first at all
      events, whose wife she was, would not look at him obsequiously and leer
      behind his back. She would just be the wife of one of his clients. And
      that would be true&mdash;for was he not his own solicitor?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was literally afraid not to put his design into execution at the first
      possible moment, lest, after all, he might fail himself. And making
      Warmson bring him an early cup of coffee; he stole out of the house before
      the hour of breakfast. He walked rapidly to one of those small West End
      streets where Polteed&rsquo;s and other firms ministered to the virtues of
      the wealthier classes. Hitherto he had always had Polteed to see him in
      the Poultry; but he well knew their address, and reached it at the opening
      hour. In the outer office, a room furnished so cosily that it might have
      been a money-lender&rsquo;s, he was attended by a lady who might have been
      a schoolmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Mr. Claud Polteed. He knows me&mdash;never mind my
      name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep everybody from knowing that he, Soames Forsyte, was reduced to
      having his wife spied on, was the overpowering consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Claud Polteed&mdash;so different from Mr. Lewis Polteed&mdash;was one
      of those men with dark hair, slightly curved noses, and quick brown eyes,
      who might be taken for Jews but are really Phoenicians; he received Soames
      in a room hushed by thickness of carpet and curtains. It was, in fact,
      confidentially furnished, without trace of document anywhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greeting Soames deferentially, he turned the key in the only door with a
      certain ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a client sends for me,&rdquo; he was in the habit of saying,
      &ldquo;he takes what precaution he likes. If he comes here, we convince
      him that we have no leakages. I may safely say we lead in security, if in
      nothing else....Now, sir, what can I do for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo; gorge had risen so that he could hardly speak. It was
      absolutely necessary to hide from this man that he had any but
      professional interest in the matter; and, mechanically, his face assumed
      its sideway smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to you early like this because there&rsquo;s not an
      hour to lose&rdquo;&mdash;if he lost an hour he might fail himself yet!
      &ldquo;Have you a really trustworthy woman free?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed unlocked a drawer, produced a memorandum, ran his eyes over
      it, and locked the drawer up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the very woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had seated himself and crossed his legs&mdash;nothing but a faint
      flush, which might have been his normal complexion, betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send her off at once, then, to watch a Mrs. Irene Heron of Flat C,
      Truro Mansions, Chelsea, till further notice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed; &ldquo;divorce, I presume?&rdquo;
      and he blew into a speaking-tube. &ldquo;Mrs. Blanch in? I shall want to
      speak to her in ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deal with any reports yourself,&rdquo; resumed Soames, &ldquo;and
      send them to me personally, marked confidential, sealed and registered. My
      client exacts the utmost secrecy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed smiled, as though saying, &lsquo;You are teaching your
      grandmother, my dear sir;&rsquo; and his eyes slid over Soames&rsquo; face
      for one unprofessional instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make his mind perfectly easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Understand me: Nothing may come of
      this. If a name gets out, or the watching is suspected, it may have very
      serious consequences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed nodded. &ldquo;I can put it into the cipher category. Under
      that system a name is never mentioned; we work by numbers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked another drawer and took out two slips of paper, wrote on them,
      and handed one to Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep that, sir; it&rsquo;s your key. I retain this duplicate. The
      case we&rsquo;ll call 7x. The party watched will be 17; the watcher 19;
      the Mansions 25; yourself&mdash;I should say, your firm&mdash;31; my firm
      32, myself 2. In case you should have to mention your client in writing I
      have called him 43; any person we suspect will be 47; a second person 51.
      Any special hint or instruction while we&rsquo;re about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;that is&mdash;every consideration
      compatible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Polteed nodded. &ldquo;Expense?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shrugged. &ldquo;In reason,&rdquo; he answered curtly, and got up.
      &ldquo;Keep it entirely in your own hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed, appearing suddenly between him
      and the door. &ldquo;I shall be seeing you in that other case before long.
      Good morning, sir.&rdquo; His eyes slid unprofessionally over Soames once
      more, and he unlocked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Soames, looking neither to right nor
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the street he swore deeply, quietly, to himself. A spider&rsquo;s
      web, and to cut it he must use this spidery, secret, unclean method, so
      utterly repugnant to one who regarded his private life as his most sacred
      piece of property. But the die was cast, he could not go back. And he went
      on into the Poultry, and locked away the green morocco case and the key to
      that cipher destined to make crystal-clear his domestic bankruptcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Odd that one whose life was spent in bringing to the public eye all the
      private coils of property, the domestic disagreements of others, should
      dread so utterly the public eye turned on his own; and yet not odd, for
      who should know so well as he the whole unfeeling process of legal
      regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked hard all day. Winifred was due at four o&rsquo;clock; he was to
      take her down to a conference in the Temple with Dreamer Q.C., and waiting
      for her he re-read the letter he had caused her to write the day of Dartie&rsquo;s
      departure, requiring him to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MONTAGUE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received your letter with the news that you have left me for
      ever and are on your way to Buenos Aires. It has naturally been a great
      shock. I am taking this earliest opportunity of writing to tell you that I
      am prepared to let bygones be bygones if you will return to me at once. I
      beg you to do so. I am very much upset, and will not say any more now. I
      am sending this letter registered to the address you left at your Club.
      Please cable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your still affectionate wife,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WINIFRED DARTIE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ugh! What bitter humbug! He remembered leaning over Winifred while she
      copied what he had pencilled, and how she had said, laying down her pen,
      &ldquo;Suppose he comes, Soames!&rdquo; in such a strange tone of voice,
      as if she did not know her own mind. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he
      had answered, &ldquo;till he&rsquo;s spent his money. That&rsquo;s why we
      must act at once.&rdquo; Annexed to the copy of that letter was the
      original of Dartie&rsquo;s drunken scrawl from the Iseeum Club. Soames
      could have wished it had not been so manifestly penned in liquor. Just the
      sort of thing the Court would pitch on. He seemed to hear the Judge&rsquo;s
      voice say: &ldquo;You took this seriously! Seriously enough to write him
      as you did? Do you think he meant it?&rdquo; Never mind! The fact was
      clear that Dartie had sailed and had not returned. Annexed also was his
      cabled answer: &ldquo;Impossible return. Dartie.&rdquo; Soames shook his
      head. If the whole thing were not disposed of within the next few months
      the fellow would turn up again like a bad penny. It saved a thousand a
      year at least to get rid of him, besides all the worry to Winifred and his
      father. &lsquo;I must stiffen Dreamer&rsquo;s back,&rsquo; he thought;
      &lsquo;we must push it on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, who had adopted a kind of half-mourning which became her fair
      hair and tall figure very well, arrived in James&rsquo; barouche drawn by
      James&rsquo; pair. Soames had not seen it in the City since his father
      retired from business five years ago, and its incongruity gave him a
      shock. &lsquo;Times are changing,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;one doesn&rsquo;t
      know what&rsquo;ll go next!&rsquo; Top hats even were scarcer. He enquired
      after Val. Val, said Winifred, wrote that he was going to play polo next
      term. She thought he was in a very good set. She added with fashionably
      disguised anxiety: &ldquo;Will there be much publicity about my affair,
      Soames? Must it be in the papers? It&rsquo;s so bad for him, and the
      girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With his own calamity all raw within him, Soames answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers are a pushing lot; it&rsquo;s very difficult to keep
      things out. They pretend to be guarding the public&rsquo;s morals, and
      they corrupt them with their beastly reports. But we haven&rsquo;t got to
      that yet. We&rsquo;re only seeing Dreamer to-day on the restitution
      question. Of course he understands that it&rsquo;s to lead to a divorce;
      but you must seem genuinely anxious to get Dartie back&mdash;you might
      practice that attitude to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What a clown Monty&rsquo;s been!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gave her a sharp look. It was clear to him that she could not take
      her Dartie seriously, and would go back on the whole thing if given half a
      chance. His own instinct had been firm in this matter from the first. To
      save a little scandal now would only bring on his sister and her children
      real disgrace and perhaps ruin later on if Dartie were allowed to hang on
      to them, going down-hill and spending the money James would leave his
      daughter. Though it was all tied up, that fellow would milk the
      settlements somehow, and make his family pay through the nose to keep him
      out of bankruptcy or even perhaps gaol! They left the shining carriage,
      with the shining horses and the shining-hatted servants on the Embankment,
      and walked up to Dreamer Q.C.&rsquo;. Chambers in Crown Office Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bellby is here, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;Mr. Dreamer
      will be ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bellby, the junior&mdash;not as junior as he might have been, for
      Soames only employed barristers of established reputation; it was, indeed,
      something of a mystery to him how barristers ever managed to establish
      that which made him employ them&mdash;Mr. Bellby was seated, taking a
      final glance through his papers. He had come from Court, and was in wig
      and gown, which suited a nose jutting out like the handle of a tiny pump,
      his small shrewd blue eyes, and rather protruding lower lip&mdash;no
      better man to supplement and stiffen Dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction to Winifred accomplished, they leaped the weather and
      spoke of the war. Soames interrupted suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t comply we can&rsquo;t bring proceedings for six
      months. I want to get on with the matter, Bellby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bellby, who had the ghost of an Irish brogue, smiled at Winifred and
      murmured: &ldquo;The Law&rsquo;s delays, Mrs. Dartie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six months!&rdquo; repeated Soames; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll drive it up
      to June! We shan&rsquo;t get the suit on till after the long vacation. We
      must put the screw on, Bellby&rdquo;&mdash;he would have all his work cut
      out to keep Winifred up to the scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dreamer will see you now, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They filed in, Mr. Bellby going first, and Soames escorting Winifred after
      an interval of one minute by his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreamer Q.C., in a gown but divested of wig, was standing before the fire,
      as if this conference were in the nature of a treat; he had the leathery,
      rather oily complexion which goes with great learning, a considerable nose
      with glasses perched on it, and little greyish whiskers; he luxuriated in
      the perpetual cocking of one eye, and the concealment of his lower with
      his upper lip, which gave a smothered turn to his speech. He had a way,
      too, of coming suddenly round the corner on the person he was talking to;
      this, with a disconcerting tone of voice, and a habit of growling before
      he began to speak&mdash;had secured a reputation second in Probate and
      Divorce to very few. Having listened, eye cocked, to Mr. Bellby&rsquo;s
      breezy recapitulation of the facts, he growled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that;&rdquo; and coming round the corner at Winifred,
      smothered the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to get him back, don&rsquo;t we, Mrs. Dartie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames interposed sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s position, of course, is intolerable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreamer growled. &ldquo;Exactly. Now, can we rely on the cabled refusal,
      or must we wait till after Christmas to give him a chance to have written&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the point, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner....&rdquo; Soames began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Bellby?&rdquo; said Dreamer, coming round his
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bellby seemed to sniff the air like a hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be on till the middle of December. We&rsquo;ve no
      need to give um more rope than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;why should my sister be incommoded
      by his choosing to go...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Jericho!&rdquo; said Dreamer, again coming round his corner;
      &ldquo;quite so. People oughtn&rsquo;t to go to Jericho, ought they, Mrs.
      Dartie?&rdquo; And he raised his gown into a sort of fantail. &ldquo;I
      agree. We can go forward. Is there anything more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present,&rdquo; said Soames meaningly; &ldquo;I wanted
      you to see my sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreamer growled softly: &ldquo;Delighted. Good evening!&rdquo; And let
      fall the protection of his gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      They filed out. Winifred went down the stairs. Soames lingered. In spite
      of himself he was impressed by Dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evidence is all right, I think,&rdquo; he said to Bellby.
      &ldquo;Between ourselves, if we don&rsquo;t get the thing through quick,
      we never may. D&rsquo;you think he understands that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make um,&rdquo; said Bellby. &ldquo;Good man though&mdash;good
      man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded and hastened after his sister. He found her in a draught,
      biting her lips behind her veil, and at once said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evidence of the stewardess will be very complete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&rsquo;s face hardened; she drew herself up, and they walked to
      the carriage. And, all through that silent drive back to Green Street, the
      souls of both of them revolved a single thought: &lsquo;Why, oh! why
      should I have to expose my misfortune to the public like this? Why have to
      employ spies to peer into my private troubles? They were not of my making.&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;JOLLY SITS IN JUDGMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The possessive instinct, which, so determinedly balked, was animating two
      members of the Forsyte family towards riddance of what they could no
      longer possess, was hardening daily in the British body politic. Nicholas,
      originally so doubtful concerning a war which must affect property, had
      been heard to say that these Boers were a pig-headed lot; they were
      causing a lot of expense, and the sooner they had their lesson the better.
      He would send out Wolseley! Seeing always a little further than other
      people&mdash;whence the most considerable fortune of all the Forsytes&mdash;he
      had perceived already that Buller was not the man&mdash;&rsquo;a bull of a
      chap, who just went butting, and if they didn&rsquo;t look out Ladysmith
      would fall.&rsquo; This was early in December, so that when Black Week
      came, he was enabled to say to everybody: &lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo;
      During that week of gloom such as no Forsyte could remember, very young
      Nicholas attended so many drills in his corps, &lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;s
      Own,&rsquo; that young Nicholas consulted the family physician about his
      son&rsquo;s health and was alarmed to find that he was perfectly sound.
      The boy had only just eaten his dinners and been called to the bar, at
      some expense, and it was in a way a nightmare to his father and mother
      that he should be playing with military efficiency at a time when military
      efficiency in the civilian population might conceivably be wanted. His
      grandfather, of course, pooh-poohed the notion, too thoroughly educated in
      the feeling that no British war could be other than little and
      professional, and profoundly distrustful of Imperial commitments, by
      which, moreover, he stood to lose, for he owned De Beers, now going down
      fast, more than a sufficient sacrifice on the part of his grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oxford, however, rather different sentiments prevailed. The inherent
      effervescence of conglomerate youth had, during the two months of the term
      before Black Week, been gradually crystallising out into vivid
      oppositions. Normal adolescence, ever in England of a conservative
      tendency though not taking things too seriously, was vehement for a fight
      to a finish and a good licking for the Boers. Of this larger faction Val
      Dartie was naturally a member. Radical youth, on the other hand, a small
      but perhaps more vocal body, was for stopping the war and giving the Boers
      autonomy. Until Black Week, however, the groups were amorphous, without
      sharp edges, and argument remained but academic. Jolly was one of those
      who knew not where he stood. A streak of his grandfather old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      love of justice prevented, him from seeing one side only. Moreover, in his
      set of &lsquo;the best&rsquo; there was a &lsquo;jumping-Jesus&rsquo; of
      extremely advanced opinions and some personal magnetism. Jolly wavered.
      His father, too, seemed doubtful in his views. And though, as was proper
      at the age of twenty, he kept a sharp eye on his father, watchful for
      defects which might still be remedied, still that father had an &lsquo;air&rsquo;
      which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic tolerance. Artists of
      course; were notoriously Hamlet-like, and to this extent one must discount
      for one&rsquo;s father, even if one loved him. But Jolyon&rsquo;s original
      view, that to &lsquo;put your nose in where you aren&rsquo;t wanted&rsquo;
      (as the Uitlanders had done) &lsquo;and then work the oracle till you get
      on top is not being quite the clean potato,&rsquo; had, whether founded in
      fact or no, a certain attraction for his son, who thought a deal about
      gentility. On the other hand Jolly could not abide such as his set called
      &lsquo;cranks,&rsquo; and Val&rsquo;s set called &lsquo;smugs,&rsquo; so
      that he was still balancing when the clock of Black Week struck. One&mdash;two&mdash;three,
      came those ominous repulses at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso. The
      sturdy English soul reacting after the first cried, &lsquo;Ah! but
      Methuen!&rsquo; after the second: &lsquo;Ah! but Buller!&rsquo; then, in
      inspissated gloom, hardened. And Jolly said to himself: &lsquo;No, damn
      it! We&rsquo;ve got to lick the beggars now; I don&rsquo;t care whether we&rsquo;re
      right or wrong.&rsquo; And, if he had known it, his father was thinking
      the same thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      That next Sunday, last of the term, Jolly was bidden to wine with &lsquo;one
      of the best.&rsquo; After the second toast, &lsquo;Buller and damnation to
      the Boers,&rsquo; drunk&mdash;no heel taps&mdash;in the college Burgundy,
      he noticed that Val Dartie, also a guest, was looking at him with a grin
      and saying something to his neighbour. He was sure it was disparaging. The
      last boy in the world to make himself conspicuous or cause public
      disturbance, Jolly grew rather red and shut his lips. The queer hostility
      he had always felt towards his second-cousin was strongly and suddenly
      reinforced. &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;you wait, my
      friend!&rsquo; More wine than was good for him, as the custom was, helped
      him to remember, when they all trooped forth to a secluded spot, to touch
      Val on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say about me in there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I say what I like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I said you were a pro-Boer&mdash;and so you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you want a row?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but not here; in the garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Come on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, eyeing each other askance, unsteady, and unflinching; they
      climbed the garden railings. The spikes on the top slightly ripped Val&rsquo;s
      sleeve, and occupied his mind. Jolly&rsquo;s mind was occupied by the
      thought that they were going to fight in the precincts of a college
      foreign to them both. It was not the thing, but never mind&mdash;the young
      beast!
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed over the grass into very nearly darkness, and took off their
      coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not screwed, are you?&rdquo; said Jolly suddenly.
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fight you if you&rsquo;re screwed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without shaking hands, they put themselves at once into postures of
      defence. They had drunk too much for science, and so were especially
      careful to assume correct attitudes, until Jolly smote Val almost
      accidentally on the nose. After that it was all a dark and ugly scrimmage
      in the deep shadow of the old trees, with no one to call &lsquo;time,&rsquo;
      till, battered and blown, they unclinched and staggered back from each
      other, as a voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your names, young gentlemen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this bland query spoken from under the lamp at the garden gate, like
      some demand of a god, their nerves gave way, and snatching up their coats,
      they ran at the railings, shinned up them, and made for the secluded spot
      whence they had issued to the fight. Here, in dim light, they mopped their
      faces, and without a word walked, ten paces apart, to the college gate.
      They went out silently, Val going towards the Broad along the Brewery,
      Jolly down the lane towards the High. His head, still fumed, was busy with
      regret that he had not displayed more science, passing in review the
      counters and knockout blows which he had not delivered. His mind strayed
      on to an imagined combat, infinitely unlike that which he had just been
      through, infinitely gallant, with sash and sword, with thrust and parry,
      as if he were in the pages of his beloved Dumas. He fancied himself La
      Mole, and Aramis, Bussy, Chicot, and D&rsquo;Artagnan rolled into one, but
      he quite failed to envisage Val as Coconnas, Brissac, or Rochefort. The
      fellow was just a confounded cousin who didn&rsquo;t come up to Cocker.
      Never mind! He had given him one or two. &lsquo;Pro-Boer!&rsquo; The word
      still rankled, and thoughts of enlisting jostled his aching head; of
      riding over the veldt, firing gallantly, while the Boers rolled over like
      rabbits. And, turning up his smarting eyes, he saw the stars shining
      between the housetops of the High, and himself lying out on the Karoo
      (whatever that was) rolled in a blanket, with his rifle ready and his gaze
      fixed on a glittering heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a fearful &lsquo;head&rsquo; next morning, which he doctored, as
      became one of &lsquo;the best,&rsquo; by soaking it in cold water, brewing
      strong coffee which he could not drink, and only sipping a little Hock at
      lunch. The legend that &lsquo;some fool&rsquo; had run into him round a
      corner accounted for a bruise on his cheek. He would on no account have
      mentioned the fight, for, on second thoughts, it fell far short of his
      standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he went &lsquo;down,&rsquo; and travelled through to Robin
      Hill. Nobody was there but June and Holly, for his father had gone to
      Paris. He spent a restless and unsettled Vacation, quite out of touch with
      either of his sisters. June, indeed, was occupied with lame ducks, whom,
      as a rule, Jolly could not stand, especially that Eric Cobbley and his
      family, &lsquo;hopeless outsiders,&rsquo; who were always littering up the
      house in the Vacation. And between Holly and himself there was a strange
      division, as if she were beginning to have opinions of her own, which was
      so&mdash;unnecessary. He punched viciously at a ball, rode furiously but
      alone in Richmond Park, making a point of jumping the stiff, high hurdles
      put up to close certain worn avenues of grass&mdash;keeping his nerve in,
      he called it. Jolly was more afraid of being afraid than most boys are. He
      bought a rifle, too, and put a range up in the home field, shooting across
      the pond into the kitchen-garden wall, to the peril of gardeners, with the
      thought that some day, perhaps, he would enlist and save South Africa for
      his country. In fact, now that they were appealing for Yeomanry recruits
      the boy was thoroughly upset. Ought he to go? None of &lsquo;the best,&rsquo;
      so far as he knew&mdash;and he was in correspondence with several&mdash;were
      thinking of joining. If they had been making a move he would have gone at
      once&mdash;very competitive, and with a strong sense of form, he could not
      bear to be left behind in anything&mdash;but to do it off his own bat
      might look like &lsquo;swagger&rsquo;. because of course it wasn&rsquo;t
      really necessary. Besides, he did not want to go, for the other side of
      this young Forsyte recoiled from leaping before he looked. It was
      altogether mixed pickles within him, hot and sickly pickles, and he became
      quite unlike his serene and rather lordly self.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then one day he saw that which moved him to uneasy wrath&mdash;two
      riders, in a glade of the Park close to the Ham Gate, of whom she on the
      left-hand was most assuredly Holly on her silver roan, and he on the
      right-hand as assuredly that &lsquo;squirt&rsquo; Val Dartie. His first
      impulse was to urge on his own horse and demand the meaning of this
      portent, tell the fellow to &lsquo;bunk,&rsquo; and take Holly home. His
      second&mdash;to feel that he would look a fool if they refused. He reined
      his horse in behind a tree, then perceived that it was equally impossible
      to spy on them. Nothing for it but to go home and await her coming!
      Sneaking out with that young bounder! He could not consult with June,
      because she had gone up that morning in the train of Eric Cobbley and his
      lot. And his father was still in &lsquo;that rotten Paris.&rsquo; He felt
      that this was emphatically one of those moments for which he had trained
      himself, assiduously, at school, where he and a boy called Brent had
      frequently set fire to newspapers and placed them in the centre of their
      studies to accustom them to coolness in moments of danger. He did not feel
      at all cool waiting in the stable-yard, idly stroking the dog Balthasar,
      who queasy as an old fat monk, and sad in the absence of his master,
      turned up his face, panting with gratitude for this attention. It was half
      an hour before Holly came, flushed and ever so much prettier than she had
      any right to look. He saw her look at him quickly&mdash;guiltily of course&mdash;then
      followed her in, and, taking her arm, conducted her into what had been
      their grandfather&rsquo;s study. The room, not much used now, was still
      vaguely haunted for them both by a presence with which they associated
      tenderness, large drooping white moustaches, the scent of cigar smoke, and
      laughter. Here Jolly, in the prime of his youth, before he went to school
      at all, had been wont to wrestle with his grandfather, who even at eighty
      had an irresistible habit of crooking his leg. Here Holly, perched on the
      arm of the great leather chair, had stroked hair curving silvery over an
      ear into which she would whisper secrets. Through that window they had all
      three sallied times without number to cricket on the lawn, and a
      mysterious game called &lsquo;Wopsy-doozle,&rsquo; not to be understood by
      outsiders, which made old Jolyon very hot. Here once on a warm night Holly
      had appeared in her &lsquo;nighty,&rsquo; having had a bad dream, to have
      the clutch of it released. And here Jolly, having begun the day badly by
      introducing fizzy magnesia into Mademoiselle Beauce&rsquo;s new-laid egg,
      and gone on to worse, had been sent down (in the absence of his father) to
      the ensuing dialogue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my boy, you mustn&rsquo;t go on like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she boxed my ears, Gran, so I only boxed hers, and then she
      boxed mine again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike a lady? That&rsquo;ll never do! Have you begged her pardon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must go and do it at once. Come along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she began it, Gran; and she had two to my one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it was an outrageous thing to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she lost her temper; and I didn&rsquo;t lose mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come too, then, Gran.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;this time only.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they had gone hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here&mdash;where the Waverley novels and Byron&rsquo;s works and Gibbon&rsquo;s
      Roman Empire and Humboldt&rsquo;s Cosmos, and the bronzes on the
      mantelpiece, and that masterpiece of the oily school, &lsquo;Dutch
      Fishing-Boats at Sunset,&rsquo; were fixed as fate, and for all sign of
      change old Jolyon might have been sitting there still, with legs crossed,
      in the arm chair, and domed forehead and deep eyes grave above The Times&mdash;here
      they came, those two grandchildren. And Jolly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you and that fellow in the Park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of blood rushing into her cheeks gave him some satisfaction; she
      ought to be ashamed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly was surprised; he had expected more, or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said weightily, &ldquo;that he called me a
      pro-Boer last term? And I had to fight him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly wished to answer: &lsquo;I should have,&rsquo; but it seemed beneath
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the meaning of it?
      Without telling anybody!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? Dad isn&rsquo;t here; why shouldn&rsquo;t I ride with
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me to ride with. I think he&rsquo;s an awful young
      rotter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly went pale with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s your own fault for not liking him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And slipping past her brother she went out, leaving him staring at the
      bronze Venus sitting on a tortoise, which had been shielded from him so
      far by his sister&rsquo;s dark head under her soft felt riding hat. He
      felt queerly disturbed, shaken to his young foundations. A lifelong
      domination lay shattered round his feet. He went up to the Venus and
      mechanically inspected the tortoise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why didn&rsquo;t he like Val Dartie? He could not tell. Ignorant of family
      history, barely aware of that vague feud which had started thirteen years
      before with Bosinney&rsquo;s defection from June in favour of Soames&rsquo;
      wife, knowing really almost nothing about Val he was at sea. He just did
      dislike him. The question, however, was: What should he do? Val Dartie, it
      was true, was a second-cousin, but it was not the thing for Holly to go
      about with him. And yet to &lsquo;tell&rsquo; of what he had chanced on
      was against his creed. In this dilemma he went and sat in the old leather
      chair and crossed his legs. It grew dark while he sat there staring out
      through the long window at the old oak-tree, ample yet bare of leaves,
      becoming slowly just a shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandfather!&rsquo; he thought without sequence, and took out his
      watch. He could not see the hands, but he set the repeater going. &lsquo;Five
      o&rsquo;clock!&rsquo; His grandfather&rsquo;s first gold hunter watch,
      butter-smooth with age&mdash;all the milling worn from it, and dented with
      the mark of many a fall. The chime was like a little voice from out of
      that golden age, when they first came from St. John&rsquo;s Wood, London,
      to this house&mdash;came driving with grandfather in his carriage, and
      almost instantly took to the trees. Trees to climb, and grandfather
      watering the geranium-beds below! What was to be done? Tell Dad he must
      come home? Confide in June?&mdash;only she was so&mdash;so sudden! Do
      nothing and trust to luck? After all, the Vac. would soon be over. Go up
      and see Val and warn him off? But how get his address? Holly wouldn&rsquo;t
      give it him! A maze of paths, a cloud of possibilities! He lit a
      cigarette. When he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed, almost
      as if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it; and in his ear
      something seemed to whisper: &lsquo;Do nothing; be nice to Holly, be nice
      to her, my dear!&rsquo; And Jolly heaved a sigh of contentment, blowing
      smoke through his nostrils....
    </p>
    <p>
      But up in her room, divested of her habit, Holly was still frowning.
      &lsquo;He is not&mdash;he is not!&rsquo; were the words which kept forming
      on her lips.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;JOLYON IN TWO MINDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little private hotel over a well-known restaurant near the Gare St.
      Lazare was Jolyon&rsquo;s haunt in Paris. He hated his fellow Forsytes
      abroad&mdash;vapid as fish out of water in their well-trodden runs, the
      Opera, Rue de Rivoli, and Moulin Rouge. Their air of having come because
      they wanted to be somewhere else as soon as possible annoyed him. But no
      other Forsyte came near this haunt, where he had a wood fire in his
      bedroom and the coffee was excellent. Paris was always to him more
      attractive in winter. The acrid savour from woodsmoke and
      chestnut-roasting braziers, the sharpness of the wintry sunshine on bright
      rays, the open cafes defying keen-aired winter, the self-contained brisk
      boulevard crowds, all informed him that in winter Paris possessed a soul
      which, like a migrant bird, in high summer flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke French well, had some friends, knew little places where pleasant
      dishes could be met with, queer types observed. He felt philosophic in
      Paris, the edge of irony sharpened; life took on a subtle, purposeless
      meaning, became a bunch of flavours tasted, a darkness shot with shifting
      gleams of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in the first week of December he decided to go to Paris, he was far
      from admitting that Irene&rsquo;s presence was influencing him. He had not
      been there two days before he owned that the wish to see her had been more
      than half the reason. In England one did not admit what was natural. He
      had thought it might be well to speak to her about the letting of her flat
      and other matters, but in Paris he at once knew better. There was a
      glamour over the city. On the third day he wrote to her, and received an
      answer which procured him a pleasurable shiver of the nerves:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR JOLYON,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a happiness for me to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IRENE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such as he had
      often had going to visit an adored picture. No woman, so far as he
      remembered, had ever inspired in him this special sensuous and yet
      impersonal sensation. He was going to sit and feast his eyes, and come
      away knowing her no better, but ready to go and feast his eyes again
      to-morrow. Such was his feeling, when in the tarnished and ornate little
      lounge of a quiet hotel near the river she came to him preceded by a small
      page-boy who uttered the word, &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; and vanished. Her
      face, her smile, the poise of her figure, were just as he had pictured,
      and the expression of her face said plainly: &lsquo;A friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what news, poor exile?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing from Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have let the flat for you, and like a good steward I bring you
      some money. How do you like Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he put her through this catechism, it seemed to him that he had
      never seen lips so fine and sensitive, the lower lip curving just a little
      upwards, the upper touched at one corner by the least conceivable dimple.
      It was like discovering a woman in what had hitherto been a sort of soft
      and breathed-on statue, almost impersonally admired. She owned that to be
      alone in Paris was a little difficult; and yet, Paris was so full of its
      own life that it was often, she confessed, as innocuous as a desert.
      Besides, the English were not liked just now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will hardly be your case,&rdquo; said Jolyon; &ldquo;you
      should appeal to the French.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has its disadvantages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must let me take you about while I&rsquo;m here. We&rsquo;ll
      start to-morrow. Come and dine at my pet restaurant; and we&rsquo;ll go to
      the Opera-Comique.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of daily meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon soon found that for those who desired a static condition of the
      affections, Paris was at once the first and last place in which to be
      friendly with a pretty woman. Revelation was alighting like a bird in his
      heart, singing: &lsquo;Elle est ton reve! Elle est ton reve! Sometimes
      this seemed natural, sometimes ludicrous&mdash;a bad case of elderly
      rapture. Having once been ostracised by Society, he had never since had
      any real regard for conventional morality; but the idea of a love which
      she could never return&mdash;and how could she at his age?&mdash;hardly
      mounted beyond his subconscious mind. He was full, too, of resentment, at
      the waste and loneliness of her life. Aware of being some comfort to her,
      and of the pleasure she clearly took in their many little outings, he was
      amiably desirous of doing and saying nothing to destroy that pleasure. It
      was like watching a starved plant draw up water, to see her drink in his
      companionship. So far as they could tell, no one knew her address except
      himself; she was unknown in Paris, and he but little known, so that
      discretion seemed unnecessary in those walks, talks, visits to concerts,
      picture-galleries, theatres, little dinners, expeditions to Versailles,
      St. Cloud, even Fontainebleau. And time fled&mdash;one of those full
      months without past to it or future. What in his youth would certainly
      have been headlong passion, was now perhaps as deep a feeling, but far
      gentler, tempered to protective companionship by admiration, hopelessness,
      and a sense of chivalry&mdash;arrested in his veins at least so long as
      she was there, smiling and happy in their friendship, and always to him
      more beautiful and spiritually responsive: for her philosophy of life
      seemed to march in admirable step with his own, conditioned by emotion
      more than by reason, ironically mistrustful, susceptible to beauty, almost
      passionately humane and tolerant, yet subject to instinctive rigidities of
      which as a mere man he was less capable. And during all this companionable
      month he never quite lost that feeling with which he had set out on the
      first day as if to visit an adored work of art, a well-nigh impersonal
      desire. The future&mdash;inexorable pendant to the present he took care
      not to face, for fear of breaking up his untroubled manner; but he made
      plans to renew this time in places still more delightful, where the sun
      was hot and there were strange things to see and paint. The end came
      swiftly on the 20th of January with a telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have enlisted in Imperial Yeomanry. JOLLY.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon received it just as he was setting out to meet her at the Louvre.
      It brought him up with a round turn. While he was lotus-eating here, his
      boy, whose philosopher and guide he ought to be, had taken this great step
      towards danger, hardship, perhaps even death. He felt disturbed to the
      soul, realising suddenly how Irene had twined herself round the roots of
      his being. Thus threatened with severance, the tie between them&mdash;for
      it had become a kind of tie&mdash;no longer had impersonal quality. The
      tranquil enjoyment of things in common, Jolyon perceived, was gone for
      ever. He saw his feeling as it was, in the nature of an infatuation.
      Ridiculous, perhaps, but so real that sooner or later it must disclose
      itself. And now, as it seemed to him, he could not, must not, make any
      such disclosure. The news of Jolly stood inexorably in the way. He was
      proud of this enlistment; proud of his boy for going off to fight for the
      country; for on Jolyon&rsquo;s pro-Boerism, too, Black Week had left its
      mark. And so the end was reached before the beginning! Well, luckily he
      had never made a sign!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came into the Gallery she was standing before the &lsquo;Virgin of
      the Rocks,&rsquo; graceful, absorbed, smiling and unconscious. &lsquo;Have
      I to give up seeing that?&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s unnatural,
      so long as she&rsquo;s willing that I should see her.&rsquo; He stood,
      unnoticed, watching her, storing up the image of her figure, envying the
      picture on which she was bending that long scrutiny. Twice she turned her
      head towards the entrance, and he thought: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for me!&rsquo;
      At last he went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the telegram, and he heard her sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sigh, too, was for him! His position was really cruel! To be loyal to
      his son he must just shake her hand and go. To be loyal to the feeling in
      his heart he must at least tell her what that feeling was. Could she,
      would she understand the silence in which he was gazing at that picture?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must go home at once,&rdquo; he said at last.
      &ldquo;I shall miss all this awfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So shall I; but, of course, you must go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Jolyon holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting her eyes, a flood of feeling nearly mastered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is life!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take care of yourself, my
      dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a stumbling sensation in his legs and feet, as if his brain refused
      to steer him away from her. From the doorway, he saw her lift her hand and
      touch its fingers with her lips. He raised his hat solemnly, and did not
      look back again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;DARTIE VERSUS DARTIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The suit&mdash;Dartie versus Dartie&mdash;for restitution of those
      conjugal rights concerning which Winifred was at heart so deeply
      undecided, followed the laws of subtraction towards day of judgment. This
      was not reached before the Courts rose for Christmas, but the case was
      third on the list when they sat again. Winifred spent the Christmas
      holidays a thought more fashionably than usual, with the matter locked up
      in her low-cut bosom. James was particularly liberal to her that
      Christmas, expressing thereby his sympathy, and relief, at the approaching
      dissolution of her marriage with that &lsquo;precious rascal,&rsquo; which
      his old heart felt but his old lips could not utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disappearance of Dartie made the fall in Consols a comparatively small
      matter; and as to the scandal&mdash;the real animus he felt against that
      fellow, and the increasing lead which property was attaining over
      reputation in a true Forsyte about to leave this world, served to drug a
      mind from which all allusions to the matter (except his own) were
      studiously kept. What worried him as a lawyer and a parent was the fear
      that Dartie might suddenly turn up and obey the Order of the Court when
      made. That would be a pretty how-de-do! The fear preyed on him in fact so
      much that, in presenting Winifred with a large Christmas cheque, he said:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s chiefly for that chap out there; to keep him from coming
      back.&rdquo; It was, of course, to pitch away good money, but all in the
      nature of insurance against that bankruptcy which would no longer hang
      over him if only the divorce went through; and he questioned Winifred
      rigorously until she could assure him that the money had been sent. Poor
      woman!&mdash;it cost her many a pang to send what must find its way into
      the vanity-bag of &lsquo;that creature!&rsquo; Soames, hearing of it,
      shook his head. They were not dealing with a Forsyte, reasonably tenacious
      of his purpose. It was very risky without knowing how the land lay out
      there. Still, it would look well with the Court; and he would see that
      Dreamer brought it out. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;where
      that ballet goes after the Argentine&rdquo;; never omitting a chance of
      reminder; for he knew that Winifred still had a weakness, if not for
      Dartie, at least for not laundering him in public. Though not good at
      showing admiration, he admitted that she was behaving extremely well, with
      all her children at home gaping like young birds for news of their father&mdash;Imogen
      just on the point of coming out, and Val very restive about the whole
      thing. He felt that Val was the real heart of the matter to Winifred, who
      certainly loved him beyond her other children. The boy could spoke the
      wheel of this divorce yet if he set his mind to it. And Soames was very
      careful to keep the proximity of the preliminary proceedings from his
      nephew&rsquo;s ears. He did more. He asked him to dine at the Remove, and
      over Val&rsquo;s cigar introduced the subject which he knew to be nearest
      to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you want to play polo up at
      Oxford.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val became less recumbent in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Soames, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a very expensive
      business. Your grandfather isn&rsquo;t likely to consent to it unless he
      can make sure that he&rsquo;s not got any other drain on him.&rdquo; And
      he paused to see whether the boy understood his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val&rsquo;s thick dark lashes concealed his eyes, but a slight grimace
      appeared on his wide mouth, and he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean my Dad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it depends on
      whether he continues to be a drag or not;&rdquo; and said no more, letting
      the boy dream it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Val was also dreaming in those days of a silver-roan palfrey and a
      girl riding it. Though Crum was in town and an introduction to Cynthia
      Dark to be had for the asking, Val did not ask; indeed, he shunned Crum
      and lived a life strange even to himself, except in so far as accounts
      with tailor and livery stable were concerned. To his mother, his sisters,
      his young brother, he seemed to spend this Vacation in &lsquo;seeing
      fellows,&rsquo; and his evenings sleepily at home. They could not propose
      anything in daylight that did not meet with the one response: &ldquo;Sorry;
      I&rsquo;ve got to see a fellow&rdquo;; and he was put to extraordinary
      shifts to get in and out of the house unobserved in riding clothes; until,
      being made a member of the Goat&rsquo;s Club, he was able to transport
      them there, where he could change unregarded and slip off on his hack to
      Richmond Park. He kept his growing sentiment religiously to himself. Not
      for a world would he breathe to the &lsquo;fellows,&rsquo; whom he was not
      &lsquo;seeing,&rsquo; anything so ridiculous from the point of view of
      their creed and his. But he could not help its destroying his other
      appetites. It was coming between him and the legitimate pleasures of youth
      at last on its own in a way which must, he knew, make him a milksop in the
      eyes of Crum. All he cared for was to dress in his last-created riding
      togs, and steal away to the Robin Hill Gate, where presently the silver
      roan would come demurely sidling with its slim and dark-haired rider, and
      in the glades bare of leaves they would go off side by side, not talking
      very much, riding races sometimes, and sometimes holding hands. More than
      once of an evening, in a moment of expansion, he had been tempted to tell
      his mother how this shy sweet cousin had stolen in upon him and wrecked
      his &lsquo;life.&rsquo; But bitter experience, that all persons above
      thirty-five were spoil-sports, prevented him. After all, he supposed he
      would have to go through with College, and she would have to &lsquo;come
      out,&rsquo; before they could be married; so why complicate things, so
      long as he could see her? Sisters were teasing and unsympathetic beings, a
      brother worse, so there was no one to confide in. Ah! And this beastly
      divorce business! What a misfortune to have a name which other people hadn&rsquo;t!
      If only he had been called Gordon or Scott or Howard or something fairly
      common! But Dartie&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t another in the directory! One
      might as well have been named Morkin for all the covert it afforded! So
      matters went on, till one day in the middle of January the silver-roan
      palfrey and its rider were missing at the tryst. Lingering in the cold, he
      debated whether he should ride on to the house: But Jolly might be there,
      and the memory of their dark encounter was still fresh within him. One
      could not be always fighting with her brother! So he returned dismally to
      town and spent an evening plunged in gloom. At breakfast next day he
      noticed that his mother had on an unfamiliar dress and was wearing her
      hat. The dress was black with a glimpse of peacock blue, the hat black and
      large&mdash;she looked exceptionally well. But when after breakfast she
      said to him, &ldquo;Come in here, Val,&rdquo; and led the way to the
      drawing-room, he was at once beset by qualms. Winifred carefully shut the
      door and passed her handkerchief over her lips; inhaling the violette de
      Parme with which it had been soaked, Val thought: &lsquo;Has she found out
      about Holly?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice interrupted
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be nice to me, dear boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val grinned doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me this morning....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see....&rdquo; began Val, but something in her
      face stopped him. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      mean....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have to go to the Court this morning.&rdquo; Already!&mdash;that
      d&mdash;-d business which he had almost succeeded in forgetting, since
      nobody ever mentioned it. In self-commiseration he stood picking little
      bits of skin off his fingers. Then noticing that his mother&rsquo;s lips
      were all awry, he said impulsively: &ldquo;All right, mother; I&rsquo;ll
      come. The brutes!&rdquo; What brutes he did not know, but the expression
      exactly summed up their joint feeling, and restored a measure of
      equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d better change into a &lsquo;shooter,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      he muttered, escaping to his room. He put on the &lsquo;shooter,&rsquo; a
      higher collar, a pearl pin, and his neatest grey spats, to a somewhat
      blasphemous accompaniment. Looking at himself in the glass, he said,
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m going to show anything!&rdquo;
      and went down. He found his grandfather&rsquo;s carriage at the door, and
      his mother in furs, with the appearance of one going to a Mansion House
      Assembly. They seated themselves side by side in the closed barouche, and
      all the way to the Courts of Justice Val made but one allusion to the
      business in hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be nothing about those pearls,
      will there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little tufted white tails of Winifred&rsquo;s muff began to shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be quite harmless
      to-day. Your grandmother wanted to come too, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her.
      I thought you could take care of me. You look so nice, Val. Just pull your
      coat collar up a little more at the back&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they bully you....&rdquo; began Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they won&rsquo;t. I shall be very cool. It&rsquo;s the only
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t want me to give evidence or anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; it&rsquo;s all arranged.&rdquo; And she patted his hand.
      The determined front she was putting on it stayed the turmoil in Val&rsquo;s
      chest, and he busied himself in drawing his gloves off and on. He had
      taken what he now saw was the wrong pair to go with his spats; they should
      have been grey, but were deerskin of a dark tan; whether to keep them on
      or not he could not decide. They arrived soon after ten. It was his first
      visit to the Law Courts, and the building struck him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said as they passed into the hall, &ldquo;this&rsquo;d
      make four or five jolly good racket courts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was awaiting them at the foot of some stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he said, without shaking hands, as if the
      event had made them too familiar for such formalities. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      Happerly Browne, Court I. We shall be on first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sensation such as he had known when going in to bat was playing now in
      the top of Val&rsquo;s chest, but he followed his mother and uncle
      doggedly, looking at no more than he could help, and thinking that the
      place smelled &lsquo;fuggy.&rsquo; People seemed to be lurking everywhere,
      and he plucked Soames by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Uncle, you&rsquo;re not going to let those beastly papers
      in, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gave him the sideway look which had reduced many to silence in its
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t take off your
      furs, Winifred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val entered behind them, nettled and with his head up. In this confounded
      hole everybody&mdash;and there were a good many of them&mdash;seemed
      sitting on everybody else&rsquo;s knee, though really divided from each
      other by pews; and Val had a feeling that they might all slip down
      together into the well. This, however, was but a momentary vision&mdash;of
      mahogany, and black gowns, and white blobs of wigs and faces and papers,
      all rather secret and whispery&mdash;before he was sitting next his mother
      in the front row, with his back to it all, glad of her violette de Parme,
      and taking off his gloves for the last time. His mother was looking at
      him; he was suddenly conscious that she had really wanted him there next
      to her, and that he counted for something in this business.
    </p>
    <p>
      All right! He would show them! Squaring his shoulders, he crossed his legs
      and gazed inscrutably at his spats. But just then an &lsquo;old Johnny&rsquo;
      in a gown and long wig, looking awfully like a funny raddled woman, came
      through a door into the high pew opposite, and he had to uncross his legs
      hastily, and stand up with everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dartie versus Dartie!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Val unspeakably disgusting to have one&rsquo;s name called
      out like this in public! And, suddenly conscious that someone nearly
      behind him had begun talking about his family, he screwed his face round
      to see an old be-wigged buffer, who spoke as if he were eating his own
      words&mdash;queer-looking old cuss, the sort of man he had seen once or
      twice dining at Park Lane and punishing the port; he knew now where they
      &lsquo;dug them up.&rsquo; All the same he found the old buffer quite
      fascinating, and would have continued to stare if his mother had not
      touched his arm. Reduced to gazing before him, he fixed his eyes on the
      Judge&rsquo;s face instead. Why should that old &lsquo;sportsman&rsquo;
      with his sarcastic mouth and his quick-moving eyes have the power to
      meddle with their private affairs&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t he affairs of his
      own, just as many, and probably just as nasty? And there moved in Val,
      like an illness, all the deep-seated individualism of his breed. The voice
      behind him droned along: &ldquo;Differences about money matters&mdash;extravagance
      of the respondent&rdquo; (What a word! Was that his father?)&mdash;&ldquo;strained
      situation&mdash;frequent absences on the part of Mr. Dartie. My client,
      very rightly, your Ludship will agree, was anxious to check a course&mdash;but
      lead to ruin&mdash;remonstrated&mdash;gambling at cards and on the
      racecourse&mdash;&rdquo; (&rsquo;.hat&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; thought Val,
      &lsquo;pile it on!&rsquo;. &ldquo;Crisis early in October, when the
      respondent wrote her this letter from his Club.&rdquo; Val sat up and his
      ears burned. &ldquo;I propose to read it with the emendations necessary to
      the epistle of a gentleman who has been&mdash;shall we say dining, me Lud?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old brute!&rsquo; thought Val, flushing deeper; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      not paid to make jokes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You will not get the chance to insult me again in my own
      house. I am leaving the country to-morrow. It&rsquo;s played out&rsquo;&mdash;an
      expression, your Ludship, not unknown in the mouths of those who have not
      met with conspicuous success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sniggering owls!&rsquo; thought Val, and his flush deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am tired of being insulted by you.&rsquo; My client will
      tell your Ludship that these so-called insults consisted in her calling
      him &lsquo;the limit&rsquo;,&mdash;a very mild expression, I venture to
      suggest, in all the circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val glanced sideways at his mother&rsquo;s impassive face, it had a hunted
      look in the eyes. &lsquo;Poor mother,&rsquo; he thought, and touched her
      arm with his own. The voice behind droned on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am going to live a new life. M. D.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next day, me Lud, the respondent left by the steamship
      Tuscarora for Buenos Aires. Since then we have nothing from him but a
      cabled refusal in answer to the letter which my client wrote the following
      day in great distress, begging him to return to her. With your Ludship&rsquo;s
      permission. I shall now put Mrs. Dartie in the box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When his mother rose, Val had a tremendous impulse to rise too and say:
      &lsquo;Look here! I&rsquo;m going to see you jolly well treat her
      decently.&rsquo; He subdued it, however; heard her saying, &lsquo;the
      truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,&rsquo; and looked up.
      She made a rich figure of it, in her furs and large hat, with a slight
      flush on her cheek-bones, calm, matter-of-fact; and he felt proud of her
      thus confronting all these &lsquo;confounded lawyers.&rsquo; The
      examination began. Knowing that this was only the preliminary to divorce,
      Val followed with a certain glee the questions framed so as to give the
      impression that she really wanted his father back. It seemed to him that
      they were &lsquo;foxing Old Bagwigs finely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he received a most unpleasant jar when the Judge said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why did your husband leave you&mdash;not because you called
      him &lsquo;the limit,&rsquo; you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val saw his uncle lift his eyes to the witness box, without moving his
      face; heard a shuffle of papers behind him; and instinct told him that the
      issue was in peril. Had Uncle Soames and the old buffer behind made a mess
      of it? His mother was speaking with a slight drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord, but it had gone on a long time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had gone on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our differences about money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you supplied the money. Do you suggest that he left you to
      better his position?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The brute! The old brute, and nothing but the brute!&rsquo; thought
      Val suddenly. &lsquo;He smells a rat he&rsquo;s trying to get at the
      pastry!&rsquo; And his heart stood still. If&mdash;if he did, then, of
      course, he would know that his mother didn&rsquo;t really want his father
      back. His mother spoke again, a thought more fashionably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord, but you see I had refused to give him any more money.
      It took him a long time to believe that, but he did at last&mdash;and when
      he did....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, you had refused. But you&rsquo;ve sent him some since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, I wanted him back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you thought that would bring him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my Lord, I acted on my father&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the Judge&rsquo;s face, in the sound of the papers behind
      him, in the sudden crossing of his uncle&rsquo;s legs, told Val that she
      had made just the right answer. &lsquo;Crafty!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;by
      Jove, what humbug it all is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge was speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one more question, Mrs. Dartie. Are you still fond of your
      husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val&rsquo;s hands, slack behind him, became fists. What business had that
      Judge to make things human suddenly? To make his mother speak out of her
      heart, and say what, perhaps, she didn&rsquo;t know herself, before all
      these people! It wasn&rsquo;t decent. His mother answered, rather low:
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo; Val saw the Judge nod. &lsquo;Wish I could
      take a cock-shy at your head!&rsquo; he thought irreverently, as his
      mother came back to her seat beside him. Witnesses to his father&rsquo;s
      departure and continued absence followed&mdash;one of their own maids
      even, which struck Val as particularly beastly; there was more talking,
      all humbug; and then the Judge pronounced the decree for restitution, and
      they got up to go. Val walked out behind his mother, chin squared, eyelids
      drooped, doing his level best to despise everybody. His mother&rsquo;s
      voice in the corridor roused him from an angry trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behaved beautifully, dear. It was such a comfort to have you.
      Your uncle and I are going to lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Val; &ldquo;I shall have time to go and see
      that fellow.&rdquo; And, parting from them abruptly, he ran down the
      stairs and out into the air. He bolted into a hansom, and drove to the
      Goat&rsquo;s Club. His thoughts were on Holly and what he must do before
      her brother showed her this thing in to-morrow&rsquo;s paper.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When Val had left them Soames and Winifred made their way to the Cheshire
      Cheese. He had suggested it as a meeting place with Mr. Bellby. At that
      early hour of noon they would have it to themselves, and Winifred had
      thought it would be &lsquo;amusing&rsquo; to see this far-famed hostelry.
      Having ordered a light repast, to the consternation of the waiter, they
      awaited its arrival together with that of Mr. Bellby, in silent reaction
      after the hour and a half&rsquo;s suspense on the tenterhooks of
      publicity. Mr. Bellby entered presently, preceded by his nose, as cheerful
      as they were glum. Well! they had got the decree of restitution, and what
      was the matter with that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Soames in a suitably low voice, &ldquo;but we
      shall have to begin again to get evidence. He&rsquo;ll probably try the
      divorce&mdash;it will look fishy if it comes out that we knew of
      misconduct from the start. His questions showed well enough that he doesn&rsquo;t
      like this restitution dodge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho!&rdquo; said Mr. Bellby cheerily, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll forget!
      Why, man, he&rsquo;ll have tried a hundred cases between now and then.
      Besides, he&rsquo;s bound by precedent to give ye your divorce, if the
      evidence is satisfactory. We won&rsquo;t let um know that Mrs. Dartie had
      knowledge of the facts. Dreamer did it very nicely&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a
      fatherly touch about um!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I compliment ye, Mrs. Dartie,&rdquo; went on Mr. Bellby;
      &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve a natural gift for giving evidence. Steady as a rock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the waiter arrived with three plates balanced on one arm, and the
      remark: &ldquo;I &lsquo;urried up the pudden, sir. You&rsquo;ll find
      plenty o&rsquo; lark in it to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bellby applauded his forethought with a dip of his nose. But Soames
      and Winifred looked with dismay at their light lunch of gravified brown
      masses, touching them gingerly with their forks in the hope of
      distinguishing the bodies of the tasty little song-givers. Having begun,
      however, they found they were hungrier than they thought, and finished the
      lot, with a glass of port apiece. Conversation turned on the war. Soames
      thought Ladysmith would fall, and it might last a year. Bellby thought it
      would be over by the summer. Both agreed that they wanted more men. There
      was nothing for it but complete victory, since it was now a question of
      prestige. Winifred brought things back to more solid ground by saying that
      she did not want the divorce suit to come on till after the summer
      holidays had begun at Oxford, then the boys would have forgotten about it
      before Val had to go up again; the London season too would be over. The
      lawyers reassured her, an interval of six months was necessary&mdash;after
      that the earlier the better. People were now beginning to come in, and
      they parted&mdash;Soames to the city, Bellby to his chambers, Winifred in
      a hansom to Park Lane to let her mother know how she had fared. The issue
      had been so satisfactory on the whole that it was considered advisable to
      tell James, who never failed to say day after day that he didn&rsquo;t
      know about Winifred&rsquo;s affair, he couldn&rsquo;t tell. As his sands
      ran out; the importance of mundane matters became increasingly grave to
      him, as if he were feeling: &lsquo;I must make the most of it, and worry
      well; I shall soon have nothing to worry about.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He received the report grudgingly. It was a new-fangled way of going about
      things, and he didn&rsquo;t know! But he gave Winifred a cheque, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll have a lot of expense. That&rsquo;s a new hat
      you&rsquo;ve got on. Why doesn&rsquo;t Val come and see us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred promised to bring him to dinner soon. And, going home, she sought
      her bedroom where she could be alone. Now that her husband had been
      ordered back into her custody with a view to putting him away from her for
      ever, she would try once more to find out from her sore and lonely heart
      what she really wanted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE CHALLENGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning had been misty, verging on frost, but the sun came out while
      Val was jogging towards the Roehampton Gate, whence he would canter on to
      the usual tryst. His spirits were rising rapidly. There had been nothing
      so very terrible in the morning&rsquo;s proceedings beyond the general
      disgrace of violated privacy. &lsquo;If we were engaged!&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;what happens wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; He felt,
      indeed, like human society, which kicks and clamours at the results of
      matrimony, and hastens to get married. And he galloped over the
      winter-dried grass of Richmond Park, fearing to be late. But again he was
      alone at the trysting spot, and this second defection on the part of Holly
      upset him dreadfully. He could not go back without seeing her to-day!
      Emerging from the Park, he proceeded towards Robin Hill. He could not make
      up his mind for whom to ask. Suppose her father were back, or her sister
      or brother were in! He decided to gamble, and ask for them all first, so
      that if he were in luck and they were not there, it would be quite natural
      in the end to ask for Holly; while if any of them were in&mdash;an &lsquo;excuse
      for a ride&rsquo; must be his saving grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Miss Holly is in, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thanks. Might I take my horse round to the stables? And would
      you say&mdash;her cousin, Mr. Val Dartie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned she was in the hall, very flushed and shy. She led him to
      the far end, and they sat down on a wide window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awfully anxious,&rdquo; said Val in a low voice.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly knows about our riding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I expect he will be soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then!&rdquo; cried Val, and diving forward, he seized her hand. She
      tried to withdraw it, failed, gave up the attempt, and looked at him
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to tell you something
      about my family. My Dad, you know, isn&rsquo;t altogether&mdash;I mean, he&rsquo;s
      left my mother and they&rsquo;re trying to divorce him; so they&rsquo;ve
      ordered him to come back, you see. You&rsquo;ll see that in the paper
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes deepened in colour and fearful interest; her hand squeezed his.
      But the gambler in Val was roused now, and he hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s nothing very much at present, but there
      will be, I expect, before it&rsquo;s over; divorce suits are beastly, you
      know. I wanted to tell you, because&mdash;because&mdash;you ought to know&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
      and he began to stammer, gazing at her troubled eyes, &ldquo;if&mdash;if
      you&rsquo;re going to be a darling and love me, Holly. I love you&mdash;ever
      so; and I want to be engaged.&rdquo; He had done it in a manner so
      inadequate that he could have punched his own head; and dropping on his
      knees, he tried to get nearer to that soft, troubled face. &ldquo;You do
      love me&mdash;don&rsquo;t you? If you don&rsquo;t I....&rdquo; There was a
      moment of silence and suspense, so awful that he could hear the sound of a
      mowing-machine far out on the lawn pretending there was grass to cut. Then
      she swayed forward; her free hand touched his hair, and he gasped: &ldquo;Oh,
      Holly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was very soft: &ldquo;Oh, Val!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dreamed of this moment, but always in an imperative mood, as the
      masterful young lover, and now he felt humble, touched, trembly. He was
      afraid to stir off his knees lest he should break the spell; lest, if he
      did, she should shrink and deny her own surrender&mdash;so tremulous was
      she in his grasp, with her eyelids closed and his lips nearing them. Her
      eyes opened, seemed to swim a little; he pressed his lips to hers.
      Suddenly he sprang up; there had been footsteps, a sort of startled grunt.
      He looked round. No one! But the long curtains which barred off the outer
      hall were quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Who was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly too was on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly, I expect,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val clenched fists and resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a bit now we&rsquo;re
      engaged,&rdquo; and striding towards the curtains, he drew them aside.
      There at the fireplace in the hall stood Jolly, with his back elaborately
      turned. Val went forward. Jolly faced round on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon for hearing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the best intentions in the world, Val could not help admiring him at
      that moment; his face was clear, his voice quiet, he looked somehow
      distinguished, as if acting up to principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Val said abruptly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jolly; &ldquo;you come this way,&rdquo; and he
      crossed the hall. Val followed. At the study door he felt a touch on his
      arm; Holly&rsquo;s voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly opened the door, and they all three went in. Once in the little
      room, they stood in a sort of triangle on three corners of the worn Turkey
      carpet; awkwardly upright, not looking at each other, quite incapable of
      seeing any humour in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holly and I are engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly stepped back and leaned against the lintel of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
      insult you in it. But my father&rsquo;s away. I&rsquo;m in charge of my
      sister. You&rsquo;ve taken advantage of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; said Val hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you did,&rdquo; said Jolly. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t
      meant to, you&rsquo;d have spoken to me, or waited for my father to come
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were reasons,&rdquo; said Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my family&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just told her. I wanted her to
      know before things happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly suddenly became less distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kids,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you know you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a kid,&rdquo; said Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;you&rsquo;re not twenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty,&rdquo; said Jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just; anyway, I&rsquo;m as good a man as you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly&rsquo;s face crimsoned, then clouded. Some struggle was evidently
      taking place in him; and Val and Holly stared at him, so clearly was that
      struggle marked; they could even hear him breathing. Then his face cleared
      up and became oddly resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dare you to do what
      I&rsquo;m going to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly smiled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dare you; and I know very
      well you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A stab of misgiving shot through Val; this was riding very blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that you&rsquo;re a fire-eater,&rdquo;
      said Jolly slowly, &ldquo;and I think that&rsquo;s about all you are; or
      that you called me a pro-Boer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val heard a gasp above the sound of his own hard breathing, and saw Holly&rsquo;s
      face poked a little forward, very pale, with big eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Jolly with a sort of smile, &ldquo;we shall
      soon see. I&rsquo;m going to join the Imperial Yeomanry, and I dare you to
      do the same, Mr. Val Dartie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val&rsquo;s head jerked on its stem. It was like a blow between the eyes,
      so utterly unthought of, so extreme and ugly in the midst of his dreaming;
      and he looked at Holly with eyes grown suddenly, touchingly haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; said Jolly. &ldquo;Take your time! Think it over
      well.&rdquo; And he himself sat down on the arm of his grandfather&rsquo;s
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val did not sit down; he stood with hands thrust deep into his breeches&rsquo;
      pockets-hands clenched and quivering. The full awfulness of this decision
      one way or the other knocked at his mind with double knocks as of an angry
      postman. If he did not take that &lsquo;dare&rsquo; he was disgraced in
      Holly&rsquo;s eyes, and in the eyes of that young enemy, her brute of a
      brother. Yet if he took it, ah! then all would vanish&mdash;her face, her
      eyes, her hair, her kisses just begun!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said Jolly again; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to be unfair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they both looked at Holly. She had recoiled against the bookshelves
      reaching to the ceiling; her dark head leaned against Gibbon&rsquo;s Roman
      Empire, her eyes in a sort of soft grey agony were fixed on Val. And he,
      who had not much gift of insight, had suddenly a gleam of vision. She
      would be proud of her brother&mdash;that enemy! She would be ashamed of
      him! His hands came out of his pockets as if lifted by a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly&rsquo;s face&mdash;oh! it was queer! He saw her flush, start
      forward. He had done the right thing&mdash;her face was shining with
      wistful admiration. Jolly stood up and made a little bow as who should
      say: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve passed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering from the impetus which had carried him to that decision, Val
      looked at him maliciously from under his lashes. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo;
      he thought, &lsquo;one to you. I shall have to join&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll
      get back on you somehow.&rsquo; And he said with dignity: &ldquo;I shall
      be ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet at the main Recruiting Office, then,&rdquo; said
      Jolly, &ldquo;at twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; And, opening the window, he
      went out on to the terrace, conforming to the creed which had made him
      retire when he surprised them in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confusion in the mind of Val thus left alone with her for whom he had
      paid this sudden price was extreme. The mood of &lsquo;showing-off&rsquo;
      was still, however, uppermost. One must do the wretched thing with an air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall get plenty of riding and shooting, anyway,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo; And it gave him a sort of grim
      pleasure to hear the sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the war&rsquo;ll soon be over,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;perhaps
      we shan&rsquo;t even have to go out. I don&rsquo;t care, except for you.&rdquo;
      He would be out of the way of that beastly divorce. It was an ill-wind! He
      felt her warm hand slip into his. Jolly thought he had stopped their
      loving each other, did he? He held her tightly round the waist, looking at
      her softly through his lashes, smiling to cheer her up, promising to come
      down and see her soon, feeling somehow six inches taller and much more in
      command of her than he had ever dared feel before. Many times he kissed
      her before he mounted and rode back to town. So, swiftly, on the least
      provocation, does the possessive instinct flourish and grow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;DINNER AT JAMES&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dinner parties were not now given at James&rsquo; in Park Lane&mdash;to
      every house the moment comes when Master or Mistress is no longer &lsquo;up
      to it&rsquo;. no more can nine courses be served to twenty mouths above
      twenty fine white expanses; nor does the household cat any longer wonder
      why she is suddenly shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with something like excitement Emily&mdash;who at seventy would still
      have liked a little feast and fashion now and then&mdash;ordered dinner
      for six instead of two, herself wrote a number of foreign words on cards,
      and arranged the flowers&mdash;mimosa from the Riviera, and white Roman
      hyacinths not from Rome. There would only be, of course, James and
      herself, Soames, Winifred, Val, and Imogen&mdash;but she liked to pretend
      a little and dally in imagination with the glory of the past. She so
      dressed herself that James remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you putting on that thing for? You&rsquo;ll catch cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Emily knew that the necks of women are protected by love of shining,
      unto fourscore years, and she only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me put you on one of those dickies I got you, James; then you&rsquo;ll
      only have to change your trousers, and put on your velvet coat, and there
      you&rsquo;ll be. Val likes you to look nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dicky!&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always wasting your
      money on something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he suffered the change to be made till his neck also shone, murmuring
      vaguely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an extravagant chap, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little brighter in the eye, with rather more colour than usual in his
      cheeks, he took his seat in the drawing-room to wait for the sound of the
      front-door bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made it a proper dinner party,&rdquo; Emily said
      comfortably; &ldquo;I thought it would be good practice for Imogen&mdash;she
      must get used to it now she&rsquo;s coming out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James uttered an indeterminate sound, thinking of Imogen as she used to
      climb about his knee or pull Christmas crackers with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be pretty,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is pretty,&rdquo; said Emily; &ldquo;she ought to make a good
      match.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; murmured James; &ldquo;she&rsquo;d much better
      stay at home and look after her mother.&rdquo; A second Dartie carrying
      off his pretty granddaughter would finish him! He had never quite forgiven
      Emily for having been as much taken in by Montague Dartie as he himself
      had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Warmson?&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;I should
      like a glass of Madeira to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s champagne, James.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James shook his head. &ldquo;No body,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      get any good out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily reached forward on her side of the fire and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master would like a bottle of Madeira opened, Warmson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said James, the tips of his ears quivering with
      vehemence, and his eyes fixed on an object seen by him alone. &ldquo;Look
      here, Warmson, you go to the inner cellar, and on the middle shelf of the
      end bin on the left you&rsquo;ll see seven bottles; take the one in the
      centre, and don&rsquo;t shake it. It&rsquo;s the last of the Madeira I had
      from Mr. Jolyon when we came in here&mdash;never been moved; it ought to
      be in prime condition still; but I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; responded the withdrawing Warmson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was keeping it for our golden wedding,&rdquo; said James
      suddenly, &ldquo;but I shan&rsquo;t live three years at my age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, James,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk like
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have got it up myself,&rdquo; murmured James, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
      shake it as likely as not.&rdquo; And he sank into silent recollection of
      long moments among the open gas-jets, the cobwebs and the good smell of
      wine-soaked corks, which had been appetiser to so many feasts. In the wine
      from that cellar was written the history of the forty odd years since he
      had come to the Park Lane house with his young bride, and of the many
      generations of friends and acquaintances who had passed into the unknown;
      its depleted bins preserved the record of family festivity&mdash;all the
      marriages, births, deaths of his kith and kin. And when he was gone there
      it would be, and he didn&rsquo;t know what would become of it. It&rsquo;d
      be drunk or spoiled, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      From that deep reverie the entrance of his son dragged him, followed very
      soon by that of Winifred and her two eldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down arm-in-arm&mdash;James with Imogen, the debutante, because
      his pretty grandchild cheered him; Soames with Winifred; Emily with Val,
      whose eyes lighting on the oysters brightened. This was to be a proper
      full &lsquo;blowout&rsquo; with &lsquo;fizz&rsquo; and port! And he felt
      in need of it, after what he had done that day, as yet undivulged. After
      the first glass or two it became pleasant to have this bombshell up his
      sleeve, this piece of sensational patriotism, or example, rather, of
      personal daring, to display&mdash;for his pleasure in what he had done for
      his Queen and Country was so far entirely personal. He was now a &lsquo;blood,&rsquo;
      indissolubly connected with guns and horses; he had a right to swagger&mdash;not,
      of course, that he was going to. He should just announce it quietly, when
      there was a pause. And, glancing down the menu, he determined on &lsquo;Bombe
      aux fraises&rsquo; as the proper moment; there would be a certain
      solemnity while they were eating that. Once or twice before they reached
      that rosy summit of the dinner he was attacked by remembrance that his
      grandfather was never told anything! Still, the old boy was drinking
      Madeira, and looking jolly fit! Besides, he ought to be pleased at this
      set-off to the disgrace of the divorce. The sight of his uncle opposite,
      too, was a sharp incentive. He was so far from being a sportsman that it
      would be worth a lot to see his face. Besides, better to tell his mother
      in this way than privately, which might upset them both! He was sorry for
      her, but after all one couldn&rsquo;t be expected to feel much for others
      when one had to part from Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather&rsquo;s voice travelled to him thinly. &ldquo;Val, try a
      little of the Madeira with your ice. You won&rsquo;t get that up at
      college.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val watched the slow liquid filling his glass, the essential oil of the
      old wine glazing the surface; inhaled its aroma, and thought: &lsquo;Now
      for it!&rsquo; It was a rich moment. He sipped, and a gentle glow spread
      in his veins, already heated. With a rapid look round, he said, &ldquo;I
      joined the Imperial Yeomanry to-day, Granny,&rdquo; and emptied his glass
      as though drinking the health of his own act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; It was his mother&rsquo;s desolate little word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Jolly Forsyte and I went down there together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sign?&rdquo; from Uncle Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather! We go into camp on Monday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; cried Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All looked at James. He was leaning forward with his hand behind his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he saying? I
      can&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily reached forward to pat Val&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that Val has joined the Yeomanry, James; it&rsquo;s
      very nice for him. He&rsquo;ll look his best in uniform.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joined the&mdash;rubbish!&rdquo; came from James, tremulously loud.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see two yards before your nose. He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      have to go out there. Why! he&rsquo;ll be fighting before he knows where
      he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Val saw Imogen&rsquo;s eyes admiring him, and his mother still and
      fashionable with her handkerchief before her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his uncle spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re under age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; smiled Val; &ldquo;I gave my age as
      twenty-one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his grandmother&rsquo;s admiring, &ldquo;Well, Val, that was
      plucky of you;&rdquo; was conscious of Warmson deferentially filling his
      champagne glass; and of his grandfather&rsquo;s voice moaning: &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll become of you if you go on like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen was patting his shoulder, his uncle looking at him sidelong; only
      his mother sat unmoving, till, affected by her stillness, Val said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, you know; we shall soon have them on the run.
      I only hope I shall come in for something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt elated, sorry, tremendously important all at once. This would show
      Uncle Soames, and all the Forsytes, how to be sportsmen. He had certainly
      done something heroic and exceptional in giving his age as twenty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily&rsquo;s voice brought him back to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t have a second glass, James. Warmson!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be astonished at Timothy&rsquo;s!&rdquo; burst out
      Imogen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to see their faces. Do you have a
      sword, Val, or only a popgun?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle&rsquo;s voice produced a slight chill in the pit of Val&rsquo;s
      stomach. Made him? How answer that? He was grateful for his grandmother&rsquo;s
      comfortable:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s very plucky of Val. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
      make a splendid soldier; he&rsquo;s just the figure for it. We shall all
      be proud of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had young Jolly Forsyte to do with it? Why did you go
      together?&rdquo; pursued Soames, uncannily relentless. &ldquo;I thought
      you weren&rsquo;t friendly with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; mumbled Val, &ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t going
      to be beaten by him.&rdquo; He saw his uncle look at him quite
      differently, as if approving. His grandfather was nodding too, his
      grandmother tossing her head. They all approved of his not being beaten by
      that cousin of his. There must be a reason! Val was dimly conscious of
      some disturbing point outside his range of vision; as it might be, the
      unlocated centre of a cyclone. And, staring at his uncle&rsquo;s face, he
      had a quite unaccountable vision of a woman with dark eyes, gold hair, and
      a white neck, who smelt nice, and had pretty silken clothes which he had
      liked feeling when he was quite small. By Jove, yes! Aunt Irene! She used
      to kiss him, and he had bitten her arm once, playfully, because he liked
      it&mdash;so soft. His grandfather was speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his father doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s away in Paris,&rdquo; Val said, staring at the very
      queer expression on his uncle&rsquo;s face, like&mdash;like that of a
      snarling dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artists!&rdquo; said James. The word coming from the very bottom of
      his soul, broke up the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite his mother in the cab going home, Val tasted the after-fruits of
      heroism, like medlars over-ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only said, indeed, that he must go to his tailor&rsquo;s at once and
      have his uniform properly made, and not just put up with what they gave
      him. But he could feel that she was very much upset. It was on his lips to
      console her with the spoken thought that he would be out of the way of
      that beastly divorce, but the presence of Imogen, and the knowledge that
      his mother would not be out of the way, restrained him. He felt aggrieved
      that she did not seem more proud of him. When Imogen had gone to bed, he
      risked the emotional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to have to leave you, Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must make the best of it. We must try and get you a
      commission as soon as we can; then you won&rsquo;t have to rough it so. Do
      you know any drill, Val?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scrap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t worry you much. I must take you about to
      get the things to-morrow. Good-night; kiss me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that kiss, soft and hot, between his eyes, and those words, &lsquo;I
      hope they won&rsquo;t worry you much,&rsquo; in his ears, he sat down to a
      cigarette, before a dying fire. The heat was out of him&mdash;the glow of
      cutting a dash. It was all a damned heart-aching bore. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be even with that chap Jolly,&rsquo; he thought, trailing up the stairs,
      past the room where his mother was biting her pillow to smother a sense of
      desolation which was trying to make her sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon only one of the diners at James&rsquo; was awake&mdash;Soames, in
      his bedroom above his father&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that fellow Jolyon was in Paris&mdash;what was he doing there? Hanging
      round Irene! The last report from Polteed had hinted that there might be
      something soon. Could it be this? That fellow, with his beard and his
      cursed amused way of speaking&mdash;son of the old man who had given him
      the nickname &lsquo;Man of Property,&rsquo; and bought the fatal house
      from him. Soames had ever resented having had to sell the house at Robin
      Hill; never forgiven his uncle for having bought it, or his cousin for
      living in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reckless of the cold, he threw his window up and gazed out across the
      Park. Bleak and dark the January night; little sound of traffic; a frost
      coming; bare trees; a star or two. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see Polteed
      to-morrow,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;By God! I&rsquo;m mad, I think, to
      want her still. That fellow! If...? Um! No!&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;DEATH OF THE DOG BALTHASAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolyon, who had crossed from Calais by night, arrived at Robin Hill on
      Sunday morning. He had sent no word beforehand, so walked up from the
      station, entering his domain by the coppice gate. Coming to the log seat
      fashioned out of an old fallen trunk, he sat down, first laying his
      overcoat on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lumbago!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what love ends in
      at my time of life!&rsquo; And suddenly Irene seemed very near, just as
      she had been that day of rambling at Fontainebleau when they had sat on a
      log to eat their lunch. Hauntingly near! Odour drawn out of fallen leaves
      by the pale-filtering sunlight soaked his nostrils. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad
      it isn&rsquo;t spring,&rsquo; he thought. With the scent of sap, and the
      song of birds, and the bursting of the blossoms, it would have been
      unbearable! &lsquo;I hope I shall be over it by then, old fool that I am!&rsquo;
      and picking up his coat, he walked on into the field. He passed the pond
      and mounted the hill slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the top a hoarse barking greeted him. Up on the lawn above the
      fernery he could see his old dog Balthasar. The animal, whose dim eyes
      took his master for a stranger, was warning the world against him. Jolyon
      gave his special whistle. Even at that distance of a hundred yards and
      more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brown-white body.
      The old dog got off his haunches, and his tail, close-curled over his
      back, began a feeble, excited fluttering; he came waddling forward,
      gathered momentum, and disappeared over the edge of the fernery. Jolyon
      expected to meet him at the wicket gate, but Balthasar was not there, and,
      rather alarmed, he turned into the fernery. On his fat side, looking up
      with eyes already glazing, the old dog lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my poor old man?&rdquo; cried Jolyon. Balthasar&rsquo;s
      curled and fluffy tail just moved; his filming eyes seemed saying: &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t get up, master, but I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon knelt down; his eyes, very dimmed, could hardly see the slowly
      ceasing heave of the dog&rsquo;s side. He raised the head a little&mdash;very
      heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear man? Where are you hurt?&rdquo; The tail fluttered
      once; the eyes lost the look of life. Jolyon passed his hands all over the
      inert warm bulk. There was nothing&mdash;the heart had simply failed in
      that obese body from the emotion of his master&rsquo;s return. Jolyon
      could feel the muzzle, where a few whitish bristles grew, cooling already
      against his lips. He stayed for some minutes kneeling; with his hand
      beneath the stiffening head. The body was very heavy when he bore it to
      the top of the field; leaves had drifted there, and he strewed it with a
      covering of them; there was no wind, and they would keep him from curious
      eyes until the afternoon. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bury him myself,&rsquo; he
      thought. Eighteen years had gone since he first went into the St. John&rsquo;s
      Wood house with that tiny puppy in his pocket. Strange that the old dog
      should die just now! Was it an omen? He turned at the gate to look back at
      that russet mound, then went slowly towards the house, very choky in the
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      June was at home; she had come down hotfoot on hearing the news of Jolly&rsquo;s
      enlistment. His patriotism had conquered her feeling for the Boers. The
      atmosphere of his house was strange and pocketty when Jolyon came in and
      told them of the dog Balthasar&rsquo;s death. The news had a unifying
      effect. A link with the past had snapped&mdash;the dog Balthasar! Two of
      them could remember nothing before his day; to June he represented the
      last years of her grandfather; to Jolyon that life of domestic stress and
      aesthetic struggle before he came again into the kingdom of his father&rsquo;s
      love and wealth! And he was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he and Jolly took picks and spades and went out to the
      field. They chose a spot close to the russet mound, so that they need not
      carry him far, and, carefully cutting off the surface turf, began to dig.
      They dug in silence for ten minutes, and then rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;so you thought you ought?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jolly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to a bit, of
      course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How exactly those words represented Jolyon&rsquo;s own state of mind
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire you for it, old boy. I don&rsquo;t believe I should have
      done it at your age&mdash;too much of a Forsyte, I&rsquo;m afraid. But I
      suppose the type gets thinner with each generation. Your son, if you have
      one, may be a pure altruist; who knows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be like me, then, Dad; I&rsquo;m beastly selfish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, that you clearly are not.&rdquo; Jolly shook his head,
      and they dug again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange life a dog&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Jolyon suddenly: &ldquo;The
      only four-footer with rudiments of altruism and a sense of God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly looked at his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in God, Dad? I&rsquo;ve never known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At so searching a question from one to whom it was impossible to make a
      light reply, Jolyon stood for a moment feeling his back tried by the
      digging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by God?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there are two
      irreconcilable ideas of God. There&rsquo;s the Unknowable Creative
      Principle&mdash;one believes in That. And there&rsquo;s the Sum of
      altruism in man&mdash;naturally one believes in That.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. That leaves out Christ, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon stared. Christ, the link between those two ideas! Out of the mouth
      of babes! Here was orthodoxy scientifically explained at last! The sublime
      poem of the Christ life was man&rsquo;s attempt to join those two
      irreconcilable conceptions of God. And since the Sum of human altruism was
      as much a part of the Unknowable Creative Principle as anything else in
      Nature and the Universe, a worse link might have been chosen after all!
      Funny&mdash;how one went through life without seeing it in that sort of
      way!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, old man?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly frowned. &ldquo;Of course, my first year we talked a good bit about
      that sort of thing. But in the second year one gives it up; I don&rsquo;t
      know why&mdash;it&rsquo;s awfully interesting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon remembered that he also had talked a good deal about it his first
      year at Cambridge, and given it up in his second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Jolly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the second God, you
      mean, that old Balthasar had a sense of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or he would never have burst his poor old heart because of
      something outside himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t that just selfish emotion, really?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon shook his head. &ldquo;No, dogs are not pure Forsytes, they love
      something outside themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;m one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know, I
      only enlisted because I dared Val Dartie to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bar each other,&rdquo; said Jolly shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered Jolyon. So the feud went on, unto the third
      generation&mdash;this modern feud which had no overt expression?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I tell the boy about it?&rsquo; he thought. But to what end&mdash;if
      he had to stop short of his own part?
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jolly thought: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for Holly to let him know about that
      chap. If she doesn&rsquo;t, it means she doesn&rsquo;t want him told, and
      I should be sneaking. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve stopped it. I&rsquo;d better
      leave well alone!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they dug on in silence, till Jolyon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old man, I think it&rsquo;s big enough.&rdquo; And, resting on
      their spades, they gazed down into the hole where a few leaves had drifted
      already on a sunset wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this part of it,&rdquo; said Jolyon suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do it, Dad. He never cared much for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lift him very gently, leaves and all. I&rsquo;d rather
      not see him again. I&rsquo;ll take his head. Now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With extreme care they raised the old dog&rsquo;s body, whose faded tan
      and white showed here and there under the leaves stirred by the wind. They
      laid it, heavy, cold, and unresponsive, in the grave, and Jolly spread
      more leaves over it, while Jolyon, deeply afraid to show emotion before
      his son, began quickly shovelling the earth on to that still shape. There
      went the past! If only there were a joyful future to look forward to! It
      was like stamping down earth on one&rsquo;s own life. They replaced the
      turf carefully on the smooth little mound, and, grateful that they had
      spared each other&rsquo;s feelings, returned to the house arm-in-arm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;TIMOTHY STAYS THE ROT
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Forsyte &lsquo;Change news of the enlistment spread fast, together with
      the report that June, not to be outdone, was going to become a Red Cross
      nurse. These events were so extreme, so subversive of pure Forsyteism, as
      to have a binding effect upon the family, and Timothy&rsquo;s was thronged
      next Sunday afternoon by members trying to find out what they thought
      about it all, and exchange with each other a sense of family credit. Giles
      and Jesse Hayman would no longer defend the coast but go to South Africa
      quite soon; Jolly and Val would be following in April; as to June&mdash;well,
      you never knew what she would really do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retirement from Spion Kop and the absence of any good news from the
      seat of war imparted an air of reality to all this, clinched in startling
      fashion by Timothy. The youngest of the old Forsytes&mdash;scarcely
      eighty, in fact popularly supposed to resemble their father, &lsquo;Superior
      Dosset,&rsquo; even in his best-known characteristic of drinking Sherry&mdash;had
      been invisible for so many years that he was almost mythical. A long
      generation had elapsed since the risks of a publisher&rsquo;s business had
      worked on his nerves at the age of forty, so that he had got out with a
      mere thirty-five thousand pounds in the world, and started to make his
      living by careful investment. Putting by every year, at compound interest,
      he had doubled his capital in forty years without having once known what
      it was like to shake in his shoes over money matters. He was now putting
      aside some two thousand a year, and, with the care he was taking of
      himself, expected, so Aunt Hester said, to double his capital again before
      he died. What he would do with it then, with his sisters dead and himself
      dead, was often mockingly queried by free spirits such as Francie,
      Euphemia, or young Nicholas&rsquo; second, Christopher, whose spirit was
      so free that he had actually said he was going on the stage. All admitted,
      however, that this was best known to Timothy himself, and possibly to
      Soames, who never divulged a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those few Forsytes who had seen him reported a man of thick and robust
      appearance, not very tall, with a brown-red complexion, grey hair, and
      little of the refinement of feature with which most of the Forsytes had
      been endowed by &lsquo;Superior Dosset&rsquo;s&rsquo; wife, a woman of
      some beauty and a gentle temperament. It was known that he had taken
      surprising interest in the war, sticking flags into a map ever since it
      began, and there was uneasiness as to what would happen if the English
      were driven into the sea, when it would be almost impossible for him to
      put the flags in the right places. As to his knowledge of family movements
      or his views about them, little was known, save that Aunt Hester was
      always declaring that he was very upset. It was, then, in the nature of a
      portent when Forsytes, arriving on the Sunday after the evacuation of
      Spion Kop, became conscious, one after the other, of a presence seated in
      the only really comfortable armchair, back to the light, concealing the
      lower part of his face with a large hand, and were greeted by the awed
      voice of Aunt Hester:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Uncle Timothy, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy&rsquo;s greeting to them all was somewhat identical; and rather,
      as it were, passed over by him than expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How de do? How de do? &lsquo;Xcuse me gettin&rsquo; up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie was present, and Eustace had come in his car; Winifred had brought
      Imogen, breaking the ice of the restitution proceedings with the warmth of
      family appreciation at Val&rsquo;s enlistment; and Marian Tweetyman with
      the last news of Giles and Jesse. These with Aunt Juley and Hester, young
      Nicholas, Euphemia, and&mdash;of all people!&mdash;George, who had come
      with Eustace in the car, constituted an assembly worthy of the family&rsquo;s
      palmiest days. There was not one chair vacant in the whole of the little
      drawing-room, and anxiety was felt lest someone else should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constraint caused by Timothy&rsquo;s presence having worn off a
      little, conversation took a military turn. George asked Aunt Juley when
      she was going out with the Red Cross, almost reducing her to a state of
      gaiety; whereon he turned to Nicholas and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Nick&rsquo;s a warrior bold, isn&rsquo;t he? When&rsquo;s he
      going to don the wild khaki?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Nicholas, smiling with a sort of sweet deprecation, intimated that
      of course his mother was very anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dromios are off, I hear,&rdquo; said George, turning to Marian
      Tweetyman; &ldquo;we shall all be there soon. En avant, the Forsytes!
      Roll, bowl, or pitch! Who&rsquo;s for a cooler?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley gurgled, George was so droll! Should Hester get Timothy&rsquo;s
      map? Then he could show them all where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sound from Timothy, interpreted as assent, Aunt Hester left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      George pursued his image of the Forsyte advance, addressing Timothy as
      Field Marshal; and Imogen, whom he had noted at once for &lsquo;a pretty
      filly,&rsquo;&mdash;as Vivandiere; and holding his top hat between his
      knees, he began to beat it with imaginary drumsticks. The reception
      accorded to his fantasy was mixed. All laughed&mdash;George was licensed;
      but all felt that the family was being &lsquo;rotted&rsquo;. and this
      seemed to them unnatural, now that it was going to give five of its
      members to the service of the Queen. George might go too far; and there
      was relief when he got up, offered his arm to Aunt Juley, marched up to
      Timothy, saluted him, kissed his aunt with mock passion, said, &ldquo;Oh!
      what a treat, dear papa! Come on, Eustace!&rdquo; and walked out, followed
      by the grave and fastidious Eustace, who had never smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley&rsquo;s bewildered, &ldquo;Fancy not waiting for the map! You
      mustn&rsquo;t mind him, Timothy. He&rsquo;s so droll!&rdquo; broke the
      hush, and Timothy removed the hand from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what things are comin&rsquo; to,&rdquo; he was
      heard to say. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about goin&rsquo; out there?
      That&rsquo;s not the way to beat those Boers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie alone had the hardihood to observe: &ldquo;What is, then, Uncle
      Timothy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this new-fangled volunteerin&rsquo; and expense&mdash;lettin&rsquo;
      money out of the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Aunt Hester brought in the map, handling it like a baby with
      eruptions. With the assistance of Euphemia it was laid on the piano, a
      small Colwood grand, last played on, it was believed, the summer before
      Aunt Ann died, thirteen years ago. Timothy rose. He walked over to the
      piano, and stood looking at his map while they all gathered round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the position up
      to date; and very poor it is. H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Francie, greatly daring, &ldquo;but how are you
      going to alter it, Uncle Timothy, without more men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men!&rdquo; said Timothy; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want men&mdash;wastin&rsquo;
      the country&rsquo;s money. You want a Napoleon, he&rsquo;d settle it in a
      month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you haven&rsquo;t got him, Uncle Timothy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their business,&rdquo; replied Timothy. &ldquo;What
      have we kept the Army up for&mdash;to eat their heads off in time of
      peace! They ought to be ashamed of themselves, comin&rsquo; on the country
      to help them like this! Let every man stick to his business, and we shall
      get on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And looking round him, he added almost angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Volunteerin&rsquo;, indeed! Throwin&rsquo; good money after bad! We
      must save! Conserve energy that&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo; And with a
      prolonged sound, not quite a sniff and not quite a snort, he trod on
      Euphemia&rsquo;s toe, and went out, leaving a sensation and a faint scent
      of barley-sugar behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of something said with conviction by one who has evidently made
      a sacrifice to say it is ever considerable. And the eight Forsytes left
      behind, all women except young Nicholas, were silent for a moment round
      the map. Then Francie said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I think he&rsquo;s right, you know. After all, what is the
      Army for? They ought to have known. It&rsquo;s only encouraging them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; cried Aunt Juley, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve been so
      progressive. Think of their giving up their scarlet. They were always so
      proud of it. And now they all look like convicts. Hester and I were saying
      only yesterday we were sure they must feel it very much. Fancy what the
      Iron Duke would have said!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new colour&rsquo;s very smart,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;Val
      looks quite nice in his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so wonder what Jolyon&rsquo;s boy is like. To think we&rsquo;ve
      never seen him! His father must be so proud of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s in Paris,&rdquo; said Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester&rsquo;s shoulder was seen to mount suddenly, as if to ward off
      her sister&rsquo;s next remark, for Juley&rsquo;s crumpled cheeks had
      gushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had dear little Mrs. MacAnder here yesterday, just back from
      Paris. And whom d&rsquo;you think she saw there in the street? You&rsquo;ll
      never guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t try, Auntie,&rdquo; said Euphemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene! Imagine! After all this time; walking with a fair beard....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie! you&rsquo;ll kill me! A fair beard....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley severely, &ldquo;a
      fair-bearded gentleman. And not a day older; she was always so pretty,&rdquo;
      she added, with a sort of lingering apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! tell us about her, Auntie,&rdquo; cried Imogen; &ldquo;I can
      just remember her. She&rsquo;s the skeleton in the family cupboard, isn&rsquo;t
      she? And they&rsquo;re such fun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester sat down. Really, Juley had done it now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t much of a skeleton as I remember her,&rdquo;
      murmured Euphemia, &ldquo;extremely well-covered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said Aunt Juley, &ldquo;what a peculiar way of
      putting it&mdash;not very nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but what was she like?&rdquo; persisted Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, my child,&rdquo; said Francie; &ldquo;a kind
      of modern Venus, very well-dressed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia said sharply: &ldquo;Venus was never dressed, and she had blue
      eyes of melting sapphire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Nicholas took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Nick is awfully strict,&rdquo; said Francie with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has six children,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      very proper she should be careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Uncle Soames awfully fond of her?&rdquo; pursued the inexorable
      Imogen, moving her dark luscious eyes from face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester made a gesture of despair, just as Aunt Juley answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Uncle Soames was very much attached to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she ran off with someone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not; that is&mdash;not precisely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she do, then, Auntie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Imogen,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;we must be getting
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Juley interjected resolutely: &ldquo;She&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t
      behave at all well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; cried Imogen; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as far as I
      ever get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Francie, &ldquo;she had a love affair
      which ended with the young man&rsquo;s death; and then she left your
      uncle. I always rather liked her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She used to give me chocolates,&rdquo; murmured Imogen, &ldquo;and
      smell nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; remarked Euphemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of course at all!&rdquo; replied Francie, who used a
      particularly expensive essence of gillyflower herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what we are about,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley,
      raising her hands, &ldquo;talking of such things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she divorced?&rdquo; asked Imogen from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; cried Aunt Juley; &ldquo;that is&mdash;certainly
      not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound was heard over by the far door. Timothy had re-entered the back
      drawing-room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for my map,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
      been divorced?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, Uncle,&rdquo; replied Francie with perfect truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy took his map off the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have anything of that sort in the family,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;All this enlistin&rsquo;s bad enough. The country&rsquo;s
      breakin&rsquo; up; I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;
      He shook a thick finger at the room: &ldquo;Too many women nowadays, and
      they don&rsquo;t know what they want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he grasped the map firmly with both hands, and went out as if
      afraid of being answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seven women whom he had addressed broke into a subdued murmur, out of
      which emerged Francie&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Really, the Forsytes!&rdquo; and
      Aunt Juley&rsquo;s: &ldquo;He must have his feet in mustard and hot water
      to-night, Hester; will you tell Jane? The blood has gone to his head
      again, I&rsquo;m afraid....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when she and Hester were sitting alone after dinner, she
      dropped a stitch in her crochet, and looked up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester, I can&rsquo;t think where I&rsquo;ve heard that dear Soames
      wants Irene to come back to him again. Who was it told us that George had
      made a funny drawing of him with the words, &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t be happy
      till he gets it&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace,&rdquo; answered Aunt Hester from behind The Times; &ldquo;he
      had it in his pocket, but he wouldn&rsquo;t show it us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley was silent, ruminating. The clock ticked, The Times crackled,
      the fire sent forth its rustling purr. Aunt Juley dropped another stitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have had such a dreadful thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; said Aunt Hester quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but I must. You can&rsquo;t think how dreadful!&rdquo; Her
      voice sank to a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolyon&mdash;Jolyon, they say, has a&mdash;has a fair beard, now.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;PROGRESS OF THE CHASE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days after the dinner at James&rsquo;, Mr. Polteed provided Soames
      with food for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; he said, consulting the key concealed in his
      left hand, &ldquo;47 as we say, has been paying marked attention to 17
      during the last month in Paris. But at present there seems to have been
      nothing very conclusive. The meetings have all been in public places,
      without concealment&mdash;restaurants, the Opera, the Comique, the Louvre,
      Luxembourg Gardens, lounge of the hotel, and so forth. She has not yet
      been traced to his rooms, nor vice versa. They went to Fontainebleau&mdash;but
      nothing of value. In short, the situation is promising, but requires
      patience.&rdquo; And, looking up suddenly, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One rather curious point&mdash;47 has the same name as&mdash;er&mdash;31!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fellow knows I&rsquo;m her husband,&rsquo; thought Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian name&mdash;an odd one&mdash;Jolyon,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Polteed. &ldquo;We know his address in Paris and his residence here. We
      don&rsquo;t wish, of course, to be running a wrong hare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with it, but be careful,&rdquo; said Soames doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctive certainty that this detective fellow had fathomed his secret
      made him all the more reticent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just see if
      there&rsquo;s anything fresh in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned with some letters. Relocking the door, he glanced at the
      envelopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s a personal one from 19 to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed, &ldquo;she says: &lsquo;47 left for
      England to-day. Address on his baggage: Robin Hill. Parted from 17 in
      Louvre Gallery at 3.30; nothing very striking. Thought it best to stay and
      continue observation of 17. You will deal with 47 in England if you think
      desirable, no doubt.&rsquo;&rdquo; And Mr. Polteed lifted an
      unprofessional glance on Soames, as though he might be storing material
      for a book on human nature after he had gone out of business. &ldquo;Very
      intelligent woman, 19, and a wonderful make-up. Not cheap, but earns her
      money well. There&rsquo;s no suspicion of being shadowed so far. But after
      a time, as you know, sensitive people are liable to get the feeling of it,
      without anything definite to go on. I should rather advise letting-up on
      17, and keeping an eye on 47. We can&rsquo;t get at correspondence without
      great risk. I hardly advise that at this stage. But you can tell your
      client that it&rsquo;s looking up very well.&rdquo; And again his narrowed
      eyes gleamed at his taciturn customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames suddenly, &ldquo;I prefer that you should
      keep the watch going discreetly in Paris, and not concern yourself with
      this end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Polteed, &ldquo;we can do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what is the manner between them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you what she says,&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed,
      unlocking a bureau drawer and taking out a file of papers; &ldquo;she sums
      it up somewhere confidentially. Yes, here it is! &lsquo;17 very attractive&mdash;conclude
      47, longer in the tooth&rsquo; (slang for age, you know)&mdash;&rsquo;distinctly
      gone&mdash;waiting his time&mdash;17 perhaps holding off for terms,
      impossible to say without knowing more. But inclined to think on the whole&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
      know her mind&mdash;likely to act on impulse some day. Both have style.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said Soames between close lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Polteed with a smile, showing many white
      teeth, &ldquo;an expression we use. In other words, it&rsquo;s not likely
      to be a weekend business&mdash;they&rsquo;ll come together seriously or
      not at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; muttered Soames, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Polteed, &ldquo;but quite promising.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spider!&rsquo; thought Soames. &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the Green Park that he might cross to Victoria Station and
      take the Underground into the City. For so late in January it was warm;
      sunlight, through the haze, sparkled on the frosty grass&mdash;an
      illumined cobweb of a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little spiders&mdash;and great spiders! And the greatest spinner of all,
      his own tenacity, for ever wrapping its cocoon of threads round any clear
      way out. What was that fellow hanging round Irene for? Was it really as
      Polteed suggested? Or was Jolyon but taking compassion on her loneliness,
      as he would call it&mdash;sentimental radical chap that he had always
      been? If it were, indeed, as Polteed hinted! Soames stood still. It could
      not be! The fellow was seven years older than himself, no better looking!
      No richer! What attraction had he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides, he&rsquo;s come back,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;that doesn&rsquo;t
      look&mdash;-I&rsquo;ll go and see him!&rsquo; and, taking out a card, he
      wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can spare half an hour some afternoon this week, I shall be
      at the Connoisseurs any day between 5.30 and 6, or I could come to the
      Hotch Potch if you prefer it. I want to see you.&mdash;S. F.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up St. James&rsquo;s Street and confided it to the porter at the
      Hotch Potch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Mr. Jolyon Forsyte this as soon as he comes in,&rdquo; he
      said, and took one of the new motor cabs into the City....
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon received that card the same afternoon, and turned his face towards
      the Connoisseurs. What did Soames want now? Had he got wind of Paris? And
      stepping across St. James&rsquo;s Street, he determined to make no secret
      of his visit. &lsquo;But it won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;to
      let him know she&rsquo;s there, unless he knows already.&rsquo; In this
      complicated state of mind he was conducted to where Soames was drinking
      tea in a small bay-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No tea, thanks,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll go on
      smoking if I may.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were not yet drawn, though the lamps outside were lighted;
      the two cousins sat waiting on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in Paris, I hear,&rdquo; said Soames at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; just back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Val told me; he and your boy are going off, then?&rdquo;
      Jolyon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen to see Irene, I suppose. It appears she&rsquo;s
      abroad somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon wreathed himself in smoke before he answered: &ldquo;Yes, I saw
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence; then Soames roused himself in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw you last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was in two minds. We
      talked, and you expressed your opinion. I don&rsquo;t wish to reopen that
      discussion. I only wanted to say this: My position with her is extremely
      difficult. I don&rsquo;t want you to go using your influence against me.
      What happened is a very long time ago. I&rsquo;m going to ask her to let
      bygones be bygones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked her, you know,&rdquo; murmured Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea was new to her then; it came as a shock. But the more she
      thinks of it, the more she must see that it&rsquo;s the only way out for
      both of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my impression of her state of mind,&rdquo; said
      Jolyon with particular calm. &ldquo;And, forgive my saying, you
      misconceive the matter if you think reason comes into it at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his cousin&rsquo;s pale face grow paler&mdash;he had used, without
      knowing it, Irene&rsquo;s own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; muttered Soames, &ldquo;but I see things perhaps
      more plainly than you think. I only want to be sure that you won&rsquo;t
      try to influence her against me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what makes you think I have any influence,&rdquo;
      said Jolyon; &ldquo;but if I have I&rsquo;m bound to use it in the
      direction of what I think is her happiness. I am what they call a &lsquo;feminist,&rsquo;
      I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feminist!&rdquo; repeated Soames, as if seeking to gain time.
      &ldquo;Does that mean that you&rsquo;re against me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bluntly,&rdquo; said Jolyon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against any woman
      living with any man whom she definitely dislikes. It appears to me rotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose each time you see her you put your opinions into her
      mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to be seeing her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going back to Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so far as I know,&rdquo; said Jolyon, conscious of the intent
      watchfulness in Soames&rsquo; face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I had to say. Anyone who comes between man
      and wife, you know, incurs heavy responsibility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon rose and made him a slight bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said, and, without offering to shake hands,
      moved away, leaving Soames staring after him. &lsquo;We Forsytes,&rsquo;
      thought Jolyon, hailing a cab, &lsquo;are very civilised. With simpler
      folk that might have come to a row. If it weren&rsquo;t for my boy going
      to the war....&rsquo; The war! A gust of his old doubt swept over him. A
      precious war! Domination of peoples or of women! Attempts to master and
      possess those who did not want you! The negation of gentle decency!
      Possession, vested rights; and anyone &lsquo;agin&rsquo; &lsquo;em&mdash;outcast!
      &lsquo;Thank Heaven!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I always felt &ldquo;agin&rdquo;
      &lsquo;em, anyway!&rsquo; Yes! Even before his first disastrous marriage
      he could remember fuming over the bludgeoning of Ireland, or the
      matrimonial suits of women trying to be free of men they loathed. Parsons
      would have it that freedom of soul and body were quite different things!
      Pernicious doctrine! Body and soul could not thus be separated. Free will
      was the strength of any tie, and not its weakness. &lsquo;I ought to have
      told Soames,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;that I think him comic. Ah! but he&rsquo;s
      tragic, too!&rsquo; Was there anything, indeed, more tragic in the world
      than a man enslaved by his own possessive instinct, who couldn&rsquo;t see
      the sky for it, or even enter fully into what another person felt! &lsquo;I
      must write and warn her,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s going to
      have another try.&rsquo; And all the way home to Robin Hill he rebelled at
      the strength of that duty to his son which prevented him from posting back
      to Paris....
    </p>
    <p>
      But Soames sat long in his chair, the prey of a no less gnawing ache&mdash;a
      jealous ache, as if it had been revealed to him that this fellow held
      precedence of himself, and had spun fresh threads of resistance to his way
      out. &lsquo;Does that mean that you&rsquo;re against me?&rsquo; he had got
      nothing out of that disingenuous question. Feminist! Phrasey fellow!
      &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t rush things,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I have some
      breathing space; he&rsquo;s not going back to Paris, unless he was lying.
      I&rsquo;ll let the spring come!&rsquo; Though how the spring could serve
      him, save by adding to his ache, he could not tell. And gazing down into
      the street, where figures were passing from pool to pool of the light from
      the high lamps, he thought: &lsquo;Nothing seems any good&mdash;nothing
      seems worth while. I&rsquo;m loney&mdash;that&rsquo;s the trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes; and at once he seemed to see Irene, in a dark street
      below a church&mdash;passing, turning her neck so that he caught the gleam
      of her eyes and her white forehead under a little dark hat, which had gold
      spangles on it and a veil hanging down behind. He opened his eyes&mdash;so
      vividly he had seen her! A woman was passing below, but not she! Oh no,
      there was nothing there!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;&rsquo;HERE WE ARE AGAIN!&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Imogen&rsquo;s frocks for her first season exercised the judgment of her
      mother and the purse of her grandfather all through the month of March.
      With Forsyte tenacity Winifred quested for perfection. It took her mind
      off the slowly approaching rite which would give her a freedom but
      doubtfully desired; took her mind, too, off her boy and his fast
      approaching departure for a war from which the news remained disquieting.
      Like bees busy on summer flowers, or bright gadflies hovering and darting
      over spiky autumn blossoms, she and her &lsquo;little daughter,&rsquo;
      tall nearly as herself and with a bust measurement not far inferior,
      hovered in the shops of Regent Street, the establishments of Hanover
      Square and of Bond Street, lost in consideration and the feel of fabrics.
      Dozens of young women of striking deportment and peculiar gait paraded
      before Winifred and Imogen, draped in &lsquo;creations.&rsquo; The models&mdash;&rsquo;Very
      new, modom; quite the latest thing&mdash;&rsquo; which those two
      reluctantly turned down, would have filled a museum; the models which they
      were obliged to have nearly emptied James&rsquo; bank. It was no good
      doing things by halves, Winifred felt, in view of the need for making this
      first and sole untarnished season a conspicuous success. Their patience in
      trying the patience of those impersonal creatures who swam about before
      them could alone have been displayed by such as were moved by faith. It
      was for Winifred a long prostration before her dear goddess Fashion,
      fervent as a Catholic might make before the Virgin; for Imogen an
      experience by no means too unpleasant&mdash;she often looked so nice, and
      flattery was implicit everywhere: in a word it was &lsquo;amusing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the 20th of March, having, as it were, gutted
      Skywards, they had sought refreshment over the way at Caramel and Baker&rsquo;s,
      and, stored with chocolate frothed at the top with cream, turned homewards
      through Berkeley Square of an evening touched with spring. Opening the
      door&mdash;freshly painted a light olive-green; nothing neglected that
      year to give Imogen a good send-off&mdash;Winifred passed towards the
      silver basket to see if anyone had called, and suddenly her nostrils
      twitched. What was that scent?
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen had taken up a novel sent from the library, and stood absorbed.
      Rather sharply, because of the queer feeling in her breast, Winifred said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that up, dear, and have a rest before dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen, still reading, passed up the stairs. Winifred heard the door of
      her room slammed to, and drew a long savouring breath. Was it spring
      tickling her senses&mdash;whipping up nostalgia for her &lsquo;clown,&rsquo;
      against all wisdom and outraged virtue? A male scent! A faint reek of
      cigars and lavender-water not smelt since that early autumn night six
      months ago, when she had called him &lsquo;the limit.&rsquo; Whence came
      it, or was it ghost of scent&mdash;sheer emanation from memory? She looked
      round her. Nothing&mdash;not a thing, no tiniest disturbance of her hall,
      nor of the diningroom. A little day-dream of a scent&mdash;illusory,
      saddening, silly! In the silver basket were new cards, two with &lsquo;Mr.
      and Mrs. Polegate Thom,&rsquo; and one with &lsquo;Mr. Polegate Thom&rsquo;
      thereon; she sniffed them, but they smelled severe. &lsquo;I must be
      tired,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and lie down.&rsquo;
      Upstairs the drawing-room was darkened, waiting for some hand to give it
      evening light; and she passed on up to her bedroom. This, too, was
      half-curtained and dim, for it was six o&rsquo;clock. Winifred threw off
      her coat&mdash;that scent again!&mdash;then stood, as if shot, transfixed
      against the bed-rail. Something dark had risen from the sofa in the far
      corner. A word of horror&mdash;in her family&mdash;escaped her: &ldquo;God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Monty,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clutching the bed-rail, Winifred reached up and turned the switch of the
      light hanging above her dressing-table. He appeared just on the rim of the
      light&rsquo;s circumference, emblazoned from the absence of his
      watch-chain down to boots neat and sooty brown, but&mdash;yes!&mdash;split
      at the toecap. His chest and face were shadowy. Surely he was thin&mdash;or
      was it a trick of the light? He advanced, lighted now from toe-cap to the
      top of his dark head&mdash;surely a little grizzled! His complexion had
      darkened, sallowed; his black moustache had lost boldness, become
      sardonic; there were lines which she did not know about his face. There
      was no pin in his tie. His suit&mdash;ah!&mdash;she knew that&mdash;but
      how unpressed, unglossy! She stared again at the toe-cap of his boot.
      Something big and relentless had been &lsquo;at him,&rsquo; had turned and
      twisted, raked and scraped him. And she stayed, not speaking, motionless,
      staring at that crack across the toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I got the order. I&rsquo;m back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&rsquo;s bosom began to heave. The nostalgia for her husband which
      had rushed up with that scent was struggling with a deeper jealousy than
      any she had felt yet. There he was&mdash;a dark, and as if harried, shadow
      of his sleek and brazen self! What force had done this to him&mdash;squeezed
      him like an orange to its dry rind! That woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
      beastly time. By God! I came steerage. I&rsquo;ve got nothing but what I
      stand up in, and that bag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who has the rest?&rdquo; cried Winifred, suddenly alive.
      &ldquo;How dared you come? You knew it was just for divorce that you got
      that order to come back. Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They held each to the rail of the big bed where they had spent so many
      years of nights together. Many times, yes&mdash;many times she had wanted
      him back. But now that he had come she was filled with this cold and
      deadly resentment. He put his hand up to his moustache; but did not frizz
      and twist it in the old familiar way, he just pulled it downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;If you knew the time I&rsquo;ve had!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the kids all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred nodded. &ldquo;How did you get in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the maids don&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t stay here, Monty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered a little sardonic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look at me! That&mdash;that damned....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mention her,&rdquo; cried Winifred, &ldquo;I go straight out
      to Park Lane and I don&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he did a simple thing, but so uncharacteristic that it moved her.
      He shut his eyes. It was as if he had said: &lsquo;All right! I&rsquo;m
      dead to the world!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have a room for the night,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your
      things are still here. Only Imogen is at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back against the bed-rail. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s in your
      hands,&rdquo; and his own made a writhing movement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      through it. You needn&rsquo;t hit too hard&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t worth
      while. I&rsquo;ve been frightened; I&rsquo;ve been frightened, Freddie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That old pet name, disused for years and years, sent a shiver through
      Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to do with him?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;What in God&rsquo;s
      name am I to do with him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a cigarette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one from a little box she kept up there for when she couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep at night, and lighted it. With that action the matter-of-fact side
      of her nature came to life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and have a hot bath. I&rsquo;ll put some clothes out for you in
      the dressing-room. We can talk later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and fixed his eyes on her&mdash;they looked half-dead, or was
      it that the folds in the lids had become heavier?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not the same,&rsquo; she thought. He would never be
      quite the same again! But what would he be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said, and went towards the door. He even moved
      differently, like a man who has lost illusion and doubts whether it is
      worth while to move at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, and she heard the water in the bath running, she put out
      a complete set of garments on the bed in his dressing-room, then went
      downstairs and fetched up the biscuit box and whisky. Putting on her coat
      again, and listening a moment at the bathroom door, she went down and out.
      In the street she hesitated. Past seven o&rsquo;clock! Would Soames be at
      his Club or at Park Lane? She turned towards the latter. Back!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had always feared it&mdash;she had sometimes hoped it.... Back! So
      like him&mdash;clown that he was&mdash;with this: &lsquo;Here we are
      again!&rsquo; to make fools of them all&mdash;of the Law, of Soames, of
      herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet to have done with the Law, not to have that murky cloud hanging over
      her and the children! What a relief! Ah! but how to accept his return?
      That &lsquo;woman&rsquo; had ravaged him, taken from him passion such as
      he had never bestowed on herself, such as she had not thought him capable
      of. There was the sting! That selfish, blatant &lsquo;clown&rsquo; of
      hers, whom she herself had never really stirred, had been swept and
      ungarnished by another woman! Insulting! Too insulting! Not right, not
      decent to take him back! And yet she had asked for him; the Law perhaps
      would make her now! He was as much her husband as ever&mdash;she had put
      herself out of court! And all he wanted, no doubt, was money&mdash;to keep
      him in cigars and lavender-water! That scent! &lsquo;After all, I&rsquo;m
      not old,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;not old yet!&rsquo; But that woman who
      had reduced him to those words: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been through it. I&rsquo;ve
      been frightened&mdash;frightened, Freddie!&rsquo; She neared her father&rsquo;s
      house, driven this way and that, while all the time the Forsyte undertow
      was drawing her to deep conclusion that after all he was her property, to
      be held against a robbing world. And so she came to James&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Soames? In his room? I&rsquo;ll go up; don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother was dressing. She found him before a mirror, tying a black bow
      with an air of despising its ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, contemplating her in the glass; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
      wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monty!&rdquo; said Winifred stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames spun round. &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoist,&rdquo; muttered Soames, &ldquo;with our own petard. Why the
      deuce didn&rsquo;t you let me try cruelty? I always knew it was too much
      risk this way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Don&rsquo;t talk about that! What shall I do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames answered, with a deep, deep sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Winifred impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he to say for himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. One of his boots is split across the toe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course! On his beam ends. So&mdash;it
      begins again! This&rsquo;ll about finish father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we keep it from him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. He has an uncanny flair for anything that&rsquo;s
      worrying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he brooded, with fingers hooked into his blue silk braces. &ldquo;There
      ought to be some way in law,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;to make him safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Winifred, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be made a fool of
      again; I&rsquo;d sooner put up with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stared at each other. Their hearts were full of feeling, but they
      could give it no expression&mdash;Forsytes that they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you leave him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the bath,&rdquo; and Winifred gave a little bitter laugh.
      &ldquo;The only thing he&rsquo;s brought back is lavender-water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re thoroughly upset. I&rsquo;ll
      go back with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to make terms with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terms! It&rsquo;ll always be the same. When he recovers&mdash;cards
      and betting, drink and...!&rdquo; She was silent, remembering the look on
      her husband&rsquo;s face. The burnt child&mdash;the burnt child.
      Perhaps...!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recovers?&rdquo; replied Soames: &ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; burnt out; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took his waistcoat from a chair and put it on, he took his coat and
      got into it, he scented his handkerchief with eau-de-Cologne, threaded his
      watch-chain, and said: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of her own trouble Winifred was sorry for him, as if in
      that little saying he had revealed deep trouble of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see mother,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be with father in their room. Come down quietly to the
      study. I&rsquo;ll get her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred stole down to the little dark study, chiefly remarkable for a
      Canaletto too doubtful to be placed elsewhere, and a fine collection of
      Law Reports unopened for many years. Here she stood, with her back to
      maroon-coloured curtains close-drawn, staring at the empty grate, till her
      mother came in followed by Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my poor dear!&rdquo; said Emily: &ldquo;How miserable you look
      in here! This is too bad of him, really!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As a family they had so guarded themselves from the expression of all
      unfashionable emotion that it was impossible to go up and give her
      daughter a good hug. But there was comfort in her cushioned voice, and her
      still dimpled shoulders under some rare black lace. Summoning pride and
      the desire not to distress her mother, Winifred said in her most off-hand
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mother; no good fussing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said Emily, looking at Soames, &ldquo;why
      Winifred shouldn&rsquo;t tell him that she&rsquo;ll prosecute him if he
      doesn&rsquo;t keep off the premises. He took her pearls; and if he&rsquo;s
      not brought them back, that&rsquo;s quite enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred smiled. They would all plunge about with suggestions of this and
      that, but she knew already what she would be doing, and that was&mdash;nothing.
      The feeling that, after all, she had won a sort of victory, retained her
      property, was every moment gaining ground in her. No! if she wanted to
      punish him, she could do it at home without the world knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;come into the dining-room
      comfortably&mdash;you must stay and have dinner with us. Leave it to me to
      tell your father.&rdquo; And, as Winifred moved towards the door, she
      turned out the light. Not till then did they see the disaster in the
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, attracted by light from a room never lighted, James was standing
      with his duncoloured camel-hair shawl folded about him, so that his arms
      were not free and his silvered head looked cut off from his fashionably
      trousered legs as if by an expanse of desert. He stood, inimitably
      stork-like, with an expression as if he saw before him a frog too large to
      swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell your father? You
      never tell me anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment found Emily without reply. It was Winifred who went up to him,
      and, laying one hand on each of his swathed, helpless arms, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monty&rsquo;s not gone bankrupt, Father. He&rsquo;s only come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all three expected something serious to happen, and were glad she had
      kept that grip of his arms, but they did not know the depth of root in
      that shadowy old Forsyte. Something wry occurred about his shaven mouth
      and chin, something scratchy between those long silvery whiskers. Then he
      said with a sort of dignity: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be the death of me. I knew
      how it would be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t worry, Father,&rdquo; said Winifred calmly.
      &ldquo;I mean to make him behave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Here, take this thing off, I&rsquo;m
      hot.&rdquo; They unwound the shawl. He turned, and walked firmly to the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any soup,&rdquo; he said to Warmson, and sat
      down in his chair. They all sat down too, Winifred still in her hat, while
      Warmson laid the fourth place. When he left the room, James said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      he brought back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James concentrated his eyes on his own image in a tablespoon. &ldquo;Divorce!&rdquo;
      he muttered; &ldquo;rubbish! What was I about? I ought to have paid him an
      allowance to stay out of England. Soames you go and propose it to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed so right and simple a suggestion that even Winifred was
      surprised when she said: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll keep him now he&rsquo;s
      back; he must just behave&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all looked at her. It had always been known that Winifred had pluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out there!&rdquo; said James elliptically, &ldquo;who knows what
      cut-throats! You look for his revolver! Don&rsquo;t go to bed without. You
      ought to have Warmson to sleep in the house. I&rsquo;ll see him myself
      tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were touched by this declaration, and Emily said comfortably: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      right, James, we won&rsquo;t have any nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered James darkly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The advent of Warmson with fish diverted conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, directly after dinner, Winifred went over to kiss her father
      good-night, he looked up with eyes so full of question and distress that
      she put all the comfort she could into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Daddy, dear; don&rsquo;t worry. I shan&rsquo;t
      need anyone&mdash;he&rsquo;s quite bland. I shall only be upset if you
      worry. Good-night, bless you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James repeated the words, &ldquo;Bless you!&rdquo; as if he did not quite
      know what they meant, and his eyes followed her to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached home before nine, and went straight upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie was lying on the bed in his dressing-room, fully redressed in a
      blue serge suit and pumps; his arms were crossed behind his head, and an
      extinct cigarette drooped from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred remembered ridiculously the flowers in her window-boxes after a
      blazing summer day; the way they lay, or rather stood&mdash;parched, yet
      rested by the sun&rsquo;s retreat. It was as if a little dew had come
      already on her burnt-up husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said apathetically: &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve been to Park Lane.
      How&rsquo;s the old man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred could not help the bitter answer: &ldquo;Not dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He winced, actually he winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand, Monty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will not have him
      worried. If you aren&rsquo;t going to behave yourself, you may go back,
      you may go anywhere. Have you had dinner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like some?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imogen offered me some. I didn&rsquo;t want any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen! In the plenitude of emotion Winifred had forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve seen her? What did she say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me a kiss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With mortification Winifred saw his dark sardonic face relaxed. &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;
      she thought, &lsquo;he cares for her, not for me a bit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie&rsquo;s eyes were moving from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know about me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flashed through Winifred that here was the weapon she needed. He minded
      their knowing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Val knows. The others don&rsquo;t; they only know you went
      away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him sigh with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they shall know,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;if you give me
      cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;hit me! I&rsquo;m down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred went up to the bed. &ldquo;Look here, Monty! I don&rsquo;t want
      to hit you. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. I shan&rsquo;t allude to
      anything. I&rsquo;m not going to worry. What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; She
      was silent a moment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more, though, and I
      won&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;d better know. You&rsquo;ve made me suffer. But I
      used to be fond of you. For the sake of that....&rdquo; She met the
      heavy-lidded gaze of his brown eyes with the downward stare of her
      green-grey eyes; touched his hand suddenly, turned her back, and went into
      her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there a long time before her glass, fingering her rings, thinking
      of this subdued dark man, almost a stranger to her, on the bed in the
      other room; resolutely not &lsquo;worrying,&rsquo; but gnawed by jealousy
      of what he had been through, and now and again just visited by pity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;OUTLANDISH NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames doggedly let the spring come&mdash;no easy task for one conscious
      that time was flying, his birds in the bush no nearer the hand, no issue
      from the web anywhere visible. Mr. Polteed reported nothing, except that
      his watch went on&mdash;costing a lot of money. Val and his cousin were
      gone to the war, whence came news more favourable; Dartie was behaving
      himself so far; James had retained his health; business prospered almost
      terribly&mdash;there was nothing to worry Soames except that he was
      &lsquo;held up,&rsquo; could make no step in any direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not exactly avoid Soho, for he could not afford to let them think
      that he had &lsquo;piped off,&rsquo; as James would have put it&mdash;he
      might want to &lsquo;pipe on&rsquo; again at any minute. But he had to be
      so restrained and cautious that he would often pass the door of the
      Restaurant Bretagne without going in, and wander out of the purlieus of
      that region which always gave him the feeling of having been possessively
      irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered thus one May night into Regent Street and the most amazing
      crowd he had ever seen; a shrieking, whistling, dancing, jostling,
      grotesque and formidably jovial crowd, with false noses and mouth-organs,
      penny whistles and long feathers, every appanage of idiocy, as it seemed
      to him. Mafeking! Of course, it had been relieved! Good! But was that an
      excuse? Who were these people, what were they, where had they come from
      into the West End? His face was tickled, his ears whistled into. Girls
      cried: &lsquo;Keep your hair on, stucco!&rsquo; A youth so knocked off his
      top-hat that he recovered it with difficulty. Crackers were exploding
      beneath his nose, between his feet. He was bewildered, exasperated,
      offended. This stream of people came from every quarter, as if impulse had
      unlocked flood-gates, let flow waters of whose existence he had heard,
      perhaps, but believed in never. This, then, was the populace, the
      innumerable living negation of gentility and Forsyteism. This was&mdash;egad!&mdash;Democracy!
      It stank, yelled, was hideous! In the East End, or even Soho, perhaps&mdash;but
      here in Regent Street, in Piccadilly! What were the police about! In 1900,
      Soames, with his Forsyte thousands, had never seen the cauldron with the
      lid off; and now looking into it, could hardly believe his scorching eyes.
      The whole thing was unspeakable! These people had no restraint, they
      seemed to think him funny; such swarms of them, rude, coarse, laughing&mdash;and
      what laughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing sacred to them! He shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they began to
      break windows. In Pall Mall, past those august dwellings, to enter which
      people paid sixty pounds, this shrieking, whistling, dancing dervish of a
      crowd was swarming. From the Club windows his own kind were looking out on
      them with regulated amusement. They didn&rsquo;t realise! Why, this was
      serious&mdash;might come to anything! The crowd was cheerful, but some day
      they would come in different mood! He remembered there had been a mob in
      the late eighties, when he was at Brighton; they had smashed things and
      made speeches. But more than dread, he felt a deep surprise. They were
      hysterical&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t English! And all about the relief of a
      little town as big as&mdash;Watford, six thousand miles away. Restraint,
      reserve! Those qualities to him more dear almost than life, those
      indispensable attributes of property and culture, where were they? It wasn&rsquo;t
      English! No, it wasn&rsquo;t English! So Soames brooded, threading his way
      on. It was as if he had suddenly caught sight of someone cutting the
      covenant &lsquo;for quiet possession&rsquo; out of his legal documents; or
      of a monster lurking and stalking out in the future, casting its shadow
      before. Their want of stolidity, their want of reverence! It was like
      discovering that nine-tenths of the people of England were foreigners. And
      if that were so&mdash;then, anything might happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hyde Park Corner he ran into George Forsyte, very sunburnt from racing,
      holding a false nose in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Soames!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have a nose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames responded with a pale smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got this from one of these sportsmen,&rdquo; went on George, who
      had evidently been dining; &ldquo;had to lay him out&mdash;for trying to
      bash my hat. I say, one of these days we shall have to fight these chaps,
      they&rsquo;re getting so damned cheeky&mdash;all radicals and socialists.
      They want our goods. You tell Uncle James that, it&rsquo;ll make him
      sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In vino veritas,&rsquo; thought Soames, but he only nodded, and
      passed on up Hamilton Place. There was but a trickle of roysterers in Park
      Lane, not very noisy. And looking up at the houses he thought: &lsquo;After
      all, we&rsquo;re the backbone of the country. They won&rsquo;t upset us
      easily. Possession&rsquo;s nine points of the law.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he closed the door of his father&rsquo;s house behind him, all
      that queer outlandish nightmare in the streets passed out of his mind
      almost as completely as if, having dreamed it, he had awakened in the warm
      clean morning comfort of his spring-mattressed bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking into the centre of the great empty drawing-room, he stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wife! Somebody to talk things over with. One had a right! Damn it! One
      had a right!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;SOAMES IN PARIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames had travelled little. Aged nineteen he had made the &lsquo;petty
      tour&rsquo; with his father, mother, and Winifred&mdash;Brussels, the
      Rhine, Switzerland, and home by way of Paris. Aged twenty-seven, just when
      he began to take interest in pictures, he had spent five hot weeks in
      Italy, looking into the Renaissance&mdash;not so much in it as he had been
      led to expect&mdash;and a fortnight in Paris on his way back, looking into
      himself, as became a Forsyte surrounded by people so strongly self-centred
      and &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; as the French. His knowledge of their language
      being derived from his public school, he did not understand them when they
      spoke. Silence he had found better for all parties; one did not make a
      fool of oneself. He had disliked the look of the men&rsquo;s clothes, the
      closed-in cabs, the theatres which looked like bee-hives, the Galleries
      which smelled of beeswax. He was too cautious and too shy to explore that
      side of Paris supposed by Forsytes to constitute its attraction under the
      rose; and as for a collector&rsquo;s bargain&mdash;not one to be had! As
      Nicholas might have put it&mdash;they were a grasping lot. He had come
      back uneasy, saying Paris was overrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, in June of 1900 he went to Paris, it was but his third
      attempt on the centre of civilisation. This time, however, the mountain
      was going to Mahomet; for he felt by now more deeply civilised than Paris,
      and perhaps he really was. Moreover, he had a definite objective. This was
      no mere genuflexion to a shrine of taste and immorality, but the
      prosecution of his own legitimate affairs. He went, indeed, because things
      were getting past a joke. The watch went on and on, and&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!
      Jolyon had never returned to Paris, and no one else was &lsquo;suspect!&rsquo;
      Busy with new and very confidential matters, Soames was realising more
      than ever how essential reputation is to a solicitor. But at night and in
      his leisure moments he was ravaged by the thought that time was always
      flying and money flowing in, and his own future as much &lsquo;in irons&rsquo;
      as ever. Since Mafeking night he had become aware that a &lsquo;young fool
      of a doctor&rsquo; was hanging round Annette. Twice he had come across him&mdash;a
      cheerful young fool, not more than thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing annoyed Soames so much as cheerfulness&mdash;an indecent,
      extravagant sort of quality, which had no relation to facts. The mixture
      of his desires and hopes was, in a word, becoming torture; and lately the
      thought had come to him that perhaps Irene knew she was being shadowed: It
      was this which finally decided him to go and see for himself; to go and
      once more try to break down her repugnance, her refusal to make her own
      and his path comparatively smooth once more. If he failed again&mdash;well,
      he would see what she did with herself, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to an hotel in the Rue Caumartin, highly recommended to Forsytes,
      where practically nobody spoke French. He had formed no plan. He did not
      want to startle her; yet must contrive that she had no chance to evade him
      by flight. And next morning he set out in bright weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris had an air of gaiety, a sparkle over its star-shape which almost
      annoyed Soames. He stepped gravely, his nose lifted a little sideways in
      real curiosity. He desired now to understand things French. Was not
      Annette French? There was much to be got out of his visit, if he could
      only get it. In this laudable mood and the Place de la Concorde he was
      nearly run down three times. He came on the &lsquo;Cours la Reine,&rsquo;
      where Irene&rsquo;s hotel was situated, almost too suddenly, for he had
      not yet fixed on his procedure. Crossing over to the river side, he noted
      the building, white and cheerful-looking, with green sunblinds, seen
      through a screen of plane-tree leaves. And, conscious that it would be far
      better to meet her casually in some open place than to risk a call, he sat
      down on a bench whence he could watch the entrance. It was not quite
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, and improbable that she had yet gone out. Some
      pigeons were strutting and preening their feathers in the pools of
      sunlight between the shadows of the plane-trees. A workman in a blue
      blouse passed, and threw them crumbs from the paper which contained his
      dinner. A &lsquo;bonne&rsquo; coiffed with ribbon shepherded two little
      girls with pig-tails and frilled drawers. A cab meandered by, whose cocher
      wore a blue coat and a black-glazed hat. To Soames a kind of affectation
      seemed to cling about it all, a sort of picturesqueness which was out of
      date. A theatrical people, the French! He lit one of his rare cigarettes,
      with a sense of injury that Fate should be casting his life into
      outlandish waters. He shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Irene quite enjoyed this
      foreign life; she had never been properly English&mdash;even to look at!
      And he began considering which of those windows could be hers under the
      green sunblinds. How could he word what he had come to say so that it
      might pierce the defence of her proud obstinacy? He threw the fag-end of
      his cigarette at a pigeon, with the thought: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay
      here for ever twiddling my thumbs. Better give it up and call on her in
      the late afternoon.&rsquo; But he still sat on, heard twelve strike, and
      then half-past. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait till one,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;while I&rsquo;m about it.&rsquo; But just then he started up, and
      shrinkingly sat down again. A woman had come out in a cream-coloured
      frock, and was moving away under a fawn-coloured parasol. Irene herself!
      He waited till she was too far away to recognise him, then set out after
      her. She was strolling as though she had no particular objective; moving,
      if he remembered rightly, toward the Bois de Boulogne. For half an hour at
      least he kept his distance on the far side of the way till she had passed
      into the Bois itself. Was she going to meet someone after all? Some
      confounded Frenchman&mdash;one of those &lsquo;Bel Ami&rsquo; chaps,
      perhaps, who had nothing to do but hang about women&mdash;for he had read
      that book with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination. He followed
      doggedly along a shady alley, losing sight of her now and then when the
      path curved. And it came back to him how, long ago, one night in Hyde Park
      he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree, from seat to seat, hunting
      blindly, ridiculously, in burning jealousy for her and young Bosinney. The
      path bent sharply, and, hurrying, he came on her sitting in front of a
      small fountain&mdash;a little green-bronze Niobe veiled in hair to her
      slender hips, gazing at the pool she had wept: He came on her so suddenly
      that he was past before he could turn and take off his hat. She did not
      start up. She had always had great self-command&mdash;it was one of the
      things he most admired in her, one of his greatest grievances against her,
      because he had never been able to tell what she was thinking. Had she
      realised that he was following? Her self-possession made him angry; and,
      disdaining to explain his presence, he pointed to the mournful little
      Niobe, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a good thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see, then, that she was struggling to preserve her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to startle you; is this one of your haunts?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little lonely.&rdquo; As he spoke, a lady, strolling by, paused
      to look at the fountain and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s eyes followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, prodding the ground with her parasol, &ldquo;never
      lonely. One has always one&rsquo;s shadow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames understood; and, looking at her hard, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your own fault. You can be free of it at any
      moment. Irene, come back to me, and be free.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Soames, stamping his foot; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      inhuman. Listen! Is there any condition I can make which will bring you
      back to me? If I promise you a separate house&mdash;and just a visit now
      and then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene rose, something wild suddenly in her face and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None! None! None! You may hunt me to the grave. I will not come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Outraged and on edge, Soames recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a scene!&rdquo; he said sharply. And they both
      stood motionless, staring at the little Niobe, whose greenish flesh the
      sunlight was burnishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your last word, then,&rdquo; muttered Soames,
      clenching his hands; &ldquo;you condemn us both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene bent her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come back. Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of monstrous injustice flared up in Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and listen to me a moment. You gave me
      a sacred vow&mdash;you came to me without a penny. You had all I could
      give you. You broke that vow without cause, you made me a by-word; you
      refused me a child; you&rsquo;ve left me in prison; you&mdash;you still
      move me so that I want you&mdash;I want you. Well, what do you think of
      yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene turned, her face was deadly pale, her eyes burning dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God made me as I am,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;wicked if you like&mdash;but
      not so wicked that I&rsquo;ll give myself again to a man I hate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight gleamed on her hair as she moved away, and seemed to lay a
      caress all down her clinging cream-coloured frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames could neither speak nor move. That word &lsquo;hate&rsquo;&mdash;so
      extreme, so primitive&mdash;made all the Forsyte in him tremble. With a
      deep imprecation he strode away from where she had vanished, and ran
      almost into the arms of the lady sauntering back&mdash;the fool, the
      shadowing fool!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon dripping with perspiration, in the depths of the Bois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I need have no consideration for
      her now; she has not a grain of it for me. I&rsquo;ll show her this very
      day that she&rsquo;s my wife still.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the way home to his hotel, he was forced to the conclusion that he
      did not know what he meant. One could not make scenes in public, and short
      of scenes in public what was there he could do? He almost cursed his own
      thin-skinnedness. She might deserve no consideration; but he&mdash;alas!
      deserved some at his own hands. And sitting lunchless in the hall of his
      hotel, with tourists passing every moment, Baedeker in hand, he was
      visited by black dejection. In irons! His whole life, with every natural
      instinct and every decent yearning gagged and fettered, and all because
      Fate had driven him seventeen years ago to set his heart upon this woman&mdash;so
      utterly, that even now he had no real heart to set on any other! Cursed
      was the day he had met her, and his eyes for seeing in her anything but
      the cruel Venus she was! And yet, still seeing her with the sunlight on
      the clinging China crepe of her gown, he uttered a little groan, so that a
      tourist who was passing, thought: &lsquo;Man in pain! Let&rsquo;s see!
      what did I have for lunch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, in front of a cafe near the Opera, over a glass of cold tea with
      lemon and a straw in it, he took the malicious resolution to go and dine
      at her hotel. If she were there, he would speak to her; if she were not,
      he would leave a note. He dressed carefully, and wrote as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your idyll with that fellow Jolyon Forsyte is known to me at all
      events. If you pursue it, understand that I will leave no stone unturned
      to make things unbearable for him. &lsquo;S. F.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed this note but did not address it, refusing to write the maiden
      name which she had impudently resumed, or to put the word Forsyte on the
      envelope lest she should tear it up unread. Then he went out, and made his
      way through the glowing streets, abandoned to evening pleasure-seekers.
      Entering her hotel, he took his seat in a far corner of the dining-room
      whence he could see all entrances and exits. She was not there. He ate
      little, quickly, watchfully. She did not come. He lingered in the lounge
      over his coffee, drank two liqueurs of brandy. But still she did not come.
      He went over to the keyboard and examined the names. Number twelve, on the
      first floor! And he determined to take the note up himself. He mounted
      red-carpeted stairs, past a little salon; eight-ten-twelve! Should he
      knock, push the note under, or...? He looked furtively round and turned
      the handle. The door opened, but into a little space leading to another
      door; he knocked on that&mdash;no answer. The door was locked. It fitted
      very closely to the floor; the note would not go under. He thrust it back
      into his pocket, and stood a moment listening. He felt somehow certain
      that she was not there. And suddenly he came away, passing the little
      salon down the stairs. He stopped at the bureau and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly see that Mrs. Heron has this note?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Heron left to-day, Monsieur&mdash;suddenly, about three o&rsquo;clock.
      There was illness in her family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames compressed his lips. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;do you know
      her address?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non, Monsieur. England, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames put the note back into his pocket and went out. He hailed an open
      horse-cab which was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive me anywhere!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, who, obviously, did not understand, smiled, and waved his whip.
      And Soames was borne along in that little yellow-wheeled Victoria all over
      star-shaped Paris, with here and there a pause, and the question, &ldquo;C&rsquo;est
      par ici, Monsieur?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, go on,&rdquo; till the man gave it up
      in despair, and the yellow-wheeled chariot continued to roll between the
      tall, flat-fronted shuttered houses and plane-tree avenues&mdash;a little
      Flying Dutchman of a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like my life,&rsquo; thought Soames, &lsquo;without object, on and
      on!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;IN THE WEB
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames returned to England the following day, and on the third morning
      received a visit from Mr. Polteed, who wore a flower and carried a brown
      billycock hat. Soames motioned him to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news from the war is not so bad, is it?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Polteed. &ldquo;I hope I see you well, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks! quite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed leaned forward, smiled, opened his hand, looked into it, and
      said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve done your business for you at last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; ejaculated Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen reports quite suddenly what I think we shall be justified
      in calling conclusive evidence,&rdquo; and Mr. Polteed paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 10th instant, after witnessing an interview between 17 and a
      party, earlier in the day, 19 can swear to having seen him coming out of
      her bedroom in the hotel about ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening. With a
      little care in the giving of the evidence that will be enough, especially
      as 17 has left Paris&mdash;no doubt with the party in question. In fact,
      they both slipped off, and we haven&rsquo;t got on to them again, yet; but
      we shall&mdash;we shall. She&rsquo;s worked hard under very difficult
      circumstances, and I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s brought it off at last.&rdquo;
      Mr. Polteed took out a cigarette, tapped its end against the table, looked
      at Soames, and put it back. The expression on his client&rsquo;s face was
      not encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this new person?&rdquo; said Soames abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;ll swear to the fact, and she&rsquo;s
      got his appearance pat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed took out a letter, and began reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Middle-aged, medium height, blue dittoes in afternoon,
      evening dress at night, pale, dark hair, small dark moustache, flat
      cheeks, good chin, grey eyes, small feet, guilty look....&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rose and went to the window. He stood there in sardonic fury.
      Congenital idiot&mdash;spidery congenital idiot! Seven months at fifteen
      pounds a week&mdash;to be tracked down as his own wife&rsquo;s lover!
      Guilty look! He threw the window open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; he said, and came back to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing his knees, he bent a supercilious glance on Mr. Polteed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if that&rsquo;s quite good enough,&rdquo; he said, drawling
      the words, &ldquo;with no name or address. I think you may let that lady
      have a rest, and take up our friend 47 at this end.&rdquo; Whether Polteed
      had spotted him he could not tell; but he had a mental vision of him in
      the midst of his cronies dissolved in inextinguishable laughter. &lsquo;Guilty
      look!&rsquo; Damnation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed said in a tone of urgency, almost of pathos: &ldquo;I assure
      you we have put it through sometimes on less than that. It&rsquo;s Paris,
      you know. Attractive woman living alone. Why not risk it, sir? We might
      screw it up a peg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had sudden insight. The fellow&rsquo;s professional zeal was
      stirred: &lsquo;Greatest triumph of my career; got a man his divorce
      through a visit to his own wife&rsquo;s bedroom! Something to talk of
      there, when I retire!&rsquo; And for one wild moment he thought: &lsquo;Why
      not?&rsquo; After all, hundreds of men of medium height had small feet and
      a guilty look!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not authorised to take any risk!&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;quite a pity! That other affair seemed
      very costive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. Please watch 47, and take care not to find a mare&rsquo;s
      nest. Good-morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed&rsquo;s eye glinted at the words &lsquo;mare&rsquo;s nest!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You shall be kept informed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames was alone again. The spidery, dirty, ridiculous business!
      Laying his arms on the table, he leaned his forehead on them. Full ten
      minutes he rested thus, till a managing clerk roused him with the draft
      prospectus of a new issue of shares, very desirable, in Manifold and
      Topping&rsquo;s. That afternoon he left work early and made his way to the
      Restaurant Bretagne. Only Madame Lamotte was in. Would Monsieur have tea
      with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were seated at right angles to each other in the little room, he
      said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a talk with you, Madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick lift of her clear brown eyes told him that she had long expected
      such words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to ask you something first: That young doctor&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      his name? Is there anything between him and Annette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her whole personality had become, as it were, like jet&mdash;clear-cut,
      black, hard, shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annette is young,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;so is monsieur le
      docteur. Between young people things move quickly; but Annette is a good
      daughter. Ah! what a jewel of a nature!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The least little smile twisted Soames&rsquo; lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing definite, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But definite&mdash;no, indeed! The young man is veree nice, but&mdash;what
      would you? There is no money at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her willow-patterned tea-cup; Soames did the same. Their eyes
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a married man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;living apart from my
      wife for many years. I am seeking to divorce her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamotte put down her cup. Indeed! What tragic things there were!
      The entire absence of sentiment in her inspired a queer species of
      contempt in Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a rich man,&rdquo; he added, fully conscious that the remark
      was not in good taste. &ldquo;It is useless to say more at present, but I
      think you understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame&rsquo;s eyes, so open that the whites showed above them, looked at
      him very straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ca&mdash;mais nous avons le temps!&rdquo; was all she said.
      &ldquo;Another little cup?&rdquo; Soames refused, and, taking his leave,
      walked westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got that off his mind; she would not let Annette commit herself
      with that cheerful young ass until...! But what chance of his ever being
      able to say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m free.&rsquo; What chance? The future had
      lost all semblance of reality. He felt like a fly, entangled in cobweb
      filaments, watching the desirable freedom of the air with pitiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was short of exercise, and wandered on to Kensington Gardens, and down
      Queen&rsquo;s Gate towards Chelsea. Perhaps she had gone back to her flat.
      That at all events he could find out. For since that last and most
      ignominious repulse his wounded self-respect had taken refuge again in the
      feeling that she must have a lover. He arrived before the little Mansions
      at the dinner-hour. No need to enquire! A grey-haired lady was watering
      the flower-boxes in her window. It was evidently let. And he walked slowly
      past again, along the river&mdash;an evening of clear, quiet beauty, all
      harmony and comfort, except within his heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;RICHMOND PARK
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the afternoon that Soames crossed to France a cablegram was received by
      Jolyon at Robin Hill:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son down with enteric no immediate danger will cable again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It reached a household already agitated by the imminent departure of June,
      whose berth was booked for the following day. She was, indeed, in the act
      of confiding Eric Cobbley and his family to her father&rsquo;s care when
      the message arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolution to become a Red Cross nurse, taken under stimulus of Jolly&rsquo;s
      enlistment, had been loyally fulfilled with the irritation and regret
      which all Forsytes feel at what curtails their individual liberties.
      Enthusiastic at first about the &lsquo;wonderfulness&rsquo; of the work,
      she had begun after a month to feel that she could train herself so much
      better than others could train her. And if Holly had not insisted on
      following her example, and being trained too, she must inevitably have
      &lsquo;cried off.&rsquo; The departure of Jolly and Val with their troop
      in April had further stiffened her failing resolve. But now, on the point
      of departure, the thought of leaving Eric Cobbley, with a wife and two
      children, adrift in the cold waters of an unappreciative world weighed on
      her so that she was still in danger of backing out. The reading of that
      cablegram, with its disquieting reality, clinched the matter. She saw
      herself already nursing Jolly&mdash;for of course they would let her nurse
      her own brother! Jolyon&mdash;ever wide and doubtful&mdash;had no such
      hope. Poor June!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could any Forsyte of her generation grasp how rude and brutal life was?
      Ever since he knew of his boy&rsquo;s arrival at Cape Town the thought of
      him had been a kind of recurrent sickness in Jolyon. He could not get
      reconciled to the feeling that Jolly was in danger all the time. The
      cablegram, grave though it was, was almost a relief. He was now safe from
      bullets, anyway. And yet&mdash;this enteric was a virulent disease! The
      Times was full of deaths therefrom. Why could he not be lying out there in
      that up-country hospital, and his boy safe at home? The un-Forsytean
      self-sacrifice of his three children, indeed, had quite bewildered Jolyon.
      He would eagerly change places with Jolly, because he loved his boy; but
      no such personal motive was influencing them. He could only think that it
      marked the decline of the Forsyte type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon Holly came out to him under the old oak-tree. She had
      grown up very much during these last months of hospital training away from
      home. And, seeing her approach, he thought: &lsquo;She has more sense than
      June, child though she is; more wisdom. Thank God she isn&rsquo;t going
      out.&rsquo; She had seated herself in the swing, very silent and still.
      &lsquo;She feels this,&rsquo; thought Jolyon, &lsquo;as much as I&rsquo;
      and, seeing her eyes fixed on him, he said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it to
      heart too much, my child. If he weren&rsquo;t ill, he might be in much
      greater danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly got out of the swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to tell you something, Dad. It was through me that Jolly
      enlisted and went out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were away in Paris, Val Dartie and I fell in love. We used
      to ride in Richmond Park; we got engaged. Jolly found it out, and thought
      he ought to stop it; so he dared Val to enlist. It was all my fault, Dad;
      and I want to go out too. Because if anything happens to either of them I
      should feel awful. Besides, I&rsquo;m just as much trained as June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon gazed at her in a stupefaction that was tinged with irony. So this
      was the answer to the riddle he had been asking himself; and his three
      children were Forsytes after all. Surely Holly might have told him all
      this before! But he smothered the sarcastic sayings on his lips.
      Tenderness to the young was perhaps the most sacred article of his belief.
      He had got, no doubt, what he deserved. Engaged! So this was why he had so
      lost touch with her! And to young Val Dartie&mdash;nephew of Soames&mdash;in
      the other camp! It was all terribly distasteful. He closed his easel, and
      set his drawing against the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told June?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she says she&rsquo;ll get me into her cabin somehow. It&rsquo;s
      a single cabin; but one of us could sleep on the floor. If you consent,
      she&rsquo;ll go up now and get permission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consent?&rsquo; thought Jolyon. &lsquo;Rather late in the day to
      ask for that!&rsquo; But again he checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young, my dear; they won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June knows some people that she helped to go to Cape Town. If they
      won&rsquo;t let me nurse yet, I could stay with them and go on training
      there. Let me go, Dad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon smiled because he could have cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never stop anyone from doing anything,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly flung her arms round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Dad, you are the best in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That means the worst,&rsquo; thought Jolyon. If he had ever doubted
      his creed of tolerance he did so then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not friendly with Val&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know Val, but Jolly didn&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly looked at the distance and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said Jolyon dryly, then catching the
      expression on her face, he kissed her, with the thought: &lsquo;Is
      anything more pathetic than the faith of the young?&rsquo; Unless he
      actually forbade her going it was obvious that he must make the best of
      it, so he went up to town with June. Whether due to her persistence, or
      the fact that the official they saw was an old school friend of Jolyon&rsquo;s,
      they obtained permission for Holly to share the single cabin. He took them
      to Surbiton station the following evening, and they duly slid away from
      him, provided with money, invalid foods, and those letters of credit
      without which Forsytes do not travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove back to Robin Hill under a brilliant sky to his late dinner,
      served with an added care by servants trying to show him that they
      sympathised, eaten with an added scrupulousness to show them that he
      appreciated their sympathy. But it was a real relief to get to his cigar
      on the terrace of flag-stones&mdash;cunningly chosen by young Bosinney for
      shape and colour&mdash;with night closing in around him, so beautiful a
      night, hardly whispering in the trees, and smelling so sweet that it made
      him ache. The grass was drenched with dew, and he kept to those
      flagstones, up and down, till presently it began to seem to him that he
      was one of three, not wheeling, but turning right about at each end, so
      that his father was always nearest to the house, and his son always
      nearest to the terrace edge. Each had an arm lightly within his arm; he
      dared not lift his hand to his cigar lest he should disturb them, and it
      burned away, dripping ash on him, till it dropped from his lips, at last,
      which were getting hot. They left him then, and his arms felt chilly.
      Three Jolyons in one Jolyon they had walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, counting the sounds&mdash;a carriage passing on the
      highroad, a distant train, the dog at Gage&rsquo;s farm, the whispering
      trees, the groom playing on his penny whistle. A multitude of stars up
      there&mdash;bright and silent, so far off! No moon as yet! Just enough
      light to show him the dark flags and swords of the iris flowers along the
      terrace edge&mdash;his favourite flower that had the night&rsquo;s own
      colour on its curving crumpled petals. He turned round to the house. Big,
      unlighted, not a soul beside himself to live in all that part of it. Stark
      loneliness! He could not go on living here alone. And yet, so long as
      there was beauty, why should a man feel lonely? The answer&mdash;as to
      some idiot&rsquo;s riddle&mdash;was: Because he did. The greater the
      beauty, the greater the loneliness, for at the back of beauty was harmony,
      and at the back of harmony was&mdash;union. Beauty could not comfort if
      the soul were out of it. The night, maddeningly lovely, with bloom of
      grapes on it in starshine, and the breath of grass and honey coming from
      it, he could not enjoy, while she who was to him the life of beauty, its
      embodiment and essence, was cut off from him, utterly cut off now, he
      felt, by honourable decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a poor fist of sleeping, striving too hard after that resignation
      which Forsytes find difficult to reach, bred to their own way and left so
      comfortably off by their fathers. But after dawn he dozed off, and soon
      was dreaming a strange dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on a stage with immensely high rich curtains&mdash;high as the very
      stars&mdash;stretching in a semi-circle from footlights to footlights. He
      himself was very small, a little black restless figure roaming up and
      down; and the odd thing was that he was not altogether himself, but Soames
      as well, so that he was not only experiencing but watching. This figure of
      himself and Soames was trying to find a way out through the curtains,
      which, heavy and dark, kept him in. Several times he had crossed in front
      of them before he saw with delight a sudden narrow rift&mdash;a tall chink
      of beauty the colour of iris flowers, like a glimpse of Paradise, remote,
      ineffable. Stepping quickly forward to pass into it, he found the curtains
      closing before him. Bitterly disappointed he&mdash;or was it Soames?&mdash;moved
      on, and there was the chink again through the parted curtains, which again
      closed too soon. This went on and on and he never got through till he woke
      with the word &ldquo;Irene&rdquo; on his lips. The dream disturbed him
      badly, especially that identification of himself with Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, finding it impossible to work, he spent hours riding Jolly&rsquo;s
      horse in search of fatigue. And on the second day he made up his mind to
      move to London and see if he could not get permission to follow his
      daughters to South Africa. He had just begun to pack the following morning
      when he received this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GREEN HOTEL,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RICHMOND. &ldquo;MY DEAR JOLYON,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be surprised to see how near I am to you. Paris became
      impossible&mdash;and I have come here to be within reach of your advice. I
      would so love to see you again. Since you left Paris I don&rsquo;t think I
      have met anyone I could really talk to. Is all well with you and with your
      boy? No one knows, I think, that I am here at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IRENE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene within three miles of him!&mdash;and again in flight! He stood with
      a very queer smile on his lips. This was more than he had bargained for!
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon he set out on foot across Richmond Park, and as he went along,
      he thought: &lsquo;Richmond Park! By Jove, it suits us Forsytes!&rsquo;
      Not that Forsytes lived there&mdash;nobody lived there save royalty,
      rangers, and the deer&mdash;but in Richmond Park Nature was allowed to go
      so far and no further, putting up a brave show of being natural, seeming
      to say: &lsquo;Look at my instincts&mdash;they are almost passions, very
      nearly out of hand, but not quite, of course; the very hub of possession
      is to possess oneself.&rsquo; Yes! Richmond Park possessed itself, even on
      that bright day of June, with arrowy cuckoos shifting the tree-points of
      their calls, and the wood doves announcing high summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Green Hotel, which Jolyon entered at one o&rsquo;clock, stood nearly
      opposite that more famous hostelry, the Crown and Sceptre; it was modest,
      highly respectable, never out of cold beef, gooseberry tart, and a dowager
      or two, so that a carriage and pair was almost always standing before the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a room draped in chintz so slippery as to forbid all emotion, Irene was
      sitting on a piano stool covered with crewel work, playing &lsquo;Hansel
      and Gretel&rsquo; out of an old score. Above her on a wall, not yet
      Morris-papered, was a print of the Queen on a pony, amongst deer-hounds,
      Scotch caps, and slain stags; beside her in a pot on the window-sill was a
      white and rosy fuchsia. The Victorianism of the room almost talked; and in
      her clinging frock Irene seemed to Jolyon like Venus emerging from the
      shell of the past century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the proprietor had eyes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he would show
      you the door; you have broken through his decorations.&rdquo; Thus lightly
      he smothered up an emotional moment. Having eaten cold beef, pickled
      walnut, gooseberry tart, and drunk stone-bottle ginger-beer, they walked
      into the Park, and light talk was succeeded by the silence Jolyon had
      dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me about Paris,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve been shadowed for a long time; one gets used to
      that. But then Soames came. By the little Niobe&mdash;the same story;
      would I go back to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken without raising her eyes, but she looked up now. Those dark
      eyes clinging to his said as no words could have: &lsquo;I have come to an
      end; if you want me, here I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For sheer emotional intensity had he ever&mdash;old as he was&mdash;passed
      through such a moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      The words: &lsquo;Irene, I adore you!&rsquo; almost escaped him. Then,
      with a clearness of which he would not have believed mental vision
      capable, he saw Jolly lying with a white face turned to a white wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy is very ill out there,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene slipped her arm through his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk on; I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No miserable explanation to attempt! She had understood! And they walked
      on among the bracken, knee-high already, between the rabbit-holes and the
      oak-trees, talking of Jolly. He left her two hours later at the Richmond
      Hill Gate, and turned towards home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows of my feeling for her, then,&rsquo; he thought. Of
      course! One could not keep knowledge of that from such a woman!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;OVER THE RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolly was tired to death of dreams. They had left him now too wan and weak
      to dream again; left him to lie torpid, faintly remembering far-off
      things; just able to turn his eyes and gaze through the window near his
      cot at the trickle of river running by in the sands, at the straggling
      milk-bush of the Karoo beyond. He knew what the Karoo was now, even if he
      had not seen a Boer roll over like a rabbit, or heard the whine of flying
      bullets. This pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder.
      A thirsty day and a rash drink, or perhaps a tainted fruit&mdash;who knew?
      Not he, who had not even strength left to grudge the evil thing its
      victory&mdash;just enough to know that there were many lying here with
      him, that he was sore with frenzied dreaming; just enough to watch that
      thread of river and be able to remember faintly those far-away things....
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was nearly down. It would be cooler soon. He would have liked to
      know the time&mdash;to feel his old watch, so butter-smooth, to hear the
      repeater strike. It would have been friendly, home-like. He had not even
      strength to remember that the old watch was last wound the day he began to
      lie here. The pulse of his brain beat so feebly that faces which came and
      went, nurse&rsquo;s, doctor&rsquo;s, orderly&rsquo;s, were
      indistinguishable, just one indifferent face; and the words spoken about
      him meant all the same thing, and that almost nothing. Those things he
      used to do, though far and faint, were more distinct&mdash;walking past
      the foot of the old steps at Harrow &lsquo;bill&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Here,
      sir! Here, sir!&rsquo;&mdash;wrapping boots in the Westminster Gazette,
      greenish paper, shining boots&mdash;grandfather coming from somewhere dark&mdash;a
      smell of earth&mdash;the mushroom house! Robin Hill! Burying poor old
      Balthasar in the leaves! Dad! Home....
    </p>
    <p>
      Consciousness came again with noticing that the river had no water in it&mdash;someone
      was speaking too. Want anything? No. What could one want? Too weak to want&mdash;only
      to hear his watch strike....
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly! She wouldn&rsquo;t bowl properly. Oh! Pitch them up! Not sneaks!...
      &lsquo;Back her, Two and Bow!&rsquo; He was Two!... Consciousness came
      once more with a sense of the violet dusk outside, and a rising blood-red
      crescent moon. His eyes rested on it fascinated; in the long minutes of
      brain-nothingness it went moving up and up....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going, doctor!&rdquo; Not pack boots again? Never?
      &lsquo;Mind your form, Two!&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t cry! Go quietly&mdash;over
      the river&mdash;sleep!... Dark? If somebody would&mdash;strike&mdash;his&mdash;watch!...

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;SOAMES ACTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      A sealed letter in the handwriting of Mr. Polteed remained unopened in
      Soames&rsquo; pocket throughout two hours of sustained attention to the
      affairs of the &lsquo;New Colliery Company,&rsquo; which, declining almost
      from the moment of old Jolyon&rsquo;s retirement from the Chairmanship,
      had lately run down so fast that there was now nothing for it but a
      &lsquo;winding-up.&rsquo; He took the letter out to lunch at his City
      Club, sacred to him for the meals he had eaten there with his father in
      the early seventies, when James used to like him to come and see for
      himself the nature of his future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in a remote corner before a plate of roast mutton and mashed potato,
      he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In accordance with your suggestion we have duly taken the matter up
      at the other end with gratifying results. Observation of 47 has enabled us
      to locate 17 at the Green Hotel, Richmond. The two have been observed to
      meet daily during the past week in Richmond Park. Nothing absolutely
      crucial has so far been notified. But in conjunction with what we had from
      Paris at the beginning of the year, I am confident we could now satisfy
      the Court. We shall, of course, continue to watch the matter until we hear
      from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very faithfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CLAUD POLTEED.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames read it through twice and beckoned to the waiter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this away; it&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I bring you some more, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Get me some coffee in the other room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, paying for what he had not eaten, he went out, passing two
      acquaintances without sign of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Satisfy the Court!&rsquo; he thought, sitting at a little round
      marble table with the coffee before him. That fellow Jolyon! He poured out
      his coffee, sweetened and drank it. He would disgrace him in the eyes of
      his own children! And rising, with that resolution hot within him, he
      found for the first time the inconvenience of being his own solicitor. He
      could not treat this scandalous matter in his own office. He must commit
      the soul of his private dignity to a stranger, some other professional
      dealer in family dishonour. Who was there he could go to? Linkman and
      Laver in Budge Row, perhaps&mdash;reliable, not too conspicuous, only
      nodding acquaintances. But before he saw them he must see Polteed again.
      But at this thought Soames had a moment of sheer weakness. To part with
      his secret? How find the words? How subject himself to contempt and secret
      laughter? Yet, after all, the fellow knew already&mdash;oh yes, he knew!
      And, feeling that he must finish with it now, he took a cab into the West
      End.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this hot weather the window of Mr. Polteed&rsquo;s room was positively
      open, and the only precaution was a wire gauze, preventing the intrusion
      of flies. Two or three had tried to come in, and been caught, so that they
      seemed to be clinging there with the intention of being devoured
      presently. Mr. Polteed, following the direction of his client&rsquo;s eye,
      rose apologetically and closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Posing ass!&rsquo; thought Soames. Like all who fundamentally
      believe in themselves he was rising to the occasion, and, with his little
      sideway smile, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had your letter. I&rsquo;m going
      to act. I suppose you know who the lady you&rsquo;ve been watching really
      is?&rdquo; Mr. Polteed&rsquo;s expression at that moment was a
      masterpiece. It so clearly said: &lsquo;Well, what do you think? But mere
      professional knowledge, I assure you&mdash;pray forgive it!&rsquo; He made
      a little half airy movement with his hand, as who should say: &lsquo;Such
      things&mdash;such things will happen to us all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Soames, moistening his lips: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      no need to say more. I&rsquo;m instructing Linkman and Laver of Budge Row
      to act for me. I don&rsquo;t want to hear your evidence, but kindly make
      your report to them at five o&rsquo;clock, and continue to observe the
      utmost secrecy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polteed half closed his eyes, as if to comply at once. &ldquo;My dear
      sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you convinced,&rdquo; asked Soames with sudden energy, &ldquo;that
      there is enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The faintest movement occurred to Mr. Polteed&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can risk it,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;with what we have, and
      human nature, you can risk it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rose. &ldquo;You will ask for Mr. Linkman. Thanks; don&rsquo;t get
      up.&rdquo; He could not bear Mr. Polteed to slide as usual between him and
      the door. In the sunlight of Piccadilly he wiped his forehead. This had
      been the worst of it&mdash;he could stand the strangers better. And he
      went back into the City to do what still lay before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening in Park Lane, watching his father dine, he was overwhelmed by
      his old longing for a son&mdash;a son, to watch him eat as he went down
      the years, to be taken on his knee as James on a time had been wont to
      take him; a son of his own begetting, who could understand him because he
      was the same flesh and blood&mdash;understand, and comfort him, and become
      more rich and cultured than himself because he would start even better
      off. To get old&mdash;like that thin, grey wiry-frail figure sitting there&mdash;and
      be quite alone with possessions heaping up around him; to take no interest
      in anything because it had no future and must pass away from him to hands
      and mouths and eyes for whom he cared no jot! No! He would force it
      through now, and be free to marry, and have a son to care for him before
      he grew to be like the old old man his father, wistfully watching now his
      sweetbread, now his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that mood he went up to bed. But, lying warm between those fine linen
      sheets of Emily&rsquo;s providing, he was visited by memories and torture.
      Visions of Irene, almost the solid feeling of her body, beset him. Why had
      he ever been fool enough to see her again, and let this flood back on him
      so that it was pain to think of her with that fellow&mdash;that stealing
      fellow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;A SUMMER DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      His boy was seldom absent from Jolyon&rsquo;s mind in the days which
      followed the first walk with Irene in Richmond Park. No further news had
      come; enquiries at the War Office elicited nothing; nor could he expect to
      hear from June and Holly for three weeks at least. In these days he felt
      how insufficient were his memories of Jolly, and what an amateur of a
      father he had been. There was not a single memory in which anger played a
      part; not one reconciliation, because there had never been a rupture; nor
      one heart-to-heart confidence, not even when Jolly&rsquo;s mother died.
      Nothing but half-ironical affection. He had been too afraid of committing
      himself in any direction, for fear of losing his liberty, or interfering
      with that of his boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in Irene&rsquo;s presence had he relief, highly complicated by the
      ever-growing perception of how divided he was between her and his son.
      With Jolly was bound up all that sense of continuity and social creed of
      which he had drunk deeply in his youth and again during his boy&rsquo;s
      public school and varsity life&mdash;all that sense of not going back on
      what father and son expected of each other. With Irene was bound up all
      his delight in beauty and in Nature. And he seemed to know less and less
      which was the stronger within him. From such sentimental paralysis he was
      rudely awakened, however, one afternoon, just as he was starting off to
      Richmond, by a young man with a bicycle and a face oddly familiar, who
      came forward faintly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jolyon Forsyte? Thank you!&rdquo; Placing an envelope in Jolyon&rsquo;s
      hand he wheeled off the path and rode away. Bewildered, Jolyon opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admiralty Probate and Divorce, Forsyte v. Forsyte and Forsyte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sensation of shame and disgust was followed by the instant reaction
      &lsquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the very thing you want, and you don&rsquo;t like
      it!&rsquo; But she must have had one too; and he must go to her at once.
      He turned things over as he went along. It was an ironical business. For,
      whatever the Scriptures said about the heart, it took more than mere
      longings to satisfy the law. They could perfectly well defend this suit,
      or at least in good faith try to. But the idea of doing so revolted
      Jolyon. If not her lover in deed he was in desire, and he knew that she
      was ready to come to him. Her face had told him so. Not that he
      exaggerated her feeling for him. She had had her grand passion, and he
      could not expect another from her at his age. But she had trust in him,
      affection for him, and must feel that he would be a refuge. Surely she
      would not ask him to defend the suit, knowing that he adored her! Thank
      Heaven she had not that maddening British conscientiousness which refused
      happiness for the sake of refusing! She must rejoice at this chance of
      being free after seventeen years of death in life! As to publicity, the
      fat was in the fire! To defend the suit would not take away the slur.
      Jolyon had all the proper feeling of a Forsyte whose privacy is
      threatened: If he was to be hung by the Law, by all means let it be for a
      sheep! Moreover the notion of standing in a witness box and swearing to
      the truth that no gesture, not even a word of love had passed between them
      seemed to him more degrading than to take the tacit stigma of being an
      adulterer&mdash;more truly degrading, considering the feeling in his
      heart, and just as bad and painful for his children. The thought of
      explaining away, if he could, before a judge and twelve average
      Englishmen, their meetings in Paris, and the walks in Richmond Park,
      horrified him. The brutality and hypocritical censoriousness of the whole
      process; the probability that they would not be believed&mdash;the mere
      vision of her, whom he looked on as the embodiment of Nature and of
      Beauty, standing there before all those suspicious, gloating eyes was
      hideous to him. No, no! To defend a suit only made a London holiday, and
      sold the newspapers. A thousand times better accept what Soames and the
      gods had sent!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; he thought honestly, &lsquo;who knows whether, even
      for my boy&rsquo;s sake, I could have stood this state of things much
      longer? Anyway, her neck will be out of chancery at last!&rsquo; Thus
      absorbed, he was hardly conscious of the heavy heat. The sky had become
      overcast, purplish with little streaks of white. A heavy heat-drop plashed
      a little star pattern in the dust of the road as he entered the Park.
      &lsquo;Phew!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;thunder! I hope she&rsquo;s not
      come to meet me; there&rsquo;s a ducking up there!&rsquo; But at that very
      minute he saw Irene coming towards the Gate. &lsquo;We must scuttle back
      to Robin Hill,&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The storm had passed over the Poultry at four o&rsquo;clock, bringing
      welcome distraction to the clerks in every office. Soames was drinking a
      cup of tea when a note was brought in to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forsyte v. Forsyte and Forsyte
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In accordance with your instructions, we beg to inform you that we
      personally served the respondent and co-respondent in this suit to-day, at
      Richmond, and Robin Hill, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LINKMAN AND LAVER.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes Soames stared at that note. Ever since he had given those
      instructions he had been tempted to annul them. It was so scandalous, such
      a general disgrace! The evidence, too, what he had heard of it, had never
      seemed to him conclusive; somehow, he believed less and less that those
      two had gone all lengths. But this, of course, would drive them to it; and
      he suffered from the thought. That fellow to have her love, where he had
      failed! Was it too late? Now that they had been brought up sharp by
      service of this petition, had he not a lever with which he could force
      them apart? &lsquo;But if I don&rsquo;t act at once,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;it will be too late, now they&rsquo;ve had this thing. I&rsquo;ll
      go and see him; I&rsquo;ll go down!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, sick with nervous anxiety, he sent out for one of the &lsquo;new-fangled&rsquo;
      motor-cabs. It might take a long time to run that fellow to ground, and
      Goodness knew what decision they might come to after such a shock! &lsquo;If
      I were a theatrical ass,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I suppose I should be
      taking a horse-whip or a pistol or something!&rsquo; He took instead a
      bundle of papers in the case of &lsquo;Magentie versus Wake,&rsquo;
      intending to read them on the way down. He did not even open them, but sat
      quite still, jolted and jarred, unconscious of the draught down the back
      of his neck, or the smell of petrol. He must be guided by the fellow&rsquo;s
      attitude; the great thing was to keep his head!
    </p>
    <p>
      London had already begun to disgorge its workers as he neared Putney
      Bridge; the ant-heap was on the move outwards. What a lot of ants, all
      with a living to get, holding on by their eyelids in the great scramble!
      Perhaps for the first time in his life Soames thought: &lsquo;I could let
      go if I liked! Nothing could touch me; I could snap my fingers, live as I
      wished&mdash;enjoy myself!&rsquo; No! One could not live as he had and
      just drop it all&mdash;settle down in Capua, to spend the money and
      reputation he had made. A man&rsquo;s life was what he possessed and
      sought to possess. Only fools thought otherwise&mdash;fools, and
      socialists, and libertines!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab was passing villas now, going a great pace. &lsquo;Fifteen miles
      an hour, I should think!&rsquo; he mused; &lsquo;this&rsquo;ll take people
      out of town to live!&rsquo; and he thought of its bearing on the portions
      of London owned by his father&mdash;he himself had never taken to that
      form of investment, the gambler in him having all the outlet needed in his
      pictures. And the cab sped on, down the hill past Wimbledon Common. This
      interview! Surely a man of fifty-two with grown-up children, and hung on
      the line, would not be reckless. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t want to disgrace
      the family,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;he was as fond of his father as I am
      of mine, and they were brothers. That woman brings destruction&mdash;what
      is it in her? I&rsquo;ve never known.&rsquo; The cab branched off, along
      the side of a wood, and he heard a late cuckoo calling, almost the first
      he had heard that year. He was now almost opposite the site he had
      originally chosen for his house, and which had been so unceremoniously
      rejected by Bosinney in favour of his own choice. He began passing his
      handkerchief over his face and hands, taking deep breaths to give him
      steadiness. &lsquo;Keep one&rsquo;s head,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;keep
      one&rsquo;s head!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab turned in at the drive which might have been his own, and the
      sound of music met him. He had forgotten the fellow&rsquo;s daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be out again directly,&rdquo; he said to the driver, &ldquo;or
      I may be kept some time&rdquo;; and he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the maid through the curtains into the inner hall, he felt
      relieved that the impact of this meeting would be broken by June or Holly,
      whichever was playing in there, so that with complete surprise he saw
      Irene at the piano, and Jolyon sitting in an armchair listening. They both
      stood up. Blood surged into Soames&rsquo; brain, and all his resolution to
      be guided by this or that left him utterly. The look of his farmer
      forbears&mdash;dogged Forsytes down by the sea, from &lsquo;Superior
      Dosset&rsquo; back&mdash;grinned out of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the fellow murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is hardly the place&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go to the study, if you
      don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; And they both passed him through the curtain
      opening. In the little room to which he followed them, Irene stood by the
      open window, and the &lsquo;fellow&rsquo; close to her by a big chair.
      Soames pulled the door to behind him with a slam; the sound carried him
      back all those years to the day when he had shut out Jolyon&mdash;shut him
      out for meddling with his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what have you to say for yourselves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow had the effrontery to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we have received to-day has taken away your right to ask. I
      should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;you think so! I came to tell you
      that I&rsquo;ll divorce her with every circumstance of disgrace to you
      both, unless you swear to keep clear of each other from now on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished at his fluency, because his mind was stammering and his
      hands twitching. Neither of them answered; but their faces seemed to him
      as if contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&mdash;Irene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips moved, but Jolyon laid his hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her alone!&rdquo; said Soames furiously. &ldquo;Irene, will you
      swear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! and you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then you&rsquo;re guilty, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, guilty.&rdquo; It was Irene speaking in that serene voice,
      with that unreached air which had maddened him so often; and, carried
      beyond himself, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a devil&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out! Leave this house, or I&rsquo;ll do you an injury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That fellow to talk of injuries! Did he know how near his throat was to
      being scragged?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trustee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;embezzling trust property! A
      thief, stealing his cousin&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me what you like. You have chosen your part, we have chosen
      ours. Go out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had brought a weapon Soames might have used it at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you pay!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that deadly turning of the meaning of his speech by the son of him who
      had nicknamed him &lsquo;the man of property,&rsquo; Soames stood glaring.
      It was ridiculous!
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were, kept from violence by some secret force. No blow
      possible, no words to meet the case. But he could not, did not know how to
      turn and go away. His eyes fastened on Irene&rsquo;s face&mdash;the last
      time he would ever see that fatal face&mdash;the last time, no doubt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll treat him
      as you treated me&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her wince, and with a sensation not quite triumph, not quite
      relief, he wrenched open the door, passed out through the hall, and got
      into his cab. He lolled against the cushion with his eyes shut. Never in
      his life had he been so near to murderous violence, never so thrown away
      the restraint which was his second nature. He had a stripped and naked
      feeling, as if all virtue had gone out of him&mdash;life meaningless,
      mind-striking work. Sunlight streamed in on him, but he felt cold. The
      scene he had passed through had gone from him already, what was before him
      would not materialise, he could catch on to nothing; and he felt
      frightened, as if he had been hanging over the edge of a precipice, as if
      with another turn of the screw sanity would have failed him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      not fit for it,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not fit for it.&rsquo; The cab sped on, and in mechanical procession
      trees, houses, people passed, but had no significance. &lsquo;I feel very
      queer,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a Turkish bath.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      been very near to something. It won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; The cab whirred its
      way back over the bridge, up the Fulham Road, along the Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Hammam,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious that on so warm a summer day, heat should be so comforting!
      Crossing into the hot room he met George Forsyte coming out, red and
      glistening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;what are you training for? You&rsquo;ve
      not got much superfluous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffoon! Soames passed him with his sideway smile. Lying back, rubbing his
      skin uneasily for the first signs of perspiration, he thought: &lsquo;Let
      them laugh! I won&rsquo;t feel anything! I can&rsquo;t stand violence! It&rsquo;s
      not good for me!&rsquo;
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;A SUMMER NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames left dead silence in the little study. &ldquo;Thank you for that
      good lie,&rdquo; said Jolyon suddenly. &ldquo;Come out&mdash;the air in
      here is not what it was!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of a long high southerly wall on which were trained peach-trees
      the two walked up and down in silence. Old Jolyon had planted some
      cupressus-trees, at intervals, between this grassy terrace and the dipping
      meadow full of buttercups and ox-eyed daisies; for twelve years they had
      flourished, till their dark spiral shapes had quite a look of Italy. Birds
      fluttered softly in the wet shrubbery; the swallows swooped past, with a
      steel-blue sheen on their swift little bodies; the grass felt springy
      beneath the feet, its green refreshed; butterflies chased each other.
      After that painful scene the quiet of Nature was wonderfully poignant.
      Under the sun-soaked wall ran a narrow strip of garden-bed full of
      mignonette and pansies, and from the bees came a low hum in which all
      other sounds were set&mdash;the mooing of a cow deprived of her calf, the
      calling of a cuckoo from an elm-tree at the bottom of the meadow. Who
      would have thought that behind them, within ten miles, London began&mdash;that
      London of the Forsytes, with its wealth, its misery; its dirt and noise;
      its jumbled stone isles of beauty, its grey sea of hideous brick and
      stucco? That London which had seen Irene&rsquo;s early tragedy, and Jolyon&rsquo;s
      own hard days; that web; that princely workhouse of the possessive
      instinct!
    </p>
    <p>
      And while they walked Jolyon pondered those words: &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll
      treat him as you treated me.&rsquo; That would depend on himself. Could he
      trust himself? Did Nature permit a Forsyte not to make a slave of what he
      adored? Could beauty be confided to him? Or should she not be just a
      visitor, coming when she would, possessed for moments which passed, to
      return only at her own choosing? &lsquo;We are a breed of spoilers!&rsquo;
      thought Jolyon, &lsquo;close and greedy; the bloom of life is not safe
      with us. Let her come to me as she will, when she will, not at all if she
      will not. Let me be just her stand-by, her perching-place; never-never her
      cage!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the chink of beauty in his dream. Was he to pass through the
      curtains now and reach her? Was the rich stuff of many possessions, the
      close encircling fabric of the possessive instinct walling in that little
      black figure of himself, and Soames&mdash;was it to be rent so that he
      could pass through into his vision, find there something not of the senses
      only? &lsquo;Let me,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;ah! let me only know how
      not to grasp and destroy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at dinner there were plans to be made. To-night she would go back to
      the hotel, but tomorrow he would take her up to London. He must instruct
      his solicitor&mdash;Jack Herring. Not a finger must be raised to hinder
      the process of the Law. Damages exemplary, judicial strictures, costs,
      what they liked&mdash;let it go through at the first moment, so that her
      neck might be out of chancery at last! To-morrow he would see Herring&mdash;they
      would go and see him together. And then&mdash;abroad, leaving no doubt, no
      difficulty about evidence, making the lie she had told into the truth. He
      looked round at her; and it seemed to his adoring eyes that more than a
      woman was sitting there. The spirit of universal beauty, deep, mysterious,
      which the old painters, Titian, Giorgione, Botticelli, had known how to
      capture and transfer to the faces of their women&mdash;this flying beauty
      seemed to him imprinted on her brow, her hair, her lips, and in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is to be mine!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It frightens me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they went out on to the terrace to have coffee. They sat
      there long, the evening was so lovely, watching the summer night come very
      slowly on. It was still warm and the air smelled of lime blossom&mdash;early
      this summer. Two bats were flighting with the faint mysterious little
      noise they make. He had placed the chairs in front of the study window,
      and moths flew past to visit the discreet light in there. There was no
      wind, and not a whisper in the old oak-tree twenty yards away! The moon
      rose from behind the copse, nearly full; and the two lights struggled,
      till moonlight conquered, changing the colour and quality of all the
      garden, stealing along the flagstones, reaching their feet, climbing up,
      changing their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jolyon at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be tired,
      dear; we&rsquo;d better start. The maid will show you Holly&rsquo;s room,&rdquo;
      and he rang the study bell. The maid who came handed him a telegram.
      Watching her take Irene away, he thought: &lsquo;This must have come an
      hour or more ago, and she didn&rsquo;t bring it out to us! That shows!
      Well, we&rsquo;ll be hung for a sheep soon!&rsquo; And, opening the
      telegram, he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JOLYON FORSYTE, Robin Hill.&mdash;Your son passed painlessly away
      on June 20th. Deep sympathy&rdquo;&mdash;some name unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped it, spun round, stood motionless. The moon shone in on him; a
      moth flew in his face. The first day of all that he had not thought almost
      ceaselessly of Jolly. He went blindly towards the window, struck against
      the old armchair&mdash;his father&rsquo;s&mdash;and sank down on to the
      arm of it. He sat there huddled&rsquo; forward, staring into the night.
      Gone out like a candle flame; far from home, from love, all by himself, in
      the dark! His boy! From a little chap always so good to him&mdash;so
      friendly! Twenty years old, and cut down like grass&mdash;to have no life
      at all! &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know him,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and
      he didn&rsquo;t know me; but we loved each other. It&rsquo;s only love
      that matters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To die out there&mdash;lonely&mdash;wanting them&mdash;wanting home! This
      seemed to his Forsyte heart more painful, more pitiful than death itself.
      No shelter, no protection, no love at the last! And all the deeply rooted
      clanship in him, the family feeling and essential clinging to his own
      flesh and blood which had been so strong in old Jolyon was so strong in
      all the Forsytes&mdash;felt outraged, cut, and torn by his boy&rsquo;s
      lonely passing. Better far if he had died in battle, without time to long
      for them to come to him, to call out for them, perhaps, in his delirium!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had passed behind the oak-tree now, endowing it with uncanny
      life, so that it seemed watching him&mdash;the oak-tree his boy had been
      so fond of climbing, out of which he had once fallen and hurt himself, and
      hadn&rsquo;t cried!
    </p>
    <p>
      The door creaked. He saw Irene come in, pick up the telegram and read it.
      He heard the faint rustle of her dress. She sank on her knees close to
      him, and he forced himself to smile at her. She stretched up her arms and
      drew his head down on her shoulder. The perfume and warmth of her
      encircled him; her presence gained slowly his whole being.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;JAMES IN WAITING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sweated to serenity, Soames dined at the Remove and turned his face toward
      Park Lane. His father had been unwell lately. This would have to be kept
      from him! Never till that moment had he realised how much the dread of
      bringing James&rsquo; grey hairs down with sorrow to the grave had counted
      with him; how intimately it was bound up with his own shrinking from
      scandal. His affection for his father, always deep, had increased of late
      years with the knowledge that James looked on him as the real prop of his
      decline. It seemed pitiful that one who had been so careful all his life
      and done so much for the family name&mdash;so that it was almost a byword
      for solid, wealthy respectability&mdash;should at his last gasp have to
      see it in all the newspapers. This was like lending a hand to Death, that
      final enemy of Forsytes. &lsquo;I must tell mother,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;and when it comes on, we must keep the papers from him somehow. He
      sees hardly anyone.&rsquo; Letting himself in with his latchkey, he was
      beginning to ascend he stairs when he became conscious of commotion on the
      second-floor landing. His mother&rsquo;s voice was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, James, you&rsquo;ll catch cold. Why can&rsquo;t you wait
      quietly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s answering
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait? I&rsquo;m always waiting. Why doesn&rsquo;t he come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can speak to him to-morrow morning, instead of making a guy of
      yourself on the landing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go up to bed, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I shan&rsquo;t
      sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come back to bed, James.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um! I might die before to-morrow morning for all you can tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t have to wait till to-morrow morning; I&rsquo;ll go
      down and bring him up. Don&rsquo;t fuss!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go&mdash;always so cock-a-hoop. He mayn&rsquo;t come in
      at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he doesn&rsquo;t come in you won&rsquo;t catch him by
      standing out here in your dressing-gown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames rounded the last bend and came in sight of his father&rsquo;s tall
      figure wrapped in a brown silk quilted gown, stooping over the balustrade
      above. Light fell on his silvery hair and whiskers, investing his head
      with, a sort of halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; he heard him say in a voice which sounded
      injured, and his mother&rsquo;s comfortable answer from the bedroom door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Come in, and I&rsquo;ll brush your hair.&rdquo;
      James extended a thin, crooked finger, oddly like the beckoning of a
      skeleton, and passed through the doorway of his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; thought Soames. &lsquo;What has he got hold of
      now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was sitting before the dressing-table sideways to the mirror,
      while Emily slowly passed two silver-backed brushes through and through
      his hair. She would do this several times a day, for it had on him
      something of the effect produced on a cat by scratching between its ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stroked his shoulder, and, taking up a silver button-hook, examined
      the mark on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re looking better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say something. Your mother hasn&rsquo;t heard.&rdquo; He
      announced Emily&rsquo;s ignorance of what he hadn&rsquo;t told her, as if
      it were a grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s been in a great state all the evening. I&rsquo;m
      sure I don&rsquo;t know what about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint &lsquo;whisk-whisk&rsquo; of the brushes continued the soothing
      of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you know nothing,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Soames can tell me.&rdquo;
      And, fixing his grey eyes, in which there was a look of strain,
      uncomfortable to watch, on his son, he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting on, Soames. At my age I can&rsquo;t tell. I might
      die any time. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of money. There&rsquo;s Rachel and
      Cicely got no children; and Val&rsquo;s out there&mdash;that chap his
      father will get hold of all he can. And somebody&rsquo;ll pick up Imogen,
      I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames listened vaguely&mdash;he had heard all this before. Whish-whish!
      went the brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; said Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo; cried James; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m
      coming to that.&rdquo; And again his eyes strained pitifully at Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, my boy,&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;you ought
      to get a divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That word, from those of all lips, was almost too much for Soames&rsquo;
      composure. His eyes reconcentrated themselves quickly on the buttonhook,
      and as if in apology James hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s become of her&mdash;they say she&rsquo;s
      abroad. Your Uncle Swithin used to admire her&mdash;he was a funny fellow.&rdquo;
      (So he always alluded to his dead twin-&rsquo;.he Stout and the Lean of
      it,&rsquo; they had been called.) &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t be alone, I
      should say.&rdquo; And with that summing-up of the effect of beauty on
      human nature, he was silent, watching his son with eyes doubting as a bird&rsquo;s.
      Soames, too, was silent. Whish-whish went the brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, James! Soames knows best. It&rsquo;s his &lsquo;business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said James, and the word came from deep down; &ldquo;but
      there&rsquo;s all my money, and there&rsquo;s his&mdash;who&rsquo;s it to
      go to? And when he dies the name goes out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames replaced the button-hook on the lace and pink silk of the
      dressing-table coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name?&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;there are all the other
      Forsytes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if that helped me,&rdquo; muttered James. &ldquo;I shall be in
      my grave, and there&rsquo;ll be nobody, unless he marries again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; said Soames quietly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      getting a divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; eyes almost started from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There! nobody tells me anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;who would have imagined you wanted
      it? My dear boy, that is a surprise, after all these years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a scandal,&rdquo; muttered James, as if to himself;
      &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help that. Don&rsquo;t brush so hard. When&rsquo;ll
      it come on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the Long Vacation; it&rsquo;s not defended.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; lips moved in secret calculation. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t live
      to see my grandson,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily ceased brushing. &ldquo;Of course you will, James. Soames will be as
      quick as he can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, till James reached out his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! let&rsquo;s have the eau-de-Cologne,&rdquo; and, putting it
      to his nose, he moved his forehead in the direction of his son. Soames
      bent over and kissed that brow just where the hair began. A relaxing
      quiver passed over James&rsquo; face, as though the wheels of anxiety
      within were running down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to bed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want
      to see the papers when that comes. They&rsquo;re a morbid lot; I can&rsquo;t
      pay attention to them, I&rsquo;m too old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Queerly affected, Soames went to the door; he heard his father say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;ll say a prayer in bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And his mother answering
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, James; it&rsquo;ll be ever so much more comfy.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;OUT OF THE WEB
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Forsyte &lsquo;Change the announcement of Jolly&rsquo;s death, among a
      batch of troopers, caused mixed sensation. Strange to read that Jolyon
      Forsyte (fifth of the name in direct descent) had died of disease in the
      service of his country, and not be able to feel it personally. It revived
      the old grudge against his father for having estranged himself. For such
      was still the prestige of old Jolyon that the other Forsytes could never
      quite feel, as might have been expected, that it was they who had cut off
      his descendants for irregularity. The news increased, of course, the
      interest and anxiety about Val; but then Val&rsquo;s name was Dartie, and
      even if he were killed in battle or got the Victoria Cross, it would not
      be at all the same as if his name were Forsyte. Not even casualty or glory
      to the Haymans would be really satisfactory. Family pride felt defrauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the rumour arose, then, that &lsquo;something very dreadful, my dear,&rsquo;
      was pending, no one, least of all Soames, could tell, secret as he kept
      everything. Possibly some eye had seen &lsquo;Forsyte v. Forsyte and
      Forsyte,&rsquo; in the cause list; and had added it to &lsquo;Irene in
      Paris with a fair beard.&rsquo; Possibly some wall at Park Lane had ears.
      The fact remained that it was known&mdash;whispered among the old,
      discussed among the young&mdash;that family pride must soon receive a
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, paying one, of his Sunday visits to Timothy&rsquo;s&mdash;paying
      it with the feeling that after the suit came on he would be paying no more&mdash;felt
      knowledge in the air as he came in. Nobody, of course, dared speak of it
      before him, but each of the four other Forsytes present held their breath,
      aware that nothing could prevent Aunt Juley from making them all
      uncomfortable. She looked so piteously at Soames, she checked herself on
      the point of speech so often, that Aunt Hester excused herself and said
      she must go and bathe Timothy&rsquo;s eye&mdash;he had a sty coming.
      Soames, impassive, slightly supercilious, did not stay long. He went out
      with a curse stifled behind his pale, just smiling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the peace of his mind, cruelly tortured by the coming
      scandal, he was kept busy day and night with plans for his retirement&mdash;for
      he had come to that grim conclusion. To go on seeing all those people who
      had known him as a &lsquo;long-headed chap,&rsquo; an astute adviser&mdash;after
      that&mdash;no! The fastidiousness and pride which was so strangely, so
      inextricably blended in him with possessive obtuseness, revolted against
      the thought. He would retire, live privately, go on buying pictures, make
      a great name as a collector&mdash;after all, his heart was more in that
      than it had ever been in Law. In pursuance of this now fixed resolve, he
      had to get ready to amalgamate his business with another firm without
      letting people know, for that would excite curiosity and make humiliation
      cast its shadow before. He had pitched on the firm of Cuthcott, Holliday
      and Kingson, two of whom were dead. The full name after the amalgamation
      would therefore be Cuthcott, Holliday, Kingson, Forsyte, Bustard and
      Forsyte. But after debate as to which of the dead still had any influence
      with the living, it was decided to reduce the title to Cuthcott, Kingson
      and Forsyte, of whom Kingson would be the active and Soames the sleeping
      partner. For leaving his name, prestige, and clients behind him, Soames
      would receive considerable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, as befitted a man who had arrived at so important a stage of
      his career, he made a calculation of what he was worth, and after writing
      off liberally for depreciation by the war, found his value to be some
      hundred and thirty thousand pounds. At his father&rsquo;s death, which
      could not, alas, be delayed much longer, he must come into at least
      another fifty thousand, and his yearly expenditure at present just reached
      two. Standing among his pictures, he saw before him a future full of
      bargains earned by the trained faculty of knowing better than other
      people. Selling what was about to decline, keeping what was still going
      up, and exercising judicious insight into future taste, he would make a
      unique collection, which at his death would pass to the nation under the
      title &lsquo;Forsyte Bequest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the divorce went through, he had determined on his line with Madame
      Lamotte. She had, he knew, but one real ambition&mdash;to live on her
      &lsquo;renter&rsquo; in Paris near her grandchildren. He would buy the
      goodwill of the Restaurant Bretagne at a fancy price. Madame would live
      like a Queen-Mother in Paris on the interest, invested as she would know
      how. (Incidentally Soames meant to put a capable manager in her place, and
      make the restaurant pay good interest on his money. There were great
      possibilities in Soho.) On Annette he would promise to settle fifteen
      thousand pounds (whether designedly or not), precisely the sum old Jolyon
      had settled on &lsquo;that woman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from Jolyon&rsquo;s solicitor to his own had disclosed the fact
      that &lsquo;those two&rsquo; were in Italy. And an opportunity had been
      duly given for noting that they had first stayed at an hotel in London.
      The matter was clear as daylight, and would be disposed of in half an hour
      or so; but during that half-hour he, Soames, would go down to hell; and
      after that half-hour all bearers of the Forsyte name would feel the bloom
      was off the rose. He had no illusions like Shakespeare that roses by any
      other name would smell as sweet. The name was a possession, a concrete,
      unstained piece of property, the value of which would be reduced some
      twenty per cent. at least. Unless it were Roger, who had once refused to
      stand for Parliament, and&mdash;oh, irony!&mdash;Jolyon, hung on the line,
      there had never been a distinguished Forsyte. But that very lack of
      distinction was the name&rsquo;s greatest asset. It was a private name,
      intensely individual, and his own property; it had never been exploited
      for good or evil by intrusive report. He and each member of his family
      owned it wholly, sanely, secretly, without any more interference from the
      public than had been necessitated by their births, their marriages, their
      deaths. And during these weeks of waiting and preparing to drop the Law,
      he conceived for that Law a bitter distaste, so deeply did he resent its
      coming violation of his name, forced on him by the need he felt to
      perpetuate that name in a lawful manner. The monstrous injustice of the
      whole thing excited in him a perpetual suppressed fury. He had asked no
      better than to live in spotless domesticity, and now he must go into the
      witness box, after all these futile, barren years, and proclaim his
      failure to keep his wife&mdash;incur the pity, the amusement, the contempt
      of his kind. It was all upside down. She and that fellow ought to be the
      sufferers, and they&mdash;were in Italy! In these weeks the Law he had
      served so faithfully, looked on so reverently as the guardian of all
      property, seemed to him quite pitiful. What could be more insane than to
      tell a man that he owned his wife, and punish him when someone unlawfully
      took her away from him? Did the Law not know that a man&rsquo;s name was
      to him the apple of his eye, that it was far harder to be regarded as
      cuckold than as seducer? He actually envied Jolyon the reputation of
      succeeding where he, Soames, had failed. The question of damages worried
      him, too. He wanted to make that fellow suffer, but he remembered his
      cousin&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; with the uneasy
      feeling that to claim damages would make not Jolyon but himself suffer; he
      felt uncannily that Jolyon would rather like to pay them&mdash;the chap
      was so loose. Besides, to claim damages was not the thing to do. The
      claim, indeed, had been made almost mechanically; and as the hour drew
      near Soames saw in it just another dodge of this insensitive and
      topsy-turvy Law to make him ridiculous; so that people might sneer and
      say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, he got quite a good price for her!&rdquo; And he gave
      instructions that his Counsel should state that the money would be given
      to a Home for Fallen Women. He was a long time hitting off exactly the
      right charity; but, having pitched on it, he used to wake up in the night
      and think: &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do, too lurid; it&rsquo;ll draw
      attention. Something quieter&mdash;better taste.&rsquo; He did not care
      for dogs, or he would have named them; and it was in desperation at last&mdash;for
      his knowledge of charities was limited&mdash;that he decided on the blind.
      That could not be inappropriate, and it would make the Jury assess the
      damages high.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many suits were dropping out of the list, which happened to be
      exceptionally thin that summer, so that his case would be reached before
      August. As the day grew nearer, Winifred was his only comfort. She showed
      the fellow-feeling of one who had been through the mill, and was the
      &lsquo;femme-sole&rsquo; in whom he confided, well knowing that she would
      not let Dartie into her confidence. That ruffian would be only too
      rejoiced! At the end of July, on the afternoon before the case, he went in
      to see her. They had not yet been able to leave town, because Dartie had
      already spent their summer holiday, and Winifred dared not go to her
      father for more money while he was waiting not to be told anything about
      this affair of Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames found her with a letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That from Val,&rdquo; he asked gloomily. &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s married,&rdquo; said Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom to, for Goodness&rsquo; sake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Holly Forsyte, Jolyon&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got leave and did it. I didn&rsquo;t even know he knew her.
      Awkward, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames uttered a short laugh at that characteristic minimisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awkward! Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ll hear about this
      till they come back. They&rsquo;d better stay out there. That fellow will
      give her money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want Val back,&rdquo; said Winifred almost piteously; &ldquo;I
      miss him, he helps me to get on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; murmured Soames. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Dartie behaving
      now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worse; but it&rsquo;s always money. Would you like me
      to come down to the Court to-morrow, Soames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stretched out his hand for hers. The gesture so betrayed the
      loneliness in him that she pressed it between her two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, old boy. You&rsquo;ll feel ever so much better when it&rsquo;s
      all over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; said Soames
      huskily; &ldquo;I never have. It&rsquo;s all upside down. I was fond of
      her; I&rsquo;ve always been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred saw a drop of blood ooze out of his lip, and the sight stirred
      her profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been too bad of her
      all along! But what shall I do about this marriage of Val&rsquo;s, Soames?
      I don&rsquo;t know how to write to him, with this coming on. You&rsquo;ve
      seen that child. Is she pretty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Dark&mdash;lady-like
      enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad,&rsquo; thought Winifred. &lsquo;Jolyon
      had style.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a coil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What will father say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t be told,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;The war&rsquo;ll
      soon be over now, you&rsquo;d better let Val take to farming out there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was tantamount to saying that his nephew was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told Monty,&rdquo; Winifred murmured desolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was reached before noon next day, and was over in little more
      than half an hour. Soames&mdash;pale, spruce, sad-eyed in the witness-box&mdash;had
      suffered so much beforehand that he took it all like one dead. The moment
      the decree nisi was pronounced he left the Courts of Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four hours until he became public property! &lsquo;Solicitor&rsquo;s
      divorce suit!&rsquo; A surly, dogged anger replaced that dead feeling
      within him. &lsquo;Damn them all!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t
      run away. I&rsquo;ll act as if nothing had happened.&rsquo; And in the
      sweltering heat of Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill he walked all the way to
      his City Club, lunched, and went back to his office. He worked there
      stolidly throughout the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way out he saw that his clerks knew, and answered their involuntary
      glances with a look so sardonic that they were immediately withdrawn. In
      front of St. Paul&rsquo;s, he stopped to buy the most gentlemanly of the
      evening papers. Yes! there he was! &lsquo;Well-known solicitor&rsquo;s
      divorce. Cousin co-respondent. Damages given to the blind&rsquo;&mdash;so,
      they had got that in! At every other face, he thought: &lsquo;I wonder if
      you know!&rsquo; And suddenly he felt queer, as if something were racing
      round in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this? He was letting it get hold of him! He mustn&rsquo;t! He
      would be ill. He mustn&rsquo;t think! He would get down to the river and
      row about, and fish. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be laid up,&rsquo; he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flashed across him that he had something of importance to do before he
      went out of town. Madame Lamotte! He must explain the Law. Another six
      months before he was really free! Only he did not want to see Annette! And
      he passed his hand over the top of his head&mdash;it was very hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He branched off through Covent Garden. On this sultry day of late July the
      garbage-tainted air of the old market offended him, and Soho seemed more
      than ever the disenchanted home of rapscallionism. Alone, the Restaurant
      Bretagne, neat, daintily painted, with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees
      therein, retained an aloof and Frenchified self-respect. It was the slack
      hour, and pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for
      dinner. Soames went through into the private part. To his discomfiture
      Annette answered his knock. She, too, looked pale and dragged down by the
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite a stranger,&rdquo; she said languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t wished to be; I&rsquo;ve been busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mother, Annette? I&rsquo;ve got some news for
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is not in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Soames that she looked at him in a queer way. What did she
      know? How much had her mother told her? The worry of trying to make that
      out gave him an alarming feeling in the head. He gripped the edge of the
      table, and dizzily saw Annette come forward, her eyes clear with surprise.
      He shut his own and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve had a touch of the sun, I think.&rdquo;
      The sun! What he had was a touch of &lsquo;darkness! Annette&rsquo;s
      voice, French and composed, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, it will pass, then.&rdquo; Her hand pressed his shoulder,
      and Soames sank into a chair. When the dark feeling dispersed, and he
      opened his eyes, she was looking down at him. What an inscrutable and odd
      expression for a girl of twenty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Soames. Instinct told him that to
      be feeble before her was not helping him&mdash;age was enough handicap
      without that. Will-power was his fortune with Annette, he had lost ground
      these latter months from indecision&mdash;he could not afford to lose any
      more. He got up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to your mother. I&rsquo;m going down to my river
      house for a long holiday. I want you both to come there presently and
      stay. It&rsquo;s just at its best. You will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be veree nice.&rdquo; A pretty little roll of that &lsquo;r&rsquo;
      but no enthusiasm. And rather sadly he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling the heat; too, aren&rsquo;t you, Annette? It&rsquo;ll
      do you good to be on the river. Good-night.&rdquo; Annette swayed forward.
      There was a sort of compunction in the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fit to go? Shall I give you some coffee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Soames firmly. &ldquo;Give me your hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, and Soames raised it to his lips. When he looked
      up, her face wore again that strange expression. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      tell,&rsquo; he thought, as he went out; &lsquo;but I mustn&rsquo;t think&mdash;I
      mustn&rsquo;t worry:
    </p>
    <p>
      But worry he did, walking toward Pall Mall. English, not of her religion,
      middle-aged, scarred as it were by domestic tragedy, what had he to give
      her? Only wealth, social position, leisure, admiration! It was much, but
      was it enough for a beautiful girl of twenty? He felt so ignorant about
      Annette. He had, too, a curious fear of the French nature of her mother
      and herself. They knew so well what they wanted. They were almost
      Forsytes. They would never grasp a shadow and miss a substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremendous effort it was to write a simple note to Madame Lamotte when
      he reached his Club warned him still further that he was at the end of his
      tether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR MADAME (he said),
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see by the enclosed newspaper cutting that I obtained my
      decree of divorce to-day. By the English Law I shall not, however, be free
      to marry again till the decree is confirmed six months hence. In the
      meanwhile I have the honor to ask to be considered a formal suitor for the
      hand of your daughter. I shall write again in a few days and beg you both
      to come and stay at my river house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear Madame,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SOAMES FORSYTE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sealed and posted this letter, he went into the dining-room. Three
      mouthfuls of soup convinced him that he could not eat; and, causing a cab
      to be summoned, he drove to Paddington Station and took the first train to
      Reading. He reached his house just as the sun went down, and wandered out
      on to the lawn. The air was drenched with the scent of pinks and picotees
      in his flower-borders. A stealing coolness came off the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rest-peace! Let a poor fellow rest! Let not worry and shame and anger
      chase like evil night-birds in his head! Like those doves perched
      half-sleeping on their dovecot, like the furry creatures in the woods on
      the far side, and the simple folk in their cottages, like the trees and
      the river itself, whitening fast in twilight, like the darkening
      cornflower-blue sky where stars were coming up&mdash;let him cease from
      himself, and rest!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;PASSING OF AN AGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The marriage of Soames with Annette took place in Paris on the last day of
      January, 1901, with such privacy that not even Emily was told until it was
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the wedding he brought her to one of those quiet hotels in
      London where greater expense can be incurred for less result than anywhere
      else under heaven. Her beauty in the best Parisian frocks was giving him
      more satisfaction than if he had collected a perfect bit of china, or a
      jewel of a picture; he looked forward to the moment when he would exhibit
      her in Park Lane, in Green Street, and at Timothy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some one had asked him in those days, &ldquo;In confidence&mdash;are
      you in love with this girl?&rdquo; he would have replied: &ldquo;In love?
      What is love? If you mean do I feel to her as I did towards Irene in those
      old days when I first met her and she would not have me; when I sighed and
      starved after her and couldn&rsquo;t rest a minute until she yielded&mdash;no!
      If you mean do I admire her youth and prettiness, do my senses ache a
      little when I see her moving about&mdash;yes! Do I think she will keep me
      straight, make me a creditable wife and a good mother for my children?&mdash;again,
      yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more do I need? and what more do three-quarters of the women
      who are married get from the men who marry them?&rdquo; And if the
      enquirer had pursued his query, &ldquo;And do you think it was fair to
      have tempted this girl to give herself to you for life unless you have
      really touched her heart?&rdquo; he would have answered: &ldquo;The French
      see these things differently from us. They look at marriage from the point
      of view of establishments and children; and, from my own experience, I am
      not at all sure that theirs is not the sensible view. I shall not expect
      this time more than I can get, or she can give. Years hence I shouldn&rsquo;t
      be surprised if I have trouble with her; but I shall be getting old, I
      shall have children by then. I shall shut my eyes. I have had my great
      passion; hers is perhaps to come&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose it will be
      for me. I offer her a great deal, and I don&rsquo;t expect much in return,
      except children, or at least a son. But one thing I am sure of&mdash;she
      has very good sense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And if, insatiate, the enquirer had gone on, &ldquo;You do not look, then,
      for spiritual union in this marriage?&rdquo; Soames would have lifted his
      sideway smile, and rejoined: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it may be. If I get
      satisfaction for my senses, perpetuation of myself; good taste and good
      humour in the house; it is all I can expect at my age. I am not likely to
      be going out of my way towards any far-fetched sentimentalism.&rdquo;
      Whereon, the enquirer must in good taste have ceased enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was dead, and the air of the greatest city upon earth grey with
      unshed tears. Fur-coated and top-hatted, with Annette beside him in dark
      furs, Soames crossed Park Lane on the morning of the funeral procession,
      to the rails in Hyde Park. Little moved though he ever was by public
      matters, this event, supremely symbolical, this summing-up of a long rich
      period, impressed his fancy. In &lsquo;37, when she came to the throne,
      &lsquo;Superior Dosset&rsquo; was still building houses to make London
      hideous; and James, a stripling of twenty-six, just laying the foundations
      of his practice in the Law. Coaches still ran; men wore stocks, shaved
      their upper lips, ate oysters out of barrels; &lsquo;tigers&rsquo; swung
      behind cabriolets; women said, &lsquo;La!&rsquo; and owned no property;
      there were manners in the land, and pigsties for the poor; unhappy devils
      were hanged for little crimes, and Dickens had but just begun to write.
      Well-nigh two generations had slipped by&mdash;of steamboats, railways,
      telegraphs, bicycles, electric light, telephones, and now these motorcars&mdash;of
      such accumulated wealth, that eight per cent. had become three, and
      Forsytes were numbered by the thousand! Morals had changed, manners had
      changed, men had become monkeys twice-removed, God had become Mammon&mdash;Mammon
      so respectable as to deceive himself: Sixty-four years that favoured
      property, and had made the upper middle class; buttressed, chiselled,
      polished it, till it was almost indistinguishable in manners, morals,
      speech, appearance, habit, and soul from the nobility. An epoch which had
      gilded individual liberty so that if a man had money, he was free in law
      and fact, and if he had not money he was free in law and not in fact. An
      era which had canonised hypocrisy, so that to seem to be respectable was
      to be. A great Age, whose transmuting influence nothing had escaped save
      the nature of man and the nature of the Universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to witness the passing of this Age, London&mdash;its pet and fancy&mdash;was
      pouring forth her citizens through every gate into Hyde Park, hub of
      Victorianism, happy hunting-ground of Forsytes. Under the grey heavens,
      whose drizzle just kept off, the dark concourse gathered to see the show.
      The &lsquo;good old&rsquo; Queen, full of years and virtue, had emerged
      from her seclusion for the last time to make a London holiday. From
      Houndsditch, Acton, Ealing, Hampstead, Islington, and Bethnal Green; from
      Hackney, Hornsey, Leytonstone, Battersea, and Fulham; and from those green
      pastures where Forsytes flourish&mdash;Mayfair and Kensington, St. James&rsquo;
      and Belgravia, Bayswater and Chelsea and the Regent&rsquo;s Park, the
      people swarmed down on to the roads where death would presently pass with
      dusky pomp and pageantry. Never again would a Queen reign so long, or
      people have a chance to see so much history buried for their money. A pity
      the war dragged on, and that the Wreath of Victory could not be laid upon
      her coffin! All else would be there to follow and commemorate&mdash;soldiers,
      sailors, foreign princes, half-masted bunting, tolling bells, and above
      all the surging, great, dark-coated crowd, with perhaps a simple sadness
      here and there deep in hearts beneath black clothes put on by regulation.
      After all, more than a Queen was going to her rest, a woman who had braved
      sorrow, lived well and wisely according to her lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the crowd against the railings, with his arm hooked in Annette&rsquo;s,
      Soames waited. Yes! the Age was passing! What with this Trade Unionism,
      and Labour fellows in the House of Commons, with continental fiction, and
      something in the general feel of everything, not to be expressed in words,
      things were very different; he recalled the crowd on Mafeking night, and
      George Forsyte saying: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all socialists, they want our
      goods.&rdquo; Like James, Soames didn&rsquo;t know, he couldn&rsquo;t tell&mdash;with
      Edward on the throne! Things would never be as safe again as under good
      old Viccy! Convulsively he pressed his young wife&rsquo;s arm. There, at
      any rate, was something substantially his own, domestically certain again
      at last; something which made property worth while&mdash;a real thing once
      more. Pressed close against her and trying to ward others off, Soames was
      content. The crowd swayed round them, ate sandwiches and dropped crumbs;
      boys who had climbed the plane-trees chattered above like monkeys, threw
      twigs and orange-peel. It was past time; they should be coming soon! And,
      suddenly, a little behind them to the left, he saw a tallish man with a
      soft hat and short grizzling beard, and a tallish woman in a little round
      fur cap and veil. Jolyon and Irene talking, smiling at each other, close
      together like Annette and himself! They had not seen him; and stealthily,
      with a very queer feeling in his heart, Soames watched those two. They
      looked happy! What had they come here for&mdash;inherently illicit
      creatures, rebels from the Victorian ideal? What business had they in this
      crowd? Each of them twice exiled by morality&mdash;making a boast, as it
      were, of love and laxity! He watched them fascinated; admitting grudgingly
      even with his arm thrust through Annette&rsquo;s that&mdash;that she&mdash;Irene&mdash;No!
      he would not admit it; and he turned his eyes away. He would not see them,
      and let the old bitterness, the old longing rise up within him! And then
      Annette turned to him and said: &ldquo;Those two people, Soames; they know
      you, I am sure. Who are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nosed sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see them; just turning away. They know you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Soames answered; &ldquo;a mistake, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lovely face! And how she walk! Elle est tres distinguee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked then. Into his life, out of his life she had walked like
      that swaying and erect, remote, unseizable; ever eluding the contact of
      his soul! He turned abruptly from that receding vision of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better attend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
      coming now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he stood, grasping her arm, seemingly intent on the head of the
      procession, he was quivering with the sense of always missing something,
      with instinctive regret that he had not got them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slow came the music and the march, till, in silence, the long line wound
      in through the Park gate. He heard Annette whisper, &ldquo;How sad it is
      and beautiful!&rdquo; felt the clutch of her hand as she stood up on
      tiptoe; and the crowd&rsquo;s emotion gripped him. There it was&mdash;the
      bier of the Queen, coffin of the Age slow passing! And as it went by there
      came a murmuring groan from all the long line of those who watched, a
      sound such as Soames had never heard, so unconscious, primitive, deep and
      wild, that neither he nor any knew whether they had joined in uttering it.
      Strange sound, indeed! Tribute of an Age to its own death.... Ah! Ah!...
      The hold on life had slipped. That which had seemed eternal was gone! The
      Queen&mdash;God bless her!
    </p>
    <p>
      It moved on with the bier, that travelling groan, as a fire moves on over
      grass in a thin line; it kept step, and marched alongside down the dense
      crowds mile after mile. It was a human sound, and yet inhuman, pushed out
      by animal subconsciousness, by intimate knowledge of universal death and
      change. None of us&mdash;none of us can hold on for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      It left silence for a little&mdash;a very little time, till tongues began,
      eager to retrieve interest in the show. Soames lingered just long enough
      to gratify Annette, then took her out of the Park to lunch at his father&rsquo;s
      in Park Lane....
    </p>
    <p>
      James had spent the morning gazing out of his bedroom window. The last
      show he would see, last of so many! So she was gone! Well, she was getting
      an old woman. Swithin and he had seen her crowned&mdash;slim slip of a
      girl, not so old as Imogen! She had got very stout of late. Jolyon and he
      had seen her married to that German chap, her husband&mdash;he had turned
      out all right before he died, and left her with that son of his. And he
      remembered the many evenings he and his brothers and their cronies had
      wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his
      salad days. And now he had come to the throne. They said he had steadied
      down&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t tell! He&rsquo;d make
      the money fly still, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. What a lot of people out
      there! It didn&rsquo;t seem so very long since he and Swithin stood in the
      crowd outside Westminster Abbey when she was crowned, and Swithin had
      taken him to Cremorne afterwards&mdash;racketty chap, Swithin; no, it didn&rsquo;t
      seem much longer ago than Jubilee Year, when he had joined with Roger in
      renting a balcony in Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolyon, Swithin, Roger all gone, and he would be ninety in August! And
      there was Soames married again to a French girl. The French were a queer
      lot, but they made good mothers, he had heard. Things changed! They said
      this German Emperor was here for the funeral, his telegram to old Kruger
      had been in shocking taste. He should not be surprised if that chap made
      trouble some day. Change! H&rsquo;m! Well, they must look after themselves
      when he was gone: he didn&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;d be! And now Emily
      had asked Dartie to lunch, with Winifred and Imogen, to meet Soames&rsquo;
      wife&mdash;she was always doing something. And there was Irene living with
      that fellow Jolyon, they said. He&rsquo;d marry her now, he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother Jolyon,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;what would he have
      said to it all?&rsquo; And somehow the utter impossibility of knowing what
      his elder brother, once so looked up to, would have said, so worried James
      that he got up from his chair by the window, and began slowly, feebly to
      pace the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was a pretty thing, too,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I was fond
      of her. Perhaps Soames didn&rsquo;t suit her&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t tell. We never had any trouble with our wives.&rsquo; Women
      had changed everything had changed! And now the Queen was dead&mdash;well,
      there it was! A movement in the crowd brought him to a standstill at the
      window, his nose touching the pane and whitening from the chill of it.
      They had got her as far as Hyde Park Corner&mdash;they were passing now!
      Why didn&rsquo;t Emily come up here where she could see, instead of
      fussing about lunch. He missed her at that moment&mdash;missed her!
      Through the bare branches of the plane-trees he could just see the
      procession, could see the hats coming off the people&rsquo;s heads&mdash;a
      lot of them would catch colds, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder! A voice behind
      him said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a capital view here, James!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; muttered James; &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you
      come before? You might have missed it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was silent, staring with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the noise?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no noise,&rdquo; returned Emily; &ldquo;what are you
      thinking of?&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t cheer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, James!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound came through those double panes; what James heard was the
      groaning in his own heart at sight of his Age passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever tell me where I&rsquo;m buried,&rdquo; he said
      suddenly. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo; And he turned from
      the window. There she went, the old Queen; she&rsquo;d had a lot of
      anxiety&mdash;she&rsquo;d be glad to be out of it, he should think!
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily took up the hair-brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be just time to brush your head,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;before they come. You must look your best, James.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered James; &ldquo;they say she&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting with his new daughter-in-law took place in the dining-room.
      James was seated by the fire when she was brought in. He placed, his hands
      on the arms of the chair and slowly raised himself. Stooping and
      immaculate in his frock-coat, thin as a line in Euclid, he received
      Annette&rsquo;s hand in his; and the anxious eyes of his furrowed face,
      which had lost its colour now, doubted above her. A little warmth came
      into them and into his cheeks, refracted from her bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been to see the
      Queen, I suppose? Did you have a good crossing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way he greeted her from whom he hoped for a grandson of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazing at him, so old, thin, white, and spotless, Annette murmured
      something in French which James did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you want your lunch, I expect.
      Soames, ring the bell; we won&rsquo;t wait for that chap Dartie.&rdquo;
      But just then they arrived. Dartie had refused to go out of his way to see
      &lsquo;the old girl.&rsquo; With an early cocktail beside him, he had
      taken a &lsquo;squint&rsquo; from the smoking-room of the Iseeum, so that
      Winifred and Imogen had been obliged to come back from the Park to fetch
      him thence. His brown eyes rested on Annette with a stare of almost
      startled satisfaction. The second beauty that fellow Soames had picked up!
      What women could see in him! Well, she would play him the same trick as
      the other, no doubt; but in the meantime he was a lucky devil! And he
      brushed up his moustache, having in nine months of Green Street
      domesticity regained almost all his flesh and his assurance. Despite the
      comfortable efforts of Emily, Winifred&rsquo;s composure, Imogen&rsquo;s
      enquiring friendliness, Dartie&rsquo;s showing-off, and James&rsquo;
      solicitude about her food, it was not, Soames felt, a successful lunch for
      his bride. He took her away very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Monsieur Dartie,&rdquo; said Annette in the cab, &ldquo;je n&rsquo;aime
      pas ce type-la!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by George!&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister is veree amiable, and the girl is pretty. Your father
      is veree old. I think your mother has trouble with him; I should not like
      to be her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded at the shrewdness, the clear hard judgment in his young
      wife; but it disquieted him a little. The thought may have just flashed
      through him, too: &lsquo;When I&rsquo;m eighty she&rsquo;ll be fifty-five,
      having trouble with me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one other house of my relations I must take you
      to,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find it funny, but we must get it
      over; and then we&rsquo;ll dine and go to the theatre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way he prepared her for Timothy&rsquo;s. But Timothy&rsquo;s was
      different. They were delighted to see dear Soames after this long long
      time; and so this was Annette!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so pretty, my dear; almost too young and pretty for dear
      Soames, aren&rsquo;t you? But he&rsquo;s very attentive and careful&mdash;such
      a good hush....&rdquo; Aunt Juley checked herself, and placed her lips
      just under each of Annette&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;she afterwards described
      them to Francie, who dropped in, as: &ldquo;Cornflower-blue, so pretty, I
      quite wanted to kiss them. I must say dear Soames is a perfect
      connoisseur. In her French way, and not so very French either, I think she&rsquo;s
      as pretty&mdash;though not so distinguished, not so alluring&mdash;as
      Irene. Because she was alluring, wasn&rsquo;t she? with that white skin
      and those dark eyes, and that hair, couleur de&mdash;what was it? I always
      forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feuille morte,&rdquo; Francie prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dead leaves&mdash;so strange. I remember when I was a
      girl, before we came to London, we had a foxhound puppy&mdash;to &lsquo;walk&rsquo;
      it was called then; it had a tan top to its head and a white chest, and
      beautiful dark brown eyes, and it was a lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, auntie,&rdquo; said Francie, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see the
      connection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Aunt Juley, rather flustered, &ldquo;it was so
      alluring, and her eyes and hair, you know....&rdquo; She was silent, as if
      surprised in some indelicacy. &ldquo;Feuille morte,&rdquo; she added
      suddenly; &ldquo;Hester&mdash;do remember that!&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerable debate took place between the two sisters whether Timothy
      should or should not be summoned to see Annette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother!&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no trouble, only of course Annette&rsquo;s being
      French might upset him a little. He was so scared about Fashoda. I think
      perhaps we had better not run the risk, Hester. It&rsquo;s nice to have
      her all to ourselves, isn&rsquo;t it? And how are you, Soames? Have you
      quite got over your....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hester interposed hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of London, Annette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, disquieted, awaited the reply. It came, sensible, composed:
      &ldquo;Oh! I know London. I have visited before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never ventured to speak to her on the subject of the restaurant.
      The French had different notions about gentility, and to shrink from
      connection with it might seem to her ridiculous; he had waited to be
      married before mentioning it; and now he wished he hadn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what part do you know best?&rdquo; said Aunt Juley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soho,&rdquo; said Annette simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames snapped his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soho?&rdquo; repeated Aunt Juley; &ldquo;Soho?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll go round the family,&rsquo; thought Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very French, and interesting,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Aunt Juley, &ldquo;your Uncle Roger had some
      houses there once; he was always having to turn the tenants out, I
      remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames changed the subject to Mapledurham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley, &ldquo;you will be going down
      there soon to settle in. We are all so looking forward to the time when
      Annette has a dear little....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juley!&rdquo; cried Aunt Hester desperately, &ldquo;ring tea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames dared not wait for tea, and took Annette away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mention Soho if I were you,&rdquo; he said in the
      cab. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a shady part of London; and you&rsquo;re
      altogether above that restaurant business now; I mean,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;I want you to know nice people, and the English are fearful snobs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette&rsquo;s clear eyes opened; a little smile came on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; thought Soames, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s meant for me!&rsquo;
      and he looked at her hard. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got good business instincts,&rsquo;
      he thought. &lsquo;I must make her grasp it once for all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Annette! it&rsquo;s very simple, only it wants
      understanding. Our professional and leisured classes still think
      themselves a cut above our business classes, except of course the very
      rich. It may be stupid, but there it is, you see. It isn&rsquo;t advisable
      in England to let people know that you ran a restaurant or kept a shop or
      were in any kind of trade. It may have been extremely creditable, but it
      puts a sort of label on you; you don&rsquo;t have such a good time, or
      meet such nice people&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Annette; &ldquo;it is the same in France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Soames, at once relieved and taken aback.
      &ldquo;Of course, class is everything, really.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annette; &ldquo;comme vous etes sage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; thought Soames, watching her lips,
      &lsquo;only she&rsquo;s pretty cynical.&rsquo; His knowledge of French was
      not yet such as to make him grieve that she had not said &lsquo;tu.&rsquo;
      He slipped his arm round her, and murmured with an effort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Et vous etes ma belle femme.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette went off into a little fit of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, non!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, non! ne parlez pas Francais,
      Soames. What is that old lady, your aunt, looking forward to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames bit his lip. &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
      always saying something;&rdquo; but he knew better than God.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;SUSPENDED ANIMATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The war dragged on. Nicholas had been heard to say that it would cost
      three hundred millions if it cost a penny before they&rsquo;d done with
      it! The income-tax was seriously threatened. Still, there would be South
      Africa for their money, once for all. And though the possessive instinct
      felt badly shaken at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, it recovered by
      breakfast-time with the recollection that one gets nothing in this world
      without paying for it. So, on the whole, people went about their business
      much as if there were no war, no concentration camps, no slippery de Wet,
      no feeling on the Continent, no anything unpleasant. Indeed, the attitude
      of the nation was typified by Timothy&rsquo;s map, whose animation was
      suspended&mdash;for Timothy no longer moved the flags, and they could not
      move themselves, not even backwards and forwards as they should have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspended animation went further; it invaded Forsyte &lsquo;Change, and
      produced a general uncertainty as to what was going to happen next. The
      announcement in the marriage column of The Times, &lsquo;Jolyon Forsyte to
      Irene, only daughter of the late Professor Heron,&rsquo; had occasioned
      doubt whether Irene had been justly described. And yet, on the whole,
      relief was felt that she had not been entered as &lsquo;Irene, late the
      wife,&rsquo; or &lsquo;the divorced wife,&rsquo; &lsquo;of Soames Forsyte.&rsquo;
      Altogether, there had been a kind of sublimity from the first about the
      way the family had taken that &lsquo;affair.&rsquo; As James had phrased
      it, &lsquo;There it was!&rsquo; No use to fuss! Nothing to be had out of
      admitting that it had been a &lsquo;nasty jar&rsquo;&mdash;in the
      phraseology of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what would happen now that both Soames and Jolyon were married again?
      That was very intriguing. George was known to have laid Eustace six to
      four on a little Jolyon before a little Soames. George was so droll! It
      was rumoured, too, that he and Dartie had a bet as to whether James would
      attain the age of ninety, though which of them had backed James no one
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in May, Winifred came round to say that Val had been wounded in the
      leg by a spent bullet, and was to be discharged. His wife was nursing him.
      He would have a little limp&mdash;nothing to speak of. He wanted his
      grandfather to buy him a farm out there where he could breed horses. Her
      father was giving Holly eight hundred a year, so they could be quite
      comfortable, because his grandfather would give Val five, he had said; but
      as to the farm, he didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t tell: he didn&rsquo;t
      want Val to go throwing away his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;he must do something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester thought that perhaps his dear grandfather was wise, because if
      he didn&rsquo;t buy a farm it couldn&rsquo;t turn out badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Val loves horses,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be
      such an occupation for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley thought that horses were very uncertain, had not Montague found
      them so?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;he takes after
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley was sure that dear Val was very clever. &ldquo;I always
      remember,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;how he gave his bad penny to a beggar.
      His dear grandfather was so pleased. He thought it showed such presence of
      mind. I remember his saying that he ought to go into the Navy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester chimed in: Did not Winifred think that it was much better for
      the young people to be secure and not run any risk at their age?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;if they were in London, perhaps;
      in London it&rsquo;s amusing to do nothing. But out there, of course, he&rsquo;ll
      simply get bored to death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester thought that it would be nice for him to work, if he were
      quite sure not to lose by it. It was not as if they had no money. Timothy,
      of course, had done so well by retiring. Aunt Juley wanted to know what
      Montague had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred did not tell her, for Montague had merely remarked: &ldquo;Wait
      till the old man dies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Francie was announced. Her eyes were brimming with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In The Times this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen it, we always read it after dinner; Timothy
      has it till then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you ought to tell us?&rdquo; said Aunt Juley. &ldquo;What
      was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene&rsquo;s had a son at Robin Hill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley drew in her breath. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they
      were only married in March!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Auntie; isn&rsquo;t it interesting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. I was sorry for
      Jolyon losing his boy. It might have been Val.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley seemed to go into a sort of dream. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she
      murmured, &ldquo;what dear Soames will think? He has so wanted to have a
      son himself. A little bird has always told me that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to&mdash;bar
      accidents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gladness trickled out of Aunt Juley&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;November.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a lucky month! But she did wish it could be sooner. It was a long
      time for James to wait, at his age!
    </p>
    <p>
      To wait! They dreaded it for James, but they were used to it themselves.
      Indeed, it was their great distraction. To wait! For The Times to read;
      for one or other of their nieces or nephews to come in and cheer them up;
      for news of Nicholas&rsquo; health; for that decision of Christopher&rsquo;s
      about going on the stage; for information concerning the mine of Mrs.
      MacAnder&rsquo;s nephew; for the doctor to come about Hester&rsquo;s
      inclination to wake up early in the morning; for books from the library
      which were always out; for Timothy to have a cold; for a nice quiet warm
      day, not too hot, when they could take a turn in Kensington Gardens. To
      wait, one on each side of the hearth in the drawing-room, for the clock
      between them to strike; their thin, veined, knuckled hands plying
      knitting-needles and crochet-hooks, their hair ordered to stop&mdash;like
      Canute&rsquo;s waves&mdash;from any further advance in colour. To wait in
      their black silks or satins for the Court to say that Hester might wear
      her dark green, and Juley her darker maroon. To wait, slowly turning over
      and over, in their old minds the little joys and sorrows, events and
      expectancies, of their little family world, as cows chew patient cuds in a
      familiar field. And this new event was so well worth waiting for. Soames
      had always been their pet, with his tendency to give them pictures, and
      his almost weekly visits which they missed so much, and his need for their
      sympathy evoked by the wreck of his first marriage. This new event&mdash;the
      birth of an heir to Soames&mdash;was so important for him, and for his
      dear father, too, that James might not have to die without some certainty
      about things. James did so dislike uncertainty; and with Montague, of
      course, he could not feel really satisfied to leave no grand-children but
      the young Darties. After all, one&rsquo;s own name did count! And as James&rsquo;
      ninetieth birthday neared they wondered what precautions he was taking. He
      would be the first of the Forsytes to reach that age, and set, as it were,
      a new standard in holding on to life. That was so important, they felt, at
      their ages eighty-seven and eighty-five; though they did not want to think
      of themselves when they had Timothy, who was not yet eighty-two, to think
      of. There was, of course, a better world. &lsquo;In my Father&rsquo;s
      house are many mansions&rsquo; was one of Aunt Juley&rsquo;s favourite
      sayings&mdash;it always comforted her, with its suggestion of house
      property, which had made the fortune of dear Roger. The Bible was, indeed,
      a great resource, and on very fine Sundays there was church in the
      morning; and sometimes Juley would steal into Timothy&rsquo;s study when
      she was sure he was out, and just put an open New Testament casually among
      the books on his little table&mdash;he was a great reader, of course,
      having been a publisher. But she had noticed that Timothy was always cross
      at dinner afterwards. And Smither had told her more than once that she had
      picked books off the floor in doing the room. Still, with all that, they
      did feel that heaven could not be quite so cosy as the rooms in which they
      and Timothy had been waiting so long. Aunt Hester, especially, could not
      bear the thought of the exertion. Any change, or rather the thought of a
      change&mdash;for there never was any&mdash;always upset her very much.
      Aunt Juley, who had more spirit, sometimes thought it would be quite
      exciting; she had so enjoyed that visit to Brighton the year dear Susan
      died. But then Brighton one knew was nice, and it was so difficult to tell
      what heaven would be like, so on the whole she was more than content to
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of James&rsquo; birthday, August the 5th, they felt
      extraordinary animation, and little notes passed between them by the hand
      of Smither while they were having breakfast in their beds. Smither must go
      round and take their love and little presents and find out how Mr. James
      was, and whether he had passed a good night with all the excitement. And
      on the way back would Smither call in at Green Street&mdash;it was a
      little out of her way, but she could take the bus up Bond Street
      afterwards; it would be a nice little change for her&mdash;and ask dear
      Mrs. Dartie to be sure and look in before she went out of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Smither did&mdash;an undeniable servant trained many years ago
      under Aunt Ann to a perfection not now procurable. Mr. James, so Mrs.
      James said, had passed an excellent night, he sent his love; Mrs. James
      had said he was very funny and had complained that he didn&rsquo;t know
      what all the fuss was about. Oh! and Mrs. Dartie sent her love, and she
      would come to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunts Juley and Hester, rather hurt that their presents had not received
      special mention&mdash;they forgot every year that James could not bear to
      receive presents, &lsquo;throwing away their money on him,&rsquo; as he
      always called it&mdash;were &lsquo;delighted&rsquo;. it showed that James
      was in good spirits, and that was so important for him. And they began to
      wait for Winifred. She came at four, bringing Imogen, and Maud, just back
      from school, and &lsquo;getting such a pretty girl, too,&rsquo; so that it
      was extremely difficult to ask for news about Annette. Aunt Juley,
      however, summoned courage to enquire whether Winifred had heard anything,
      and if Soames was anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Soames is always anxious, Auntie,&rdquo; interrupted Imogen;
      &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t be happy now he&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words struck familiarly on Aunt Juley&rsquo;s ears. Ah! yes; that
      funny drawing of George&rsquo;s, which had not been shown them! But what
      did Imogen mean? That her uncle always wanted more than he could have? It
      was not at all nice to think like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen&rsquo;s voice rose clear and clipped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine! Annette&rsquo;s only two years older than me; it must be
      awful for her, married to Uncle Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley lifted her hands in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      talking about. Your Uncle Soames is a match for anybody. He&rsquo;s a very
      clever man, and good-looking and wealthy, and most considerate and
      careful, and not at all old, considering everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen, turning her luscious glance from one to the other of the &lsquo;old
      dears,&rsquo; only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley quite severely, &ldquo;that you will
      marry as good a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t marry a good man, Auntie,&rdquo; murmured Imogen;
      &ldquo;they&rsquo;re dull.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on like this,&rdquo; replied Aunt Juley, still very much
      upset, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t marry anybody. We&rsquo;d better not pursue
      the subject;&rdquo; and turning to Winifred, she said: &ldquo;How is
      Montague?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, while they were waiting for dinner, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told Smither to get up half a bottle of the sweet
      champagne, Hester. I think we ought to drink dear James&rsquo; health, and&mdash;and
      the health of Soames&rsquo; wife; only, let&rsquo;s keep that quite
      secret. I&rsquo;ll just say like this, &lsquo;And you know, Hester!&rsquo;
      and then we&rsquo;ll drink. It might upset Timothy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more likely to upset us,&rdquo; said Aunt Nester.
      &ldquo;But we must, I suppose; for such an occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley rapturously, &ldquo;it is an occasion!
      Only fancy if he has a dear little boy, to carry the family on! I do feel
      it so important, now that Irene has had a son. Winifred says George is
      calling Jolyon &lsquo;The Three-Decker,&rsquo; because of his three
      families, you know! George is droll. And fancy! Irene is living after all
      in the house Soames had built for them both. It does seem hard on dear
      Soames; and he&rsquo;s always been so regular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night in bed, excited and a little flushed still by her glass of wine
      and the secrecy of the second toast, she lay with her prayer-book opened
      flat, and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her
      reading-lamp. Young things! It was so nice for them all! And she would be
      so happy if she could see dear Soames happy. But, of course, he must be
      now, in spite of what Imogen had said. He would have all that he wanted:
      property, and wife, and children! And he would live to a green old age,
      like his dear father, and forget all about Irene and that dreadful case.
      If only she herself could be here to buy his children their first
      rocking-horse! Smither should choose it for her at the stores, nice and
      dappled. Ah! how Roger used to rock her until she fell off! Oh dear! that
      was a long time ago! It was! &lsquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house are many
      mansions&mdash;&rsquo;A little scrattling noise caught her ear&mdash;&rsquo;but
      no mice!&rsquo; she thought mechanically. The noise increased. There! it
      was a mouse! How naughty of Smither to say there wasn&rsquo;t! It would be
      eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were, and they
      would have to have the builders in. They were such destructive things! And
      she lay, with her eyes just moving, following in her mind that little
      scrattling sound, and waiting for sleep to release her from it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;BIRTH OF A FORSYTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames walked out of the garden door, crossed the lawn, stood on the path
      above the river, turned round and walked back to the garden door, without
      having realised that he had moved. The sound of wheels crunching the drive
      convinced him that time had passed, and the doctor gone. What, exactly,
      had he said?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the position, Mr. Forsyte. I can make pretty certain of her
      life if I operate, but the baby will be born dead. If I don&rsquo;t
      operate, the baby will most probably be born alive, but it&rsquo;s a great
      risk for the mother&mdash;a great risk. In either case I don&rsquo;t think
      she can ever have another child. In her state she obviously can&rsquo;t
      decide for herself, and we can&rsquo;t wait for her mother. It&rsquo;s for
      you to make the decision, while I&rsquo;m getting what&rsquo;s necessary.
      I shall be back within the hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision! What a decision! No time to get a specialist down! No time
      for anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of wheels died away, but Soames still stood intent; then,
      suddenly covering his ears, he walked back to the river. To come before
      its time like this, with no chance to foresee anything, not even to get
      her mother here! It was for her mother to make that decision, and she
      couldn&rsquo;t arrive from Paris till to-night! If only he could have
      understood the doctor&rsquo;s jargon, the medical niceties, so as to be
      sure he was weighing the chances properly; but they were Greek to him&mdash;like
      a legal problem to a layman. And yet he must decide! He brought his hand
      away from his brow wet, though the air was chilly. These sounds which came
      from her room! To go back there would only make it more difficult. He must
      be calm, clear. On the one hand life, nearly certain, of his young wife,
      death quite certain, of his child; and&mdash;no more children afterwards!
      On the other, death perhaps of his wife, nearly certain life for the
      child; and&mdash;no more children afterwards! Which to choose?.... It had
      rained this last fortnight&mdash;the river was very full, and in the
      water, collected round the little house-boat moored by his landing-stage,
      were many leaves from the woods above, brought off by a frost. Leaves
      fell, lives drifted down&mdash;Death! To decide about death! And no one to
      give him a hand. Life lost was lost for good. Let nothing go that you
      could keep; for, if it went, you couldn&rsquo;t get it back. It left you
      bare, like those trees when they lost their leaves; barer and barer until
      you, too, withered and came down. And, by a queer somersault of thought,
      he seemed to see not Annette lying up there behind that window-pane on
      which the sun was shining, but Irene lying in their bedroom in Montpellier
      Square, as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie, sixteen years
      ago. Would he have hesitated then? Not a moment! Operate, operate! Make
      certain of her life! No decision&mdash;a mere instinctive cry for help, in
      spite of his knowledge, even then, that she did not love him! But this!
      Ah! there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for Annette! Many times
      these last months, especially since she had been growing frightened, he
      had wondered. She had a will of her own, was selfish in her French way.
      And yet&mdash;so pretty! What would she wish&mdash;to take the risk.
      &lsquo;I know she wants the child,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s
      born dead, and no more chance afterwards&mdash;it&rsquo;ll upset her
      terribly. No more chance! All for nothing! Married life with her for years
      and years without a child. Nothing to steady her! She&rsquo;s too young.
      Nothing to look forward to, for her&mdash;for me! For me!&rsquo; He struck
      his hands against his chest! Why couldn&rsquo;t he think without bringing
      himself in&mdash;get out of himself and see what he ought to do? The
      thought hurt him, then lost edge, as if it had come in contact with a
      breastplate. Out of oneself! Impossible! Out into soundless, scentless,
      touchless, sightless space! The very idea was ghastly, futile! And
      touching there the bedrock of reality, the bottom of his Forsyte spirit,
      Soames rested for a moment. When one ceased, all ceased; it might go on,
      but there&rsquo;d be nothing in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. In half an hour the doctor would be back. He must
      decide! If against the operation and she died, how face her mother and the
      doctor afterwards? How face his own conscience? It was his child that she
      was having. If for the operation&mdash;then he condemned them both to
      childlessness. And for what else had he married her but to have a lawful
      heir? And his father&mdash;at death&rsquo;s door, waiting for the news!
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s cruel!&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I ought never to have
      such a thing to settle! It&rsquo;s cruel!&rsquo; He turned towards the
      house. Some deep, simple way of deciding! He took out a coin, and put it
      back. If he spun it, he knew he would not abide by what came up! He went
      into the dining-room, furthest away from that room whence the sounds
      issued. The doctor had said there was a chance. In here that chance seemed
      greater; the river did not flow, nor the leaves fall. A fire was burning.
      Soames unlocked the tantalus. He hardly ever touched spirits, but now&mdash;he
      poured himself out some whisky and drank it neat, craving a faster flow of
      blood. &lsquo;That fellow Jolyon,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;he had
      children already. He has the woman I really loved; and now a son by her!
      And I&mdash;I&rsquo;m asked to destroy my only child! Annette can&rsquo;t
      die; it&rsquo;s not possible. She&rsquo;s strong!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still standing sullenly at the sideboard when he heard the doctor&rsquo;s
      carriage, and went out to him. He had to wait for him to come downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation&rsquo;s the same. Have you decided?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t operate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? You understand&mdash;the risk&rsquo;s great?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Soames&rsquo; set face nothing moved but the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said there was a chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance, yes; not much of one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say the baby must be born dead if you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still think that in any case she can&rsquo;t have another?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t be absolutely sure, but it&rsquo;s most unlikely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s strong,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take the
      risk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at him very gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on your
      shoulders,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;with my own wife, I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo; chin jerked up as if someone had hit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I of any use up there?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; keep away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in my picture-gallery, then; you know where.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded, and went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames continued to stand, listening. &lsquo;By this time to-morrow,&rsquo;
      he thought, &lsquo;I may have her death on my hands.&rsquo; No! it was
      unfair&mdash;monstrous, to put it that way! Sullenness dropped on him
      again, and he went up to the gallery. He stood at the window. The wind was
      in the north; it was cold, clear; very blue sky, heavy ragged white clouds
      chasing across; the river blue, too, through the screen of goldening
      trees; the woods all rich with colour, glowing, burnished-an early autumn.
      If it were his own life, would he be taking that risk? &lsquo;But she&rsquo;d
      take the risk of losing me,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;sooner than lose her
      child! She doesn&rsquo;t really love me!&rsquo; What could one expect&mdash;a
      girl and French? The one thing really vital to them both, vital to their
      marriage and their futures, was a child! &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been through a
      lot for this,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hold on&mdash;hold on.
      There&rsquo;s a chance of keeping both&mdash;a chance!&rsquo; One kept
      till things were taken&mdash;one naturally kept! He began walking round
      the gallery. He had made one purchase lately which he knew was a fortune
      in itself, and he halted before it&mdash;a girl with dull gold hair which
      looked like filaments of metal gazing at a little golden monster she was
      holding in her hand. Even at this tortured moment he could just feel the
      extraordinary nature of the bargain he had made&mdash;admire the quality
      of the table, the floor, the chair, the girl&rsquo;s figure, the absorbed
      expression on her face, the dull gold filaments of her hair, the bright
      gold of the little monster. Collecting pictures; growing richer, richer!
      What use, if...! He turned his back abruptly on the picture, and went to
      the window. Some of his doves had flown up from their perches round the
      dovecot, and were stretching their wings in the wind. In the clear sharp
      sunlight their whiteness almost flashed. They flew far, making a flung-up
      hieroglyphic against the sky. Annette fed the doves; it was pretty to see
      her. They took it out of her hand; they knew she was matter-of-fact. A
      choking sensation came into his throat. She would not&mdash;could not die!
      She was too&mdash;too sensible; and she was strong, really strong, like
      her mother, in spite of her fair prettiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already growing dark when at last he opened the door, and stood
      listening. Not a sound! A milky twilight crept about the stairway and the
      landings below. He had turned back when a sound caught his ear. Peering
      down, he saw a black shape moving, and his heart stood still. What was it?
      Death? The shape of Death coming from her door? No! only a maid without
      cap or apron. She came to the foot of his flight of stairs and said
      breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor wants to see you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran down. She stood flat against the wall to let him pass, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sir! it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over?&rdquo; said Soames, with a sort of menace; &ldquo;what d&rsquo;you
      mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s born, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He dashed up the four steps in front of him, and came suddenly on the
      doctor in the dim passage. The man was wiping his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;quick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both living; it&rsquo;s all right, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stood quite still, covering his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; he heard the doctor say; &ldquo;it was
      touch and go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames let fall the hand which was covering his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;thanks very much. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter&mdash;luckily; a son would have killed her&mdash;the head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The utmost care of both,&rdquo; he hears the doctor say, &ldquo;and
      we shall do. When does the mother come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, between nine and ten, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay till then. Do you want to see them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;before you go. I&rsquo;ll have
      dinner sent up to you.&rdquo; And he went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief unspeakable, and yet&mdash;a daughter! It seemed to him unfair. To
      have taken that risk&mdash;to have been through this agony&mdash;and what
      agony!&mdash;for a daughter! He stood before the blazing fire of wood logs
      in the hall, touching it with his toe and trying to readjust himself.
      &lsquo;My father!&rsquo; he thought. A bitter disappointment, no
      disguising it! One never got all one wanted in this life! And there was no
      other&mdash;at least, if there was, it was no use!
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was standing there, a telegram was brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up at once, your father sinking fast.&mdash;MOTHER.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it with a choking sensation. One would have thought he couldn&rsquo;t
      feel anything after these last hours, but he felt this. Half-past seven, a
      train from Reading at nine, and madame&rsquo;s train, if she had caught
      it, came in at eight-forty&mdash;he would meet that, and go on. He ordered
      the carriage, ate some dinner mechanically, and went upstairs. The doctor
      came out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re sleeping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; said Soames with relief. &ldquo;My
      father&rsquo;s dying; I have to&mdash;go up. Is it all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s face expressed a kind of doubting admiration. &lsquo;If
      they were all as unemotional&rsquo; he might have been saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think you may go with an easy mind. You&rsquo;ll be down
      soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the address.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seemed to hover on the verge of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said Soames abruptly, and turned away. He put on
      his fur coat. Death! It was a chilly business. He smoked a cigarette in
      the carriage&mdash;one of his rare cigarettes. The night was windy and
      flew on black wings; the carriage lights had to search out the way. His
      father! That old, old man! A comfortless night&mdash;to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      The London train came in just as he reached the station, and Madame
      Lamotte, substantial, dark-clothed, very yellow in the lamplight, came
      towards the exit with a dressing-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This all you have?&rdquo; asked Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes; I had not the time. How is my little one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing well&mdash;both. A girl!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl! What joy! I had a frightful crossing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her black bulk, solid, unreduced by the frightful crossing, climbed into
      the brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, mon cher?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; said Soames between his teeth.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up. Give my love to Annette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; murmured Madame Lamotte; &ldquo;quel malheur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames took his hat off, and moved towards his train. &lsquo;The French!&rsquo;
      he thought.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;JAMES IS TOLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      A simple cold, caught in the room with double windows, where the air and
      the people who saw him were filtered, as it were, the room he had not left
      since the middle of September&mdash;and James was in deep waters. A little
      cold, passing his little strength and flying quickly to his lungs. &ldquo;He
      mustn&rsquo;t catch cold,&rdquo; the doctor had declared, and he had gone
      and caught it. When he first felt it in his throat he had said to his
      nurse&mdash;for he had one now&mdash;&ldquo;There, I knew how it would be,
      airing the room like that!&rdquo; For a whole day he was highly nervous
      about himself and went in advance of all precautions and remedies; drawing
      every breath with extreme care and having his temperature taken every
      hour. Emily was not alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next morning when she went in the nurse whispered: &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
      have his temperature taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily crossed to the side of the bed where he was lying, and said softly,
      &ldquo;How do you feel, James?&rdquo; holding the thermometer to his lips.
      James looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of that?&rdquo; he murmured huskily; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was alarmed. He breathed with difficulty, he looked terribly
      frail, white, with faint red discolorations. She had &lsquo;had trouble&rsquo;
      with him, Goodness knew; but he was James, had been James for nearly fifty
      years; she couldn&rsquo;t remember or imagine life without James&mdash;James,
      behind all his fussiness, his pessimism, his crusty shell, deeply
      affectionate, really kind and generous to them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day and the next he hardly uttered a word, but there was in his
      eyes a noticing of everything done for him, a look on his face which told
      her he was fighting; and she did not lose hope. His very stillness, the
      way he conserved every little scrap of energy, showed the tenacity with
      which he was fighting. It touched her deeply; and though her face was
      composed and comfortable in the sick-room, tears ran down her cheeks when
      she was out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About tea-time on the third day&mdash;she had just changed her dress,
      keeping her appearance so as not to alarm him, because he noticed
      everything&mdash;she saw a difference. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use; I&rsquo;m
      tired,&rsquo; was written plainly across that white face, and when she
      went up to him, he muttered: &ldquo;Send for Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, James,&rdquo; she said comfortably; &ldquo;all right&mdash;at
      once.&rdquo; And she kissed his forehead. A tear dropped there, and as she
      wiped it off she saw that his eyes looked grateful. Much upset, and
      without hope now, she sent Soames the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered out of the black windy night, the big house was still as a
      grave. Warmson&rsquo;s broad face looked almost narrow; he took the fur
      coat with a sort of added care, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a glass of wine, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head, and his eyebrows made enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warmson&rsquo;s lips twitched. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asking for you, sir;&rdquo;
      and suddenly he blew his nose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time, sir,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve been with Mr. Forsyte&mdash;a long time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames left him folding the coat, and began to mount the stairs. This
      house, where he had been born and sheltered, had never seemed to him so
      warm, and rich, and cosy, as during this last pilgrimage to his father&rsquo;s
      room. It was not his taste; but in its own substantial, lincrusta way it
      was the acme of comfort and security. And the night was so dark and windy;
      the grave so cold and lonely!
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused outside the door. No sound came from within. He turned the
      handle softly and was in the room before he was perceived. The light was
      shaded. His mother and Winifred were sitting on the far side of the bed;
      the nurse was moving away from the near side where was an empty chair.
      &lsquo;For me!&rsquo; thought Soames. As he moved from the door his mother
      and sister rose, but he signed with his hand and they sat down again. He
      went up to the chair and stood looking at his father. James&rsquo;
      breathing was as if strangled; his eyes were closed. And in Soames,
      looking on his father so worn and white and wasted, listening to his
      strangled breathing, there rose a passionate vehemence of anger against
      Nature, cruel, inexorable Nature, kneeling on the chest of that wisp of a
      body, slowly pressing out the breath, pressing out the life of the being
      who was dearest to him in the world. His father, of all men, had lived a
      careful life, moderate, abstemious, and this was his reward&mdash;to have
      life slowly, painfully squeezed out of him! And, without knowing that he
      spoke, he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his mother cover her eyes and Winifred bow her face towards the
      bed. Women! They put up with things so much better than men. He took a
      step nearer to his father. For three days James had not been shaved, and
      his lips and chin were covered with hair, hardly more snowy than his
      forehead. It softened his face, gave it a queer look already not of this
      world. His eyes opened. Soames went quite close and bent over. The lips
      moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, Father:&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;what&mdash;what news? They never tell....&rdquo; the voice
      died, and a flood of emotion made Soames&rsquo; face work so that he could
      not speak. Tell him?&mdash;yes. But what? He made a great effort, got his
      lips together, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, dear, good&mdash;Annette, a son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; It was the queerest sound, ugly, relieved, pitiful,
      triumphant&mdash;like the noise a baby makes getting what it wants. The
      eyes closed, and that strangled sound of breathing began again. Soames
      recoiled to the chair and stonily sat down. The lie he had told, based, as
      it were, on some deep, temperamental instinct that after death James would
      not know the truth, had taken away all power of feeling for the moment.
      His arm brushed against something. It was his father&rsquo;s naked foot.
      In the struggle to breathe he had pushed it out from under the clothes.
      Soames took it in his hand, a cold foot, light and thin, white, very cold.
      What use to put it back, to wrap up that which must be colder soon! He
      warmed it mechanically with his hand, listening to his father&rsquo;s
      laboured breathing; while the power of feeling rose again within him. A
      little sob, quickly smothered, came from Winifred, but his mother sat
      unmoving with her eyes fixed on James. Soames signed to the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the doctor?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been sent for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do anything to ease his breathing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an injection; and he can&rsquo;t stand it. The doctor said,
      while he was fighting....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not fighting,&rdquo; whispered Soames, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      being slowly smothered. It&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James stirred uneasily, as if he knew what they were saying. Soames rose
      and bent over him. James feebly moved his two hands, and Soames took them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to be pulled up,&rdquo; whispered the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames pulled. He thought he pulled gently, but a look almost of anger
      passed over James&rsquo; face. The nurse plumped the pillows. Soames laid
      the hands down, and bending over kissed his father&rsquo;s forehead. As he
      was raising himself again, James&rsquo; eyes bent on him a look which
      seemed to come from the very depths of what was left within. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      done, my boy,&rsquo; it seemed to say, &lsquo;take care of them, take care
      of yourself; take care&mdash;I leave it all to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes,&rdquo; Soames whispered, &ldquo;yes, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him the nurse did he knew, not what, for his father made a tiny
      movement of repulsion as if resenting that interference; and almost at
      once his breathing eased away, became quiet; he lay very still. The
      strained expression on his face passed, a curious white tranquillity took
      its place. His eyelids quivered, rested; the whole face rested; at ease.
      Only by the faint puffing of his lips could they tell that he was
      breathing. Soames sank back on his chair, and fell to cherishing the foot
      again. He heard the nurse quietly crying over there by the fire; curious
      that she, a stranger, should be the only one of them who cried! He heard
      the quiet lick and flutter of the fire flames. One more old Forsyte going
      to his long rest&mdash;wonderful, they were!&mdash;wonderful how he had
      held on! His mother and Winifred were leaning forward, hanging on the
      sight of James&rsquo; lips. But Soames bent sideways over the feet,
      warming them both; they gave him comfort, colder and colder though they
      grew. Suddenly he started up; a sound, a dreadful sound such as he had
      never heard, was coming from his father&rsquo;s lips, as if an outraged
      heart had broken with a long moan. What a strong heart, to have uttered
      that farewell! It ceased. Soames looked into the face. No motion; no
      breath! Dead! He kissed the brow, turned round and went out of the room.
      He ran upstairs to the bedroom, his old bedroom, still kept for him; flung
      himself face down on the bed, and broke into sobs which he stilled with
      the pillow....
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later he went downstairs and passed into the room. James lay
      alone, wonderfully calm, free from shadow and anxiety, with the gravity on
      his ravaged face which underlies great age, the worn fine gravity of old
      coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked steadily at that face, at the fire, at all the room with
      windows thrown open to the London night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he whispered, and went out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;HIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had much to see to, that night and all next day. A telegram at
      breakfast reassured him about Annette, and he only caught the last train
      back to Reading, with Emily&rsquo;s kiss on his forehead and in his ears
      her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done without you, my dear
      boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached his house at midnight. The weather had changed, was mild again,
      as though, having finished its work and sent a Forsyte to his last
      account, it could relax. A second telegram, received at dinner-time, had
      confirmed the good news of Annette, and, instead of going in, Soames
      passed down through the garden in the moonlight to his houseboat. He could
      sleep there quite well. Bitterly tired, he lay down on the sofa in his fur
      coat and fell asleep. He woke soon after dawn and went on deck. He stood
      against the rail, looking west where the river swept round in a wide curve
      under the woods. In Soames, appreciation of natural beauty was curiously
      like that of his farmer ancestors, a sense of grievance if it wasn&rsquo;t
      there, sharpened, no doubt, and civilised, by his researches among
      landscape painting. But dawn has power to fertilise the most
      matter-of-fact vision, and he was stirred. It was another world from the
      river he knew, under that remote cool light; a world into which man had
      not entered, an unreal world, like some strange shore sighted by
      discovery. Its colour was not the colour of convention, was hardly colour
      at all; its shapes were brooding yet distinct; its silence stunning; it
      had no scent. Why it should move him he could not tell, unless it were
      that he felt so alone in it, bare of all relationship and all possessions.
      Into such a world his father might be voyaging, for all resemblance it had
      to the world he had left. And Soames took refuge from it in wondering what
      painter could have done it justice. The white-grey water was like&mdash;like
      the belly of a fish! Was it possible that this world on which he looked
      was all private property, except the water&mdash;and even that was tapped!
      No tree, no shrub, not a blade of grass, not a bird or beast, not even a
      fish that was not owned. And once on a time all this was jungle and marsh
      and water, and weird creatures roamed and sported without human cognizance
      to give them names; rotting luxuriance had rioted where those tall,
      carefully planted woods came down to the water, and marsh-misted reeds on
      that far side had covered all the pasture. Well! they had got it under,
      kennelled it all up, labelled it, and stowed it in lawyers&rsquo; offices.
      And a good thing too! But once in a way, as now, the ghost of the past
      came out to haunt and brood and whisper to any human who chanced to be
      awake: &lsquo;Out of my unowned loneliness you all came, into it some day
      you will all return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames, who felt the chill and the eeriness of that world-new to him
      and so very old: the world, unowned, visiting the scene of its past&mdash;went
      down and made himself tea on a spirit-lamp. When he had drunk it, he took
      out writing materials and wrote two paragraphs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 20th instant at his residence in Park Lane, James Forsyte,
      in his ninety-first year. Funeral at noon on the 24th at Highgate. No
      flowers by request.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 20th instant at The Shelter; Mapledurham, Annette, wife of
      Soames Forsyte, of a daughter.&rdquo; And underneath on the blottingpaper
      he traced the word &ldquo;son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eight o&rsquo;clock in an ordinary autumn world when he went across
      to the house. Bushes across the river stood round and bright-coloured out
      of a milky haze; the wood-smoke went up blue and straight; and his doves
      cooed, preening their feathers in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole up to his dressing-room, bathed, shaved, put on fresh linen and
      dark clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamotte was beginning her breakfast when he went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at his clothes, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; and
      pressed his hand. &ldquo;Annette is prettee well. But the doctor say she
      can never have no more children. You knew that?&rdquo; Soames nodded.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity. Mais la petite est adorable. Du cafe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames got away from her as soon as he could. She offended him&mdash;solid,
      matter-of-fact, quick, clear&mdash;French. He could not bear her vowels,
      her &lsquo;r&rsquo;s&rsquo;. he resented the way she had looked at him, as
      if it were his fault that Annette could never bear him a son! His fault!
      He even resented her cheap adoration of the daughter he had not yet seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious how he jibbed away from sight of his wife and child!
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have thought he must have rushed up at the first moment. On the
      contrary, he had a sort of physical shrinking from it&mdash;fastidious
      possessor that he was. He was afraid of what Annette was thinking of him,
      author of her agonies, afraid of the look of the baby, afraid of showing
      his disappointment with the present and&mdash;the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent an hour walking up and down the drawing-room before he could
      screw his courage up to mount the stairs and knock on the door of their
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamotte opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! At last you come! Elle vous attend!&rdquo; She passed him, and
      Soames went in with his noiseless step, his jaw firmly set, his eyes
      furtive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annette was very pale and very pretty lying there. The baby was hidden
      away somewhere; he could not see it. He went up to the bed, and with
      sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are then, Soames,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not so bad
      now. But I suffered terribly, terribly. I am glad I cannot have any more.
      Oh! how I suffered!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stood silent, stroking her hand; words of endearment, of sympathy,
      absolutely would not come; the thought passed through him: &lsquo;An
      English girl wouldn&rsquo;t have said that!&rsquo; At this moment he knew
      with certainty that he would never be near to her in spirit and in truth,
      nor she to him. He had collected her&mdash;that was all! And Jolyon&rsquo;s
      words came rushing into his mind: &ldquo;I should imagine you will be glad
      to have your neck out of chancery.&rdquo; Well, he had got it out! Had he
      got it in again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must feed you up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon be
      strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see baby, Soames? She is asleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed round the foot of the bed to the other side and stood staring.
      For the first moment what he saw was much what he had expected to see&mdash;a
      baby. But as he stared and the baby breathed and made little sleeping
      movements with its tiny features, it seemed to assume an individual shape,
      grew to be like a picture, a thing he would know again; not repulsive,
      strangely bud-like and touching. It had dark hair. He touched it with his
      finger, he wanted to see its eyes. They opened, they were dark&mdash;whether
      blue or brown he could not tell. The eyes winked, stared, they had a sort
      of sleepy depth in them. And suddenly his heart felt queer, warm, as if
      elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma petite fleur!&rdquo; Annette said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleur,&rdquo; repeated Soames: &ldquo;Fleur! we&rsquo;ll call her
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of triumph and renewed possession swelled within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By God! this&mdash;this thing was his! By God! this&mdash;this thing was
      his!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
